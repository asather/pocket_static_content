<h1>AIU experiences malware attack on servers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny Intermediate Unit said Thursday that an unknown entity recently encrypted portions of its network with malware and demanded a ransom payment in exchange for the software to be released.</p>
<p>The agency said it worked with third-party forensic specialists to investigate and restore the network, and they have not found evidence that the entity accessed or acquired any personal or protected information stored on the servers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The AIU had backup versions of the most critical information and was able to restore&nbsp;access to the vast majority of the impacted files without engaging or paying the intruder,” the agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>The investigation, however, remains ongoing, and the AIU said it will provide formal notification to anyone whose sensitive information was contained on the serves involved in the incident.</p>
<p>The AIU said it was reviewing its policies to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the AIU declined to comment on whether the agency had contacted law enforcement.</p>
<p>The AIU is a public education agency that provides services, resources and research to&nbsp;Allegheny County's 42 suburban school districts as well as non-public, charter and vocational-technical schools.</p>
