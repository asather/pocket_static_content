<h1>The Steelers' 'Madden NFL 21' ratings aren't very pretty</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Electronic Arts has been dropping select portions of its player ratings for its “<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-21/player-ratings" target="_blank">Madden NFL 21” </a>video game at a seemingly glacial pace over the past week-plus. Some rookies here. Top 10 players at a skill position there. They were really milking it.</p>
<p>The Steelers were mostly absent from those early releases, but fortunately, their full team ratings have finally arrived. Here’s an overview of how the hometown heroes stack up against the competition. And spoiler alert: They’re not pretty.</p>
<p><strong>Quarterback</strong></p>
<p>Ben Roethlisberger may make comfortably more than any other player on the roster, but Madden is bearish about his ability to bounce back from the elbow surgery that ended his 2019 campaign. His 81 rating is only 12th-best on the team and 15th among quarterbacks league-wide. So right around league average. The good news for him? He’s still second-best in the AFC North division, trailing only Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson with a 94 rating.</p>
<p><strong>Running back</strong></p>
<p>James Conner’s injury history has cast doubt on his future with the Steelers. Madden seems doubtful about his talents while healthy, too. The game puts him in a tie for 28th among backs league-wide with a mediocre 81 rating. It doesn’t see much upside in Conner’s backups either; Jaylen Samuels and Benny Snell share 72 ratings while rookie Anthony McFarland checks in with a 67.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wide receiver</strong></p>
<p>You might be sensing a theme about the offense’s skill positions at this point. JuJu Smith-Schuster leads the group with an 86 rating, which is good, but not great. He’s 20th among receivers, barely scraping his way onto the first page. No other Steelers receiver cracks 80. James Washington and Diontae Johnson are pegged at 78 and 76, respectively, putting them well below average for second and third options in the passing game.</p>
<p><strong>Tight end</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the one spot where Madden seems to have some optimism for the Steelers. The offseason acquisition of Eric Ebron receives high marks, as he garners an 84 rating, 12th-best at the position. That puts him eight points ahead of teammate Vance McDonald, who’s at 76, so Ebron is seen as a substantial upgrade. Whether things will play out that way in reality remains to be seen. <em>(*cough* Ladarius Green *cough*)</em> But at least on paper, Madden seems to like the signing a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Offensive line</strong></p>
<p>Quite the spray chart of ratings here. Guard David DeCastro leads the group — and, in fact, the team — with a 91 rating. Center Maurkice Pouncey isn’t too far behind at 86, and tackle Alejandro Villanueva checks in with a respectable 82. Behind them, though? Woof. Matt Feiler comes in a distant fourth on the team with a 71 rating, followed by free agent signing Stefan Wisniewski (68), Chukwuma Okorafor (66) and Kevin Dotson (63.) So those guys have some things to prove.</p>
<p><strong>Defensive line</strong></p>
<p>The first real strength we’ve seen so far. Cam Heyward is second on the team with a 90 rating that puts him 10th among defensive ends league-wide. On the opposite side, Stephon Tuitt’s perception didn’t suffer much from his season-ending injury in 2019. He’s right there next to Heyward with an 87.</p>
<p><strong>Linebackers</strong></p>
<p>Here we have by far the biggest head scratcher on the team. T.J. Watt finished third in last season’s Defensive Player of the Year voting, but he’s not even ranked in the top three at his own position by Madden. Not even close. The game lists him 13th among linebackers with an 86 rating, behind guys including Tampa Bay’s Lavonte David, New Orleans’ Demario Davis and Minnesota’s Eric Kendricks, none of whom were even close to being in the conversation. Something’s amiss there. Pass-rushing tag team partner Bud Dupree does OK with an 80 — though that’s probably not what any fan wants to see for a guy playing under the franchise tag. Vince Williams checks in with a 77. And Devin Bush gets a 76 despite himself finishing third in the Defensive Rookie of the Year race.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary</strong></p>
<p>The snubs continue. Minkah Fitzpatrick was voted an All-Pro safety in 2019 alongside the New York Jets’ Jamal Adams. Madden, however, believes there are fully 10 better player at his position. He ranks 11th at the position with an 87 rating. And you have to scroll to the third page of defensive backs to find Pro Bowler Joe Haden, who’s rated an 83. Hmm. The one redeeming quality Madden seems to see in the Steelers’ secondary is depth. Mike Hilton and Steven Nelson both get solid 81 ratings. Only Terrell Edmunds fared poorly among regulars with a 74.</p>
<p><strong>Special teams</strong></p>
<p>Chris Boswell’s bounce-back season was well-received by the game. He’s third among kickers with an 82 rating. Punter Jordan Berry gets a mediocre 75.</p>
