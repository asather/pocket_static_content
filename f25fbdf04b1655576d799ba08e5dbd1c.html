<h1>'Not a lot of date nights': Steelers are changing things up amid COVID-19 landscape</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With the NFL <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/10/05/roger-goodell-nfl-forfeits-covid-19-protocol-violations/stories/202010050115" target="_blank">threatening more stringent penalties</a> for violations of COVID-19 protocols, the Steelers will have to be even more diligent with what they do, where they go and who they see once they leave the antiseptic environment of their South Side practice facility. And they’ve been pretty conscientious so far.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, it is not always easy for young 20-something athletes who are accustomed to a flexible and free lifestyle to do that for nearly three months. But it is also difficult for players with families, as well, mainly because spouses and children don’t have to live in the same type of restricted bubble that they do.</p>
<p>Now it becomes even more important with the league threatening to take away draft choices and consider forfeiture of games for teams who recklessly violate protocol and create unintended situations, much like the one in Tennessee that forced postponement of the Steelers-Titans game on Sunday. It just might be that the team with the most discipline will be the team with the most victories at the end of the season.</p>
<p>So what’s a player to do?</p>
<p>Well, Ben Roethlisberger said his three kids are being home-schooled and he and his wife are not having guests to their home. Defensive end Cam Heyward said there are fewer stops on the way home and no more date nights with his wife. Cornerback Steven Nelson said he spends most of his time with his family and rarely goes out. Linebacker Bud Dupree said he might go to the grocery store once he gets home, but that’s about it. And rookie receiver Chase Claypool said he hangs out with his teammates, whether at the facility or one of their homes, because he hasn’t been in town long enough to meet new friends and hang out with them anyway.</p>
<p>“We need to be cautious, be careful, protect each other,” Roethlisberger said. “There are new challenges that arise. This week ... fans are allowed in the stadium, which means we’re allowed to have guests. In the Roethlisberger family, we’re not changing anything. Hopefully guys will continue to be cautious and as careful as we have been to this point.”</p>
<p>The Steelers were one of three NFL teams who did not have a player elect to opt-out of the 2020 season because of concerns about the virus. And they have not had a player test positive since training camp. Their commitment to wanting to play, and then doing what is necessary to ensure they do, is all part of Mike Tomlin’s mantra that “one fail, all fail.”</p>
<p>That’s why Tomlin said he agrees with the league’s threat to punish teams for negligence but is not concerned about what the discipline should be or the Steelers failure to comply with the expanded protocols. Those include players wearing masks and gloves at practice and the introduction of a league-wide video system to monitor whether players and staff are wearing protective equipment inside the team facility and while traveling.</p>
<p>“I have been focused on running this football outfit and making sure we are adhering to the protocols that are delivered to us out of New York,” Tomlin said.</p>
<p>And his players are trying to do their best to cooperate.</p>
<p>“I have to be cognizant of my environment and the people I’m around,” said Heyward, who has three kids at home. “Basically it’s here to home and minimize outside contact with people. I might pick my kids up now and then from school. There’s not a lot of date nights. There’s no extra-curricular activities.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty much the same thing I’ve always done,” Nelson said. “I’m a family guy, so I go home and be with my family. That’s the easiest way to stay away from everybody and kind of isolate yourself.”</p>
<p>“With this situation and the way the world is now, me, personally, I only go from practice to home and then to the grocery store if need be,” Dupree said. “You just stay home and don’t try to do anything extra like you normally do in a season. Just think about your team first.”</p>
<p>Unlike the NBA and NHL, the NFL does not operate inside a bubble, at least, not outside each team’s practice facility. The New Orleans Saints have tried to create one, housing most of their players in an empty luxury hotel near the French Quarter. But, with 69 players (counting practice squad), 15-20 coaches, any number of trainers, equipment people and medical personnel, it is difficult to keep everyone together and isolated to stay out of harm’s way.</p>
<p>So NFL coaches have been instructive about one very important aspect: Try to stay inside when away from the practice facility. Invariably, though, someone will want to go somewhere, whether a restaurant (those that are open), a small party or just a friend’s house. And, if it isn’t them, maybe someone in their immediate family. That might be the most determining factor in which teams win the most games in 2020 — can the players remain disciplined?</p>
<p>“The team that handles this thing the best is going to have the best chance of winning that trophy,” Los Angeles Chargers coach Anthony Lynn told his players during an episode of HBO’s “Hard Knocks” earlier this summer.</p>
<p>And it’s not just the players venturing outside their little bubble that can cause a problem. It’s having family members or friends wanting to stop and visit. Claypool, a Canadian citizen, hasn’t had to worry about that with his family. They are from British Columbia, and he hasn’t seen them since shortly after the April draft. He said they won’t be visiting because they would have to quarantine for at least 14 days once they return home.</p>
<p>So he spends his time hanging out with teammates, though he does admit to going for a massage (fingers crossed) a couple times a week.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty simple for me,” Claypool said. “I know my teammates and that’s about it. I don’t know too many people I can hang out with anyway. So, after the facility, I’ll hang out with my teammates here or when that’s done we’ll go back home and play games. It’s pretty simple routine.”</p>
<p>The type it might take to win a championship.</p>
