<h1>Pence motorcade involved in 2 minor accidents enroute to Greensburg campaign stop</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Journalists in Mike Pence’s motorcade reported two minor crashes outside Pittsburgh Thursday morning — one involving the bus carrying the vice president and a dump truck and another two motorcycle escorts. Pence was not injured.</p>
<p>The motorcade was enroute to a police rally in Greensburg.</p>
<p>Reporter Elizabeth Crisp with Newsweek said via Twitter that the&nbsp;Trump campaign bus had a fender-bender with a truck and that Pence transferred to a limousine for the rest of the route.</p>
<p>The motorcade reportedly came to a standstill around 11 a.m. and was back on the road about a half hour later.</p>
<p>Moments later at 11:18 a.m., two motorcycle officers escorting the vice president went down in White Oak. They were evaluated at the scene and did not suffer serious injuries.</p>
<p>"Grateful for all of the law enforcement officers who support us and help get us safely to where we are going each day. Thank you for all you do!" Pence told reporters, according to NBC News.</p>
<p>The vice president’s event at the Greensburg Police Department will bring together the “Cops for Trump” coalition, one of the campaign’s many groups designed to coalesce around President Donald Trump’s re-election platform.</p>
<p>Following the rally, Pence was expected to tour the Guy Chemical Co. in Somerset.</p>
