<h1>World briefs: Pompeo to visit Ukraine amid trial </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As impeachment drama plays out in Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will travel to Ukraine — the country at the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat will be in the capital, Kyiv, on Thursday and Friday. He will be the first administration official to travel there since the impeachment of President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Mr. Pompeo was initially scheduled to visit Ukraine, along with several other countries, earlier this month. That trip was postponed because of “the ongoing situation in Iraq,” spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>According to the State Department, Mr. Pompeo will meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko, Defense Minister Andriy Zahorodnyuk and other leaders.</p>
<p>Ahead of the original trip, a senior State Department official told reporters that the leaders would discuss issues including security assistance, reform and strengthening the rule of law. However, that official didn’t denythat Mr. Pompeo could also raise the prospect of the investigations sought by Mr. Trump into his political rival Joe Biden, Mr. Biden’s son Hunter and the debunked theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.</p>
<p>Numerous witnesses in the impeachment investigation testified that it was their understanding that a White House visit for Mr. Zelenskiy and military aid to Ukraine were conditioned on a public announcement of these investigations.</p>
<p><strong>Aussie fires’ big impact</strong></p>
<p>The Australia bush fires, which are still burning and claimed an additional three lives this week, have released enough greenhouse gases to double that country’s annual greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, new scientific estimates show.</p>
<p>Guido van der Werf, who helps maintain the Global Fire Emissions Database, says the fires in New South Wales and Victoria states in particular have emitted about 400 million tons of carbon dioxide so far, “pushing country-level estimates for all of 2019 to a new record in the satellite era” of about 900 million tons of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>The smoke plumes have circled the globe, coated glaciers brown in New Zealand and led to reddish sunsets in South America.</p>
<p>In a typical fire year in Australia, large amounts of grasslands burn in sparsely populated areas. The carbon emitted by these fires tends to be reabsorbed during the following wet season.</p>
<p>However, this year, vast forest ecosystems that serve as long-term carbon savings accounts — having taken in carbon and stored it in biomass — went up in flames, such as in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales. This carbon was released during the fires, and it could take decades for the forests to recover.</p>
<p><strong>Man kills 6 relatives</strong></p>
<p>A 26-year-old German man fatally shot six of his relatives Friday, police said, a rare mass shooting in a country which has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe.</p>
<p>The victims included the suspect’s 65-year-old father and 56-year-old mother, said police spokesman David Ebert. He said police think the other four victims, two men and two women, were also relatives. Two others were wounded.</p>
<p>The shooting took place at the family home, in a residential building above a bar in the small southwestern town of Rot am See, which has a population of just over 5,000. After the shooting, the suspect called the police, surrendering when authorities arrived.</p>
<p>Police said they could not speculate as to motive Friday evening.</p>
