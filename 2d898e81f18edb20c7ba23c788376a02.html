<h1>Obituary: Former Panthers administrator Alex Kramer was 'a true Pitt gem'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There was no interview back in 1978. Jackie Sherrill didn’t need Alex Kramer to explain why he was qualified for the role of Pitt’s director of football operations.</p>
<p>During Sherrill’s three years as defensive coordinator and first year as head coach, he saw Kramer, a lifelong Pitt fan, at fundraising events and basketball games. He became familiar with Kramer’s outgoing personality. And he quickly found out that Kramer — because of his “gracious” nature — knew everybody in and around the Pitt community.</p>
<p>“He was one of the best hires we ever had,” Sherrill told the Post-Gazette on Wednesday afternoon. “I just asked him if he would like to be a part of our program. And unequivocally and without any hesitation, I mean, it was like 10 birthdays wrapped up in one for him.”</p>
<p>Kramer left his academic role with Moon Area School District to join Pitt. And from that point forward, he served as an invaluable link to five head coaches and remained an unwavering supporter of the Panthers until his final days.</p>
<p>Kramer died Tuesday at the age of 91. He was preceded in death by his wife, Betty McCormick, and he is survived by their children, Charles and Michele.</p>
<p>“His love and devotion to Pitt was absolute,” Pitt historian and author Sam Sciullo Jr. said. “There was no hidden agenda. There was no self-interest or self-promotion attached to his involvement with the program. It was strictly a 100% love for the university and the program.”</p>
<p>Kramer’s official Pitt tenure spanned 17 seasons from 1978 until his retirement in July 1995. He served Sherrill and four other head coaches: Foge Fazio (1982-85), Mike Gottfried (1986-89), Paul Hackett (1990-92) and Johnny Majors (1993-94).</p>
<p>Kramer oversaw team travel and weekly routines, as well as operating as a liaison to other university offices. He led Pitt’s community efforts, personally organizing the “John Pruitt Children’s Hospital Volunteer Group.” And after retirement, he served as the chairman emeritus of the Sutherland Restoration Fund, which beautified the Homewood Cemetery gravesite of legendary Pitt coach Jock Sutherland.</p>
<p>Kramer was known for his encyclopedic mind, which stemmed from his deeper connection to Pitt than simply 17 years on staff.</p>
<p>Kramer became a fan of Pitt in the Sutherland days of the 1930s. The Taylor Allderdice graduate saw his first Panthers game in 1941 with his brother, Bernie, an upset of No. 3 Fordham at Pitt Stadium. In 1947, Kramer joined Pitt’s football program as a student manager. He roomed with future Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker Joe Schmidt, graduated from Pitt in 1952 and earned his master’s degree from the university in 1961 after a four-year enlistment in the Air Force.</p>
<p>Kramer — later a member of the Pitt Athletics Hall of Fame selection committee — used his sharp mind and welcoming personality to help Sherrill, Majors and other coaches connect with the surrounding community. He was a “statue with the players and with the alumni,” Sherrill said. Which was clear Wednesday as many around the Pitt program expressed their condolences.</p>
<p>Former Panthers defensive back and current ESPN analyst Louis Riddick said on Twitter that Kramer was “synonymous” with Pitt. EJ Borghetti, Pitt’s longtime associate athletic director, called Kramer a “mentor.” Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke described the former administrator as “a true Pitt gem.” And head coach Pat Narduzzi said Kramer “represented what it means to be a Pitt Man.”</p>
<p>Sciullo Jr. will remember Kramer as “a guy who put out fires” and took care of the little details. He recalled Kramer “jumping through hoops” with the team hotel staff back in 1979 to get former offensive lineman Mark May a big enough bed when Pitt traveled to Washington for a road game.</p>
<p>Kramer — who was named an Awardee of Distinction by the Pitt Varsity Letter Club in 1997 — “reflected the very, very best of this university,” Borghetti said. That’s how Sciullo Jr. will remember him, too.</p>
<p>“He’s one of my best friends,” Sciullo Jr. said. “I’m sad, but at the same time, at 91 years old, he lived a great life and affected a lot of people in a positive way. He’ll never be forgotten, that’s for sure.”</p>
