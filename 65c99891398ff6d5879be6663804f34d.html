<h1>Fitzgerald, Bogen take part in clinical trial for COVID-19 vaccine</h1>

<p>If you want to beat ’em, join them.</p>
<p>That’s the plan for Rich Fitzgerald and Dr. Debra Bogen, who on Wednesday said they are taking part in a clinical trial to develop a vaccine against COVID-19.</p>
<p>During the weekly news conference, the Allegheny County executive and the county’s health director said they each received a shot in the arm — Dr. Bogen on Monday, Mr. Fitzgerald on Wednesday.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“I received an injection that was either the vaccine or the placebo — I&nbsp;don’t know which one I received,” Dr. Bogen said. “The researchers conducting the study don’t know which one I received. And I’ll get a second shot in about a month. And I will not find out until the study ends which [one] I received.</p>
<p>“Other than a sore arm, I feel great,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald and Dr. Bogen are two of 750 people in the region recruited by UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh to take part in the national COVID-19 Prevention Network and Operation Warp Speed to accelerate the creation of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent people from getting the deadly viral disease.</p>
<p>The county officials are part of a Phase 3 trial to test and RNA-based vaccine developed by Cambridge, Mass.-based Moderna Inc.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh is one of 87 locations around the county taking part in the global effort to stop the disease.</p>
<p>While Moderna was the first company to begin clinical trials in the U.S., there are at least 162 other efforts around the country and the globe, including three underway at Pitt.</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen said it was important that she participate.</p>
<p>“… [B]ased on my experiences as both a mother and a pediatrician, my experience with clinical research and my sincere hope and desire for an effective and safe vaccine against COVID-19, I volunteered to participate in a vaccine trial taking place both across the country and locally through the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC.</p>
<p>“As a pediatrician, I have great confidence in vaccines. Vaccines save lives and reduce health care costs.”</p>
<p>Before Dr. Bogen and Mr. Fitzgerald could participate, they were screened by Dr. Judy Martin, the director of the Pittsburgh Vaccine Clinical Trials Unit at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh and director of the Moderna vaccine trial locally.</p>
<p>“As part of the trial, Dr. Judy Martin and a team of nurses and staff determined that I met study entry criteria, reviewed the consent form with me thoroughly and answered all of my questions,” Dr. Bogen said. “They completed questionnaires about my health, they conducted a physical exam, obtained a nasopharyngeal swab and collected blood.”</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald, who joked that his arm hasn’t become sore yet, said the region is at the forefront of the health industry, so participating in the trial wasn’t a difficult decision.</p>
<p>“Anybody that can help out and be part of the finding [of] a cure and vaccine for this, we owe it to ourselves, and we owe it to the community to try to do that,” he said. “We're proud of our health care professionals here, the researchers, the people who've been working for many years with many breakthroughs. Obviously, this is one that’s top of mind for everybody in the region, and across the country, and across the world.”</p>
<p>While the shot is out of the way, the trial isn’t finished for either Mr. Fitzgerald or Dr. Bogen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Over the next two years, I’ll be monitored, I’ll return to the clinic for follow-up appointments, I’m going to give lots of blood, monitor my health for symptoms of COVID-19, and hopefully help researchers determine if this is an effective vaccine,” Dr. Bogen said.</p>
<p>She said at least one more trial will be starting in the area “over the next few months in addition to the one already underway.”</p>
<p>Like the current trial, the next one also will need 750 participants.</p>
<p>“I encourage people to consider volunteering,” Dr. Bogen said.&nbsp;“It’s essential that we get wide representation in these clinical trials, so we know if the vaccines work well in all people.”</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen said she looks forward to when she can visit family and friends without the fear of spreading disease.</p>
<p>“I want to be part of the solution,” she said.</p>
