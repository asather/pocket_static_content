<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Cole Tucker isn’t going to Indianapolis without a fight.</p>
<p>Tucker played sound defense at second base and hit a towering home run in the Pirates’ 9-7 split-squad loss against the Atlanta Braves on Wednesd</p>
<p>He has a hit in five of the seven games in which he’s played this spring. One of the biggest questions surrounding Tucker is his ability to hit in the majors. It’s only spring, but he’s perhaps starting to show that his bat can play at the big-league level.</p>
<p>“I feel great about my timing and the things I’ve done with my swing,” Tucker said. “I’ve been working on my body positioning and always being on time with the swing. I’ve worked to be in a more athletic place at the plate. It’s all about swing decisions and being on time.”</p>
<p>Mike Soroka made the All-Star Game last season and is one of the best young pitchers in baseball. Tucker caught him slipping on a fastball and blasted it over the Pirates bullpen and onto the boardwalk in left field.</p>
<p>“I knew that he was going to attack with the fastball, so I wanted to beat him to the spot,” Tucker said. “Baseball is so hard. Any time it gives you a nugget of success off a guy like that, you take it.”</p>
<p>The Pirates took a lead they held until the ninth inning. Greyson Jenista and Sean Kazmar Jr. hit late-inning home runs as the Braves took the win. The Pirates are 2-10-1 in Grapefruit League action.</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Trevor Williams had a good outing Wednesday with three innings pitched. He allowed one run on a deep home run by Braves farmhand first baseman Peter O’Brien in the second inning.</p>
<p>Williams had a good sense of humor about the homer.</p>
<p>“If you’re gonna give ’em up, then give it all the way up,” Williams said with a smile.</p>
<p>O’Brien hit another home run against Chris Stratton later the game.</p>
<p>Williams had good velocity on his fastball and threw his off-speed pitches for strikes. The curveball, especially, was sound.</p>
<p>“Overall, I felt I had a good pitch mix,” said Williams, who struck out three. “I threw everything and in every count today. I feel like I had a good body of work out there.”</p>
<p>Richard Rodriguez struck out two of the three batters he faced in the fifth.</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>Williams worked out of a jam in the first inning. He started the game by striking out Dansby Swanson. Nick Markakis followed with a double, and Freddie Freeman drew a walk to put runners on first and second with one out.</p>
<p>Williams threw a slider that Travis d’Arnaud hit toward the mound. He gathered the ball quickly and threw it to Tucker, who was playing second base and completed the double play with a throw to Josh Bell.</p>
<p>Tucker was playing second to give Oneil Cruz a start at shortstop.</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>Bell also hit a two-run home run in the third inning. The long blast to left-center field was Bell’s first spring home run. Bryan Reynolds walked twice against Soroka. Reynolds also hit his first home run of spring training in the fifth inning.</p>
<p><strong>The other group</strong></p>
<p>Hector Noesi had a rough outing by allowing four earned runs on five hits, including a Bryce Harper home run, as the Pirates fell to the Phillies, 9-7, in Clearwater. Noesi threw two innings with a walk and two strikeouts.</p>
<p>Kevin Kramer went 2-for-3&nbsp;and played six innings in left field. Adam Frazier hit his first spring training home run. Ke’Bryan Hayes was 1-for-3 and has reached base safely in six of his first eight games.</p>
