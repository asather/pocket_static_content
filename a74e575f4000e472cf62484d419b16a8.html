<h1>Pitt to drastically reduce faculty, staff presence on its campuses; WVU's campus absent of all non-essentials</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Senior administrators at all University of Pittsburgh locations have been instructed to shrink their operating presence markedly "to reduce — to an absolute minimum — the need for faculty and staff to be on our campuses."</p>
<p>Pitt Chancellor Patrick Gallagher informed the university <a href="https://officeofthechancellor.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/j/D9C79059DC9F177F2540EF23F30FEDED/D63CC634B881A646EBAD456BEB5F1DD6" target="_blank">in a statement late Wednesday</a>, citing the escalating public health response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>West Virginia University also announced closure of its main Morgantown campus and two others, save for a select group of employees needed for tasks including online instruction.</p>
<p>At Pitt, Mr. Gallagher said essential teaching and research functions will be sustained and that faculty and staff would continue to be paid, while working remotely. The plan is to achieve a reduced posture by 5 p.m. Friday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"While many of our activities have <a title="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/16/University-of-Pittsburgh-Duquesne-IUP-COVID19-health-pandemic-CCAC-State-System-Cathedral-pennsylvania/stories/202003160075" href="/" target="_blank">already moved online</a> and our on-campus population has dramatically decreased, this transition will affect many remaining activities," Mr. Gallagher said.</p>
<p>Pitt officials will be announcing closure of many on-campus academic support facilities, save for specific personnel.</p>
<p>"These changes will affect access to nearly all of the remaining shared facilities, such as libraries, recreational facilities, computer labs, study areas and group spaces, that are currently available to University faculty, staff and students," he said.</p>
<p>WVU officials said all other&nbsp;employees not essential to remote operations will work from home and residence halls will remain shuttered.</p>
<p>“It is clear the pace of this pandemic will only continue to grow across the United States,” President E. Gordon Gee said. “Our medical experts share that there is little chance of it slowing down — unless we quickly and accurately implement measures that can impede the community spread and ‘flatten the curve.”</p>
<p>He said public health officials have suggested the pandemic may last well past the scheduled end of the semester in mid-May. WVU's board met in emergency session Wednesday and approved the moves. It has not yet decided on commencement but expects to do so by March 25.</p>
<p>WVU and Pitt, like other institutions, are now teaching remotely to curb the spread of the coronavirus. At Pitt, the changes will mean most of the university's thousands of faculty, administrators and staff on the main Oakland campus and the Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown and Titusville branches will be working from home.</p>
<p>Pitt has 34,000 students in all. Total enrollment at WVU is approximately 30,000.</p>
<p>"Access to laboratories and other research facilities will be restricted to identified personnel who have a specific need to be on campus, supporting essential activities or associated facilities and equipment,” he explained.</p>
<p>Additional measures as needed may include "staggering schedules; requiring minimum distances between individuals; disinfection; personal protective equipment; and other strategies,” the chancellor said.</p>
<p>Vice Provost and Dean of Students Kenyon Bonner will be issuing guidance later today to students who remain on campus.</p>
<p>"Students who must or have elected to stay on campus should note that these changes will severely limit the facilities and services available to them," Mr. Gallagher wrote.</p>
