<h1>Virtual races let runners slow down and find new meaning in the sport</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jennifer Cowden spent months training to run her first half-marathon, and was feeling a little more nervous every day. Then, the coronavirus pandemic hit. For a moment, everything came crashing down when the race was moved to a virtual format and her hard work seemed to go down the drain.</p>
<p>She didn’t give up on herself so easily, despite being admittedly “hesitant” about participating in a virtual race. Instead, Ms. Cowden, 32, of Eighty Four, Washington County, decided to continue training in order to reach her goal.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>To Ms. Cowden, the race was a success, completing it alongside friends instead of a group of strangers. Her parents could even watch her run since there were no large crowds of spectators.</p>
<p>“We all said we were going to do it still,” Ms. Cowden said. “You had the people you were used to running with and training with. You had that support right there with you still.”</p>
<p>Just like Ms. Cowden, runners across Western Pennsylvania have been adapting to a change of scenery during the pandemic —&nbsp;from running alongside large groups to pushing through alone. Many 5Ks and marathons that were initially planned for the summer were forced to be canceled or moved to a virtual format to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Virtual races and events allow runners to register online and complete miles wherever they can, on their own time. By the day of the race, participants submit their times to compete with other registrants in the event. While some races mail medals to winners, many runners&nbsp;see the pandemic as an opportunity to reflect on their personal strengths and what running means to them.</p>
<p>Laura Powell, 32, of Crafton, didn’t expect to enjoy running alone until she began participating in virtual races and challenges. Ms. Powell said she often felt discouraged during races due to her slower pace. In a virtual race, though, she can focus on her endurance rather than feeling pressured by other runners.</p>
<p>“I don’t have to compare myself to coming in last and coming in first,” Ms. Powell said.</p>
<p>Quitting might seem like an easier option for someone running alone, but Ms. Powell said virtual races give her a “reason” to run every day. In January, Ms. Powell made a commitment to run 1,000 miles by the end of 2020 and believes virtual races are her motivation to continue striving for that goal.</p>
<p>Sarah Wallace, 39, of Squirrel Hill said the pandemic has allowed her to reflect on what running means to her. Given the freedom to complete miles her own way, Ms. Wallace has traded speed for greater mileage, adding that she’s not worried how she ends a race anymore.</p>
<p>“The goals I’m setting are about spending time outside and logging miles [while] getting away from work and other stressors,” she said. “I’ve improved in the sense that I’ve given myself more freedom to listen to my body [on] what feels right that day.”</p>
<p>Running was always fun for her before, though Ms. Wallace is beginning to find more enjoyment in the sport with less pressure to compete. Early in the summer, she planned her own virtual challenge called the “Cat Nap 100,” where she would get up to run in the middle of the night to run 25 miles before several hours of rest.</p>
<p>Andrew Mascio, co-owner of Wolf Creek Race Management in Butler, believes virtual challenges like the Cat Nap 100 will continue to be popular long after the pandemic subsides. Mr. Mascio said all races eventually end, but a challenge gives a runner something to work toward every day by building up their miles. One popular challenge in Pennsylvania includes running the length of the state north to south or east to west by the end of August.</p>
<p>Wolf Creek is planning an in-person race in late July, which Mr. Mascio described as&nbsp;“challenging” due to all of the new safety precautions such as masks, plexiglass and packaged meals. Nonetheless, the regulations aren’t enough to keep some runners away who want the chance to participate in-person again.</p>
<p>Darlene Upson, 64, of Unity Township, Westmoreland County, starts running at 6:00 a.m. every day, saying she “has no time to waste” because of her age. However, Ms. Upson said she has difficulty finding the motivation to run in a race without the spectators.</p>
<p>“You lose the excitement of the crowd. … When you’re with a large group and you’re at the start line, you have that adrenaline rush,” Ms. Upson said. “It’s just not the same, because you don’t have that excitement there.”</p>
<p>Ms. Upson had plans to compete in her first triathlon in April, but had to create her own race with friends after the event was canceled. Complete with several wrong turns and someone flipping over in a kayak, Ms. Upson said it was fun though it didn't compare to the real thing.</p>
<p>High school runners are hoping to hit the course again in person for the school year as well. Colby Belczyk, 17, anticipated his spring track season with Riverside High School in Beaver County to be one of his best after a successful indoor season until it abruptly ended. Eventually, he took a month and a half off to rest, but is gearing up toward the fall cross country season by training with runners throughout the county.</p>
<p>While the support from the crowds have disappeared for now, most runners have replaced the spectators with a small group of friends and family who motivate them every day. For some, the encouragement comes within themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You’re capable of anything you put your mind to. You’re your only limitations,” Ms. Cowden said.</p>
