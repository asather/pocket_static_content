<h1>Troy Polamalu donates restaurant gift cards to furloughed Westmoreland County workers</h1>

<p>Troy Polamalu is both a Hall of Fame football player and a Hall of Fame person.</p>
<p>As first reported by the Tribune-Review, the legendary Steelers safety and his wife, Theodora Holmes, this week provided an extra meal or two for the more than 400 furloughed government workers in Westmoreland County by giving them gift cards to local restaurants. It’s a huge help for the out-of-work employees, their families and the businesses in desperate need of a financial boost.</p>
<p>“Everyone is going through a very difficult time right now,” Westmoreland County commissioner Gina Cerilli told the Post-Gazette. “Our employees, our local businesses. So this is a win-win for the Polamalus to be able to step up like this.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Cerilli said that she was contacted by a third party about two weeks ago who told her the Polamalus had heard about the hardships furloughed governments workers were facing through the media and wanted to do something for the Westmoreland County employees who lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>At first, they thought about buying gift cards to grocery stories. They eventually decided to support local restaurants and families in one fell swoop. The furloughed workers will receive $25 gift cards through the mail later this week, according to Cerilli.</p>
<p>“Nobody works in county government to get rich,” she said. “… When we had to furlough the employees, it was a very difficult decision. We’re very appreciative for the Polamalus for stepping up and being able to put a dinner on their tables.”</p>
<p>Cerilli pointed to the fact that Polamalu — who spent 12 seasons in the NFL, all as a Steeler, before his 2015 retirement — spent a month every summer in Latrobe for Steelers training camp as the reason he felt so connected to Westmoreland County and wanted to contribute to their relief efforts.</p>
<p>Westmoreland commissioner Sean Kertes sees Polamalu’s dedication to a county in which he no longer has any real stake as a sign of just how much everyone from all walks of life are uniting for the common good during this crisis.</p>
<p>“As a former Steeler who no longer lives in the area, Polamalu reaching out and helping the community is phenomenal and shows how deep the roots are in this community for helping each other and coming together,” Kertes said.</p>
<p>Many furloughed government workers are living paycheck to paycheck and some have yet to received their stimulus checks from the federal government, according to Cerilli. Polamalu’s donation will hopefully assuage one of their basic needs for at least a little while.</p>
<p>“In this terrible time, it’s great to show the community coming together,” Cerilli said. “Of all the people stepping up, to have the Hall of Famer Troy Polamalu stepping up, it means a lot to all of us.”</p>
