<h1>KDKA news anchors Susan Koeppen, Rick Dayton laid off amid sweeping ViacomCBS reductions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>KDKA-TV laid off anchors Susan Koeppen and Rick Dayton on Wednesday as the CBS News division announced cuts both nationally and at its owned-and-operated local stations.</p>
<p>In December, a ViacomCBS merger was created. In streamlining operations, layoffs on the entertainment side as well as news side have ensued.</p>
<p>Ms. Koeppen had been with KDKA since 2011, and anchored the 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts Tuesday. Mr. Dayton was a morning anchor who joined the station in 2009. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>“I am going to miss the amazing people I work with. I had such fantastic co-workers… and the people of Pittsburgh have always been wonderful to me,” said Ms. Koeppen, who has won seven regional Emmy awards.</p>
<p>“The silver lining is, I get to spend more time with my children and be a great mom to them. And I’ll figure out what’s next. But I can only be positive.”</p>
<p>Ms. Koeppen had worked at WTAE for four years until 2004, when she left for New York and a job as consumer investigator with CBS’s “The Early Show.” She began at KDKA after the show was revamped.</p>
<p>Shortly after returning to Pittsburgh in 2011, she was out running with friends when she suffered a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2012/01/24/KDKA-s-Susan-Koeppen-found-life-changed-in-just-a-heartbeat/stories/201201240165" target="_blank">cardiac incident</a> that nearly killed her.</p>
<p>“Nov. 20 changed my life forever, and it made me really appreciate life to the fullest: to live my life every single day with purpose,” she said.</p>
<p>“So I’m looking at this [layoff] as ‘All right, what is the silver lining? What is the positive here?’”</p>
<p>“Things happen in life, and you have got to get through it. You have got to be positive and you have got to do your best.”</p>
<p>In early March, KDKA began its streaming news service, CBSN Pittsburgh as the network expanded its round-the-clock local coverage.</p>
<p>KDKA general manager Chris Cotugno, in confirming the layoffs, emailed a corporate statement: “We are restructuring various operations at CBS as part of our ongoing integration with Viacom, and to adapt to changes in our business, including those related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Our thoughts today are with our departing colleagues for their friendship, service and many important contributions to CBS.”</p>
<p>Hours after Ms. Koeppen and Mr. Dayton were laid off, their bios were removed from the KDKA website.</p>
<p>An earlier round of ViacomCBS reductions were concentrated mostly on the new company’s cable television side. Pittsburgh was far from the only local O&amp;O station affected Wednesday; WBBM in Chicago reportedly has lost at least a dozen people including news and sports anchors.</p>
