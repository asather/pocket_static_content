<h1>How Pirates prospect Jared Oliva is using Bryan Reynolds as a guide</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — One of the best parts of spring training is watching young players get closer to living out their big league dreams. The first time at big league camp is a rite of passage that frequently draws a line of demarcation between success and failure.</p>
<p>How a burgeoning athlete handles competing with and against major leaguers is essential to how a career pans out. Jared Oliva is a potential future replacement for Starling Marte in center field for the Pirates. The 24-year-old is ready to accept the challenge of performing at the highest level.</p>
<p>“It’s an excellent opportunity to be here,” Oliva said. “[I] kind of knew I would possibly get the opportunity. But when you officially get the invite, that’s when you know, ‘Hey, there’s a chance here.’ It’s a really good opportunity to be here, just around all the guys, around the new coaching staff.”</p>
<p>Oliva wasn’t always as sure last season. He struggled during the first half of the season in Class AA Altoona. But in the second half he had a .277 batting average along with six home runs, 42 RBIs and 36 stolen bases and scored 70 runs.</p>
<p>Oliva further cemented the camp invite with his performance in the Arizona Fall League.&nbsp;He hit .312 and led the league with 12 doubles and 11 stolen bases. Oliva’s 29 hits and 14 walks were second in the league, and he&nbsp;showed a unique combination of discipline at the plate and speed on the bases. Now he’s hoping that translates to progress in 2020.</p>
<p>“We applied most of the things that helped me in the second half. Got through a rough start in the first half, we fixed some things,” Oliva said. “I got adjusted to the pitching. But I felt like I was in a good spot heading to fall league to really compete and see where I stood against some other top people in the league, or in the minor leagues.”</p>
<p>Oliva’s best game in spring training was against the Phillies last Sunday. He hit 1-for-3 and scored a run. Oliva also showed off his arm in turning a double play from center.</p>
<p>“He’s a good ballplayer,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “He’s a great athlete and is very smart. He wants to make the right play. We like the work he’s doing.”</p>
<p>Oliva might not make the team out of camp. But in a lot of ways, his journey is similar to that of Bryan Reynolds. Oliva, despite being the son of an MLB player, wasn’t highly recruited out of high school. He had to walk on at the University of Arizona. Reynolds only got one scholarship offer, and it was to Vanderbilt. Both men weren’t exactly high on any prospects lists even though they’ve had success at every level.</p>
<p>“People sometimes come up with all these numbers to show all the flaws in a guy instead of trusting what they see,” Reynolds said. “It’s clear how good Jared is when you watch him play. He hits the ball hard, He runs well and can play defense.”</p>
<p>Oliva is hoping that when his number gets called, he’ll catch people by surprise as Reynolds did.</p>
<p>“It’s cool for anybody making their big league debut, but especially someone growing up, coming through the system like us,” Oliva said. “Reynolds doing so well was great because it’s good to see guys from a similar age group get the shot and do well, and then help the big league club.</p>
<p>“It’s no surprise that he had the season he did. It was a great year, but everyone knew he was a really good player. And it was refreshing to see him get the opportunity. It’s also ‘Hey, he was here in Altoona last year.’</p>
<p>If Oliva is going to be next, he knows the work will only get harder. He’s working on his power. Oliva hasn’t been much of a home run hitter, but he believes that can improve.</p>
<p>“The big thing this offseason was, from the hitting standpoint, be in a more consistent spot to do damage,” Oliva said. “I feel like that’s the last tool for me in my baseball maturity.</p>
<p>“A lot of it was working from the ground up, from making sure my leg kick is more efficient, that I’m using my hips, my legs.”</p>
<p>Oliva will most likely start the season in Class AAA Indianapolis. He knows he’s only one phone call away from Pittsburgh, so he has to be ready.</p>
<p>“I’m here for a reason. I got invited for a reason,” Oliva said. “I want to contribute to the Pittsburgh Pirates. I want to help the big league club win games. I know that [I need] to keep working to make sure I’m at my best when they call me.”</p>
