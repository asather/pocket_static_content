<h1>Derek Shelton explains Pirates' lineup changes for series finale</h1>

<p>ST. LOUIS — It’s not a response, Pirates manager Derek Shelton said.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">What Sunday’s adjusted lineup represents more than anything, Shelton insisted, is something that was scripted, a process for him that often starts four or five days in advance.</span></p>
<p>However, with the Pirates’ offense sputtering, the changes are noticeable:</p>
<p>• Josh Bell will move from cleanup to the No. 3 spot, while Colin Moran will bump up to No. 4. Those two have five of the Pirates’ 11 hits thus far.</p>
<p>• Kevin Newman will get a day off, and Shelton — for now — will turn to Adam Frazier over Jarrod Dyson in the leadoff spot.</p>
<p>• And for the third consecutive game, the Pirates will have a different right fielder. This time, it’s Jose Osuna.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“This was scripted out,” Shelton said. “This was set before we played the first game. There was no reactionary [decision] at all on anything. It’s just not how I’m going to roll on that.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">No matter the reason, the Pirates need a spark. They’ve gone down in order 12 times in 18 innings and have just one extra-base hit. The top three hitters over the previous two days are hitting .087 (2-for-23).</span></p>
<p><strong>Home opener talk</strong></p>
<p>Steven Brault has started 10 times against the Brewers in his career, while six of those have come at Miller Park.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, and for reasons way beyond this, it will be a little different when Brault gets the ball Monday for the Pirates home opener.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">For one, there won’t be any fans in the stands. But Brault also figures to be part of a piggybacking situation that he hinted could involve Chad Kuhl following him.</span></p>
<p>“It’s extremely exciting,” Brault said. “You know, we did talk about — Chad and I and Shelty — how it’s kind of not necessarily the same as a regular home opener. It’s probably more of a scheduling thing, where Shelty felt it made the most sense. So it’s not necessarily the same, but I will take the honor, for sure. I’m excited to throw a home opener.”</p>
<p>Shoulder issues plagued Brault at times last season and again during spring training 1.0, forcing the left-hander to adjust his mechanics. So far, Brault said, the adjustments to his arm angle and stride have stuck.</p>
<p>The best-case scenario for Brault would be for him to work three innings against the Brewers, matching the most he’s thrown thus far during “Summer Camp.” It’s likely Kuhl will follow with somewhere around the same number.</p>
<p>One change for Brault will be that he isn’t watching from the stands, under a green tent that has been installed to promote social distancing among players.</p>
<p>That’s how Brault has viewed the Pirates’ two games thus far, chatting with pitchers a little too much — “Pitchers are kind of lame and boring,” Brault joked — and also coming to the conclusion that baseball is really, really hard.</p>
<p>“We’re watching our intrasquads, and we’re sitting behind home plate, in the stands, with a little bit of an angle behind home plate,” Brault said. “You realize, if I were a fan sitting in this seat right now, I’d be like, ‘How could you ever hit that?’ People throw so hard, and the ball moves so much.</p>
<p>“It kind of puts into perspective if you’re pitching like, ‘Just throw it over the plate. It’s so hard to hit.’ It’s definitely a different perspective on things.”</p>
<p><strong>Polanco progress</strong></p>
<p>Shelton said that Gregory Polanco (COVID-19) continues to work out at PNC Park, and the reports they’ve received on him are encouraging.</p>
<p>The manager also said that he would likely use Polanco as the designated hitter for his first game back, whenever that may be.</p>
<p>“It’s been good,” Shelton said. “I talked to [Polanco] two days ago. The reports have been good. I know he’s working out again [Sunday]. As we continue to see him and get eyes on him, we’ll make an evaluation on when he’ll be back.”</p>
<p>As for where Polanco will hit when he returns, Shelton said he has not yet made that decision.</p>
