<h1>Officials removing bodies from ‘overwhelmed’ Brooklyn funeral home</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Officials were back at a Brooklyn funeral home Thursday, removing bodies that weren't properly cared for inside the home, a law enforcement official tells CNN.</p>
<p>A day earlier, officials discovered four trucks containing as many as 60 bodies outside the Andrew Cleckley Funeral Home after someone reported fluids dripping from the trucks, according to the law enforcement official.</p>
<p>It's unclear how many bodies will be removed, the official said Thursday.</p>

<p>Authorities have also asked the owner to gather paperwork that would help identify the bodies.</p>
<p>The Department of Environmental Protection issued two summonses to the owner of the funeral home for a foul odor.</p>
<p>The funeral home was overwhelmed and ran out of room for bodies, which were awaiting cremation, and used the trucks for storage, a second law enforcement source said Wednesday.</p>
<p>At least one of the trucks was unrefrigerated, according to one law enforcement official. One source said the bodies were put on ice.</p>
<p>"They were like almost everyone, doing their best to cope," one source said.</p>
<p>Andrew T. Cleckley, the owner of the funeral home, said in an interview on Thursday that, like other funeral directors in New York, he had been overwhelmed by the relentless tide of bodies during the pandemic. Cleckley said he had used the trucks for overflow storage, but only after he had filled his chapel with more than 100 corpses.</p>
<p>“I ran out of space,” he said. “Bodies are coming out of our ears.”</p>
<p>New York has been the epicenter of the US coronavirus outbreak for weeks, with 17,866 confirmed and probable Covid-19 deaths, according to the city website.</p>
<p>New York has freezer trucks that funeral homes can use if they are overwhelmed, and the city sent one to hold the bodies, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/health/100-bodies-found-in-unrefrigerated-trailers-outside-nyc-funeral-home-police-source/6138044/" target="_blank">CNN affiliate WABC reported</a>.</p>
<p>"Funeral directors are required to store decedents awaiting burial or other final disposition in appropriate conditions and to follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions," the New York State Health Department said in a statement regarding the incident.</p>
<p>What happened in Brooklyn appears to be an extreme case, and state health officials said Thursday they would investigate the matter. But in the past two months, funeral home directors have begun to store bodies in viewing rooms and chapels, turning up their air-conditioning systems to avoid decomposition. Some are transporting bodies to other cities and states to be cremated.</p>
<p>Some hospitals ran out of body bags — the city has since distributed 20,000 — and others have used forklifts to transfer piles of corpses into makeshift mobile morgues. So many people have been dying at home that the medical examiner's office has turned to teams of soldiers working around the clock to pick them up.</p>
<p>Cemeteries have scrambled to meet the need for burials, and the city’s four crematories are backed up for weeks. To stave off a secondary public health emergency, any bodies left unclaimed for 14 days were, for a time, being buried at a potter’s field on Hart Island in the Bronx.</p>
<p>For the families of the dead, the overloaded system has turned the already painful act of mourning into a kind of anxious torture. Some have found it hard to track the bodies of their loved ones as they move from morgue to morgue. Others have had trouble hiring hearses, which are now in high demand.</p>
