<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 07.22.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi folks. Welcome to my weekly chat. Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to leave your questions now, and I'll be back at noon to answer them. -- Mackey. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, and away we go ...</p>
<p><strong>Bob</strong>: What does a bench coach and quality control coach do? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Couple different things, Bob. The most notable thing you're seeing a bench coach do now is Don Kelly running spring training 1.0 and 2.0. The bench coach should also be something of a conduit to players -- alerting them if they're starting or sitting, monitoring attitudes, etc. He might assist in strategy or present ideas. There aren't defined rules, but it's sort of a Jr. Manager kinda thing. Quality control coach can be used a bunch of different ways. There are teams that want this guy to focus more on analytics and how they're being implemented. Maybe it's making sure players understand this info or not how to get it. Could be look-aheads on opponents or examining positioning. Even help with pitching. A lot of different things.</p>
<p><strong>Walter</strong>: I have no question to pose, just a friendly reminder to everyone who may have already forgotten during these crazy times. The Houston Astros are arrogant cheaters and should forever have an asterisk next to their names. Good day. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Ha. I admire your dedication to the cause, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>Nivek Morris</strong>: A lot of folks have given their opinions on what Pirate players will have break-out seasons, but which ones do you think are most likely to go in the opposite direction? Did Josh Bell, Kevin Newman, or Bryan Reynolds have career years last year? Is Jacob Stallings going to be able to replicate his acceptable 2019 batting this season? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hmm ... so you're asking who's gonna take a step backward. ... Not Reynolds. Not Bell, either. Both have looked excellent. And honestly, I have a tough time seeing that from Newman or Stallings, either. Although Stallings would be more from a defensive standpoint. ... I don't really see anyone who fits into this particular question, Nivek. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Mel</strong>: Jason, with the wealth of middle infielders currently on the Pirates roster ,it makes perfect sense to use their defensive skills at other positions. When most little league teams are formed the best players are usually up the defensive middle players,shortstops,second basemen ,center fielders and catchers. Through their careers and physical growth they may play other positions. These players are athletic and can play multiple positions. Tucker can certainly play the outfield and could get better with practice. They could find the correct player and position in this time. Why not? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Mel. I have no issue with them trying Tucker in center field. For a couple reasons. One, they need to find out what they have in him. Can he hit major league pitching? Honestly, we don't know. Same time, I don't wanna take at-bats away from Newman or Frazier. Newman because he's a building block for me, Frazier because I think he's probably most valuable as a trade piece. If Tucker hits, OK; then let's evaluate defense. If he sticks in center, I have my CF of the future. If he doesn't, but he hits, I know him or Newman could play second. Meanwhile, you have a need for outfielders in a transition year. I'm all for it. I just think they need to do it the right way: Ease him into it. I've heard people saying he should start there Friday. C'mon. You're putting him in a position to fail. Need to let him work on it a little.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan</strong>: Any news on Cederlind? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>Jdk717</strong>: I don't see this team winning 15 games. Last year was bad and now they are without Marte, Vazquez and Archer. They have 3 legit starters, no closer (yet), no Polanco (shocker), the bullpen looks like a train wreck etc. I like the new management team, but it's going to be a tough year. What's your forecast on wins? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think they'll win more than 15 games. Before Kela and Polanco went out, I thought the Pirates would flirt with .500. Those hurt, though they're hardly permanent. At this point I'd say 26-30.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: The bullpen looks terrible what can the Pirates do to fix it at this point? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Gene. I agree it has not been good. And honestly, if this is what it is, there's little they can do. They're in trouble. But we're also forming opinions on their bullpen based off of two games. I think some patience is required here.</p>
<p><strong>Blackhawk Bob</strong>: Will there be any financial gain for the Pirates if the Blue Jays play in Pittsburgh and if so what will be done with the money ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think so, at least not for the Pirates. Any rent the Blue Jays would pay would go to the SEA, which owns PNC Park. (Legally-speaking, the Pirates are also renters.) I can't speak for what the SEA might do with that money.</p>
<p><strong>thomastown</strong>: You did a good job covering the pros and cons of the Blue Jays playing at PNC park. It’s interesting to think there will be real Major League Baseball played there rather than just games involving the glorified minor league team that usually plays there. Now it’s sounds like this will likely happen. Since there will be no fans attending and I assume no local TV, do you think there will be any local interest in these games and how do you and your colleagues plan to cover them. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You know the Blue Jays won two fewer games than the Pirates last season, right? I agree they have more young talent, but let's not act like we're getting the '27 Yankees here. That said, I'm psyched. I think it's so neat that is going to happen. I'm not sure what we're going to do, honestly. I think I need to talk about it with my bosses at the P-G and see what our strategy will be. I think some of it will depend on if people read the stuff, too. If they do, I don't see why we wouldn't staff something happening at PNC Park. I just question whether the interest will be this high the entire time.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Hey Jason. Since the Puig signing with the Braves fell through because of a positive test have the Pirates shown any interest in him? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Donna, I don't believe they have. Such a shame, too. They clearly do not see that he's the ticket to a World Series.</p>
<p><strong>Krugerrand</strong>: Jason, if fans were permitted in the stands, which team, do you think, would sell more seats, Pirates or Blue Jays? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: The Pirates, easy. After all of this time at home, I don't care if the Pirates are trotting out an outfield of Derek Bell, Chad Hermanson and J.J. Davis, people will come and watch, if for no other reason than it would feel at least somewhat normal. I think people will follow the Blue Jays, but it'll be hard because there's no emotion built up there, even if right now most of that is anger for Pittsburgh's baseball team.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>: Have you heard if the Pirates will be compensated for letting the Bluejays play at PNC? Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Answered this one above, Jay. They will benefit financially in no way, other than perhaps advertising Pittsburgh, PNC Park and looking like the good guys in this. The SEA owns PNC Park. Blue Jays would have to pay rent to them, not to the building's tenant.</p>
<p><strong>Cole T</strong>: Should I be positive or slightly paranoid about my new found outfield position? I thought I was better than those other guys defensively at short? And my bat is not exactly lumber company material. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Cole, my man. Give it a shot. Could be really good for you. Newman has to play. He has hit more than you. Frazier, too. And we're not gonna move our Gold Glove finalist second baseman (other teams, yinz catch that? GOLD GLOVE) to another position and risk having anything change with a tradable asset. So, get a bigger glove.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: any chance pirates could lose 50 games this year <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think so, but I'm pretty sure there's a large subsection of Pirates fans who think they'll lose 61 in a 60-game season.</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: Any inclination that the Bucs are/will look at any of the guys being released/opting out? I am thinking relief arms and maybe another OFer. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: If a guy opts out for one team, he's not gonna change his mind for another. Won't be allowed. Also, no. It would not sync with their entire MO to this point, which has basically been bare bones additions -- only the stuff they ABSOLUTELY had to do -- while evaluating what they have and acquiring talent at the lower levels.</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: Sorry, I meant guys opting out of minor league contracts they signed with other teams, not guys opting out of playing due to Covid. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Ah, I gotcha. Thank you for clarifying. Honestly, I don't think it changes anything for them. People won't like that, but I don't think they feel the need to extend themselves at all right now for the future, again, other than what they have to do. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Have a Pirates Zoom call right now, folks, will be back as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Drew</strong>: Just a comment. I know the record in exhibition games hasn't inspired much confidence in the coming season, but I think it is only fair to point out that if they play at last year's winning percentage, they would be on pace to win 25 or 26 games. I think it comes out to 25.6. Also, as you pointed out, the Blue Jays did finish two games below the Pirates' record last year...yes, they have some of the games most highly touted prospects, but even those guys with great blood lines still have to prove it on the field. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Agree, Drew. On everything. The Pirates are certainly flawed, but I don't think they're a nine-win club. And everybody makes the Blue Jays out to be so much better. They might have more talent in the system right now, but it has not yet come to fruition.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: Besides Burdi, who amongst the pen guys has looked the most crisp overall so far? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Umm ... Crick's stuff has looked good, but the velocity has been a little down. Most crisp ... tough one. This is gonna sound strange, but Clay Holmes has been pretty solid thus far. I've liked what I've seen out of him. Maybe Feliz, too, although again, the results the other night was bad.</p>
<p><strong>Huge Pirates Fan</strong>: I think the pirates need to sell the farm for a big name guy to bring people back to the seats. Stadium looks pretty much empty these days. I was thinking a guy like Mike Moustakous or Christian Yelich. Possibly Jacob Toblerone. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You want them to "sell the farm" for Christian Yelich, who a couple months ago signed a massive extension to stay in Milwaukee? Gotta hope this is some sort of joke.</p>
<p><strong>PhillyJake</strong>: I just asked you this on twitter - how many are left in camp now? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Believe their (PNC PARK) 40 looks like this: Pitchers (17): Brault, Brubaker, Burdi, Crick, Erlin, Feliz, Holland, Holmes, Keller, Kuhl, Musgrove, Neverauskas, Rodriguez, Stratton, Taillon, Turley, Williams<br> <br> Catchers (3): Stallings, Murphy, Susac<br> <br> Infielders (9): Bell, Evans, Frazier, Gonzalez, Moran, Newman, Osuna, Riddle, Tucker<br> <br> Outfielders (4): Brito, Dyson, Heredia, Reynolds<br> <br> COVID/undisclosed: Kela, Cederlind, Polanco</p>
<p><strong>Ron T.</strong>: Is it me or do the Pirates have a history of keeping their younger prospects in the minors longer than other teams? If so, do you think this tendency will change with the new GM and manager? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know if you can make a determination any which way. They've been accused of manipulating Super 2 status, and I think some of that is fair. But I also think they jumped Polanco to the major leagues a little too earlier. I think I'd feel more comfortable saying they made the wrong development call too often in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Sunner in the sunshine</strong>: Hi Jason and thanks for the chats! After watching the Indians game the other night with Rich Rod and Feliz giving up homers, it seemed like a repeat of last year's nightmare. The relievers once thought as a plus are now a huge minus in my book especially with those 2 giving up gopher balls on a regular basis. Any young guys in the organization that can come in and save the Pirate's sinking ship? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It's. Been. Two. Games. And in this case, one. Give it time.</p>
<p><strong>Brenda</strong>: Jason, I enjoy the chats. How do baseball teams determine if there is a need for captain? I know hockey and football teams have them. Is it history/traditional? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They don't really. It's not the same as hockey. There might be one, like Jason Varitek or Derek Jeter. But I think a lot of those times it's situations where you don't have to wonder.</p>
<p><strong>PhillyJake</strong>: No news from the Zoom call ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: None. Sorry. It was Mitch Keller, who is a much better pitcher than talker.</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: Which of the current Altoona pitchers due you see near the front of line to be recalled? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: If something happens, probably James Marvel. He's done it before. Maybe Miguel Del Pozo, too. I'm also interested to see what Cody Bolton looks like.</p>
<p><strong>Tony</strong>: During the intra-squad game that was televised I noticed the Pirates utilizing the shift. Do you think they were just practicing fielding the shift...and not sending a signal on how to defend their own hitters? Or am I looking too much into it <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They use shifts a lot, Tony. All teams do. I think you're probably reading a little too much into it.</p>
<p><strong>tmartin8757@yahoo.com</strong>: Hey Janson. Great job running the chat. I read it weekly...What do you think of Phil Evans chance to get a lot of AB's this year? He looks like he knows his way around the diamond!Bucs Fan in GA <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know about "a lot of at-bats," but I do think he will make the team. And I think there's a chance he could grab a bench spot. I really do. He's reliable defensively. Can play everywhere. And if he can hit, he's basically Erik Gonzalez with a better bat. I don't think you need both of those guys, and if Evans provides some pop, I think that could help him nail down a job.</p>
<p><strong>Too Tall 21</strong>: Over the last couple seasons, it seemed like the bullpen guys threw more balls than strikes and when they did hit the zone, the ball hit the outfield seats. I really thought the new coaching staff was going to fix this. Wow, it sure doesn’t look like anything has changed. I wouldn’t normally worry about something like this after 2 games but the recent history says we should worry. Any chance before Friday you’ll get Marin to comment on what’s happened so far? Thanks, Jason <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think Marin will be talking in the next couple days, but I can tell you this: He's not coaching these guys to throw balls. Also, it's been two games. I don't know why there seems to be such an uproar over two games -- maybe the lack of live sports over the past four months? -- but we knew relievers would be behind. Can't replicate that sort of experience. And they pitched like crap for two games. It can still change and turn around.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Is it just me, or is having coaches pitch and pitchers play center going to get the team ready at all for games? Are other teams doing this? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yes. It's baseball, not Navy SEAL training. I think it's OK if they laugh a little bit. And I don't think the Pirates automatically stink because they let a couple of pitchers play center field. They'll stink if they can't hit, pitch or field, and if they struggle with those things, criticize away.</p>
<p><strong>Jim M.</strong>: Jason, Dyson is said to be an upgrade defensively but how much patience will the Pirates have if he hits in the low .200s? I’d rather see Heradia, Oliva (Cole Tucker when he’s ready). <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think it depends, Jim. Probably on the rest of their offense, and if other guys can make up for it. Maybe how they're losing games, too. And what sort of a center field he's playing. If he's truly incredible, you can live with the lack of hitting, but it's a balance, right? I have no desire to see Heredia unless somebody is getting a day off. Oliva and Tucker, sure. But I'm not convinced either is ready for regular work at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: The pirates should sign Yasiel Puig. We don’t know when polanco will be back so we could use a right fielder and we have a perfect candidate here <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I know, Ricky. Sooner or later they'll realize. They got a second chance, too, and still couldn't take it.</p>
<p><strong>Mason Jackey</strong>: Have any pirates looked stronger coming back to summer camp this year <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Not noticeably. Although it's tough because we're not allowed anywhere near them. Moran has shown some decent power, although I can't see he looks noticeably more muscular.</p>
<p><strong>Vince</strong>: What’s the latest plan for Tucker and Hayes? Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They sent Hayes to Altoona. He'll get work and back up to speed. I still think they will give him a shot in Pittsburgh at some point, depending on what Moran does at the position. And I think you're going to see them spot Tucker in as he can handle it. They don't wanna rush him and screw this up. Let him learn a little bit and put him in a position to succeed. But I think he might get the odd start here and there once he's ready. Could also be a bat off the bench or play some infield, too.</p>
<p><strong>Troy</strong>: Hi Jason, do the coaches feel Bell’s defensive abilities have improved? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They do, Troy. Now, the true test will be games, obviously. But so far Bell has looked better, though the throwing -- as you will soon see -- definitely looks different.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: Any indication on when Polanco might return? When exactly did his test come back positive? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: We don't know on the second part, Danny. MLB protocols prevent them from giving us any detail on this. Have been hearing he's expected back soon, but nothing more than that. And although nothing super concrete. Saw on Instagram he's throwing in his apartment.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Were Erlin and Murphy contracts actually selected? I just found it weird that teams were reporting based on transaction log and not simply reporting. Heck, log doesn't even say Murphy was selected, but assigned. Does not being in the park have something to do with that? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know what you're referencing, Josh, but Shelton was asked yesterday about those contracts being selected and answered the question. In baseball there's a lot of information that's passed around between the team and beat writers -- I guess because there's so much of it -- that sometimes take time to show up on logs and things of that nature.</p>
<p><strong>Too Tall 21</strong>: Jason, you seem down on Heredia. Based on 2 games (😄) I’ve been impressed. Looked very good in right on several occasions and pretty good at the plate as well. Coaches have been complementary, as well. What are you seeing? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I'm seeing a guy who is a little older, hasn't hit for a ton fo power and hasn't been overly impressive since the start of spring training. He hasn't been awful by any stretch. He's a good fourth outfielder. It's what it is. But I wouldn't be overly committed him 1. At the expense of my young kids and 2. Over Dyson, who's a much better fielder.</p>
<p><strong>tmartin8757@yahoo.com</strong>: I'm willing to give the Bucs some time. Gee, it is only 2 games. But I do like what I saw of Musgrove, Brault and Kuhn. Curious to see what Holland will do today. If he and Keller have good year's... That would be very encouraging...The relievers are on a short lease but I think they are better than what they are showing. Beat'em Bucs...Bucs Fan in GA <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thanks for the comments. Also curious on Holland. And I do think the starting rotation has the potentially to be much better than it was last year. Believe it was last week or the week before that I went on my rant, but they're prepared much differently this season, trust me.</p>
<p><strong>Stan</strong>: Who do you see as being best suited for the dh and closer roles? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Closer, at this point, probably Burdi, although I expect Kela back relatively soon. DH will be a rotation. Maybe Polanco some. Use Moran there and play Osuna or Evans at third, eventually Hayes. Bell to give him a break. It won't be one guy.</p>
<p><strong>Sunner in the sunshine</strong>: I know its only 2 games Jason but we are 2 days away from real baseball and starting out 0-5 because the bullpen blows up would be cause for alarm right off the bat. I see the same thing with the relievers chucking the ball down Broadway at the letters for the easy bat on ball connection for a round tripper. Are there possibilities other than Feliz and Rodriguez? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: This plus 0-5, in my opinion, would be a fair time to get worried. But not before 0-5. And, no, there really aren't. I mean, there's Crick, Burdi and eventually/hopefully Kela. But those are your back-end guys. I supposed Holmes could maybe be that, but that's a reach right now. Erlin is a specialist. Stratton is a better long man. Dovy? Turley has been decent. I like Cederlind, but the latter has been missing, and Turley doesn't have a great track record.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: One of my favorite elements of this season is to see how we handle the trade deadline. Kela should be one of the more intriguing trade chips if/when he returns, but could you imagine if we were contending?? Cherington would have some tough decisions to make about getting better without hurting the future. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I still think they would trade whomever. I think their goal here is to set themselves up for the future. Contending or not, the deadline makes all the sense in the world to trade Kela and Frazier, as much as I like both. Would've put Archer in that category, too, before he got hurt.</p>
