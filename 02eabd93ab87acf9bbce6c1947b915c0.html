<h1>Robert Morris, Andy Toole agree to contract extension</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Robert Morris and men’s basketball coach Andy Toole have agreed to a contract extension that will keep the 39-year-old in charge of the program through the 2025-26 season, sources told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>Toole has a 188-154 record since becoming head coach in 2010, and the Colonials program is currently on an upswing.&nbsp;The team won the Northeast Conference tournament at its new UPMC Events Center last season though, its trip to the NCAA tournament was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Toole, the NEC coach of the year in 2014, also won two regular-season conference titles in 2013 and 2014 and a conference tournament championship in 2015. That season, Robert Morris advanced out of the NCAA tournament’s First Four in Dayton by beating North Florida before losing to No. 1 seed Duke.</p>
<p>The competition going forward will get tougher for Toole and Robert Morris as they head to the Horizon League for the upcoming season. Toole is well-respected in coaching circles, so locking him down ahead of the step up in conference competition is a wise move for Robert Morris.</p>
<p>CBS Sports first reported Toole’s extension.</p>
