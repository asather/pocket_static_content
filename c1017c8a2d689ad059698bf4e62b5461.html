<h1>Baldwin shuts down football, girls soccer because of COVID-19 cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The football and girls soccer teams at Baldwin High School have been shut down for 14 days because of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Randal Lutz, superintendent of the Baldwin-Whitehall School District, said in a release Thursday that a member of the football coaching staff tested positive for COVID-19. The team has been shut down for two weeks and players and coaches are in quarantine. The team can’t practice and Baldwin postponed games against North Allegheny Friday and Canon-McMillan on Sept. 25.</p>
<p>Both of the postponed games were Quad County West Conference contests that could affect playoff qualifiers. The WPIAL has said that games postponed because of COVID-19 reasons are “no contests,” but schools should attempt to re-schedule.</p>
<p>Other games in the WPIAL this season have been postponed because of COVID-19 reasons and the postponements could create a mess for the WPIAL. For Baldwin, re-scheduling would mean the Highlanders would have to play four games in about two weeks. Plus, Baldwin still has to try to make up the conference opener against Mt. Lebanon originally scheduled for Sept. 11. That contest was postponed because of a COVID-19 case at Mt. Lebanon.</p>
<p>“We will reach out to the WPIAL and see what the options are moving forward,” Baldwin athletic director John Saras said.</p>
<p>The WPIAL has said it will decide in late September or early October what to do with postponed games. The PIAA ruled earlier this summer that any postseason game canceled by a team for COVID-19 reasons is a forfeit.</p>
<p>Baldwin, under first-year coach Tim Sweeney, beat Hollidaysburg last Friday in a non-conference game.</p>
<p>The Baldwin girls soccer team has to postpone four games. Baldwin would not say whether the COVID-19 case dealt with a player or coach.</p>
