<h1>Allegheny County ordered four establishments closed in last week for violations, one reopens</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department has closed four establishments in the last week, citing health violations.</p>
<p>Oddballs at 1505 East Carson St. in the South Side was ordered closed on Sept. 5 due to allowing indoor operations after 11 p.m.; exceeding 25% indoor occupancy; serving alcoholic beverages without meals; lack of face coverings; and failure to maintain physical distancing between patrons.</p>
<p>Oddballs must remain closed for a minimum of a week and a COVID-19 safety plan must be submitted prior to requesting a re-inspection and permission to reopen, according to the health department.</p>
<p>A call to the business went unanswered.</p>
<p>Nerdz/The Garage at&nbsp;1902 Brownsville Road in&nbsp;Carrick was ordered closed on Sept. 5 due to several violations, including operating without a valid health permit;&nbsp;allowing indoor operations after 11 p.m.; facility operating as a nightclub; lack of face coverings; exceeding 25% indoor occupancy; and failure to maintain physical distancing between patrons.</p>
<p>Owner William Bagley said he’s confused why he is being cited since Nerdz is a computer-repair business.&nbsp;“I would like to know how the health department has jurisdiction over me. We fix computers and smartphones,” Mr. Bagley said.</p>
<p>Time Capsule at 38 Mt. Oliver St. in Allentown was ordered closed on Sept. 5 for several violations, including operating without a valid health permit; allowing indoor operations after 11 p.m.; facility operating as a nightclub; lack of face coverings; and exceeding 25% indoor occupancy.</p>
<p>The health department noted that inspectors were denied entry but observations were made from the entrance. The facility was observed admitting patrons with a cover charge, according to the report. A phone number was not available.</p>
<p>Roundz Lounge at 1814 S. Braddock Ave. in Swissvale was ordered closed on Sept. 2 due to several violations including inadequate refrigeration; evidence of smoking behind the bar; failure to wash, rinse and sanitize kitchenware; sewage on the floor in the customer area; and lack of hand soap at the hand sink. The facility was also cited for lack of face coverings for employees.</p>
<p>The facility was reinspected on Sept. 8 and has since reopened.&nbsp;</p>
