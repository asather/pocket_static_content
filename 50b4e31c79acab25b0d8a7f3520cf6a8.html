<h1>URA approves fund to help with utility, mortgage payments in face of COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Starting Monday low-to-moderate-income Pittsburghers experiencing economic hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will be able to apply for utility and mortgage payment assistance.</p>
<p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority board unanimously approved the COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Fund Thursday.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;“really critical action” is&nbsp;“probably one of many to come,” said Sam Williamson, board chair.</p>
<p>The short-term assistance will be in amounts of $3,000 for residents struggling to pay rent or utilities and who are at 50% or below the area’s annual media income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s $39,950 for a family of four, according to 2019 federal standards.</p>
<p>Homeowners at 80% AMI may be eligible for $3,000 in assistance for mortgage payments, including late fees.</p>
<p>That’s $63,900 for a family of four.</p>
<p>Residents can call the Urban League of Pittsburgh at&nbsp;412-227-4163 starting on March 23 to find out if they qualify.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Urban League will administer the fund that is being established with $300,000 from the city’s Housing Opportunity Fund.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to continue to evaluate what the need is and be flexible about making sure we’re putting together programs that meet the needs of people in Pittsburgh,” Mr. Williamson said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the authority announced interest-free loan opportunities up to $15,000 for its current small business borrowers, according to a press release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Business owners should email tlink@ura.org or jwilhelm@ura.org to see if they’re eligible.</p>
<p>In other business, the URA board unanimously approved additional financing and deed of sale for the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2020/01/15/Vote-nears-first-phase-New-Granada-Square-redevelopment-Hill-District-pittsburgh/stories/202001140139" target="_blank">New Granada Theater development in the Hill District</a> as well as an option agreement for possible “conveyance of URA parcels” for the Millcraft <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2018/09/13/Esplanade-North-Side-Ohio-River-Pittsburgh-Chateau-Millcraft-Investments-Ferris-Wheel/stories/201809130179" target="_blank">development</a> in the Chateau area of the North Side, which is in&nbsp;“very early” stages, according to the board.</p>
