<h1>Pat Narduzzi's pay increased to $4.07 million during the 2019 fiscal year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the third time in as many years, Pat Narduzzi stands as Pitt’s highest-paid employee, earning&nbsp;$4.07 million&nbsp;during the 2019 fiscal year, according to tax documents made public by the school Friday.</p>
<p>That figure stands as a nearly 27% increase from the $3.21 million he made during the 2018 fiscal year and is 123% more than the $1.83 million he earned during the 2016 fiscal year, his first at the school. In the past year, Narduzzi’s base compensation increased from $1.99 million to $2.95 million while his bonus and incentive compensation decreased slightly, from $1.15 million to $1.03 million. His reportable compensation from the school in the most recent fiscal year was $4.02 million, with an additional $52,223 coming from estimated compensation from the school and related organizations.</p>
<p>The salaries in the document come from a period running from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019.</p>
<p>During that stretch, the first time that he was at the university the entirety of a fiscal year, men’s basketball coach Jeff Capel earned $2.66 million, making him Pitt’s second-highest-paid employee, behind only Narduzzi. Capel’s reportable compensation from the school was $2.63 million, along with $36,036 in estimated compensation from the university and related organizations.</p>
<p>Numbers reported on IRS 990 forms do not always reflect the total money brought in by the listed individuals, as coaches in the major-revenue sports often receive income from additional sources.</p>
<p>When only considering money the coaches receive from their respective schools, Narduzzi’s salary from that time would rank him 27th among college football coaches nationally and third among his ACC counterparts, according to a USA Today database, behind only Clemson’s Dabo Swinney and Florida State’s Willie Taggart, the latter of whom was fired in November.</p>
<p>Capel’s salary would place him 38th&nbsp;nationally and seventh in the ACC. His earnings also top the $2.49 million his predecessor, Kevin Stallings, made in his final year with the Panthers.</p>
<p>Stallings, however, still stands as Pitt’s third-highest-paid non-officer, having been paid $2.54 million&nbsp;during the 2019 fiscal year. That period began nearly four months after he was fired by the university in March 2018, after two years and a 24-41 record. Stallings and the university reached a resolution on the termination of his contract in March 2018 after it previously tried to fire him for cause and avoid a full buyout payment believed to be more than $9 million. Terms of that deal were never revealed.</p>
<p>Stallings isn’t the only fired Pitt coach to appear among the school’s highest earners. Former women’s basketball coach Suzie McConnell-Serio, who was fired in April 2018, made $2.15 million,&nbsp;placing her as the fourth highest-paid non-officer. Like Stallings, terms of her buyout were never disclosed.</p>
<p>Other members of the athletic department to appear among Pitt’s highest-paid employees were athletic director Heather Lyke ($710,000), football defensive coordinator Randy Bates ($497,282) and former offensive coordinator Shawn Watson ($495,833), the last of whom was fired in Jan. 2019.</p>
<p>Unlike many large public research universities nationally, Pitt is a “state-related institution,” meaning it is not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests that could produce contracts and salaries for coaches, administrators and other individuals at the school. Penn State, Temple and Lincoln have the same designation, though as non-profit institutions, all four are required to file 990 forms annually to the IRS.</p>
