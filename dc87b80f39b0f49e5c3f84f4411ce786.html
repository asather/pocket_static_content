<h1>PPG to buy Chicago coatings maker </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PPG is adding a Chicago powder coatings maker to its portfolio.</p>
<p>The Downtown-based paints giant Wednesday said it has a deal to acquire Alpha Coating Technologies, which manufactures powder coatings for machinery, household items and light industrial applications.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed; the deal is expected to close by March.</p>
<p>Alpha was founded in 2000 and employs 35 people.</p>
<p>The deal is part of PPGâ€™s ongoing strategy to grow through acquisitions.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it said it closed on the purchase of Italian coatings producer Industria Chimica Reggiana which makes automotive refinish and light industrial paints.</p>
<p>ICC has about 180 employees.</p>
<p>Last year, PPG spent $700 million on acquisitions.</p>
<p>On an earnings call with Wall Street analysts last month, company Chairman Michael McGarry said he hoped to complete at least four or five deals in 2020.</p>
<p>The company said recent acquisitions accounted for $500 million of total sales of $15.1 billion in 2019.</p>
