<h1>UPMC testing, but still no positive COVID-19 tests</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>UPMC officials said Monday that while they have tested patients for COVID-19 over the last six days, none has yet tested positive.</p>
<p>However, Pittsburgh-based UPMC, which now owns hospitals in New York and Maryland, as well as hospitals in central Pennsylvania, would not say where those tests occurred — either by state or region — or why they were performed.</p>
<p>“We are not going to identify any patients suspected of COVID-19, or their location, to protect their identity,” Dr. Graham Snyder, UPMC’s medical director of infection prevention, said during a press conference Monday.</p>
<p>Allegheny Health Network and Excela Health both said Monday that they have also tested patients for COVID-19 recently. The Veterans Affairs Healthcare System of Pittsburgh said it has not had any cases of COVID-19, but it would not say if it has tested for COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Snyder said doctors could have ordered a test at UPMC because a patient either traveled to an affected area, had exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19, or if the doctor determined the patient needed a test because of a fever or respiratory illness “without an alternative cause.”</p>
<p>He said UPMC won’t divulge the reason for testing because it is following the lead of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health.</p>
<p>Though President Donald Trump said again on Saturday that “anyone who wants to get a test can get a test,” Dr. Snyder said that is not the national public health policy yet.</p>
<p>“The CDC guidance [<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html" target="_blank">which was just updated Monday</a>] doesn’t exactly say anybody who wants to get tested should get tested,” Dr. Snyder said. “The CDC and our public health colleagues are still telling us to focus on what’s likely to be happening with this patient.”</p>
<p>“So far we are seeing very few if any cases in which somebody did not have one of those exposures” of either travel to an affected area or exposure to someone with confirmed COVID-19, he said.</p>
<p>“We want to test patients who are most likely to have COVID-19 rather than test everybody. Because right now in the United States and in our region, it’s unlikely that you have COVID-19 if you have not had one of those exposures.”</p>
<p>One of the reasons that public health officials are still encouraging limited testing —&nbsp;particularly in areas like Pittsburgh which has yet to have any confirmed COVID-19 cases —&nbsp;is that there still does not appear to be the kind of six-figure capacity at laboratories to handle such an onslaught.</p>
<p>The CDC said Monday that national capacity now is just 75,000 total tests. And the Pennsylvania Department of Health has said its state lab capacity will soon be just 125 to 150 tests per day.</p>
<p>Though state testing is limited, state Department of Health spokesman Nate Wardle said Monday in an emailed reply to questions that the state has “no backlogs.”</p>
<p>“The number of requests have not exceeded our capacity,” he added.</p>
<p>Dr. Alan Wells, medical director of UPMC clinical laboratories, said at that health system’s press conference that UPMC is “working very quickly” to design its own test based on the CDC test that the state lab is now using.</p>
<p>UPMC currently sends its COVID-19 tests to the state lab in Exton, Chester County.</p>
<p>“But delivering specimens to the state authority takes time and their capacity is limited for testing,” he said. “By developing our own test, we are seeking to shorten the time it takes and allow for testing from suspected cases to diagnose.”</p>
<p>He said he hopes UPMC can have its own in-house test up and running for all of its facilities within two weeks.</p>
<p>In addition, he said the Pittsburgh health system is trying to leverage its long-standing relationship with Quest Diagnostics, one of the nation’s largest private testing laboratories, to get access to an in-house test being developed for some of its locations.</p>
<p>“But testing [with Quest] will take days,” he said, “and we expect these locations to be stretched to capacity.”</p>
