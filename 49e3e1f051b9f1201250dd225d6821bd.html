<p>Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald is urging the state to forgo in-person voting in the June 2 primary election and have voters submit mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald, citing a recommendation from county Health Department director Dr. Debra Bogen, is asking the state to expand its emergency declaration order to allow the county to send ballots to voters in lieu of in-person voting.</p>
<p>“Holding an in-person election in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic would be, in and of itself, a disaster,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “We are not going to have enough staff to work the election and asking elected and appointed poll workers to work flies in the face of what we’ve been asking everyone in this county to do.”</p>
<p>Also, he noted, in-person voting could jeopardize the health of voters, especially those most vulnerable to getting infected, and “potentially disenfranchise voters who would be afraid to come to the polls.”</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf has ordered people to stay at home and ordered non-life-sustaining businesses closed at least through the end of the month. People should only go outdoors for exercise or to get food and supplies, state officials said.</p>
<p>More than 870 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 21 deaths from the virus have been reported in Allegheny County, according to figures released Monday. Health officials said, however, that limited testing means there are many more positive cases in the county.</p>
<p>Ever since the Pennsylvania Legislature postponed the state’s primary election until June 2, state and local officials have advised voters to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/vote2020/2020/04/08/pennsylvania-mail-in-ballot-application-process-voting-primary-election-covid-19/stories/202004080132" target="_blank">apply for mail-in ballots</a> if they feel uncertain about voting in person.</p>
<p>Any registered voter right now has until May 26 at 5 p.m. to apply for a mail-in ballot. Unlike traditional absentee ballots, you aren’t required to list an excuse for why you want to vote in this manner.&nbsp;You can apply online by visiting <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Mail-and-Absentee-Ballot.aspx" target="_blank">VotesPa.com/ApplyMailBallot</a> and fill out the online form.</p>
