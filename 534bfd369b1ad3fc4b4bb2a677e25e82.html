<p>A Westmoreland jury on Thursday found a woman accused of hiding a murder weapon in the 2017 shooting death of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/westmoreland/2017/11/22/Hundreds-expected-tslain-police-officer-funeral-procession-new-kensington-brian-shaw/stories/201711220136" target="_blank">New Kensington police Officer Brian Shaw</a> guilty on all counts.</p>
<p>Lisa Harrington, 33, was found guilty on six charges: four hindering apprehension charges; tampering with evidence, and carrying a firearm without a license.&nbsp;Harrington’s $175,000 bond was revoked and she was ordered to jail. A sentencing date has not been set yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“She is devastated,” Harrington’s attorney Adam Gorvelsky said of her reaction to Thursday’s verdict. “She's got kids and she's pregnant. It's a tough one."</p>
<p>Jurors in Westmoreland County Common Pleas Judge Rita Hathaway’s courtroom began deliberations around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, before being sent home around 10 p.m. that night.</p>
<p>Thursday’s verdict ended four days of trial and two in deliberations for the cousin of Rahmael Sal Holt, 31, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/02/12/Official-death-sentence-of-Rahmael-Sal-Holt-finalized-by-Westmoreland-Judge/stories/202002120113" target="_blank">who&nbsp;was sentenced to death in November</a> by a Westmoreland jury who found him guilty the shooting death of Officer Shaw.</p>
<p>The rookie police officer was killed on Nov. 17, 2017, after attempting to pull over a Jeep driven by Tavon Harper. Holt was a passenger in the car, and jurors determined that the Harrison native jumped from the vehicle and shot Officer Shaw during a foot chase through a dark lot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A murder weapon was never found.</p>
<p>Since the start of the trial on Monday, prosecutors brought forth about seven witnesses, Mr. Gorvelsky said. Those testifying included Michael Luffey, Holly Clemons and&nbsp;Antionette Strong, who previously lived at a home with Holt on Victoria Avenue. Each gave varying accounts and said they witnessed Lisa Harrington go into the basement of the home sometime after the shooting and leave carrying a purse, while another said they saw her carrying a&nbsp;“brown paper bag.”</p>
<p>Harrington and her mother were the only witnesses defense brought forth who testified Wednesday. Harrington contested claims that she hid any weapon, Mr. Gorvelsky said.</p>
<p>In a criminal complaint, Detective Ray Dupilka with the Westmoreland County District Attorney’s Office accused Harrington of removing a .40-caliber pistol from a house on Victoria Avenue, hiding it on her, driving it away and “concealing its existence from law enforcement investigators” following the fatal shooting in 2017.</p>
<p>Within moments of the shooting, Lakita Cain — the mother of Holt’s girlfriend — told police that Holt came into her house on nearby Victoria Avenue and asked to use her phone, according to the complaint against Harrington.</p>
<p>Cain told police that Holt went into the basement and spoke several times on the phone before leaving. Police came by her house several times after the shooting, but she lied and didn’t tell them that Holt had come by right after she had heard gunshots, the complaint said.</p>
<p>The next day, Nov. 18, 2017, Harrington came to the house “at Holt’s direction,” according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Cain told investigators that Harrington said, “ ‘I think it’s here,’ referring to what Cain believed to be the gun used to kill Officer Shaw,” the complaint said.</p>
<p>Harrington went to the basement and then came back up, stating, “ ‘It’s taken care of,’ “ before driving off, the complaint said.</p>
