<h1>Us: SloppyMatt's review of Yelp: a right and a useful app </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Each of us has a story. This one made our website. To suggest someone for the Us column, which runs every Monday, email uscolumn@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p>People in these United States not only have exercised but fully exercised their constitutional right to yelp — that&nbsp;short, sharp cry of pain or alarm.</p>
<p>Americans truly love yelping, which is also what your dog does if you accidentally step on its tail. America has red and blue yelpers, fake and true yelpers, wonderfully old and pleasantly new yelpers.</p>
<p>Matthew Uchaker, 39, has taken that right to heart. He writes business and restaurant reviews for the crowd-sourced app and website known as Yelp — yes, that Yelp —&nbsp;which got 250 million hits in the first-quarter of 2020, despite the pandemic.</p>
<p>To date he has posted 2,105 reviews — more than any other Yelp Elite member in the region. Presenting mostly positive reviews, he recounts experiences he has had at restaurants, stores, parks, businesses and even on tunnels and bridges.</p>
<p>That means “SloppyMatt” (his handle) generates more Yelps than a wobbly drunk stumbling through a dog kennel with size 15s.</p>
<p>The Johnstown, Pa., resident makes a 1½- to two-hour daily commute to his nursing aide job at the Pittsburgh VA Medical Center in Oakland, with many stops along the way for food and gasoline.&nbsp;His most recent review involved a trio dish from Mohan’s Restaurant in Penn Hills, with lasagna “as good as lasagna could be,” spaghetti you&nbsp;“can wrap around a fork,” and chicken Parmesan whose sauce and cheese trapped “any flavor that thought it was going to get away.”</p>
<p>He topped it all off with a drool about the garlic bread: “My [G]od. No vampire was going to get near me after eating that. I love garlic and this definitely satisfied my need for garlic for a while.”</p>
<p>He recently “Yelped” about the risks and rewards of patronizing Plum Convenience, Walgreens in Penn Hills, Little Auto Sales and Beverage in Johnstown and the Uni-Mart in New Florence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It all began in 2012, when he&nbsp;vented on Facebook about a disappointing family dinner at a chain restaurant in Altoona, prompting a friend to suggest Yelp. He was off and typing — a hobby turned obsession turned civic duty to help people find what’s welcoming and avoid what’s not.</p>
<p>In 2016, he entertainingly reviewed the Squirrel Hill Tunnel.&nbsp;Let’s say that Pittsburgh “was a hot establishment that you wanted to visit,” he wrote, describing the Parkway East as “the red carpeted line” that’s supposed to guide you to that hot establishment. “By those correlations we can say that the Squirrel Hill Tunnel is that bouncer that stands between you and your destination.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>He rips that hillside a new hole, or so we wish, given that the tunnel “does not care that you need to get in, that you know somebody on the other side is waiting for you, or that you work here.” No heart, no empathy, no sympathy. Egad, he blurts, “the tunnel is a monster.”</p>
<p>Ain’t driving through that there tunnel no more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>About 650 of his reviews focus on Pittsburgh, but he has also done them nationwide and in London and Paris. His reviews serve as a travelogue of his experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It takes time, and I think about the reviews I do,” he said.</p>
<p>“This is a hobby for me and everyone needs a hobby. But I also like sharing my world with whoever is reading these. I’m not a persuasive person. I just view it as it is and give the business a try.”</p>
<p>Rachel Carlson, 38, of Mt. Lebanon, is the Pittsburgh Yelp community director with 1,324 reviews. She fully appreciates Matt’s accomplishments as the region’s most prolific Elite Yelp reviewer.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I start writing a review in my head as soon as I walk into a place, noting the ambiance and how I was greeted,” she said. “That’s how my mind thinks now.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Yelp prefers sharing good experiences, with 77% of all reviews receiving three, four or five stars, she said.</p>
<p>In Downtown Pittsburgh, Meat &amp; Potatoes restaurant has received a regional high of 2,023 reviews, followed by&nbsp;Gaucho Parrilla Argentina with 1,981. The Squirrel Hill Tunnel has only nine reviews and a two-star rating, while the Fort Pitt Tunnel (25 reviews) boasts four stars.</p>
<p>So if a place of business, landmark or tunnel steps on your tail, you have every right to yelp.</p>
<p>But Matt knows, given the many thousands of reads he gets each quarter, you really have to Yelp if you want the world to hear it.&nbsp;</p>
