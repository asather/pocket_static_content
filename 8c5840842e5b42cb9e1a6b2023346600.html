<p>MILWAUKEE — Before their game Sunday against the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park, the Pirates placed outfield Bryan Reynolds on the paternity list and recalled infielder Will Craig.</p>
<p>Reynolds’ wife, Blair, had been pregnant with the couple’s first child, a boy due in September, and manager Derek Shelton said Reynolds got the call around 5 a.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>“He’s en route back right now," Shelton said, "so hopefully he gets there in time.”</p>
<p>While major league teams have been trying to limit commercial travel, for a situation like this, it's sort of unavoidable, the manager said.</p>
<p>"When you’re dealing with kids and being there for a moment of your life, we have to be a little more lenient in allowing him," Shelton said. "We’d like him to get there for the birth. Then we’ll just protocol him back in when we come back.”</p>
<p>Without Reynolds, Adam Frazier received another start in left field. Frazier played his first game there since 2018 on Friday.</p>
<p>Craig was sent to Altoona Saturday when the Pirates activated pitchers Carson Fulmer and Kyle Crick. Craig made his MLB debut last week in St. Louis.</p>
<p>The time off probably comes at a good time for Reynolds, who was in a 1-for-21 slump that dropped his batting average to .184.</p>
