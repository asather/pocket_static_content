<h1>Best Pittsburgh concerts this week: Grace Potter, The Tubes, The Adicts, Umphrey's McGee</h1>

<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grace Potter:</strong> The roots-rocker possessing some of the most powerful pipes in the business pulls into the Roxian, McKees Rocks, touring behind her first record in four years, “Daylight.” The emotionally charged album came in the wake of the breakup of her band (the Nocturnals), a divorce, a remarriage and the birth of a child. Devon Gilfillian opens the show at 8 p.m. Tickets are $32.50; roxianlive.com.</p>

<p><strong>The Tubes:</strong> The Bay Area glam band hits Jergel’s, Marshall, on a tour that finds them playing 1981’s “The Completion Backward Principle” — with “Don’t Want to Wait Anymore” and “Talk to Ya Later” — in its entirety. Expect to also hear classics like the audacious 1975 single “White Punks on Dope” and the 1983 hit “She’s a Beauty.” The flamboyant Fee Waybill leads the band which also features longtime members Roger Steen, Prairie Prince and Rick Anderson. 8 p.m. $32 advance; $35 day of show; jergels.com.</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adicts:</strong> The British punks that copped the Clockwork Orange “droog” look back in the ’70s, spend a night in McKees Rocks at the Roxian. The band, which released their debut album, “Songs of Praise,” in 1981 and are best known for the singles “Bad Boys” and “‘Viva La Revolution,” are still fronted by Keith “Monkey” Warren along with the Davison brothers on guitar and drums. Also on the bill are Ravagers and The Droogettes. It begins at 8 p.m. Tickets are $23; roxianlive.com.</p>

<p><strong>Umphrey’s McGee:</strong>&nbsp;This plentiful period for jam-band fans continues another Bonnaroo staple. Umphrey’s McGee, formed at Notre Dame in 1997, returns to Stage AE with a pair of sets that will blow through every style imaginable. Their latest releases were 2018’s “It’s Not Us” and “It’s You.” With The New Deal. Doors at 6 p.m. $20-$35; ticketmaster.com.</p>
<p><strong>Led Zeppelin 2:</strong>&nbsp;This is a case of 2 plays “III.” The Chicago-based tribute band marks the 50th anniversary of Led Zeppelin “III” by playing the 1970 album in full. “III” marked a shift for the British icons by balancing hard rock crunch (“Immigrant Song,” “Out on the Tiles”) and metal blues (“Since I’ve Been Loving You”) with new adventures into acoustic folk on songs like “Gallows Pole” and “Tangerine.” 8 p.m. $25; ticketmaster.com.</p>
<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nightly:</strong> The moody Nashville alt-pop band that was on the road in 2018 with NF play an all-ages show at the Thunderbird Cafe &amp; Music Hall with THE WLDLFE and Sawyer. 6:30 p.m. $12; roxianlive.com.</p>
