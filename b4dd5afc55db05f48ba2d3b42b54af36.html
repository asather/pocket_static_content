<h1>Pelosi: Business as usual for House after Trump’s positive test </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered no indications Friday of imminent changes to congressional operations after President Donald Trump tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>“The distancing, that’s hard, the distancing because people are trying to communicate about legislation and the rest,” the California Democrat said on MSNBC. “But I do think that the president, the situation with the president then makes it clearer that everybody has to keep their distance on both sides, on both sides of the aisle.”</p>
<p>Ms. Pelosi made clear that message was largely directed at Republicans, whom she said “in most cases mimic what the president says about masks, about distancing and the rest, which is most unfortunate.”</p>
<p>She added: “That’s why we’ve had to institute rules in the chamber in terms of mask wearing being required: ‘You don’t have a mask, you can’t come in; you don’t have a mask, we have one for you.‘”</p>
<p>However, Ms. Pelosi expressed hope that Mr. Trump’s exposure, “with all the protection he has,” might be “a learning experience” that translates into more aggressive action to combat the virus and limit its spread.</p>
<p>“This is tragic. It’s very sad,” she said. “But it also is something that, again, going into crowds unmasked and all the rest was sort of a brazen invitation for something like this to happen. Sad that it did, but nonetheless hopeful that it will be a transition to a saner approach to what this virus is all about.”</p>
<p>She also said she hopes the president recovers: “Hopefully this won’t be so serious for the president, but by dint of age he’s younger than I am, so I can say that ... I’m glad that he will have the best possible care.”</p>
<p>Ms. Pelosi, who as speaker is second in the presidential line of succession, said she has not heard from the White House on continuity of government matters but said military and government officials ensure that is ongoing.</p>
<p>“That continuity of government is always in place,” she said.</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence, first in the line of succession, tested negative for COVID-19 on Friday.</p>
<p>Conducting the interview from the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi noted she was tested Friday morning “out of an abundance of caution” but had not gotten the results yet. The only White House official Ms. Pelosi said she’s been in contact with recently is Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who informed her earlier Friday that he had tested negative for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin met in person on Wednesday to negotiate another COVID-19 aid package, continuing those negotiations over the phone Thursday. Although Mr. Mnuchin was reportedly advised he did not have close enough contact with the president to need to quarantine, further negotiations appear likely to continue over the phone given Ms. Pelosi’s concerns about the accuracy of the rapid tests the White House uses.</p>
<p>“I have concern about the test, because obviously the tests that are happening at the White House are not as accurate as they should be, and that’s a discussion that we have to have, especially when it has led to exposure of the president of the United States,” she said.</p>
