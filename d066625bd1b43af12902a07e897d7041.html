<h1>Pirates players buy lunch for Allegheny General Hospital workers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pirates players long ago left LECOM Park in Bradenton, Fla., but still remain in daily communication through a text message thread.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, the idea was proposed to do something for hospital workers in Pittsburgh, helping those who are helping others during the coronavirus outbreak. They also wanted to support local businesses.</p>
<p>On Monday, those guys, on their own, put a plan into action, buying lunch from two local pizza shops — Slice on Broadway at PNC Park and Pizzeria Davide in the Strip District — for employees at Allegheny General Hospital.</p>
<p>Slice will deliver 300 pizzas to AGH in waves on Monday from 11 a.m.-1 p.m. Pizzeria Davide doesn’t deliver, so Pirates employees will transport 100 pizzas and 10 trays of pasta to the same place.</p>
<p>Precautions have also been taken to ensure social distancing and proper sanitation amid the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>“We aren’t able to be up in Pittsburgh, but we wanted to let hospital workers on the front lines and local businesses that mean so much to our home city know that we’re thinking of them,” said Jameson Taillon, one of the organizers. “It was a no brainer from the players’ side.”</p>
<p>Pirates players not only organized the donation but funded it as well. Taillon, who's Pittsburgh's MLBPA rep, also said they're finalizing plans to donate Commonplace Coffee — Taillon is a huge, huge coffee nut — to some area firehouses.</p>
<p>“Obviously now is a pressing time, but they’re always an important part of our communities,” Taillon said. “We just wanted to let our city know we’re with them through this.”</p>

<p>AT&amp;T SportsNet announced plans on Monday to provide special Penguins and Pirates programming, including the re-airing of several classic games.</p>
<p>Fans can engage with sideline reporters Robby Incmikoski and Dan Potash, as they will live tweet during games using the hashtags #BucsClassic and #PensClassic.</p>
<p>Monday will feature AT&amp;T SportsNet's special "Sidney Crosby: There's No Place Like Home," followed by the Inside Penguins Hockey episode that includes Potash's lunch with Evgeni Malkin.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, AT&amp;T SportsNet will show the 2013 NL wild-card&nbsp;game against the Reds, with Michael McKenry and Garrett Jones live tweeting.</p>
<p>Wednesday will be the Penguins' 50th Anniversary Movie following by Pirates Opening Day from 2011 (at Cubs) — on what would've been Opening Day for the 2020 season.</p>
<p>Next week, on March 30, will be Game 3 of the 2009 Stanley Cup final (Penguins vs. Red Wings), followed by Game 7 of the 1960 World Series (Pirates vs. Yankees) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fans can watch Game 4 of the 2009 Stanley Cup final on April 1 and the Pirates’ 2014 home opener (vs. Cubs) the next night.</p>
