<h1>Restaurants need our help now </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Local restaurants are often the heart and soul of neighborhoods, a place where friends and family gather, a vital piece of the local business community. But because of the coronavirus pandemic, many are teetering on the edge of solvency and may be forced to close their doors for good.</p>
<p>If some financial assistance isn’t approved — at the state or federal level — and more commonsense state guidelines aren’t adopted, thousands of independent restaurants will be shuttered — and that will be a huge loss for the local community and the overall economy.</p>
<p>Of all the businesses adversely affected by the pandemic, perhaps none has had to endure more ever-changing statewide restrictions than the restaurant industry.</p>
<p>Consider what restaurateurs in the Pittsburgh area have had to deal with since March: At the outset, they were ordered to close with only takeout service available; eventually they were allowed to reopen with 50% capacity for indoor dining (outdoor dining allowed and encouraged, if possible); when the number of COVID-19 cases surged a few weeks ago, sales of alcohol were banned, followed shortly by a temporary closing order. When they were allowed to reopen once more, capacity was now limited to 25%.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder so many owners say they don’t see a way to survive under the present conditions.</p>
<p>Owners and industry representatives brought their concerns to the attention of the state House Majority Policy Committee recently to point out the dire situation. Industry officials said that without relief, nearly 7,500 establishments could close, eliminating 200,000 jobs.</p>
<p>What’s needed immediately is for state health officials to relax the 25% capacity limit on indoor dining and at least allow restaurants to return to the 50% capacity mark. One owner said that while the 50% limit was not ideal, his sales had started to rebound to the point where he believed they could survive in the short term; at 25% capacity, few local restaurants can make it.</p>
<p>In addition, state officials need stronger enforcement of the guidelines in place. Many owners have gone to great lengths and spent considerable dollars to make their places safe with social distancing measures, hand-sanitizing stations, mask requirements, etc. If some establishments are not adhering to the rules, and COVID-19 cases are rising because of that, the offending operators should be punished rather than the entire industry.</p>
<p>Most important to the industry’s survival at the moment is financial assistance. Gov. Tom Wolf supports a federal proposal that would target $120 billion for restaurants in the form of grants for operating expenses.</p>
<p>The governor has been quiet, however, on proposals by state House Democrats to provide $100 million in state aid to the restaurant industry, while waiving various license and permit fees.</p>
<p>Restaurants are vitally important to local business districts. State lawmakers should be ready to provide financial assistance and guidelines that promote both safety and economic survival.</p>
