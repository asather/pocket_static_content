<h1>Where Pitt succeeded and failed against Syracuse's famed zone defense</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>SYRACUSE, N.Y.&nbsp;— There’s no secret to what Syracuse does defensively, which is what makes it so effective in the first place.</p>
<p>In some instances, teams will utilize a zone to try to neutralize a hot offense and perhaps throw off its rhythm. It’s the basketball equivalent an off-speed pitch for a hurler who has been throwing nothing but fastballs. For the Orange, the two-three zone is a foundation upon which it has built its program, a defense it has used with lethal efficiency for decades. Teams know exactly what they’re facing when they play Jim Boeheim’s squad, yet year after year after year, it works, befuddling and flustering opponents in the same way.</p>
<p>It’s a challenge Pitt knows well, from head coach Jeff Capel and his staff, who are tasked with crafting a gameplan for Syracuse, to players like junior Terrell Brown, who faced the Orange on Saturday for the sixth time in his career. As Brown said after the Panthers’ 69-61 loss at the Carrier Dome, going against the zone never gets easier. It doesn’t allow for comfort.</p>
<p>Pitt’s ability to pick apart the zone at times and its inability to do so in others helped write the script for its defeat Saturday. In the first half, it largely settled for shots and when it did work it inside, one of the best shot-blocking teams in the country did what it does to so many others. In the second half, the Panthers got more creative and active, using some of the more proven ways to find success against such a scheme.</p>
<p>In the game’s first 2:18, Pitt missed three 3-pointers, all of which were shots for which it settled. In those situations, its three players stationed beyond the arc would pass it between each other, unable to find a player in the high post or closer to the corner. It did little to fool the defense or get it into a vulnerable position, often leaving the Panthers in a spot where they’d heave a shot up if they got a couple of feet of space, as Ryan Murphy tried doing here.</p>

<p>“I thought we were a little bit shell-shocked by the zone, the size and length of it,” Capel said. “It’s hard for us to simulate that in practice, especially in a day and a half.”</p>
<p>Late in the first half and, especially, once the second half began, Pitt found more success. It was helped some by versatile forward Justin Champagnie, who played 18:36 in the second half after logging only 6:49 in the first, but some of its best possessions didn’t even involve the 6-foot-6 freshman.</p>
<p>The Panthers sometimes turned to ball screens from Terrell Brown, which allowed guards like Xavier Johnson to get into the middle of the zone, where he could either shoot or find a teammate in an opportune spot once the Syracuse defense keyed in on him (he shot it on this play).</p>

<p>They utilized some inside-out action, getting Johnson, even without the help of a pick, to get inside the defense and have it converge on him a bit, only to turn around and find an open teammate for a shot (in this case, Trey McGowens, who buried a deep 3).</p>

<p>There were a handful of moments, two of which came in the final five minutes, in which Pitt eschewed the challenges of the zone altogether and just lobbed a pass over it to an open player along the baseline, like here with Champagnie to get within eight with about 4:15 remaining.</p>

<p>“When the ball is moved side to side, the middle and wings stay up,” Champagnie said. “The bigs move up, as well. The whole back side baseline is always open for the lobs. I noticed that.”</p>
<p>That was a strategy the Panthers used quite effectively with Brown in a 65-56 loss to Syracuse last season, a game in which the center had 16 points, three shy of a career high, on eight of 13 shooting. He performed well against the Orange Saturday, finishing with 11 points and making five of his six shots. There were dunks and tip-ins, but he was also able to employ what has become a reliable mid-range jump shot, which comes in especially handy against a team with soft spots in the high post and short corners.</p>

<p>Brown said on Saturday that he could tell when he came in that there had been a focus for Syracuse on him -- namely, that when he enters the game, players on the back line of the zone should be aware of the potential for a lob.</p>
<p>Even with that increased attention, he produced, something he attributes to working on his body in the offseason, allowing him to fight through defenders who anticipate a lob. There’s also the impact of associate head coach Tim O’Toole, with whom Brown works closely and who served two separate stints as an assistant at Syracuse (1992-95 and 2013-14), giving him a good deal of familiarity with how the Orange operate.</p>
<p>“In a game like this, it’s big,” Brown said. “We texted, we worked out, he told me what I needed to work on. When I came out, he gave me pointers. He’s been here. He knows. That’s a big help.”</p>
<p><strong>Syracuse’s blocked shots helped dictate the game’s early goings</strong></p>
<p>A big part of Syracuse’s defensive success in the first half had to do with its ability to block shots. Of Pitt’s first 11 shot attempts, five of them were swatted.</p>
<p>Like the zone, it’s no surprise that Syracuse does that. After Saturday’s win, the Orange ranks 15th among 353 Division I programs in block percentage, swatting about 15 percent of opponents’ 2-point attempts. Though it only had one block for the rest of the game, the disruption that came from those rejections was evident.</p>
<p>The clearest example came with about 8:30 remaining in the first half, with Pitt trailing, 20-9, part of a stretch in which it had just one point over five minutes. Before Syracuse had a chance to set up its zone, Johnson knifed through the defense and had what looked to be an open layup. Perhaps anticipating a contest from a taller, outreaching player, Johnson tossed the ball high off the glass, increasing the difficulty of the shot, and missed.</p>

<p>“It has an effect,” Capel said. “That’s what they do. Historically, that’s what they do. That back line is big. They swarm the ball when you get in there. You have to have confrontations at the rim. We talked about that -- layups and things like that don’t really go. You have to attack. They did a good job of imposing their will early.”</p>
<p><strong>The Carrier Dome continued to be unkind</strong></p>
<p>The Carrier Dome, with more than 35,000 seats, holds the distinction of being the largest arena in college basketball. For Pitt in recent years, it has more closely resembled a house of horrors.</p>
<p>Saturday marked its fourth-consecutive loss at the venue, the previous three of which had come by at least 11 points. More worrisome is what has followed those losses at Syracuse. In both the 2016-17 and 2018-19 seasons, the Panthers entered the matchup in a good position and with valid NCAA tournament aspirations. In the first of those seasons, they were 12-3 and coming off a win against Virginia. In the second, they were 12-5, having just knocked off a ranked Florida State squad. Following those two losses, though, they went a combined 6-26 the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>It’s likely just a coincidence, particularly given the timing of the game early in the conference schedule. The next six weeks, though, will determine whether this team avoids a similar fate.</p>
