<h1>Mt. Lebanon commissioners consider renewing deer management archery program </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Mt. Lebanon Board of Commissioners on Tuesday will consider renewing the municipality’s agreement with Suburban Wildlife Management Solutions LLC for its deer management archery program.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon has contracted with the company for the past two years to cull the deer in the area. If approved, the services would cost Mt. Lebanon $8,000, the same as it was last year.</p>
<p>Municipal assistant manager/​planner Ian McMeans and Jason Brunetti, of Suburban Wildlife Management Solutions, presented information to the board at a July 14 virtual meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. McMeans said in 2013, Mt. Lebanon began tracking deer/​vehicular collisions, and in 2014, the commission set a goal to reduce deer-related collisions by 50%.</p>
<p>Since that time, Mt. Lebanon has conducted, with the help of contractors and professional hunters, archery hunts and deer sharpshooting to cull the deer, as well as nonlethal methods, including teaching residents about best gardening practices and banning deer feeding.</p>
<p>“We have both a community-managed archery hunt and an annual deer sharpshooting program that we do in partnership with the Pennsylvania Game Commission,” Mr. McMeans said. “The archery program is one of the many prongs of our deer management program.”</p>
<p>The proposal from Suburban Wildlife Management Solutions is the same as last year’s, and the archers would be permitted to hunt in “a handful of municipal facilities” such as Mt. Lebanon’s parks. Additionally, the hunters may hunt on private properties that are donated to the program and are checked out by the Mt. Lebanon Police Department.</p>
<p>Hunters will also be vetted by Suburban Wildlife Management Solutions. Each of the arrows have an individual identifier on it, and Mt. Lebanon will provide hunters with municipal identification.</p>
<p>“So if there’s a question about shots or a missing arrow, we have a way to track that,” said Mt. Lebanon Manager Keith McGill.</p>
<p>Hunters do not take any shots that are more than 20 yards away and utilize tree stands for their hunting. Mr. Brunetti said all hunters are insured under the company’s policy.</p>
<p>The commissioners’ Tuesday meeting will be held in person in commission chambers in the Municipal Building at 710 Washington Road. The board had been meeting virtually since April due to the coronavirus pandemic. Everyone who plans on attending the meeting must wear a mask. </p>
