<h1>COVID-19 hasn't killed the buffet — yet</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Visitors to the newly reopened Rivers Casino on the North Shore may notice that one staple of the traditional casino experience is missing: the buffet. For now, the Grand View Buffet won’t be filled with steaming dishes of food — a preventative measure against COVID-19 transmission.</p>
<p>Self-service elements for hungry gamblers will be “limited to prepackaged, grab-and-go menu items and bottled soft drinks only,” said Andrea Kleinrock-Marmion, vice president of food and beverage for Rivers Casino Pittsburgh, in an email statement.</p>
<p>In the world of the pandemic, where shared surfaces have become a serious concern for viral transmission, buffets are getting a lot of attention. Some, like the one at Rivers Casino, have temporarily closed to avoid the issue. But some restaurants whose entire business model is self-service food are adapting to stay afloat in the new reality.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal Indian buffet in Ross recently reopened to the public, but it’s not business as usual for the customers or staff, said owner and manager Usha Sethi. The restaurant has reworked its menu to work as a “sit-down buffet,” Ms. Sethi said, where diners can pay about $10 to have a platter of meat and/or vegetable dishes brought to their table.</p>
<p>Per Allegheny County public health regulations, the restaurant is limiting capacity to 50% or below and requiring social distancing and mask-wearing be practiced by visitors and employees, as well as frequent hand-washing and/or hand sanitizer use.</p>
<p>The county health department guidelines for restaurants in the green phase of Gov. Tom Wolf’s reopening plan are extensive, and they specifically note that buffets pose an especially large risk. The guidelines say that restaurants can open their self-service stations — with a list of precautions in place.</p>
<p>The guidelines recommend removing dishware from buffet stations, instead placing it at tables or giving it to individual customers; changing serving utensils every 30 minutes; not allowing customers to take a second helping on a dirty plate; and providing ample hand sanitizer for both customers and employees.</p>
<p>And travelers may see different systems in place in other parts of America.</p>
<p>Jonathan Maze, editor-in-chief of the trade magazine Restaurant Business, noted that while most states have followed the federal government’s guidelines that call for banning all self-service food and beverages during the COVID-19 pandemic, some — like Pennsylvania — have not done so or have allowed such stations in a less-restrictive reopening phase.</p>
<p>Mr. Maze said the federal restriction has resulted in the liquidation of major San Diego-based buffet company Souplantation &amp; Sweet Tomatoes, an event that he called “extremely rare.”</p>
<p>Hokkaido Seafood Buffet in Squirrel Hill is now open for business with limits in place. Manager Teh Hamed said the buffet experience at the restaurant is mostly “normal,” although Hokkaido is limiting its capacity to a 50% maximum and enforcing social distancing and mask-wearing.</p>
<p>The $10.99 all-you-can-eat buffet features seafood specialties such as maki and sashimi, as well as crab legs (these, as several miffed Yelp reviews note, are technically not all you can eat, because visitors are limited to seven each).</p>
<p>Mr. Hamed noted the restaurant has not seen an especially large in-person turnout — possibly, he speculated, because customers didn’t know the buffet was open to diners. Still, he said, the restaurant is open and serving the dishes it’s known for: “We have sushi, sashimi, everything.”</p>
<p>Eat’n Park, a Homestead-based restaurant chain with locations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, opened most of its Pennsylvania restaurants for dine-in service on June 5. But in addition to the standard COVID-19 precautions of social distancing, mask-wearing and aggressive surface sanitizing, the restaurants will be keeping their self-service soup, salad and fruit bars closed.</p>
<p>Mr. Maze said that even before the novel coronavirus, most buffet restaurant chains were having a hard time.</p>
<p>“Consumers have been going into another direction,” he said, adding that Raleigh, N.C.-based national buffet chain Golden Corral is the only company of its type to show continuing growth over the past few years while similar companies have foundered.</p>
<p>Instead of the more traditional buffet model, consumers have been moving toward faster counter-service “fast casual” restaurants, such as the national Cal-Mex chain Chipotle.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Golden Corral has temporarily changed its business model at some of its locations —&nbsp;doing “family-style” dining at some, where servers bring platters of favorite dishes to tables; “cafeteria-style” at others, where customers get food from a buffet, but it’s served to them by restaurant employees; and to-go service only at a few more.</p>
<p>In Western Pennsylvania, according to the company’s website, the only open location is in Hermitage, and it’s doing a socially distanced “normal” buffet format.</p>
<p>It’s possible the additional difficulties imposed by the pandemic will be the final straw for customers already moving away from the self-service model.</p>
<p>“The issue to me with buffets going forward is less about whether consumers are serving themselves or somebody else is serving consumers,” Mr. Maze said. “It’s whether consumers are going to be comfortable going there at all.”</p>
