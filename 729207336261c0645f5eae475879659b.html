<h1>Jameson Taillon OK with players feuding amid sign-stealing scandal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Jameson Taillon has obviously been following the sign-stealing scandal enveloping his hometown Houston Astros.</p>
<p>After all, Taillon is hurt; he’s not dead.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Recently that saga has taken an interesting — but predictable — turn, with players from other teams teeing off on the Astros and their garbage can-banging tactics, specifically Reds pitcher Trevor Bauer and Dodgers outfielder Cody Bellinger on Friday.</span></p>
<p>Taillon, who serves as the Pirates’ representative for the Major League Baseball Players Union, has no issue with players openly criticizing other players. However, he does hope this entire conversation eventually leads to some progress.</p>
<p>“Guys are starting to realize the importance and value of having a voice,” Taillon said Saturday at Pirate City. “What I’ve been hearing from the Players Association is when it comes to sign stealing, players want it to stop, and we have the power to make it stop. If you really want it to stop, speak up.”</p>
<p>The directive to speak up means a couple different things here. For Bauer, that resulted in an expletive-filled tirade to reporters on Friday, where he called the Astros “cheaters” and “hypocrites” and accused them of cheating players around the league and baseball as a whole.</p>
<p>It also means fixing this, Taillon said. Everybody’s mad, but what sort of constructive action can be taken to make sure this doesn’t happen again?</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Teams want a fair playing field,” Taillon said. “We can set rules and regulations in place. If we have ideas, it’s our responsibility to speak out. If we want change, we have to be willing to not just complain to each other, but we need to actually go to the Players Association, to teams, to Major League Baseball and say we want rules and regulations in place to stop this from ever happening again. We need to step up and actually think of some ideas.”</span></p>
<p>The idea of players bashing players — normally pretty rare regardless of the sport — did catch Taillon by surprise, especially coming from the 24-year-old Bellinger, last year’s National League MVP.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Bellinger accused the Astros of stealing their 2017 World Series championship because they cheated, the same with Houston second baseman Jose Altuve and the American League MVP award he won over Yankees slugger Aaron Judge that same year. “Weak” was how Bellinger described Astros owner Jim Crane’s clumsy apology a couple days prior.</span></p>
<p>“Cody Bellinger is coming off an MVP year. If he speaks, you listen,” Taillon said. “Trevor Bauer has been doing this for years. We have to be careful with what we do with our voices, but at the same time, I’m happy to see baseball players stepping out of their comfort zone.”</p>
<p>Much of the fuss surrounding this stuff has also included the aforementioned apology … or whatever attempt the Astros tried to make at one. Many have felt it wasn’t sincere, and Crane made no friends by insisted that their sign-stealing schemes had nothing to do with the outcomes of games — essentially showing zero accountability.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Taillon is trying to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, although he also thinks there’s only so much the Astros can do. He basically thinks about it like this: Let everyone be mad and get it out, then after the Astros take it for awhile, let’s all move this thing forward and affect some positive change.</span></p>
<p>“I would like to think that deep down they’re all sorry, they realize what they did, and they’re just getting the best advice on apologizing,” Taillon said.</p>
<p>“But I don’t think anything they say is going to make guys just move on and forgive them. I think they just need to weather the storm. Over time, once games start, guys will forget. What can you say at this point? Maybe the best thing is to not really say much going forward and just play.”</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">‘Large, large man’</span></strong></p>
<p>Pirates prospect Oneil Cruz turned a few heads on Friday when he said his goal was to play in the major leagues this season. A 6-foot-8 shortstop who’s athletic but extremely raw, Cruz has not yet reached Triple-A.</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton wasn’t completely aware of what Cruz said, but he sounded encouraged by the confidence displayed by the 21-year-old prospect.</p>
<p>“I love that,” Shelton said. “Guys should come into camp with that thought all the time. If he said that, that’s sick. I’m glad he thinks that way.”</p>
<p>Shelton watched Cruz hit and take ground balls Saturday and met with him inside the manager’s office Friday. Shelton’s first impression?</p>
<p>“Wow,” Shelton said. “That’s a large, large man.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Large enough, apparently, that Shelton made a basketball reference when he was asked about the stigma attached to tall shortstops.</span></p>
<p>“I think the stigma is if you’re going to play the three or the four, people don’t know if you’re going to be a shooting guard or if you’re going to play in the paint,” Shelton said, later adding, “From what I hear, he can really shoot. So maybe he’ll play the two.”</p>
