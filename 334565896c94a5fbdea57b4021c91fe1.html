<h1>After late start, Blake Cederlind ‘eager’ for opportunity with Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Blake Cederlind made quite an impression during spring training 1.0, the Pirates reliever occasionally touching triple digits on the radar gun while his blonde locks flapped in the wind and his post-strikeout strut garnered plenty of attention — and laughter — on Twitter.</p>
<p>On TV, AT&amp;T SportsNet analyst Michael McKenry referred to Cederlind as “Baby Thor,” comparing Cederlind to Noah Syndergaard of the Mets. And it became clear that Cederlind, an affable 24-year-old from Turlock, Calif., would soon become a key part of the Pirates’ bullpen.</p>
<p>But the only thing we’ve heard about Cederlind since the Pirates reconvened at PNC Park was that he tested positive for the coronavirus, then was later sent to their alternate training site in Altoona. General manager Ben Cherington said Saturday of Cederlind, “We want to make sure that he’s had enough reps and enough buildup where he’s in a safe spot. He’s on his way to that.”</p>
<p>Cederlind has been doing his part by throwing hard and refining his approach. But, yeah, the waiting has absolutely been the hardest part.</p>
<p>“I have been really eager,” Cederlind told the Post-Gazette by phone on Saturday afternoon. “I’ve been impatient. I just try to go to bed early and not think about it too much. Hope my time will come soon.”</p>
<p><span>It likely won’t be much longer for the former fifth-round pick who shot through the Pirates’ minor league system after tweaking his pitch mix to incorporate a deadly sinker in February 2019.</span></p>
<p>Cederlind has been pitching in the simulated games that occur most nights at Peoples Natural Gas Field. To this point, Cederlind’s velocity has set between 97-99 mph, while he’s working on refining his breaking ball, a cutter/slider hybrid that he’s able to manipulate to fit the situation.</p>
<p>“Things are going well,” Cederlind said. “I got my feet back under me. Body feels good. Arm feels good. It’s just nice to be back and doing what I love.”</p>
<p><span>Not a moment too soon, either. Cederlind said he wasn’t symptomatic when he arrived in Pittsburgh for intake testing but started to feel worse soon after learning he had COVID-19. Although Cederlind was hesitant to talk about symptoms or say he’s had it worse than anyone else, it definitely set him back.</span></p>
<p><span>“I don’t know judging by other peoples’ symptoms what’s severe and what’s not,” said Cederlind, who was cleared around the third week of July. “But, yeah, it took a toll on me while I had it. It was frustrating, but I’m good to go now.”</span></p>
<p><span>To build back up, Cederlind said the Pirates started him on a two-week throwing program, and he progressed from throwing two or three side sessions per week to games. Off-field training started with body-weight stuff and progressed based on how Cederlind was feeling.</span></p>
<p>After testing positive, Cederlind said he remained in the apartment he rented in Pittsburgh. He spent a lot of time on his phone and continued to throw by chucking baseballs into his couch and mattress.</p>
<p><span>“I came out of the gates, I think, just fine,” Cederlind said. “I was throwing in my apartment as best I could. Obviously it’s not the same kind of reps. I was just working with what I have.”</span></p>
<p>As for the furniture, Cederlind said it wasn’t that bad; nothing was too damaged. “I don’t think I ever broke 95 [mph],” he joked.</p>
<p><span>The simulated games have also been a challenge, Cederlind said. While he was extra careful to emphasize that he’s not about to complain, it has been a challenge to pitch off of adrenaline whenever you basically have to create that yourself.</span></p>
<p>And make no mistake, for anybody who watched Cederlind during spring training, there’s definitely excitement there. It’s a fun-to-watch mixture of goofy and intense, where Cederlind is flinging 100 mph fastballs, yet one time during spring training — because he refused to try new ones — he had an issue with one of his beat-up old spikes and tripped.</p>
<p><span>You never know what you’re going to see, which can be tough to replicate pitching against the same guys in a practice-like setting all the time.</span></p>
<p><span>“I do think there is a challenge there with it not being a real game,” Cederlind said. “Everyone knows it’s different, but it’s what we have and that’s what we have to do.</span></p>
<p><span>“I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing. It shows how much a real game means to a lot of us.”</span></p>
<p><span>Cederlind’s career has been an interesting one to track. He pitched to a 7.59 ERA with High-A Bradenton in 2018 and hardly seemed for breakout status, but the sinker turned out to be a boon for him.</span></p>
<p>It took the low spin rate on his four-seam fastball — which was causing it to get pummeled, despite the velocity — and flipped it into an asset, the sinker diving and getting a bunch of late movement. Meanwhile, Cederlind did not experience a velocity drop, and his career trajectory quickly shot upward.&nbsp;A 1.17 ERA and eight strikeouts in seven appearances with High-A Bradenton. Then 31 games at Class AA Altoona, where Cederlind went 5-1 with a 1.77 ERA and 42 strikeouts against just 16 walks in 45 2/3 innings.</p>
<p><span>The regular season finished with a cup of coffee at Class AAA Indianapolis before Cederlind pitched in the Arizona Fall League, turning heads with a 1.18 ERA and nine strikeouts.</span></p>
<p>Cederlind seems to know he’s close to earning that promotion and making his MLB debut, but he’s also trying to keep things in perspective.</p>
<p><span>Two years ago at this time, Cederlind was in the middle of getting crushed at High-A, allowing 20 runs (18 earned) in 21 1/3 innings, casting doubt on any sort of progress made. And now, he’s on the cusp of an MLB promotion.</span></p>
<p><span>“Any competitor would be eager to get there,” Cederlind said. “We all want to be there. That’s our dream. I try to take it out to the mound and let that fuel me.</span></p>
<p>“You don’t want to go out there all [ticked] off because then it can sometimes hurt you, trying to do too much. It’s tough balancing that. You want to do everything you can to impress whoever you need to impress. But then again, it’s out of my control. I’m going to do what I need to do to pitch to the best of my ability. It’ll all pan out.”</p>
<p>Does Cederlind think it’s possible that will happen in 2020?</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” he said. “No doubt.”</p>
