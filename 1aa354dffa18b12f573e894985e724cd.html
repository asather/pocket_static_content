<h1>New CEO hopes to raise profile of World Affairs Council</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburghers may be hearing more from the Pittsburgh World Affairs Council, as community figure Betty Cruz, 42, steps into the president and CEO role later this month. Reaching more Pittsburghers is a top priority for the Central Northside resident.</p>
<p>She will assume the new role on Jan. 21, taking over an 88-year-old organization that serves as a nonpartisan forum dedicated to “promoting a deeper understanding of key contemporary international issues,” according to the organization. The Pittsburgh World Affairs Council serves Western Pennsylvania and is a member of the World Affairs Council of America.</p>
<p>Ms. Cruz, the daughter of immigrants who fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba, will leave her job leading the Change Agency, a social enterprise she founded in 2016. Ms. Cruz heads the Agency’s All for All project, a Pittsburgh immigrant-inclusion initiative. Previously, she worked on Mayor Bill Peduto’s staff as deputy chief of special initiatives.</p>
<p>Monica Ruiz, executive director of Pittsburgh immigrants rights organization Casa San Jose, said she is excited about the new communities Ms. Cruz likely will involve in the council’s work.</p>
<p>She noted that right now, “No one really knows what the council does unless you are a member.” She spoke of a split between those involved in the council and many community organizers and NGO members.</p>
<p>Local Muslim advocate and Pittsburgh director of community entrepreneurship at Forward Cities Wasi Mohamed said that in the past, “global engagement in Pittsburgh has been more of an academic exercise.” He said that Ms. Cruz’ grassroots background will help continue the council’s recent positive trajectory and&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;" data-mce-mark="1">engage new community members.</span></p>
<p>Ms. Cruz said there are many Pittsburghers who are less included in the World Affairs Council’s work, such as members of the black community, new immigrant communities and the growing latinx community and she hopes to change that.</p>
<p>“[There are] voices that haven’t been at the table, that don't even know the table exists,” Ms. Cruz said. She said she hopes to involve the “elected officials and influencers” as much as the “doers” on the ground.</p>
<p>When she steps into the new role, Ms. Cruz said she will work to both honor the council’s important legacy and expand its reach.</p>
<p>The council currently has programs for students and adults, from education programs in secondary schools to public policy programs for the professional community. Ms. Cruz said she hopes to get students involved in —and even help to co-design — their professionally geared programs, for example bringing students to panels and luncheons to introduce the speakers.</p>
<p>At its best, Ms. Cruz said the council should build “fact-based, non-partisan conversation[s] that moves toward actions,” empowering and educating youth on what affects them locally and around the world.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh became the second city in the United States to adopt the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Ms. Cruz said this is just one example in which the country is lagging behind, and Pittsburgh has the opportunity to be a bold leader, bridging local issues to national and global ones.</p>
<p>Chairman of the board at the council Stephen Lackey emphasized that “Pittsburgh as a community does not operate in isolation,” and said the city should embrace globalization. He said the council can help push the city in that direction.</p>
<p>Those who have worked with her commend Ms. Cruz’ ability to connect many kinds of people.</p>
<p>“I really stand in awe of Betty’s ability to consider the vast spectrum of perspectives … whenever something comes across her desk,” said Nathan Darity, executive director at the Global Switchboard. The switchboard supports and connects a variety of coalition-lead organizations in Pittsburgh, including Ms. Cruz’ All for All project, with the goal of transforming Pittsburgh into a more global and equitable community.</p>
<p>Ms. Ruiz pointed to her unique ability to navigate different worlds.</p>
<p>“She’ll sit at a community dinner and eat tacos with her hands, and then have dinner with the mayor,” Ms. Ruiz said.</p>
<p>Ms. Ruiz said Ms. Cruz comes at her work with the goal of highlighting immigrants’ contributions to the Pittsburgh community, rather than pitying them.</p>
<p>Ms. Cruz was chosen for the president and CEO position from among 45 candidates, according to Mr. Lackey, who said he was impressed by “the dynamism she brings and her commitment to a global perspective for Pittsburgh.” Mr. Lackey headed the search committee.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Lackey said some of the candidates were not local to Pittsburgh, he said Ms. Cruz’ relationships throughout the community will be an asset.</p>
<p>For the first 100 days of her new job, Ms. Cruz said her job is to listen. Later, she hopes to help bridge the gaps between different communities of Pittsburghers.</p>
<p>Her transition team will act as a “sounding board” for Ms. Cruz to help her think about what work needs to be done and how to turn ideas into action. The team will include not only members of the council’s board, but also community allies such as members of grassroots organizations and elected officials.</p>
<p>Ms. Cruz said hopes the council can become “an institution that is seen and heard as relevant in Pittsburgh,” and added that there is room for the organization to move toward being more of a leader rather than “one of many.”</p>
<p>“We can absolutely step into a leadership position that bridges Pittsburgh to the world and expand our role ... as a convener as a partner, as a leader who is willing to shine the light on important, sometimes difficult conversations that … [affect] us as a city, as a region, as a country,” Ms. Cruz said.</p>
