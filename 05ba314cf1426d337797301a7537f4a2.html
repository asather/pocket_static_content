<h1>Bethel Park High School warns parents about possible whooping cough threat</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>School officials confirmed Tuesday that a student at&nbsp;Bethel Park High School has whooping cough.</p>
<p>An email sent to parents from the school warned that their children may have been exposed to the disease.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes the pertussis infection as a&nbsp;“highly contagious respiratory disease” that causes&nbsp;“uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe.”</p>
<p>The CDC states that infected people are most contagious for two weeks after the cough begins. The disease spreads person-to-person through coughing or sneezing, or when spending a lot of time near an infected person.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department has received an average of 86 reports of whooping cough per year since 2010, according to ACHD epidemiologist Dr. Kristen Mertz.</p>
<p>Ms. Mertz added that although the disease is contagious, it is vaccine preventable.</p>
<p>Bethel Park Principal Zeb Jasantye recommended in the email to parents that older children and parents get a Tdap vaccine booster if they haven’t already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Jasantye advised students with cold and cough symptoms to see a doctor and tell them they may have been exposed to whooping cough.</p>
<p>Health department officials said the&nbsp;Allegheny County Health Department&nbsp;is working with the school to control measures and monitor the situation.</p>
