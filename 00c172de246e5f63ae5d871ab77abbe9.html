<h1>New coach Olivia Kruger excited about Greensburg Central Catholic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>How does Olivia Kruger feel about taking over the Greensburg Central Catholic girls soccer team? Lucky. Very, very, very, very, very, lucky.</p>
<p>“You can quote me on those five luckys,” said Kruger. “There is so much talent on the field.”</p>
<p>As a first-year head coach, it is hard for Kruger not to feel extremely fortunate at the helm of such a distinguished program that routinely wins titles and fields star players.</p>
<p>The WPIAL expanded to add Class 1A girls soccer in 2010. Since then, the Centurions have been flat out dominant, claiming five district titles and playing in others. That history of success is motivation enough. No player wants to be part of a team that didn’t keep pace with the expectations of the program. Every year, they expect to compete for gold.</p>
<p>“From the moment they walk on the field, you can tell there is a confidence,” said Kruger. “They really want to perform and do their best and that shows in their work ethic. They really want to see the postseason and see a title.”</p>
<p>Prior to leading the Centurions, Kruger was an assistant at Wilson College and also the Hotspurs club team. Her husband, Zak, is the women’s soccer coach at Seton Hill University.</p>
<p>“It’s literally soccer nonstop in our house,” Olivia Kruger said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Kruger is not from the western part of the state, but she does know all about the Centurions. Kruger played at Tulpehocken, also a PIAA 1A school, and had heard all about the GCC program. Now, she gets to lead the program after former coach Ashley Davis resigned after three seasons.</p>
<p>Since 2010, the main competition for the Centurions in 1A has been Shady Side Academy, which has claimed four WPIAL championships, including last season when it beat GCC in the final. That rivalry has ended for the time being, as Shady Side Academy bumped up to Class 2A in the latest realignment. Freedom is the only school besides GCC or Shady Side Academy to win the 1A title, doing so in 2018. The Bulldogs are expected to make another run at it with the reigning WPIAL goal-scoring queen Renae Mohrbacher leading the way.</p>
<p>The Centurions have plenty of talent as well, including Villanova recruit Tatum Gretz and IUP commit Sam Felder. The Centurions opened their season Monday by breezing past Springdale, 6-0.</p>
<p>“I am just really excited to coach these girls,” said Kruger. “I’m hoping to see us really succeed this year and hopefully see us in the postseason.”</p>
<p><strong>Mars-West Allegheny</strong></p>
<p>Mars was the most dominant force in all of Class 3A last year, collecting WPIAL and PIAA gold while rolling to an unbeaten record. West Allegheny was a scrappy upstart program that claimed its first section title in school history. The Indians placed third in the WPIAL and advanced to the state quarterfinals, where their season ended in a 4-0 loss to the Planets.</p>
<p>What happened when the two teams faced each other this year? It was the same result, but much closer in an excellent match. Mars, still ranked No. 1 in the WPIAL, got a second-half goal from Purdue recruit Gracie Dunaway to secure a 1-0 triumph.</p>
<p><strong>Norwin</strong></p>
<p>The Knights are no stranger to Westmoreland County foe Latrobe. What was unusual is that the Wildcats were able to get a lead, albeit a short one. Dating back to at least the 2003 season, Norwin has swept the Wildcats in section play every year. Latrobe came out firing Tuesday and took a two-goal lead, before the Knights rallied for a 4-2 victory.</p>
