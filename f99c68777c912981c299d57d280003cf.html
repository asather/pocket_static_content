<h1>WVU suspends 29 students amid probe over coronavirus-policy violations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>West Virginia University has placed 29 students on immediate interim suspension during an ongoing investigation into alleged violations of the school’s COVID-19 policy.</p>
<p>School officials said that social media posts over the weekend showed large parties at fraternities not recognized by the university, which led them to investigate.</p>
<p>Officials said that a member of the Theta Chi fraternity tested positive for the virus and had been notified to isolate, but attended a party hosted by the fraternity on Friday anyway.</p>

<p>The university also alleges that it had previously notified all members of Theta Chi living in the fraternity’s house that they must isolate themselves due to close contacts with other positive cases.</p>
<p>As a result, 29 members of Theta Chi have been charged with failure to comply with isolation orders. The students were notified of the decision earlier Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The suspension means that the students are banned from campus and cannot attend classes, including ones offered online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Immediate interim suspensions are used when we determine a student presents a safety risk to campus,” dean of students Corey Farris said. “We know that these parties act as super spreaders. Their flagrant disregard for the health and safety of their classmates, our campus, and the entire Morgantown community will not be tolerated.”</p>
<p>Officials said that they are also currently investigating a large party hosted by Alpha Sigma Phi, another fraternity not recognized by the university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“While we are aware that some students have made the wrong decision to attend house parties off-campus, we also know the majority have occurred at unaffiliated fraternity houses,” Mr. Farris said. “This should serve as a message to anyone else who thinks the rules don’t apply to them. They do, and we will hold you accountable.”</p>
<p>The university will continue to aggressively identify others attending large gatherings, officials said, and will work to bring charges against those found violating the Student Code of Conduct.</p>
