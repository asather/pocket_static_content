<h1>Bullpen spoils Mitch Keller’s no-hit bid in Pirates loss</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mitch Keller brought a perennial playoff contender’s offense to a screeching halt Saturday at PNC Park, holding the St. Louis Cardinals without a hit over six brilliant innings in his second start back from a left oblique injury.</p>
<p>But even though Keller was terrific, he was powerless when it came to assisting the Pirates bullpen, the group sputtering, stalling and eventually crashing as Pittsburgh continued to limp toward the finish line with another frustrating defeat.</p>
<p>The Pirates lost, 5-4, because their bullpen imploded in the seventh inning once Keller exited the game, improbably snatching defeat from the jaws of victory by flipping a 4-0 lead into another one-run loss, their MLB-high 13th this season.</p>
<p>"It wasn't easy to watch," Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. "We went from 4-0 to 5-4 really quick. We didn't execute. And if we don't execute, we're going to put ourselves in those positions."</p>
<p>It’s actually the second consecutive game for the Pirates featuring a hideous inning, although Friday it was more the defense’s fault, when Ke’Bryan Hayes and Josh Bell made errors, Gregory Polanco didn’t hit the cutoff man and the Pirates coughed up six runs — one earned.</p>
<p>Saturday honestly might’ve been worse. It certainly had to be more painful. At least Chad Kuhl — Friday’s victim — hadn’t retired 14 in a row as Keller had, the Pirates bullpen taking his outing from the left lane, hammer down, to Parkway traffic at rush hour.</p>
<p>The bullpen meltdown started with Geoff Hartlieb, who opened the seventh by issuing two walks and hitting Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina. That’s when Shelton turned to Sam Howard, who allowed a two-run double to left fielder Tyler O’Neill.</p>
<p>Right fielder Dylan Carlson followed with a sacrifice fly, bringing the Cardinals to within a run, before second baseman Kolten Wong’s single to right tied the game at 4. St. Louis took the lead when the next batter, third baseman Tommy Edman, lined a single to left.</p>
<p>"It’s different if we get beat because of the fact that balls are hit in the gaps," Shelton said. "But we can’t give free bases. That’s one thing you can’t do."</p>
<p>The sum total of the disaster included three walks, two hit batters and 47 pitchers thrown by three different relievers. In Hartlieb’s case, he’s now either walked (eight) or hit (two) 10 of the past 14 batters he’s faced.</p>
<p>It’s too bad, too, because Saturday should’ve been about a Pirates victory showcasing the future of the franchise. Not only Keller but Hayes — who had a home run and a double — and Blake Cederlind, who pitched a 1-2-3 eighth and struck out two, regularly touching 99 mph on the PNC Park radar gun.</p>
<p>"I think it’s a positive sign for Pirates fans moving forward, the effectiveness of those guys," Shelton said.</p>
<p>Maybe. But these current Pirates (15-37) have now lost 11 of their past 12 after winning two in a row and four of six. They’re 4-5 against the Cardinals (25-24) this season, with a chance to salvage a split on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>The bullpen hiccup was somewhat unexpected, as Pirates relievers came into Saturday’s game with the fourth-lowest ERA (3.05) in baseball dating back to Aug. 20.</p>
<p>Keller registered six strikeouts, four on fastballs. While Keller has two terrific breaking balls, it was notable that he was able to put hitters away with his four-seamer, which maxed out at 97.4 mph.</p>
<p>Even when the Cardinals connected against Keller, the ball wasn’t hit hard; his average exit velocity was just 86.7 mph. Keller also battled back into counts after throwing first-pitch strikes to just nine of the 21 men he faced.</p>
<p>Saturday marked Keller’s second start back after returning from injury. In that first one, in Cincinnati on Sept. 14, Keller threw 65 pitches over three innings, struggling with his control some and walking four.</p>
<p>This outing was much more precise, with everything coming together nicely.</p>
<p>"[Saturday] I felt in control," Keller said. "When I did spray my fastball a little bit, I was able to get it right back. Really exciting to put it all together and have good outcomes."</p>
<p>On the offensive side, it’s laughable to think of the concerns that swirled around Hayes’ ability to hit at this level. He certainly looks capable. His nine extra-base hits mark the second-most for a Pirate in his first 17 games since 1980.</p>
<p>The only player with more was Barry Bonds, with 10 back in 1986.</p>
<p>Cardinals starter Kwang Hyun Kim came into Saturday’s game having allowed just one home run all season, but the Pirates touched him for two solo shots in the first three innings, including one from Hayes.</p>
<p>With an 0-2 count, Hayes hit an elevated fastball third of home run the season. Even more impressive, Kim came into this one holding opposing hitters to a .122 batting average and .224 slugging percentage on his fastball.</p>
<p>"You can tell whenever you’re hitting the ball really good," said Hayes, who has an average exit velocity of 93.9 mph since making his MLB debut, which is sixth-best in baseball. "In my cage work and all that, I just try to go up there and work on my approach and try to hit the ball hard.”</p>
<p>Jose Osuna got the second solo second, while the Pirates got their other two runs on a Colin Moran single and sacrifice fly from Jacob Stallings.</p>
<p><strong>Newman hurt</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Newman went down in a heap in the top of the ninth inning when he was hit by a pitch on the left knee by Cardinals pitcher Genesis Cabrera. No update was immediately available, but Newman was unable to put any weight on his leg.</p>
