<h1>After 13 terms in office, state Rep. Harry Readshaw announces retirement</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the midst of facing a progressive primary challenge, Pennsylvania Rep. Harry Readshaw announced on Tuesday that he will retire at the end of the current legislative session.</p>
<p>Mr. Readshaw, D-Allegheny, has represented the 36th legislative district since 1995, and currently chairs the House Professional Licensure Committee.</p>
<p>His retirement will take effect after the end of the two-year legislative session on Nov. 30.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Readshaw he's felt "honored" to have support from his constituents over 13 terms.</p>
<p>Mr. Readshaw hadn't yet announced if he would run again for his seat, which is up for primary election on April 28. He would have faced progressive activist Jessica Benham, a 28-year-old South Side Slopes resident who helped found an advocacy group in Pittsburgh that supports autistic people.</p>
<p>The primary and general elections will proceed as usual, but without Mr. Readshaw on the ballot, a spokesman for the House Democrats confirmed.</p>
<p>If elected, Ms. Benham would be the first autistic woman to serve in the state legislature, as well as the first LGBTQ+ female legislator.</p>
