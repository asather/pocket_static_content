<h1>Gregory Polanco on Clemente’s No. 21: ‘I hope they retire it’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gregory Polanco had to look no further than his feet Wednesday to see what he was stepping into, the same sort of prominent role Polanco has held since making his Pirates debut back in 2014.</p>
<p>Right field at PNC Park.</p>
<p>In front of a 21-foot wall commemorating Roberto Clemente.</p>
<p>Where, on Wednesday, a giant No. 21 was etched into the grass to celebrate Roberto Clemente Day.</p>
<p>It’s an honor Polanco said he loves. Growing up in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Polanco — the same as so many Latin American ballplayers — idolized Clemente, for his grace, freakish athleticism and warm spirit.</p>
<p>Which is why, as Polanco tugged a No. 21 jersey over his head for a game against the White Sox, he was overcome with emotion.</p>
<p>“A kid from the Dominican, having nothing and just to come here and play in right field in front of that wall that has such a significant name like Roberto Clemente and all that history, I’m like, ‘Wow,’ ” Polanco said. “I’m just grateful, thankful to be there and represent him every day and play hard because that’s the way he played.”</p>
<p>As the Pirates — as well as natives of Puerto Rico across Major League Baseball — donned No. 21 jerseys to commemorate Roberto Clemente Day on Wednesday, Polanco also hoped the number would be retired, just like Jackie Robinson’s No. 42.</p>
<p>“It’s special,” Polanco said. “This is [my] first time wearing it. We’re going to wear it, be thankful, grateful, and I hope they retire it. I hope the Number 21 is retired around baseball.”</p>
<p>Growing up, Polanco said it was routine to hear about Clemente’s legacy. Similar to how baseball-loving Black children idolize Jackie Robinson, it’s that way when it comes to the Latin American community and Clemente.</p>
<p>“He’s our Jackie Robinson,” Polanco said. “He’s our idol. ... What he did and the way he helped people was unbelievable.”</p>
<p><span>Before the game, Pirates players took the field wearing their No. 21 jerseys and posed for a photo. Manager Derek Shelton said the atmosphere around the clubhouse was so jubilant that it felt like a holiday.</span></p>
<p>“We're doing something that nobody's ever done before,” Shelton said. “One of the things I told my wife [Wednesday] before we left was that I think it's one of the things I'm most proud of, to be part of something like this.”</p>
<p><strong>Special moments</strong></p>
<p>Shelton said he experienced a couple special moments leading up to Wednesday’s game. One was FaceTiming with former major leaguer and current ESPN commentator Eduardo Perez, whose wife is from Clemente’s hometown of Carolina, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Shelton also got a few texts of photos from third-base coach Joey Cora, a native of Puerto Rico, of downtown San Juan and the excitement there to celebrate Clemente’s legacy.</p>
<p>Shelton also exchanged texts with the Twins’ interpreter, Elvis Martinez, who’s from Puerto Rico. Martinez conveyed excitement for Puerto Rican Twins players such as Eddie Rosario and Jose Berrios, who will both wear No. 21.</p>
<p>“I think it's really important for us to make sure that we can continue to talk about Roberto,” Shelton said. “For our generation, my generation, I'm 50. I get it. I've got to make sure Jackson, my son, who's 20, gets it. We have to make sure his kids get it.</p>
<p>“Again, it's not just what [Clemente] did on the field and the fact that he had one of the coolest finishes to a swing of anybody, with the back leg up, or that the arm was stronger than just about anybody in the game. It's what he did off the field, how he gave, and that's something that's extremely important.”</p>
<p><strong>Charity work</strong></p>
<p>To celebrate Roberto Clemente Day, the Pirates make it a habit to do a bunch of charity work. Among the highlights:</p>
<p>• Joined Beverly’s Birthdays staff at Priory Fine Pastries to purchase cookies for a baby shower program hosted monthly for area single moms.</p>
<p>• Hosted a meal and mask distribution with Jerry’s Pizzeria at the Latino Community Center.</p>
<p>• Gifted Pittsburgh Courier subscriptions to local libraries; Pirates staff recorded and shared personal book reads for the library archives.</p>
<p>• Purchased food service and sanitation supplies from RS Supply and delivered them to Light of Life Rescue Mission.</p>
<p>• Worked with the Humane Animal Rescue to host a shopping spree at Wagsburgh.</p>
<p>• Visited with Pittsburgh Bureau Fire stations 30 and 37, as well as AHN’s Lifeflight unit to deliver North Shore Tavern gift cards.</p>
<p>• Sent gift cards to Giant Eagle’s South Side location.</p>
<p>• Hosted a drive-thru distribution event with the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, serving 500 families and presenting a check on behalf of Josh Bell, the Pirates’ 2020 Roberto Clemente Award nominee.</p>
<p>“Any time we can do things in the community that promote not only the Pirates organization, the Clemente Foundation or the Clemente family, it's extremely important,” Shelton said. “One of the things that we have talked about a lot is Roberto Clemente, the player, is one of the greatest players of all time. Roberto Clemente the humanitarian was probably the greatest humanitarian in the history of our sport.”</p>
