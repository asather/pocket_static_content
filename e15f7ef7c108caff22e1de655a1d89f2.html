<p>The Dunkin’ Donuts coffee-chain said Thursday that it expects to permanently close about 800 locations nationwide, according to CNN.</p>
<p>Dunkin’ said the locations have low sales volume and represent only 2% of its U.S. sales last year. The company did not say what locations would close.</p>
<p>The company detailed the changes in its quarterly earnings report and described the closures as a “real estate portfolio rationalization.”</p>
<p>More than half of the closures are in Speedway convenience stores.</p>
