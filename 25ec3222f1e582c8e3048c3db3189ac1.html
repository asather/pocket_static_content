<h1>Ex-GOP strategist Rick Wilson returns with another anti-Trump tome</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The political consultant Rick Wilson does not like President Donald Trump. Mr. Wilson, like many others, has turned this stance into something of a second career. His first book, “Everything Trump Touches Dies,” was published in advance of the midterm elections in 2018, and it reached No. 1 on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, he has a new book out for the 2020 election. The book is “Running Against the Devil: A Plot to Save America From Trump — and Democrats From Themselves,” and it fits tidily into the ever-expanding class of nonfiction written by commentators who spend the bulk of their intellectual life either on TV or Twitter (short chapters, unsourced claims, off-color jokes, name-calling, so on).</p>
<p>There is, I think, a deeper reading of why Mr. Wilson is writing these anti-Trump books, but on the surface, he is genuinely incensed by the presence of Donald Trump in the White House. A longtime Republican strategist, he now fashions himself as a man-without-a-party desperado who has flipped sides “because the party I worked for, fought for, and sweated over for thirty years didn’t just abandon people like me who couldn’t stomach Trump; they’re putting the entire American experience at risk.”</p>
<p>The book’s audience is nominally liberal Democrats unwilling to confront the unsavory realities of electoral politics. Mr. Wilson advertises himself as both a tour guide for the harsh world of presidential campaigns and also as a former architect of the “organized system for creating … weaponized outrages.” His perspective does produce stray moments of sound advice. When it comes to the 2020 presidential campaign, he advises Democrats to avoid using the word socialism, which plays right into the Republicans’ hands and “has a horrible branding problem.”</p>
<p>He also advises Democrats to completely abandon evangelicals. The “God squad,” as Mr. Wilson calls them, now live and operate within “an intolerant society separate from the rest of the United States.”</p>
<p>One of the dirtier tricks he brainstorms is funding a fake third-party candidate, a kind of mega-MAGA candidate that could potentially siphon off 2-3% of Mr. Trump’s base. This struck me as both extremely dangerous and mathematically wise.</p>
<p>So, on the surface, there’s some worthwhile advice in “Running Against the Devil.” But I confess that, part way through, Mr. Wilson’s style began to read shockingly, almost freakishly similar to President Trump’s. Fear-mongering has been a key tool for Mr. Trump in matters like the border wall, and fear-mongering is essential to “Running Against the Devil.” Mr. Wilson can barely go a paragraph without reminding readers that a second Trump term could be right around the corner. One paragraph ends thusly: “And the first term was just a preview.” For emphasis, he ends the next paragraph with another reminder: “In the second [term], all the political restraints are off.”</p>
<p>Like President Trump, Mr. Wilson is eager to cue up insults about appearance and intellect: “Trump isn’t Hitler. Hitler had normal-sized hands and the ability to concentrate for more than thirty seconds.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson even relies on crass mimicry in the same way that the president does. Mr. Wilson may claim to be aghast at the president’s impersonation of a reporter with a disability, yet Mr. Wilson strings along an entire comedic bit between chapters called “White House Diaries: Melania Trump.” In these fictionalized entries, he conveys the first lady’s inner monologue via broken English (all sic):</p>
<p><em>“I am hatings him.”</em></p>
<p>Later:<em> “Please gods, don’t lets him be reelect.”</em></p>
<p>These fake dairies are “how-did-this-get-published” bad. The worst assessment I can assign them is that they’re Trumpian in their mean spiritedness.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder a figure such as Mr. Trump ascended within a political party constructed by strategists such as Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson regularly outlines how he once injected fear and bigotry into the subtext of political speeches and advertisements, yet amazingly, he’s shocked that a pol would seize the needle themselves and shoot discord into every vein of American society.</p>
<p>A generous reading is that there’s shame beneath all of Mr. Wilson’s Trump-directed anger. I can’t help but also read a touch of jealousy — Mr. Trump has essentially sent strategists such as Mr. Wilson into early retirement. He has turned their subtextual magic into a more explicit, in-your-face enterprise. The surface of Mr. Wilson’s book certainly concerns how to defeat the man he calls a devil, but I found myself wondering: Does Mr. Wilson truly want to save democracy, or does he merely want to relocate the devil’s horns back onto his own strategy-obsessed head?</p>
