<h1>Penguins on pause: What's next in Sam Lafferty's feel-good story?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>Sam Lafferty helped write the feel-good story of the 2019-20 Penguins season.</p>
<p>Growing up in Hollidaysburg, a small community about five miles from Altoona and less than two hours from Pittsburgh, Lafferty fell in love with the Penguins during the 2000-01 run to the Eastern Conference final. His first stick had “LEMIEUX” written on the side. His favorite player, naturally, was Sidney Crosby.</p>
<p>On Oct. 8, the local kid made his NHL debut with the hometown team, when the Penguins 4-1 lost to the Winnipeg Jets.</p>
<p>Penguins coach Mike Sullivan was complimentary of Lafferty early this year, saying emphatically that he “belongs” in the NHL. The right-handed forward tallied five points in his first four NHL games and was part of a core group of call-ups that helped the Penguins weather injuries to some of their biggest names and best players.</p>
<p>Like any rookie, Lafferty went through his growing pains. While he spent the majority of the season in the NHL, Lafferty split time between Pittsburgh and the club’s AHL affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. In the weeks before the NHL paused its season, playing time was becoming harder to come by as the Penguins got healthier and added reinforcements via the trade market.</p>
<p>Lafferty, who turned 25 in March, will need to continue to evolve as his career continues to establish himself as a regular. But, as this season showed, he has several promising characteristics. At the top of the list is Lafferty’s speed. It’s probably one of his best attributes and fits seamlessly with the style of hockey the Penguins want to play.&nbsp;Now only time will tell if the kid who grew up watching the Penguins compete in the Eastern Conference final might also get to play in the postseason himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> When Lafferty stepped onto the ice for the first time on Oct. 8, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/10/09/Hollidaysburg-Sam-Lafferty-NHL-debut-pennsylvania-penguins/stories/201910090108" target="_blank">dozens of fans from Hollidaysburg and Altoona</a> made the trek to see the local kid make his debut. Coaches who won state championships and national titles with him. Trainers who put him through grueling workouts. Skating instructors who led him onto the ice for the first time. Neighbors. “Second dads.” Family friends. Even Lafferty’s dentist, who fixed a couple missing Chiclets, was there.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> After putting up five points in his first four games, Lafferty recorded just eight in his next 46 games.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> The Penguins are getting healthier. Jake Guentzel, Nick Bjugstad and Dominik Simon all might be ready to return by the time the season resumes. The club also bolstered its forward depth with the two-for-one trade that sent Dominik Kahun to Buffalo in exchange for Conor Sheary and Evan Rodrigues. The new-found health and depth might make it a challenge for the rookie to earn his spot on the postseason roster.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Lafferty is set to become a restricted free agent this offseason. Resigning the right-handed forward&nbsp;likely wouldn’t break the bank. Plus, he’s probably motivated to stick around and make some more memories in Pittsburgh. But given the number of salary cap decisions the Penguins have to make this offseason, nothing is a given.</p>
