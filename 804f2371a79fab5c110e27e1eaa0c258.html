<h1>Pandemic offers dads a chance to watch kids grow up in real time</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If there is a silver lining to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is a new pace of living for everyone. Some fathers have found more time to spend with their children, learning a little more about their concerns, fears, dreams and the things they love. For Father’s Day, we asked them what it’s been like. Here are their stories.</p>
<p><strong>Quincy Swatson</strong></p>
<p>Quincy Swatson has seen little things about his two sons that he hadn’t noticed before.</p>
<p>“This time has helped me be a more present father, not just physically but emotionally,” he said.</p>
<p>Before the coronavirus shutdown, Mr. Swatson, of Manchester, was the CEO of The Door Campaign, a nonprofit that enhances science learning through aquaponics in schools. He resigned last year to campaign for what turned out to be an unsuccessful run for Pittsburgh City Council.&nbsp;In those days, he had his sons, Quincy, 7, and Elijah, 3, on a strict schedule.</p>
<p>“I was the enforcer of the schedule. Now I ask, ‘What do you want to do today? What do you want to eat? Let’s cook it together.’ Being collaborative, they’re holding more weight now. They’re more agreeable. I don’t have to repeat myself as often.”</p>
<p>He and the boys spend a lot of time outdoors, playing tennis, hiking on trails and walking in North Side neighborhoods.&nbsp;He has learned that Quincy “loves to dance and loves musicals. That was something I hadn’t known before.”</p>
<p>Mr. Swatson has shared custody and spends several days a week with them.</p>
<p>“The uninterrupted time with my children has reignited why I am fighting for 50-50 custody. After a two-year battle, I had become fatigued. We need more support for black dads.”</p>
<p>When the pandemic ends, if life resumes its normal speed, Mr. Swatson hopes he remembers the value of slowing down, “to make sure we continue to spend unstructured time together, enjoying the day, going where the wind takes us.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing I’ve learned about being a father is not trying to control everything. I think some of the most genuine learning experiences come from the impromptu things we do.”</p>
<p><strong>Jason Prem</strong></p>
<p>Since before his two boys were born, Jason Prem has wanted to be a dad who is present.</p>
<p>A part-time van driver for Winchester Thurston School, he went back to school for a master’s degree in professional counseling at Carlow College. He was often too tired to play with 1-year-old Micah, and Carter, 3.</p>
<p>When both of his schools moved online, he was able to be home in Ross more with the boys and his wife, Erin, who works in admissions at Winchester Thurston.&nbsp;Shortly after Micah’s first birthday on March 30, father and son were playing on the living room carpet.</p>
<p>“All of a sudden, he started doing the wobble step,”&nbsp;Mr. Prem said.</p>
<p>Micah was taking his first real steps, and he was there to see it. He wasn’t hearing about it from his wife or getting a text from his parents, who often watch the boys.</p>
<p>He’s also been able to teach Carter how to throw and hit a baseball in the backyard.&nbsp;He is even loving bathtime, breakfast, dinner and the occasional meltdown. He listens as Carter says his prayers each night.</p>
<p>“You can’t make as much time as we have now,” says Mr. Prem, who is laid off and on summer break from college. “I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”</p>
<p>He and his wife, who is working from home, have taken the boys on several camping trips. One marked what would have been their daughter Mary Elizabeth’s fifth birthday. They lost her 36 weeks into Erin’s pregnancy.</p>
<p>Mary Elizabeth is the reason Mr. Prem wants to become a licensed counselor. It helps him see the pandemic’s silver lining and he hopes other parents can, too.</p>
<p>“They grow up fast and now I get to watch it happen in real time.</p>
<p>“I want them to look back and say, ‘I remember Dad being there and we were playing and having fun. We were just together.’”</p>
<p><strong>Chris Roach</strong></p>
<p>Chris Roach was used to caring for his two youngest children before the new coronavirus hit. He&nbsp;stopped working in August 2018 so his wife could resume her career as a teacher. Now, at their home in Uptown with all five children and his wife, Caroline, “it is constantly challenging because there’s not a pause or a stop,” he said.<span class="comment" style="font-size: 10pt;"><br></span></p>
<p>His wife carved out space to teach remotely while Mr. Roach tended to almost 3-year-old Elliot, Winifred, 5, Christopher, 9, Dorothy, 10, and Bailey, 12. Three are students at St. Benedict the Moor School and the fourth at Weil Elementary.</p>
<p>While the older kids finished their schoolwork remotely, he spent time working on the learning skills of the younger two.</p>
<p>Mr. Roach, who worked for Operation Safety Net in homeless services and advocacy before becoming a full-time parent, said this&nbsp;intense togetherness has been “exhausting.”</p>
<p>“But the role change was so helpful in seeing what my wife had gone through. This has been an opportunity to grow. The kids and I work together on things, decide things we want to do as a family. I think it’s important that they participate in making decisions and have buy-in.”</p>
<p>One surprising discovery was that Dorothy had been keeping an art journal.&nbsp;“I thought she went to bed and went to sleep, but often she is up late drawing in her journal.”</p>
<p>With the neighborhood playground off-limits, Mr. Roach devised a makeshift pool by wiring four baby gates together, putting a tarp over them and filling it with water in the family’s small backyard.</p>
<p>“From the beginning of the shutdown, I told them that we’ve been faced with a challenging situation but that of all the people in all the world I’d want to face it with, it is all of them.”</p>
<p><strong>Andre Samuel</strong></p>
<p>Andre Samuel has seen how intensely his two teenagers feel about their friends and favorite activities since he and his wife Alexandria have been home with them in Swissvale.</p>
<p>Reese, 19, and Riley, 14, had birthdays during the pandemic. Everything they loved, he said, “got snatched” when they were sentenced to life with their parents 24/7. “It has been a struggle,” he said.</p>
<p>Reese is a competitive swimmer at Howard University in Baltimore, and Riley, an avid volleyball player, just finished middle school at St. Edmund’s Academy in Squirrel Hill.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel is director of the Citizen Science Lab, a nonprofit partner of schools with locations in the Hill District and Bethel Park.</p>
<p>“Our relationships were pretty good before the shutdown,” he said of his family. “The shutdown allowed us to become closer. We found out some things they were dealing with, some significant struggles that we could help with.”</p>
<p>It troubled him that both teens were sleeping so much.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t healthy, so we said, ‘Take a walk.’&nbsp;There were lots of extra walks for the dog. We would go on bike rides.”</p>
<p>Then there was a shift. “Right around the time of George Floyd’s death, all of us started to bond, spend more time around each other, see what was happening in the news.”</p>
<p>While Riley recently returned to volleyball practice, with social distancing, Reese decided to organize a protest in Upper St. Clair, where the family lived before moving to Swissvale in October. He turned to some of his old high school buddies for help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reese plans to return to Howard University in the fall, “and we can’t wait for him to go back,” his father said. “Living with a child who’s also a grown man is a tricky place.”</p>
<p><strong>Erik Arroyo</strong></p>
<p>In mid-April, Summer Arroyo folded her hands in prayer as the family sat down to eat dinner.</p>
<p>“She says, ‘Dear Lord, thank you for this meal.’ And then she looks at us and says, ‘Is this lunch or dinner?’</p>
<p>“I said ‘That’s a good question, baby, because this is the exact meal we had for lunch. I understand why you’re confused,’” Erik Arroyo recalled.</p>
<p>Summer is 4½ years old and astute enough to realize something is very strange in the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Arroyo and his wife, Pam, are working from home in Whitehall. He is director of academic support services for the University for Teaching and Learning at the University of Pittsburgh.&nbsp;She is UPMC’s human resources director.</p>
<p>When they began stay-at-home work, they decided each evening to plan the next day’s schedule: Who would watch Summer if one of them had a meeting at a certain time? Who would fix dinner? Who would arrange for playtime?</p>
<p>Summer is old enough to be surprising every day, her father said. “It’s really cool to see her brain functioning in real time.”</p>
<p>It was a revelation that the little girl who previously had shown no interest in bicycles was suddenly thoroughly invested in one brought by the Easter Bunny.&nbsp;Mr. Arroyo dragged his old bike out of the shed and riding became a bonding experience.</p>
<p>“We make it a habit of biking a couple of times a week, even if it’s just me on the trainer in the garage. We’re in the same place and she’s doing laps.”</p>
<p>Summer’s confusion over their meal underscored a point the Arroyos have tried to make with her, that it’s OK to be a little mixed up, and to laugh about it.</p>
<p>“It’s about finding laughter and making the best of the hand that you’re dealt,” he said. “Be humble and grateful for what you have, and who you have.”</p>
<p><strong>Eric Randall</strong></p>
<p>Eric and Susan Randall have three kids at home in Highland Park, where he is working remotely as a mechanical engineer. She is sidelined from her usual summer horticultural work.</p>
<p>Alex, 19, just finished his freshman year at the University of Pittsburgh, Ben, 16, is a student of the Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy in Oakland and Cleo, 11, will start at Schiller Middle School in the fall. Their fourth child, Dayna, 19, lives on her own.</p>
<p>Remote schooling was difficult, Mr. Randall said, “but we made it through.”</p>
<p>The family has had a small community of support. They and three other households have committed to care for a fellow member of their church.</p>
<p>“She is a single mother who had cancer surgery,” Mr. Randall said. “Her post-surgery plan fell apart because the people who were going to care for her couldn’t come. So our four families formed a pod.</p>
<p>“The idea was that the four families would interact with each other and not with anyone else. We did a mix of taking the lady meals and we hosted the daughter at our homes.”</p>
<p>In recent weeks, he said, his older kids have been given more leeway about who they hang out with. “You are constantly negotiating ground rules.”</p>
<p>He and his boys have had good conversations about their lives, their relationships and the protests that sprang up in response to the death of Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis, he said.</p>
<p>“I told them they have to educate themselves about protests. You have to be careful. You have to be safe. You are a young man of color and you may end up having a different experience” than your white friends.</p>
<p>“It’s not the first time I’ve had the talk with my boys.”</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Ledford</strong></p>
<p>Had the new coronavirus not turned the world upside down, Brandon Ledford likely would have been traveling when his Charlotte, who is almost 2, took her first steps. But he was there to witness them, and so many other things — “developmental things, words and learning, letters and numbers,” said Mr. Ledford, a human resources consultant who lives with his daughter and wife Kate in Dormont.</p>
<p>“I typically traveled about 80% of the week, so I was a FaceTime dad for things like that before. Now I have routines with her, like reading to her at night. We did potty training over Memorial Day weekend. That was something I wouldn’t have experienced.”</p>
<p>He didn’t grow up with a father so he took his cues from reading and watching actors play fathers on TV.</p>
<p>“I had people who kind of played that role for me,” he said. “I want to break that cycle and do the opposite, be there as much as I can.”</p>
<p>He said he expects to work from home for the foreseeable future “until there is a vaccine. I have a compromised immune system because of a history with cancer. I can do enough virtually with clients.”</p>
<p>Before the shutdown, when libraries were open, his family often visited the Dormont Library.&nbsp;“She didn’t understand why we couldn’t go anymore, and she cried. We couldn’t explain it to her.”</p>
<p>He described his daughter as “a really cool, smart, energetic child. It’s easy to be around her. You want to be around her. It’s been the best part of my life.”</p>
<p><strong>Phil Haddad</strong></p>
<p>When COVID-19 precautions began in mid-March, Phil Haddad was able to work from home in Brookline, building software for Dick’s Sporting Goods. He was furloughed for about 6 weeks but has since returned to work.</p>
<p>Without a 30- to 60-minute commute to Coraopolis, he expected to have extra time to relax. Wrong.</p>
<p>Almost 2-year-old Nora and Hazel, 6 months, keep him and his wife Jesse busy. “Even before the COVID shutdown, you’re kind of accountable to nap times,” he said, laughing.</p>
<p>The days settled into a routine, and he took household cues from his wife.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been super-respectful and aware of how much work it takes to be a stay-at-home [parent]. Spending this time, actually being at home, it brings a whole new level of respect.”</p>
<p>The Haddad children are too young to grasp what has changed in the world, but watching them grow has been a revelation, he said.</p>
<p>“Kids 2 and under, they change so quickly and learn so much. For me, it’s realizing ‘Oh, all of a sudden, she is able to pick out a certain book when you ask her for it.’”</p>
<p>Family has helped put some things into perspective, he added. He’d rather be stuck at home with children than without.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to look at our friends who don’t have kids and you think, ‘Oh my gosh, it would be so great to just kind of do what we want, play some games, watch TV or do your own thing.’</p>
<p>“But this has kind of helped keep us sane because you have to stick to some sort of schedule and you have someone constantly demanding your attention.”</p>
<p>“For as much work as [kids] are, it’s really rewarding. And fun, too.”</p>
