<h1>Pirates' Colin Moran, Kevin Newman leave Sunday's game with injuries</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The injury bug continues to be contagious for the Pirates this season.</p>
<p>Though they have suffered a large number of bumps and bruises, a vast majority of them had been to pitchers to this point. On Sunday, against the Milwaukee Brewers, they took some hits on the offensive side of the ball.</p>
<p>On the first at-bat of the game, Brewers center fielder Avisail Garcia grounded a ball down the third-base line. Erik Gonzalez picked it, but his throw pulled first baseman Colin Moran off the bag and into the path of Garcia. The two collided heavily, and though Moran stayed in the game through the second inning, he was replaced in the lineup by Cole Tucker in the third. It was later announced that Moran was being evaluated for a concussion that he may have suffered during that collision.</p>
<p>Then, in the bottom of the third, shortstop Kevin Newman struck out swinging against Brewers pitcher Corbin Burnes and seemed to grimace a bit as he did so. Sure enough, when the Pirates took the field in the top of the fourth, Newman did not join them. He was replaced in the lineup by infielder JT Riddle, as the official update on Newman is that he was removed with right lower abdominal muscle discomfort.</p>
<p>If Moran and Newman have to spend any time on the injured list, it would add to an already crowded group of players the Pirates have sent there this season. Right now, they have 12 players on the IL, including eight on the 45-day injured list and four on the 10-day.</p>
<p>What’s more is that Newman and Moran were each swinging a hot bat of late. Newman recently had his nine-game hitting broken up, which brought his season batting average up more than 100 points from where it was. Moran had three doubles in Saturday’s game alone and is still the team leader in home runs after his torrid start to the season.</p>
<p>The recent success for each of them coincided with a bit of an awakening for the Pirates’ offense on the whole, as they scored seven and 12 runs, respectively, against the Brewers on Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>Now, if they hope to continue that miniature hot streak into upcoming games, they may have to do so without two of their hottest hitters in Newman and Moran.</p>
