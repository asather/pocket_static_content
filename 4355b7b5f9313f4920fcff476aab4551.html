<h1>Zach Aston-Reese plans to come back strong to help Penguins' playoff push</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Zach Aston-Reese knew it was coming Wednesday.</p>
<p>The winger, who has been sidelined since Feb. 16 with a lower-body injury, met the Penguins in Columbus and on Wednesday took the ice with his teammates at Nationwide Arena. Aston-Reese practiced without contact restrictions.</p>
<p>Afterward, he smirked while waiting for the first question asked when an injured player rejoins practice. So, how does it feel to be back out there with the guys?</p>
<p>“It feels good. I know this feeling all too well,” he said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>Aston-Reese has been dogged by injuries throughout his first three seasons in the NHL. Last season, he twice missed a bunch of games due to injuries. The latter of the two, a broken hand, sidelined him until the first round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>He was also knocked out of the 2018 playoffs when Washington Capitals forward Tom Wilson earned a suspension for breaking his jaw with an illegal hit.</p>
<p>Each time in the past, Aston-Reese, at his best a physical forward who mucks it up along the boards and in front of the other team’s goalie, wasn’t the same player when he returned to the lineup. It took time to get back into a groove.</p>
<p>This time around, Aston-Reese believes he will pick up where he left off when he does return to the lineup. He was noncommittal about whether that will happen Thursday, when the Penguins visit the Blue Jackets here in Columbus.</p>
<p>“I feel pretty confident. It’s a little different from last year’s injury. I thought I got on the ice a lot quicker this time,” he said. “I’ve been working with [skills development coach Ty Hennes] pretty hard and with [strength and conditioning coach Alex Trinca] in the weight room. We’ve been hitting it pretty hard.”</p>
<p>Aston-Reese said he “didn’t expect to be this far along yet” in his recovery. But he feels he learned valuable lessons last season about coming back from injury.</p>
<p>“You really can’t go lightly in the weight room,” he said. “Last year, I had to come back right before playoffs and it was just another gear. I don’t think I was fully prepared for that. This time around, just having conversations with the trainers and Ty, I was just trying to push myself every day as hard as I could.”</p>
<p>One of his goals this season was to play all 82 games. He made it 57 before going down against the Detroit Red Wings. At that point, Aston-Reese, who has six goals and 13 points, was one of only few Penguins who had not missed a game.</p>
<p>Now, his focus is being the same player the Penguins had been leaning on, when he was a key cog on a checking line with Teddy Blueger and Brandon Tanev.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday’s game on as planned</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins on Wednesday released a statement that read that they are “aware of the most recent guidance and recommendations from the Allegheny County Health Department” and that their next home game at PPG Paints Arena, Sunday against the New York Islanders, will go on as scheduled in front of fans.</p>
<p>The Penguins said that in response to “growing awareness and concern” over COVID-19, elevated safety procedures will be implemented. They include sanitary gloves worn by food handlers, ticket takers, ushers and suite attendants; cleaning and sanitizing of public areas; and hand sanitizers placed around the arena.</p>
<p>The team’s statement added: “As a reminder, guests who are feeling sick; who have traveled to or have been in contact with travelers to high risk areas; or who have serious underlying health issues, such as respiratory or cardiac conditions, should not attend events at PPG Paints Arena until further notice.”</p>
<p>The Penguins said they will remain in regular contact with health agencies, the NHL and other authorities for continued advice and direction, and any additional information that becomes available will be communicated to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Sullivan and Letang talk it out</strong></p>
<p>After Kris Letang took a retaliatory penalty in the third period of Tuesday’s 5-2 win in New Jersey, which forced the Penguins to kill a 5-on-3 power play to preserve their lead, coach Mike Sullivan said he would have a chat with the All-Star.</p>
<p>A day later, Sullivan said the two had indeed talked. It didn’t last long.</p>
<p>“I really didn’t have to say a lot to Tanger today,” Sullivan said after practice. “He took responsibility. He took ownership. He knows that he has to make a better decision in that situation. We’ll move by it and move on to the next game.”</p>
<p>Sullivan hopes Letang “learns from that lesson and it doesn’t happen again.”</p>
<p>Letang told reporters after practice that “you don’t want to take a penalty there.” The blue-liner added he was “pretty happy that we were able to kill that 5-on-3.”</p>
<p><strong>Sullivan encouraged by win</strong></p>
<p>Sullivan was satisfied with how the Penguins played in the win over the Devils. He specifically cited them “simplifying the game and playing as a group of five.”</p>
<p>“I thought we did a better job in all three zones,” Sullivan said Wednesday. “We helped each other on the breakouts; we got out of our end more efficiently. I thought we played quicker through the neutral zone, which allowed us to get more offensive zone time. We were willing to play behind their defensemen.”</p>
<p>The coach added: “We weren’t looking for the better play. We were taking the simple play that was there and playing straight-ahead. That’s when our team is at its best. ... We’ve just got to continue to build on that momentum.”</p>
