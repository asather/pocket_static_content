<h1>New North Park cafe will be a stop for runners, bikers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Runners and cyclists who enjoy <a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/parks/north-park/index.aspx" target="_blank">North Park</a>&nbsp;will soon have a new place to get a hot cup of coffee before making their five-mile loop around the lake — or a cold beer afterward.</p>
<p>Owner&nbsp;Craig Cozza gave a preview Wednesday of&nbsp;<a href="https://probikerun.com/" target="_blank">Pro Bike+Run’</a>s Cadence Cafe to a group of Honeycomb investors. The cafe in McCandless is expected to open to the public next month.</p>
<p>The shop and cafe on the ground floor of the 1-year-old store on Kummer Road will offer gear plus a coffee bar outfitted with a high-tech <a href="https://modbar.com/" target="_blank">&nbsp;Modbar espresso system</a>&nbsp;that serves hot and cold-brewed Mechanic Coffee from Verona and a juice and smoothie bar managed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.saludjuicery.com/" target="_blank">Salud Juicery</a>.</p>
<p>Along with grab-and-go food items and sandwiches, there will be a farmers market with seasonal produce, honey and eggs from local farms. Customers can take with or eat at a large seating area with Amish-made tables and benches.</p>
<p>Just as enticing is the wraparound bar with room for 20 people and 20 taps serving local and national craft beer.&nbsp;There also will be a gathering space below the store with a bar for private parties, barbecues and food truck events.</p>
<p>When it opened in December 2018, the sprawling&nbsp;7,000-square-foot barn became the bike and running store’s fifth and largest location. An even larger store is set to open later this year in the Strip District.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In creating the cafe space, Mr. Cozza said he hoped to create and foster a community of people who are interested in a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cafe was funded in part by a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2019/09/15/Small-businesses-high-interest-lenders-merchant-cash-advances-bank-loans-refinance/stories/201909150025" target="_blank">Honeycomb Credit</a> campaign that raised $24,250 from 78 investors. By relying on customers, friends and family for support, Honeycomb offers a crowdfunding alternative to bank loans for homegrown businesses.</p>
