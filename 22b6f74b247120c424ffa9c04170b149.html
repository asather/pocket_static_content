<h1>Jason Mackey: Seven-inning doubleheaders an MLB rule change worth keeping</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s not often you have the opportunity to link Plato and Major League Baseball, but the necessity of seven-inning doubleheaders due to COVID-19 and postponed games invented a uniquely watchable brand of baseball.</p>
<p>Not to overdo and beat into the ground, of course, but here’s hoping that MLB considers keeping the doubleheader option open for next season, either as a way to avoid lengthy rain delays or create extra days off.</p>
<p>It could also serve as a goodwill gesture toward fans who have missed the sport this season, allowing them to pay once to enter the ballpark and watch at least 14 innings of baseball, although it also stands to reason that owners who’ve missed out on gate-related revenue this season might not be totally OK with the idea.</p>
<p>But from a pure entertainment standpoint, these games have been much better than expected. Their pace has been swift, with games regularly ending inside of 2 1/2 hours, while the best of them have skewed toward 2 hours.</p>
<p>“The doubleheader thing, I really like,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said Friday before his team started a pair of games against the Cardinals at PNC Park. “I like the seven-inning doubleheader. I think in terms of pitcher use and the amount of innings that are thrown and how it goes and everything, I’m a big fan of the seven-inning doubleheaders.”</p>
<p>The doubleheaders have also provided an opportunity for a 29th man this season. Normally that’s been Cody Ponce, who has started in them twice, though for Friday’s two-game set against the Cardinals it’s Jason Martin who’ll get the nod.</p>
<p>More opportunity for younger players should never been seen as a bad thing.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t burn pitching as much as originally thought. If starters can go five or six innings, the bullpen is left to cover one or two — or two to four innings over the balance of the day, the same as it normally would, with a theoretical day off as a result.</p>
<p>By embracing the doubleheader, baseball could even get a little more creative with its season structure. Perhaps opening day could shift back to early April instead of March, as it has seemingly crept earlier and earlier each year.</p>
<p>They could also strategically place doubleheaders to afford teams extra time off in the dog days of summer, playing more games in April, May and June and perhaps offering additional breaks in July or August.</p>
<p>Bottom line, we entered this season thinking of seven-inning doubleheaders as a gimmick. To anyone who has watched them, they’ve been markedly better than that.</p>
<p>It’s also not the only rule baseball must consider keeping.</p>
<p>MLB will also need to address the designated hitter, which it used because of the shortened ramp-up in spring training 2.0, trying to keep pitchers healthy.</p>
<p>As the league tries to ensure that its product is more watchable and relatable to a younger generation, it’s a fair assumption that the idea of keeping the DH will be given serious thought this offseason.</p>
<p>“The DH was something I was used to, so I really don’t know any different,” Shelton said. “That’s probably going to be the one that’s most debated if they bring it back or not. I don’t know on that one. I’m comfortable with it. It’s fine.”</p>
<p>The other rule change MLB implemented this season involves starting extra innings with a runner on second base, the idea being to reduce super long games and prevent players from prolonged exposure to one another. That, too, may be something worth keeping around in normal times.</p>
<p>Shelton said he liked the spirit of the rule — to eliminate games going 17, 18 or 19 innings — but thought there might be a middle ground worth pursuing.</p>
<p>One suggestion made to Shelton was possibly playing one or two normal extra innings, then shifting to the runner-on-second model.</p>
<p>“I think that’s an interesting way to go about it,” Shelton said. “You play the 10th and the 11th straight-up, then you go to it. What happens is, especially with a 26-man roster, you end up optioning guys out that shouldn’t get optioned out because they’ve thrown. Guys ended up being lost because of the fact that they’ve done something really well, but you need somebody for the next day.</p>
<p>“That’s an interesting concept. … I will definitely steal that for the next managers’ meeting and throw that out.”</p>
