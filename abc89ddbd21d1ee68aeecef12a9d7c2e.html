<p>A class action lawsuit against Chipotle Mexican Grill alleges the restaurants’ cashiers are refusing to give change to customers.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in Allegheny County Common Pleas court, states that a plaintiff on Tuesday went to a Chipotle location along William Flynn Highway in Allison Park and used a $20 bill to pay for a purchase of $15.51.</p>
<p>She received only $4 in return, even though the receipt displayed change as $4.49.</p>
<p>Another plaintiff last week used a $20 bill at a location along Perry Highway in Wexford received $11 change instead of $11.28, the complaint reads.</p>
<p>“This&nbsp;‘company policy’ not only discriminates against people who do not have, or do not wish to use, credit cards, but also results in a tax-free cash windfall to Chipotle,” the suit reads.</p>
<p>In a written statement, Chipotle Chief Corporate Affairs and Food Safety Officer Laurie Schalow said, “If a restaurant is low on change as a result of the nationwide coin shortage, our policy is to only accept exact change or other non-cash forms of payment.</p>
<p>“Restaurants that are impacted have signage posted on the door as well as inside, and employees have been instructed to alert guests prior to ordering. We encourage customers to contact us immediately with any concerns so we can investigate and respond quickly to make things right.”</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve announced in June that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/07/18/coin-shortage-affecting-businesses/stories/202007160145" target="_blank">coin distribution is being rationed</a> due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing dropping coin deposits and production rates.</p>
<p>Ms. Schalow’s statement is not representative of what has been happening to customers in Pennsylvania, said attorney Frank G. Salpietro, who is representing the plaintiffs. He said the issue of signage doesn’t justify shortchanging customers. “If someone tells you, ‘I’m gonna steal from you,’ and they steal from you, that didn’t get them off the hook.”</p>
<p>Mr. Salpietro said he knows of at least five stores that he believes have intentionally shortchanged customers.</p>
<p>The complaint against Chipotle accuses the company of misappropriation and conversion, unfair trade practices, breach of contract and injunction. The suit alleges the company has misappropriated a believed several hundred thousand dollars at minimum.</p>
<p>It is believed “that Chipotle knowingly and deliberately imposed the above-referenced policy of shortchanging and penalizing consumers who needed or wanted to purchase Defendant’s goods and services with cash,” the suit states.</p>
<p>The complaint asks the court to enjoin Chipotle to issue credit to people who can only pay with cash and will not receive exact change.</p>
<p>“This ‘company policy’ and refusal of Defendant Chipotle to provide either change or a credit to consumers is believed … to have resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, to the detriment of Pennsylvania consumers and to the benefit of Defendant Chipotle.”</p>
<p>Mr. Salpietro is requesting a jury trial.</p>
