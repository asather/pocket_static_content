<p>Millions of Americans will soon receive their coronavirus stimulus funds via a debit card.</p>
<p>The IRS and U.S. Treasury announced Monday they will send nearly 4 million Economic Impact Payments – the formal name for the stimulus funds – via prepaid debit cards instead of by paper check or direct deposit.</p>
<p>The cards are being sent to individuals who are qualified for the stimulus funds but don’t have bank information on file with the IRS. The debit cards will be quicker than distributing paper checks, according to officials.</p>

<p>“Treasury and the IRS have been working with unprecedented speed to issue Economic Impact Payments to American families. Prepaid debit cards are secure, easy to use, and allow us to deliver Americans their money quickly,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. “Recipients can immediately activate and use the cards safely.”</p>
<p>The card will allow users to make purchases, get cash from in-network ATMs and transfer the funds to their personal bank accounts without additional fees. Users will also be able to check their card balance online, via a mobile app or by phone. The card can be used online, at ATMs or any retail location where Visa is accepted.</p>
<p>More than 140 million stimulus fund payments worth $239 billion have been distributed.</p>
<p>The stimulus provides up to $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for married couples and $500 per child.</p>
<p>Treasury’s financial agent, MetaBank, will begin mailing the cards this week to individuals who qualify for the stimulus payment but do not have bank information on file with the IRS, and whose tax return was processed by either the Andover or Austin IRS Service Center, the Treasury news release said.</p>
