<p>Among the 43 new cases in Allegheny County, 33 are confirmed from 803 tests. Ten are probable cases, with one being from an antigen test. These positive cases are from tests that were taken between Sept. 1 and Oct. 6, though the county health department says the majority of the positive cases are from tests that were taken within the last week.</p>
<p>Those who have recently tested positive range in age from eight months to 70 years old, with a median age of 26.</p>
<p>Allegheny County has now had a total of 12,897 cases of the virus since the beginning of the pandemic in mid-March.</p>

<p>Wednesday’s case count increase of 43 new cases is the lowest single-day increase the county has had this month.</p>
<p>Among the 28 new deaths throughout the state, eight are within the Pittsburgh region. Beaver County reported two new deaths, and Clearfield, Forest and Lawrence counties reported one death each. This is the first reported death in Forest County.</p>
<p>The state is also reporting three additional deaths in Allegheny County, but has been reporting a number different from county officials. Based on data from the county health department, there have been 393 COVID-19 related deaths in Allegheny.</p>
<p>The three new county deaths occurred between Sept. 26 and Oct. 2. They were among two people in their 60s and one in their 80s. One death is associated with a long-term care facility.</p>
