<h1>2020 August Wilson Society conference postponed due to COVID-19 concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The August Wilson Society gathering scheduled for next week in Pittsburgh has been postponed "in response to concerns and uncertainty" about COVID-19.</p>
<p>The national organization's biennial colloquium, which was set to bring in panelists from throughout the country, had been scheduled for Friday through Sunday at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center.</p>
<p>The registration page at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2020-august-wilson-society-biennial-colloquium-postponed-registration-76659016181" target="_blank">eventbrite.com</a> now has a banner across it that reads: "Event Postponed," with a letter from Khalid Y. Long, vice president of the society and the event planner. It details how to cancel reservations here and also that the society is "exploring options" for rescheduling the colloquium in the fall.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker during Saturday’s sessions was to have been actress Michele Shay, a Tony Award nominee for her role as Louise in Wilson’s “Seven Guitars,” one of 10 plays -— nine set in the Hill District -—&nbsp;by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright.</p>

<p>Also postponed is Pittsburgh actor Wali Jamal's performance in Wilson’s autobiographical play, “How I Learned What I Learned" that had been scheduled for Friday at 8 p.m. Jamal, a Post-Gazette Performer of the Year, is the only actor to have performed in all of Wilson’s American Century Cycle plays, plus this solo show.</p>
<p>The postponement of the conference will not affect other programming at the August Wilson Center, said spokeswoman Cydney Nunn. On Monday night, Tarana Burke, who launched the #MeToo movement and is senior director of Girls for Gender Equity in Brooklyn, is the guest speaker for the center's TRUTHSayers series.</p>
<p>The August Wilson Society, which previously held its colloquium here in 2018, is&nbsp;“dedicated to commemorating August Wilson’s legacy … and ultimately the safeguarding of the rich narrative of the African American past that Wilson has bequeathed to us” in his American Century Cycle of plays.</p>
