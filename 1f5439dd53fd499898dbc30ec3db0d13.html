<h1>Steelers mailbag: Ryan Switzer didn't shy away from expectations — or criticism</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Brian Batko’s offseason-occasional Steelers mailbag. You’re more than welcome to email him at bbatko@post-gazette.com, tweet him @BrianBatko or slide into his DMs to inquire about the Steelers, NFL or anything out of bounds. </em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started, and don’t forget to join us on our all-sports podcast, <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="_blank">The North Shore Drive</a>, whether you use Apple, Spotify or any of the other major podcasting platforms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Not necessarily a question here from my follower Mr. Doug, but then again, most of the replies to my Monday tweet regarding Ryan Switzer were comments. Comments like this one, incredulous that Switzer would say some of the things he did during an Instagram Live session with fans, which precisely one sports writer happened to watch.</p>
<p>Here is the full quote that has been blowing up my Twitter mentions for two days now: “I believe I will be one of the best slot receivers in the NFL. I unequivocally believe that, given my opportunity. When my opportunity meets the preparation I’ve put in, I have no doubt I’ll be up there and I’ll be talked about like [Julian] Edelman is, like [Wes] Welker was, like Jamison Crowder is, Cole Beasley — a guy I played with in Dallas. I have no doubt that when my opportunity meets my preparation, I’ll be there.”</p>
<p>So, yeah, that sure is a lot of confidence from Switzer. But he’s also well aware of how unproductive he was in 2019, which is why he has spent this offseason getting his “mojo back.” According to the 5-foot-8 Switzer, he weighs 177 pounds but is currently maxing out at 305 pounds on the bench press and clocked in around 21 miles per hour on his most recent speed test, though he hopes to hit 22 on his next one.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I’ve just been working,” Switzer said. “It’s all I’ve ever done, but more so this season because of the backlash and the scrutiny and the criticizing that I took. I really took it to heart. They say business isn't personal, but it is. It certainly is to me. I’ve never really used criticism as fuel, because I haven’t really gotten any before, so we’ll see if I can turn that into production, which I believe, wholeheartedly, that I will.”</p>
<p>Switzer, who turns 26 in November and became a father two months ago, added that “as bad as last year was and as down as I was, I’m just so excited to get back.” He caught just eight passes for 29 yards before his season ended with a back injury in Week 10.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life, Switzer told 100-some viewers, he feels that people are counting him out. He even addressed some of the public doubting and, well, harsh remarks he often faces on social media.</p>
<p>“What I don't get is the random people who don't do their research, who don't watch tape,” Switzer said. “In the minimal snaps that I got last year, there was a lot of film where had one or two things gone my way, my whole season could’ve been different. But, again, all that’s in the past. I’ve forgotten completely about last season and I’m so excited to be a part of what I think is a championship team.”</p>
<p>Even during the impromptu Q&amp;A, with his wife and 2-month-old son nearby, Switzer had at least one follower ask if he’s “going to run the ball or keep kneeling,” a reference to his 11 fair catches on 19 punt return opportunities in 2019.</p>
<p>“Oh, man, Kevin, how little you know about the game of football. … Gosh, the stupidity and people who don't understand the game,” Switzer lamented. “It’s a shame, because I take the brunt of it, but it’s whatever.”</p>
<p>Switzer touched on a number of other topics, including reconciling his desire to play this season with his concern for his family’s health and safety, and how he's been “throwing a ton this offseason” with Ben Roethlisberger. But given the nature of live Instagram video, there’s no replay to be found anywhere online.</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well, my idea of an 80-man training camp roster projection was a joke, but hey, what is the Steelers mailbag for if not this sort of minutiae? Chris is assuming that when it comes time for the Steelers to terminate 10 of the players they carried all offseason, most will come from that no man’s land in between undrafted free agents and 2019 incumbents.</p>
<p>That’s probably not a bad guess. What we’re basically trying to do here is figure out the 10 guys least likely to make the team, so logically, you’d start by looking at the last guys signed to fill out roster spots before the draft. That would be two offensive linemen, Anthony Coyle and John Keenoy, and two cornerbacks, Breon Borders and Arrion Springs, all four of whom came from the XFL ranks and play positions with a mix of veterans and youth in front of them.</p>
<p>Outside linebacker is another spot without much to figure out in camp, so that doesn't bode well for local college alumni DeWayne Hendrix (Pitt) and Christian Kuntz (Duquesne). You probably don't need five quarterbacks, and J.T. Barrett is the clear low man on that totem pole. All undrafted rookies face long odds, but none longer than fullback Spencer Nigh behind Derek Watt. Ralph Webb was in camp last year and finished 2019 on the practice squad, but then the team drafted Anthony McFarland to make a crowded backfield even more so. And again, there won't be a preseason and thus no late-game carries or returns to dish out, which could be bad news for Pitt grad Quadree Henderson in a wide receiver room that’s fairly cut and dried.</p>
<p>How’s that for paring down a theoretical roster for a training camp that may or may not start soon? Not that it’s fun to speculate on the job status of roster hopefuls, but hey, like Switzer said, it’s nothing personal.</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville:</strong> I find it frustrating that the NFL players decided to negotiate through the media. Baseball did the same thing and now so many of us have a bad taste in our mouths. I was so excited about the upcoming season (If it happens) and now between this and what promises to be a political campaign as much as a normal season, I’m already just about done. What are your thoughts, Brian?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> My thoughts are that George Atallah, the NFLPA’s assistant executive director of external affairs, hit the nail on the head with a few tweets Monday night.</p>
<p>No need to have a bad taste in your mouth, Alan. As has become the theme of this mailbag, it’s strictly business. And for as many football fans around the country who might be feeling the same way now, the guess here is that all that bitterness will quickly dissipate if and when the first ball is kicked off on a Thursday night, Sunday afternoon or Monday evening.</p>
