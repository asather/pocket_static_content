<h1>State Rep. Metcalfe calls for rollback and repeal of environmental regulations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>State Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, has asked the state Department of Environmental Protection to stop enforcement and identify which regulations it intends to “roll back or repeal” to help businesses quickly recover from closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr. Metcalfe, R-Cranberry, a long-time opponent of environmental regulations, made the request in an April 14 letter to state Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Patrick McDonnell that also demanded the department suspend plans to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</p>
<p>In the letter, Mr. Metcalfe, the chairman of the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, states that when the novel coronavirus is “contained,” the DEP must take “drastic steps” to encourage economic growth.</p>
<p>“Any regulation that will harm this recovery effort must be reformed or removed,” Mr. Metcalfe wrote. “Any delay by DEP in processing permits will harm this recovery effort and is thus entirely unacceptable.”</p>
<p>The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a consortium of 10 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states formed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and generate economic growth. An executive order by Gov. Tom Wolf in October 2019 directed the DEP to begin writing regulations for participation in the regional program.</p>
<p>Mr. Metcalfe and other critics have said the initiative will hurt the economy, cause coal-fired power plants to close and increase electricity costs in a state that is the second biggest producer of natural gas in the nation and the leading eclectic power exporter in the region.</p>
<p>The letter, posted on Mr. Metcalfe’s House of Representatives home page, calls on the DEP to follow the lead of the U.S. Environmental Protection, which, in a March memorandum, said it would not bring enforcement actions for violations of monitoring, testing, sampling and reporting requirements if the agency agrees that COVID-19 related factors caused the non-compliance and the regulated entity provides documentation.</p>
<p>A DEP directive, issued a week after the EPA’s policy, states that businesses and industries could request temporary suspensions of regulatory requirements and permit conditions “by emailing a form to the department.”</p>
<p>Mr. Metcalfe wrote that the DEP response is “entirely inadequate,” saying, among other criticisms, that “there is no indication that you will be using this effort to grant the business community the relief it desperately needs.”</p>
<p>The DEP did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.</p>
