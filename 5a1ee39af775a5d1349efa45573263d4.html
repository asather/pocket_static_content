<h1>State appoints manager for troubled Beaver County nursing home</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Though the Pennsylvania Department of Health officially said it found no “red flags” about how a Beaver County nursing home responded to the massive COVID-19 outbreak there that has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/28/Disturbing-events-at-Beaver-County-nursing-home-as-COVID-19-deaths-rise-to-52/stories/202004280137?cid=search" target="_blank">led to the deaths of at least 58 residents</a>, two weeks ago the state quietly — without public notice — took the extraordinary step of appointing a private manager to run the nursing home.</p>
<p>The manager, The Long Hill Co., of Shelton, Conn., was appointed by the state under agreement with Comprehensive Healthcare, the owners of the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center nursing home, on April 15.</p>
<p>But that was not publicly known until Wednesday when Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said the state had installed a temporary manager “to help the facility,” though exactly what it is doing at the nursing home is not clear.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Department spokesman Nate Wardle said in a news release that the state did not announce the appointment when it was made April 15 because its “focus has been on working to assist facilities in need amidst COVID-19. The majority of the press releases from our office have been the daily updates, save for a few other COVID-19 announcements.”</p>
<p>This is the first time the state has taken such action with any facility during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2019/07/03/hahnemann-st-christophers-hospital-oversight.html" target="_blank">first time since it appointed a manager last year</a>&nbsp;to Hahnemann University Hospital — which closed — and St. Christopher’s Children’s Hospital, which was going through bankruptcy. Both had the same owner.</p>
<p><a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-35-ps-health-and-safety/pa-st-sect-35-448-814.html" target="_blank">The statute the state cited as giving it the authority</a> to appoint a manager of Brighton Rehabilitation says such an appointment is done “[w]hen the health care provider has failed to bring the facility into compliance within the time specified by the department, or when the facility has demonstrated that it is unwilling or unable to achieve compliance, such as would convince a reasonable person that any correction of violations would be unlikely to be maintained.”</p>
<p>Brighton Rehabilitation has faced a litany of poor state inspections over the past two-plus years, in particular because of a scabies outbreak that occurred there among residents last year.</p>
<p>But it had problems even before that, which placed it on the federal government’s Special Focus Facility candidates list in January 2018, as among the worst-run nursing homes in the country. Though facilities can improve and leave that list, Brighton Rehabilitation has remained on the list for 28 straight months, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/sff-posting-candidate-list-april-2020.pdf-0" target="_blank">according to an April 28 update by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the scabies outbreak, state records show Brighton Rehabilitation has been fined five times for serious violations over the past two years for a total of $60,500 in fines, including findings in March 2017 that six residents had bed sores ($21,000 fine); a finding in July 2017 that one resident broke an arm falling off an air mattress ($9,750); a finding in April 2018 that a staff member applied a warm compress that resulted in burns to a resident ($8,250); a finding in January 2019 that heat was out for more than a day in three residents units and 87 residents had to be relocated ($16,750); and an August 2019 finding that a resident broke a humerus after falling out of bed ($4,750).</p>
<p>The heat failure in 2019 resulted not only in a fine, but also in having the facility put on a “Provisional 1” license, which requires additional inspections every year by the state. The incident of the resident breaking a humerus bone in August resulted in the facility being put into a higher category, Provisional 2 license, meaning even more inspections. If the facility gets to a Provisional 4 license, it can then be closed by the state for cause, though that rarely occurs.</p>
<p>According to the statute the state cited in appointing the manager, the goal of appointing a manager by the state, which is paid for by the nursing home, should be for one of two reasons, either “to assure the health and safety of the facility’s patients or residents until improvements are made to bring the facility into compliance with the laws and regulations for licensure or until there is an orderly closure of the facility.”</p>
<p>Asked Thursday which part of the statute gave the state the power to appoint a manager at Brighton Rehabilitation, Mr. Wardle responded in an email: “In this extraordinary time, the temporary manager provides support and oversight of operations at the facility.”</p>
<p>Dr. Levine said during her online news conference Thursday that the manager was appointed “to help us and help the staff there in terms of their taking care of patients, and preventing further patients from getting COVID-19, and taking care of the patients that do.”</p>
<p>In response to questions, The Long Hill Co. said in an emailed statement: “The Long Hill Company was recently retained as a consultant to provide a limited review of the practices and protocols of Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County, PA. The Long Hill Company is not managing, operating or surveying the facility. Inquiries relating to the operations of the facility should be made to the management of Brighton.”</p>
<p>Questions sent Thursday to the nursing home’s owner, Comprehensive Healthcare, were not answered Thursday.</p>
<p>The Long Hill Co. is part of a larger health care organization, United Methodist Homes, known as UMH Inc. UMH has been around since 1874 and it created Long Hill in 1998.</p>
<p>On its website, Long Hill, a for-profit company that owns and manages nursing homes, said it has served over 39 affiliates in 11 states with a combined annual budget over $200 million, and it cares for more than 3,000 seniors.</p>
<p>It has a team of clinical, financial and management professionals who specialize in “the turnaround of distressed health care organizations” that “create value by stabilizing volatile situations,” according to its website.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, who represents Beaver County, held a telephone town hall Thursday afternoon focused on the outbreak at Brighton Rehabilitation, with questions from constituents about what is happening at the nursing home and what is being done to help residents and staff there.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb said at the outset of the town hall that the “horrible tragedy” was compounded by the fact that “[m]ost of these people were members of the Greatest Generation and the last thing they deserved was to suffer this way at the end of their lives.”</p>
<p>Beaver County Commissioner Daniel Camp, a Republican, joined the call with Mr. Lamb, and he said the increasing death toll at Brighton Rehabilitation has put a “spotlight” on the county.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/faces-of-covid-19/" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/04/15/faces-of-covid-19-stories-behind-local-lives-lost" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>After the call, Mr. Lamb said in an interview that he “was very happy to hear [the state] take that step” of appointing a manager.</p>
<p>“My take on it was that that place needs all the help it can get,” he said.</p>
