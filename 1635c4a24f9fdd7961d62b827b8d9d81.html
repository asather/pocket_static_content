<h1>North Catholic claims fourth consecutive WPIAL 4A title with win versus Southmoreland</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Based on the traditions of the two programs, the WPIAL Class 4A girls championship Friday night at Petersen Events Center was about as close as it gets to a David vs. Goliath matchup in high school basketball.</p>
<p>Based on the records of the two teams, it was more like Goliath vs. Goliath.</p>
<p>In the end, North Catholic (24-1) reinforced its standing as arguably the premier girls basketball program in the area by capturing yet another WPIAL title. The top-seeded Trojanettes controlled their showdown with No. 2 Southmoreland (24-1) from start to finish, putting an end to the Scotties’ perfect season with an impressive 61-44 win.</p>
<p>The win gave North Catholic its fourth consecutive WPIAL championship and 20th overall, extending its WPIAL record. Meanwhile, Trojanettes coach Molly Rottman moved into second place all time with her ninth WPIAL title as a head coach.</p>
<p>Southmoreland, meanwhile, was playing in a WPIAL championship for the first time in school history.</p>
<p>“We came in with a good game plan,” Rottman said. “I felt very confident. I have nine seniors. Most of them, it’s their fourth time there. We’ve been talking about this.</p>
<p>“We didn’t talk about the fourth [consecutive title], but you want to go out with every win you can, and I think they came ready to do that today.”</p>
<p>As has been the case all season, North Catholic relied on its trio of standout seniors to get the job done. Emma Pospisil led the way with 18 points on 7-of-9 shooting, while Kylee Lewandowski scored 14 and Tess Myers finished with 13 for the Trojanettes.</p>
<p>Myers, a Duquesne recruit, is the only player on the team to have started in each of the past four WPIAL championships.</p>
<p>“It’s really awesome, but I’ve done it with all of them,” Myers said. “We’ve been at it together since we were freshmen. It feels good.”</p>
<p>Sophomore guard/​forward Gracie Spadaro led the Scotties with 12 points, while freshman point guard Olivia Cernuto finished with 10 in the defeat.</p>
<p>North Catholic shot 48 percent from the field while converting 9 of 17 attempts from 3-point range. Southmoreland, meanwhile, shot just 16 of 57 from the field and 3 of 17 from beyond the arc.</p>
<p>“I thought we were getting good looks on the offensive end. We just weren’t getting the ball to fall,” Scotties coach Brian Pritts said. “[North Catholic] shot the ball extremely well tonight … it seemed like every time the ball left their hands, they were shooting with confidence.”</p>
<p>The Trojanettes opened up a 13-7 lead midway through the first quarter, and they kept control of the game until Southmoreland senior guard Charity Henderson drained a half-court shot as time expired in the first quarter. Henderson then opened the second quarter with a nice assist to fellow senior Erika Sherbondy to cut North Catholic’s lead to two at 19-17.</p>
<p>Pospisil answered with a 3-pointer, then she converted a layup to give North Catholic a 26-18 lead before a layup by Lewandowski stretched the Trojanettes’ lead to double digits.</p>
<p>Lewandowksi nailed two 3-pointers midway through the second quarter to extend North Catholic’s lead, then Pospisil followed with a fastbreak layup and a 3-pointer to give the Trojanettes a 42-26 lead at the half.</p>
<p>“We knew that this was our last time at the Pete [together], so we were all going to come together and win as a team,” said Lewandowski, a Richmond recruit. “I think we did that pretty well.”</p>
<p>North Catholic fell into a bit of a dry spell after the break, while the Scotties’ cold shooting night continued. Senior forward Sarah Pisula converted an and-one layup midway through the third quarter to give Southmoreland a temporary spark, but the Scotties were unable to put together an extended run.</p>
<p>Pospisil closed out the quarter with a buzzer-beating 3 from the top of the key to give the Trojanettes a 52-33 lead entering the final quarter. Southmoreland couldn’t string together enough shots to threaten a comeback in the fourth, and the Trojanettes cruised the rest of the way to their record 20th WPIAL girls basketball title.</p>
<p>“They’ve left an unbelievable legacy,” Rottman said.</p>
