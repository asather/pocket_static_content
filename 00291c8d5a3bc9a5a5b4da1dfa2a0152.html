<h1>Molly Smith Metzler takes an honest look at motherhood in 'Cry It Out' at City Theatre</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Cry It Out,” in the play by Molly Smith Metzler, refers to babies crying themselves to sleep, without parents running to the rescue. It may just as well refer to new mothers who are feeling alone and desperate and could use a friendly face now and then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tale of the latest Metzler play at City Theatre is filled with full-circle moments that trace back to its birth, as a commission by Mark Masterson, when he was artistic director at the Actors Theater of Louisville. Mr. Masterson produced “Elemeno Pea” there — a Metzler play that was done by City in 2015 -— then commissioned another work from the writer before moving to South Coast Rep. There were more twists and turns before&nbsp;“Cry It Out” premiered in Louisville.</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> City Theatre, 1300 Bingham St., South Side.</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Through March 22 (opens Friday, March 6). 7 p.m. Tuesday; 1 and/or 7 p.m Wednesday, 8 p.m. Thursday-Friday; 1 and 5:30 and/or 9 p.m.; and 2 or 7 p.m. Sunday (check citytheatrecompany.org).</p>
<p><strong>Tickets:</strong>&nbsp;$29-$75 (check online or call for 30 and younger and 62 and older discounts), citytheatrecompany.org or 412-431-2489.</p>
<p>“But I really have Mark to thank for the play, because it was his very early belief in me to give me that commission that made it happen, Ms. Metzler says.</p>
<p>Mr. Masterson returned to City Theatre in 2018, and&nbsp;“I’m so glad to be reunited with him,” Ms. Metzler said by phone from Los Angeles. “It’s been 10 years that he’s been rooting for me and commissioning me at his various homes. ... I’m very excited ‘Cry It Out’ is going to be in his theater while he’s there.”</p>
<p>In the past decade, Ms. Metzler has become a mother — daughter Cora is 7 — and the playwright also has been writing for television series such as Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black” and “Shameless” on Showtime. Upcoming is the <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/netflix-orders-female-driven-dramedy-series-maid-produced-john-wells-margot-robbie-1202790918/" target="_blank">Netflix project “Maid,” a “female-driven dramedy series” </a>on which she will be showrunner for producers John Wells and Margot Robbie.</p>
<p>She offers up the Pittsburgh connections in that sentence without a prompt: Mr. Wells attended Carnegie Mellon University with Mr. Masterson, and City’s director of “Cry It Out,” Kim Weild, is head of the John Wells Directing Program at the CMU School of Drama.</p>
<p>The fictional play coming to the South Side was inspired by motherhood and its many joys and traumas, some experienced and some observed by the writer.&nbsp;“Cry It Out” takes a turn, from what Metzler describes as&nbsp;“a funny, breast-milky comedy about friendship” to a deeper look at the socioeconomic impacts of becoming a parent.</p>
<p>Audience members may disagree about some choices, but they are likely to agree that each character has traits any parents will recognize.</p>
<p>Jessie is a corporate lawyer who had planned to return to work, but she is torn because of the special bond she feels with her daughter. While her husband commutes to work, she has been isolated as a newcomer to her Long Island town — until she begins a daily coffee klatch with neighbor Lina, a working mom who is living with her meddlesome mother-in-law. They become fast friends and confidantes, before Mitchell enters the yard. He has been watching them from his mansion on the hill overlooking their happy meetings, and begs them to include his wife, Adrienne.</p>
<p>Whatever these women thought motherhood would be like, no matter how well they may have planned for it — well, we all know reality trumps best-laid plans.</p>
<p>“There’s this odd conception in our culture that for a woman, you’re going to poop out a baby and go back to your life,” Ms. Metzler says. “And the fact is, you are not the same person ever again. Physically, emotionally, professionally, everything changes.&nbsp;People talk about the decision to go back to work as if it’s a feminist one — are you a worker bee, or are you Betty Crocker? It’s not.”</p>
<p>Ms. Metzler and her teacher husband decided together that she would be a stay-at-home mom while their daughter was a baby. He took on several additional jobs at school and they lived frugally until Ms. Metzler began writing again when Cora was 2 1/2.</p>
<p>“Cry It Out” makes a point of spotlighting women who are forced to return to work as a purely economic decision.&nbsp;One of the conflicts is a couple at odds over a proposed change in plans.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a very specific horror to realize you have a partner who doesn’t have the same vision as you, and you are backed into a corner that can’t change,” Ms. Metzler says.</p>
<p>For the first six months, the “unemployed playwright” lived in isolation — like Jessie in the play — before gaining insights and friends through a mom’s group.&nbsp;During all that time, Ms. Metzler was chronicling what she learned and observed. But when she started to write “Cry It Out,” she thought it would be just for her “mom friends,” and she didn’t expect the regional success that the play has become.</p>
<p>“I remember thinking, ‘Oh, absolutely no one is going to produce this. These are two women covered in breast milk on a lawn, talking about how hard this is, and I highly doubt anyone is going to find this stageworthy.’ What a marvelous, encouraging and wonderful surprise that so many theaters do find it stageworthy and important,” she says.</p>
<p>City Theatre brings Ms. Metzler’s play to the stage with Julianne Avolio and Tim McGeever (multiple Pittsburgh stages), Sarah Goeke (the first national tour of “Beautiful, the Carole King Musical”), and Rebecca Hirota (Quantum Theatre’s “36 Views”).</p>
<p>The playwright has a word for how she wants us to think of women who make it through the postpartum period: “survivors.”</p>
<p>“Cry It Out” has given those survivors the opportunity to talk openly and honestly about their experiences, which Ms. Metzler believes is why the play has had a larger audience than she ever anticipated.</p>
<p>“I wrote it because I was lonely,” she says, “and then found out I had friends all over the country going through the same thing.”</p>
