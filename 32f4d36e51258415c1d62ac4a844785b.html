<h1>Uniontown Hospital plans affiliation with WVU Health System</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Uniontown Hospital plans to join the 11-hospital West Virginia University Health System, officials at the Fayette County facility announced Monday.</p>
<p>Under the management agreement, which still requires regulatory approval, Uniontown Hospital would remain an acute care facility and hospital CEO Steve Handy will continue in that role, although as an employee of WVU Hospitals.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, Mr. Handy described the affiliation as “an opportunity to ensure exceptional care for our patients, to ensure that local healthcare remains available to all those who count on us, to continue to act as an economic driver and source for regional employment, and, ultimately, to continue to make a healthy difference in the lives we touch.”</p>
<p>Uniontown Hospital has 145 private patient rooms with more than 200 physicians and advanced practice providers trained in more than 30 medical specialties.</p>
<p>It is located about 30 miles north of WVU’s Morgantown headquarters versus 45 miles to Pittsburgh’s tertiary care hospitals.</p>
<p>“From a geographical standpoint, we are uniquely positioned to partner with Uniontown Hospital to provide world-class healthcare to the people of Fayette County,” said WVU Health System President and CEO Albert L. Wright Jr. in the release.</p>
<p>“The partnership also aligns with our mission to ensure that people do not have to travel great distances to find the care they need.”</p>
