<h1>Tuned In: Showtime’s ‘Rust’ will film in Pittsburgh region</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PASADENA, Calif. — Last week in between press conferences for Showtime series, Showtime CEO/CBS chief creative officer David Nevins said the intent was to film the premium cable network’s Western Pennsylvania-set “Rust” in Pittsburgh but a deal wasn’t yet done.</p>
<p>Now it is.</p>
<p>The 10-episode first season of Showtime’s “Rust” will begin production locally this spring. The Pittsburgh Film Office posted information on its website on crew hiring Monday.</p>
<p>Jeff Daniels (“The Newsroom”) stars in “Rust” as Del Harris, chief of police in a southwestern Pennsylvania rust belt town. When his girlfriend’s son is accused of murder, Harris must decide how far he will go to protect the accused.</p>
<p>“Rust” is based on author Philipp Meyer’s 2009 novel “American Rust,” set in the fictional Mon Valley town of Buell, Fayette County.</p>
<p>“We have worked on this project for a long time and it is wonderful to have them call southwestern Pennsylvania home this year,” said Pittsburgh Film Office director Dawn Keezer.</p>
<p>“The film industry continues to be a growing segment of Pennsylvania’s economy providing family-sustaining jobs and new revenue to the commonwealth. These projects are only made possible by the successful Film Tax Credit program. We are hopeful that the credit will be doubled in this next fiscal year, so that we can continue to see growth in this vital economic sector.”</p>
<p>“Rust” joins recent Pittsburgh-based TV productions “Manhunt: Deadly Games” (formerly “Manhunt: Lone Wolf”) and Netflix’s “I Am Not Okay With This.” The last TV series set-and-filmed in Western Pennsylvania, CBS All Access’ “One Dollar,” premiered in August 2018 and was canceled after one season.</p>
<p>“Rust” coming to town comes just a few days after news that Netflix’s “Mindhunter” is on indefinite hold for a third season after its cast was released from their contracts.</p>
<p>Showtime exec Mr. Nevins isn’t from Western Pennsylvania but he has a connection: His father, Louis Nevins, grew up in Kittanning, where his great-grandfather, also named Louis, opened The Arcade department store in the 1800s. The Showtime exec often visited Kittanning to see his grandparents, Charles and Ruth Nevins, when he was growing up.</p>
