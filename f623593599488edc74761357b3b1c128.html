<h1>With elbow injury in rearview, Pirates' Nick Burdi doing his best to 'keep everything moving'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s been a long, up-and-down battle back to clean health for Nick Burdi.</p>
<p>In May 2017, the Pirates reliever had Tommy John surgery, then fought back to make his major league debut in September 2018. The next season saw Burdi begin with a clean bill of health, but in April, he suffered a devestating injury while pitching against the Diamondbacks, one that left the pitcher lying on the PNC Park mound. It was later diagnosed as neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, bringing Burdi another surgery and forcing him out for the season.</p>
<p>Despite all that, Burdi was back in 2020. In spring training, he was hitting triple digits again, proving his value and jockeying for a spot in the Pirates bullpen come opening day.</p>
<p>Now those plans are on hold, with the 2020 season delayed due to the COVID-19 crisis. While one could forgive him for feeling a bit anxious that the opportunity for a return to the big leagues has been pushed back an unknown amount of time, Burdi understands the bigger picture.</p>
<p>“During the spring, obviously the velocity was back up there. I was throwing well,” Burdi said. “But when the whole pandemic [and] suspension of the league ... happened, I think for me personally, it was more just trying to get myself and my wife back home somewhere safe to kind of just hunker down and get through this without putting ourselves at risk or other people at risk. That was the main concern at this point.”</p>
<p>Burdi, like many, has been paying attention to possible projections of when baseball might return, but whether or not those projections are correct doesn’t really affect how he goes about his day-to-day life at the moment.</p>
<p>Right now, as is surely the case with many professional athletes, that consists of trying to stay in shape. Burdi says he’s been riding his bike frequently, along with free weight and band workouts, all while trying his best to stay on schedule with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/02/10/Pirates-Oscar-Marin-pitching-Rapsodo-TrackMan-analytics-2020-technology/stories/202002100147" target="_blank">the Pirates’ throwing program</a>.</p>
<p>“Just stuff that we might be doing in season regardless,” Burdi said. “Just trying to keep everything moving the way it’s supposed to so when the phone does ring, I’m in shape and ready to go and get back out there to where I was in the spring.”</p>
<p>An interesting wrench to all of this is what could be at stake for Burdi this season. With the recent MLB-MLBPA agreement that guarantees service time to players whether or not games are played in 2020, Burdi will be arbitration eligible next offseason.</p>
<p>It would be hard to guess what that contract situation would look like for a guy like Burdi, who has shown tantalizing value with his ability but has only pitched 10 innings in the majors thanks to his injuries.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say, then, that a strong 2020 could go a long way for Burdi toward proving what he can do to the Pirates and making some more money as a result.</p>
<p>Again, that’s secondary to Burdi right now. In his mind, as it should be, baseball will be back eventually, but there is more at stake in the grander scheme of things.</p>
<p>When it does come back, though, Burdi hopes to return to where he was in the spring.</p>
<p>“There’s no baseball or sports or anything right now in general,” Burdi said. “But again, it’s just one of those things where now, this trumps any kind of sporting event or concert or anything like that. Just making sure that everyone’s safe and healthy.</p>
<p>“Definitely just look forward to getting back out there, and when my name is called, go out and keep getting the job done and ... trying to fight for a job in the bullpen.”</p>
