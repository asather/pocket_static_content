<h1>Could Sidney Crosby return Sunday in Arizona? 'We're not ruling out anything'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. – Sidney Crosby took another stride in his recovery Saturday when the Penguins skated at the Ice Den, a community rink outside Phoenix. He appeared to be all-systems go in a team practice, took part in line rushes and wore a look of satisfaction while lingering on the ice afterward.</p>
<p>The captain first had to dodge a bullet, though. More accurately, a stray puck.</p>
<p>During the practice, linemate Patric Hornqvist fired a shot off the crossbar that nearly cracked Crosby in the face. Thankfully, it just grazed his helmet.</p>
<p>“Hockey gods don’t want me in the lineup right now, I guess,” Crosby joked.</p>
<p>There is a chance those deities will be disappointed Sunday in Glendale, Ariz.</p>
<p>Crosby, dripping with sweat after skating for about an hour, would not rule out returning to the lineup Sunday against the Arizona Coyotes. He chatted with the media before huddling up with the medical staff, which surely will have some say in the matter. But Crosby is pleased with the progress he has made.</p>
<p>“I’m sure they'll see how I felt today. That will be the first question then we’ll go from there,” he said. “Just getting back out there and feeling good and feeling better every day is the most important thing. And that’s how it's gone.”</p>
<p>Mike Sullivan also passed on a chance to declare Crosby out for Sunday, saying, “We’re not ruling out anything. We’re just taking each day as it comes.”</p>
<p>The coach added: “When he practices, it’s amazing the influence he has on our team. The pace of the practice just elevates significantly. ... I know our guys are excited when he's out there with us. It improves our team morale. Our energy was great today. We really liked the pace. And Sid had a strong practice.”</p>
<p>Crosby, in his first full-squad practice since Jan. 3, was the first skater on the ice. He wore a regular jersey, signifying that he is cleared for contact, though he later danced around a question about that. He was between Jared McCann and Hornqvist during line rushes. He also worked with the top power play.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to get as much contact as I can. It’s pretty difficult with the practices,” the 32-year-old said. “It’s too bad I missed that one the other day. It’s just the way it goes. So, yeah, I’m trying to get a little bit of that in when I can.”</p>
<p>The team’s busy schedule, plus a minor illness, has presented a challenge.</p>
<p>He pushed himself Tuesday while skating with Nick Bjugstad and Justin Schultz, who are also on the trip rehabbing injuries. Wednesday’s practice in Las Vegas was extremely optional and most players, visions of roulette wheels spinning their heads, skipped it. Thursday was a scheduled day off for Crosby.</p>
<p>Crosby didn’t feel well Friday in Denver and didn’t skate for a second straight day. It sounds like everyone wished he would have practiced Thursday.</p>
<p>“Our schedule – we're playing so many games – it's not ideal for trying to get back into the lineup,” he said. “Getting practices in and the guys who are playing, I think their focus is to get out there, skate and get off and use the rest while you can. So I’m just trying to make the most of the practices with the group.”</p>
<p>Crosby, who has 17 points in 17 games, is still trying to get his timing back.</p>
<p>“When you’re playing games, the game seems to slow down a little bit,” he said. “But if you miss an extended period of time, it’s just your timing [that’s off] and plays tend to develop a little quicker. That just comes from playing games.”</p>
<p>Crosby has not played since Nov. 9. Five days later, he had sports hernia surgery in Philadelphia. The team announced he would miss at least six weeks. He has been skating for a few weeks now and joined team practices Jan. 1.</p>
<p>The Penguins rallied in his absence, going 17-6-4. That includes two wins in this week-long road trip. With Crosby looking in from the press box, Pittsburgh beat two of the Western Conference’s top teams in Vegas and Colorado.</p>
<p>Crosby was asked if the Penguins playing so well is allowing him to take his time coming back from a tricky injury without the risk a serious setback.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ll ever take my time,” he said. “But as far as the team playing well, it’s been pretty great to watch, just the different ways that we've won, different guys stepping up. … It’s been a team effort each and every night.”</p>
<p>He will soon be a part of that, whether it’s Sunday or the days that follow.</p>
<p>Well, unless those hockey gods have something else to say about it. But Crosby, after a close call Saturday in Arizona, can chuckle about the injury luck.</p>
<p>“It didn’t hit me in the face and I’m here to talk about it and laugh about it,” Crosby said. “Yeah, just another bit of adversity in the whole getting back.”</p>
