<h1>Bryan Reynolds shines in Pirates victory over Brewers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bryan Reynolds isn't exactly the type to let his emotions show. And even though his manager joked that the soft-spoken outfielder might not have a heartbeat, you know that Reynolds' slow start to the season was eating him up inside.</p>
<p>A year after hitting .314 and finishing fourth in NL Rookie of the Year voting, Reynolds waited until the Pirates’ fifth game of the season for his first hit. His first home run didn't come until last week. Entering Friday’s contest, Reynolds was hitting .174 and had just two hits in his previous 23 at-bats (.087).</p>
<p>Perhaps what Reynolds and the Pirates did to the Brewers in a 7-2 victory at PNC Park will help the young outfielder get back to looking like the excellent player he was last year, the one that Pittsburgh badly needs to be a building block for the future.</p>
<p>Reynolds had three hits against Milwaukee, including a home run and a triple, and drove in four runs, as the Pirates produced one of their most complete efforts of the season. He also made a terrific diving grab in left field.</p>
<p>"My timing felt right [Friday], but I've been getting outside of myself and maybe trying to do too much and make up too much ground," Reynolds said. "That’s tough. I just need to stay inside myself, get a good pitch to hit and not chase.”</p>
<p>Rediscovering his timing hasn't been easy for Reynolds. Pirates manager Derek Shelton thought he saw it coming on a foul ball last week in Cincinnati ... then the Pirates had to halt their season because the Reds had a positive COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>That's seemingly how it's gone for Reynolds, who snapped an 0-for-12 stretch with his home run against the Reds, which also served as his first RBI.</p>
<p>"He broke out [Friday] by taking really good swings at the right pitches," Shelton said. "He had aggressive at-bats.</p>
<p>“And how he's been with me or with the group is, the guy doesn't change. I mean, I'm pretty sure he doesn't have a heartbeat. He's the same guy every day, and that's why I think he's going to hit."</p>
<p>Reynolds wasn't the only enjoyable story to come out of Friday’s victory. Chad Kuhl started for the Pirates, gave them five innings of one-run ball and earned his first win since June 15, 2018.</p>
<p>While Kuhl had struck out 13 over nine innings in his previous two starts, he was much more of a contact pitcher Friday, striking out just one. He did lower his ERA to 1.73 in eight career games (seven starts) against the Brewers. Kuhl is 4-0, and the Pirates are 7-0 in those starts.</p>
<p>“It's really cool just to give my team a chance to win,” Kuhl said. “That's all I've ever wanted to do: be out there and give our team a chance to win. The long layoff, and then everything, it's just really cool."</p>
<p>What else to value from this one?</p>
<p>Start with five consecutive singles to start the fourth, scoring three. Before that, the Pirates had gone 47 consecutive innings without accumulating more than two hits in a single frame.</p>
<p>Gregory Polanco had a run-scoring single, while Cole Tucker reached on an infield single, one of three hits for him.</p>
<p>Another key sequence came in the sixth inning. Sam Howard started the frame and got two outs before allowing a single and a walk. In came Geoff Hartlieb, who issued another walk to load the bases.</p>
<p>But Hartlieb got right fielder Brock Holt to ground out to second base, then delivered a 1-2-3 seventh inning, striking out Brewers second baseman Keston Hiura swinging on an excellent slider to end it.</p>
<p>"I think we're seeing a kid that's starting to grow up on the mound," Shelton said of Hartlieb.</p>
<p>While snapping a four-game losing streak and winning for just the second time in their past nine games, the Pirates were helped by some excellent defense, including a smooth backhand stop from Erik Gonzalez at third base and a diving grab from Reynolds to rob Christian Yelich in left.</p>
<p>"I started my dive and thought, ‘Man, I hope I knock this down,' " Reynolds said. "Then it just kept coming, just long enough, and I was able to get my glove under it. So it’s better than rolling to the wall for an inside-the-park home run.”</p>
<p>But as special as that stuff might have been — Kuhl’s progress has been especially encouraging — Friday stood out because of Reynolds seemingly rediscovering his timing and hitting the ball more like he did in 2019.</p>
<p>Reynolds crushed a sinker from Brewers starter Adrian Houser for the homer and a changeup from Alex Claudio on his triple, while his swing looked plenty compact and powerful.</p>
<p>“[Friday] felt really good," Reynolds said. "I think we’re on the right track. I’m not going to say that anything’s cleared up yet, but it’s definitely moving in the right direction."</p>
