<h1>Ex-cop Rosfeld, acquitted in Antwon Rose II homicide, sues to get old Pitt policing job back</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former East Pittsburgh police officer <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/03/25/Jury-foreman-in-Rosfeld-trial-says-jurors-carefully-weighed-evidence-testimony-before-acquittal/stories/201903250060" target="_blank">who was acquitted of homicide</a> in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Antwon Rose II in 2018 has sued the University of Pittsburgh, its police chief and a top official, claiming he was improperly fired from the school’s police force earlier that year.</p>
<p>Michael Rosfeld of Penn Hills claims that Pitt violated his due process rights and the 14th Amendment by firing him in January 2018 without an internal hearing after he arrested Senior Vice Chancellor Kathy W. Humphrey’s son, Daniel Humphrey, outside a bar in December 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, filed Thursday in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court, Mr. Rosfeld specifically claims that Ms. Humphrey&nbsp;“intervened and acted in concert with” Pitt and university police Chief James Loftus&nbsp;“in retaliation for the actions of Plaintiff Rosfeld in effecting the arrest of her son Daniel Humphrey.”</p>
<p>Pitt had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>The suit&nbsp;claims that on Dec. 11, 2017, the morning after Mr. Rosfeld arrested Mr. Humphrey and two others who had been kicked out of the Garage Door Saloon on Atwood Street in Oakland,&nbsp;two police department supervisors came to his house to tell him he was under investigation. He claims they put him on administrative leave.</p>
<p>Six weeks later, on Jan. 18, 2018, according to the lawsuit, Chief Loftus terminated him by a memo that was handed to Mr. Rosfeld during a meeting at Pitt police headquarters.</p>
<p>The letter referenced an internal investigation number, which Mr. Rosfeld believes corresponds to the arrests outside the Garage Door Saloon.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosfeld claims that he was never told what charges led to his termination or given any explanation of the evidence against him. And he claims that he was not provided with a mandated pre-termination due process meeting called a Loudermill hearing. Such a meeting would have allowed him to contest his firing and present evidence.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosfeld is asking to be granted a Loudermill hearing, reinstated as a Pitt police officer retroactive to 2018 and be given lost wages and benefits.</p>
<p>It was as a Pitt officer that Mr. Rosfeld responded to the Garage Door Saloon on Dec. 9, 2017, to assist two colleagues who had Mr. Humphrey in custody along with Timothy Riley and Jacob Schilling. All three had been kicked out of the bar. Mr. Rosfeld checked the bar’s video, which showed that all three men engaged in unruly behavior, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>He charged all three and took them to jail. All the charges against the men were later withdrawn. Mr. Riley and Mr. Schilling sued Mr. Rosfeld and others, claiming false arrest, but the suit was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2018/12/06/michael-rosfeld-lawsuit-east-pittsburgh-police-antwon-rose-pitt-dismissed-civil-rights/stories/201812060153" target="_blank">voluntarily dismissed</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosfeld was acquitted by a jury in March of homicide in the June 19, 2018, shooting death of Antwon, 17, in East Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosfeld fatally shot Antwon in the back while the unarmed teen ran from a traffic stop just minutes after being with a friend who committed a drive-by shooting in North Braddock.</p>
