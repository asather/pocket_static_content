<h1>Young Steelers receivers looking for stability, guidance from new coach Ike Hilliard</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The newly configured Steelers receivers room does not have one player on a second NFL contract. The three established “veterans” — JuJu Smith-Schuster, Diontae Johnson and James Washington — are 24 or younger and rookie Chase Claypool just turned 22 last month.</p>
<p>That might be an issue for some assistant coaches throughout the league, but new Steelers receivers coach Ike Hilliard is used to coaching up young players and getting them in position to produce.</p>
<p>“Yes, on paper, it’s a considerably young group,” said Hilliard, who is entering his 10th season as an NFL assistant. “But I’ve been around young groups before. I’m no stranger to dealing with younger players and trying to help them with their journey.”</p>
<p>Hilliard did it last season when he was an assistant in Washington. His top three receivers in yards were rookies, led by Terry McLaurin, who led all rookies with 919 yards and seven touchdowns. Before he was receivers coach in Washington, McLaurin oversaw a young group of receivers in Buffalo in 2013 that included Robert Woods and Stevie Johnson. Woods, as a rookie in 2013, had 40 catches for 587 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
<p>Smith-Schuster is the Steelers’ most-accomplished receiver, even though he remains one of the youngest as he enters the final year of his rookie deal. In his first three NFL seasons, Smith-Schuster has nearly 3,000 receiving yards and 17 touchdowns despite posting his worst season last year as he battled through injuries.</p>
<p>Johnson led all rookies last season in catches with 59 and added 580 yards and five touchdowns. And Washington, after a disappointing rookie season, led the Steelers with 735 yards and scored three touchdowns.</p>
<p>Those are some impressive statistics for the Steelers’ top three receivers, but head coach Mike Tomlin was looking for someone with discipline and a track record of success in teaching after they went through a traumatic 2019 season off the field.</p>
<p>Darryl Drake died during training camp last summer, which devastated them. Ray Sherman, who was retired, took over as receivers coach for the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>It might seem like a small detail, but Hilliard is the fourth position coach for Smith-Schuster in as many years. He is the third position coach for Washington, who entered the league in 2018.</p>
<p>“It’s my job to help these young men to prepare, how they have to prepare and teach them how to be pros,” Hilliard said. “That’s no disrespect to anyone who has been here before me. That’s what I’ve been asked to do. And I intend to do that. I’m going to lead by example, lead them through the way I teach, how I prepare.”</p>
<p>Thus far, most of the time Hilliard has spent with his receivers has been through phone calls and virtual meetings via Zoom. Soon, they will convene on the practice field and Hilliard will get to convey his methods on the field for the first time.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic eliminated all spring workouts and training camp will be the only opportunity to get to know and evaluate his players.</p>
<p>Hilliard said he won’t let the COVID-19 limitations become an excuse for his group.</p>
<p>“Every year is the same for me,” said Hilliard, who spent 12 seasons as a receiver in the league with the Giants and Buccaneers. “I’m not going to make any excuses. We’re going to get these guys ready to play. These kids are extremely talented. It’s our job to get the most out of them. We’re not going to make excuses about how much time we missed this offseason. When we do get real snaps, we have to maximize those.’</p>
<p>That time is coming soon. The Steelers will begin some on-field work soon and padded practices will commence Aug. 17. A lot will be covered in the next six weeks before the Steelers open the season against the Giants.</p>
<p>Youth will be served. It’s inevitable given the makeup of the group.</p>
<p>But Hilliard is determined to get his players in position to produce.</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing a lot of talking. I think they’re ready to get on the grass now,” Hilliard said. “When I first got into coaching, I worked for Mike Shanahan. He told me as a coach it will take me three years to learn all the details of his offense. Imagine that as a young coach.</p>
<p>“And now you turn that over to a young player. We have quite a few of those in the room, and that’s OK. We’re just going to accelerate the process and hammer out the details. We are going to challenge these young men to be great. We are going to challenge them to detail everything in their work, in their prep, in their individual portion of practice, in team, during note-taking, during everything. We just have to continue to grow and get better.”</p>
