<h1>Diocese of Pittsburgh cancels Masses ‘until further notice’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh has <a href="https://www.diopitt.org/news/allmassescancelled" target="_blank">canceled all Masses</a> in the diocese effective Monday amid concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In a press release Sunday evening, the diocese said all Masses would be canceled&nbsp;“until further notice.”</p>
<p>“Although in many ways it saddens me to make this decision, given the best advice from health&nbsp;experts on federal, state and local levels, I feel it is a necessary one at this time,” Bishop David Zubick wrote in the release. “I’m counting&nbsp;on the understanding and cooperation of all in the Diocese of Pittsburgh as we pray for each&nbsp;other.”</p>
<p>Arrangements are being made to live stream future Masses, the release said. More information on how to proceed with sacraments like baptisms and confession would be announced Monday.</p>
<p>The cancellation comes during the Lenten season. The six-week period, which ends on Good Friday, is one of the most significant in the Catholic Church’s calendar.&nbsp;</p>
