<h1>Trump cut off Monday news conference after ‘ask China’ exchange</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After touting his administration’s efforts to expand COVID-19 testing, President Donald Trump on Monday cut his news briefing short and walked off the Rose Garden following a tense exchange with two reporters, including an Asian American journalist he deferred to China and another he refused to hear out because she let her colleague ask a follow-up.</p>
<p>CBS’s Weijia Jiang asked the president why it matters that the U.S. is “doing far better than any other country when it comes to testing?”</p>
<p>“Why is this a global competition if every day Americans are still losing their lives?” she asked.</p>

<p>Trump, who had praised China’s response to the deadly virus several times earlier this year but has since pinned the pandemic on the country repeatedly for weeks, responded that, “They’re losing their lives everywhere in the world.”</p>
<p>“Maybe that’s a question you should ask China,” he added. “Don’t ask me. Ask China that question, OK? When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer.”</p>
<p>The president tried moving on to the next reporter he had called on, CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, but Collins let Jiang finish a follow-up question.</p>
<p>“Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically?” asked Jiang, who describes herself as a “Chinese-born West Virginian” in her Twitter bio.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you, I’m not saying it specifically to anybody,” Trump responded. “I’m saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a nasty question,” Jiang said.</p>
<p>The president then tried to call on someone other than Collins, saying, “Next please." Collins said she “just wanted to let my colleague finish.”</p>
<p>Yamiche Alcindor, of PBS, tweeted that, “He called on me but I motioned for Kaitlin to ask her Q so Trump walked off.”</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much,” the president said before walking back to the White House.</p>
<p>The moment was yet another fiery public clash between Trump and journalists at a White House briefing on a pandemic that’s killed 80,000 Americans.</p>
<p>Before the exchange with Jiang and Collins, Trump had responded to multiple questions on testing by saying the media wouldn’t be happy no matter how his administration handled the issue.</p>
<p>Earlier in the news conference, Trump noted that he was displeased with China, which he claims did not warn the world about the outbreak’s spread early enough.</p>
<p>Trump, who’s faced criticism for downplaying the virus earlier in the year, touted his decision to ban travel from China in late January, saying the move saved thousands of lives.</p>
<p>He also announced that his administration had approved an additional $11 billion in funding to expand coronavirus testing throughout the country. The federal government will also send the states tens of millions of pieces of testing equipment and material.</p>
<p>“Governors and us are working very close, not only on testing but on ventilators, where at this point we have capacity that’s virtually unlimited,” Trump said. He added that the U.S. was sending “many, many thousands” of ventilators to other nations in need.</p>
<p>For her part, Jiang in March said that a White House official had called the coronavirus disease the “Kung-Flu."</p>
<p>“Makes me wonder what they’re calling it behind my back,” she tweeted.</p>
