<h1>New Kensington cop killer's mother convicted for hindering son's arrest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The mother of Rahmael Sal Holt — who was sentenced to death in November by a Westmoreland jury for the death of New Kensington police officer Brian Shaw —&nbsp; has been convicted on hindering charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Officer Shaw tried to pull over a Grand Cherokee Jeep driven by Tavon Harper the night of Nov. 17, 2017. Police said Holt, 31, a passenger, got out and ran along Leishman Avenue in New Kensington. Officer Shaw chased him, and Holt fatally shot the rookie, police said.</p>
<p>47-year-old Sherry Holt was convicted Thursday by a jury in Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Kevin G. Sasinoski’s courtroom. Police said Sherry and Holt’s cousin Marcel Mason, 29, initially denied having any contact with Holt as authorities searched for him in the days following the shooting.</p>
<p>Sherry was told in order to avoid being charged, she was to report any contact with Holt to police within 12 hours. Police said she did not contact them as instructed. She eventually told&nbsp;a Westmoreland County detective that she had seen her son Friday after the shooting, according to police reports.</p>
<p>Investigators said Mason provided Holt a change of clothes sometime following the shooting. Mason’s girlfriend Aysa Benson was also charged.</p>
<p>Sherry remains free on $100,000 bond, court records show. A sentencing date is set for April 23.</p>
