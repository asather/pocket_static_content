<h1>Penguins' losing streak alive and kicking (them) with 3-2 loss to Anaheim</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ANAHEIM, Calif. – The Penguins could only shake their heads after their latest loss.</p>
<p>Well, maybe after they were done slamming sticks and kicking their lockers.</p>
<p>One could argue they were the better team at 5-on-5. The problem was that only 24 minutes of the first two periods were played without somebody in the box. By then, the Penguins were down a pair of goals and trying to play catch-up.</p>
<p>Matt Murray did a good job of getting in front of pucks that didn’t deflect off of one of his defensemen. Unfortunately, two goals went in off Zach Trotman.</p>
<p>And while they got several good looks on Anaheim Ducks goalie John Gibson, the Penguins were turned away again. They have scored just eight goals during their losing streak, which stretched to five games with a 3-2 loss at Honda Center.</p>
<p>The outcome might have been different had Gibson not made an incredible save on Bryan Rust with the Penguins trailing, 2-1, near the end of the second period. But the Whitehall native extended his left leg pad to rob Rust on the doorstop. Moments later, the Ducks pinballed another in off Trotman to pull away.</p>
<p>It was the second straight loss for the Penguins against one of the worst teams in the West. The Ducks had just three wins in their previous 10 games and only the lowly Los Angeles Kings had fewer points among Western Conference teams.</p>
<p>The Penguins lost to those Kings, 2-1, two nights earlier in Los Angeles. They dominated in that game but hit two posts, squandered three power plays and couldn’t tie the score despite getting chances in the frantic final seconds.</p>
<p>The Ducks had just two shots in the first period Friday. But one of them went in off Trotman, back in the lineup after he was a healthy scratch Wednesday.</p>
<p>He made a kick save with Murray down and out midway through the first to keep the game scoreless. But later in the period, a shot by Danton Heinen hit Trotman in the pants and dropped behind Murray for the first goal of the game.</p>
<p>Late in the first period, Ducks center Ryan Getzlaf got whistled for hooking. The guys in stripes tacked on another two minutes after he barked at them on his way to the box. The Penguins took advantage. Early in the second period, 11 seconds into the second minor, Jason Zucker tipped a point shot past John Gibson.</p>
<p>The Ducks regained the lead with a power-play goal of their own. Getzlaf scored after Justin Schultz clobbered him with a high stick, earning a double minor.</p>
<p>The penalty kill has been a problem lately. The Penguins allowed four goals on nine opportunities in the previous four games to fall out of the NHL’s top 10. But they came away with a key kill later in the second after Evgeni Malkin got called for hooking then got another two minutes for tomahawking the glass.</p>
<p>Late in Malkin’s second minor, Gibson denied Rust on that glorious shorthanded chance. Not long after that, the Ducks made it 3-1 when another puck went in off of Trotman. This time, Brendan Guhle threw a shot on goal with three Penguins in front. Trotman tried to block it but it ricocheted off his knee past Murray.</p>
<p>Murray was in goal Friday after Tristan Jarry started Wednesday against the Kings. He entered the night with losses in four of his previous five starts, the latest being Sunday’s 5-3 loss in Washington. He stopped 18 of 22 shots in that game.</p>
<p>Goaltending, which has been one of the team’s greatest strengths since the start of December, hasn’t been nearly as good during this five-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s hard to win when you’re rarely scoring. After the loss to the Kings, Patric Hornqvist expressed confidence that more scoring was on the way.</p>
<p>Zucker scored again with 1:21 left in the game to pull the Penguins back within a goal. It was Zucker’s fifth in nine games since the Penguins traded for him.</p>
<p>But Gibson was too good on this night, stopping 28 shots to earn the victory.</p>
<p>With their fifth loss in a row, all of which came in regulation, and a Philadelphia Flyers win Friday, the Penguins dropped to third in the Metropolitan Division.</p>
<p>The Penguins will wrap up their four-game road trip Saturday in San Jose.</p>
