<h1>North Allegheny’s Nathan Hoke, son of former Steeler, commits to BYU football</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Light hair seems to run in the Hoke family. So does Brigham Young University football.</p>
<p>Nathan Hoke, a senior linebacker at North Allegheny High School, made a verbal commitment Monday to Brigham Young. The Cougars offered Hoke a scholarship only two Saturdays ago.</p>
<p>Hoke said it wasn’t a foregone conclusion that he would eventually choose BYU. But family ties can bind.</p>
<p>Chris Hoke, Nathan’s father, had a wonderful career as a football player at BYU before he played eight years for the Steelers and won two Super Bowls. Cade Hoke, Chris’ son and Nathan’s brother, also played at North Allegheny and signed with BYU in 2019 as a preferred walk-on. Cade is currently serving a two-year mission before hoping to play for the Cougars in 2021.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t for sure that I’d choose (Brigham Young),” Nathan Hoke said. “Once I saw some other scholarship offers coming in before, I was thinking maybe I might like some other schools if I could get out and visit them. But I was never able to get out and visit anywhere because of the coronavirus, and once Brigham Young offered, it was a no-brainer. The opportunity to possibly play with my brother was something that I couldn’t pass up, either.”</p>
<p>Hoke also had scholarship offers from FBS colleges Akron and Central Michigan. Hoke’s grandparents live in Utah, not far from the Brigham Young campus.</p>
<p>“I’ve grown up loving the school, loving the team,” Hoke said. “I’ve been to the campus, seen the football [field] and everything. It’s always been the team in my mind that I wanted to play for.”</p>
<p>Like his brother, Nathan also will go on a two-year mission before he starts college at Brigham Young. He said he will most likely go on the mission not long after he graduates from high school.</p>
<p>“I think it’s the best option for me,” Nathan Hoke said. “It’s a choice, but if you go right out of high school, you come back older and then you have your freshman year and four years of football left.”</p>
<p>Hoke is expected to be one of the top linebackers in the WPIAL this season. He has grown a little since last season, put on a few pounds and now is 6-foot-3, 225 pounds.</p>
<p>Hoke said he and his father have been worried recently about the high school football season being canceled in Pennsylvania because of COVID-19. Hoke considered possibly transferring to a high school in Utah, a state that plans to have high school football this fall.</p>
<p>“It’s not as likely any more,” Hoke said. “The season in Utah starts really early, but I just would want to play here more than anything. I want to play with all the guys I’ve been playing with and I feel like North Allegheny has a real chance at winning a WPIAL championship this year.”</p>
<p><strong>Walker to Akron</strong></p>
<p>Central Valley receiver Myles Walker committed to Akron. He is the second Central Valley to choose an FBS school. Defensive back Stephon Hall committed to Pitt in June.</p>
