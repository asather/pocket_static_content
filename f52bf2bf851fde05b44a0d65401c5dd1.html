<h1>Carnegie Mellon gives workers community service option to maintain full pay</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Thousands of Carnegie Mellon University employees who cannot fill their entire schedule with remote work can use some of their days for community service with full pay, the school’s president said Monday.</p>
<p>Farnam Jahanian, in a note to Carnegie Mellon’s 4,535 staff in Pittsburgh and nationally, encouraged them to use the option of taking up to 10 days for community service or using the time for professional development opportunities.</p>
<p>“The employee will be compensated as normal for this time,” he said.</p>
<p>The temporary policy and other related moves are intended to give employees greater flexibility to retain full pay at least through May 31. He said it does not apply to workers covered by union workers governed by collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p>“As this pandemic continues to upend our daily lives, I recognize many of you are dealing with your own unique challenges and my heart goes out to all those being affected on a personal level by this public health emergency,” he said.</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon also is creating what Mr. Jahanian called an “Alternative Work Marketplace for Remote Assignments.” Under it, supervisors find work able to be performed remotely across the university. Those tasks are then paired with university employees based on their skill sets and if they are positioned to do the work away from campus.</p>
<p>CMU is also providing new Paid Time Off options upping by five additional days the previously announced 10 days of extra emergency days as earned by employee.</p>
