<p>The Steelers’ 1974 rookie class might be the best in NFL history. With <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/15/donnie-shell-hall-of-fame-centennial-class-2020-steelers/stories/202001150114" target="_blank">safety Donnie Shell’s election</a> Wednesday, it’s now produced five Pro Football Hall of Famers. Center Mike Webster, linebacker Jack Lambert and receivers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth were the others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most observers — and even coach Chuck Noll himself — didn’t see that coming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time, even the headliners — Swann at No. 21 overall in the first round and Lambert at No. 46 overall in the second — received lukewarm reviews for what they weren’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither filled an obvious need. Post-Gazette sports writer Jack Sell explained in the paper’s Jan. 30, 1974 edition that Noll&nbsp;“seemed to be drafting to his strengths rather than his weaknesses, pegged by most rooters as offensive tackle, tight end and running backs.”</p>
<p>And in his lead on Jan. 29, the Press’s Phil Musick called Swann’s selection over the available tight ends a&nbsp;“surprise.”</p>
<p>Their measurables left Sell wanting as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Both new members of Rooney U (that was a nickname for the Steelers at the time) are on the small side as pro football players go,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Steelers were more confident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noll praised Swann, in particular, for a standout performance in the Senior Bowl that included a game-winning catch in the waning moments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I just couldn’t keep my eyes off Swann in the practices the week before the Senior Bowl,” Noll told Sell.&nbsp;“I had heard about him of course, but the close-up was even better.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>For that reason, there was some passing doubt about whether Swann would even sign with the Steelers. He’d also been drafted by the World Football League’s Memphis franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noll wasn’t worried, though, as he told Sell that he expected Swann’s competitiveness would cause him to opt for the NFL’s higher level of competition. He was right about that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was wrong, however, about the depth of the draft. Like, really wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As Chuck Noll had it figured,” Musick wrote on Jan. 30,&nbsp;“the draft would be worthwhile for only&nbsp;‘about a round and a half.’ The Steelers selected 21st, meaning a single mistake was likely to be fatal.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the Steelers scooped up Stallworth in the fourth round and Webster in the fifth to close out the first day. Shell, meanwhile, went undrafted and instead signed with the team soon after as a free agent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest, of course, is history. Swann and Stallworth retired as the two best receivers in Steelers history. Lambert and Webster became symbolic of the franchise’s 1970s dominance because of their toughness. And Shell? Well he merely earned five Pro Bowl nods and three first-team All-Pro selections while patrolling the secondary behind the legendary&nbsp;“Steel Cutain” front.</p>
<p>The five men ended up winning four Super Bowls together. Quite the achievement for a group that started out with its coach getting pressed to explain its lack of an impact tight end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We don’t draft people because we hate the people we have,” Noll responded.&nbsp;“We’re trying to upgrade our football team.”</p>
<p>Musick greeted that with some skepticism.</p>
<p>“Whether the Steelers have, of course, remains to be seen,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Boy, was it ever.</p>
