<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As it prepares to celebrate its 125th anniversary later this year, the Carnegie Museum of Art on Thursday welcomed four new directors: Clarissa Morales (Collections &amp; Exhibitions Management), Chris Fry (Finance), Stefanie Mohr (Marketing &amp; Engagement) and Jason Segreti (Visitor Services).</p>
<p>The quartet joins the CMOA team at what the museum calls "a pivotal time," including preparations to produce the next Carnegie International, in 2022.</p>
<p>Morales will arrive from the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University, where she served as director of Collections, Conservation, &amp; Exhibitions. In her previous position as Exhibition Project Manager at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, she was instrumental in managing the reinstallation of the museum's new facility in 2016, according to the CMOA release.</p>
<p>Director of Finance Fry's previous experience includes treasurer of the board of directors for Pittsburgh Center for Arts and Media. For CMOA, he will be responsible "for fiscal management of the museum and serves as a critical link between the museum and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh financial team."</p>
<p>Mohr most recently served as assistant vice president and head of corporate communications for the Consumer Products Division at L'Or√©al in New York City, while Segreti has worked within the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh organization for more than 15 years. He is a Pittsburgh native and graduate of the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
