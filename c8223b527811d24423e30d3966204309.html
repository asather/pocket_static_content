<h1>Long-awaited federal approval granted for Alcosan wet weather plan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority has received federal court approval to move ahead with its plan to remove 7 billion gallons of stormwater and sewage from rivers and streams in Allegheny County.</p>
<p>The modified consent decree alters, updates and expands a 2008 federal consent order. The order required Alcosan to eliminate illegal sanitary sewer discharges into the region’s rivers and streams and reduce sewage and storm water overflows from 153 combined sewer outfalls by 85%.</p>
<p>“This is the end of a very long, educational and exciting road,” said Alcosan Executive Director Arletta Scott Williams. “I’m pleased that the court and the plaintiffs agreed with our approach for improving the water&nbsp;quality of our rivers and streams, and we are all excited to continue forward with that important goal.”</p>
<p>The agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and the Allegheny County Health&nbsp;Department was approved by the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania Thursday and announced by Alcosan Friday.</p>
<p>The new agreement extends the authority’s original deadline for fixing those overflows by a decade, to 2036, and proposes building more than 15 miles of underground 14-foot-diameter storage tunnels along the city’s rivers to capture the overflows during storms.</p>
<p>During dry weather the stored stormwater and sewage would be released to flow to the Woods Run treatment facility, which is undergoing a $300 million expansion that will eventually double its treatment capacity.</p>
<p>The new plan also contains “adaptive management” language that will allow Alcosan the flexibility to use new technology as it becomes available, and also add environmentally friendly “green infrastructure” components.</p>
