<h1>Mike White's high school sports chat transcript: 03.03.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Mike White</strong>: Sorry for little delay in getting started. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>Wilford</strong>: Mike, why no mention of Carmody’s outburst at the end of the championship game? Going after an official? Why are you glossing over this and not even mention the disciplinary letter with the WPIAL? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Just posted story on website. Never knew about letter from WPIAL until today. Can’t write about something don’t know about. It’s not as if WPIAL sent out a release about the letter. Anyway, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/03/03/mars-michael-carmody-discipline-wpial-championship-laurel-highlands/stories/202003030102" target="_blank">story is now posted</a>. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Hearing with Michael Carmody and Mars is Wednesday. WPIAL or Mars won’t reveal penalty that is in letter because it’s a matter of student discipline. But Mars requested hearing. So he is facing some kind of suspension of some kind. PIAA playoffs start Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Brah</strong>: It was a shame to see Allderdice girls’ season come to an end without much attention. They won the city league by an average of close to 50 points per contest, which has to be some sort of record. A little more coverage of that team would have been nice. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: They had a nice season. We did a story on Emma Waite this season and her having 1,000 points. We covered City League championship game with a story. Apparently that’s not enough. There are about 130 boys and girls teams playing basketball in WPIAL and then the City League. NOBODY ever gets enough coverage if you listen to people. Allderdice girls were nice team but if they did something in the state playoffs they’d probably get more coverage. Look at the coverage the Allderdice boys have gotten in recent years. Because they did things outside the City.</p>
<p><strong>BlueEagle</strong>: Hopefully the refs are much better this time around. They were particularly awful in the STO/OLSH game. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, everyone knows it’s always bad officiating.</p>
<p><strong>CML</strong>: Devin Carney is a better prospect than Ethan Morton. Prove me wrong.. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Woooo hoooo. Take that comedy act on tour.</p>
<p><strong>B-town</strong>: What offers does that Carney kid have? why is he being slept on? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don’t know of any D-1 offers he has, unless I’m wrong. Yes, he is very good but he is only a sophomore and I don’t know what he’s done in AAU. He is a tremendous shooter and scorer but I don’t know yet what level he will be recruited at. A lot will depend on whether he grows. Not demeaning the kid’s talent. But you asked about recruiting and the way recruiting goes is that 6-foot shooters aren’t exactly a hot commodity at the major-college level.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Mike, I was really struck by the number of fresh-soph-juniors starting for most of the girls finalists this past weekend. Whoa, gonna have some powerhouse teams in next couple years in WPIAL girls. Don’t follow girls closely, but seems much more common to happen than in boys? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I did a big story earlier this season about how freshmen have much more impact in all sports these days. It’s been a trend I’d say that started maybe 15-20 years ago but is even more popular now. A few reasons. Kids are trained more at a younger age and are more ready to play as freshman than years ago. Plus, in some sports, not as many kids are playing. So that opens spots for younger kids. Take girls basketball for instance in WPIAL. Many fewer girls are playing. It’s been documented. Teams can’t even field JV teams sometimes. So with fewer players, young players get more of a chance to play.</p>
<p><strong>WPIAL fan</strong>: Do you know anything about the District 3 teams that are matched up with some of the WPIAL 6A boys teams? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Not really. Other than their records.</p>
<p><strong>ahmed</strong>: Lincoln park is losing a lot of players. Can they be as dominate in 4a without getting new players in? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Supposedly Lincoln Park has talent on bench also. That’s what I’ve heard. It’s not totally definite they’ll be moving to 4A. But likely. It’s the new PIAA competition formula that counts how far you go in playoffs and do you have a transfer in two years. Too complicated to explain in a chat. But bottom line is this: If Lincoln Park makes PIAA quarterfinals, they will have enough points in the competition formula that they will will be bumped up to 4A next year.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: If crowd size stays the same I see no other option than the Pete for WPIAL. I just wish they could move student sections down toward the court. The games at RMU with the student sections close to the court really added to the atmosphere. I wish both RMU and PITT would make the center scoreboards provide game info such as score, fouls and player stats. Kind of a pain looking around the gym for that information. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Hey Guest, are you a mind reader or what. Because all of what you said has been in my head. Amen to you on the student sections being allowed in the first level of the end zones at The Pete. With The Pete now being reconfigured, the end zone seats are about the same on both sides. So I agree, put the student sections there. I know WPIAL will say they put them on second level because of security, but c’mon, man. That can be managed. And you’re right on about the score. I’ve been saying for years why can’t the score be put on the big board in the center? Makes no sense to me. Maybe it takes more money to have that, I’m not sure. But great thoughts by you and totally agree with them. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: And Guest, about playing at The Pete. People say they should play at new RMU place or Palumbo. They could do that, but only for smaller classes. Places just aren’t big enough. Saturday night doubleheaders past few years have had over 5,000. This year over 6,000. Remember, UPMC and new Palumbo will hold only 4,000 or so. That’s not big enough. People shouldn’t be turned away to see a championship game. For smaller class games, The Pete seems kind of empty. Putting students on first level would help with that. Would two sites be out of the question????</p>
<p><strong>LHzerogravity</strong>: Do you think Rodney Gallagher is a shoe-in for the FAB-5 after leading his team to the 5A Championship as a freshman? Has a freshman ever been on the list before? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No he’s not a shoe-in. Nothing has been decided yet. And no freshman has ever made Fab 5 in 40 years. He is very talented, especially for a freshman. The thing you have to do when picking all-star teams like Fab 5 is remove the fact that he’s only a freshman. People say how good he is for a freshman. And he is. But I think what you have to do is think of him as a junior and then say, “Is he one of the five best players?” “Is he a better player just right now - not for the future - than a junior or senior?” We haven’t decided yet. A number of people will weigh in on the decision.</p>
<p><strong>pants</strong>: I thought Carney had offer from St Francis PA....and that’s it.... <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: He might. I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>Nation66</strong>: Mr. White, I’m a little confused. Do you happen to know why the PIAA would schedule a game between Laurel Highlands and York Suburban this Friday night, when Laurel Highlands (Uniontown) is only about 35 miles from Greensburg, and the folks from York, Pa. have to drive 200 miles. Am I missing something? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Sites can be hard to figure, I know. But this is not unusual. In these first few rounds, some teams travel to the home district of the other team. It’s just the way the PIAA does it. Laurel Highlands is a district champ. York is the No. 9 team from District 3. I don’t think a No. 9 team should be complaining about having to travel. Other teams do also.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Mike, can you explain why the PIAA uses a set standard for matchups based upon districts for the state playoffs and not more of a seeding based on overall record? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: They have never seeded state playoffs. I agree it might be good to do, but it can’t be on overall records. Some teams play really good non section schedules. Seeding on records wouldn’t be fair. To seed the state playoffs, it would take some people who have some knowledge about whole state in all classifications and have seen teams. There aren’t a lot of those people around. It’s kind of seeded based on where you finish in your district. For example, Laurel Highlands is a WPIAL champ. They are playing a No. 9 team from District 3.</p>
<p><strong>Wpial Fan</strong>: I believe that Ethan Morton is extremely overrated and gets bailed out by the refs. He’s not even the best player on his team, Devin Carney carries the Butler Team throughout the playoffs. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You’re so insightful. I agree with you. I can’t even figure out why Morton is in the starting lineup. Makes no sense.</p>
<p><strong>WPIAL1</strong>: Hey Mike, thoughts on Vincentian closing? Catholic schools have had money issues for year, is this something that more with deal with, or is this just a Vincentian problem? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Catholic schools at many places have financial issues. It’s not just a Vincentian problem. Look at how many Catholic grade schools have closed.</p>
<p><strong>yoyo</strong>: Do you think that attendance is down for the lower classifications due to them mostly being private schools. They really dont have a fanbase <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don’t know if attendance in smaller classes is really any different than it was 15-20 years ago. True, smaller Catholic schools don’t bring as many fans but it’s always been that way. Nothing new. Where it’s really evident is with Philly Catholic schools in PIAA championships. Philly Catholic League championship had more than 9,000 at the Palestra. But those fans don’t care at all about states. They won’t bring 1,000 to state championships.</p>
<p><strong>hoop junkie</strong>: hey mike, just want to give a shout out to st gabe’s cyo hoop team for winning the state title !!! won their last 6 in a row to win the pittsburgh diocese and state title by beating st joan of arc from harrisburg !!! <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Woooo hooooo. CYO is tremendous. Do the St.Gabe’s players shop at all at Gabe’s??</p>
<p><strong>Myrtle Beach</strong>: Mike, can someone please explain why the WPIAL doesn’t give 1st round or 2 games a home game much like football does? Makes zero sense. You’d get bigger crowds, more money, and reward teams for regular season. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: It’s been talked about, but they haven’t done it. I don’t know about you but when the WPIAL hoops playoffs get to the quarterfinals, crowds are pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>bboy</strong>: where is morton ranked on the all time scoring list? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I think he is around 23rd or so right now.</p>
<p><strong>hoop junkie</strong>: not to mention losing by 10 in semifinals and losing by 14 in final .. coming back to win both in overtime <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: What heart.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Not asking this as a critic of private schools just curious, I see same cast of characters from out East on top of state rankings again, do you know if they get a steady flow of good transfers coming in every year to replenish rosters? I mean, Neumann, Math Civics, Imhotep, seems they never have an off year. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, they sometimes get transfers. One of Neumann-Goretti’s best players this year came from Maryland. But supposedly his family moved to Philly. But let’s get one thing straight. Philadelphia has a lot of talent. Much, much, much more than Pittsburgh. Those Philly kids will go to school somewhere. Yes, there is a ton of transferring but the Philly schools are on top a lot because there is a lot of talent there.</p>
<p><strong>BIGFAN</strong>: Mike, since Laurel girls lost to Bishop Canevin do you think the AD will start crying about the public / private playoffs again? Or will he remember the 57-0 blow out against Canevins football team last fall? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don’t know. I haven’t asked.</p>
<p><strong>lil prexie</strong>: Mike, 5A Girls bracket has a 1 win team from district 2. Kind of crazy to me <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: That has to do with only a few teams in a class from a district and they have to take a representative. Sometimes a team won’t even want to participate in state playoffs, so they have to take the next team.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: The PIAA Genie gave you 2 wishes for PIAA Basketball. What would you wish for, other than press get a cut of the gate. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: To have BIlly Owens go in a time machine and come back and play again. He was marvelous. ... And have a rematch right now with those teams from Sto-Rox and Trinity -- when guys are 30 something. And make sure Rocky Geiger plays.</p>
<p><strong>OZ</strong>: Any thought on which WPIAL winners will win State? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Hmmm. That’s hard to say. Best chance for boys team I would probably have to say Vincentian. Wouldn’t feel overly confident about any other team in any other class. As for girls, I think you’d have to say Char Valley. Won it last year, undefeated again this year. A 6A girls team might have a decent shot also.</p>
<p><strong>WPIAL fan</strong>: What games are you covering this weekend? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Upper St. Clair vs. Allderdice. Might go to Penn Hills and Obama also. Only games involving two WPIAL or City League teams.</p>
<p><strong>lil prexie</strong>: Any word on lack of availability for Heinz Field for fall football championships with Pitt playing the Saturday after Thanksgiving (week 4 of WPIAL Playoffs) <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Nothing yet. WPIAL hasn’t announced playoff format yet or dates. But the Pitt football game on Nov 28 probably won’t have any effect. WPIAL most likely would have 4 championships three weeks after regular season. That would be Nov. 21. Pitt is away that weekend. Past few years WPIAL has played only two title games four weeks after regular season -- and those two games have not been at Heinz. So it probably wouldn’t be an issue</p>
<p><strong>WPIAL fan</strong>: Who do you like in USC vs. Allderdice? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: USC <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: OK gotta go. We’ll do it again at 11 next Tuesday.</p>
