<p>In its latest release of data on Thursday, Pennsylvania reported 1,245 new cases of COVID-19 and said its deaths have eclipsed the 700 mark.</p>
<p>With the new figures, the state’s case total increased to 27,735 cases (from 26,490). With 60 new deaths, that total is at 707 (up from 647).</p>
<p>In Allegheny County, there&nbsp;are 21 new COVID-19 cases and 12 new deaths.</p>
<p>The new figures bring the county’s totals to 925 cases and 38 deaths, up from Wednesday’s totals of 904 cases and 26 deaths.</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s totals are the highest in Western Pennsylvania. The county said the increase in deaths is not reflective of the last 24 hours, but&nbsp;“reflects a delay in deaths being added to the surveillance system.”</p>
<p>Westmoreland County reported a new death on Thursday, increasing its total to 19, according to its coroner.</p>
<p>Indiana County reported its second death, a day after reporting its first. Beaver County’s coroner reported a total of 24 deaths as of Wednesday night, which is 10 more than what the state reported Thursday. Elsewhere in Western Pennsylvania, the following counties have reported deaths: Butler (5), Cambria (1), Fayette (3), Lawrence (5) and Washington (1).</p>
<p>Since the first case in Allegheny County was confirmed on March 11, there have been 162 hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Of those, 57 were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and 32 required a mechanical ventilator. The county said it has administered 10,872 tests.</p>
<p>At a press conference on Wednesday,&nbsp;Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, flanked by county Health Department Director Dr. Debra Bogen and the county’s chief epidemiologist Dr. LuAnn Brink, said the county is on the right track.</p>
<p>“We’re not declaring victory, not by a long shot, but we’re making progress,” Mr. Fitzgerald said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Brink said that one encouraging data point is the consistency of the rate of positive tests, which has hovered around 10% since the start of the pandemic, indicating a lack of “rapid spread.”</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen and Mr. Fitzgerald emphasized a desire to see more testing done, with Dr. Bogen hailing the opening of two new testing sites, one in Braddock and one on the North Side.</p>
<p>“Testing, testing, testing,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “We really need testing in order to make responsible health policy.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen all this success, but that success is because we’ve had physical distancing and all the things that Dr. Bogen and her team have recommended,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “If we start to unwind that too quickly, and don’t do that in a proper way, then that success is going to go the other way.”</p>
