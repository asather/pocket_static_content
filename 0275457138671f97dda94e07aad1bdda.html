<p>Actor Billy Porter, providing the “LGBTQ State of the Union” address ahead of President Donald Trump’s speech to Congress on Tuesday night, took the commander-in-chief to task for his administration’s treatment of the transgender community but said “our union is far from broken.”</p>
<p>Mr. Porter called the rate of violent crimes against transgender people “nothing short of an epidemic" in the speech, delivered from a clear lectern in a video published at noon by Logo TV. The award-winning performer \u2015 who also spoke on the state of the LGBTQ union a year ago \u2015 listed a range of other groups he said are under assault from the White House, including women and immigrants.</p>
<p>“The fate of the entire country is in the balance,” Mr. Porter said. “I know it sounds dramatic. But if now is not the time for drama, child, when is?”</p>
<p>While Mr. Porter’s roughly seven-minute commentary lacked the endless applause and myriad tributes of the marathon State of the Union in Washington, the 50-year-old Pittsburgh native still hit numerous serious notes.</p>
<p>“Donald J. Trump has painted himself as a friend of the LGBTQ community while revealing his true colors at every malicious turn,” Mr. Porter said. “For some of us, each day under this administration has been a matter of life and death.”</p>
