<h1>Biden tells N.H. voters he can re-establish ‘a culture consistent of who we are’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>HAMPTON, N.H. —&nbsp;Acknowledging that he no longer finds it easy to look voters in the eye and guarantee them that everything will be OK, former Vice President Joe Biden said Sunday that President Donald Trump “ripped the Band-Aid off” American values and economic security.</p>
<p>“Four years of this man will, God willing, go down as a historical aberration,” Mr. Biden told a crowd at the Ashworth by the Sea hotel on the Atlantic oceanfront, “but eight years will really change the nature of who we are for a long time to come.”</p>
<p>Between personal stories of New Hampshire voters he has met on the campaign trail, Mr. Biden established the high stakes of the November election and deemed himself the best Democratic Party candidate to beat Mr. Trump and re-establish “a culture consistent of who we are.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden acknowledged that this will require working with Republicans in the Senate who have been intimidated to act against the current president.</p>
<p>Those Republicans “know better,” he said, and instead of maligning his opposition, he would work to bring back good-faith arguments into the legislative process.</p>
<p>“I understand them better than anybody,” Mr. Biden said of the GOP. “I've been the object of their affection for a long time — for three years.”</p>
<p>Two days out from the first-in-the-nation primary, Mr. Biden spent a good chunk of his speech recalling times as a U.S. senator from Delaware and then as vice president when he built consensus to address issues that festered under the radar of lawmakers. He referred to writing the Violence Against Women Act in 1990 and helping lead the “It’s On Us” campaign during the Obama administration that raised awareness about sexual assault on college campuses.</p>
<p>His experience, he said, will allow him to address a “world in disarray” on day one of his presidency without a learning curve&nbsp;— an argument echoed by the former vice president’s canvassers in nearby Portsmouth, joined by Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey, stopping by the canvass office in a weekend swing through New Hampshire, told volunteers about his home state — and how Democrats won’t be able to take back the White House without it.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Mr. Casey, who endorsed Mr. Biden the day he announced his presidential bid, said Mr. Biden has demonstrated that he can put together a broad and diverse coalition and connect with voters in rural and small-town Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“Democrats in our state can’t simply rely upon an urban-suburban strategy,” Mr. Casey said. “That often is enough, but 2016 showed us that that is not enough.”</p>
<p>For Democrats to win, it’ll require maximizing the margins in rural counties instead of writing them off, Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>He said Mr. Biden’s health care plan will resonate with voters in rural Pennsylvania, where — if Mr. Trump is re-elected — cuts to Medicaid would close rural hospitals.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden would not only preserve protections for people with pre-existing conditions, Mr. Casey said, but institute a public option to cover those who don’t currently have insurance.</p>
<p>“It’s great to have interesting proposals, but it’s nice when you have someone who has great proposals for the future but who also has the experience and [has] gotten it done before,” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>Biden canvassers in Portsmouth described their candidate as someone who can restore respect and dignity to the U.S. globally and domestically.</p>
<p>But some said they were surprised when Mr. Biden cast doubt on his chances at winning New Hampshire during the Democratic debate this past week, saying he will likely “take a hit here” like he did in Iowa.</p>
<p>“For me, I was like, ‘Did I really hear that?’” said Lisa Louttit, a staging location director.</p>
<p>Ms. Louttit and two other volunteers said they’re confident in Mr. Biden’s chances, especially because a big chunk of the electorate remains undecided and will have to choose in the voting booth. When it comes to that, voters will ask themselves who truly has the best chance to beat Mr. Trump and will choose Mr. Biden, they said.</p>
<p>Asked if there are any candidates in the Democratic field they wouldn’t vote for come November, Ms. Louttit said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and explained that she was frustrated over his supporters’ attitudes about Hillary Clinton in 2016 after their candidate lost the nomination.</p>
<p>“They never voted,” Ms. Louttit said of Mr. Sanders’ supporters. “They stayed home.”</p>
<p>Mary Carey Foley, a longtime friend of Mr. Biden whose mother was mayor of Portsmouth, said she has written in Mr. Biden’s name in every presidential election since she met him more than 35 years ago.</p>
<p>She would consider doing it again if Mr. Biden doesn’t win the nomination, she said.</p>
