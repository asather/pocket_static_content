<h1>City Council holds facial recognition bill one week for further review</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council on Wednesday agreed to delay voting on a proposal that would regulate the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement.</p>
<p>Several members said they need more time to review the legislation that, if passed, would prevent the Department of Public Safety from purchasing and deploying facial recognition or predictive policing tools without council’s approval.</p>
<p>The bill, sponsored by Councilman Corey O’Connor, will be held one week despite the approval of amendments written in conjunction with the departments of Law and Public Safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respectively the departments suggested amendments regarding privacy and extenuating circumstances, he said.</p>
<p>“There was some technical words they would like to be added as far as an extenuating circumstance. Unfortunately I don’t like to discuss this, but if for example a mass shooting were to occur and the individual was still on the loose, that [police] could tap into some federal or state technologies that could help catch that criminal, Or if there was a bombing or extenuating circumstances like that,” Mr. O’Connor said.</p>
<p>Lengthy discussion on the bill followed nearly 20 minutes of public comment on the matter, with most speakers in support of regulating the use of facial recognition tools.</p>
<p>“I am thankful that all of the speakers were supporting brown and Black communities and have our best interest at heart, but as the representative of some of those same communities, I’m going to need some time to examine this bill,” Councilman Ricky Burgess said.&nbsp;“ ...&nbsp;One of the things that we have not talked as much about, which is a significant problem in our communities, is the homicide rate. And that unfortunately because of a variety of factors in those communities, there is a reticence and hesitancy to tell or to work with the police.”</p>
<p>Of the 37 homicides in Pittsburgh in 2019, 31 of the victims were Black; 13 occurred in Mr. Burgess’ District 9 neighborhoods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the 58 homicides in 2018, 19 occurred in Mr. Burgess’s district; 11 people were killed that year in neighboring Squirrel Hill after a gunman shot worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue building in the worst anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.</p>
<p>But Mr. O’Connor and several members pointed to findings that facial recognition technology can lead to continued racial bias in law enforcement as well as endanger civil liberties.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software" target="_blank">2019 National Institute of Standards and Technology study</a> that tested 189 software algorithms from 99 software developers found that false positives — or the matching of photos of two different people — happened at higher rates among African American faces than white faces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June the city suspended the use of an algorithmic tool used to predict where crime&nbsp;“hot spots” would occur, citing concerns of potential racial bias.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police currently do not own facial recognition technology, but a database from the Pennsylvania Justice Network — otherwise known as JNET — is accessible to police forces across the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Police spokeswoman Cara Cruz <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/08/25/Pittsburgh-police-facial-recognition-technology-Councilman-Corey-OConnor-bill/stories/202008250117" target="_blank">said on Aug. 25 after the bill’s introduction</a> that JNET’s “primary use is as [an] investigative tool only. Photographs or screen grabs from surveillance video from a crime, for example, would be analyzed and compared digitally through this technology.”</p>
<p>The results of a search are considered investigative leads and are not to be considered a positive identification of any subject, Ms. Cruz added.</p>
<p>The Department of Public Safety could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Lee Schmidt, the department’s assistant director, told council during the meeting that public safety is in support of holding the bill for further review of an opinion from the Law Department.</p>
<p>Seven council members approved a motion to hold one week. Mr. O’Connor voted against holding. Councilman Anthony Coghill was absent.</p>
