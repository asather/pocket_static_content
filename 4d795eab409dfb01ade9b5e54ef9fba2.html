<h1>Art Rooney II staying 'optimistic' about Heinz Field hosting fans this season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers president Art Rooney II said he is optimistic fans will be allowed to attend games at Heinz Field sometime after September, but that will only be determined by the governor and state and local health officials.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Wednesday, Rooney said the Steelers have had discussions with stadium officials from other teams about how best to space fans if and when they are allowed at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>“We’re going to stay optimistic about this,” Rooney said. “I really can’t predict when we can have fans come in and, when we do, it will be a percentage of capacity. We’re just going to remain optimistic by October we’re in a place where we can start to welcome them back.”</p>
<p>The Steelers announced last week that fans will not be allowed to attend their first two home games — Sept. 20 against the Denver Broncos and Sept. 27 against the Houston Texans. No decision has been made on the next home game after that — Oct. 11 against the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>That will come only after getting approval from Gov. Tom Wolf and other health officials, Rooney said.</p>
<p>Five NFL teams have already announced they will have fans in some reduced capacity for their opening game — Dallas, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Kansas City and Miami.&nbsp;Rooney said the NFL is not concerned about teams who are allowing a limited number of fans to attend games having a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>“I think we talked about this going back really earlier this year and, league-wide, there was a feeling that, look, we’re going to want fans wherever we can have fans,” Rooney said. “There was never, to my knowledge, anything like ‘We’re not going to have fans unless we all can have them.’ It’s going to be different, it’s going to be state by state, case by case. We all understand that.”</p>
<p>Rooney said he would not comment on any possible contract negotiations with defensive end Cam Heyward, who is the team’s top priority for a new deal. But, without mentioning Heyward, he did say “we’ve left the door open to see if we can get anything done” before the start of the season Sept. 14.</p>
<p>“We’ll see what happens,” he said.</p>
<p>Rooney cited the concern over the salary cap in 2021, which is already slated to drop from $198.2 million this season to a minimum of $175 million next season.</p>
<p>“I can’t speak to any particular player, but obviously we’re aware of the situation that we’re going to be facing next season. It’s going to be a challenge. We’re going to do the best we can in terms of, No. 1, making sure we do what we can this year. But it’s going to be a challenge, we all know that.”</p>
<p>Rooney said he never doubted the NFL, which will begin the regular season Sept. 10, would start on time.</p>
<p>“I never was at a point that we wouldn’t get the season started,” Rooney said. “I think we’re pretty confident we’re going to play next week and we’re excited about getting started. There have been a lot of ups and downs. I’m glad we’re where we are. Our players, coaches and staff have done a good job observing all the protocols. It hasn’t been easy, but we’re healthy.”</p>
<p>Asked if his expectations for the team were heightened by their offseason acquisitions, particularly tight end Eric Ebron and rookie receiver Chase Claypool, Rooney said, “I don’t make predictions. Our goals are always the same — we want to win a championship, and that starts with winning the division. I like our roster, and I like the makeup of the team.”</p>
<p><strong>Hillgrove suspended</strong></p>
<p>Longtime play-by-play announcer Bill Hillgrove will be suspended from broadcasting the first two games of both the Steelers’ and Pitt football seasons.</p>

<p>Hillgrove initially was to serve the Steelers suspension in the preseason, but there were no preseason games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He will broadcast the other remaining 14 games.</p>
<p>Pitt football opens its season Sept. 12 against Austin Peay and plays host to Syracuse on Sept. 19.</p>
