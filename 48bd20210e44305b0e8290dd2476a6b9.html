<h1>Pirates trade Jarrod Dyson to White Sox, creating opportunity in outfield</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Off the field, Jarrod Dyson’s time in Pittsburgh was largely successful. By all accounts, he was a good veteran leader and endeared himself well to teammates. The on-field portion did not go as well, the 36-year-old center fielder slashing just .157/.218/.375 and striking out 10 times in 51 at-bats.</p>
<p>Dyson’s time in a Pirates uniform came to a close on Friday, as general manager Ben Cherington traded him to the White Sox for international bonus money of $243,300 in the 2019-20 pool.</p>
<p>While many expect Cherington to act and use Monday’s trade deadline as a pivot point to a path for the Pirates’ future, it’s unlikely many thought Dyson — because of his struggles — would be the first to go.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, here we are, and the key takeaway from the trade is this: Center field will be an interesting position the rest of the way.</p>
<p>After transitioning to the outfield from shortstop at the beginning of this season, Cole Tucker has hardly looked out of place. He has earned himself more and more playing time, especially with how he’s handled himself at the plate.</p>
<p>While the 24-year-old is hardly a finished product, he has been playable with a .241/.274/.328 slash line. Tucker’s strikeout rate (23.8%) and walk rate (4.8%) could stand to improve, but the rest of the 2020 season should be the time to work on that stuff.</p>
<p>Tucker also needs to find comfort on taking control in center field, ranging to either side and reacting to plays off the wall.</p>
<p>There are also implications for the guy the Pirates claimed off waivers on Thursday — Anthony Alford. The former Blue Jay has speed, but he has never gotten much of a chance. Now, theoretically, that should come.</p>
<p>Alford has slashed .265/.358/.393 across 2,098 minor league plate appearances, but those numbers have shrunk to .188/.188/.375 across 46 games and 75 plate appearances in Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>Alford, a college quarterback, can certainly run, as evidenced by his 114 stolen bases in the minors. The question will be whether he can hit enough and add value defensively in the outfield.</p>
<p>But with Dyson gone and the Pirates preferring to give Gregory Polanco opportunities as their designated hitter, Alford should absolutely get a chance.</p>
<p>The news is less exciting for a couple of young outfielders the Pirates have at their alternate training site in Altoona — Jason Martin and Jared Oliva. Martin has been up briefly, only to fill a roster spot and pinch run, while Oliva was recently promoted to the taxi squad because of his exemplary work in Altoona.</p>
<p>This trade likely means less opportunity for those guys, although it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re marooned in the minors the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Good for Dyson, too. While he didn’t exactly make friends with his comments when he signed — “Ain’t too much out there right now,” he said — he’s absolutely the type of guy who can help a contender, which is what the White Sox are.</p>
<p>Dyson should give them a strong defender and a running threat. Plus, after winning a World Series ring with the Royals, his experience should help a young clubhouse.</p>
<p>The international bonus pool money matters to Cherington, too. He’s also several times about needing to prioritizing non-traditional signings to rebuild this Pirates, and this offers him flexibility in that department.</p>
<p><strong>Ponce returned</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates have optioned pitcher Cody Ponce back to their alternate training site in Altoona, according to the MLB transactions page. Ponce worked 5 2/3 scoreless innings Thursday in a 2-0 victory over the Cardinals at Busch Stadium, allowing five hits and two walks while striking out a pair in his first MLB start. Same as the Dyson trade, the team has not yet announced the move.</p>
