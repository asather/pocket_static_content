<h1>Washington County farm, owned by same family for more than 100 years, auctioned off for $847,000</h1>

<p>The audience planted in folding chairs beside a blue-striped tent listened intently Saturday as items ordinary as a tool box and unusual as an 1800s Studebaker Style Surrey&nbsp;— horse not included — were introduced, bid on and sold.</p>
<p>But noon’s approach meant that the main event in Eighty-Four — the reason many had come to this tranquil part of Washington County — finally was at hand. Joe R. Pyle, an auctioneer for 46 years, seemed to sense it was time to stoke anticipation among those in ball caps and flannel shirts, some there to make a serious bid and others just drawn to the spectacle.</p>
<p>“Walk through the house. It’s as original as you find in an old homestead here. It’s a fine, fine farm. It’s gonna have a hammer dropped on it at 12 o’clock today,” Mr. Pyle, 58, said through a sound system to the crowd of about 100. “So if you know someone interested, get ‘em on the phone, get ‘em here.”</p>
<p>A&nbsp; piece of Washington County history and one more family farm changed hands as property belonging to the late&nbsp;Raymond Patterson and his wife Mary Jane was auctioned off to the highest bidder. The sale included the home dating to 1794 and 128 rolling acres.</p>
<p>Acreage including the farmhouse, white with light green shutters, was the largest among hundreds of items sold by Mr. Pyle, founder and co-owner of Joe R. Pyle Complete Auction and Realty Service. He did his first auction at age 12 and can spew a fire hose of words and numbers so rapidly they blur together.</p>
<p>“ .... Can you give $20? Can you give $20? Can you give $20? ... “</p>
<p>Blink once and he’s rattled off a sentence. Or maybe two.</p>
<p>Developer Ted Taylor, of Peters, made the winning bid and is the farm’s new owner, his total including hammer price and buyer’s premium totaled $847,000. He walked up a slight hill to an information tent next to the farmhouse to sign paperwork and said afterward he’d like to divide the property into smaller parcels for homes one day.</p>
<p>Ms. Patterson, 80, the soon-to-be-former owner, stood not far away as her farm and belongings were sold before her eyes.</p>
<p>She expressed relief to have a buyer for acreage that had become too much to maintain but also seemed sad to&nbsp; part ways with a large chapter in her life.</p>
<p>“It’s like getting rid of your kids,” she said.</p>
<p>The property located at 71 Patterson Road is a 30-mile drive south from Pittsburgh in Nottingham Township. An online promotion posted in advance of Saturday’s auction included an aerial view of the farm’s sweeping landscape, a mix of wide spaces and trees.</p>
<p>“Opportunity awaits,” read the property listing by the the auction firm, which has other locations including its main Shinnston, W.Va., office.</p>
<p>The property has been in the family since 1895. It consists of a 3 bedroom, 2,376-square-foot dwelling and other buildings that include a bank barn with 20 horse stalls and was operated as a dairy farm and later as a place to care for and show Morgan horses.</p>
<p>Diana Jordan, 66, of Washington, called her friend Linda Moore, 64, of West Middletown, and told her she should come to the auction. As items changed hands behind them, they talked about why it was a good use of a Saturday.</p>
<p>“We go to a lot of acutions, and I recognized the name actually, Patterson, and I thought there would be a lot of antiques and older things,” said Ms. Jordan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though she had not put in any bids Saturday, she said, “I’m always ready to buy.”</p>
<p>Ms. Moore, too, noted the age of the house and potential for antiques —&nbsp;“things like that are a draw for me.”</p>
<p>Being outdoors on a sunny fall day wasn’t bad either.</p>
<p>Other structures on the farm include a Metal Pole Building, a Homestead Barn, Large Block Machine Shed and Office Building. There are storage sheds, too.</p>
<p>Personal items being sold Saturday, and found in a separate listing, included the Surrey, which sold for $900,&nbsp; as well as “Currier and Ives Sleigh, Antique Corner Cupboard, 1700’s Era Parlor Set —&nbsp;Settee, Chairs, Early Runner Sleds, Antique Corn Crib, Hand Tools, Saws, Craftsman Tools, Sockets, Drills, Galvanized Tubs, Farm Related Items,” according to an online Joe R. Pyle listing.</p>
<p>Mr. Pyle bantered with bidders as he nudged them not to give up, to stay in the bidding as the price rose. Opportunity knocks, he said at one point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a dove suddenly flew past the tent, he did not miss the opportunity for a tie-in.</p>
<p>“That dove is sending a signal,” he said to those in the audience who perhaps were on the fence about making an offer.&nbsp;“You should buy.”</p>
<p>As the creature flew off, Mr. Pyle suggested it was one more thing enjoyable about buying and selling under the auctioneer’s tent.</p>
<p>“You never know what’s gonna happen.”</p>
