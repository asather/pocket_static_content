<p>Who determines Top Workplaces? The best judges: the employees who work there.</p>
<p>For the 10th year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has partnered with Philadelphia-based Energage to rank Greater Pittsburgh’s Top Workplaces. The process is based on a scientific survey of employees who rate their workplace culture. It also gives company insights about what makes them unique.</p>
<p>“In times of great change, it is more important than ever to maintain a connection among employees,” said Energage CEO Eric Rubino. “When you give your employees a voice, you come together to navigate challenges and shape your path forward based on real-time insights into what works best for your organization.”</p>
<p>The process began in January, when the Post-Gazette began news coverage and promotions to welcome people to nominate companies as Top Workplaces. Energage also reached out to area companies. Throughout the process, 1,493 employers in the region were invited to have their employees take the survey. Any organization was eligible to participate, provided it had at least 50 employees in the region. Employers could be public, private, nonprofit or governmental. There is no cost to enter the Top Workplaces program.</p>
<p>For 2020, 136 employers agreed to take the survey. Combined, they employ 25,348 people in Greater Pittsburgh. Of those employees who received questionnaires, 15,303 responded, either on paper or online. For this year’s winners list, 92 Pittsburgh-area employers were ranked based on their employee survey feedback.</p>
<p>The employee engagement survey of 24 questions gathers responses regarding issues relating to workplace culture.</p>
<p>• Alignment: Where the company is headed, its values, cooperation, effective meetings.</p>
<p>• Coaching: Managers care about concerns, are helpful, encourage employee development</p>
<p>• Connection: Employees feel appreciated, work is meaningful, working at full potential, clued in to each other</p>
<p>• Engagement: Productivity, retention, recruiting</p>
<p>• Leadership: Confidence in company leaders</p>
<p>• Performance: Execution, open-mindedness, innovation, clued-in leadership</p>
<p>• The Basics: Pay, benefits, flexibility, training, expectations</p>
<p>Employers that score high enough are recognized as Top Workplaces. Employers are categorized by size, and they are ranked within those size groups to accurately compare results. Energage also determines special award winners based on standout scores on specific survey topics.</p>
<p>Did you look over the list and wonder why a particular company was not on it? It might be because it chose not to participate or because it did not score well enough in the survey process. Energage occasionally disqualifies employers based on questionable results detected through statistical tests it runs to ensure organizations are accurately administering the survey.</p>
