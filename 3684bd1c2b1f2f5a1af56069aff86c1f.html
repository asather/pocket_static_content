<h1>Homers, bullpen carry Pirates into deadline on positive note</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>MILWAUKEE — Sunday was more than likely the last time the Pirates will look like this and play a game, as the MLB trade deadline arrives Monday afternoon. Even if it’s small, general manager Ben Cherington will almost assuredly do <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>At least this group can say that it went out with a bang.</p>
<p>A couple, actually, including a blast from Josh Bell that dented the hood of a Toyota Highlander that was parked on the concourse beyond the right-center field fence here at Miller Park.</p>
<p>The Pirates used Bell’s homer, another from Gregory Polanco and six shutout innings from the bullpen to earn a 5-1 victory over the Brewers that gave Pittsburgh some good vibes during uncertain times.</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to hit that for three years now,” Bell said of his 428-foot homer off Brewers starter Brandon Woodruff.</p>
<p>“There’s going to be an unlucky fan with a dent in their hood whenever they get that car.”</p>
<p>Sunday’s win sets up a possible series split for the Pirates (10-21) on Monday, while it also snapped a seven-game losing streak for them in this building.</p>
<p>The day after the Pirates went 1-for-12 with runners in scoring position and left a season-high 11 runners on, Sunday was Milwaukee's turn; the Brewers went 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position and left 12 men on base.</p>
<p>In addition to Bell looking more like himself, a big takeaway from this one was the bullpen. A night after blowing two late leads, the Pirates got key contributions from several relievers in this one, including 2⅔ scoreless innings from Nick Tropeano, making his second appearance with Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Tropeano worked four scoreless innings last Tuesday in Chicago and continues to make a positive impression.</p>
<p>“He's attacking the zone with the fastball, slider and the split,” manager Derek Shelton said of Tropeano. “That's been the main thing. He's come right after hitters, and he's been effective with his offspeed stuff."</p>
<p>Another terrific effort came from Geoff Hartlieb, who relieved Tropeano in the seventh with two runners on. Although Hartlieb and the Pirates fell victim to a missed call from home-plate umpire CB Bucknor, Hartlieb regrouped and struck out Justin Smoak to end it.</p>
<p>(Bucknor missed Smoak's foul tip that John Ryan Murphy caught.)</p>
<p>Hartlieb, who has ditched his four-seamer while steadily improving his sinker-slider combo, picked up two more strikeouts in a scoreless eighth.</p>
<p>Richard Rodriguez — who served up the walk-off home run to Eric Sogard on Saturday — pitched a scoreless ninth.</p>
<p>“It was a fun one, for sure,” Hartlieb said. “We take a lot of pride in getting six [innings] out of us.”</p>
<p>That the Pirates did what they did against Woodruff was notable, as he hasn’t lost here since 2018. One important sequence came in the fifth inning, when Erik Gonzalez and Adam Frazier worked two-out walks, and Kevin Newman drove in the Pirates’ fourth run with a single.</p>
<p>It bucked a trend for Newman against the Brewers, as he began Sunday’s game hitless in 19 at-bats against them this season. (He’s hitting .324 versus everyone else.)</p>
<p>“Against a guy like Woody, that’s huge,” Frazier said of the Pirates driving up Woodruff’s pitch count. “It’s not an easy thing to do. I just wanted to follow [Gonzalez] with another tough at-bat and make it tough on [Woodruff].”</p>
<p>The Pirates did that with the homers, too. Woodruff came into Sunday’s game having allowed just three over seven starts, but Polanco snapped out of an 0-for-18 funk by jumping on a 2-2 change-up in the second inning.</p>
<p>Of Polanco’s nine hits this season, five have been homers.</p>
<p>Bell ambushed a four-seamer for his fourth homer of the season and second in as many games. It’s clear that things have slowed down for Bell, who continues to hit the ball hard. After a difficult first month, he’s starting to sync up to the fastball and hit for more power.</p>
<p>“It seemed like, at times, you could throw me a ball right down the middle, and I was mis-hitting it into the ground,” Bell said. “It doesn’t seem like that’s the case right now, so I’m just going to try to stay with where I’m at.”</p>
<p>Steven Brault racked up five strikeouts but had a tough time against a Brewers lineup that fouled off a lot of pitches — 15 in all. The extended at-bats drove up Brault’s pitch count, and he exited after three innings and 68 pitches.</p>
<p>Kyle Crick took over in the fourth, his first game action since July 27. And while he didn’t allow a run, his fastball velocity was a little down. After averaging 95.8 mph in 2018 and 95.3 mph a season ago, Crick’s four-seamer averaged just 91.1 mph Sunday.</p>
<p>The next few days will show whether there’s anything to be overly concerned about there, although by that time the Pirates could look much different, depending on what Cherington decides to do.</p>
<p>But, for now, the Pirates were plenty happy to see Bell’s mammoth swing, get a bounce-back effort from the bullpen and finally win a game at Miller Park.</p>
<p>“We’ve all been around it enough,” Brault said of the trade deadline. “It’s still a weird experience, but we’re kind of used to it. We’ll see what happens in the next 24 hours. Hopefully we’ll all be Pirates two days from now.”</p>
