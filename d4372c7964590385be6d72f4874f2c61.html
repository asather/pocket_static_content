<h1>Pirates injury updates: Good news for Jameson Taillon, Mitch Keller</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Slowly but surely, the Pirates are chipping away at the long list of names on their injured list.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, they reactivated right-hander <strong>Joe Musgrove</strong>, who went on the 10-day injured list with right triceps inflammation Aug. 11.</p>
<p>Fellow starting righties <strong>Jameson Taillon</strong> and <strong>Mitch Keller</strong> continue to make progress as well. Both are scheduled to throw live batting practice sessions Thursday at PNC Park, weather permitting.</p>
<p>The short-term plan for Keller, who is recovering from an oblique injury, is to throw two innings. The long-term plan is still to set him up for a return to baseball in 2020, even with just 28 games left on the Pirates’ schedule.</p>
<p>“The goal is to put him in an opportunity so [manager] Derek [Shelton] and staff can use him in a major league game,” said Todd Tomczyk, the Pirates’ director of sports medicine. “So by him throwing a live batting practice tomorrow, I think, should be an indication that that’s still our goal and our commitment.”</p>
<p>Taillon’s live batting practice is promising in his long return from his second Tommy John surgery. Last week, he threw his first live batting practice since his surgery. Throwing another one indicates the first went without complication.</p>
<p>What’s more, Tomczyk said he spoke to reporters immediately after a meeting to discuss when Taillon’s rehab is finished. Apparently, that time is nearing.&nbsp;By the end of the month, the Pirates plan on ramping down Taillon’s workload for the offseason, signifying that he is fully healthy again and ready to prepare as usual for the 2021 season.</p>
<p>“Ramp down overall volume, intensity of throwing,” Tomczyk said. “As we all know, Jameson, there is no ramping down with him. This guy, he’s just a student of the game, a student of his body. He just loves to compete, and he loves to find ways to get better and look to improve his skill set. I know that’s what he’ll do, and we’ll help him do it this offseason.”</p>
<p><strong>Musgrove’s return</strong></p>
<p>The aforementioned Musgrove was throwing a live batting practice session with Taillon in Altoona just last week. Now, he is back with the Pirates, starting against the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The Pirates, obviously, would not have placed Musgrove in that position if he weren’t healthy enough to do so. At the same time, as is understandable after a nearly month-long layoff, he’s not ready to match his output prior to the injury. That is, they are keeping a close eye on the amount of pitches and innings he throws at this point.</p>
<p>“I mean we’ll monitor his length,” Shelton said before Wednesday’s game. “He’s not going to be built up like he was regular —&nbsp;I shouldn’t say regular spring training because it wasn’t — but spring training 2.0. So he’s not fully lengthened out.”</p>
<p>Tomczyk was extremely complimentary of the way Musgrove attacked his rehabilitation, however, even if that can’t result to a fully stretched-out starting pitcher right away.</p>
<p>“Consummate professional in his rehab. He really met the challenges head-on. Again, we talked a couple weeks ago. We did not want little things to turn into big things at any time, and most notably in a shortened season like this,” Tomczyk said. “... We expect Joe to be Joe [Wednesday]. There are no limitations physically from that. You can never put any limitations on Joe, period. But how he’s utilized in game and pitch repertoire, it’s normal per Joe Musgrove and how the coaching staff and pitching staff desire.”</p>
<p><strong>Further injury updates</strong></p>
<p>At a different level of rehabilitation progress, right-handed relievers <strong>Keone Kela</strong> and <strong>Yacksel Rios</strong> seem to be a bit further from a return than Keller.</p>
<p>As of last week, Kela, the Pirates’ closer, had not picked up a baseball, as he still felt tightness in his throwing arm. Now, though, Tomczyk says he has thrown from flat ground, with long toss up to 120 feet, and that tightness has begun to subside.</p>
<p>Rios (right shoulder inflammation) is in a similar position, throwing off flat ground up to 120 feet, with some more intense throwing at a shorter range.</p>
<p>Tomczyk said the next step for them is to throw bullpen sessions off the mound.</p>
<p>Infielder <strong>Phillip Evans</strong>, after having surgery last week to repair a broken jaw, has had one of the wires in his jaw removed, though it does still remain wired shut.</p>
<p>“I know he’s looking forward to eating solid foods and making sure that his jaw is nice and sturdy,” Tomczyk said.</p>
