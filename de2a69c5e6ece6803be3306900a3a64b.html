<h1>Penguins on pause: Brian Dumoulin's absence underscores his value </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, Brian Dumoulin’s contributions to the Penguins might be easy to overlook.</p>
<p>By the nature of his position and his stay-at-home style, the 28-year-old defenseman isn’t going to rack up a ton points or produce many highlight-reel plays. He’s never scored more than five goals in a season, never tallied more than 23 points.</p>
<p>But this year, when he recorded just eight points in 28 games, Dumoulin provided a clear reminder of his value. And he did it from an unexpected place: the press box.</p>
<p>On Nov. 30 in St. Louis, Dumoulin lacerated tendons in his left ankle when Blues forward Zach Sanford fell onto the back of his legs. The surgery and subsequent rehab left the Penguins without their best left-handed defenseman for three months.</p>
<p>His absence was obvious. The Penguins were forced into less-than-optimal defensive pairings. Initially, the club briefly played Kris Letang on his left side with rookie John Marino. When that didn’t work, the two right-handed defensemen flipped sides. Eventually, Letang played for a big chunk of the stretch with Jack Johnson, who started the year in a three-man rotation on the third pairing.</p>
<p>As a result, Letang’s performance suffered. When he and Dumoulin are on the ice together, their chemistry and complementary skillsets make up an ideal top pairing. Letang can take some more chances and use his offensive instincts, knowing Dumoulin is there to cover. Without Dumoulin, Letang’s gambles were often magnified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stats back it up. With Dumoulin, Letang’s shot share was an impressive 58.13% during five-on-five play. Without? Just 49.69%.</p>
<p>In the offensive zone, Letang was on the ice for 12.14 high-danger chances per 60 minutes with Dumoulin, compared to 10.54 without his regular partner. Defensively, Letang was on the ice for 10.82 of the opponents’ high-danger chances per 60 without Dumoulin, compared to 9.95 with Dumoulin.</p>
<p>So while Dumoulin’s play might go overlooked when he’s on the ice, it’s pretty clear what the Penguins are missing when he’s not there.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> Dumoulin returned to the Penguins lineup on March 3, the same day Marino returned from his own injury. They immediately made their presence felt during a 7-3 rout of the Ottawa Senators. With the pairings back to normal, the Penguins looked like a more complete defensive team.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> In the 24 games with Dumoulin, Letang averaged .333 goals per game, .79 points and a plus-5 rating. Without Dumoulin, Letang averaged .19 goals per game, .68 points per game and complied a minus-5 rating.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong>&nbsp;Dumoulin was healthy enough to return for the final five games before the season was officially “paused.” But the extra time off can only help him continue to put a serious injury in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Dumoulin is signed with the Penguins through the 2022-23 season with a contract that carries an average annual value of $4.1 million. Clearly, he’s the top left-handed defenseman on the team and should be in the top pairing for years to come.</p>
