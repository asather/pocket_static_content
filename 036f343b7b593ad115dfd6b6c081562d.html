<h1>Health restrictions push wedding receptions into backyards or next year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After 10 years together, Sarah Yonash, 38, and Brandon Crusan, 39, were looking forward to having a large wedding reception last Friday, complete with a bar, dance floor and 138 of their closest friends and family.</p>
<p>The couple from Mount Washington had a small ceremony Wednesday at St. Gertrude’s Parish in Vandergrift. But their reception will have to wait until June 2021. They have&nbsp;reserved a date at the Wyndham Grand Hotel in Downtown.</p>

<p>The last several weeks have been a whirlwind for local brides and grooms.&nbsp;When the Allegheny County Health Department banned on-site alcohol consumption as of June 30 and announced a week-long restriction on large gatherings beginning July 3, couples were forced to change their plans on short notice — and probably not for the first time.</p>
<p>“The most important part is that we will be married, but it’s not how any girl dreams of her wedding,” said Ms. Yonash, who is holding onto decor with her original July 10 wedding date.</p>
<p>Brittani Graham, 32, and Brandon Baker, 33, of East Liberty, had prepaid for a wedding on March 22. When COVID-19 shut down restaurants and bars, they postponed it until the end of June. Then they rescheduled for Aug. 9.</p>
<p>“I was really hopeful for August 9,” Ms. Graham said. “It seemed really far out when all of this began.”</p>
<p>But following Allegheny County’s restrictions on gatherings of more than 25 people, the couple postponed their wedding reception indefinitely.&nbsp;Most of their family members live in North Carolina and it’s currently recommended that travelers coming from that state self-quarantine for 14 days upon arriving in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;Ms. Graham is trying to get a refund on the food, linens and other items she had ordered.</p>
<p>The couple now is planning a small backyard ceremony in August with immediate family and is considering streaming the ceremony to those who are unable to attend.</p>
<p>Backyard ceremonies have become popular for couples who want to celebrate now but are saving their big event for 2021. No matter what phase of reopening Allegheny County is in, some couples simply aren’t comfortable having a large gathering until there is a vaccine for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Maddy Mulert, 25, and Scott Stewart, 27, are living in Boston but grew up in Aspinwall. They had scheduled a wedding reception in September at the University Club but have rescheduled it for October 2021. The couple is planning a small backyard ceremony in Fox Chapel on Sept. 11.</p>
<p>“Public health is much bigger than our wedding,” Ms. Mulert said. “This is just one day. We’ll be together forever, so this can wait.”</p>
<p>Like many couples, they have guests coming in from out of town — as far as Spain — and are hoping that switching dates will allow their loved ones to comfortably make the trip.</p>
<p>“Having a reception with 100-plus people is not going to be fun unless everyone’s comfortable and people in at-risk groups are safe,” Mr. Stewart said.</p>
<p>Managers of wedding venues and vendors also are scrambling. Venues adhere to the same rules as bars and restaurants, which means that they currently can accommodate only 25 guests indoors or 50 guests outdoors. Food and alcohol can only be served outdoors with a maximum three drinks per guest.</p>
<p>Some couples have moved their weddings to counties other than Allegheny so they can serve food or maintain their original guest list.</p>
<p>“For couples, when there’s a will, there’s a way,” said Katlyn Doolin, who manages Bethel Bakery’s wedding department.&nbsp;“Couples are trying to problem-solve. That often means moving outside of Allegheny County where the restrictions better suit their event.”</p>
<p>One couple canceled a bridal shower at The Foundry Table &amp; Tap on the North Shore on July 5 with only 48 hours notice, according to owner Andrew Stackiewicz.&nbsp;The Foundry catered a backyard wedding this past Saturday that originally was booked at the venue but exceeded the 25-guest maximum.</p>
<p>“Many of my couples are hesitant about making decisions until they get information, and without a lot of information, it’s frustrating,” he said. “Strict timetables would make things a lot easier.”</p>
<p>“It’s challenging to get lumped in with [bars and restaurants],” Ms. Doolin said. “The truth of the matter is that [weddings] are an entirely different animal. If you’ve spent tens of thousands of dollars on an event and you have less than 24 hours’ notice that you’re now closed down, that’s tragic.”</p>
<p>Ms. Doolin has been calling couples in Allegheny County with approaching wedding dates to go over their options.</p>
<p>“The best thing that I can say to couples is to keep hope and to know that the vendors they’ve hired are in this with them,” she said. “We desperately want these events to happen as much as they do, and we’re willing to move heaven and earth to make it happen.”</p>
