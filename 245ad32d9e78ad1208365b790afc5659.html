<h1>Pandemic can't derail the honoring of Flight 93 heroes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>STONEYCREEK — The bowed heads and solemnity of America’s two presidential candidates, the majestic ringing of bells and inspiring words from family members who lost loved ones on United Airlines Flight 93, marked the 19th anniversary of 9/11 on Friday in a way that social distancing and masks couldn’t derail.</p>
<p>Although it was abbreviated in length and limited in size due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s ceremony at the Flight 93 Memorial in Somerset County succeeded in maintaining many of the traditions of anniversaries past — orchestrated to honor and remember the 40 crew members and passengers who fought back in 2001 against hijackers and were ultimately killed when they forced the plane down in an empty field.</p>
<p>The morning ceremony — not open to the public this year — managed to hold onto its somber grandeur, as overcast skies and cool breezes were interrupted only by bagpipe music, speeches, bells and the voice of President Donald Trump, barely above a whisper.</p>
<p>With First Lady Melania Trump looking on from behind the podium, Mr. Trump recited a 15-minute written speech that recalled the chronology of events on Flight 93, commemorated those who mounted an offensive on the plane and praised the American people for banding together in the aftermath.</p>
<p>“The heroes of Flight 93 are an everlasting reminder that no matter the danger, no matter the threat, no matter the odds, America will always rise up, stand tall and fight back,” Mr. Trump said, insisting that the 40 passengers and crew members “are forever inscribed in the eternal roll call of American heroes.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump painted a picture of what it was like in the skies of Shanksville on Sept. 11, where “the only thing that stood between the enemy and a deadly strike at the heart of American democracy was the courage and resolve of 40 men and women,” he said.</p>
<p>After the crash in Shanksville and the attacks on New York City and at the Pentagon, America was a country unified by love, care, pride in the flag, gratitude for police and first responders, faith in God and a “refusal to bend our will” to violence, intimidation and evil, Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p>And now, “our sacred task, righteous duty and solemn pledge is to carry forward the noble legacy of the brave souls who gave their lives for us 19 years ago,” the president added.</p>
<p>The names of the 40 people who Mr. Trump said "gave their lives in defense of our nation" on Flight 93 were read slowly, one by one, accompanied by the ringing of two bells — one big, one small and both of different pitches.</p>

<p>The ceremony, titled “Moment of Remembrance,” was designed to be just that: a moment. Taking in the program was a crowd of more than 100 seated in folding chairs in socially-distanced rows, many of whom were family members of lost passengers or crew members. The stage was perched in front of the Wall of Names — a series of 40 white marble panels inscribed with the names of those who were killed.</p>
<p>At 9:52 a.m., Stephen Clark, superintendent of the memorial, remarked that it was around that time, 19 years ago, that the 40 individuals on the plane —&nbsp;many of whom knew the World Trade Center and Pentagon had been struck by airliners —&nbsp;“were coming to the realization and formulating a plan that they needed to take action.”</p>
<p>“Galvanized by this information, these strangers came together in this national moment of uncertainty,” Mr. Clark said. “Their choice to make a difference that morning has continued to resonate with people around the globe.”</p>
<p>After the speeches concluded, the president and first lady descended the stage with Ed Root, the cousin of Flight 93 flight attendant Lorraine G. Bay, and his wife, Nancy. As “Amazing Grace” played, the four stood before a large wreath with flowers and a white bow. Bowing their heads, they took a moment of silence near the Wall of Names.</p>

<p>A few hours later, after park rangers had cleaned up most of the ceremony stage and the public started to stream in, the Wall of Names got a visit from Joe Biden, the former vice president and current Democratic presidential contender. Accompanying him was his wife, Jill, and the two arrived by motorcade to pay their respects after they had visited ceremonies in New York earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden brought a wreath of white flowers and placed it at the memorial, then met with the families of LeRoy Homer Jr., Loraine Bay and Louis Nacke — posing for photos and spending time talking with each.</p>
<p>“When you think about what happened [on Flight 93], it’s one thing to react when you’re in a situation where you’re confronted with something and you have to act immediately. It’s another thing to consciously know that what you’re about to do is likely to cost you your life,” Mr. Biden remarked to reporters. “That is an incredible, incredible thing.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, remarking on the sacrifices that Americans made for their country after Sept. 11, said so many “signed up knowing they were going to put on desert boots and head into Iraq or Afghanistan” —&nbsp;including his son, Beau.</p>
<p>“These are people that didn’t have to go. They volunteered. They volunteered,” Mr. Biden said, “and they’re all heroes. This idea: don’t ever underestimate [that] one of the marks of being an American is understanding there’s some things that are bigger and more important than yourself.”</p>
<p>The memorial grounds were closed from Thursday at sunset to the end of the ceremony Friday morning, in an effort to minimize crowds. Meeting visitors was a sign from the National Park Service that read, “Please Keep a Safe Distance,” “Mask Up” and “Wash Hands,” and a table was set up for free masks.</p>
<p>D. Hamilton Peterson — whose parents, Donald and Jean Peterson, were killed aboard Flight 93 — said the event was “flawless,” and that the level of intimacy and being able to spend time with ambassadors “was a unique experience that probably can never be replicated.”</p>
<p>Like other families, Mr. Peterson — joined by his 20-year-old son, Peyton — walked out into the field after the ceremony to see the wreckage site, which he called “heart wrenching yet beautiful.”</p>
<p>Mr. Peterson applauded Mr. Trump for his speech and the level of nuance and understanding the president showed.</p>
<p>“He clearly had in mind that today was about honoring the heroes, the passengers and crew,” Mr. Peterson said. “It was not about politics, and he was a complete gentleman in that regard.”</p>
