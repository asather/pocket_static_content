<html><head><title> Iran vows revenge for attack </title></head><body><p>BAGHDAD — Iran promised to seek revenge for a U.S. airstrike near Baghdad’s airport that killed the mastermind of its interventions across the Middle East, and the U.S. said Friday that it was sending thousands more troops to the region as tensions soared in the wake of the targeted killing.</p><p>The death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, marks a major escalation in the standoff between Washington and Tehran, which has careened from one crisis to another since President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and imposed crippling sanctions.</p><p>Almost 24 hours after the attack on Gen. Soleimani, another airstrike killed five members of an Iranian-backed militia north of Baghdad, an Iraqi security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.</p><p>Iranian-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces confirmed the strike, saying it hit one of its medical convoys near the stadium in Taji but didn’t kill any of its top leaders.</p><p>The American military did not carry out the reported attack, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>The targeted strike against Gen. Soleimani and any retaliation by Iran could ignite a conflict that engulfs the whole region, endangering U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria and beyond. Over the last two decades, Gen. Soleimani had assembled a network of heavily armed allies stretching all the way to southern Lebanon, on Israel’s doorstep.</p><p>The United States said it was sending nearly 3,000 more troops to the Middle East, reflecting concern about potential Iranian retaliation. The U.S. also urged Americans to leave Iraq immediately following the airstrike at Baghdad’s international airport that Iran’s state TV said killed Gen. Soleimani and nine others.</p><p>The State Department said the embassy in Baghdad, which was attacked by Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters earlier this week, is closed and all consular services have been suspended.</p><p>A Pentagon official who was not authorized to speak publicly said the U.S. also had placed an Army brigade on alert to fly into Lebanon to protect the American Embassy. U.S. embassies also issued a security alert for Americans in Bahrain, Kuwait and Nigeria.</p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2020/01/04/Iran-vows-revenge-for-attack/stories/202001050111</original_url>
