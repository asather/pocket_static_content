<h1>Miss Manners: Are there times I can skip thanking people?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>DEAR MISS MANNERS:</strong> We lost everything (including our pets) in a house fire two years ago. We were devastated, as nothing was recoverable. Many people helped with money, blankets, clothing, a GoFundMe page, etc.</p>
<p>Then my husband lost his job in early June, and was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.</p>
<p>Was I supposed to send thank-you notes to all who sent money and provided financial help during the time after the fire? It went from one bad event to the next. Are there some circumstances where a thank-you card can be overlooked? Am I ungrateful?</p>
<p><strong>GENTLE READER:</strong> Apparently. With all the terrible luck you have had, you are ignoring your good fortune in having people who care enough to help you.</p>
<p>Are you truly not grateful to them? And do you not want to encourage such kindness by telling them how much it meant to you?</p>
<p>Miss Manners can understand that you are focused on the bad things that have happened to you. But it would do you good to look at the kinder side, as well. Expressing thanks is not just a chore to repay a debt, but a reminder of not having to suffer alone.</p>
<p><strong>DEAR MISS MANNERS:</strong> Some time ago, I received a letter from a friend stating that she was hurt that I did not attend her wedding. She wanted an explanation of why I didn't attend, especially since she had attended my wedding several years before.</p>
<p>I replied with a letter of apology, noting that traveling for her wedding was not feasible at that time in my life due to a number of factors, including limited finances. The friend accepted my letter and apology, but told me that I "owe her a trip to visit her next year" and to "start planning." I told her that I very much want to visit someday in the future, but did not commit to a time frame.</p>
<p>What do I say when she comes calling next year to ask me to make a trip to see her? Amidst other family travel obligations, her trip is low on my priority list and unlikely to happen in the next couple years â€” especially with a new baby in my household. I feel as though I am being held hostage until I prove my friendship with an expensive visit.</p>
<p><strong>GENTLE READER:</strong> Your friend is trying to say that she has forgiven you and wants to resume the friendship. It is just that she has chosen a particularly awkward way to do so.</p>
<p>That baby is a long-term excuse, which Miss Manners recommends pairing with another expression of interest in the friendship: "It's been far too long, but Dalia makes travel complicated [insert amusing story of tending to Dalia's needs on a family trip]. Any chance of you and Lyle coming this way? The guest room is now the nursery, but I'd love to see as much of you as I can."</p>
