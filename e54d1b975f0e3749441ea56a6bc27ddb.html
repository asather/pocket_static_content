<h1>Investigation of Allegheny County plumbing inspections continues</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As Allegheny County police pursue an investigation of falsified plumbing inspections, the Pittsburgh Water &amp; Sewer Authority has pledged its cooperation.</p>
<p>Police said they&nbsp;served a search warrant for records at Matt Mertz Plumbing on Peoples Road in Ross in connection with the arrest of two county plumbing inspectors and are going through the records recovered.</p>
<p>County police Inspector Michael Peairs said Friday that it’s too early to tell if the scheme outlined in complaints against the two inspectors charged was widespread or not, or whether other inspectors were involved. The county employs 13 plumbing inspectors.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at everything,” he said. “It will take some time.”</p>
<p>Matt Mertz Plumbing declined to comment Friday on any aspect of the investigation.</p>
<p>Two inspectors, Michael Kevin O’Toole, 57, of Pittsburgh, and Timothy Chelosky, 53, of McKeesport, were charged Thursday with falsifying plumbing inspections. They were arraigned and released on their own recognizance. They could not be reached for comment and court records did not list attorneys for them.</p>
<p>They have been suspended pending an internal investigation.</p>
<p>The county health department had requested assistance from county police regarding several plumbing inspectors possibly falsifying inspections and taking bribes, according to a criminal complaint. On July 2, detectives met with plumbing program manager Ivo Miller, who told police that he had found patterns of inspectors scheduling inspections from outside their assigned areas and completing them outside of normal work hours on days they were off, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller told police some of the inspection photos had different dates than when the inspection was reported and others were photos taken of a picture displayed on another electronic or cellular device. Mr. Miller also told police he observed this behavior specifically with Mr. O’Toole and Mr. Chelosky, stating they both used their personal cellphones for scheduling inspections and that “the overwhelming majority” of them were requested by Matt Mertz Plumbing Inc., according to the complaint.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Mr. Miller told police, he went to inspect a Pittsburgh Water &amp; Sewer Authority lead water line replacement along Beechwood Boulevard and was met there by a person identified as Brian Tarr, who was working for Matt Mertz Plumbing. Mr. Miller told police when he discovered Mr. Tarr did not have a plumbing license, as required by law, Mr. Tarr told him that some of the county plumbing inspectors were being paid off to allow this and other “inappropriate/illegal behavior” and that no inspectors had been coming to these jobs while Mr. Tarr had been working on them.</p>
<p>The PWSA on Friday issued a statement:</p>
<p>“PWSA takes extensive measures to inspect and document all contracted construction work. All PWSA projects include a construction inspection firm to oversee, photograph, and report construction work from beginning to end, independent of the County inspection. The PWSA project team reviews and maintains documentation of all work completed by our contractors —&nbsp;we are confident that the work completed by our contractors meets our requirements and the appropriate codes.</p>
<p>“We will cooperate with all involved parties to provide any needed documentation regarding sites where inspections by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) may not have been properly completed.</p>
<p>“PWSA was made aware of the charges brought against ACHD inspectors on the evening of September 10th and immediately began reviewing construction records where plumbing inspections were completed by the individuals who were charged or by the plumbing company that was implicated. PWSA’s lead service line replacement contractors use plumbing companies to complete private plumbing work when a lead line is replaced on private property. Per the plumbing code, this work is inspected by ACHD.”</p>
<p>County spokeswoman Amie Downs said county plumbing inspectors are called out to inspect any plumbing work that has been done in the county except work that is maintained by a municipal authority. They are also called out for complaints regarding plumbing issues.</p>
<p>Inspectors are called out for big and small jobs and they inspect both commercial and residential sites.</p>
<p>They look at sewage lines, water lines and potable water lines but do not inspect gas lines.</p>
<p>Each inspector averages around 3,000 inspections a year, Ms. Downs said. In total, approximately 40,000 plumbing inspections are conducted throughout the county each year.</p>
