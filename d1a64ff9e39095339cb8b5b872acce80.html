<h1>AHN develops process to sterilize, recycle scarce N95 masks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny Health Network has implemented a new sterilization process for the medical-grade N95 respiratory masks that will allow them to be reused multiple times.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, AHN began sterilizing the masks using in-house equipment that typically is reserved for sterilizing surgical instruments. The equipment is available because AHN has postponed elective surgeries at its nine surgical hospitals to conserve resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>With sterilization, N95 masks, which typically would be thrown away at the end of a shift, can be recycled twice for a total of three uses.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has temporarily authorized mask sterilization in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and AHN had recently received approval from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for its specific process for collecting the masks, sterilizing them, and then redistributing them.</p>
<p>“With masks and other kinds of personal protective equipment in short supply, AHN and Highmark Health have been working tirelessly to ensure that our patients are safe and that our clinical employees always have the protective equipment they need,” said Sricharan Chalikonda, chief medical operations officer for AHN.</p>
<p>The mask sterilization will take place at each of AHN’s nine surgical hospitals with two machines each at Allegheny General Hospital on North Side and West Penn Hospital in Bloomfield, and one each at Forbes Hospital in Monroeville, Allegheny Valley Hospital in Natrona Heights, Canonsburg Hospital in Washington County, Saint Vincent Hospital in Erie and Grove City Medical Center in Mercer County. Up to 40 masks can be processed in the 45-minute sterilization process with the two machines at each site sterilizing about 15 loads per day. Collectively, AHN officials say they could recycle more than 6,000 masks per day.</p>
<p>The health network collaborated with Pittsburgh-based MSA Safety to ensure the masks meet performance requirements following sterilization.</p>
<p>A shortage of N95 masks and other personal protection equipment, or PPE, has become a major concern in COVID hot spots such as New York City and New Orleans as providers, sometimes working multiple shifts, say they feel like they’re putting their own lives at risk while caring for patients.</p>
<p>The N95 respirator masks are a specialized mask that fits tightly around the face, offering better protection from airborne particles.</p>
<p>Because of the limited supply, federal officials have said the N95 masks should be reserved for health care providers and other first responders while cloth masks are adequate for the general public.</p>
