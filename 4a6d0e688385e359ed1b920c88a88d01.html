<h1>Catch and release of early trout is legal on some waters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On an unseasonably warm Sunday afternoon in early March — 60 degrees and sunny skies&nbsp;— Bob Segal confidently flips a jig into North Park Lake, silently counting its rate of descent before reeling.</p>
<p>Six weeks until the April 18 statewide opening of trout season and 18 days before a big Fish and Boat Commission trout stocking, the lifelong fisherman is already targeting trout. He has thrown back six since a special-regulation season opened March 1, he says, including two rainbows in the 13-inch range that were released within the hour.</p>
<p>It’s all legal in 41 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties on designated waters such as North Park Lake, managed under the <a href="https://pfbc.pa.gov/fishpub/summaryad/yearround.html" target="_blank">Stocked Trout Waters Open for Year-Round Fishing</a> program.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch to the catch-and-release rule. After release, the trout may not die.</p>
<p>Design/development: XXXXXXX/Post-Gazette</p>
<p>When the special regulation debuted about 10 years ago, it replaced a 31-day early season that permitted fishing for legal game species on some trout-stocked waters in the weeks prior to the season opener. Trout that were mistakenly caught had to be released.</p>
<p>The current rule applies year-round for game species and permits the use of all tackle. It conforms to standard and extended-season trout regulations with the exception of the six weeks prior to the opening of trout season.</p>
<p>“These waters are open to fishing from March 1 to opening day of trout season; however, no trout may be taken or possessed on these waters during this period,” states the regulation.</p>
<p>Mike Parker, Fish and Boat spokesman, says “taken or possessed” means that after removal of the hook the fish remains in some way restrained.</p>
<p>“Put it on a stringer, put it in a bucket or livewell or just throw it on the ground out of the water and the [trout] has been taken or possessed,” he says. “That would be illegal.”</p>
<p>The regulation continues:&nbsp;“A trout/salmon permit is not required to fish in lakes and ponds that have been designated as Stocked Trout Waters Open to Year-Round Fishing unless the person takes, kills or possesses, while in the act of fishing, a trout or salmon on or in these waters.”</p>
<p>Takes,<em> kills</em> or possesses? Suppose an angler on these waters has a general fishing license and trout stamp, lawfully catches and releases a trout, but a few minutes later it floats belly up.</p>
<p>“If that trout is released but ends up floating in the lake shortly thereafter, we could certainly investigate and pursue prosecution,” says Mr. Parker. “All incidents pursued are on a case-by-case basis, but it would likely take a blatant abuse of the regulation to warrant prosecution.”</p>
<p>It would be difficult, he says, to determine if an angler was responsible for the death of a trout legally caught and released in those waters. A Wildlife Conservation Officer could witness mistreatment of the trout by an angler, which led to the fish's death, or an eyewitness could report an angler who kept a trout out of the water for a lethal period of time, taking photos, for example.</p>
<p>“If you are going to fish in one of these areas, there’s a lot of responsibility on the angler to use caution,” says Mr. Parker. “While you are allowed to fish for trout, you must release them unharmed immediately.”</p>
<p>Considering the complications in Stocked Trout Open to Year-Round Fishing regulation, having a trout stamp is recommended.</p>
<p>Fisherman Scott Karavlan of McCandless says that despite the risk, year-round fishing on the program’s mostly suburban impoundments has obvious advantages. He uses the March and early-April catch-and-release trout requirement at North Park Lake to help teach his children, Logan, 12, and twins Ronan and Rose, 10, about the importance of safe fish handling and wildlife conservation.</p>
<p>“I believe that American anglers are some of our nation’s best conservationists. Without fish to catch it’s hard to create new anglers,” he says. “I’d be lying if I said I don’t worry about the survival rate of fish released, but I believe with proper handling even fish caught with [live] bait can survive.”</p>
<p>Mr. Karavlan says many kids, including his, have schedules loaded with school and athletic obligations.</p>
<p>“Allowing year-round fishing on specific waters allows me more opportunities to fish with my sons and daughter throughout the year whenever we can find the time,” he says.</p>
<p>The rule is a little different on rivers and streams enrolled in the program. From March 1 through April 18, a trout stamp is required whether you hook a trout or not.</p>
<p>Statewide, 74 lakes and sections of rivers and streams are included in the Stocked Trout Waters Open for Year-Round Fishing program. <a href="https://fbweb.pa.gov/stocking/TroutStockingDetails_GIS.aspx" target="_blank">Fish and Boat trout stocking schedules</a> show those lakes in Allegheny and adjacent counties will start getting fish in two weeks. Allegheny County: North Park Lake, March 26. Beaver County: Bradys Run Lake, April 15; Raccoon Lake, April 16. Washington County: Canonsburg Lake, March 27. Westmoreland County: Keystone Lake, March 25; Northmoreland Lake, April 3; Twin Lakes (upper and lower), March 30.</p>
