<h1>Pittsburgh-area groups deliver list of demands on police reform to local officials</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Several Pittsburgh-area groups delivered a dozen demands for police reform to city and Allegheny County officials on Monday.</p>
<p>Among their demands: that Pittsburgh police union president Robert&nbsp;Swartzwelder step down.</p>
<p>Activists from the groups — which&nbsp;include 1Hood, Take Action Mon Valley, the Alliance for Police Accountability and Okra Ethics —&nbsp;also said they want government funds reallocated from public safety and invested instead into communities.</p>
<p>"The safest communities are not the ones with the most police but the ones with the most resources," said Jasiri X, of the group 1Hood.</p>
<p>"Reform and training [of police] aren't going to make our communities safer," said Miracle Jones, also of 1Hood.</p>
<p>The full list of demands include:</p>
<p>1. Defund the police and fund black communities</p>
<p>2. Demilitarize police</p>
<p>3. End the criminalization of black people</p>
<p>4. Remove police from schools</p>
<p>5. Make all collective bargaining with police public</p>
<p>6. Terminate FOP president Robert Swartzwelder</p>
<p>7. Disband all private police departments</p>
<p>8. End no-knock warrants</p>
<p>9. Cease partnership with ICE</p>
<p>10. End cash bail</p>
<p>11. Release all vulnerable individuals from jail</p>
<p>12. Create an independent, fully funded police review board</p>
<p>Brandi Fisher, head of the Alliance for Police Accountability, said budgets are a municipality's "moral document."</p>
<p>Allocating the majority of funds for public safety "shows us that your priority is to lock people up," she said.</p>
