<p>The next commercial space crew launch is scheduled for Aug. 30 or early September. The SpaceX Crew-1 mission will be the first official launch of the Crew Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station. The May 30 launch of the Demo-2 mission was a test flight for the Crew Dragon capsule and saw a successful launch and docking to the ISS with its astronauts, Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken. With the data gathered by the test mission, SpaceX will be ready to launch its first official crew flight.</p>
<p>Crew-1 will carry NASA astronauts Shannon Walker, Victor Glover Jr. and Mike Hopkins, as well as JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi from Japan. The members of Crew-1 will go on to join the crew aboard the ISS as Expedition 64. Like Demo-2, this flight will utilize SpaceXâ€™s Crew Dragon spacecraft atop the Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
