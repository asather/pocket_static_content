<h1>Mike Vellucci on the AHL canceling its season and what it means for Penguins prospects</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The American Hockey League announced Monday it had canceled the rest of the 2019-20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time since its debut in 1937, the Calder Cup will not be handed to the AHL champs.</p>
<p>Mike Vellucci is disappointed, obviously, but the news was no surprise.</p>
<p>“I’m probably not supposed to say it, but I was figuring the American League was canceling for a while here,” the first-year coach of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins said Monday afternoon. “I just didn’t know how it would work, getting players back and all that. I kind of had the feeling this was coming.”</p>
<p>On March 11, the night the sports world started to shut down, Vellucci coached Pittsburgh’s AHL affiliate to an overtime win over rival Lehigh Valley. Right around the time that Riley Barber buried the game-winner, the NBA was pulling players off the court and soon announced its season had been suspended.</p>
<p>The next morning, when his concerned players began trickling into their team facility in Wilkes-Barre, Vellucci decided to call off an 11 a.m. practice.</p>
<p>“I could see it in their eyes,” said Vellucci, who also holds general manager duties for the AHL club. “Nobody [in the AHL] had canceled anything yet, but I knew we weren’t going to accomplish anything. Their heads were elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Later that day, the news came down that the NHL and AHL were both suspending their season. Wilkes-Barre/Scranton players began to scatter across the globe. Vellucci, a Michigan native who last year coached the Charlotte Checkers to their first Calder Cup, returned to his home in Detroit to be with family.</p>
<p>The writing has been on the wall for the AHL season for weeks now. Unlike the NHL, which gets a sizable chunk of change from broadcast rights, the AHL’s clubs largely rely on ticket sales and corporate sponsorships to stay afloat.</p>
<p>So flying players back to their AHL cities and trying to play games without paying customers in the bleachers wouldn’t have made much sense for the AHL, especially considering that a handful of other clubs are independently owned.</p>
<p>Given that landscape, the AHL is turning its attention toward 2020-21.</p>
<p>“While the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins are disappointed we won’t be able to finish the season, the health of our players, employees and most importantly our fans must take precedence at this time,” a team statement read.</p>
<p>From a team standpoint, Vellucci said it is a “bummer” that the 2019-20 season will not resume. The AHL club had 13 games left on the schedule and a long-shot chance at a playoff berth. But in terms of individual prospect development, the veteran coach doesn’t believe it is a big deal for most of his players.</p>
<p>“The guys that played with me all year long, I don’t think there’s anything lost because they played in so many big minutes throughout the year,” he said.</p>
<p>Vellucci said the cancellation of the season will have a much greater impact on newly signed prospects like Drew O’Connor, the Dartmouth standout who joined the organization as a college free agent in March. The big forward was supposed to get his first taste of the AHL but he now must wait for 2020-21.</p>
<p>“That’s definitely a downer for them. It’s such an eye-opener for guys coming out of college or junior to play some AHL games,” he said. “I know when I coached junior, all the guys were like, ‘I’m going straight to the NHL.’ I don’t think they really understand how hard and how good the American League is.”</p>
<p>All that said, Vellucci is encouraged by blue-line prospect Pierre-Olivier Joseph and forward Sam Miletic, the latter of whom represented the Penguins at the AHL All-Star Classic. Late-round picks Niclas Almari and Jan Drozg flashed potential. Jon Lizotte, an undrafted defenseman, surprised with his steady play.</p>
<p>Vellucci pointed out that several players scored their first AHL goals.</p>
<p>“We didn’t shield [the youngsters] at all,” he said. “They played a lot.”</p>
<p>Not that they had a choice. Pittsburgh battled injuries all season and plugged holes with guys expected to be important players for Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, such as Sam Lafferty. The AHL club had poor injury luck, too. Plus, the organization lost on waivers two key AHLers in Stefan Noesen and Andrew Agozzino.</p>
<p>As a result, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton struggled to score. When the season was called off, their .524 points percentage was sixth in their eight-team division.</p>
<p>“Did I think we were going to do better? Yes. But with all the injuries and call-ups, it was crazy what was going on. We had nine, 10 guys out of our lineup at one time,” Vellucci said. “But I really liked the development of the young guys. A lot of them came a long way and played in a lot of key situations.”</p>
<p>After the AHL went on hiatus March 12, he continued to coach up Penguins prospects. The coaching staff spliced together video clips and has used Zoom to chat with them about their season and the next steps in their development.</p>
<p>“Let’s use P.O. Joseph as an example,” he said. “We’re cutting up clips of NHL players like [Brian] Dumoulin and Jaccob Slavin and anybody else we think he plays like, and we’re showing him clips and trying to get better even though we’re not on the ice. We’re trying to work with players and get them better.”</p>
<p>Who knows when Vellucci will get to see the results on a sheet of ice?</p>
<p>In the meantime, he has his hands full with another pair of youngsters.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks, Vellucci’s daughter, Alli, graduated from college and his teenage son, Ryan, got drafted in the United States Hockey League.</p>
<p>When the AHL announced Monday that the season was canceled, the 53-year-old coach was in the middle of moving his daughter into a new apartment.</p>
<p>“Crazy week,” said Vellucci, his back aching and breath still coming back.</p>
