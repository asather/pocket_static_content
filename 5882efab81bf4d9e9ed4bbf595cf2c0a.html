<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Those in Pittsburgh should brace for the next couple of days to be wet as showers and thunderstorms are expected by nightfall Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service in Moon.</p>
<p>Some of those storms could be severe, meteorologist Lee Hendricks said Wednesday. There’s a 90 percent chance the city will experience heavy rainfall by Wednesday night, he said.</p>
<p>“With temperatures getting up into the mid 80s and and high humidity combined, a cold front could initiate thunderstorms in the area,” Mr. Hendricks said. “Earlier today, storms were moving fast across the Northeastern part of Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Other counties, including Jefferson, Clarion, Forest and Venango, saw thunderstorms pass through Wednesday morning, Mr. Hendricks said.&nbsp;</p>
