<h1>Mt. Lebanon invites input on schools' reopening plans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Mt. Lebanon School District is asking for input from parents and teachers on its plan for possibly reopening schools in August.</p>
<p>The plan was discussed at a July 15 virtual school board meeting that lasted nearly five hours and was viewed by more than 1,200 people.</p>
<p>Some teachers expressed concerns about resuming in-person instruction in the fall during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“I want to remind the community that this is a draft plan,” said school board President Sarah Olbrich, who said the plan is flexible, even if it is approved at the Wednesday meeting.</p>
<p>The detailed draft of the health and safety plan is available online at www.mtlsd.org, as are links to the survey for community input.</p>
<p>Ronald Davis, assistant superintendent for secondary education, said the plan is based on guidance from the Allegheny County Health Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state Department of Health and Department of Education.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis said the plan is an evolving one.</p>
<p>“The district will adjust it ... to make sure the return to the classroom — if that is the direction we are going with — on Aug. 24 is as safe as possible for employees and students alike,” he said.</p>
<p>For now, in the green phase, the district would be able to have in-person instruction. However, students will have the option to enroll in the district’s new cyber academy if the student’s family chooses.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon will require masks or face coverings to be worn by all students and staff at all times. There are exceptions to mask-wearing, such as when a student is eating lunch.</p>
<p>The district will supply masks to students or staff who do not have one.</p>
<p>Students and teachers will need to do a “self assessment” before each school day, including a temperature and symptom check.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis said the district has been stockpiling cleaning supplies, and high-touch surfaces will have to be cleaned at least daily. Hand sanitizer stations will also be installed throughout each building.</p>
<p>Additionally, the filters in the air filtration systems in all school buildings will be upgraded.</p>
<p>As far as the classrooms, desks will be spaced out, and the district has purchased “ultra boards,” which have clear shields in the front — so the student can see the teacher — and guards on both sides.</p>
<p>In the cafeteria, food will be more of a “grab-and-go” nature or plated meals — no more buffets. Additionally, there will be touchless points of sale and barriers installed to protect cafeteria workers.</p>
<p>Valerie Brown, president of the Mt. Lebanon Education Association, the union representing teachers, said so far this summer, she has fielded many questions and concerns from teachers who are “troubled about the new school year.”</p>
<p>“As we attempt to return to school in these changing times, the educators in Mt. Lebanon will continue to provide the best education possible for each and every student, but we can only provide the best education possible when the safety and well-being of each and every student and staff member is of the highest priority,” Ms. Brown said.</p>
<p>April McCracken, who teaches at the high school, said she realizes many of the students and teachers want to get back into the classroom, but she said, “for the health of myself and my family,” she wanted the return to school to be done virtually.</p>
<p>“I ask that the school board please permit the students and teachers to be completely virtual this fall,” she said. “Why on earth would we be playing with the lives of so many young people and all of us teachers by putting us back into a building at the high school that can have close to 2,000 people in it at one time? I don’t like those odds.”</p>
