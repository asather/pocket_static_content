<h1>Butterflies, boredom before Derek Shelton manages his first MLB game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ST. LOUIS — Derek Shelton walked into the visiting clubhouse at Busch Stadium on Friday afternoon and delivered a message to his players, motivating and directing them to accomplish a specific, important task.</p>
<p>“He walked in right as everyone was arriving and said, ‘Why isn’t there any music playing?’ ” Jacob Stallings said. “So I think he’s pretty relaxed.”</p>
<p>OK, so forget the rah-rah stuff because, as we’ve learned, that’s not exactly the new Pirates manager’s style.</p>
<p>The hours before Shelton would manage his first Major League Baseball game were actually pretty boring. He sat with bullpen coach Justin Meccage at breakfast, and the two discussed MLB’s expanded playoff structure.</p>
<p>There was also some last-minute video analysis and another chat with general manager Ben Cherington before Shelton spent some time talking to his wife and kids. He also thought about going for a walk.</p>
<p>“But it was really hot so I decided against that,” Shelton said. “I don’t really do a lot on the road anyway. Staying in my room is not that much of a change or challenge.”</p>
<p>Strike two.</p>
<p>While Shelton wasn’t noticeably nervous or jittery — he was actually extremely calm — the Pirates’ new manager said he did expect that to change once the game started — which, he would explain, is a great thing. For him and his players.</p>
<p>“Most guys are probably going to have butterflies every night when they go out,” Shelton said. “I think it’s natural to have ’em. I hope our guys have ’em because butterflies mean we’re anxious. We’re ready to get going.</p>
<p>“[Bryan] Reynolds probably doesn’t have any because he’s steady all the time and his pulse never goes back and forth.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Have fun’</strong></p>
<p>Another part of Shelton’s day involved FaceTiming with one of his best friends and longtime coworkers, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli.&nbsp;Twice, actually, in addition to somewhere around 10 text messages, Shelton said, as they’re both part of a group that also includes Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo and Kevin Cash, the current Rays skipper.</p>
<p>Baldelli’s big advice for his former bench coach?</p>
<p>“Have fun,” Shelton said. “It’s going to be the first game that he and I have not been together at, that we start, so I think it’s going to be a little different, a tad bit of a security blanket for both of us.</p>
<p>“I value his friendship, I value how he is as a person, so it was good to talk to him [Friday] morning.”</p>
<p><strong>Turn it over</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates’ lineup for Friday’s game was mostly predictable, with Kevin Newman leading off, Reynolds in the No. 2 spot, and Adam Frazier hitting third before Josh Bell.</p>
<p>One intriguing part was Jarrod Dyson in the No. 9 spot, but it’s not as weird as you might think for someone who has plenty of experience leading off.</p>
<p>Dyson has 966 career plate appearances in the leadoff spot, most of anywhere, but he has 819 in the No. 9 hole. Shelton likes what Dyson’s speed can bring as almost a second leadoff guy.</p>
<p>“It just kind of lengthens it out and gives us an option to do some things with the running game with him at the bottom,” Shelton said.</p>
<p><strong>Hooking horns</strong></p>
<p>Catching Joe Musgrove has become fairly routine for Jacob Stallings.</p>
<p>Calling pitches for the Pirates’ opening day starter, however, can sometimes be a challenge.</p>
<p>The first five are easy, but when Stallings gets to Musgrove’s sixth and — now new for 2020 — seventh pitches, he has to get a little creative.</p>
<p>“I use horns for a cutter,” Stallings explained. “I just wiggle the one [finger] for two-seamer. We just do those little variations, which actually presents problems for Joe when we’re trying to figure out pick-off signs because sometimes we use horns for the pick-off signs.”</p>
<p>And if Musgrove develops an eighth pitch?</p>
<p>“I’ll probably say, ‘Just throw it, and I’ll try to catch it,’ ” Stallings said.</p>
