<h1>Uber lays off 600 people in India due to COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Uber's l<a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/26/technology/uber-india-ola-grab-softbank/" target="_blank">ast big stand in Asia</a> just got a lot smaller.</p>
<p>The ride hailing company said on Tuesday that it is cutting 600 jobs in India, roughly 25% of its workforce in the country.</p>
<p>People working in driver and rider support, as well as other functions, will be affected.</p>
<p>Uber's president for India and South Asia, Pradeep Parameswaran, apologized to departing staff and called it a sad day for the company. He added that Uber will provide 10 weeks of pay and six months of medical insurance for affected staff.</p>
<p>The reductions are part of the latest round of job cuts that Uber <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/18/tech/uber-layoffs-pandemic/index.html" target="_blank">announced</a> last week. The company is shedding a total of 6,700 positions as it grapples with the pressure from the global pandemic on its core business.</p>
<p>In India, Uber resumed ride hailing services in about 50 cities earlier this month, but much of the country remains under lockdown.</p>
<p>India is a key market for Uber in Asia. The company had previously sold off the bulk of its ride-hailing business in Asia <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/08/01/technology/didi-uber-china-merger-didi-chuxing/" target="_blank">to Chinese rival DiDi</a> and <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/25/technology/uber-grab-deal-southeast-asia/index.html" target="_blank">Singapore's Grab</a>. It still operates in places such as Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Uber competes against Indian rival Ola, which <a href="https://mediablog.olacabs.com/2020/05/20/preparing-for-the-ola-of-the-future/" target="_blank">last week laid off 1,400 workers</a>, citing the pandemic's "unprecedented economic and social destruction."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Uber had touted its growing India business in a presentation to investors, saying it was the country's No. 1 ride hailing company with more than 50% market share. Both Uber and Ola are backed by tech giant SoftBank.</p>
