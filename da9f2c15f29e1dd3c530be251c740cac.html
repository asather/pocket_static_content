<h1>Penguins' Kris Letang and his son nominated for NHL Fan Choice award</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NHL season may still be paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Penguins fans can still engage in some light hockey-adjacent competition in which the Penguins are involved.</p>
<p>Monday marked the opening day of voting for the 2020 NHL Fan Choice awards. Hockey lovers have until June 1 to vote in their favorite categories representing the best of the shortened 2019-20 NHL season such as GIF of the Year, Best Feel-Good Moment and even Best Dog.</p>
<p>The Penguins don’t have many representatives among this year’s crop of nominees, with one notable exception: A video the Penguins’ social media team put together featuring defenseman Kris Letang and his objectively adorable son Alex was nominated for <a href="https://www.nhl.com/fans/nhl-fan-choice-awards" target="_blank">Top Team Video</a> along with entries from the Washington Capitals, Chicago Blackhawks and Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<p>Here’s the video in question, which mostly involved Alex Letang answering media questions during All-Star weekend in January.</p>
<p>In addition to Alex’s aggressively cute answers to questions like if he wants to follow his father’s career path — “Yeah! I’m already playing hockey, but I’m not in the NHL but I still play hockey” — the video also features a number of tweets declaring him the true winner of All-Star weekend 2020. As one person tweeted: “This is Alex Letang’s world &amp; we’re just living in it.”</p>
<p>For more Alex Letang content from that joint media session on Jan. 24, check out <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/01/24/Penguins-Kris-Letang-son-Alex-NHL-All-Star-Weekend/stories/202001240169" target="_blank">Matt Vensel’s coverage</a> of that memorable press conference.</p>
<p>Penguins fans may also be interested in casting votes for Iceburgh as the NHL’s Best Mascot or PPG Paints Arena for Best Building. They may also want to support two ex-Penguins — Colorado Avalanche defenseman Ian Cole and Las Vegas Golden Knights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury — for Best Beard and Save of the Year, respectively.</p>
