<h1>Trout anglers ponder whether to risk contact while fishing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tuesday morning’s surprise announcement that the statewide trout season had opened early was disappointing to anglers who had big plans for opening day. Tim Schaeffer, Fish and Boat executive director, said the decision was difficult to make but would eliminate opening-day crowds where COVID-19 could have been passed among anglers.</p>
<p>The executive order allowed properly licensed anglers and youth to immediately begin fishing for and harvesting trout. All regulations, sizes, and creel limits apply. Anglers are encouraged to restrict travel, avoid carpooling and stay a fishing rod’s length, about 6 feet, from each other.</p>
<p>The directive included cancellation of the statewide Mentored Youth Fishing Day scheduled for April 11.</p>
<p>“My grandson’s heart was broken when I told him that we weren’t going fishing,” said Cliff Dean of Tarentum.&nbsp;On Mentored Youth Day 2019, he helped his 9-year-old grandson, Alexzander Simoni of Vandergrift, to land two rainbow trout including a 20-incher at Deer Lakes Park. This year, he said, they’re skipping spring trout fishing altogether.</p>
<p>“There’s no way we could stay 6 feet from other people or each other at Deer Lakes,” said Mr. Dean. “It’s not worth it. If he got sick or one of my granddaughters got sick, I couldn’t live with it. This year, I told him we’ll just wait and see how this plays out. Maybe in the middle of the summer we can fish.”</p>
<p>Last year, Pat Bush of Edgewood took a 21-inch rainbow on a streamer at Lower Tunkhannock Creek in Monroe County,. This spring, he said he’ll do his fishing closer to home.</p>
<p>“In the near future I plan to take it easy and scratch my fishing itch at some small neighborhood ponds. They may not have any big browns swimming around, but they provide an escape from the house,” he said. “It’s great to get outdoors in times like this, but I think anglers need to think about staying on familiar water, or tying flies to fill empty boxes.”</p>
<p>Mike Parker, Fish and Boat spokesman, said accelerated trout stockings prioritized putting fish in heavily populated areas. He urged anglers who choose to fish to follow general COVID-prevention guidelines, visit waters close to home and observe the 6-foot “rule of rod.”</p>
<p><strong>Turkey time?</strong></p>
<p>No surprises were expected to disrupt dates for the junior hunter/mentored youth gobbler hunt April 25, and spring gobbler opener May 2. Game Commission spokesman Travis Lau said hunters are advised to practice social distancing.</p>
<p>“We have identified some impacts regarding mentored hunters, especially young ones, and junior hunters, especially if they are mentored by someone who is not a family member or who doesn’t live in the same household,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Trout photos</strong></p>
<p>Anglers who choose to fish can show off their catch in the annual Post-Gazette Trout Photo Contest. Send high-resolution images (1 MB minimum) to fishingreport@post-gazette.com. Include the photographer’s name and town, as well as the angler’s name, age (for minors), town, species, size, body of water and details of the catch. Deadline May 17. Winners in the Big Fish, Kidstuff and Artsy Shots categories will be interviewed for web and print publication May 24.</p>
