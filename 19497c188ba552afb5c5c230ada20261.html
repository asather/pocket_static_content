<p>“HIDDEN VALLEY ROAD: INSIDE THE MIND OF AN AMERICAN FAMILY”</p>

<p>About one in every one hundred people suffers from schizophrenia: more than 3 million Americans and 82 million individuals throughout the world. Schizophrenia patients occupy about a third of the beds in psychiatric hospitals in the United States. As many as 40 percent of adults with the disease are untreated each year. Five percent of schizophrenics commit suicide.</p>
<p>In “Hidden Valley Road: Inside the Mind of an American Family,” Robert Kolker, the author of “Lost Girls,” provides a tour de force account of this devastating and mysterious medical malady – and the efforts of geneticists and neurobiologists to find a cure for it.</p>
<p>Mr. Kolker takes us inside a family that seemed likely to take full advantage of post War II prosperity. An officer in the Navy, Don Galvin worked at the United States Air Force Academy, earned a Ph.D. in political science, became executive director of the Federation of Rocky Mountain States (an organization formed to attract industry, banking, transportation, and the arts to the region) and an expert falconer. Mimi Blayley Galvin, who Don met when he was 14, enjoyed regaling friends and neighbors with stories of her charmed New York childhood and her successful Houston relatives.</p>
<p>Mimi and Don got married in Tijuana in 1944, just before Don shipped out to the South Pacific on the USS Granville. But in deference to Don’s parents, Mimi, an Episcopalian, converted to Catholicism and the couple took their vows again at the Church of St. Gregory the Great in Bellerose, Queens. Between 1945 and 1965, Mimi gave birth to 12 children, 10 boys and two girls. Six of the boys would be diagnosed with schizophrenia. The most dreadful aspect of the disease, Mr. Kolker demonstrates, is “how baldly emotional it can be.” With symptoms “that muffle nothing and amplify everything” and behavior that is “deafening and overpowering for the subject,” schizophrenia “permanently tilts” the foundation of the family in his or her direction.</p>
<p>The horrors visited on the Galvin family are almost unfathomable. Donald, the oldest child, attempted suicide at age 12. He moved all the furniture out of the house on Hidden Valley Road and sat naked on an empty floor. Some years later he tried to kill his wife and himself. Jim, the second son, was a pedophile who victimized his little sisters. Brian, the fourth and most handsome boy who could listen to music on the radio and play it perfectly on the piano moments later, murdered the girlfriend with whom he had broken up, and then killed himself with a .22 rifle. Matthew, a gifted ceramist, believed he was Paul McCartney. Joseph, the most self-aware of the afflicted brothers, believed he had lived in China in a previous life. Peter, the manic family rebel, refused to get help, but ultimately was committed time and time again to the state hospital in Pueblo, Colorado. And a Catholic priest, we learn, abused several of the boys.</p>
<p>The remaining children tried to cope and wondered whether they would share their brothers’ fate. “For twenty years, I anesthetized myself,” said Richard, hoping that it wouldn’t happen to him. “I blocked my family out.” With financial assistance from a wealthy friend of Don Galvin, Margaret and Mary went to boarding schools, but like Richard, Michael, John and Mark, the trauma they had experienced had an enduring impact on their lives. Don and Mimi bore the unbearable by denying the reality was as bad as it seemed. Mimi, Mr. Kolker writes, became a hero and villain for her daughters, neglecting them because she was so attached to her sick boys, blaming mental illness on Don’s genes, but moving heaven and earth to keep the family together.</p>
<p>Alongside the family tragedy, Mr. Kolker reviews the age-old question: is schizophrenia “caused” by nature (heredity) or nurture (the environment). These days, he indicates, most researchers endorse epigenetics – “latent genes activated by environment triggers,” ranging from marijuana to bacteria to head injuries. A robust anti-medication has emerged. And there is a growing consensus that psychosis may exist on a spectrum – with aberrant behavior best addressed by discerning who needs medical treatment and who might benefit from watchful waiting.</p>
<p>Would the Galvins have fared better if they had been born 50 years later? Mr. Kolker, alas, is not all that certain.</p>
