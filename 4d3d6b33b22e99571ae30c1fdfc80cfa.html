<h1>Tyler Pasher's late strike seals Indy Eleven's 1-0 win over Riverhounds SC</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tyler Pasher hadn’t had a clear chance at goal all game. Before his last-minute effort, the best the Indy Eleven striker had managed was a weak dribbling shot straight to Riverhounds SC goalkeeper Tomas Gomez. But Pasher is the USL Championship’s leading scorer for a reason. When given an opportunity, the 26-year-old will snatch it more times than not.</p>
<p>Deep into second-half stoppage time, with the game edging toward a scoreless draw, Pasher dribbled through a slew of defenders before curling a shot into the upper-left corner for his fifth goal of the year, out of the reach of Gomez in net.</p>
<p>It was a moment of individual excellence — one that left most of Pittsburgh’s players in shock while Indy mobbed Pasher in celebration — and it sealed the Riverhounds’ first loss of the season, 1-0, in front of an empty Highmark Stadium.</p>
<p>“It feels like we let one get away,” coach Bob Lilley said. “But I’m not sure we played well enough in the second half to cement that three points.”</p>
<p>For the first time in 136 days due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Pittsburgh hosted a regular-season professional game. And for much of the second half, there was a lot to be desired from two of the top teams in the USL Championship, seemingly unable to create the fireworks they had in their first few matches of the season.</p>
<p>The Riverhounds (2-1-0) still sit atop Group F — one of eight geographically based groups teams have been sorted into for a shortened 16-game season. Indy (4-0-0), meanwhile, leads Group E and has had the best start of any USL Championship squad.</p>
<p>“If this is a measuring stick for us, it should push us forward, you know, rather than set us back,” Lilley said. “Mentally, it says, ‘OK, we have things to work on, but we can play with a very good team.’”</p>
<p>After withstanding early pressure from Indy to open the match, Pittsburgh came close to opening the scoring in the 11th minute when Jordan Dover lashed a low cross through the six-yard box that missed any oncoming attackers. Then, Ryan James hit side netting with a lunging attempt, and Skylar Thomas’ header went wide off a corner a few minutes later.</p>
<p>In the 27th minute, the Riverhounds nearly went ahead with two attempts in quick succession. First, Robbie Mertz knifed past a challenger, played a ball to Nick Forrest and received it right back on a give-and-go. But Mertz’s attempt met Eleven goalkeeper Evan Newton, and the shot-stopper parried it aside.</p>
<p>And one minute later, Thomas Vancaeyezeele flicked on a corner that rattled the underside of the bar before bouncing into Newton’s hands. Pittsburgh players appealed to the referee that the ball crossed the line, but the line judge deemed it hadn’t.</p>
<p>“I’m not the one to come here and bash the ref or anything,” midfielder Kenardo Forbes said. “But I think he got it wrong.”</p>
<p>The flurry of chances looked more like the performances that helped the Riverhounds start the season undefeated, with a 3-1 win over Louisville City FC on July 12 and a 6-0 demolition of Philadelphia Union II last weekend. This time, though, those chances didn’t find the back of the net, and it nearly cost Pittsburgh toward the end of the first half.</p>
<p>Indy earned a free kick on the left wing late in stoppage time, and Karl Ouimette broke toward the back post with a free run. But his open header went straight into Gomez’s arms. There weren’t many clear-cut opportunities for Indy otherwise.</p>
<p>Throughout the match, the Riverhounds paid special attention to Pasher. Wherever he went, so did Dani Rovira, the Pittsburgh midfielder assigned to man-marking duties. Pasher entered with a league-high four goals, and his late effort sealed the match in his squad’s favor. But before then, he didn’t get a shot off until a weak effort from outside the box in the 79th minute.</p>
<p>“Dani had a good performance,” Forbes said. “... I mean, what can you do? [Pasher’s] a good player.”</p>
<p>As the second half went on, the early bite in attack evaporated, with the game seemingly inching its way toward a scoreless draw.</p>
<p>But Pasher had the last word, sending his 90th-minute curling effort into the top corner, causing him and his teammates to erupt into celebration while the Riverhounds stomached their first defeat of the season.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure either team played the most elegant, attractive soccer,” Lilley said. “It came down to one moment. And to their credit, they got the goal.”</p>
