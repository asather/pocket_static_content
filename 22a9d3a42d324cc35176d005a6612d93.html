<p>Last week’s order by <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/13/Gov-Wolf-closes-all-K-12-schools-in-Pa-for-two-weeks/stories/202003130150" target="_blank">Gov. Tom Wolf closing all Pennsylvania K-12 schools</a> to help slow the spread of COVID-19 came with the notice that districts would not be penalized if they failed to meet the required amount of days or hours of instruction.</p>
<p>While that was a relief to some districts that did not have the capability to ensure all students would receive lessons outside of school, others had been preparing to implement flexible methods that could have counted as instructional days outside the classroom.</p>
<p>Some local districts have continued with their remote learning plans, but other schools that had the ability made it voluntary. That’s because some schools were still waiting for direction from the governor’s office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think the challenging part is that the governor’s direction has not been crystal clear,” Randal Lutz, superintendent of the Baldwin-Whitehall School District, said Monday in a phone interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf’s order left some school officials wondering if districts should try to make up the days that are missed or if the last day of school will be pushed back, Mr. Lutz said. Schools are required to have completed 180 days or 990 hours of instruction by June 30, but the final day for instruction is usually weeks earlier.</p>
<p>Allegheny County schools were planning to close on their own before the state stepped in and announced its shutdown order Friday afternoon. By that time, many&nbsp;schools had already told parents that they were making preparations for students to continue instruction outside of school. But when they got the relief from days/hours requirement, they decided to back off temporarily until they got further direction from the state.</p>
<p>The governor’s shutdown announcement also preempted the plans of districts outside Allegheny County.&nbsp;The Beaver Area School District in Beaver County said that it wanted to provide cyber education to students during the closure, but guidance from the state changed that plan.</p>
<p>Eric Levis, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Education, said districts that have been approved for flexible instruction days can use them, but they’re under no obligation to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Levis said the state has been providing daily guidance to schools.&nbsp;Much of the information passed to superintendents also is on the Department of Education website, he said.</p>
<p>The website includes a <a href="https://www.education.pa.gov/Schools/safeschools/emergencyplanning/COVID-19/Pages/AnswersToFAQs.aspx" target="_blank">frequently-asked-questions</a> page that says the department will&nbsp;provide a form that districts and schools can use to report any shortfall in instruction time.</p>
<p>Even with the relief from the state, some school districts were still trying to continue education for students. Avonworth and Elizabeth-Forward were among the school districts that decided to implement virtual learning days for students. The Carlynton School District asked parents to fill out a survey to determine their ability to utilize instructional materials with devices and services in their homes. In Beaver County, the Blackhawk School District decided to use flexible instruction days for students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many districts urged students to keep up educational activities, even if they were not required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donna Nugent, superintendent of the Big Beaver Falls Area School District, sent a letter to families that encouraged students to continue learning in some way, whether they read a book or use online resources.</p>
<p>For those who need or want to continue education at home, Pine-Richland School District administrators put tips on their website for how to establish some structure.</p>
<p>The district advises students to identify an area without distractions to be a study space; eliminate other distractions such as cell phones and television; develop a schedule to create a routine; make sure to take breaks and exercise; and stick to a normal sleep pattern.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 response poses challenges beyond instruction for school officials, who are scrambling to keep families informed and make sure students receive meals during the the unexpected shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Lutz called the months between the New Year and spring break the&nbsp;“second prime time” for student learning during the school year because it is a long, uninterrupted time of instruction. The first, he said, was the start of the school year until around Thanksgiving break.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this closure, students are missing out on this “prime time” of instruction, which Mr. Lutz believes could have a detrimental effect on their learning.</p>
<p>“There are going to be some long days,” Mr. Lutz said.&nbsp;“We’re only in day one and it feels like its been an eternity already.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding to the problem, he said, is that other places that serve educational purposes for students, such as libraries and museums, also are closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That’s the problem right now because all the standard places that students can learn [are closed],” he said.</p>
<p>The problem, Mr. Lutz said, does not have an easy solution when options are so limited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple things, such as board games and certain video games can be of some enrichment to a child, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those with internet access have more options.</p>
<p>Many schools offer supplemental materials online where students can find reading and math lessons even if they are not required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>StudioME, a media production studio in East Liberty, offered free&nbsp;live streaming options over the next month to educators who have to move classes online. Joe Leachko, one of the founders of the studio, said educators from any level who are interested in a session should contact the studio at studiomellc@gmail.com.</p>
<p>There are a number of websites that have information parents may find useful. Commonsensemedia.org provides reviews and advice on technology resources often used by children. Scholastic.com has parent and teacher resources.</p>
<p>For the most part, school officials appear to be leaving it up to families to decide what to do, at least in the early response to the pandemic shutdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The students and parents can decide what’s good for them and what they want to do,” said Cissy Bowman, a spokeswoman for the Mt. Lebanon School District.&nbsp;“It’s up to each individual family what they want to do.”</p>
