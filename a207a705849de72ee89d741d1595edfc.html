<h1>Port Authority limits workers, plans to take employees’ temperatures</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority has deep-cleaned its West Mifflin garage, put maintenance workers on a reduced schedule and will soon begin taking temperatures of employees when they show up for work after three employees tested positive for the COVID-19 virus in four days.</p>
<p>Authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said Tuesday the deep cleaning occurred after the first positive test and the others who tested positive already were not reporting to work because they had symptoms. An outside company on Saturday cleaned and sanitized not only the maintenance area but also the other facilities at the West Mifflin garage.</p>
<p>For the next two weeks, maintenance employees will work on reduced schedules and those who do work will have their schedules spread throughout the day so less are working at any one time.</p>

<p>Additionally, the agency will test the temperature of maintenance workers when they show up for work as soon as it can obtain touchless thermometers. The agency has set up tents at the garage and obtained personal protection equipment for volunteers who will take temperatures.</p>
<p>Those tests will last for two weeks after the most recent positive test.</p>
<p>The authority took the steps after consulting with the state and Allegheny County health departments.</p>
<p>“We’re taking it very seriously,” Mr. Brandolph said.&nbsp;“We think working in smaller groups will make a difference.”</p>
<p>Steve Palonis, president and business agent for Local 85 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, said he was&nbsp;“dumbfounded” at the cases in West Mifflin because Port Authority and the union have been working well together on safety practices. He called conflicting advisories from state and federal health officials on proper procedures&nbsp;“crazy” and said that makes it difficult for workers and employers to know how to proceed.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why there are so many cases out there,” he said.&nbsp;“I thought we were doing what we were supposed to do.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the agency has had few problems with riders not wearing mask. Bus and light rail operators are asking riders without masks to cover their face or not board, and authority police have not been called for uncooperative riders.</p>
<p>“We’re positive things are going very well so far, but it just started on Sunday,” Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>If operators don’t have their own face coverings, they can use cloth masks created by a half-dozen workers ordinarily involved in upholstery repair. Instead of using commercial sewing machines, which were too powerful for mask work, the agency bought two home sewing machines that workers have used to make about 700 masks so far.</p>
