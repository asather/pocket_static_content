<h1>Pa. officials will allow Pittsburgh region to relax coronavirus-related restrictions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Not included in Friday’s announcement is Beaver County, where a COVID-19 outbreak inside a long-term care facility has left at least 71 people dead. U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb (D., Allegheny) is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2020/05/07/Nursing-home-COVID-19-Brighton-Rehabilitation-Wellness-Center-Conor-Lamb-pittsburgh/stories/202005170005" target="_blank">calling</a> for a federal investigation.</p>
<p>In March, Wolf shuttered much of the state’s economy and began ordering residents to stay home in an effort to mitigate the coronavirus. This week, Wolf extended his stay-at-home and business closure orders until at least June 4 for the rest of the state.</p>
<p>Wolf said Friday the Department of Health is monitoring other counties that might move to the yellow phase soon, though the hard-hit southeast is likely to be one of the last regions allowed to do so. The governor has repeatedly said that counties could see aggressive restrictions implemented again should cases sharply spike.</p>
<p>"Residents should be mindful that ‘yellow’ still means caution. Every contact between two people is a new link in the chain of potential transmission,” Wolf said Friday. “If the new case count begins to climb in one area, restrictions will need to be imposed to prevent local medical facilities from becoming overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>HARRISBURG — State officials will allow 13 counties in the Pittsburgh region to ease coronavirus-related restrictions on businesses and residents next week, a coveted step toward reopening that took effect Friday in much of northwest and north-central Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf announced on Friday that Allegheny, Armstrong, Bedford, Blair, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Fulton, Greene, Indiana, Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland counties will be able to move into the “yellow phase” of his tiered reopening plan on May 15.</p>
<p>They will join two dozen counties that were previously given the go-ahead to loosen some restrictions.</p>
<p>“We are closely monitoring the 24 counties in the yellow phase and we will reimpose restrictions if danger arises,” Mr. Wolf said at a Friday news conference. “We’re also watching other counties and are moving them into the yellow phase as soon as we can.”</p>
<p><iframe title="More Counties Added to 'Yellow' Phase" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-UW424" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UW424/1/" scrolling="no" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>"I had a sense that we were moving in this direction," he said in an interview. "Even the governor said last week that if our numbers remained good we'd be moved from red to yellow."</p>
<p>He said he credits "the folks here in Southwestern PA who have really taken to the advice the state and the governor have given" on staying safe.</p>
<p>Though the county can't reopen for a week, Mr. Fitzgerald said that will be a week for eligible business "to prepare and also a week to remind people this isn't the end. There's still more to the process" before we ever get to green, including maintaining personal social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands and staying safe.</p>
<p>"The challenge is still there," he said.</p>
<p>To enter the yellow phase, counties have to meet benchmarks set by the state. That includes ramping up testing and contact tracing in order to identify and quarantine new cases before they become outbreaks. State officials also set a target for counties to see fewer than 50 new confirmed cases per 100,000 people in a two week period, though they’ve emphasized that’s just one measure they’re considering.</p>

<p>The administration is also using a <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200508-CMU-Risk-Based-Decision-Support-Tool-05-07-2020.pdf" target="_blank">tool</a> developed by Carnegie Mellon University to decide which regions can ease restrictions.</p>
<p>In the yellow phase, the stay-at-home order for residents is lifted, although they must still follow federal and state guidelines for social distancing and limit gatherings to fewer than 25 people.</p>
<p>Gyms, spas, hair and nail salons, casinos, and theaters must <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/452553495/UPDATED-9-00-AM-May-7-2020-Life-Sustaining-Business-FAQs" target="_blank">remain closed</a>, while restaurants can still only offer carry-out and delivery. Other businesses <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/460381371/05-07-20-SOH-Yellow-Phase-Order" target="_blank">can resume</a> in-person services, though companies that can telework must continue to do so.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto issued a statement after the announcement Friday:</p>
<p>“I want to thank Governor Wolf for recognizing all that the greater Pittsburgh community has done to mitigate the spread of this pandemic, and allowing us to take initial steps toward reopening our city and our economy. But we are far from beating this — Pittsburgh residents, workers and visitors need to keep focusing on social distancing, not leaving home if they are sick, wearing masks, washing hands and generally just being smart about fighting this still-spreading disease.</p>
<p>“We owe it to our city’s heroic medical personnel and first responders to keep being vigilant, and we must do much more to test the greater population and to contact trace anyone who has tested positive for the virus. I have offered the assistance of the City of Pittsburgh to help implement these needed testing and tracing measures.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the announcement that the state would not allow Beaver County to move to yellow, the Beaver County commissioners and the county's district attorney said Friday that they would act as if they were moving to yellow, and they would not enforce the red restrictions starting May 15.</p>
<p>"I think they're jeopardizing lives," Mr. Wolf said about the county officials' statements. "In our opinion, the time is not right. I think it's soon in Beaver County's case, but it's not right today to announce they're ready to reopen.</p>
<p>"If they go ahead and do that [and don't enforce the red restrictions] they're taking a chance with the lives of residents and citizens of Beaver County. I think I'd be a little careful in doing that," he said.</p>
<p>Beaver County officials are upset because without the massive outbreak at the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center nursing home, the county would have fewer cases, for example, than Butler County, which was moved to yellow.</p>
<p>Beaver County has had 479 total COVID-19-positive cases as of Friday, but 312 of those are residents of nursing homes, and another 23 are nursing home staff, with nearly all of them at Brighton. The county also has had 78 deaths, all but 7 of them at Brighton. That leaves just 144 positive cases and seven deaths outside of residents and staff at Brighton, compared to 169 non-nursing home resident or staff cases and four non-nursing home resident deaths in Butler County.</p>
<p>Beaver County Commissioner Jack Manning was still upset Friday night talking about the governor's decision not to include Butler in the move to yellow, even though he had learned about it a day earlier.</p>
<p>"The governor's aide told us that our numbers are starting to go down now and that is good. But I told him our numbers are going down because there's hardly anyone left [who has not tested positive at Brighton] to bring the numbers up in that facility," he said.</p>
<p>"It just doesn't make sense and I don't know what [Mr. Wolf] thinks he's going to achieve other than following some arbitrary algorithm marker by someone at CMU," he said of the Carnegie Mellon University computer model that the state is using to help it decide when counties can reopen. "As you can tell I'm still pretty upset."</p>
<p>He said he and the commission and the district attorney are unified in agreeing to start operating as if they are in the yellow on May 15, in defiance of the governor's order.</p>
<p>"Our position is that if you're one of those businesses [that could open in yellow] and you're following the CDC's guidelines about opening, we're not going to go after you," Mr. Manning said. "We're not going to encourage people to do that, but we're not going to stop them.</p>
<p>"We'll just have to see if that creates any kind of battle with Harrisburg," he said.</p>
<p>State Department of Health spokesman Nate Wardle said the state is aware of the significant number of Beaver County cases at nursing homes.</p>
<p>"We are looking at where cases are coming from, such as whether they are in congregate care settings, work facilities, etc.," he wrote in an emailed answer to questions after the press conference. "However, we also know that those employees, whether of nursing homes, long-term care facilities, workplaces, etc., must go back into the community. We cannot just remove the numbers from these settings from the county counts and act as if they do not exist.</p>
<p>"In addition, if we are having large outbreaks at facilities in a county, and the county were to move to yellow, it could increase the risk of exposure to the general population," he wrote.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardle gave a similar answer last week when Columbia County was not included among the north central region, but all the others there were.</p>
<p>"There are several large, ongoing outbreaks in Columbia County that are not under control," Mr. Wardle wrote last week. "These outbreaks are in the food packing industry and long-term care facilities. If social distancing efforts are relaxed now, it could be devastating to the rest of the county’s population."</p>
<p>Butler County commissioners welcomed Mr. Wolf’s announcement but urged caution.</p>
<p>“On behalf of our businesses, we’re happy many of them will be able to reopen and ask that they do so safely,” Commissioner Leslie Osche said in a statement. “But there are still those who cannot open yet and we will continue to push forward until everybody is open and the economy is restored.”</p>
<p>Commissioner Kim Geyer added that while she's "very pleased" to have businesses reopen, "We’re still going to have to balance safety as well as find a path forward that enables us all to live on a daily basis.”</p>
<p>Democratic state Rep. Pam Snyder, who represents Greene, Fayette and Washington counties, said in a statement “I’m pleased the governor listened to my concerns about not being included in last week’s announcement and took a close look at our region. With today’s announcement, this means that many businesses which were previously closed or whose operations were significantly limited will now be able to reopen, provided they follow the health and social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>“The last thing we want to do is to go back to red, so it’s vital that each one of us follows the necessary precautions to protect each other as we continue to move forward toward the green designation.”</p>
<p>Somerset County Commissioner Pamela Tokar-Ickes said “Somerset County’s residents are mindful of the precautions that must continue as we learn to live with the virus, but local businesses impacted by the shut-down are desperate to begin the county’s economic recovery. It will be a fine balance, but we are ready to move forward."</p>
<p>Some business owners have reopened without the state’s OK, while lawmakers from counties still under aggressive lockdown orders <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGrove/status/1258836303145295875" target="_blank">have</a> <a href="https://www.pasenategop.com/blog/lawmakers-demand-the-governor-re-evaluate-mifflin-juniata-counties-for-reopening/" target="_blank">argued</a> their areas have met enough benchmarks to move to the yellow phase.</p>
<p>“Every reasonable measure indicates that our region absolutely should be progressing toward reopening,” Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre, said in a statement regarding Juniata and Mifflin Counties. “Keeping our area closed just shows that Governor Wolf is ignoring the data and science and instead is allowing politics to guide his decisions.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf, a former business owner, said he understood the frustrations, but added the anger was misdirected.</p>
<p>“The frustration has to be directed at the real enemy here: the virus,” Mr. Wolf said. “It’s not the regulations. Anything we do to bring people together, whether it’s employees or customers, we’re making it easier for that virus to actually attack and infect people.”</p>
