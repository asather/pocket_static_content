<h1>Bill to reduce unused Pa. office space passes state Senate</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A bill aiming to reduce unused state office space as a way to curb costs has been passed by the Senate, according to Sen. David G. Argall, R-29, Rush Township, the bill’s prime sponsor.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 1241 would require executive, independent and state-affiliated agencies to report their space usage on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Over the past three decades, Pennsylvania has seen a 26% reduction in the number of state employees without any evidence of a corresponding reduction of office space, according to Mr. Argall.</p>
<p>“With the increased accountability that this bill brings, we expect to see a significant decrease in the amount of leased space by state government and millions of dollars of taxpayer savings per year,” Mr. Argall was quoted in a news release.</p>
