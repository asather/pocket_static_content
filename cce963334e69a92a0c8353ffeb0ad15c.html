<h1>Trinity Area School District, police investigating after security breaches during virtual classrooms</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Trinity Area School District is looking for answers after they reported there was a security breach in a fifth-grade cyberclassroom at Trinity West Elementary on Wednesday, according to <a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909642/2020/09/E6319BFA-1522-4DCB-83E0-E70B9FBC3FC8.jpeg" target="_blank">a letter by the district’s superintendent</a> that was obtained by Post-Gazette news partner KDKA-TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the letter, written by the district’s superintendent Michael P. Lucas, the&nbsp;“hacker” accessed the virtual classroom and was&nbsp;“able to introduce offensive racial and other inappropriate comments.” Mr. Lucas also told parents in the letter that there was a report of an alleged pornographic image as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Lucas was not able to be reached for comment Wednesday night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>KDKA-TV reports that Kodi Cimino witnessed what happened while her fifth-grader son was attending the class online Wednesday morning. Although Ms. Cimino was not able to be reached late Wednesday night, she wrote on her Facebook page that she was&nbsp;“livid” after seeing the offensive comments and pornographic images during the online classroom meeting.&nbsp;“I am shaking so bad,” Ms. Cimino wrote in her public post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the letter, Mr. Lucas told parents that police are actively conducting a criminal investigation and that Trinity Area will&nbsp;“prosecute those to be found to be responsible to the fullest extent of the law.” He also told parents that police and district staff members are tracking IP addresses to identify where the messages or images originated.</p>
<p>Mr. Lucas also told parents there were other security breaches in two virtual classrooms at the high school. Mr. Lucas told parents that the district has reached out to Zoom to understand how a breach can occur and how to prevent another in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Lucas also told parents they are postponing live instruction “until this issue is resolved.” On Thursday, teachers will begin posting assignments, recordings and activities in Canvas for students working remotely, Mr. Lucas said.</p>
<p>“We are disappointed, but we will not give up,” Mr. Lucas said in the letter.&nbsp;“Our teachers have worked too hard to let the criminal actions of one or two stop us from safely teaching students remotely.”&nbsp;</p>
