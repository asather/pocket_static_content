<h1>Penalty kill buoys the Penguins again in a 3-2 win over the Panthers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>SUNRISE, Fla. –&nbsp;One popular topic during this week-long road trip was the power play. And, yes, the Penguins finally lit the lamp on one of those Saturday.</p>
<p>But here just off the Atlantic coast at BB&amp;T Center, they were buoyed again by their other special-teams unit. They killed three more penalties in a 3-2 win over the Florida Panthers and were a perfect 10-for-10 on the three-game trip.</p>
<p>At a pivotal point with 3:51 left in the second period and the Penguins leading by a goal, the Panthers, the better team Saturday, got another power play.</p>
<p>“Obviously, we wanted to come in after the period with the lead,” said Teddy Blueger, first over the boards for that key kill. “That penalty kill could have swung the game either way. That was definitely a big moment in the game.”</p>
<p>Blueger and Kris Letang, who both got goals in the win, each got their body in front of a Panthers shot early in the power play. Their four killers then flustered Panthers All-Star forward Jonathan Huberdeau into coughing up the puck.</p>
<p>Brandon Tanev burst in alone on Sergei Bobrovsky and nearly made it 4-2. His shot rang off the left pipe and Blueger couldn’t hammer the rebound home.</p>
<p>“To have four guys outwork their five and generate offense,” Zach Aston-Reese said, “it takes the wind out of their sails and gives our guys a little extra juice.”</p>
<p>The Penguins kept the Panthers uncomfortable for the rest of Juuso Riikola’s minor penalty, allowing just one shot from 29 feet out that hardly threatened.</p>
<p>The Penguins went 2-1 on their three-game road trip that started with a win in Washington on Super Bowl Sunday. They lost in Tampa Bay on Thursday. All three teams entered Saturday ranked in the NHL’s top 12 on the power play.</p>
<p>The Penguins shut them all down. The only negative was losing John Marino to injury after he took a slap shot to the face during a Tampa Bay power play.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to give credit to Marino for eating one off the face,” Aston-Reese said of that unlucky shot block. “I feel pretty bad. I tipped that one into his face.”</p>
<p>Letang feels the Penguins “can be the best PK in the league” when they play like this, parking themselves in shooting lanes and pressuring puck-carriers when they get the opportunity. Sullivan praised his penalty killers for winning battles and making it difficult for their opponents to just get set up in the zone.</p>
<p>“We were very aggressive,” Jack Johnson said, “and we’ll try to keep that up.”</p>
<p>The Penguins have allowed just two power-play goals in the last eight games.</p>
<p>“Special teams is so important heading into the playoffs, if you can score on a power play or prevent one on the penalty kill,” Aston-Reese said. “Every team is going to be different and we just have to make subtle adjustments. The Xs and Os will only get you so far. It’s takes a lot of effort and courage to block shots.”</p>
<p>After their first kill Saturday, Letang stepped out of the box and watched as the puck fortunately skipped right to him at center ice. He busted out his signature shootout move, freezing Bobrovsky with a flick of the stick then pulling it to his backhand. Letang flipped the puck past the Panthers goalie to make it 1-0.</p>
<p>“I think it was karma,” the blue-liner said. “I didn’t think it was a penalty.”</p>
<p>Less than five minutes later, Blueger whacked a loose puck past Bobrovsky. The Panthers scored on a 4-on-2 rush late in the first to pull back within a goal.</p>
<p>Sidney Crosby scored on the power play, redirecting a Jared McCann shot past Bobrovsky, early in the second period to restore the two-goal lead. The Penguins had 11 power plays in their previous two games and didn’t score on any.</p>
<p>But the Panthers made it 3-2 just 1:09 later on another odd-man rush. This time it was Brett Connolly burying a pass from Pittsburgh native Vincent Trocheck.</p>
<p>The Penguins, compared to last season, had been much improved at preventing odd-man rushes before the All-Star break. But that has been a major problem in their four games since. Penguins defensemen have been caught flat-footed at the blue line and the forwards haven’t as often busted back to bail them out.</p>
<p>“We learned on this trip that we have to clean up this area,” Letang said.</p>
<p>There was inexplicably one more just before the final buzzer, with Bobrovsky on the bench to get the Panthers an extra attacker. Keith Yandle threaded a pass through five Penguins to Evgenii Dadonov, who fired wide of the left post.</p>
<p>“In the last eight seconds, we can’t give up a breakaway,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “We do a great job working hard down low. We get that clear. We just can’t allow people to get behind us and we have to have five guys inside the dots. We just have to have more awareness in that [6-on-5] circumstance.”</p>
<p>The Penguins avoided a season sweep by the Panthers. That last happened in the lost 2003-04 season that helped them land Crosby and Evgeni Malkin.</p>
<p>The Penguins will get a rematch with the Lightning back in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. That will be the first game of a four-game homestand at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
