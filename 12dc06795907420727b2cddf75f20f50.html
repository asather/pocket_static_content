<p>In a world where technology is sometimes the only thing keeping us connected, and entertainment goes a long way toward keeping us sane, Carnegie Mellon University used both to send off the graduating class of 2020 on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUZ6vCrMWwI&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">virtual conferral of degrees</a> came online at 10 a.m.. to bestow 5,400 bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees —&nbsp;the first time that CMU has conferred degrees on <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2020/may/class-2020-virtual-conferral.html" target="_blank">the entire cohort of graduates at the same time around the world</a>.</p>
<p>The video included cameo appearances by some of <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2020/may/class-2020-congratulations.html" target="_blank">CMU’s most high-profile, successful graduates.</a> It was a mostly lighthearted virtual event, despite the COVID-19 pandemic that forced the unprecedented ceremony, along with hundreds like it going on worldwide.</p>
<p>Gina Casalegno, vice president of Student Affairs, kicked off the commencement “preshow” at 9:30 a.m.by teasing, “Just like in every Marvel movie of your generation, be sure to stick around till the very end. You won’t be disappointed.”</p>
<p>That grand finale was left to Emmy-, Tony- and Grammy-winning Pittsburgher Billy Porter (Class of ‘91), who had this message for CMU’s graduates:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/npvInJ7Jpd4" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>“Y’all still here? What y’all doing? You just graduated; it's time to go celebrate. Better yet,” Mr. Porter said, “it’s time for you to take over the world. It’s your turn now. We need you.”</p>
<p>The parade of award-winning actors, CEO’s and innovators began with Ted&nbsp;Danson ('72), who was a commencement speaker when he received an honorary doctorate in 2018. He acknowledged his return to CMU in February of this year, when he spoke with members of the School of Drama.</p>
<p>He said it was clear to him that he was speaking not just with students but "with fellow artists."</p>
<p>"I hope we all get to work together someday," he said in the video from his home.</p>
<p>He finished with a message for 2020 graduates beyond the performers: "And to all the rest of you who may be biologists, engineers and scientists, please save us."</p>
<p>He might have added statistics to that list. Mayor Bill Peduto, in a Sunday appearance on CNN, cited real-time date developed by CMU as one of the factors in Pittsburgh’s reopening phases during the current pandemic.</p>
<p>Both student speakers for the class of 2020 are on paths to careers in data analysis.</p>
<p>Graduate speaker Shannon Gallagher, of Rockville, Md., was conferred her Ph.D in statistics. She spent her entire college career at CMU, beginning in 2010, and recently started a new job — in the Biostatistics Research Branch of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>"We're never going to forget this year, but we're going to get through it — because the future is Tartan," she said.</p>
<p>Ana Torubara of Jacksonville, Fla., was the student speaker representing undergraduates. She leaves with the hope of applying her analytical background to strategic project management and consulting.</p>
<p>"As frustrating and confusing as the present reality is," she said, "the only way to get through it is, to get through it. It means we have to focus on the positives in our lives, understand the things we can control and let go of the things that we can't."</p>
<p>The parade of alumni stretched across the U.S. and in all walks of business, government and the arts. Making video appearances to support the CMU Class of 2020 were:</p>
<p>Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico; Keith Block, former co-CEO of Salesforce; Tony- and Grammy-winning actor-singer Leslie Odom Jr.; Brian Olsavsky, senior VP and CFO of Amazon; Susie Lee, U.S. Rep.-Nevada 3rd District; Larry Jennings, senior managing partner of ValStone Partners, LLC; David Tepper, president and CEO of Appaloosa LP; Luis vpn Ahn, CEO and founder of Duolingo Inc.; actress Ming-Na Wen; and Matt Rogers, founder of Incite.org.</p>

<p>Ms. Wen, Class of ’86 and a Mt. Lebanon native, has had a long career in Hollywood, but brought up two of her successes to spur on the class of 2020.</p>
<p>"I would say to you, as the voice of ‘Mulan,’ be true to your heart, because if you do that, all your dreams will become reality. Take it from me, a Disney legend, and also someone who just did a 'Star Wars' project, 'The Mandolorian,' that was a big dream come true. Yours will come true, too."</p>
<p>School of Drama graduates are facing their dreams in a new way amid the constraints of social distancing due to COVID-19. Instead of heading to New York and Los Angeles for in-person showcases with industry professionals,&nbsp;the budding professionals have prepared a three-day&nbsp;e-Showcase —&nbsp;real-time webcast at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday is open to the public at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drama.cmu.edu/eshowcase/" target="_blank">www.drama.cmu.edu/eshowcase</a>.</p>
<p>Another CMU first in 2020 are <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2020/may/first-ai-degrees.html" target="_blank">the first two graduates in the new artificial intelligence program</a>, Shashank Ojha of Herndon, Va., and Alexander Litzenberger of Shohola, in northeastern Pa. Mr. Ojha has been hired as an engineer for Nuro, a robotics startup in Silicon Valley, co-founded by a CMU robotics alumnus, and Mr. Litzenberger is launching his own startup, Agot.ai, which applies AI to the restaurant industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Von Ahn, who founded the Pittsburgh-based mobile language app Duolingo, told the students that “the worst is over,” because they will never work as hard as the did at Carnegie Mellon, in preparation for the “amazing” things they can go on to accomplish.</p>
<p>“Please go out into the world and make it a better place,” he said. “You will invent the future, and it better be good.”</p>
<p>Tamara Tunie (‘81), a Pittsburgher who left&nbsp; home for Hollywood and Broadway and has recently returned to her roots, sang "Smile" as her graduation send-off to the graduates. The song by Charlie Chaplin, she noted,&nbsp;“has served me well over the years, because even in the darkest moments, there’s reason to smile.”</p>
