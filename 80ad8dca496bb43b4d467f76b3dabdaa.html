<h1>As COVID-19 spreads, NHL reportedly considers modifying media access</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman discussed the situation with NHL.com. I've updated. Here's the latest version below.</p>
<p>Amid growing concerns over COVID-19, the NHL is reportedly considering further precautionary steps to avoid spreading the virus to players and fans.</p>
<p>The league is considering a policy that would close the dressing room to the media, according to multiple reports, including from ESPN and The Athletic. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said the league is "considering every conceivable option" but it has not made any formal announcements.</p>
<p>"What we're trying to do is make sure that we're doing the prudent things," Bettman told NHL.com. "We're not looking to change our media policies on a long-term basis. This is in direct response to the coronavirus."</p>
<p>The Penguins opened their dressing room to reporters following Saturday’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/03/07/penguins-fall-to-Capitals/stories/202003070045" target="_blank">5-2 loss to the Capitals</a> at PPG Paints Arena and have not announced any changes for Sunday’s game against the Carolina Hurricanes. However, several teams around the league have already enacted their own policies.</p>
<p>The San Jose Sharks began conducting interviews in a press conference setting on Friday. The New York Islanders made select players available outside the locker room on Saturday. According to The Athletic, the Dallas Stars planned to conduct their interviews in a press conference room.</p>
<p>While no one will shed a tear over sports media access – nor should they – it is fair to wonder what next steps the NHL might take.</p>
<p>The NBA reportedly asked teams to make contingency plans if they have to play games in empty arenas with only essential staff present.</p>
<p>The NHL’s deputy commissioner Bill Daly told ESPN he has not ruled out options such as postponing or canceling games, or even playing games in empty arenas. But he said that’s “very unlikely.”</p>
<p>“Let's not get ahead of ourselves here, OK?” Bettman said. “We're staying on top of it and we're in constant communication with our clubs and the [NHL] Players' Association, and we're going to deal with this in as thorough, professional, on-top-of-it manner as possible. But let's everybody take a deep breath."</p>
<p>Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James told the Associated Press on Friday that he wouldn’t play in a game with no fans present.</p>
<p>“I ain’t playing if I ain’t got the fans in the crowd,” James said. “That’s who I play for. I play for my teammates, and I play for the fans. That’s what it’s all about.”</p>
<p>Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said it “absolutely” would be strange to play a game in an empty arena. But unlike James, he did not voice an opinion on the matter.</p>
<p>“We've discussed kind of the situation and, you know, been brought up to speed on what's going on,” Crosby said. “But I haven't given any thought to that. Couldn't give you an opinion either way."</p>
<p>Weeks ago, the hockey world began to feel the ripple effects of a serious situation in a rather trivial way – hockey sticks. Bauer and CCM, two of the top manufacturers, were forced to close production facilities in China, where the virus originated. This raised possible concerns about a stick shortage.</p>
<p>In the weeks since, the hockey world has been forced to address COVID-19 in many more tangible ways.</p>
<p>The 2020 International Ice Hockey Federation Women’s World Championship that was scheduled to begin March 31 in Canada has been canceled, at the recommendations of the IIHF and Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>The IIHF has also canceled six U-18 tournaments in Europe in March. It will wait until March 15 before addressing the World Championship, scheduled for May 8-24 in Switzerland. Switzerland's National League postponed its playoffs until at least March 15 after the Swiss government banned events with more than 1,000 spectators.</p>
<p>The NHL has urged players to limit contact with fans. The league suggested players avoid handshakes, close contact and autographs. The NHL also implemented a policy where league office employees are banned from traveling outside of the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>“We’ve been told limit our interaction with fans and stuff like that, which is really unfortunate,” Penguins defenseman Jack Johnson said. “That’s just kind of the world we live in right now. Everyone is going to do their best to not get it. I don’t know if there’s much we can do about it. But you might as well try your best.”</p>
<p>On Friday, Gov. Tom Wolf confirmed the first two cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, one in Delaware County and one in Wayne County. There are still no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Allegheny County, the county health department tweeted in a Saturday afternoon update.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Penguins issued the following statement.</p>
<p>“The team is following the recommendations of the CDC, UPMC and the NHL,” the Penguins statement read. “Our medical staff has been in communication for several weeks with UPMC Infectious Disease about safety and prevention. The safety and health of our players, employees and fans are our first priority.”</p>
<p>In other NHL cities where the virus has spread, teams have been forced to make decisions. The San Jose Sharks were advised by Santa Clara County public health officials to cancel their game on Thursday night game against the Minnesota Wild. But that game against the Minnesota Wild – and Saturday’s matchup against the Ottawa Senators – went on as scheduled.</p>
<p>“When we were out on the West coast, they told us to try to stay away from large crowds,” Penguins defenseman Marcus Pettersson said. “It’s all over the news. For sure, we talk about it. Coach addressed it. He told us to be aware.”</p>
