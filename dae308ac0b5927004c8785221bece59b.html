<h1>Doughboy vandalism likely a reference to Peru communists</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A fundraiser for the nearly century-old Doughboy statue and war memorial in Lawrenceville that was vandalized with red paint on Memorial Day had raised about $1,000 toward its $10,000 goal Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>City workers spent part of their holiday on Monday scrubbing and cleaning the statue, and a GoFundMe page was established to fund ongoing maintenance and future restoration needs of the statue at Penn Avenue and Butler Street, which has long been maintained by community volunteers.</p>
<p>A brass name plaque damaged by spray paint may have to be restored.</p>
<p>“This fundraiser is set up to make a positive out of a negative act,” said organizers with the Lawrenceville United group.</p>
<p>The statue was covered in red paint with a spray-painted message on the base of the memorial, reading “June 19, 1986, Glory to the day of heroism.” The message was accompanied by a number of hammer and sickle symbols.</p>
<p>Carlos Aguirre, professor of history at the University of Oregon, said the message likely relates to a group known as The Shining Path, or the Communist Party of Peru, operating throughout the 1980s.</p>
<p>“Whoever did this is a sympathizer of the Shining Path,” he said. “It’s clear.”</p>
<p>The Shining Path started an armed insurgency in May 1980 — 40 years ago this month.</p>
<p>On June 18, 1986, the Shining Path began to protest the Peruvian government’s use of torture on its members and their movement to different prisons, Mr. Aguirre said. Although the Peruvian government at first tried to negotiate with the Shining Path, the members refused, he said, and the government sent troops into the prisons the next day — bombing two facilities and executing inmates who were in the Shining Path.</p>
<p>About 240 inmates were killed in one of the world’s worst prison massacres, Mr. Aguirre said.</p>
<p>“That day immediately began to be called ‘The Day of Heroism.’”</p>
<p>Every year after, he continued, that day was commemorated as part of the movement.</p>
<p>“For the most part, it’s totally inactive now,” Mr. Aguirre said.</p>
<p>Still, he continued, there are sympathizers around the world and he’s seen graffiti marking the movement around the world in Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid and London.</p>
<p>The Doughboy statue was erected in 1921 to honor residents of Lawrenceville and Polish Hill who served in World War I. The names of World War II soldiers were added in 1947.</p>
<p>Mr. Aguirre speculated that the vandalism to the World War I monument could have been done to suggest that the soldiers from that war were not “real heroes,” and that the ones that ought to be remembered were those killed in the prison massacre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That also explains why they chose Memorial Day: They wanted to amplify their message at a time when U.S. military heroes are being honored,” he said.</p>
<p>Police continue to investigate who might be responsible for the graffiti and are reviewing “all available video footage” from the area. Police asked that anyone with information contact them at (412) 323-7800.</p>
<p>City public works employees quickly began working on cleanup at the statue.</p>
<p>"Workers from both the DPW graffiti team and City Planning's public art office were called in on the holiday,” said city spokesman Timothy McNulty. “The graffiti team has specialized equipment so they had to go to their division to pick it up before they could go to Lawrenceville.”</p>
<p>Two different kinds of paint were used, officials said. The red household paint came off fairly easily, while the spray paint on the bronze was more difficult to remove.</p>
