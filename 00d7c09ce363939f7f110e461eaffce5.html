<p>The Mt. Lebanon School District is fielding offers for a new field. </p>
<p>The board voted 7-0 Monday to authorizing the district administration to solicit bids for the renovations to the high school football stadium turf and the surrounding track. </p>
<p>Superintendent Timothy Steinhauer said the district has estimates for the project, which total “in the neighborhood of $895,000.”</p>
<p>That estimate includes demolition of the field and track, installation of a new field sub base, installation of a new synthetic turf field and installation of a new running track as well as a 5% contingency.</p>
<p>Mr. Steinhauer added the board won’t know the exact cost of the project until bids are received.</p>
<p>The current field is approximately 10 years old, which Mr. Steinhauer said at a previous meeting was about two years beyond its eight-year projected lifespan.</p>
<p>Representatives from landscape architecture firm J.T. Sauer and Associates, of Burgettstown, which has been working with the district on the preliminary stages of the project, stated at a previous meeting the field is monofilament turf made up of single strands of plastic fiber to look like grass. The monofilament turf has broken down over time, and there are some spots on the field where turf is missing.</p>
<p>The surrounding track would just need to have the rubber surface replaced, according to district.</p>
<p>If the board approves the project once bids are received, construction would commence in the spring after track season is finished.</p>
<p>In other business, Mr. Steinhauer announced “Lebo Parent University” will take place at 7 p.m. Jan. 27 at the high school.</p>
<p>The evening is geared toward parents and guardians of district students in any grade and will offer a menu of 40-minute classes on several topics relevant to students such as academics, social and emotional well-being, nutrition, safety and how to deal with childhood stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Parents/​guardians are asked to register in advance and can sign up for up to three classes online at www.mtlsd.org. The classes are free and will be presented by experts in their respective fields.</p>
