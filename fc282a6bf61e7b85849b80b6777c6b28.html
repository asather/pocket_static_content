<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cranberry Township EMS this week received the 2020 Pennsylvania Small EMS Agency of the Year title from the state Department of Health, Bureau of EMS and the Pennsylvania Emergency Health Services Council.</p>
<p>CTEMS earned the honor over more than 1,200 EMS agencies in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“This award is a direct reflection of our dedicated personnel who work tirelessly day in and day out to provide the best prehospital emergency medical care possible. It’s also a profound recognition of CTEMS’ commitment to helping keep our communities safe,” Chief Ted Fessides, executive director of CTEMS, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In 2019, CTEMS answered 4,012 calls for service in Cranberry, Seven Fields and New Sewickley.</p>
<p>The award also recognized what the organization does beyond answering calls.</p>
<p>In November 2019, during the annual Save-A-Life Saturday event, three cardiac arrest patients who were saved through the efforts of CTEMS had a chance to meet the responders who helped them.</p>
<p>More than 380 individuals were trained in certified and hands-only CPR, and 259 parents were assisted in installing child car seats. CTEMS performed 32 Safe Landings visits for new parents and attended 102 community events.</p>
<p>“CTEMS is an exemplary example that an EMS agency should be more than just taking people to the hospital,” said township manager Jerry Andree. “We are proud of their efforts and thankful for the excellent service they have provided to the township for more than 50 years.”</p>
