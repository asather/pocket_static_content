<h1>Why Pro Football Focus loves the Steelers' Tyson Alualu</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Now that the Super Bowl matchup between San Francisco and Kansas City has been set, it’s superlative season in the NFL, a chance to look back at the year that was before it all comes to an end at the big game in Miami.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, the Steelers have made a few notable appearances on some prominent lists. The most eye catching? Probably defensive tackle Tyson Alualu’s inclusion as the biggest surprise among interior linemen in <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-highest-graded-players-rookies-surprises-from-2019-nfl-season" target="_blank">Pro Football Focus’s recap</a> of its top grades across the league this season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scouting website that grades players on every snap they play in a given game gave Alualu an impressive overall mark of 80.1 out of 100, explaining:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Ten years into an NFL career feels like enough of a sample, but that wasn't the case this year with 2010 first-rounder Alualu. His previous career-high grade for a single season was 66.5, but he shattered his previous grades in both run defense (79.9) and pass-rushing (68.2) this season with the Steelers.</em></p>
<p>That breakout was valuable, too, as Alualu played a lot in place of the injured Stephon Tuitt, who was lost for the season with a torn pectoral muscle back in Week 6.</p>
<p>If he can replicate that performance in 2020, it could go a long way in helping the Steelers address the likely loss of defensive tackle Javon Hargrave in free agency. The latter’s strong 2019 should earn him a lucrative contract somewhere else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teammate T.J. Watt also appeared on the PFF list as the NFL’s top edge defender with a league-leading grade of 91.3. The site heaped praise on his ability to disrupt opposing offenses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Watt brothers have wreaked havoc on opposing quarterbacks for what feels like the better portion of the last decade because, well, they have. T.J. takes the mantle as the highest-graded edge defender this season just a year after his brother J.J. Watt made a triumphant return to the top of the charts in 2018. The younger Watt finished the season with 81 total pressures, including a whopping 37 combined sacks and hits, as well as 44 additional hurries. He also led all edge defenders with eight forced fumbles and six passes batted at the line of scrimmage.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere, the team’s midseason trade for safety Minkah Fitzpatrick drew mixed reviews from ESPN.&nbsp;The publication’s Bill Barnwell ranked the deal as the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28489971/ranking-nfl-trades-most-impacted-2019-season-30-deals-worst-best#fitzpatrick" target="_blank">fourth-best across the NFL</a> this season and gave it an impact grade of B-plus.</p>
<p>However, he argued that the Steelers’ defensive turnaround in 2019 would have happened without Fitzpatrick’s five interceptions, two forced fumbles and three recoveries. And he questioned the logic of making the deal in the wake of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s injury that ended up scuttling the season.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Fitzpatrick will be a core piece for the Steelers for years to come, but my concerns about the trade when it was initially made still stick. As good as Fitzpatrick was, the argument that the Steelers could still make the playoffs in 2019 after their 0-2 start because they had a quarterback to build around in Mason Rudolph was more hopeful than logical. While the Steelers had plenty of injuries around their quarterbacks, Rudolph was benched after subpar play for Devlin Hodges and suffered two of his own injuries. The Steelers will send the 18th pick to Miami in this trade, and that would have likely been their best shot at drafting the sort of quarterback they'll want to have on the roster when Ben Roethlisberger either declines or retires. If the Steelers had made the playoffs, I would have pushed this trade into the top three. As is, it falls just short.</em></p>
<p>Barnwell weighed in on the March trade that sent receiver Antonio Brown to the Oakland Raiders as well, giving it a “D” impact grade and listing receiver Diontae Johnson as its saving grace for the Steelers, who selected the rookie with one of the picks they acquired from Oakland in the swap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No less than Raiders general manager Mike Mayock lamented that deal over the weekend, too, telling the <a href="https://theathletic.com/1542737/2020/01/17/mike-mayock-blames-himself-for-the-antonio-brown-mess-and-the-raiders-gm-is-ready-to-keep-building/?source=shared-article" target="_blank">Athletic’s Vic Tafur</a>:</p>
<p><em>“I put that on me,” Mayock said in a phone interview Friday morning. “My anticipation was that he was coming off a situation in Pittsburgh where he wants to prove everybody wrong and he wants to ride into the Hall of Fame. That he was going to come in with Jon Gruden and Derek Carr and our offense and lead the way. … I really thought we were going to get the best out of Antonio Brown and we didn’t.</em></p>
<p><em>“We weren’t able to get anything out of him. So, at the end of the day, in hindsight, we lost a third-round pick and a fifth-round pick, and I can’t tell you how much pain that causes me.”</em></p>
