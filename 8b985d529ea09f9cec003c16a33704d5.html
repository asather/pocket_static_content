<h1>Public Theater's 2020-21 love fest includes Shakespeare, August Wilson and Agatha Christie</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Love is in the air, onstage and all around in the season just announced by Pittsburgh Public Theater, which leads off with a musical comedy and then goes full throttle into “Shakespeare in Love,” an Agatha Christie mystery and a return to August Wilson.</p>
<p>Artistic director Marya Sea Kaminski also will spread the love this season, inviting Pittsburgh actress royalty, Helena Ruoti, and director Justin Emeka to join the Public as associate artists. Ruoti will play Queen Elizabeth in “Shakespeare in Love,” adapted for the stage from the Oscar-winning film, while Ohioan Emeka, the director of “Sweat” and the current “American Son,” will helm “Two Trains Running,” representing the 1960s Hill District in Wilson’s American Century Cycle.</p>
<p>For the Public, which premiered Wilson’s “Jitney” and “King Hedley II” and has completed the Cycle, this marks a new era of Wilsonian production.&nbsp;Kaminski, who came to Pittsburgh in 2018 from Seattle —&nbsp;Wilson’s other home — has reached out to Constanza Romero Wilson, the writer’s widow and executor of his estate, and Pittsburgh stakeholders in the late playwright’s legacy. Also next season, for the first time, the August Wilson Monologue Competition will be held at the O’Reilly Theater, on the set of&nbsp;“Two Trains Running.”</p>
<p>Kaminski was stirred to give the season a “from the heart” theme, and says each work fits because, “I was thinking about the state of the world, and the plays I was drawn to are the ones about people who seemingly disagree, but come together in the end,” she said.</p>
<p>Taking the unusual step of starting with a musical, the classic “She Loves Me,” is part of a bigger strategic plan, “and one of the suggestions was to start with a bang, something effervescent that was going to grab people right from the top of the season.”</p>
<p>“Shakespeare in Love” is the main event as the company leans into the Bard next season. It will coincide with the Valentine’s Day collaboration between the Public and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, for Manfred Honeck conducting Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet.” Kaminski will stage scenes from Shakespeare’s work, with pros and students from Point Park’s Conservatory program, bridging the gap between the Public’s Cultural District home and the Pittsburgh Playhouse, on the other side of Downtown’s Fifth-Forbes corridor.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be like a festival, centered around the Bard,” Kaminski said. That includes the annual Shakespeare Monologue &amp; Scene Contest at the O’Reilly.</p>
<p>The season ends with William Luce’s “The Belle of Amherst,” a one-woman show about Emily Dickinson, and the modern corporate comedy “Yoga Play,” commissioned by City Theatre’s Marc Masterson back when he was at South Coast Rep.</p>
<p>First up, though, is a musical, Kaminski’s second since coming to Pittsburgh. This year’s “Little Shop of Horrors” was the company’s best-ever box office showing.</p>
<p>Kaminski shares that she was reading the lyrics from the “She Loves Me” song “Three Letters” that “stopped me in my tracks,” and asked to read them:&nbsp;<em>“With November just around the corner / I’ve a feeling you may also share / Do you feel an undertone of discord and a sense of tension in the air? / If it weren’t for your endearing letters / I’d be flying south with all the geese. / By the way, have you read ‘War and Peace?’”</em></p>
<p>“Who knows how we are all going to be feeling in the fall?” she said. “But my hope is that this will be just the right romantic antidote.”</p>
<p><strong>PITTSBURGH PUBLIC THEATER’S 2020-21 SEASON</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sept. 18-Oct. 18, 2020: “She Loves Me”</strong>&nbsp;— Book by Joe Masteroff, music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick. The musical that inspired “You’ve Got Mail,” itself inspired by “The Little Shop Around the Corner” (circa 1940), is about a man and a woman who clash at work but unwittingly make a connection through a lonelyhearts ad.&nbsp;With a score by “Fiddler on the Roof’s” Bock and Harnick and a book by “Cabaret’s” Masteroff, “She Loves Me” shone in an award-winning 2016 Broadway revival starring Laura Benanti.</p>
<p><strong>Oct. 29-Nov. 29, 2020: “Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express”</strong>&nbsp;— Adapted by Ken Ludwig. The mystery set in 1934 features Hercule Poirot, aboard the elite passenger train, where his crime-solving skills and belief in justice for all are put to the test by an eclectic group of suspects. “The grand production will be rendered in Art Deco scenic design, with costumes to the nines and a magnificent soundtrack.”</p>
<p><strong>Jan. 21-Feb. 21, 2021: “Shakespeare in Love”</strong>&nbsp;— Adapted for the stage by Lee Hall, with music by Paddy Cunneen. On the way to creating his great tragedy of star-crossed lovers, penniless playwright Will Shakespeare is tormented by writer’s block — until he meets the lovely and wealthy Viola, who longs to be an actor. Although she is promised to the stuffy Lord Wessex, Will and Viola embark on a passionate love affair.</p>
<p><strong>March 4-April 3, 2021: “Two Trains Running”</strong>&nbsp;— By August Wilson. The pitfalls of urban renewal in the Hill District are evident in 1969. It’s the height of the civil rights movement, and restaurant owner Memphis and his regulars try to keep a sense of order and dignity as they each take a leap of faith. The Public previously produced “Two Trains Running” in 1994.</p>
<p><strong>April 22 – May 23, 2021: “The Belle of Amherst”</strong>&nbsp;— By William Luce. The one-woman show is the Emily Dickinson we don’t know from her poems. We meet her in Amherst, Massachusetts, circa 1845, where the supposed recluse shares everyday gossip and recipes, her love of nature, and her burning need to translate feelings into poetry.</p>
<p><strong>June 3-July 3, 2021: “Yoga Play”</strong>&nbsp;— By Dipika Guha. In this corporate culture comedy, newly hired CEO Joan is about to launch a brand of women’s yoga pants when her company becomes embroiled in scandal. Joan concocts a wild plan to save the reputation of her company&nbsp;— and her own. The play premiered at South Coast Repertory in 2016, when City Theatre’s Marc Masterson was artistic director there.</p>
<p><strong>Special events:</strong>&nbsp;December 2020: “Yinzer Yuletide”&nbsp;— The return of the holiday variety show, along with the O’Reilly’s decorated windows, craft cocktails and more.&nbsp;Feb. 12-14, 2021: For Valentine’s Day, the Public and PSO collaborate on a concert with scenes at Heinz Hall.</p>
<p><em>Six-play packages ($181.50-$385.50), ppt.org or 412-316-1600. Single tickets go on sale in August.</em></p>
