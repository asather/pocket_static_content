<h1>Observations from Penguins scrimmage: Goalie battle continues, Patrick Marleau shows his value</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins threw on their game jerseys once again Monday for the second of four scheduled scrimmages.</p>
<p>Before you ask, no, Sidney Crosby did not participate. This was the second full-team event he's missed after leaving Saturday's scrimmage in the second period. The better news is the nine Penguins who missed last week as a precaution after a possible secondary exposure to COVID-19 have been cleared, but they skated on their own during the scrimmage.</p>
<p>The Black team (top-six forwards and goalie Matt Murray) technically tied the Gold (bottom-six and Tristan Jarry), 3-3. However, the final tally came during a power play segment.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts and observations from the scrimmage:</p>
<p><strong>1. Murray better, but not shutdown</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest questions entering Monday was, how would Murray respond after allowing seven goals during Saturday’s scrimmage?</p>
<p>On just the second shift, defenseman Kevin Czuczman rang a shot off the crossbar behind Murray that ricocheted wide. Not a great start. But for the most part, the Penguins’ two-time Stanley Cup-winning goalie settled in.</p>
<p>The lone goal he gave up during the first period came when Kris Letang’s pass through the neutral zone was picked off by Sam Lafferty, who is playing like someone who knows he's on the roster's fringe and trying to do something about it. Lafferty fed it to Patrick Marleau in the left circle, who beat Murray on the short side.</p>
<p>Of the three goals, Murray had the best chance to snuff out that first one. Both of the other two came in the second period. On a 2-on-1, Brandon Tanev found Teddy Blueger. Later, a bouncing puck landed on defenseman Chad Ruhwedel’s stick in the slot.</p>
<p>The goaltending results should be taken with a grain of salt — at least early in camp — given the unique nature of the position. Muscle memory and reaction time are two of the most critical pieces to a successful goaltender — and two of the things that are hardest to replicate during a four-month pause.</p>
<p>“The intrasquad games are so important for all the positions, but the goaltending position might be the most important,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said.</p>
<p>Monday wasn’t a Stanley Cup effort, but it was a step in the right direction for Murray.</p>
<p><strong>2. Jarry faces the firepower</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins have structured their scrimmages in a lopsided manner. The top-six forwards and top defensive pair are on one team. The bottom-six forwards are on the other.</p>
<p>Monday was Jarry’s turn to face the firepower.</p>
<p>Early on, Bryan Rust creatively split the defenders and ripped a Grade-A chance on net. Jason Zucker followed the rebound, but Jarry dove across his body and put his paddle down for one of his more athletic saves of the scrimmage.</p>
<p>The three goals Jarry allowed came during the three separate segments: first period, second period and power play. Jake Guentzel found Evan Rodrigues in the slot for a bang-bang, backhand goal. Then in the second period, Jack Johnson rifled the puck over Jarry’s glove hand. The final tally came when Marleau tipped in John Marino’s shot from the point during the final power play segment.</p>
<p>Of the two goalies, Jarry had more to gain on Monday. Considering he was the facing the vast majority of the scoring chances against the top two lines, a second straight shutout or something near it would have added even more intrigue to the goaltender battle.</p>
<p>As it stands, it’s hard to make any strong arguments for one goalie or the other based on Monday alone.</p>
<p><strong>3. Marleau could help make the third line an X-factor</strong></p>
<p>If three stars were given out for Monday’s scrimmage, Marleau would be a strong contender for the No. 1 star. He technically scored goals for both teams, a five-on-five goal for the Gold and later a power-play goal for the Black.</p>
<p>Marleau played a top-six role for the bulk of his career. But in Pittsburgh, he’s been skating on the third line centered by Jared McCann. When he’s ready, Hornqvist figures to play the right wing on that line. If the line clicks and Marleau scores like he did on Monday, it will give the Penguins some of the critical scoring depth they had during the recent back-to-back runs.</p>
<p><strong>4. Rodrigues shows his versatility, underscores forward depth</strong></p>
<p>With Crosby out, Rodrigues centered the top line. He skated between Guentzel and Conor Sheary and made the most of the opportunity by scoring the first goal of the scrimmage. Later, he had another shot from the slot thanks to Guentzel that Jarry steered wide.</p>
<p>While you shouldn’t expect to see Rodrigues on the top line when the puck drops for Game 1, Monday’s scrimmage did show part of why the Penguins acquired him from Buffalo on deadline day. His first four games in Pittsburgh, Rodrigues played all three forward spots.</p>
<p>If Patric Hornqvist is ready for the first game, Rodrigues will likely start the postseason in the press box. But, as Monday shows, he has the skillset to step into a number of different roles — something that's especially valuable from a 13th forward on the depth chart.</p>
<p><strong>5. Guentzel looks ready</strong></p>
<p>It’s been said before, but it’s worth repeating again. Guentzel has looked good during camp. After scoring two goals during Saturday’s scrimmage, Guentzel played the role of the facilitator on Monday. He set up Rodrigues for one goal and later fed a puck through the skates of Sheary.</p>
