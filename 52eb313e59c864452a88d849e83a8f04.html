<h1>PLCB to expand curbside pickup, online fulfillment to almost all stores next week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>To better slake Pennsylvanians’ pent-up thirst for wine and spirits, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board says it will have its employees working at nearly all of its&nbsp;600 stores and licensee service centers across the state by Monday.</p>
<p>Those 565 stores still won’t be open for customers yet, but they will be fulfilling more orders for curbside pickup and mail order as the agency works to better meet demand while also maintaining physical distancing and other COVID-19 safety measures for its employees and the public. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The expanded <a href="https://www.lcb.pa.gov/Consumers/Documents/Store_List_Phase_2.pdf" target="_blank">list of stores can be found on the PLCB website here</a>&nbsp;and includes 61 stores in Allegheny County. This week, employees were working at 176 stores, including 17 in Allegheny County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a Friday morning news release, PLCB Chairman Tim Holden said, “We’re making strides in expanding service.”</p>
<p>In its first four days, the curbside pickup program sold 38,145 orders totaling&nbsp;$3.64 million, and grew each day from nearly 6,000 orders Monday to 8,000 orders Tuesday, jumping to 11,300 orders Wednesday then to 12,800 orders Thursday.</p>
<p>Mr. Holden stressed that the system still has its limitations, but&nbsp;“after learning from our experiences this past week, we’ve made&nbsp;improvements to process orders faster, expand the hours we take orders by phone, and be&nbsp;more flexible in scheduling pickups, even the same day, if pickup appointments are available.”</p>
<p>He asked customers to continue to be patient&nbsp;“and we’re hopeful that the more e-commerce and curbside pickup orders we can process, over&nbsp;time, the better we’ll be able to serve more and more Pennsylvanians through this pandemic.”</p>
<p>The PLCB temporarily closed all of its stores and its online store after March 16 to reduce the risks and spread of COVID-19. It resumed some limited online sales at <a href="https://www.finewineandgoodspirits.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SpecialAccessLandingPageView?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10051" target="_blank">finewineandgoodspirits.com</a> on April 1 and gradually ramped up those. But customers were frustrated at the limited and randomized access to the site, which the state set up so the volume of orders wouldn’t overwhelm what it was able to fulfill from a new system using multiple sites. Previously, online sales were a very small percentage — less than 0.19% —&nbsp;of the PLCB’s annual sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, more employees started going back to work at the first 176 stores to fulfill more online orders as well as to accept and fulfill orders for pickup outside those stores.</p>
<p>But demand has still outpaced the state’s ability to take and deliver orders.</p>
<p>“We&nbsp;acknowledge that Pennsylvanians are frustrated with busy signals and want broader access to&nbsp;wine and spirits,” Mr. Holden said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;“phase two” list of stores expands the hours customers may order on a&nbsp;“first-call, first-served basis beginning at 9 a.m. each day and scheduling pickup appointments between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. those days, except in a few cases where stores are more limited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lcb.pa.gov/Consumers/Documents/Store_List_Phase_2.pdf" target="_blank">expanded list of operating stores</a> includes frequently asked questions and answers about curbside pickup.</p>
<p>The ordering limits remain the same for shipped and pickup orders: A customer may order up to six 750-milliliter bottles at a time and may place just one order per day. For pickup, customers telephone the store first and pay by credit card and are given a pickup time.&nbsp;Shipped orders incur a shipping charge, too, and need to be received at a home address by an adult age 21 or older. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The PLCB says it’s continuing to ramp up online capacity, too, with more than 100 locations packing orders. Though access to the online store still is randomized and limited, it’s improving: Sales from April 1 through 23 totaled&nbsp;74,624 orders for $7.11 million. For the entire 2018-19 fiscal year, for comparison, e-commerce sales&nbsp;totaled 39,000 orders for $5 million — out of $2.67 billion in total sales.</p>
<p>Stores remain closed to customers while state government monitors the COVID-19 situation. Closed, too, to customers coming are bars and restaurants, though some are selling food and drinks to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, the PLCB points out that other legal ways for Pennsylvanians to buy alcoholic beverages for off-premise consumption including from bars and restaurants that may sell wine and beer to-go; from beer distributors and supermarkets; from producers such as breweries, wineries and distilleries; and from entities licensed to ship and deliver to Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
