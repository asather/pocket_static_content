<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 06.17.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hello in here. Thank you all for joining my weekly Pirates chat. We'll get started at noon. In the meantime, feel free to leave your questions. About the Pirates, MLB, music, whatever. Let's have some fun.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmie</strong>: Since starting pitching seems to be the Pirates' greatest weakness, are there any starters on the market whom we might be able to trade for? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Alright, folks. Let's do this. Away we go. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: At this point, Jimmie, I wouldn't look for that to happen this season. One, I don't think it makes sense for them long-term to give up assets right now when there's so much unknown. Two, I think teams are going to be less inclined to trade starting pitchers right now. I think they're going to be less of a commodity. That said, if they could add depth at all, I would not complain.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen</strong>: Hey Jason. Do you know if the Pirates had any internal debate about drafting Gonzales over Hendrick? I like Gonzales, but Hendrick could develop into a nice lefty power bat who may haunt the Pirates with the short right field fence at PNC Park. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Stephen. Not to my knowledge, no. I think -- whether you agree or not -- they very clearly viewed Gonzales as a better player than Hendrick. Or at least maybe someone they feel would fit with them more, I should say. But if there was a direct debate over the two of them, I don't think it lasted terribly long. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: (Thanks for the questions thus far, folks. Good ones. Keep 'em coming.)</p>
<p><strong>RichE.</strong>: Does MLB's antitrust exemption have any impact on the current attempts at having a season this year? And in general, how does MLB function differently than NBA,NFL, NHL, because of that exemption? I know that if I was billionaire I couldn't create a professional team, put in it, say, Johnstown, and force MLB to let my team play in the league but I couldn't do that with the NBA, NFL, or NHL either. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: To the first part, Rich, I don't see how it would. Two, on how it works and the impacts contained therein, check out this from Baseball America; it's worth the time: <a href="https://www.baseballamerica.com/stories/why-baseballs-antitrust-exemption-isnt-a-strong-negotiating-tool-for-milb/" target="_blank">https://www.baseballamerica.com/stories/why-baseballs-antitrust-exempt...</a> <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: But to finish up, they could easily play a season here, and we could make zero mention of the antitrust exemption. The idea we're sorely lacking is compromise.</p>
<p><strong>Arriba21</strong>: Jason..were you surprised the Pirates didn’t draft a southpaw pitcher? Also, do you have any idea as to who the Pirates may be looking to trade for to start at catcher or backup Stallings? Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Arriba21. I'm not, honestly. I don't think they set out to draft all righties, mind you, although I do think they actively wanted to inject more pitching talent into the minor leagues (as they should). What they seemed to get were guys with tools or stuff, potential they can groom. I can't argue with that. The true test will be how they develop said talent.</p>
<p><strong>Manny</strong>: Hi Jason. I think it’s time for Commish Manfred to Manfred Mann up and come to an agreement with the players. If there is no season, do you see Manfred keeping his job? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I'm not sure right now, Manny. I've been a little Blinded By The Light. ... But no, seriously. I'm not a big Manfred fan. I think he's looked ridiculous during this time. However, we need to keep in mind that he works for the owners. It's not just him going rogue here, although I do think he could be handling this a heck of a lot better.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: How would you feel about the pirates possibly signing Yasiel Puig? I think he would be very productive for us this year plus Nutting could get him for a pretty cheap deal in a short season. Pirates also have a better chance to make the playoffs now with a shorter season which would increase even more with puig <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I would love it, Ricky. Tremendous idea. Again, I don't know why they haven't done it yet. Especially in a shortened season -- shoot, even if they don't play, put him in the front office or something -- Yasiel Puig is the answer for the Pirates.</p>
<p><strong>Bucsfan 7</strong>: Hey Jason, two questions, do you think there will be a 2020 season, and if there is a season, do you think Mitch Keller will have a breakout year? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Lemme take the second part of that first. If they have a season, yes, I think Mitch Keller is going to develop as one of the primary storylines -- in a good way. He was throwing well in spring and I think really starting to figure it out. I also like how this current group has handled Keller versus what the former one did with, say, Glasnow. They're encouraging Keller to be himself, not have him adhere to some sort of philosophy that has worked in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Is Polanco projected to be the starting right fielder? I haven’t heard any health/injury updates. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yes, Donna. If they play, Polanco will be their starting right fielder. He'll probably DH some, too.</p>
<p><strong>Tommac48</strong>: If the Pirates would put a competitive team together in the next couple of years and make the playoffs, what assurances would we Bucco fans have that the owner would pay to keep that team together and increase payroll? After all, ownership disbanded the team after the 13-15 run. That 15 team won 98 games and competed for the division. 2016 was the beginning of rebuilding, again! Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I truly believe Nutting recognizes they screwed up after the 2013-15 run. I think it's one of the reasons they've hired Cherington -- who is way into player development, finding players, etc. -- and you've heard so much about a "sustained model for winning." I'm going to link a story I did in January below. In it Nutting talks about adding to payroll and takes blame for that 2013-15 and beyond era. So, again, yeah, I do think if/when this current group turns it around, you will see Nutting increase payroll. I don't think Cherington or Williams take their jobs without that assurance.</p>
<p><strong>Jim M</strong>: Jason, It seems like the players are viewing the stand-off as a practice round before the CBA expires at the end of ‘21. That’s understandable but it seems unreasonable to not give even a small concession for the loss of revenue due to empty ballparks. The prorated salaries are based on the fewer games only. Am I correct? Don’t get me wrong. I think it’s understandable for the players to not trust what the owners say about losses on faith alone. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Jim, the players believe they've made their concession. In a given year, they're paid xxx for the year, not by game. Now, they're accepting payment by game. And I mostly see where they're coming from. I also think this is the unfortunate byproduct of years of acrimony between the two sides, resulting in neither side wanting to give an inch. So, the players realize they're probably going to get screwed anyway, why should they concede anything? They're also tired of getting jerked around, which you can see given they said they'd accept a shortened season and the owners are seemingly still playing around.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Do you think Nutting is one of the six owners against playing this season? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I do not think so. This actually just popped up on Twitter. I'll share a text I got a few minutes ago from a source: "Bob unequivocally wants to play baseball this year. Period."</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: I can only find one undrafted free agent signing for the Pirates, a pitcher from Sacramento State. Did they sign any others? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Not to my knowledge, no. And the guy you're referencing is Parker Brahms, another righty. Was on a tear as a senior -- 32 strikeouts and no walks, 1.14 ERA.</p>
<p><strong>Bucsfan 7</strong>: Hey Jason, do you think Mitch Keller will have a breakout year this season, if there is a season? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Got this one before, but the short answer is yes. I think Mitch will turn some heads ... if there's a season.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent</strong>: What’s your opening day lineup with a designated hitter? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: SS Newman // LF Reynolds // 2B Frazier // 1B Bell // RF Polanco // DH Moran // C Stallings // 3B Hayes.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: How do you think Adam Frazier does this year? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Very well. I thought he found a nice rhythm defensively. I like him in the No. 3 spot, at least for now or until someone else maybe finds their stroke. But I look for him to improve his offense a little more and play the same sort of steady defense. And I think the Pirates will probably flip him before 2021. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: To the question before that, I forgot poor Jarrod Dyson: I'd bat him seventh, after Moran.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: It seems the team seems to prioritize right-handed pitchers over southpaws. Is that true or is there just a dearth of left-handed prospects? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think it's more than latter. I don't think they have anything against lefties. I just think they're trying to get the best arm out there. And they should be.</p>
<p><strong>Itsyoboi</strong>: Will we have a trade deadline this year? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I'm more worried about having a season. A trade deadline, I would think, might be a bargained thing. Maybe the players don't want it? If this takes awhile, and it's only 48 games, that might be tough. But if they figure this out and can play 65-70, then I can see a trade deadline making sense.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: I mean, it's come pretty glaringly obvious the owners are at fault here, right? They seem to have no legal backing to their claim against prorated salaries, offering the same proposal multiple times, delaying negotiations, etc etc etc. Their effort to paint the players as the greedy millionaries finally seems to not being bought by the public at large, which is long overdue. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think they're both at fault, but yeah, I'd say it's probably more on the owners. They decide to OWN A TEAM. When the economy sucks, when everybody's struggling, yeah, you might lose money. You signed up for that. They've also made a ton of it recently, with franchise values skyrocketing. I'm OK expecting them to shoulder some of the downturn, if that makes sense. They've gotten plenty rich from this.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri</strong>: It’s June 17th and the Pirates are undefeated. Who would have thought it? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Serious question back, though, Yuri. Think about it like this: Is it exciting that the Pirates could potentially start the season in first place, in a race for the division? I don't know if my brain can overlook everything else going on and actually get excited about that.</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: It seems like the Bucs are stockpiling middle infielders, although some are still 3-4 plus years out, which of the current crop do you see potentially moving to another position? I know that Cruz staying at SS has been discussed but else could move? Tucker to CF maybe? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I definitely see Cruz moving. I thought that before the Gonzales pick. With Nick in the fold, yeah, I think I might try Tucker in center. Shoot, maybe even Newman, too. What could it hurt? He's versatile. I don't know enough Peguero. But I do think they're going to have to entertain the idea of someone moving.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: I saw they signed one but what else do you expect Cherington to do with UDFAs? More coming? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think so. I wouldn't be surprised if they added a couple more, especially a catcher or left-handed pitcher.</p>
<p><strong>Sunner in the sunshine</strong>: Hey Jason! Thanks for the chats! I would think the Pirates would lose less money per game if there were no fans than say the Yankees or the Sox because they sell out every game and the Pirates average 13k. I would think the Bucs will make more money with the TV deals and the additional money from more playoff teams so they should be in favor of getting the season going versus the Yankees that must pay Cole 40 mil. (prorated of course) <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Sunner, I think I see what you're getting at; however, I don't think it's a fair comparison. The Pirates are definitely not the Yankees in MLB's economic sense. They don't bring in as much and don't spend as much. Honestly, I don't understand how either would want to sit out. It's your job to play. If you can do it in a healthy way, you should be playing.</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: It sounds like the Bucs really valued positive Cape Cod success for 3 of their top choices. Do you think this is something the current front office will highly value on a go forward basis or was/is it just a function of not having spring results to look at? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think it's a couple things. I think it's a function fo guys going up there to prove themselves and doing it. I think it could be a function going forward of Cape Cod being available more than the college season and getting eyes on guys. But I also think, for this year anyway, that it was something of a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Hello Jason, where are you? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Typing at my computer. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>Butch</strong>: What do you believe are Pirates postseason chances in a shortened season? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I can't put a number on it, but I do think they go up. It's crazy to think about that, too.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: Where do you think some of the Pirates‘ draftees fall into the top 30 list? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I would think Gonzales cracks the top 10. Probably Mlodzinski and Jones in the top 15-20 range. I like Jared Jones a lot, and he will be in the top 10. But I think it's tough to do that right away with high school stats.</p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">thoughts on nick Gonzales? And do you think he’ll stick at SS?</span> <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Love it. Love the makeup. Love the stories I've been hearing about him. I think he's going to work, and I think fans are really going to like him. He seems like a genuine and terrific kid, honestly. I'm not sure yet. It's too soon. I haven't even seen him throw a ball with my own two eyes, so I don't feel comfortable saying he'll definitely move to second.</p>
<p><strong>Itsyoboi</strong>: does a deal need done by the end of this week? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think so, yes. And shoot, they need to talk before they can get anything done. I'm really, truly worried about the position baseball is in at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: I mean, if you don't mind me asking, what have the players done wrong? Uphold an agreement? Stand up against their employers who have mistreated them for too long? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They haven't done much wrong, James. I'm way more on the players' side than the owners. The only thing I think you can criticize them for has been an unwillingness to budge at all, believing this will dictate talks in 2021. I don't think it will. And I think they could move off of full pro-rata some. But I also haven't walked in their shoes, so I should probably keep my mouth shut. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. Looks like that will do it for this week. Thanks so much, as always, for participating. Until next time!</p>
