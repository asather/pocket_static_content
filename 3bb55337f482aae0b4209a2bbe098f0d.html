<h1>Pitt approves $1M base salary for new medical school dean plus bonus pay</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh’s new senior vice chancellor for health sciences and medical school dean will be paid up to $1.4 million annually, including a $1 million base salary and potential for yearly performance bonuses as large as $400,000.</p>
<p>The compensation committee of Pitt’s board of trustees met Tuesday morning via conference call to approve the total compensation for Anantha Shekhar, who begins his duties June 1. It did so after being told the pay was consistent with universities that have medical centers and are among the top in securing federal health research dollars.</p>
<p>In February, the full board voted to hire Dr. Shekhar away from Indiana University’s medical school, where he has held multiple leadership titles in clinical, academic and research areas. He succeeds Arthur Levine.</p>
<p>Dr. Shekhar will be eligible to receive an annual&nbsp;performance bonus, “with the minimum amount for satisfactory performance being&nbsp;$300,000, up to a maximum of 40% of his then-current salary,” according to the resolution approved by the committee.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Shekhar&nbsp;will receive five annual deferred retention incentive payments of $100,000&nbsp;“that&nbsp;will vest only if he does not voluntarily leave his University position, or is not&nbsp;dismissed from that position for cause, prior to May 31, 2025,” the resolution states.</p>
<p>Officials said the deferred payments are intended to promote continuity and progress by extending the tenure of an executive who will oversee research and academics of six schools within the health sciences, integrates their work with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and support Pitt’s continued pursuit of research funding.</p>
<p>He will be an officer of the university and oversee 6,000 faculty and staff in an area with 5,000 students.</p>
<p>Pitt Chancellor Patrick Gallagher said Dr. Shekhar plans to donate back to the university 10-percent of his base salary to deal with COVID-19 issues, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/04/24/University-of-Pittsburgh-Patrick-Gallagher-donation-pay-cut-pandemic-salary-higher-education/stories/202004240117" target="_blank">joining moves by other university leaders</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Gallagher, who recommended the compensation level, said Pitt routinely considers peer groups in setting pay, in this case the top funded universities with medical schools based on National Institutes of Health grants. It is amix of public and private institutions, since not all public campuses have medical schools, he said.</p>
<p>The median total compensation within that group is $1.65 million, and $1.1 million for base pay.</p>
<p>“You can see that (his) first year total compensation would be at $1.4 million, which is slightly below the median of the peer group,” Mr. Gallagher said. “We believe that this is consistent with pay philosophy of the university, offering a competitive but reasonable salary.”</p>
<p>Unlike Dr. Levine, 100 percent of Dr. Shekhar’s salary will be paid by Pitt rather than shared with UMPC.</p>
<p>In December, the compensation committee approved a base salary of&nbsp;&nbsp;$911,730 for Dr. Levine, according to the Pitt-published University Times. The panel that day approved $669,738 in base pay for Dr. Gallagher.</p>
<p>Overall, according to the University Times, head football coach Pat Narduzzi <a href="https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/narduzzi-again-pitt-s" target="_blank">has led earnings among Pitt employees. In 2017-18,</a> the most recent year based on state Right-to-Know disclosures, his base pay was $1.99 million and overall compensation totaled $3.21 million.</p>
<p>Dr. Shekhar’s titles at the IU medical school have included: executive associate dean for research affairs, distinguished professor, associate vice president for university clinical affairs and research, executive vice president of academic affairs for clinical research at IU Health, and founding director of the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, the sole statewide institute of its kind.</p>
