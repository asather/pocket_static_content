<h1>Port Authority to design its own face masks to be part of employee uniforms</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In advance of a protest scheduled at Port Authority headquarters Wednesday over banning employees from wearing face masks that say Black Lives Matter, the agency announced it is designing a mask that will become part of employees’ uniforms.</p>
<p>The issue has been at the forefront at the agency since July, when it changed its uniform policy to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/07/30/Port-Authority-Pittsburgh-Allegheny-black-lives-matter-face-masks-employee-ban-dress-code-social-justice/stories/202007300166" target="_blank">prohibit masks from having political or social slogans</a>. It originally tried to discipline <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/08/07/Port-Authority-Black-Lives-Matter-masks-Amalgamated-Transit-Union-uniform-policy/stories/202008070120" target="_blank">two driver-training supervisors</a> for violating the policy but dropped the issue because the policy didn’t apply to supervisors.</p>
<p>The agency later amended its uniform policy for supervisors.</p>
<p>A group that is expected to include Port Authority employees has scheduled a protest to denounce the policy at 4 p.m. Wednesday outside the authority’s headquarters on Sixth Avenue in Downtown Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday morning, authority CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman said the agency is allowed to support social causes — including Black Lives Matter —&nbsp;but it doesn’t allow individuals to use their uniforms for support because if it allowed one person to display a message under federal law it would have to allow all others. That situation&nbsp;“could disrupt Port Authority’s ability to deliver public transit service in a safe and efficient manner and cause harm to our employees, customers and communities,” she said.</p>
<p><em>Here's the full statement from Port Authority CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman:</em></p>
<p>“Port Authority's uniform policy isn't directed at Black Lives Matter or any other specific message, group or ideology,” she said. “The face coverings of our drivers should not be a barrier to using public transit, and our customers should not be made to feel uncomfortable or unsafe because the personal message on the face covering of our drivers is in conflict with their own beliefs or ideologies, particularly during a time of significant political and social polarization in our country.”</p>
<p>Sascha Craig Sr.,&nbsp;a veteran driver-training supervisor, was one of the supervisors originally cited last month for wearing and refusing to remove a Black Lives Matter mask. He said Wednesday he was cited again Aug. 12, but at a hearing six days later no action was taken.</p>
<p>Mr. Craig, who said he hasn’t been wearing the mask again on the advice of&nbsp;Amalgamated Transit Union attorneys, plans to attend Wednesday’s rally after his work shift ends. The agency is practicing a double standard by taking social stands as an agency but refusing to let individuals participate, he said.</p>
<p>Authority spokesman Adam Brandolph wouldn’t comment on specific cases, but he said two employees wearing Black Lives Matter masks were sent home pending discipline when they refused to remove the masks. Numerous others wearing masks supporting other causes such as Blue Lives Matter or President Trump removed those masks when they were asked by managers, he said, so there was no discipline.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said the fact the authority is allowed to make social statements is&nbsp;“legal nuance” that is difficult for the public to understand.</p>
<p>“It’s not a gray area, but it certainly is a nuance and it seems like a double standard, but it isn’t,” he said.&nbsp;“Port Authority as an agency we have our own ability to make statements, say Black Lives Matter, but certain speech by individuals can lead to a disruption in service.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asked why public disagreement with a social statement on the bus itself wouldn’t lead to the same problems, Mr. Brandolph said,&nbsp;“The difference is one is part of a statement by the agency and one is not. There’s more of a potential for disruption with an individual statement. Certain statements for [the agency] — they make sense.”&nbsp;</p>
