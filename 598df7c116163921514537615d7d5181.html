<h1>Faith over fear: Trust in those who remain committed to us</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Today is Easter Sunday, the most significant of holy days in the Christian religion, built around the belief in Christ’s resurrection — a belief that stands as the ultimate expression of faith.</p>
<p>It would be understandable to think that faith may be in short supply at the moment as the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed our ways of life over the last several weeks. Businesses are shuttered, people are ordered to stay at home, layoffs present financial anxiety for many families, nerves are frayed, patience is often wearing thin. There is fear of not only contracting the deadly virus, but of what life will be like once the pandemic subsides.</p>
<p>But rather than succumb to the dire realities of the moment, many are choosing to champion the notion of placing faith over fear. And we can see those wonderful expressions of faith in abundance.</p>
<p>The most obvious sign of faith comes from our religious leaders, men and women of all denominations, who continue to tend their flocks, even if it can’t be done in the usual places of worship. They have placed their congregants’ safety foremost, but have found creative ways to stay engaged. The Easter services today, and the Jewish celebration of Passover earlier in the week, may have been celebrated differently, but they were still celebrated.</p>
<p>There were livestream worship services, recorded sermons on church websites, even some “outdoor” services in which participants sat in their cars while a pastor led worship in a parking lot.</p>
<p>In this challenging time, our religious leaders offer words of encouragement, reminders that we are not forgotten, and assurance that faith will lead us through this terrible moment.</p>
<p>And we’ve seen faith extend beyond religion to the people who are truly risking everything for the greater good. Our medical professionals — doctors, nurses, technicians, paramedics — continue caring for the sick and dying, all the while knowing they place their own well-being at risk. Their dedication and service represent the very best of humanity, and we place our faith in them, knowing their efforts will lead us through this crisis.</p>
<p>We’ve also seen our communities come together like never before as we put our faith in one another. From the store clerks who keep the shelves stocked and the registers open, to the police, firefighters, utility crews and others who continue to provide public safety, we rely on them to do their jobs, even while most others shelter in safety with their families.</p>
<p>We have placed our faith in their dedication, knowing that their efforts provide us with comfort and safety.</p>
<p>Finally, we cannot overlook the need to have faith in ourselves as we continue to navigate uncharted waters. The late Helen Keller said, “Faith is the strength by which a shattered world shall emerge into the light.”</p>
<p>We are all desperate for that emerging light, and our actions now will determine what type of world awaits us. The outpouring of concern for one another that has become the dominant theme of this crisis has re-established a sense of community that seemed lost. Having faith in ourselves to continue to build on that community theme will get us through the difficult times still to come.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to fear what lies ahead, but we can overcome that fear with faith in those who have never wavered in their commitments to us and others.</p>
