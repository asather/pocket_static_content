<h1>'We'll search until we find him': Crews look for fallen hiker at McConnells Mill State Park</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Authorities on Monday morning continued their search for a man who fell into a creek Saturday at McConnells Mill State Park in Lawrence County.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Hamby, 38, of Meadville, fell into Slippery Rock Creek after 2 p.m. Saturday while hiking at the park, officials said. More than 85 people — representing 12 agencies and three water rescue teams — along with six dogs and a drone combed over more than four miles of the area over the weekend.</p>
<p>Park officials said witnesses saw Mr. Hamby fall into the water, and they used those accounts to assess the scene and determine potential entry points.</p>
<p>The search resumed around 8 a.m. Monday with fewer volunteers along shorelines of the creek, park manager Dustin Drew said. Park rangers and officials from the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources will continue the search during daylight hours throughout the week.&nbsp;Mr. Hamby was reported to have fallen between the Mill and Eckert bridges, officials said.</p>
<p>He had not been found as of 11 a.m. Monday.</p>
<p>“We resumed searching this morning along the shorelines of the creek and downstream of the point where he entered the water,” Mr. Drew said Monday morning. “We’ll search until we find him. We have very limited volunteers today, which is not uncommon through the week as they have to return to their work place.”</p>
<p>A Pennsylvania State Police helicopter was requested and used in the search over the weekend, but park officials said the chopper was not being used Monday. The creek Mr. Hamby fell into contains large boulders that make up creek beds and pools of water in between rapids, Mr. Drew said. The water ranges from very shallow to more than 10 feet deep, and around 30 to 50 feet wide from shoreline to shoreline, he added.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamby’s family is&nbsp;“holding up as well as they’re expected to,” Mr. Drew said.&nbsp;</p>
