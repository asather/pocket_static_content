<h1>Penguins loan Kasper Bjorkqvist to team in Finland</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penguins prospect Kasper Bjorkqvist has been loaned to KooKoo of Finland’s Liiga for the 2020-21 season.</p>
<p>Bjorkqvist, a 21-year-old, Finnish-born forward, was a second-round pick by the Penguins in the 2016 NHL draft. He played three seasons at Providence College before turning pro ahead of last season.</p>
<p>In his first professional season, the 6-foot-1, 198-pound forward suffered a knee injury that limited him to just six games and one goal.</p>
<p>Members of the Penguins organization have previously praised Bjorkqvist for his work ethic in the weight room and his strength for a young player. He’s an interesting prospect because of the physical dimension he brings to the ice.</p>
<p>Bjorkqvist’s move overseas continues what’s becoming a trend in the NHL. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the AHL canceled the remainder of the 2019-20 season and 2020 Calder Cup playoffs.</p>
<p>While the NHL and AHL are targeting a December return, there’s still a fair amount of uncertainty. An opportunity to shorten the layoff and get guaranteed playing time is especially valuable for young prospects.</p>
