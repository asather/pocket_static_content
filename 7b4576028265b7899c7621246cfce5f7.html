<h1>Liberty University welcomes students back to campus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Students returned to Liberty University after spring break this week, even as colleges and universities across the country have sent students home to try to slow the spread of covid-19.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Jerry Falwell Jr., the school’s president, said on Fox News that people were overreacting to the coronavirus pandemic and that the campus would open as usual this week. A few days later, after Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, banned gatherings of 100 people or more, Falwell reversed course and said most classes would be conducted online.</p>
<p>Northam has since limited public and private gatherings to 10 people. But the school pressed ahead with a decision to allow students to continue to live on campus if they choose, sparking outrage from students and faculty members who worry that the novel coronavirus could spread rapidly with so many people in such close quarters.</p>

<p>Concerned about Liberty University’s move, the governor directed his chief of staff to call Falwell on Tuesday, according to Northam spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky. She confirmed that the two spoke but did not indicate that the issue had been resolved.</p>
<p>“All Virginia colleges and universities have a responsibility to comply with public health directions and protect the safety of their students, faculty and larger communities,” Yarmosky said. “Liberty University is no exception.”</p>
<p>Some colleges with international students or homeless students don’t have the option of telling them to leave campus, the staffer said. But those student populations are relatively small, so social distancing can be maintained.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday, Falwell said Liberty is “abiding by the letter of the law.” He said he told the governor’s chief of staff that what Liberty was doing was no different from what other schools were doing.</p>
<p>“But we’re Liberty,” Falwell said, “so we get picked on.”</p>
<p>Falwell said the university is taking precautions in consultation with health experts, including switching to online instruction for most classes, cleaning surfaces hourly and serving meals as takeout only. Signs on chairs remind people not to sit too close together, he said, and students are using only every third computer in the computer center. The fitness center was limited to 10 people at a time, he said, but the school planned to close it Tuesday night.</p>
