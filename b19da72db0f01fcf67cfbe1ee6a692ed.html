<h1>AMC will showcase Greg Nicotero's 'Creepshow,' an homage to George Romero's cult classic film</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>AMC has announced it will air the first season of Greg Nicotero’s “Creepshow” reboot — a horror anthology series that’s an homage to the George A. Romero cult classic film that was filmed in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Beginning May 4, two episodes will be shown back-to-back at 9 p.m., with the series continuing on successive Mondays.</p>
<p>Creator Nicotero (executive producer and director, “The Walking Dead”), who grew up in the North Hills, called it a labor of love in honor of Romero’s 1982 film.</p>
<p>The six-episode, one-hour series ran on horror streaming service Shudder in late September. Each hour tells two lurid tales that are not for the squeamish.</p>
<p>Nicotero directs two episodes and worked on writing others. Oakland director and special make-up effects artist Tom Savini also directs an episode. Pittsburgh’s John Harrison, who collaborated with Romero on numerous projects, directs four episodes,&nbsp;including a particularly gruesome take on the old monkey’s paw fable.</p>
<p>Rick Catizone, also of Pittsburgh, creates 2D animations that reflect those he did almost 40 years ago for the film. Key special effects wizards include Gino Crognale of Mars.</p>
<p>Stephen King wrote the original&nbsp;“Creepshow” movie. His son, Joe Hill, was just a kid when he did a cameo in 1982. Now a successful author in his own right, Hill’s short story&nbsp;“By the Silver Water of Lake of Lake Champlain” has been adapted for a May 18 episode directed by Savini.</p>
<p>The second season of the new&nbsp;“Creepshow” was in pre-production when everything was shut down last month. But Nicotero recently shared an Instagram video of a big scary spider animatron.</p>
