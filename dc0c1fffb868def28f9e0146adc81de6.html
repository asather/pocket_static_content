<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers right tackle Matt Feiler is one of the NFLâ€™s top earners in performance-based pay after starting 16 games last season.</p>
<p>Players that enter the league as undrafted free agents or low-round draft picks are awarded with extra pay based on their playing time and salary from the previous season. Feiler, who entered the league as an undrafted free agent in 2014, earned an extra $387,578 on top of the $645,000 the Steelers paid him.</p>
<p>Feiler took over as the starting right tackle during the 2018 season when Marcus Gilbert missed 10 games due to an injury and a suspension. The Steelers released Gilbert following the conclusion of the 2018 season and named Feiler their starter at right tackle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feiler is the only Steelers player among the top 25 earners in performance-based pay. Chiefs corner Charvarius Ward led the way with $428,335.</p>
