<h1>Airport van service SuperShuttle shutting down</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>SuperShuttle — the shared-van service that has for decades carried passengers to and from airports nationwide and beyond — will cease operations at Pittsburgh International Airport next month.</p>
<p>Created in 1983 to serve Los Angeles International Airport, SuperShuttle has been facing increased competition from ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft. The company had already pulled out of many locations in recent weeks, including at LAX on Dec. 31.</p>
<p>According to the company’s reservations line Monday, SuperShuttle currently serves just a handful of airports besides Pittsburgh: Las Vegas; Austin, Texas; Miami; New Orleans; Cleveland; West Palm Beach, Fla; and Kansas City, Mo. The company also continues to operate in Hawaii and Cancun, Mexico.</p>
<p>SuperShuttle’s last day of operations in Pittsburgh and its remaining markets will be Feb. 12, according to two reservations agents reached by telephone.</p>
<p>SuperShuttle executives could not be reached.</p>
<p>According to a story in the Los Angeles Times last month, a letter sent to a Los Angeles-area franchisee cited “a variety of factors” for its demise, “including increasing costs and changes in the competitive and regulatory landscape [that] have called into question the economic and operational viability of the company’s operations.”</p>
