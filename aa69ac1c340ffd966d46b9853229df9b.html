<h1>Pittsburgh Zoo sought to import 28 African elephants</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium last year spearheaded an effort to capture and export to the U.S. as many as 28 live, wild, juvenile African elephants from Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>According to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service application documents,13 of the elephants, two males and 11 females, were ticketed for the Pittsburgh Zoo’s 724-acre International Conservation Center in Somerset County. Three females each would go to the Kansas City, Maryland and Memphis zoos. Another 6 elephants were slated for the Elephant Conservation Center in Natural Bridge, Va.</p>
<p>The application was submitted to USFWS on Mar. 21 by Barbara Baker, the Pittsburgh Zoo’s president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>If the application had been approved by the USFWS it would have been the first ever export of elephants from Zimbabwe, and the biggest number of African elephants brought to America since 2016 when 17 elephants arrived from what was then Swaziland, now the tiny kingdom of Eswatini.</p>
<p>But just three months later, in June, the Conservation Center decided against importing elephants and quit the effort. Kansas City, Memphis and Maryland dropped out in August.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Zoo withdrew its application by the end of 2019, some three months after the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora — CITES for short — adopted a new policy tightening export restrictions for elephants in Zimbabwe and Botswana. It states the animals should not be sent to zoos and must stay in their natural ranges in Africa.</p>
<p>The Fish and Wildlife documents, released in response to a freedom of information act request by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, detail how the Pittsburgh Zoo would pay a third party provider, Conservation Logistics LLC, to capture the elephants.</p>
<p>According to PETA, snipers in helicopters shoot the juvenile elephants with tranquilizers or sedatives, then use the helicopters to chase off the adult animals. It’s a process the animal advocacy organization said is “traumatic” for the young elephants.</p>
<p>PETA said it has sent a letter urging the Pittsburgh Zoo’s board of directors to adopt policies opposing wild elephant capture, end elephant breeding and phasing out the zoo’s elephant program.</p>
<p>PETA has also submitted a letter to the Fish and Wildlife Service saying the zoo should never be granted a permit to import wild baby elephants because it was cited in for being understaffed and unprepared for the birth in 2017 of an elephant calf that died three months later.</p>
<p>"Anyone who cares about animals will be appalled by the Pittsburgh Zoo's secret bid to tear young elephants away from their loving families," said Rachel Mathews, PETA Foundation deputy director of captive animal law enforcement. "PETA is calling on the zoo to phase out its failing elephant program before another generation of elephants is sentenced to short, miserable lives."</p>
<p>In response to a request for comment and an interview with Dr. Baker, the Pittsburgh Zoo issued a one sentence statement saying, “The Zoo did not and does not have a permit to import elephants."</p>
<p>According to the USFWS, the removal of live elephants from Zimbabwe requires an export permit from CITES, which sets international rules for trade of plants and animals.</p>
<p>Elephants are among the most popular attractions at zoos, but there is a growing body of research saying the charismatic megafauna isn’t well suited for a captive life.</p>
