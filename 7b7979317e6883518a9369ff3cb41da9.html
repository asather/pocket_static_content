<h1>Region’s legislators pressure state health department to share more COVID-19 data</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Legislators from southwestern Pennsylvania are pushing the state Department of Health to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/04/03/covid-19-data-disparity-pennsylvania-health-department-allegheny-washington-westmoreland-beaver-butler-county/stories/202004030160" target="_blank">provide more detailed demographic data about the spread of COVID-19</a>, primarily to aid first responders’ decisions about how to allocate precious stocks of personal protective equipment..</p>
<p>After fielding complaints about the dearth of data it’s been releasing, the department Monday appeared to be poised to respond to the pressure.</p>
<p>“As Secretary of Health, Dr. [Rachel] Levine has said, we have heard the requests from county and local officials in regards to their desire to have more information regarding cases in their area,” Nate Wardle, a health department spokesman, said Monday.&nbsp;“The department is actively involved in discussions on this and is working to balance the need for information with protecting the right to privacy. We are working to balance all of these needs this week.”</p>
<p>But whether that response will please everyone is another matter,</p>
<p>State Sen. Kim Ward, R-Hempfield, said she has introduced a bill to allow more COVID-19 information to flow from the health department to elected county officials and their emergency operations chiefs.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“It’s an issue all over the state. If we can get the governor on board, we can get it done quickly,” Ms. Ward said.</p>
<p>But she is concerned that Pennsylvania’s Democratic governor will back his health department, which has been reluctant to provide more information to most counties about the number of cases in their municipalities.</p>
<p>“It It just doesn’t make any sense. Give them the information so they can use the resources efficiently to protect our first responders,” Ms. Ward said. “I’m shocked that they would think this is impinging on anyone’s privacy.”</p>
<p>Only six counties and four municipalities in the state have access to detailed data about infectious diseases by benefit of having their own health departments. In southwestern Pennsylvania, Allegheny County is the only one with a health department, and it publishes daily tallies of positive cases and deaths, a gender and age breakdown and a map showing how many cases are in each municipality.</p>
<p>Both Beaver and Washington counties have sent letters to the health department imploring the agency to be more forthcoming with information about the infectious and highly contagious disease that, as of Monday, had resulted in nearly 13,000 reported cases and 162 deaths statewide. And Westmoreland County expressed displeasure with being blindsided about a COVID-19 outbreak at a Ligonier nursing home.</p>
<p>“We are concerned about the lack of information we are receiving from the Pennsylvania Department of Health regarding cases testing positive for COVID-19 in our county,” read the letter from Eric Brewer, director of emergency services for Beaver County.&nbsp;“It would benefit the responders to know the location of all positive cases. ... We understand that the disease could be anywhere, but if an agency knows specifically that someone at a certain address has tested positive, that information will help the responder make a more informed decision.”</p>
<p>Ms. Ward, a former respiratory therapist, said she was spurred to introduce her bill by the Ligonier situation and Westmoreland County Department of Public Safety Director Roland&nbsp;“Bud” Mertz.</p>
<p>Rep. Joshua D. Kail, R-Monaca, who represents parts of Beaver and Washington counties, said Monday that he intended to take up the issue in with his colleagues.</p>
<p>“Today we’re back in Harrisburg. I spoke with my individuals from law enforcement late last week. That’s one of the items I would like to address with the Department of Health,” Mr. Kail said.&nbsp;“I would like to bring this to their attention. I’m going to talk to some other lawmakers.”</p>
<p>Sen. Camera Bartolotta, R-Monongahela, said she supported at least public safety officials for counties and municipalities receiving more detailed COVID-19 data from the health department. They, in turn, could decide how much information to disseminate to the general public.</p>
<p>:”I do think that it would be very helpful if we got more information from the Department of Health, at least to our legislators and our commissioners and those that are in charge of public safety in these counties,” Ms. Bartolotta said.</p>
<p>“The last thing that someone in charge of public safety wants to do is turn on the news and hear there are X number of new cases in your county. You need to be able to prepare for things and answer questions.”</p>
<p>Ms. Bartolotta said she was reluctant to provide wholesale data to the public about which municipalities have positive coronavirus cases. She said people might be lulled into a false sense of security if they see their locale has no cases at a given point in time. She also said she worried what people with bad intentions might do with raw information, such as trying to burn down hospitals caring for COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>The health department says a 1955 law, the Disease Prevention and Control Act, limits its ability to provide information about 70-odd infectious disease to any agency other than other health departments. Mr. Kain, Ms. Bartolotta and Ms. Ward all suggested that it might be time to revise the law, which was upheld in a 1991 state Supreme Court decision that dealt with gonorrhea.</p>
<p>“That is something that needs to be addressed for sure,” Ms. Bartolotta said, though she added that changing the law would likely have to wait until the immediate crisis passes.</p>
<p>Making a few simple tweaks, such as broadening the range of officials who could be granted access to infectious disease data, might solve the problem, she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewer took aim at the 1955 law in his letter to Dr. Levine and Gov. Tom Wolf.</p>
<p>“We are adjacent to Allegheny County, which is able to tell their responders the specific case information. Political boundaries should not mean there should be different information available, especially when the information is known to someone,” Mr. Brewer wrote.&nbsp;“We believe it is time for the Pennsylvania Department of Health to not operate from a 65-year-old law and support all of the first responders of the commonwealth.”</p>
<p>For the governor’s part, his administration&nbsp;“doesn’t feel a legislative change is warranted at this point,” according to Wolf spokesperson&nbsp;Lyndsay Kensinger.</p>
<p>Ms. Ward’s bill would direct the health department to release to&nbsp;“the governing body of a county and the county emergency management coordinator the municipality in which there has been a confirmed case of a communicable or reportable disease within the past 24 hours.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s time to update,” Ms. Ward said.&nbsp;“What we’d be looking for are hot spots..This whole thing is so the counties can know where the resources need to be allocated.”</p>
