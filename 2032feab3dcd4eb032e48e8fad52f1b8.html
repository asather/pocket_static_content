<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 06.04.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Ok sorry about delay let’s go</p>
<p><strong>J-town Johnny</strong>: Paul, do you think Brees was wrong with his comment about kneeling during the national anthem? I realize this is a very touchy subject but being a veteran it turned me personally against football for 2 years. My belief was not against the kneeling or the cause it was the platform that it was done on. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No, I think he gave his opinion on standing up for the flag. He didn’t say he didn’t support the cause. Just that he thinks you should stand for the anthem. The fact he was shamed into apologizing is absurd</p>
<p><strong>Richy</strong>: in your opinion which sport will suffer the most from not having fans at games. From a performance and financial impact. Thanks, <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The NHL no doubt. The others have better TV deals</p>
<p><strong>J-town Johnny</strong>: Paul, <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Johnny</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Paul, will Pitt ever land another football coach capable of making an impact like Johnny Majors or Jackie Sherrill? All who have followed, except maybe for Dave Wannstadt, have been pale imitations. Of course, the jury is out on Narduzzi. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No because this is a different time and place in college football. What they can do is build a program a little at a time like Pat Narduzzi is doinf <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It takes time he can’t bring in 70 guys</p>
<p><strong>ZO</strong>: Top 5 hockey players of all-time in order are? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Wow - Gretzky Lemieux orr Howe Crosby</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Paul, how far did the Archer trade set the Pirates back? My guess is that it has seriously handicapped them for at least five years by potentially robbing the team of three productive starters. And, now, it appears that they will buy him out of his option next year and get nothing in return. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well you take three top prospects away that you would have had for 8 years it is tough to replace. Glasnow could be an ace, Meadows your centerfield and Baz a top reliever. It was an awful trade</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: What winter sport summertime playoff are you most looking forward to, NBA or NHL? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I love hoops but there is nothing like the Stanley Cup playoffs. And now we have five rounds of it. I am so pumped I can not wait!</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: My Cleveland friends seem to be more excited than ever in anticipation of the NFL season. Are they right, or hopeful fools? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think the Browns will be really good. I do. I think they will win ten games or so. They have the coach to do it too I think</p>
<p><strong>PIT in FLA</strong>: Watched the SuperBowl 43 rerun, what a game, what a defense, Woodley and Harrison were stellar! Ben stunk it up pretty good but that last drive was quite a two man show of the ages, Santonio seems like a good and greatful dude, Thoughts? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: That defense was so much fun to watch. They were dominant and they really brought the wood to quarterbacks. And the offensive line stunk but Ben made his magic and they made it work</p>
<p><strong>PIT in FLA</strong>: Ironic, but true, the NHL in my opinion has the most TV fan friendly broadcast format. Already played in a fish bowl and far fewer stoppages of play, you can watch a game in 2 hours and its pretty intense. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I agree. I think that hockey is the best sport to watch on TV</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: To me there's a simple compromise for baseball owners and plays. The league agrees to the 82 game schedule with the prorated salaries and in return the players allow the owners to pay some portion of the prorated salaries over the next three years interest free. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: That makes way too much sense</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Paul, How many years has the Archer trade set back the Bucco's to being competitive? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Like I said before - a few at least. You don’t replace those kinds of talented prospects easily</p>
<p><strong>PIT in FLA</strong>: Paul, How does not having training camp on site give teams more control over virus exposure? St Vincent is a lockdown situation for players, no variables as far as what they do before or after practice? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think the key is they save a ton of money and they will be able to control outsiders coming in and out</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: In your years of covering Pittsburgh sports teams, including Pitt, how tolerant would you say the locker rooms have been? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: That’s a great question. I would say pretty diverse and tolerant. There were some times when there was a clear divide between the groups of players. It is tough with 105 players there are going to be differences. The most tolerant/diverse group was with Wanny because he promoted that</p>
<p><strong>Rod Helmut</strong>: Hi Paul, Don't you think they are putting the defense in a bad position if they plan to have Vince Williams on the field more than last year? (without Barron, seems they will) <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It seems like he won’t be on the field as much because they will use the hybrid safety position</p>
<p><strong>Bizzee Bee</strong>: Would you rather watch the early 90s Penguins versus Black Hawks Stanley Cup or the upcoming Stanley Cup playoffs? Give me Mario, Tochett, Jagr, Stevens, Murphy, Barasso, etc . . . all day! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes those teams were a lot of fun to watch. And they played an exciting brand of hockey</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Totally agree with Brees response above. You cant say or do anything anymore without massive attacks from either side. When does credibility or history matter? Brees has been a great leader and has done great things for that city, including winning a super bowl and donating to his community. Maybe people should think about before rushing to judgement and slamming him. How about giving him a break regardless of how horrible things are right now. He has done plenty to show he is not a racist <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: There is an angry mob that consider themselves woke and the arbitrators of what every one is supposed to think</p>
<p><strong>John Spartan</strong>: When Majors came he had no limitations. Since Pitt Stadium was so big, he sent 2 voucers for tickets to every high school in most of PA. Got to see Dorsett's first home game that way. Each ticket was good for 2 people, except for the Notre Dame Game. Can't do that anymore, for sure. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Like I said - it helps to be able to sign 80+ players in one class.</p>
<p><strong>PIT in FLA</strong>: Should the Stanley Cup have an asterisk this year? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No the winner will have to go through an an <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: gauntlet</p>
<p><strong>Vm R 3</strong>: Johnny Majors went undefeated and won a National Championship in '76, with not the 1st String QB Haygood ( out for year after the first game), Not the 2nd QB, Cavanaugh, but using the 3rd String walkon Tom Yewcic for 3 important games in the middle of the campaign. What does that say about the Steeler's and Tomlin preparedness for their team last year? or for their response and adjustment once disaster struck? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It says we shouldn’t compare college to pro football <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Ok that’s it for me I’m done have a great weekend thanks for all the great questions</p>
