<h1>Tuned In: How COVID-19 crisis impacts what you see on TV</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It didn’t take long for the global COVID-19 pandemic to impact what viewers see on TV, and what’s happened so far may be just the beginning of changes from the TV routine.</p>
<p>Most live or live-to-tape entertainment programs have ceased production, including late-night shows, along with live sporting events.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="blank"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>However, on Monday CBS&nbsp;“Late Show” host Stephen Colbert started recording timely, amusing monologues from his home that air at the start of episodes that are otherwise reruns. (Jimmy Fallon is now doing something similar on NBC’s&nbsp;“Tonight Show.”)&nbsp;“Conan” on TBS will resume airing full new episodes on March 30, albeit shot on iPhone remotely without an audience or in-person guests, <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/conan-obrien-coronavirus-late-night-tv-return-1203538620/" target="_blank">per Variety</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to these immediate changes, the effects of this global crisis will be felt further down the road, too.</p>
<p>While some shows have already wrapped for the season, including the final season of ABC’s “Modern Family,” pretty much all other scripted prime-time series have gone on an unplanned production hiatus, including ABC’s “Grey’s Anatomy” and several shows scheduled to end their series runs, Fox’s “Empire” and “Supernatural.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear what will happen to the programs nearing their endpoints. Will they get an opportunity to end on their own terms or will they just stop?</p>
<p>For shows expected to return in the fall, odds are many won’t ramp back up production for just a few more episodes. Instead, they’ll likely end their seasons one-to-four episodes short of their 2019-20 season orders, per Vulture.com.</p>
<p>NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” is on hiatus until further notice and FX has pulled its planned April 19 launch of the fourth season of “Fargo,” which was still in production in Chicago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Awards shows, including the “2020 Billboard Music Awards” slated for April 29, will be postponed and rescheduled at a later date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, game shows “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune,” which had already switched to audience-free tapings, suspended production entirely.</p>
<p>Daytime soaps have also shut down, although <a href="https://tvline.com/2020/03/18/daytime-soap-operas-coronavirus-young-and-restless-episodes/" target="_blank">they produce episodes between one and eight months in advance </a>so it will be a while before some of those programs run out of original episodes. ABC temporarily replaced daytime’s “GMA3: Strahan, Sara and Keke” with “Pandemic: What You Need to Know.”</p>
<p>Showtime’s “Black Monday” will shift from two episodes premiering each Sunday to one episode per week through April 12 due to delays in post-production work on episodes. HBO Max delayed the production of its unscripted&nbsp;“Friends” reunion special that was expected to film next week, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/friends-reunion-special-delayed-at-hbo-max-1285276?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News_2020-03-18%2015:30:00_lgoldberg&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews" target="_blank">per The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>
<p>Some networks have begun rolling out reruns in place of previously scheduled original episodes: The CW’s “Legends of Tomorrow” has switched from originals to reruns on March 24 and 31 and “The Flash” will now be a rerun on March 31.</p>
<p>The stockpiling of originals is necessary in the event some programs never resume production on their current seasons. That will allow the networks to have original episodes leftover in May to use to launch summer series. Of course, some of those summer shows could conceivably get pushed to fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impact on what viewers see on TV will likely linger longer than the 2019-20 TV season, which wraps in May.</p>
<p>Networks have tabled production of pilot episodes of potential new series that would normally be announced at the upfronts in May (the upfronts have all been moved from splashy New York venues to online-only presentations due to COVID-19). It’s unclear when those productions might gear up.</p>
<p>Some new shows may wind up skipping the pilot process and go straight to series. Depending on the duration of the current hunker down mode, the TV season that typically starts in September could get pushed back.</p>
<p>Showtime’s Jeff Daniels-starring “Rust,” which was scheduled to begin filming in Western Pennsylvania this month, has been delayed at least two weeks although it seems likely that will be longer.</p>
<p>CBS’s “The Amazing Race” stopped running and production on the 41st season of “Survivor” has been delayed.</p>
<p>How much these delays and production shutdowns will impact viewers will likely depend on how long COVID-19 lingers. But it’s wise for viewers to expect the next three-to-six months (or more) will not follow the usual comfortable TV season rhythms.</p>
<p>And yet, more viewers are now available for the same reason that TV shows have stopped production.</p>
<p>Nielsen reports staying at home can result in an almost 60% increase in the amount of content we consume. And live TV viewing, which has been on the decline for years, has already slowed its year-to-year decline.</p>
<p>Mike Mulvihill, a Fox Sports executive, tweeted Monday that TV usage, which had declined 7% year-to-date, was down just 2% last week. On Monday night, CBS saw its show’s ratings rise, with freshman sitcom “Bob (Hearts) Abishola,” starring Swissvale native Billy Gardell, tying its season high.</p>
<p>As more people stay home, that trend is likely to continue. Nielsen reported a 17% increase in TV usage in South Korea from the second to the fourth week of February when the number of coronavirus cases surged. Italy also saw an increase in TV usage.</p>
<p>But some of the biggest increases in content consumption may come through online streaming.</p>
<p>Data shared by Sensor Tower found Netflix app downloads in Italy spiked 57% when millions went into self-isolation; Spain saw a 34% increase in Netflix app downloads. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gaming-usage-up-75-percent-coronavirus-outbreak-verizon-reports-1285140?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News_now_2020-03-17%2016:49:46_tberesford&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews" target="_blank">Verizon says</a> video streaming usage increased by 12% in the last week and video game usage was up by 75% during peak hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Streamers are trying to use the increased viewer availability to get their wares sampled. Over the weekend, Disney+ added “Frozen 2” months ahead of schedule. Universal Pictures will bypass closed movie theaters and make upcoming “Trolls World Tour” (April 10) and already-released films (“The Hunt,” “The Invisible Man,” ‘Emma”) available on demand for $19.99 for a 48-hour rental period.</p>
<p>Acorn.tv, home to the newest season of “Doc Martin” (not on PBS stations until January 2021) and a slew of other international series, extended its seven-day free trial to 30 days for new subscribers through Dec. 31 (code: FREE30). Sister-streamer Sundance Now made the same move (code: SUNDANCENOW30).</p>
<p><strong>‘One Day at a Time’ returns</strong></p>

<p>Self-quarantine may also work to the benefit of canceled Netflix feel-good comedy “One Day at a Time,” which returns for its fourth season on cable’s Pop TV at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
<p>The show, a reimagining of the 1975-84 CBS sitcom of the same title, follows three-generations of a Cuban-American family and stars Justina Machado and Rita Moreno. It’s a traditionally-formatted, warm-hearted sitcom that embraces topical issues, particularly those impacting the show’s Latinx characters.</p>
<p>The premiere kicks off with a humorous dig at Netflix, a Ray Romano guest appearance and an opening scene that introduces the characters and their relationships for any new viewers who might be tuning in.</p>
