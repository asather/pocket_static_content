<h1>Former Coldwell Banker agent to admit to role in prison narcotics ring</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former real estate agent from Sewickley is set to admit to her role in a criminal gang that smuggled drug-saturated paper into the U.S. prison system and sold drugs across the region shipped here from New Jersey.</p>
<p>Michel Cercone, a mother of four who worked for Coldwell Banker, will plead guilty next month before a federal judge, according to court papers filed Tuesday.</p>
<p>She is among 48 people under indictment in federal court in Pittsburgh in connection with the ring, which according to federal agents sold drugs to inmates on the inside and distributed narcotics throughout Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Ms. Cercone is charged with conspiracy to deal drugs and launder money and held a leadership role under accused ringleader Noah Landfried of Moon, according to wiretap evidence developed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
<p>Ms. Cercone's involvement was revealed on tapped phones and a recording device that agents planted inside the truck of an accused co-conspirator, James Perry of Ambridge.</p>
<p>Agents said that Landfried and Perry received drug shipments from New Jersey. They then distributed to customers in and out of prison.</p>
<p>Ms. Cercone helped them sell the drugs and collect the money, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>The recording device in the truck exposed Ms. Cercone discussing the drug dealing and her own side business of selling narcotic pills. One of the tapped phones revealed her complaining about being tired because she was up all night working on the "stupid paper" â€” a reference to preparing the drug-saturated paper to smuggle into the prisons for inmates to smoke or chew.</p>
<p>Ms. Cercone also was a drug user, according to the secret recordings, telling Mr. Perry that she only likes small amounts of cocaine because when she uses more, "I get retarded."</p>
<p>A tap of another phone used by accused co-conspirator Christopher Gahagan of Ambridge also indicates that Ms. Cercone was directly involved in selling drugs and bringing in money.</p>
<p>All the while she was selling drugs, agents said, she was showing houses as a real estate agent and living quietly on Orchard Terrace in Sewickley.</p>
