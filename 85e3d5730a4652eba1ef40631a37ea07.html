<h1>COVID-19 Update: Pa. reports a drop in new cases with 384; Pittsburgh region sees 130 more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania on Monday reported its lowest daily increase in COVID-19 cases since mid-July, with 384 new cases and no new deaths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the newest cases, the state now has 124,844 total cases of the virus.</p>
<p>Western Pennsylvania accounts for 130 of the newly reported infections, with Allegheny County having the highest increase for Monday with 71 new cases, followed by Cambria County with 10, and Washington and Westmoreland counties, seven each.</p>
<p>The last time the state saw a daily increase in the 300-range was on July 13.</p>
<p>The new infections in Allegheny were diagnosed from 944 tests taken between Aug. 11 and 16. Those testing positive range in age from 1 month to 97, with a median age of 47.&nbsp;The county’s total now stands at 9,504 cases of the virus since the pandemic began in mid-March.</p>
<p>For the fourth week in a row, the county’s average number of cases per day has decreased. The average number of cases for Aug. 4 through Aug. 10 was about 89 cases. For Aug. 11 through Aug. 17 it has decreased to about 82 cases. Over that same time frame, the state average rose from about 757 cases to 770.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department is reporting two additional deaths that occurred on Aug. 6 and Aug. 7, and included one person in their 80s and one in their 90s.</p>
<p>Statewide the death toll stands at 7,468.</p>
<p>The county health department did not include new hospitalization data in its daily report because the data “goes back to late June,” they said.&nbsp;Based on the latest state data, there are currently 101 people hospitalized in Allegheny County with COVID-19, of those 23 are currently requiring mechanical ventilation.&nbsp;In total, the county has had 870 people hospitalized with COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>On Friday, the state updated its <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Travelers.aspx" target="_blank">travel recommendations</a> for Pennsylvania residents, removing Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin from the high risk travel list.</p>
