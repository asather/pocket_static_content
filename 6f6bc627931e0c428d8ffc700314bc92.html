<h1>Despite uptick in some online gambling, casino revenues seeing a staggering drop</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>First, the good news for the Pennsylvania gaming industry: Revenue for online casino-type games skyrocketed 73 percent in April compared to the previous month — from $24.9 million to $43.1 million, according to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>Now the related, really bad news: Since all 12 casinos in the state were order closed on March 16 to help stem&nbsp;the spread of COVID-19, overall casino revenue from all wagers&nbsp;—&nbsp;retail slots and table games, sports book wagering and online betting — dropped a staggering 84 percent in April compared to the same month a year earlier, from nearly $284 million in April 2019 to a little more than $46 million in April 2020.</p>
<p>The internet casino games include slot machines, table games and poker. The biggest increase posted was in the slot machine segment in which revenue more than doubled, going from $12.9 million in March to $27.3 million, the PGCB report noted.</p>
<p>But other virtual betting didn’t fare as well. Without the wagering mainstays of collegiate and professional sports for gamblers to virtually wager on, sports betting revenue from 13 retail and nine online sites dropped 58% below March totals, declining from $7.9 million to $2.8 million. And fantasy contests dropped a jaw-dropping 91% compared to April 2019, sliding from $1.9 to only $157,254.</p>
<p>As COVID-19 has wreaked havoc in all segments of the economy, so too has it devastated the gaming industry in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, putting thousands of employees out of work and harming other individuals, businesses and governments that financially depend upon a robust casino landscape. The state alone is losing $100 million a month in tax revenue from the shutdown of casinos, PGCB spokesman Doug Harbach said.</p>
<p>“Just as importantly” he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, “thousands of Pennsylvanians whose livelihood depends on the casinos are away from work. That, of course, is devastating.</p>
<p>“A bright note has been the decision by the Legislature and governor in 2017 to permit online gaming which has made Pennsylvania one of just a few states that has continued to generate some needed gaming tax revenue during the closures.”</p>
<p>Neither Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh nor the Meadows Racetrack &amp; Casino in Washington County has its own internet sites for the casino-type games of slot machines, table games and poker. Instead, their websites direct visitors to their sister casinos elsewhere in Pennsylvania which operate the sites — Rivers Casino Philadelphia and Hollywood Casino at Penn National, Granville, Dauphin County, respectively.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino Philadelphia reported total internet games revenue of $13.7 million while Penn National reported total internet games revenue of $4.6 million.</p>
<p>As for sports wagering revenue, both Rivers Pittsburgh and the Meadows show precipitous drops from March. At the Rivers, total revenue was $168,662 in April compared to $666,130 in March. At the Meadows, total revenue was $706,589 in April, or about half of the $1.5 million recorded in March. Rivers was among a half dozen casinos that had already voluntarily closed earlier in March by the time Gov. Tom Wolf ordered the remaining six, including the Meadows, to shut down operations on March 16.</p>
