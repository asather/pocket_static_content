<h1>Federal grant to support organizations that bore brunt of Tree of Life massacre, aftermath</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An archival memorial will be one result of an almost $3.9 million federal grant to the state to support nine Pittsburgh organizations that bore the brunt of the Tree of Life synagogue massacre in Squirrel Hill in 2018 and its aftermath.</p>
<p>The grant is provided through the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency from the U.S. Department of Justice's Antiterrorism and Emergency Assistance Program.</p>
<p>Kathleen Buckley, a spokeswoman for the state commission, said the PCCD&nbsp;applied for the grant on behalf of the organizations, and then the federal&nbsp;Office for Victims of Crime conducted a needs assessment to determine allocation amounts. She said the organizations still technically need to apply for their funds.</p>
<p>The grants will help reimburse the organizations for incurred expenses and losses and for their continuing efforts to serve their clientele, including helping them heal from trauma.</p>
<p>The grantees are the Jewish Community Center of Pittsburgh, $2,351,306; Jewish Family and Community Services, $335,344; the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, $420,128; the Center for Victims, $15,000; and the three congregations that shared the synagogue — Congregation Dor Hadash, $140,090; New Light Congregation, $77,010, and Tree of Life - Or L’Simcha Congregation, $524,728.</p>
<p>The JCC is the fiscal agent for the 10.27 Healing Partnership, which is to get $1.9 million of the JCC's share, and the Federation is the fiscal agent of the Rauh Jewish History Program &amp; Archives at the Heinz History Center, whose share is $234,000.</p>
<p>The recipient agencies all collaborated on the formation of the 10.27 Healing Partnership — which derives its name from the date of the shootings, when 11 were killed and six were injured, including four police officers. It is a designated resilience center, recognized as such by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Until the pandemic prevented in-person counseling and healing work, people could walk in the door at the JCC, 5738 Forbes Ave., Squirrel Hill, said Maggie Feinstein, director of the 10.27 partnership. The grant will help 10.27 continue to transition to virtual healing and support, she said.</p>
<p>"We've had a pretty good transition" to virtual support, she said. That has included grief counseling, relaxation techniques and biofeedback.</p>
<p>The Rauh archives' portion will be used to catalog, scan and photograph all of the hundreds of thousands of memorial items that were sent to the congregations and left at the site of the synagogue.</p>
<p>Thousands of documents, including letters and sympathy cards, make up 181 linear feet of materials that will be photographed, cataloged and presented on a website.</p>
<p>Eric Lidji, director of the Rauh Jewish History Program &amp; Archives, said he expects this project to take a year.</p>
<p>He said the grant recognizes the power of memorabilia that people share in response to grief.</p>
<p>"Memorial objects keep recurring at these violent events, so there is a recognition of the role they play in the communal healing process," he said. "Each item will be scanned or photographed, with detailed cataloging so people can find each thing quickly."</p>
<p>Jordan Golin, president &amp; CEO of Jewish Family and Community Services, said the funding will help the JFCS "continue to help the community heal today, tomorrow and in the months and years ahead. Recovery from trauma is a long process, and our trauma therapists and case managers, funded by this grant, will continue helping grieving families and community members receive the professional support that they need — free of charge."</p>
<p>For weeks after the shootings, people left flowers, painted rocks, candles, messages and signs, teddy bears, hand-sewn items and artwork that covered a full block from the intersection of Shady and Wilkins avenues where the synagogue is located.</p>
<p>When cold weather set in, the flowers we're gathered up, many of them for composting at Shadyside Worms, and the other items were all cataloged and packed up. Some were placed inside the building for people to see them through the glass.</p>
<p>Mr. Lidji said he has had the unique experience of seeing all the items as a collective trove of grief. One teddy bear or painted rock doesn't represent the magnitude of horror, but the impact of all of it together does, he said.</p>
<p>"Each of these items came from someone, heartbroken enough to be compelled to create it and then send it. When you think about the emotional effort of one person then multiply it thousands of times, you get the scale of the emotional damage and pain.</p>
<p>"There will be something healing about navigating [the site] with other people and feeling part of a large world of emotion."</p>
<p>He said that a source of inspiration for the project is <a href="ttps://marathon.library.northeastern.edu" target="_blank">"Our Marathon,</a>" a website that showcases things collected after the Boston Marathon bombing.</p>
<p>The Rauh’s website will grow over time, as more people feel comfortable having their items included, the grief still being fresh, he said.</p>
<p>As for the objects that people have shared, he said, they provide "a remarkable record of the many ways people all over the world responded to that terrible act. These objects are filled with humanity — grief, love, heartache, friendship, pain, and hope. We are so grateful for the opportunity to preserve and share these objects, and we hope that this project will help people in their ongoing effort to heal.”</p>
