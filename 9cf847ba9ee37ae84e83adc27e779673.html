<h1>Amid massive teen unemployment, outdoor youth employers find success</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Teenager Xander Hill was bummed about his summer. This spring, it looked like he’d miss out on his favorite job: being a lifeguard at Shaler’s Crawford Swimming Pool.</p>
<p>Then, last month during a family dinner, his mom exclaimed from across the table, “Hey, the pool is going to open!”</p>
<p>“I put down what I was eating, she showed me the email, and I started filling out my forms at that minute,” he said.</p>
<p>Xander, 16, is one of the few teenagers who’ve found stable employment in the summer of the coronavirus. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, teen unemployment skyrocketed with the shutdowns — going from 14.3% in March to 31.9% in April.</p>
<p>That rate dropped to 29.9% in May, but last year that figure stood at 12.4%. And that doesn’t account for all the discouraged workers who’ve given up searching.</p>
<p>Although the high unemployment makes it seem like new hires would be easy to come by, that’s not always the case. Virtual interviews and concerns over the coronavirus have slowed hiring substantially, said Kennywood Park spokesperson Nick Paradise.</p>
<p>After five days set aside for season pass holders, Kennywood Park and its sister parks, Sandcastle Waterpark and Idlewild &amp; SoakZone, will reopen to the public on July 11.</p>
<p>To fully reopen, the amusement park in West Mifflin needs young workers and lots of them. The park is the Pittsburgh area’s biggest youth employer, bringing about 1,500 student workers aboard each summer — a figure that should stand even in the age of COVID-19, Mr. Paradise said.</p>
<p>“We’re hiring for every department at this point,” he said, including ride operations, lifeguards, food servers, housekeeping, the whole lot.</p>
<p>The amusement park hires teens as young as 14, and about half of employees are rehires from previous years.</p>
<p>New hires at Kennywood and Sandcastle make $8 an hour if they’re 14 or 15; $9 an hour if they’re 16 or older. Hourly rates for new Idlewild employees are $7.30 for 14- and 15-year-olds and between $8.35 and $9.35 for those older than 16. Lifeguards make $11 an hour at Sandcastle and $11.05 at Idlewild.</p>
<p>Since mid-March, the Kennywood teams have been conducting new hire interviews through Skype.</p>
<p>To make the theme parks run in the pandemic era, employees will have to adopt a plethora of precautions. They’re implementing temperature checks where if any employees exceed 100.4 degrees, they don’t go to work that day. Masks and social distancing are mandatory, and certain jobs may use face shields and gloves as required, Mr. Paradise said.</p>
<p>Although the park will be limiting capacity, he expects a higher staff-to-attendee ratio than years past to keep up with all the new responsibilities the pandemic brings.</p>
<p>Of employers finding success in hiring in the Pittsburgh area, many of them have jobs that require working outdoors, and they are relying on sizable returning classes of student employees.</p>
<p>The Crawford pool officially reopened on June 13, with two major changes. Attendees must register online, and the pool day is broken into three shifts, separated by two 30-minute periods for sanitation.</p>
<p>“Shaler is fortunate in that many of the lifeguards we’ve brought to the pool are returning from last year, around 70% of them,” said Judy Kording, assistant township manager.</p>
<p>Xander Hill is among those returning, an employee whom Ms. Kording called “phenomenal.” He got his start last year checking pool passes as a sub-lifeguard, and he worked as many shifts as he could. Now, he works full time for $11 an hour.</p>
<p>Shaler’s pool has a little over a dozen pool staff on-site at all times, and pool occupancy is limited to 200 people at a time. Everyone except the seated lifeguards have to wear masks.</p>
<p>From their elevated posts, Xander and the other guards can maintain distance and maximize their line of sight on swimmers. Still, he’s wondered how to carry out the job when physical contact is such a complicated subject these days.</p>
<p>“I’m going to have to eventually, you know, save somebody,” he said. “As soon as that would be done, I’d go to the bathroom and clean myself off. I actually have hand sanitizer in my pack so I could disinfect after cleaning.”</p>
<p>He’s the only one in his group of friends with a job. For his buddies, “their pool isn’t open or their grocery store already has enough people,” he said.</p>
<p>A major driver of youth employment in Pittsburgh is the Learn &amp; Earn program, a $4.5 million city endeavor that connects low-income students from age 14 to 21 with six-week paid summer jobs that match their interests.&nbsp;The students work between 20 and 30 hours every week for minimum wage.</p>
<p>Starting June 29 after a four-day orientation, 25 local organizations will bring aboard student workers in a range of virtual, in-person and hybrid experiences.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Student Conservation Association will bring on 60 student workers to six city work sites, program manager Joanna Lemmon said.</p>
<p>A couple of the locations include the MLK Community Garden in the Hill District, where students will maintain the garden and build a trail around it, and South Side Park, where they’ll maintain the trail and clear out invasive plant species, among other duties.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Ms. Lemmon has been training with other staff at Camp Guyasuta in Sharpsburg, getting a test run of conservation during COVID-19. All the precautions will make things tougher on the students.</p>
<p>“We’ll be practicing social distancing, which can be challenging when you’re moving a 200-pound rock,” Ms. Lemmon said.</p>
<p>The jobs require physical labor and tool usage, so mask-wearing and sanitization will slow things down. To Ms. Lemmon, the mental recognition is more challenging than physical work; before you use this tool, can I clean it off first?</p>
<p>Not that the physical demands are anything to sneeze at. She and the other crew leaders have been “sucking wind” through their masks, walking up trails with heavy tools.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, she believes the precautions will be worth it.</p>
<p>“You might not get as much work done, but we will have 73 people employed this summer who otherwise may not have been employed,” she said.</p>
<p>At times like these, the physical labor can be therapeutic, she said. It’s a chance to take out aggression, unify toward a common goal.</p>
<p>“Especially right now it feels really good, being locked inside with all that’s going on. It’s like you can actually make a difference with a rock. It sounds stupid, but it’s satisfying,” she said.</p>
<p>It’s exactly what Xander said of being a lifeguard. After months of being cooped up inside, his enthusiasm for working at Shaler’s pool nullifies any inconvenience the pandemic creates.</p>
<p>“It’s probably my favorite place to be right now. It gets me out of the house. I love doing that stuff. I love helping other people.”&nbsp;</p>
