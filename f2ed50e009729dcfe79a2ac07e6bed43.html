<h1>Pitt mailbag: What's a realistic, long-term goal for the Panthers in the ACC?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Each week through the end of the 2019-20 season, Craig Meyer, the Post-Gazette’s Pitt basketball writer, will answer reader questions about the Panthers. And some other stuff, too.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to submit a question, you can email Craig at cmeyer@post-gazette.com or hit him up on Twitter @CraigMeyerPG.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Craig,&nbsp;As an unbiased observer and beat writer for Pitt hoops what do you think is the most realistic long term goal for Pitt finishing in the ACC standings?&nbsp;I am not talking about this season I am talking long term. Like 5 years from now.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I think when you project what the long-term outlook for this program is, there are reasons for hope, but there’s also a ceiling.</p>
<p>Since Pitt joined the ACC in 2013, it has finished in an average position of 11th (of 15 teams). That average is bogged down heavily by the pitfalls of the Kevin Stallings era —&nbsp;its average was about eighth under Jamie Dixon — but that also highlights that there’s no sort of divine right the Panthers have to be better than any programs in the conference, even what some would perceive to be the league’s weakest schools. The good news is that the first three of those seasons were part of a somewhat awkward transition to a new league and the final three come from a time in which Pitt was at its lowest point as a program in two decades. Aside from their fifth-place finish in 2014, the Panthers haven’t really been playing close to what they were for much of the 2000s.</p>
<p>Having said that, though, they’re in a league with three of college basketball’s top 10 all-time programs — North Carolina, Duke and Louisville — and have a fourth in Virginia that is led by maybe the sport’s best coach right now. Since Pitt joined the ACC, Duke and Virginia have finished in the top five of the conference standings five times (of a possible six) while North Carolina has done so all six times and Louisville has finished in the top five in three of its five years in the league. There’s hope that Pitt can break into that group — Florida State and Miami have done so twice, and Notre Dame has three times —&nbsp;but I’m not as confident they’ll be able to do so consistently. There’s no shame in being in the second tier of this kind of conference, which would be a fair goal to shoot for.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Honda Days</strong>: For men’s basketball, is the ACC bad this season or is there just a lot of parity? Only three teams with zero or one conference loss and it’s only mid-January.</p>
<p><strong>Craig:</strong> I think the lack of a dominant team (or dominant set of teams) is hurting any number of conferences this season, but the ACC’s problems go beyond parity. I wouldn’t say it’s bad, but this is undeniably a down year for the league. Not only is it not the top conference in college basketball, but I don’t even think it’s one of the top three this season, at least so far. Duke looks like the favorite and though I’m still skeptical of both, Florida State and Louisville both look to be very good. Beyond that, though? Woof.</p>
<p>More than anything, I think it’s due to the surprisingly poor state of some of its top, generally most consistent programs. North Carolina looks to have one of its worst teams in decades. Same for Syracuse. Virginia is struggling after losing its top three scorers from last season’s national championship squad. The good news in all of this for Pitt is that as maddening as it has been this season, there’s room for advancement. This isn’t your seven-year-old older brother’s ACC.</p>
<p><strong>Trim:</strong> Question for your next mailbag: bad shooters or bad offensive flow leading to low % shots ... or both?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I think it’s a bit of both, along with some bad luck. Rewatching the games, Pitt still misses a decent amount of open or at least good looks. Still, there has been some disappointment for a team that, when it came to outside shooting, had little margin for error. Ryan Murphy, who was supposed to provide the team with a reliable gunner after losing Jared Wilson-Frame, is shooting just 33% from 3. Justin Champagnie has what looks like a nice stroke, but he’s unbelievably streaky (and shooting just 25% on the season). Only two Pitt players are shooting better than 45% this season and both of them are big men (Eric Hamilton and Terrell Brown). Even when the added difficulty of making 3s is factored in, they’re still the only two with an effective field goal percentage of higher than 49%.</p>
<p>For anyone who has watched a reasonable amount of Pitt basketball this season, though, shot selection can’t be totally discarded here. It has been disastrous at times.</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: Which assistant coach is considered the #1 recruiter?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: With a head coach like Jeff Capel who is as accomplished a recruiter as he is — and involved with it as he is here at Pitt — it can be tricky to say. But I feel like I hear signees and players, once they get here, mention Jason Capel the most when they discuss their recruitment.</p>
<p>Recruiting is all about relationships and that can often mean familiarity or expertise with a certain area. With the Pitt staff, it’s pretty divided along the eastern seaboard. Tim O’Toole works a lot in the northeast. Milan Brown has a lot of connections in the mid-Atlantic, especially in the DC-Maryland-Virginia corridor. Jason Capel has deep roots in the Carolinas, as well as Virginia. If you look at where Pitt has gotten most of its incoming freshman recruits, the map would reflect as much.</p>
<p><strong>Aileen:</strong> I loved watching Ronald Ramon when he played at Pitt. Is he doing any recruiting in NYC? I know his title is director of basketball operations but didn’t know if that included recruiting responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Ramon is an assistant director of operations, so much of his recruiting activity is limited to logistics on visits. Almost all the recruiting is handled by Jeff Capel and his three assistants. Beyond that, his job responsibilities include what Pitt describes as “alumni engagement and community service activities.”</p>
<p><strong>Corey</strong>: Is Ryan Tannehill actually good? I just don’t think I could accept that.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I don’t think the Titans advancing has all that much to do with him, as he has thrown for only a combined 160 yards in those two playoff wins. But the fact Tennessee was even in the playoffs is absolutely attributable to him. I’d say he’s pretty good. There’s a good case to be made that he was mishandled or misused in Miami and even then, if you look at his final four seasons there, he was decent or, at worst, average.</p>
<p>I would make the argument, though, that this playoff run has shown that the Titans have an excellent team around Tannehill and that, to best maximize that, they should shoot for an upgrade at quarterback this offseason (like maybe Cam Newton). Tannehill has been incredible this season, but I also think that’s probably a bit of an aberration. He’s good, but not <em>that</em> good.</p>
