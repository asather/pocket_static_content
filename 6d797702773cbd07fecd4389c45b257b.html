<h1>After transferring to Pitt, Nike Sibande can live dream of playing in ACC</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Growing up in an area as synonymous with basketball as any place in the United States, Nike Sibande had any number of options when it came to his college basketball fandom.</p>
<p>About an hour southwest of his family’s home in Indianapolis is Indiana University, with its five national championships and its claim to being one of the most storied programs in the history of the sport. A little more than an hour to the northwest is Purdue, an accomplished program in its own right. Two and a half hours directly north is Notre Dame and all the prestige that comes with that name. Across town is Butler, the plucky upstart that improbably made two national championships while he was developing a love for the game.</p>
<p>For Sibande, though, there was always a different program, one well past the borders of his home state, that captured his attention and affection: Duke. He dreamed of playing for coach Mike Krzyzewski and the Blue Devils. If he couldn’t make it there, he at least wanted to reach that level, which he saw as the apex of college basketball.</p>
<p>So, years later, when an ACC program led by a former Duke point guard and assistant coach came calling, he jumped at the opportunity.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, seemingly out of nowhere, it was revealed that Sibande had signed an aid agreement with Pitt, ending a months-long process following his transfer from Miami (Ohio). It’s a move, however, that has been years in the making, as the 6-foot-4 guard now gets to carve out a space for himself in a part of the college basketball landscape where he always hoped he would be.</p>
<p>“Just being in the opportunity to get to this level and be able to show what I can do, I’m excited for it, man,” Sibande said. “I just feel like the sky’s the limit for me now. I feel like I broke through. I’m just a kid out of Indianapolis. I don’t really come from too much. To get to this level, it’s amazing to me, man. This is what I’ve been waiting on my whole life.”</p>
<p>Sibande comes to Pitt after three years at Miami, where he averaged 15.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game over that span. As a sophomore, he reached his statistical apex, averaging 16.1 points per game, though his scoring dipped as a junior, down to 13.9 points per game. During that most recent season, though, he posted career highs in rebounds and assists per game (5.9 and 1.7, respectively) while his shooting percentage improved from 39.4% to 44%.</p>
<p>His RedHawks team languished for much of his career, never winning more than 16 games and finishing 13-19 last season. That lack of success was a drastic break from his high school career, during which he helped lead Crispus Attucks to a state championship in 2017, the school’s first since 1955, when NBA legend Oscar Robertson played for the school (and Attucks became the first all-Black school in the country to win an open state championship).</p>
<p>Eventually, Sibande longed for more from his college career, opting to transfer in late April.</p>
<p>“Nothing against my old school, but it was just a lower conference,” he said. “I wanted to get to a higher conference and compete against the best players.”</p>
<p>As he searched for a new home, Pitt had initially expressed interest, but the Panthers, several weeks into his re-recruitment, appeared to be out of the running. In early May, Sibande narrowed his list of suitors to five — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Georgetown and Xavier — a cut that came after he was reportedly contacted by Kentucky and Creighton, among others, within 24 hours of his name entering the transfer portal.</p>
<p>So how does a player ultimately choose a school he didn’t have publicly under consideration? Sibande said he made his top five relatively early, only a little more than a week after his transfer was first reported, and that, to him, the list “didn’t really mean anything. It was just trying to find the right spot.”</p>
<p>Coach Jeff Capel and his staff were nonetheless persistent, and the more he spoke with the Panthers’ coaches, the more he was intrigued by the possibility of heading to Western Pennsylvania to finish his career.</p>
<p>“The relationship with them was really better than it was with everybody else,” Sibande said. “That’s why I picked it.”</p>
<p>Those decisions, both to leave Miami and to pick a new program, didn’t come easily, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic overhauled what would have been a normal recruiting process. He talked with coaches via video conferencing. He took virtual tours of campuses, something that didn’t bother him, as he sees a physical campus visit as “just eye candy.” While his final decision qualified as a surprise, it wasn’t due to a lack of care.</p>
<p>Along with his relationship with Capel, Sibande was receptive to the vision Pitt’s coach presented to him. They were impressed with his athleticism and his scoring ability, the latter of which was especially relevant as players with nearly 1,500 career points are seldom available in mid-June. Though the Panthers, aided by a top-20 recruiting class, figure to be deeper and more talented than they have been in recent years, Sibande does help address a need. Prior to his signing, Pitt had only three scholarship guards — Xavier Johnson, Delaware transfer Ithiel Horton and freshman Femi Odukale — raising some questions about depth at that position.</p>
<p>Sibande theoretically helps mitigate that concern.</p>
<p>“They’ve definitely got to be worried about me when I’m on the floor,” Sibande said. “I’m not somebody you can leave open or just leave out or forget about. I just want to be a spark and be a good teammate, try to be a good scorer and get my teammates involved and just bring the best attitude I can.”</p>
<p>The question with him then becomes not only how much he can contribute and in what ways he can produce, but when he will be able to do so.</p>
<p>Having completed his junior season in March, Sibande has one season of eligibility remaining, but since he is not a graduate transfer, he does not qualify for immediate eligibility. In order for him to play during the 2020-21 season, should it happen, Sibande would need to file for a waiver that would require NCAA approval.</p>
<p>Whether or not a waiver gets the NCAA’s rubber stamp can be a convoluted ordeal that makes predicting if a player gets cleared a fruitless endeavor. With the uncertainty brought about by the pandemic, Sibande believes he has a compelling case.</p>
<p>“All this stuff going on right now could definitely help,” Sibande said. “I’m just going to pray that it does and pray for the best.”</p>
<p>Should he be eligible, a Pitt team that was 154th of 353 Division I teams in offensive efficiency last season will get a proven scorer in its backcourt. Additionally, it will get an experienced player on a team that has only one other senior.</p>
<p>If he has to sit a year, Sibande said, that will be fine, a possibility he keeps locked in his mind as he heads to campus on Saturday. It will, as he put it, be another step in his journey that he can carry with him. The 2020-21 season, though, would offer him something valuable the campaign after it wouldn’t — a chance to play at Duke.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be amazing,” Sibande said. “It’s going to be a dream come true for me, playing at that stage and being at that level.”</p>
