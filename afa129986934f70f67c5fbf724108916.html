<h1>Paul Zeise's Steelers chat transcript: 01.09.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Good afternoon. Time to chat Steelers so let’s get started!!! And thanks for participating</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37 </strong>: Should quarterbacks have a separate salary cap ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: That’s actually a good thought but how would it work? I mean if you have a rookie QB, would you have to find two backups that need to be paid millions and millions to get to the cap? I like it the way it is - if you have a great QB you have an advantage. But you have to pay him a lot and that evens the playing field a little but with teams who don’t have a great QB because they have more money to spend on the team around him.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Krikorian</strong>: Thanks for the time Paul. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: You bet I enjoy this kind of interaction with people</p>
<p><strong>Old School</strong>: The offense line did not perform well this year. In your opinion, how much better, if at all, would the line have played if Munchak had stayed? Thank you. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It is hard to say. There would have been some improvement but Father Time is undefeated and I think some of the issue was simply they got old. Well at least a few of them. I think this is something to continue to watch but they need to get younger. I do think Munchak would have helped the run game out some</p>
<p><strong>JuJu 2017</strong>: Paul, any idea why Kevin Colbert continues to bring in FA Players that knowingly have durability issues? Vance McDonald, LaDarius Green? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well that is a small sample but I’ll say this - guys with an injury history in general are probably a little cheaper. If you take a shot at one and it turns out well you get a bargain player. It hasn’t worked out for those two but McDonald has had at least a few moments</p>
<p><strong>Lou</strong>: Happy New Year Paul! Surprise, you're the new GM on the Steelers...what's your big moves to improve the team this off-season? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well I certainly look to solidify the offensive line. I also either hire a new offensive line coach or I add a run game coordinator. I add a veteran running back. I add a veteran backup quarterback. I sign Bud Dupree. And in order to pay for it I move on from some guys like Anthony Chickillo, who has a bad contract that isn’t expensive to get out of and would save a lot of money</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: Should the Steelers forget about drafting DB's as long as Tomlin and Colbert are calling the shots? The outside infusion of Nelson, Haden, Minkah, and Hilton became necessary to cover their draft failures in this area. The jury may still be out on Edmunds but thus far it does not look good. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They have been pretty bad in this department haven’t they. Well sooner or later law of averages suggest they will get it right!</p>
<p><strong>Where is my CLARK bar?</strong>: Hi Paul, I agree with Ray's 2019 Steelers report card around looking for a young run stopper to make this defense even more legit. I'm also in the camp that Edmunds was the weak link and the Steelers MUST address this to become a truly elite defense. However, I do like the potential talent of Edmunds. Looking at his growth over the course of this year AND where he was his rookie year, can we be optimistic this potential may turn into production (ala Dupree)? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: When I watch Edmunds I see a guy who is probably a fourth round player who was drafted in the first round. He is not good in coverage but his run stopping ability means there is value. I think he can improve but I don’t think his ceiling is really high. So it is a position they need to address at some point. He isn’t a bust but he isn’t likely to be a first round talent ever, either</p>
<p><strong>NC Yinzer</strong>: I’ve read a lot of comments about us needing to draft a WR. I felt like it was rocky Start for Washington, Johnson and Ju Ju but other than Ju Ju, the other 2 looked pretty good. Especially considering shaky QB/OL play. I think our greatest need is either OL or TE. What do you think? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I agree they need a tight end that can play right away and should address that early. And they need one more offensive lineman. They could look to fortify the wide receiver spot with a bargain free agent or something but it shouldn’t be a priority</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Hi Paul - Thanks for the chat. Two unrelated questions. Would the offensive woes benefit from adding an OC that doesn't need a #7 to be effective? Do you think the talent in the WR room is sufficient to win a Super Bowl assuming the RB room remains status quo? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I’m not a fan of the competency and the ability of the offensive coordinator so my answer is I would make a change anyway. The receivers are dependent on JuJu Smith-Schuster. If he is who he was two seasons ago then they will be fine. The thing is I don’t know if JuJu is that guy or he was that guy because he had Antonio Brown on the other side. I don’t know how anyone would be able to know the answer to that</p>
<p><strong>Seven’s Coming</strong>: Hi PAUL- thanks for the chat! I just read a second article revealing Brady and Edelman had undisclosed injuries for the last half of the season. What’s the difference between this and the Steelers being fined for not disclosing Ben’s? This injury list seems like a joke but then a fine gets handed out? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think it all depends on how they were listed on the injury report. I don’t know the answer to that because I don’t have the injury reports in front of me. We’re they listed as probable? It is a very interesting question</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What is the impact/importance of Ola and Tuzar signing? anything more than cheap backups/insurance? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Two guys with a little bit of potential who are as you said cheap insurance</p>
<p><strong>fredward</strong>: Do you expect the Steelers to prioritize running back or offensive line in the draft? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think offensive line. I can’t see them picking a running back early given that they have 18 of them or so already on the roster</p>
<p><strong>Jim </strong>: I know Dupree played better this year, but can we afford to pay him big dollars and have him revert to his old self? I say go with youth and pay Watt, agree? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I disagree. The Steelers defense is predicated on pressure. I think they have to pay Dupree the money. He is finally an elite pass rusher. That is almost as valuable as a big time QB. And with no first round pick I have a hard time believing they can get a young impact pass rusher in the draft</p>
<p><strong>SevernBob</strong>: Living in the heart of Ravens country, having this discussion w/fans at work. They claim Lamar is a “generational” talent; I tell them to pump the brakes ‘cause he’s only played just over a full season. To me, a generational talent has to put up #s for years to be declared one, what say you? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well he is a “generational talent” but the real question is he a “generational player” and that’s what you are getting at. His talent is special and the kind that only comes around every so often. But now he needs to prove he is an elite level generational player. He needs to do this year after year and he needs to win a few Super Bowls to get into that category!!</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Don't you think the Oline is a scheme rather than personnel issue? It seems these guys were groomed/coached to 'catch' blocks, don't take sacks, backpedal, etc...which kept Ben on his feet a lot, but it takes away any chance at having a great running game. Teams that throw it 50 times/game don't win, but that's what we've got... <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes it is both. I’ve said it all year. The schemes and play calling for the running game are below the line and they had some guys get old. The combination of both was a big problem</p>
<p><strong>DK</strong>: Would you sign JuJu now while his value is probably a bit lower or wait to see if he bounces back next year? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would wait. There is no reason to jump the gun. If he isn’t the guy you can move on from him with no cap implications. If he is you are gonna pay him anyway so you might as well do it anyway</p>
<p><strong>Ken</strong>: What position is the greatest liability for the Steeler's at this time? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would say tight end and quarterback. I mean maybe Ben comes back maybe he is a shell of himself. Until we know that answer it is a liability</p>
<p><strong>jwheaney </strong>: Given Connor's penchant for injury and fumblitis...do you think it is time to move on from him? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: He has one more year on his deal. So they should basically let him play next year and then let him walk. Someone will pay him but with his injury history it shouldn’t be the Steelers</p>
<p><strong>jwheaney </strong>: Do you think Ju Ju is more effective lined up in the slot or as a wide out? Thanks! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well his best season was as a slot guy and the number 2. It is why I say we cannot assume he will just “bounce back” next year as he has not proven he can be the No. 1 and play at an elite level. Thats not to say he can’t but it is to say these assumptions he will are nased <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: based in hope and not reality. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: ok that’s it for me, thanks for all the great questions and we will do it again next Thursday at the same time!!!</p>
