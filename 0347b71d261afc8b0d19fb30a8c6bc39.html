<h1>Point Park moves forward with 'Pippin' preview performance</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Point Park University has magic to do. It has to turn the tables on the cancellation of one show, with the hope that its replacement will heal some of the wounds that led to that drastic step.</p>
<p>And it has to do it in the midst of a health scare that has caused the cancellation of productions across the country and at surrounding universities such as the University of Pittsburgh. In New York, the Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall have canceled performances through March 31, while in San Francisco, where large gatherings have been banned, the “Hamilton” tour is among the canceled shows. However, from Broadway to the Pittsburgh Cultural District, from City Theatre on the South Side to Off the WALL at Carnegie Stage, the shows go on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Thursday, the show was set to for a preview performance, while it was announced that Point Park’s in-person classes would be suspended on Friday —&nbsp;“Pippin’s” opening night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Decisions regarding outside events throughout the university and all scheduled performances at the Pittsburgh Playhouse will be reviewed daily and on a case-by-case basis," a statement from Point Park said. "The university has been in communication with local arts organizations and will continue to follow best practices. The production of 'Pippin' will continue as scheduled."</p>
<p>The statement added that Theatre Department Dean Steven Breese was to meet with the cast and company of "Pippin" prior to the Thursday performance "to discuss future contingencies," and that all school and Playhouse events and performance schedules are subject to change.</p>
<p>“Magic to Do,” appropriately, is the opening number of “Pippin,” the musical chosen to stand in for “Parade,” which was to be a splashy penultimate presentation for the Conservatory of Performing Arts Theatre students.</p>
<p>The Tony Award-winning “Parade,” about a historical lynching in the South, was the victim of bad timing and a lack of roles for a diverse cast. An atmosphere of racial insensitivity described by several students on an earlier canceled production of “The Adding Machine” spilled over, leading to the dismissal of “Parade.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time, before COVID-19 appeared on the scene, worries were for the students who felt victimized, as well as upperclassmen who might miss out on an important onstage or behind-the-scenes showcase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter the tale of Pippin, son of Charlemagne and about whom history tells us little. As a fantasy adventure in which a young man seeks his purpose in life, composer Stephen Schwartz’s first Broadway show has proved malleable since it debuted in 1977. It won four Tonys that year, two for director/choreographer Bob Fosse.</p>
<p>It was a show that could be made over to reflect Point Park’s needs, at a time when it would have been especially hurtful to deny Theatre seniors two shows in a season (a cabaret replaced “The Adding Machine”).</p>
<p>In the aftermath of student revelations and demands, Mr. Breese, less than a year into his new job, and university president Paul Hennigan held town halls with students, faculty and staff members.</p>
<p>A student advisory committee has since been formed to discuss the programming for next season and into the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>“My door is always open; it’s open right now,” Mr. Breese said in a phone interview Monday, the same day a collaboration with Pittsburgh Public Theater was announced. Point Park Theatre students and professional actors will be directed by the Public’s Marya Sea Kaminski in scenes for a multidisciplinary Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performance of Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet,” conducted by Manfred Haneck.</p>
<p>From afar, director Stephen Sposito was kept abreast of “The Adding Machine” fallout.</p>
<p>Mr. Sposito is an associate of Point Park alumnus Rob Ashford, the Tony- and Emmy-winning director who was to helm “Parade.” His behind-the-scenes Broadway work includes Ashford’s shows (“Cat on a Hot Tin Roof”; “Promises, Promises”; “How to Succeed …”) and “The Book of Mormon.”</p>
<p>“I had been out to do auditions for “Parade” in October, had met most of the students and stayed in contact with the student stage manager and assistant director, and I kind of witnessed all of it in real time,” Mr. Sposito said by phone, with “Pippin” rehearsals well underway.</p>
<p>Although he wasn’t here, he listened by audio feed to the town halls and said he understood the need to move on from “Parade.”</p>
<p>“I’m happy [students] voiced their feelings, and they should take control of their education path, with an eye toward where they are emotionally,” Mr. Sposito said. “That’s absolutely valid.”</p>
<p>Still, it’s a shock to the system to prepare for one show and turn on a dime to do another.</p>
<p>When “Pippin” was chosen to fill the “Parade” slot, opening March 13, Mr. Sposito returned to do new auditions and start from scratch.</p>
<p>The show&nbsp;— an often dark coming-of-age fantasy about a young man’s journey to find where in the world he fits&nbsp;— has been reimagined in an awards-show format, in collaboration with Conservatory Dance and Cinema Arts students.</p>
<p>There’s a bit of a “flying by the seat of our pants” element to the production, Mr. Sposito said, because of the contracted time element. “Pippin” was most recently revived on Broadway by “the brilliant” Diane Paulus, in an award-winning production that incorporated acrobatics and other circus elements, but the decision was made at Point Park to come up with a new plan.</p>
<p>“It’s unlike any ‘Pippin’ you’ve seen before,” promised Mr. Breese.</p>
<p>Once a direction was decided upon, Mr. Sposito said, “It was, ‘Now we are doing this, let’s take a stab at it our own way.’ It’s a modern take with a huge video element. The designers have been great and thoroughly engaged.”</p>
<p>In pulling the elements together, “I’m amazed we did it in 10 days, when it usually would be three to four months,” Mr. Sposito said. “But that part of it has been kind of exciting.”</p>
<p>He admits that he hasn’t worked like this&nbsp;— in such a short period of time, with so many people and elements involved&nbsp;— since his college days at the University of Michigan. But marching into the unknown together has been “incredibly unifying,” he said. “You can see people’s brains turn on.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t always sure about how we were going to get there, but I’m happy we powered through and did a show.”</p>
