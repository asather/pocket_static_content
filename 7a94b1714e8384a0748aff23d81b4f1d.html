<h1>Cold shooting dooms Pitt in its fourth-consecutive loss at Syracuse</h1>

<p>SYRACUSE, N.Y. —&nbsp;In recent years, the Carrier Dome, Syracuse’s cavernous 35,000-seat arena, has been where hopes of a promising season go to die for the Pitt men’s basketball program.</p>
<p>It’s unclear where the Panthers’ season will go in their final 11 regular-season games — and whatever may wait beyond that — but they, yet again, left the venue Saturday disappointed and unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Freshman forward Justin Champagnie had a team-high 14 points and eight rebounds, but Pitt was unable to rebound from a putrid first half, one in which it shot just 23.1% overall and 18.2% from 3-point range, in a 69-61 loss against Syracuse.</p>
<p>The loss prevented the Panthers (13-7, 4-5 ACC) from its first three-game win streak in ACC play since the 2015-16 season. It was also their fourth-consecutive loss at the Carrier Dome, though it fell by eight after each of the three prior meetings had been decided by at least 11.</p>
<p>The Orange, for the most part, kept the Panthers outside of striking distance in the game’s final 20 minutes, leading by as many as 16. In the final minutes, however, whatever comfort it may have had, especially in front of a home crowd, vanished.</p>
<p>Leading by eight with the opportunity to build on that advantage, Syracuse’s Quincy Guerrier missed a pair of free throws, only for Ryan Murphy to drain a 3 from the top of the key on the other end for Pitt. After another empty possession for the Orange (13-7, 6-3), a mid-range jumper from Terrell Brown suddenly had the Panthers within a basket, 59-56, with 2:45 to play.</p>
<p>A lob to Champagnie over the Syracuse defense, which was Pitt’s best and most efficient source of offense for much of the second half, got the deficit back to three with 33 seconds remaining, but a heave from Marek Dolezaj to Elijah Hughes on the ensuing inbounds pass got Hughes a dunk, with only Trey McGowens left to try to chase him down.</p>
<p>The Panthers finished the day having shot just 38.9% overall and 23.8% from 3. Brown also finished in double figures, scoring 11 points and pulling down seven rebounds.</p>
<p>Against an opponent who specializes and excels in a defense that has flummoxed Pitt for so much of the season, the kind of matchup in which little could afford to go wrong, the Panthers saw their small margin for error start to disintegrate early.</p>
<p>Champagnie, one of the team’s best players and someone who figured to be used frequently in the high post against Syracuse’s 2-3 zone, was whistled for two fouls in the opening 2:07. Without him, the offense flailed, looking both lost and overpowered.</p>
<p>The Panthers missed 14 of their first 16 shots and missed their first nine 3s, not connecting from deep until 16:46 had elapsed. The Orange, one of the nation’s tallest teams, blocked five of Pitt’s first 11 field goal attempts, a barrage of rejections that had a lingering effect, like when Xavier Johnson, with a seemingly open layup, missed after hoisting it up high off the backboard, perhaps trying to make it unreachable. At one point in the half, Buddy Boeheim, Syracuse’s standout sophomore and the son of legendary Orange coach Jim Boeheim, had single-handedly doubled Pitt’s point total, 18-9.</p>
<p>As all that unfolded, the Panthers fell behind by as many as 20, 30-10. Champagnie re-entered the game shortly thereafter, with 5:49 left in the first half, and whether it was his presence or a team simply getting more comfortable against the zone, Pitt sliced into its deficit, outscoring the Orange, 11-4, the rest of the half to go trail by only 11, 32-21, at the break.</p>
<p>Halftime scores can be framed in any number of ways, both to give a team reason for optimism and dread. In the case of Saturday’s game, Hughes and Joe Girard III — two of Syracuse’s top three scorers this season, combining to average 31.9 points per game — had just two points at half, going a combined one of nine from the field. Yet, despite that, their team still led by 11.</p>
<p>Pitt returns to action Tuesday with a game at Duke, which will mark coach Jeff Capel’s first time coaching as an opponent at the school where he played for four years and coached for another seven.</p>
