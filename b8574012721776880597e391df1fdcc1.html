<h1>Source: Pirates first-round pick Nick Gonzales expected to sign</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>First-round pick Nick Gonzales will take a physical Wednesday at PNC Park with the intent of signing a contract, a source told the Post-Gazette on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Pirates drafted Gonzales No. 7 overall out of New Mexico State on June 10. The middle infielder is expected to sign for the slot value assigned to that pick, which is $5,432,400.</p>
<p>That Gonzales plans on signing is not a surprise. He’s known for being obsessed with baseball and ready to start playing it at the highest level.</p>
<p>As a junior, before the college baseball season was disrupted by the novel coronavirus pandemic, Gonzales ranked first in the NCAA in home runs (12), runs scored (28), RBIs (36) and total bases (67).</p>
<p>As a sophomore, Gonzales led the national in batting average (.432) and was named an All-American by six different publications.</p>
<p>Gonzales actually began his career at New Mexico State as a walk-on, adding weight as a freshman and overhauling his approach at the plate to develop into the hitter that is he now — one with quick hands and significantly more pop than you might expect from someone who’s 5-foot-10, 190 pounds.</p>
