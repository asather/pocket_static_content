<h1>Former Aliquippa police chief sues over removal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The former police chief in Aliquippa has sued the city in federal court, saying he was removed without cause or an opportunity to defend himself in violation of the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>Don Couch says he was improperly placed on administrative leave in June 2018 without being told why.</p>
<p>His is the latest in a series of suits embroiling the city of Aliquippa and its police department.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the former assistant chief, Joseph Perciavalle III, sued the city and its top officials, including Officer Couch, saying they conspired with the Beaver County district attorney to prosecute him in retaliation for reporting wrongdoing by Couch and other misconduct in the department.</p>
<p>A former sergeant demoted to patrolman, Kenneth Watkins, has also sued the district attorney and the mayor in a related matter.</p>
<p>Officer Couch's suit says he exhibited the "highest level of competence and integrity" since he became an officer in 1997. He was promoted to chief in 2014. City Council placed him on paid administrative leave on June 6, 2018.</p>
<p>The suit says everyone at the council meeting appeared to know he was going to be placed on leave except him. He said Officer Perciavalle went home that day, allegedly sick, but returned in uniform an hour before the council meeting. Officer Perciavalle then told a sergeant and two other officers to accompany him to the council meeting, where they escorted Officer Couch from the building.</p>
<p>Officer Perciavalle briefly became the acting chief until his own removal following his arrest two days later, although all of the charges were later dismissed by a judge or dropped by the district attorney.</p>
<p>Officer Couch and his lawyer, Colleen Ramage Johnston, said he did not learn why he was removed until January 2019, when an Aliquippa resident told him that an Aliquippa council member had said the suspension was for "stealing." The complaint says nothing more about the allegation.</p>
<p>Officer Couch said at no time has the city issued any feedback or discipline about his performance.</p>
<p>The suit says he was denied due process and that the city's actions have humiliated him and deprived him of his ability to be a police chief.</p>
<p>He is asking to be reinstated as chief or to be compensated for his lost pay and benefits. He is also asking for damages for his emotional distress.</p>
<p>Aliquippa officials will not comment on any litigation.</p>
