<h1>Bad Custer rides hard -- with a drunken horse -- on second album </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Let’s take a moment to bow our heads and reflect upon all the concept albums that never saw the light of day.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps, you could celebrate — up to you! — but if you’re in a band, at some point, you probably talked about your “Wall,” your “Quadrophenia” or “American Idiot” and, in the end said, “Nah, that’s crazy.”</p>
<p>That’s what Bad Custer did in making a second full-length album, with the self-deprecating title “Bad Custer Needs Work.” It began with a song called “Mr. Buttercup,” which ended up not making the final cut.</p>
<p>As frontman Jesse Davis explains, “Mr. Buttercup” “is about a horse that likes to drink a little too much and ends up crashing his carriage while traveling through the woods on Christmas with Tiny Man in tow.”</p>
<p>OK. And how tiny was Tiny Man?</p>
<p>So tiny, Davis says, that Tiny Man “could fit in your pocket.” The idea came to the prolific songwriter while he was attempting to make his bandmates laugh during the tracking of a song with no lyrics.</p>
<p>“We eventually then came up with different characters, like the evil Great Tall Guy and a few companions Tiny Man and Buttercup would meet on their journey, like the crustacean man, Genghis Prawn.</p>
<p>“It was a bit of a joke, and then turned into us pretty much poking fun at huge, bloated concept albums, which we all kind of love.”</p>
<p>Some of the remnants remain on “Bad Custer Needs Work,” an exuberant new album that ranges from garage-rock to scratch-funk to grungy Americana.</p>
<p>Bad Custer, formed in Allison Park, goes back to 2005 when Davis and bassist Phil Giammattei started playing together as young teens. Members came in and out and moved around a bit over the next decade and then circled back for the current lineup, with drummer Jake Leya and Giammattei’s brother Kurt on keyboards.</p>

<p>“When we started the band,” Davis says, “I had this vision to be like a Galaxie 500/Luna-kind of, Velvet Underground-style thing. But I grew up with bluegrass — my dad playing in bluegrass bands and stuff — so I guess all that kind of took over and we just ended up playing music that we normally play anyway, without trying to sound like anyone else.”</p>
<p>Bad Custer debuted in 2015 with an EP recorded at Liveburgh Studio, run by Chris Leya (Jake’s dad) and followed that three years later with a self-titled, full-length album recorded at Broadcast Lane.</p>
<p>“That album took a long time,” Davis says, “because we did a lot of individual tracks over one another. The nice part about this new album is that we tracked everything in a weekend with Jake Hanner [of Donora] and then spent six more sessions doing overdubs and that was it. It was pretty quick, in and out, it was great.”</p>
<p>The concept album fell by the wayside, in part, because they wanted it all to fit on a vinyl release.</p>
<p>Davis, who says he treasures the gravelly singers like Tom Waits and Bob Dylan, turns in some powerful vocal performances on songs like the soaring ballad “I Still Love You” and the moody psych-rocker “No One Knows.”</p>
<p>“Outside, Texas,” Davis says, “is a series of metaphors that all kind of merge into each other and I think I'm by far most proud of that one. I was listening to a lot of Car Seat Headrest when I wrote that.”</p>
<p>Gazing at the tracklist, people might be tempted to jump to the provocatively titled “The Ballad of Jesus Christ,” which closes the album with wild abandon. It begins with Davis howling, “My name is...Jesus Christ!/I ain’t no son of God/but the sentiment’s nice!”</p>
<p>“We had this kind of roots-rock riff that we were playing around with and we liked to jam on,” Davis explains, “but I really didn't have any ideas for lyrics and I thought it'd be fun to write a song about Jesus, who actually isn't the son of God but is just like this insolent teenager who hates Joseph because it's not his real dad. Yeah, just this kind of like Jesus as just a normal guy.”</p>
<p>Midway through the record comes “Outlaw,” which eases in at a relaxed country pace before becoming a galloping rocker with a few surprise guests.</p>
<p>“ ‘Outlaw’ was fun because it’s supposed to be a cowboy love song,” Davis says, “but then Mr. Buttercup and Tiny Man ‘crash’ the cowboy’s song in the third verse, showing up unexpectedly to rob everyone and then take their leave to show up again later in the album. We were trying to break the fourth wall, musically, in a way, and laugh at the self-seriousness of a lot of high-concept, rock ’n’ roll and its ridiculous storytelling.”</p>
<p>That said, don’t be surprised if Bad Custer resurfaces down the road with a concept record, maybe even featuring that horse with a name.</p>
<p><em>The band planned to release “Bad Custer Needs Work” on Friday with a show at Mr. Smalls Funhouse. Instead, Bad Custer will be on YouTube at 8 p.m. Friday from Liveburgh Studio, Glenshaw, with a live stream concert that will benefit “community bail funds, mutual aid organizations, and racial justice organizers.”</em></p>
