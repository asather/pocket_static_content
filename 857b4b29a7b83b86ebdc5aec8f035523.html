<h1>Pitt continues recruiting surge with graduate transfer, three 2021 commits</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt addressed its future up front in a notable way and added a defensive prospect while continuing its recent recruiting surge this weekend.</p>
<p>Keldrick Wilson, an immediately eligible graduate transfer offensive tackle from Hampton, committed to Pitt on Saturday night. And on Sunday afternoon, three prospects — offensive tackles Terrence Enos and Brandon Honorable, as well as linebacker Preston Lavant — joined the Panthers' 2021 class.</p>
<p>"It feels good to be a Pitt Panther, knowing that I'm part of that group," Honorable told the Post-Gazette. "I talked to [Enos] last night and told him that it would be dope to go to the same school. And he's like, 'Yeah, let's make this happen.'"</p>
<p>Pitt's 2021 class is now firmly in the top 25 nationally, according to both Rivals.com and 247 Sports. It's still early May, so there's time for Pitt to add more pieces and other programs to fill their slots. But this group has a good chance to finish as Pat Narduzzi's highest-rated recruiting class, a title currently held by the 2016 class (29th on Rivals, 30th on 247).</p>
<p>Pitt's recruiting run — nine 2021 verbal commits since April 22 — is a positive sign, especially in a time when in-home and on-campus visits are prohibited. Pitt's coaching staff is expanding its footprint without leaving the city, with eight of Pitt's 12 commits in 2021 hailing from different states.</p>
<p>Lavant, a three-star outside linebacker with offers from Cincinnati, Louisville, West Virginia and Nebraska, is from Georgia. Both Enos and Honorable are three-star prospects from Detroit. Enos, a 6-5, 314-pounder, was offered by LSU, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, West Virginia and 21 other programs. And Honorable, a 6-6, 270-pounder, had offers from 16 schools, including Michigan State, Minnesota, Syracuse and Tennessee.</p>
<p>While Archie Collins coaches defensive backs at Pitt, the Detroit native and Michigan State graduate was instrumental in securing the commitments of Enos and Honorable. Collins is a Cass Tech alumnus, where Enos currently stars. Honorable added that Collins is the only college coach he's met during the recruiting process who's from Detroit.</p>
<p>"We really had a connection before we actually met. You know what I'm saying? That really stood out to me," Honorable said. "He came up to the school multiple times. The relationship with him is very good."</p>
<p>There's a budding relationship between Honorable and Enos, too, who play for rival schools. Honorable stars at Martin Luther King High School, the alma mater of former Pitt corner Avonte Maddox.</p>
<p>"When you think of football in Detroit, it's King or Cass," Honorable said. The lineman hopes he and Enos can one day start together on opposite sides of the line at Pitt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the short-term, Wilson chose to spend 2020, his final year of eligibility, at Pitt over USC, West Virginia and Indiana. The 6-6, 305-pound blocker from North Carolina saw limited action at Hampton in his first three years, but he started last season and now has a chance to do the same with the Panthers.</p>
<p>Pitt's offensive line is basically set for next season. Jimmy Morrissey will lead the line at center, while Carter Warren, Bryce Hargrove and Jake Kradel return at left tackle, left guard and right guard, respectively. Right tackle, though, is a job up for grabs, with Gabe Houy, Carson Van Lynn and now Wilson competing for time.</p>
<p>Nolan Ulizio, a grad transfer from Michigan, spent his last year starting at right tackle for Pitt in 2019, so it's not unprecedented for the Panthers to have a tackle come in and secure the role.</p>
<p>Wilson's decision not only gives Pitt a possible starting tackle in 2020, but it also brings the Panthers' scholarship total to 85. Barring any further roster attrition, they won't be able to bring in any new players ahead of the campaign, whenever that may start.</p>
