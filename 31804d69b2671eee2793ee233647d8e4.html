<h1>Trump criticizes Dr. Birx over virus remarks </h1>

<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said White House coronavirus task force leader Dr. Deborah Birx hurt the Trump administration when she said widespread virus infections in urban and rural America mark a “new phase” for the pandemic.</p>
<p>It was a rare rebuke of Dr. Birx. Trump accused her of taking “the bait” by responding to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who told ABC’s “This Week” that she had lost confidence in Dr. Birx because Trump appointed her and the president has been spreading disinformation about the virus.</p>
<p>Trump, in a tweet Monday, described Dr. Birx’s response to Pelosi as “pathetic.”</p>
<p>On CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, Dr. Birx said her comments are driven by data and that she would stake her 40-year career on using data to implement programs to save lives.</p>
<p>She said the “new phase” of the coronavirus pandemic is much more extensive than the spring outbreaks in major cities like New York and Seattle.</p>
<p>She recommended that people living in communities where cases are surging consider wearing a mask at home if they live with someone who is especially vulnerable because of age or underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>“What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread,” Dr. Birx said, adding that rural areas have not been spared. “So everybody who lives in a rural area, you are not immune.”</p>
<p>She emphasized the significance of asymptomatic transmission. “If you have an outbreak in your rural area or in your city, you need to really consider wearing a mask at home, assuming that you’re positive if you have individuals in your household with co-morbidities,” she said.</p>
<p>Both she and Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, emphasized the importance of mask wearing, hand washing and avoiding crowds. On the NBC program “Meet the Press,” Admiral Giroir said some of the efforts seemed to be helping in recent weeks to reduce the number of cases in Arizona and some other states that have been hard hit this summer.</p>
<p>He repeatedly returned to mask wearing as perhaps the most effective preventive measure in communities experiencing an outbreak. “Wearing a mask is incredibly important, but we have to have like 85 or 90 percent of individuals wearing a mask and avoiding crowds,” he said. Those percentages, he said, give “you the same outcome as a complete shutdown.”</p>
