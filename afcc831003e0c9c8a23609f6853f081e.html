<h1>Virus closes national forest for most activities</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny National Forest has been ordered closed due to public health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The emergency closure order, issued by ANF Supervisor Jamie Davidson this week, prohibits all fires, overnight camping, and groups larger than 10 people, and shuts down all developed campgrounds, backcountry camping, cabins, restrooms and other visitor facilities in the 500,000-acre forest located 120 miles north of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Recreational activities not affected by the order include trail hiking and backpacking, and fishing, kayaking and canoeing on the Allegheny Reservoir and Allegheny and Clarion rivers.</p>
<p>“I did not make this decision lightly,” said Ms. Davidson. “As we work through an unpredictable and rapidly changing situation, health and safety is our number one priority. We are proactive in aligning with Gov. Wolf’s executive stay-at-home order and will continue to fulfill our mission to minimize the impacts and spread of COVID-19.”</p>
<p>According to a Wednesday news release, the closure decision by Ms. Davidson, who took over as ANF supervisor in September, is consistent with current federal, state and local guidance for social distancing and was taken to ensure the health and safety of forest employees, visitors, and volunteers.</p>
<p>The closures and use restrictions will remain in effect at the state’s only national forest until withdrawn by the supervisor.</p>
<p>To protect public health and safety, the forest service urged ANF visitors to avoid crowded areas, clean up after pets, carry out all trash and avoid activities that risk injury because there is limited forest service staffing to provide assistance.</p>
<p>The state’s forests and park facilities, including park and forest offices, visitor centers, restrooms and campgrounds are also closed to the public through April 30, and public events, programs and training sessions are cancelled. As in the ANF, “passive and dispersed recreation” such as hiking, fishing and water sports like canoeing and kayaking are permitted.</p>
