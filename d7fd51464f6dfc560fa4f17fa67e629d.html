<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 03.04.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi folks. Welcome to my weekly Pirates chat. We’ll get started around noon, but you can ask your questions right here, right now. Thanks! -- Mackey</p>
<p><strong>Blackhawk Bob</strong>: Do you think it would be a better idea to send Cole Tucker to AAA to play daily than to keep him in the big leagues as a utility player ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: And it’s eight, and it’s seven, and it’s six, five, four ... and away, we go ... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi, Bob. I do think that, yes. I would rather see the Pirates allow Tucker to play every day in the minor leagues than only twice a week in the majors. He’s still developing. He needs innings. That’s why you have guys like Heredia, Gonzalez, Osuna and Riddle -- to fill those spots.</p>
<p><strong>Dean</strong>: Xtra roster spot will it go to a pitcher or extra bench guy or still too early to say? Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi, Dean. I expect them to go with 13 position players and eight pitchers.</p>
<p><strong>Thomastown</strong>: In looking at reasons to be optimistic about this season, you have mentioned how bad things (attitude, management, etc.) got last season. I don’t remember you guys reporting on that at the time. Did I miss that or were you trying to not be too negative while the previous management team was in place? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I thought we did cover the overall mood of the clubhouse and around the team; however, I do think that only a certain amount of that stuff can be observed live. I think it’s come out more because guys have since been more comfortable talking what they were feeling and thinking at the time.</p>
<p><strong>stuckinnj</strong>: I just read Starkey’s article about the contracts the Pirates have (haven’t) given out in 20 years. PNC Park is without a doubt the greatest baseball stadium in baseball, but is it time to label it the park ‘built on lies’? No owner has lived up to what was promised when it was built. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I just read Starkey’s column as well. Tremendous, per Joe’s usual. ... I’m not ready to label the entire building “Built on Lie” or anything else like that, but I do think fans deserve better than what they’ve gotten out of PNC Park -- meaning more competitive baseball. I also think the Pirates should be spending more than they are now. Thirdly, I think they should do whatever they have to do to keep Josh Bell here long term -- aside from like $45 million a year, if that’s what he wants or something else crazy. And if the Pirates can’t ever spend at the league average, ask yourself, what are we doing here? Because there are people who would buy this team in an instant -- I don’t know, Lemieux/Burkle, Keaton or Tull; plus, I’m not convinced Mark Cuban would truly abstain -- if Nutting ever decided to sell. That being said, I do see where they’re at now. They need to figure out what they have before they start spending again. But once they do, then I really hope Nutting is willing to support the people ... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: ... he hired and be fair to the fans by at least somewhat near the MLB average.</p>
<p><strong>Ron J</strong>: Hi Jason . I say if the Pirates don’t loose 100 games it would be great year . <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Ron. I don’t think they’ll lose 100 games. I really don’t. I honest to God think they’ll flirt with .500. We need to be mindful of how bad things got in 2019, how checked out everyone was. Also how woefully behind the times the Pirates were when it came to their pitching plan and how bad they were with fundamentals.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Jason, do you get to go on the San Fran/Denver trip in June? I think you’ve earned it. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Ha. Indeed I do. And I can’t wait. Have been to both, but always for hockey, never baseball. San Francisco is very likely my favorite place on Earth. The only other place close is Vancouver.</p>

<p><strong>David</strong>: Hi Jason. Are there still plenty of good seats/sections available for opening day? Any insight on how season ticket sales have fared this year? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: HI David, I did a quickie search, and yeah, there are plenty of solid options available. However, I don’t have enough hard data at the moment -- this year compared to any sort of trend over the past couple -- to give you the answer you’re looking for. But the team won 69 games last year. They haven’t been to the playoffs since ‘15 and have been over .500 only once since then. It’s also the beginning of March. Seeing available seats right now doesn’t set off alarm bells for me.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff M</strong>: If the Bucs adopt the Twins swing for the fences approach form last year, do you see any particular Pirate that may benefit from that approach? I feel like Moran could have some success with that approach. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Jeff. He would be my pick, too. I don’t know if it’s something as drastic as swinging for the fences. I do think they paid more attention to launch angle, and they also freed their hitters up to think less. But as far as untapped power potential? I see Moran fitting in that category. I also think Reynolds could hit more home runs than he did, and I think Kevin Newman has additional power in there, too.</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: When, if actuallyever, Gonzalez is healthy do the Bucs keep both he and Riddle? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I could see that. I like what I’ve seen from Riddle thus far. I’d have a tough time -- again, at this point -- seeing him not make the club. But I think Gonzalez is probably a better backup third baseman until Ke’Bryan Hayes is ready. Also, I think it would probably make more sense to use him in the outfield if there’s an injury. ... That said, I wanna see Tucker, Hayes, Craig, Martin and Oliva get shots. (I think Cruz is too raw.) If Gonzalez is blocking one of them, then they need to make a move, because they need young guys to get reps.</p>
<p><strong>Dingo</strong>: What do the pirates see in Yacksel Rios? He is on the 40 man. His stats look terrible <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: My guess is they probably see a Triple-A pitcher for a team that’s trying to improve.. There’s no crime there. Not everyone on the 40-man can be a stud. If he’s in high-leverage situations for the major league club, then we have issues.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri</strong>: Any chance of Nutting being shamed into spending more money in light of the Brewers extending their superstar? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: If Nutting hasn’t reacted to fan sentiment by now regarding how much the Pirates spend, I don’t see it happening because of Christian Yelich.</p>
<p><strong>David</strong>: Haven’t the Pirates conditioned us to believe that the contract Yelich just received from the Brewers wasn’t possible for “small market” teams? What gives? Or, is it possible we’ve all been marks? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I’m not going to answer for the entire fan base, but that type of contract should be possible. In my opinion, you start out like the Pirates are now ... win a little, spend a little ... win a little, spend a little ... win a little, spend a little ... people keep going to games, team keeps winning, they keep trying to do more and more. Sooner or later you’re able to sign a franchise player. Doesn’t mean you buy six of ‘em, but you should be able to keep your best guys.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Jason, in a previous response, you mentioned “...how bad things got in 2019, how checked out everyone was...” etc. Funny, like most of your readers, I don’t remember you mentioning any of that last year? Like the Pirates, your credibility is questionable? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Matt. If you’re going to call my credibility into question -- which is the most important thing we have as reporters -- I would hope you could do it with more than “I don’t remember you ... “ ... I did mention it here and in my writing. Did I make as big of a deal about it as now? No, I didn’t. Because I didn’t know. And I didn’t learn until things changed, and guys were willing to share more about everything players endured. We only see so much. What we saw was rotten. We also heard some things. But it takes time for the more complete story to come out. It’s not because I thought I was pulling some sort of trick on you guys.</p>
<p><strong>Dean</strong>: I get the “Pirates should spend more” crowd but usually amount spent on the major league roster falls in line with teams ranked with revenue. You can’t compare a Milwaukee to Pittsburgh because we don’t know how much more revenue - media deals, parking, concession and higher ticket prices out paces what the Pirates bring in. Hope this makes sense <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I’m not particularly interested in comparing Milwaukee to Pittsburgh. I’ve gotten asked a couple questions from people looking to compare Milwaukee to Pittsburgh, and I’ve tried to answer them to the best of my ability. ... It’s fair for Pirates fans to want the club to spend more than $51 million on major league players. I think we could probably debate how much more, but I have no issue saying I think there payroll should be higher than it is.</p>
<p><strong>Dingo</strong>: I am high on Blake cederlind. He has kind of flown under the radar on the prospect list. What are your thoughts on this young man? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I like him a lot, and I agree that he has kind of flown under the radar. Part of it was how suddenly he’s come in. Since learning his sinker last season, he’s turned into a different sort of pitcher. I’ll be curious to see what he does this season with his cutter and changeup -- whether he’s able to refine that stuff enough to make the big leagues. He’s certainly close. Definitely fun to watch.</p>

<p><strong>Gus M</strong>: Hi Jason I have enjoyed all of your stuff on the Pirates. I am here on Anna Marie Island and will go to 6 or 7 games and the season opener in Tampa. I am 72 and baseball is the only sport. Things are really bad now with the team and things like this have happen before we are lucky we have a hometown team. People have the choice to go to games or watch games on TV I will be there because I want the Pirates to stay here and I like to watch the games even if they do <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: That’s great, Gus. Thanks for sharing and hanging out in our Pirates chat. I’ll be back to your neck of the woods on Saturday. Can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Jason...Any candidates to surprisingly make the team coming north? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t think so. Derek Holland is the only one I can think of. I don’t see Cruz, Cederlind, Oliva or any other young guys making it. I think Kuhl starts in Triple-A.</p>
<p><strong>Dingo</strong>: Do you think Derek Shelton will employ the Clint hurdle approach of giving guys numerous days off throughout the season? Hurdle liked to give the guys back to back days off. I am glad those guys got the rest, it sure paid dividends in the playoffs. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Good one, Dingo. That wasn’t a Hurdle thing, although he was pretty liberal with it. ... I don’t think Shelton will be as liberal. I think he’s probably going to be more old school with that stuff, but you are going to see guys get more days off than they did decades ago just because the game is different.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Tell Matt from LA to shut up <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: He’s entitled to his opinion, but I don’t think my credibility is damaged because of how I have or haven’t covered what he’s talking about.</p>
<p><strong>RPK</strong>: Spring training ERAs are awful. How will they improve when facing starters on a regular basis? Not too optimistic here! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It’s spring training, RPK. Take it with a grain of salt. They’re only pitching one or two innings and working on stuff. They certainly need to pitch better than they have, but it’s not yet time to panic.</p>
<p><strong>Dingo</strong>: Any Extra precautions being taken with the pirates in regards to the corona virus ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They sanitized LECOM Park yesterday, an off-day. Here’s my story on it: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/03/04/Pirates-sanitize-spring-training-facility-on-off-day-covid-19-coronavirus/stories/202003040104" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/03/04/Pirates-sanitiz...</a></p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: If Burdi can stay healthy does he have the “makeup” to be a closer one day? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think so. He throws 100. Solid breaking stuff. I like his makeup. The question with Burdi has been, and will always be, what you asked: Can he stay healthy? He’s been tremendously injury-prone, but stuff-wise, he’s absolutely closer material.</p>
<p><strong>Sammy</strong>: More likely than not that Gonzalez/Archer open up on IL, or too early to tell? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t think so. I think both will be ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Will Cruz start in AAA if he keeps doing well in spring training? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t think so, in part because of Cole Tucker. If things continue the way they are now, I would expect Tucker to start in Triple-A so he’s able to play every day. That means Cruz doesn’t have any opportunities there. I think Cruz stays in Double-A. I don’t think that’s a bad thing, either. He needs to iron out the consistency part of his game. Because as many times as he’s looked great, he’s also experienced some hiccups as well.</p>
<p><strong>Dean</strong>: Have you seen the guys we got in the Marte trade? Any early impressions? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I have not seen them, no. I think they were scheduled to arrive after we went over to LECOM. I came back up north on Saturday. Should probably swing by Pirate City and see ‘em whenever I get back, though.</p>
<p><strong>Mike from SouthSide</strong>: Any chance they will try to get Moran to hit against the shift and take the easy single instead of forcing us to continue to watch him making outs? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They’ve been working with Moran on his opposite-power, so, in a way, yeah. But I don’t think he should worry specifically about being shifts. I think he needs to be better hitting the ball to all fields, which is what they’re emphasizing with him.</p>
<p><strong>Mike from SouthSide</strong>: Is Archer this season’s Chisenhall? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t think so. It’s neck soreness in February (when it was diagnosed). That’s a long leap to go from that to Lonnie Chisenhall.</p>
<p><strong>David</strong>: Would you rather see an Orlando Merced or a Denny Neagle bobble head night this year? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yikes. Are those my only two choices? Can’t get a Joe Randa or Ed Sprague thrown in there? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, everyone. That’ll do it for this week. Looks like we’re out of questions, so I’m gonna start into a feature I’ve been meaning to write. Thanks, as always, for participating. Until next week ...</p>
