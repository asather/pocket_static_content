<h1>Penguins still in the running for No. 1 pick after NHL's draft lottery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Should the Penguins lose in the qualifying round of the NHL’s expanded 24-team postseason tournament, there’s a chance – 12.5% to be exact – it could come with a nice consolation prize: The No. 1 overall pick in the draft.</p>
<p>On Friday evening, the NHL held a modified draft lottery. The weighted draw included the seven clubs who failed to qualify for the tournament, plus eight placeholders for teams that will get eliminated in the opening round.</p>
<p>When it came time to flip over the card for the No. 1 draft slot, the league revealed only an NHL logo – a sign that a placeholder team had won the NHL’s draft lottery. There was a 24.5% chance of this outcome.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Kings will pick No. 2 overall. The Ottawa Senators hold the No. 3 pick thanks to a trade with the San Jose Sharks. Detroit, Ottawa, Anaheim and Buffalo round out the top eight picks.</p>
<p>Because a placeholder team won the draft lottery, the NHL will hold what it’s calling “Phase 2” of the draft lottery following the qualifying round. All eight teams that exit the postseason early will have the same exact 12.5% odds of securing the top pick.</p>
<p>The Penguins have been lucky before when it comes to franchise-changing No. 1 overall picks, landing Mario Lemieux in 1984 and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/04/02/sidney-crosby-2005-nhl-draft-lottery-penguins-15-years-later/stories/202004050011" target="_blank">Sidney Crosby 15 years ago.</a></p>
<p>Alexis Lafreniere is considered the consensus No. 1 overall pick. The two-time CHL Player of the Year played his junior hockey with Rimouski Océanic of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, the same club where Crosby played his junior hockey.</p>
<p>Now, before you go out and buy a Lafreniere jersey, pump the brakes for one second. The No. 5 seeded Penguins are heavy favorites against No. 12 Montreal in the qualifying round. Should the Penguins advance into the round of 16, their 2020 draft board will change considerably.</p>
<p>Minnesota will receive the Penguins’ first-round pick in 2020 if Pittsburgh is outside of the draft lottery, as stipulated in the Jason Zucker trade. The Penguins only have the choice to delay that pick to 2021 if they fail to qualify for the round of 16 teams.</p>
<p>So if the Penguins make it out of the qualifying round, they won’t be scheduled to pick until the third round. Vegas owns their second-round pick, as part of the compensation for selecting Marc-Andre Fleury in the expansion draft.</p>
<p>Of course, the Penguins probably wouldn’t mind shooting for a much shinier prize – one you can drink out of – while the other eight teams who exited the tournament early will be focused on bouncing balls and percentage points.</p>
<p>The draft lottery represented just the first step in the NHL’s return-to-play plan. The NHL and the NHL Players Association have already agreed upon a 24-team format. Players are currently in Phase 2, during which players have been participating in voluntary workouts in small groups.</p>
<p>The NHL plans to move into Phase 3, which is a formal training camp, on July 10. No date has been set for when games will officially resume. It's also important to note that the players have also only agreed to the postseason format, so they will need to iron out more details at the negotiating table.</p>
<p>The NHL has also yet to announce its hub cities. However, Pittsburgh has been crossed off the initial list of 10 finalists.</p>
<p>The results of the draft lottery were the most chaotic of possibilities. But, if nothing else, it will have the sports world talking about hockey during this dry spell for a sports-crazed society.</p>
