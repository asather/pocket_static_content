<h1>Valentine’s egg delivered by Pittsburgh eagles</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At 6:30 p.m. on Valentine's Eve, the ultimate act of avian love was witnessed by live-streaming webcam watchers when the bald eagles of Hays delivered the first egg of 2020.</p>
<p>The white egg is visible in the center of the nest when the adult birds stand, as seen in live video posted on the website of Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania at aswp.org.</p>
<p>"We are hopeful for another successful year for this eagle pair, which has become very popular both in Pittsburgh and across the world,” said Jim Bonner, executive director of the Audubon chapter.</p>

<p>One or two additional eggs are expected, typically with a span of two to three days between them. With an egg in the nest, one of the adults will remain on the nest at all times, warming the egg with its body to protect and incubate it. Often when the caretaker bird stands, it will roll the egg to maintain a consistent temperature. The other adult will make frequent food runs, and the parents will occasionally switch roles.</p>
<p>Since the pair settled on a hillside overlooking the Monongahela River in Hays, they’ve occupied four trees, delivered 16 eggs and fledged 10 juvenile eagles.</p>
<p>A new live-streaming camera system, installed in December 2019, is expected to improve the viewing experience this year.</p>
<p>“We have upgraded the quality of the camera stream to 1080P resolution and viewers can expect a very sharp picture of the nest this year,” said Bill Powers of Monroeville-based CSE Corporation, “We also have more volunteers moving the camera and capturing video clips so that our viewers won’t miss any of the action this season.”</p>
<p>The wildlife camera operates in partnership with CSE, which designs, develops and manufactures safety products including live-streaming cameras for underground mining and other industrial applications. The webcam is a collaborative project linking CSE, Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania and 2020 sponsors Arborel Tree Service and JASE Construction Services.</p>
<p>The project was authorized for educational purposes by the Pennsylvania Game Commission. A downloadable lesson plan developed by Audubon enables teachers and students worldwide to learn about the eagle family and monitor them live from their classrooms. For details, contact Rachel Handel — the Audubon chapter’s communication director — at 412-337-1989 or rhandel@aswp.org.</p>
<p>The Hays eagles were the second pair known to be nesting in Allegheny County. Today, five active eagle nests have been confirmed. Last year, eagles in Harmar that had been monitored since 2015 moved their nest to a steep escarpment off-camera. It will not be monitored again this year -- Audubon officials determined the location is too dangerous to access.</p>
<p>There is also no camera on eagles nesting in North Park, but the nest is visible at a binocular-friendly distance from the North Dakota Pavilion. Additional eagle nests are active on private properties in Glassport and Crescent, site of the first eagle nest noted in Allegheny County in modern times.</p>
