<h1>Allegheny County reports increase in opioid overdose deaths</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County’s medical examiner reported Friday that&nbsp;564 people died in 2019 from a drug overdose, an increase of 72 deaths from 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overdose deaths had dropped in 2018 from the year before, prompting some to hope they had reached a peak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most fatal overdose cases have a common mixture of heroin, fentanyl, and cocaine, according to Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Karl Williams. Fentanyl remains the most common drug found in these cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The pattern of drugs seen in the county’s overdose deaths has remained consistent since 2016, when fentanyl surpassed heroin and became the most common agent found in the mixture of drugs causing the overdose,” Mr. Williams said in a press release.</p>
<p>The data from 2019 also indicates that a majority of the deaths were males (66%), with a majority of males identifying as white (81%)&nbsp;Most of the cases also fell into three age groups: 25-34, 35-44, and 45-54.</p>
<p>Dr. Donald Burke, dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health and associate vice chancellor for global health, said he’s disappointed but not surprised by the 2019 report.&nbsp;Mr. Burke is the senior author in a 2018 paper published in Science Magazine that showed the drug overdose death epidemic in the United States had been growing on an “almost perfect” exponential curve in the past 40 years – with an increase of 8% each year.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear this. I’m disappointed, I had hoped it would be better but we made these projections based on statistical evidence and it was pretty convincing,” Dr. Burke said. “We have to do something different in this country.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a combination of driving factors that influence the increase in overdose deaths, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The epidemic has a lot of drivers that go deep into society. It’s a combination of the persons who are susceptible to drug use because of unemployment, because of the sense of despair in many parts of our country and that in itself has a contagion to it,” Dr. Burke said. “That the attitudes of drugs affect other people and become more widely used. And the consequences of drug sellers exploit the markets.”</p>
<p>The data also tells Mr. Burke that efforts to end the epidemic are not over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We still have our work cut out for us, and we’ve got to continue the efforts of narcan distribution, we have to continue the efforts to providing treatment, and we still haven’t begun to address the problem with enough vigor to really change the curve,” Dr. Burke said.&nbsp;“I have no reason to believe it’s going to get better unless something dramatic happens.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now that the world is in the middle of a pandemic, where most places were under stay-at-home orders for months, leaving people isolated, unemployed and stressed, Dr. Burke said he doesn’t doubt there will be an increase of overdose deaths for 2020. However, he can’t confirm there will be an overwhelming surge in overdoses for this year – yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s anecdotal evidence saying that [an increase of deaths] is happening, but I haven’t seen convincing data that that’s the case,” he said.&nbsp;“But I wouldn’t be surprised. There’s just not solid evidence yet.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Areas with the most overdose deaths in the county include ZIP codes&nbsp;15210 (Hilltop neighborhoods and Carrick), 15235 (Penn Hills and some surrounding areas), and 15212 (North Side).&nbsp;&nbsp;The data collected for this report will be helpful in&nbsp;identifying “priority communities and/or populations that are at risk for overdose,” according to Dr. Debra Bogen, the director of the&nbsp;Allegheny County Health Department.</p>
<p>Since 2015, the county said the Health Department has distributed 22,222 kits on naloxone to revive people and held 165 trainings that equipped around 7,000 people in the county to administer naxolone in an emergency.&nbsp;</p>
