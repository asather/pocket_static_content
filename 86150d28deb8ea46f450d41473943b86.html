<h1>Billy Porter seen and heard on Sunday's 'Rosie O'Donnell Show' and 'The Simpsons'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Billy Porter could be seen and heard helping Rosie O'Donnell raise $500K for The Actors Fund on Sunday night, in a one-night-only star-studded livestream. He also could be heard, but not seen, on TV, too.</p>
<p>The latter was on an episode of "The Simpsons," when Marge and Homer got jobs at competing cannabis businesses. Porter — the Tony, Grammy and Emmy-winning Pittsburgh native, played "crisply funny" store manager Desmond in the episode of the Fox animated show, wrote the AV Club's Dennis Perkins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Porter also made an appearance on the return of "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" (at-home version). It featured celebrities such as Morgan Freeman, Kristin Chenoweth, Ben Platt, Idina Menzel, Audra McDonald, Lin-Manuel Miranda and more for 3 1/2 hours, ending with songs by Barry Manilow.</p>
<p>O'Donnell championed Porter's career with nine appearances on her former daytime show after the two met as stars of the Broadway revival of "Grease" in the mid-1990s. Her return was produced by Erich Bergen, whose family is from Squirrel Hill, and who was due to be a Trust Cabaret series season closer next month.</p>
<p>Also appearing was Carnegie Mellon alumnus John McDaniel, O’Donnell’s longtime music director, who recently returned to Pittsburgh Public Theater as music director of&nbsp;“Little Shop of Horrors.”</p>
<p>Bergen popped up on screen frequently as technical troubles arose, but the steady parade of Broadway stars was an online triumph for The Actors Fund, which aids entertainment professionals onstage, on camera and behind the scenes. <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1133432/rosie-o-donnell-raises-500-000-in-star-studded-fundraiser-for-coronavirus-relief" target="_blank">https://www.eonline.com/news/1133432/rosie-o-donnell-raises-500-000-in-star-studded-fundraiser-for-coronavirus-relief</a></p>
