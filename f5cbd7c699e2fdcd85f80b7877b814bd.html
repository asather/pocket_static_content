<p>Pittsburgh police announced Monday they’re extending the curfew for another night in the city after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/30/Protest-Downtown-Pittsburgh-george-floyd-police/stories/202005300054" target="_blank">protests turned violent&nbsp;on Saturday</a> as hundreds of demonstrators came out in force Downtown against police brutality following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s Department of Public Safety instituted the curfew Saturday night in an attempt to quell the protests.</p>
<p>The extension means the curfew goes into effect at 8:30 Monday night and lasts until 6 a.m. Tuesday, according to city officials.</p>
<p>Saturday’s protests started out a peaceful march&nbsp;but then escalated into riots and looting, resulted in numerous injuries to police officers, several people in the crowds and at least three journalists who were attacked by protesters. None of the injuries were serious, according to police.</p>
<p>A total of 71 businesses in Downtown Pittsburgh were damaged or looted, city officials said Sunday, and two Pittsburgh police vehicles were set afire.</p>
<p>Police said that 43 adults and one juvenile were arrested.</p>
<p>Sunday’s demonstrations Downtown and in East Liberty, Butler County and Greensburg were overall peaceful.</p>
<p>Protesters throughout the Pittsburgh region, like many in cities across the country, were demonstrating following the Memorial Day death of Mr. Floyd, a black man in police custody who pleaded with police that he couldn’t breathe as&nbsp;a white officer pressed his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf has activated the National Guard to assist cities. The Guard was deployed in Philadelphia after days of protests led to over 400 arrests and city officials closed most businesses and services.</p>
