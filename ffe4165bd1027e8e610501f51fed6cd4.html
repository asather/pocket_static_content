<h1>One year later, ACC Network access is still frustrating football fans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hoping to watch Pitt football’s season opener against Austin Peay on Saturday to break up your pandemic monotony?</p>
<p>Forget about going to the stadium. Heinz Field will be closed to fans for at least the Panthers’ first two games. And with COVID-19 restrictions in place, you&nbsp;can probably write off posting up for four hours at a local sports bar or restaurant, too.</p>
<p>That reality will leave most fans stuck with home television as their only viable option. But if you’re a subscriber to Comcast Xfinity or Armstrong Cable — two of the region’s dominant cable providers — you’ll be out of luck there as well.</p>
<p>Neither has carried the ESPN-affiliated ACC Network, which has the rights to Pitt’s first two games, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2019/08/19/ACC-Network-how-to-watch-pitt-football-virginia-clemson-miami/stories/201908190014" target="_blank">since it launched last August</a>. Negotiations have been stalled, costing thousands of Pitt fans hours of game broadcasts and original Panthers-themed programming, and neither side seems to expect a deal for 2020 with kickoff looming.</p>
<p>“While we currently do not have an agreement with Comcast to carry ACC Network, it is available nationwide through distributors like DIRECTV and DISH and all major pay TV streaming providers including AT&amp;T TV NOW, fuboTV, Hulu, Sling TV, and YouTube TV — all of which can be activated immediately without a service call,” ESPN spokeswoman Amy Ufnowski said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We continue to have discussions but do not have anything to announce at this time.”</p>
<p>Robert Grove, Comcast’s vice president of communications for the Keystone Region, was even briefer. “We do not have an agreement to carry ACC Network. The ACC and ESPN elected to place these games on that channel,” he said.</p>
<p>Comcast has 1.7 million customers in its Keystone Region, which includes all of Pennsylvania excluding Philadelphia,&nbsp;as well as part of the Maryland panhandle, northern West Virginia and eastern Ohio. The cable giant has played hardball with college conferences upon the launch of affiliated networks in the past. The Big Ten Network’s 2007 launch came almost a full year before it appeared on the system.</p>
<p>For its part, Armstrong still doesn’t have the Big Ten Network on its slate. The issue? Carriage fees, which networks charge providers for access to their content.</p>
<p>“The biggest problem here remains that sports already account for more than 40% of the costs on basic programming services for cable TV,” said David Wittman, vice president of cable marketing at Armstrong.&nbsp;“The vast majority of customers tell us they like our service, but they’re very concerned about the rates, and that is something we take very seriously.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>That stalemate will, in all likelihood, be broken eventually. The Big Ten Network’s negotiations with Comcast were resolved when it accepted a lesser carriage fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Pitt deputy athletic director and chief operating officer Christian Spears explained, Comcast’s distribution agreement with Disney, ESPN’s parent company, expires at the end of next year. That should give Disney leverage to have the ACC Network included in the next agreement, as Comcast almost surely won’t want risk going a day without offering the flagship network’s other programming to sports-hungry subscribers.</p>
<p>But that long-term promise is little consolation if the games you’re starving for are effectively blacked out for you over the next several months.</p>
<p>It’s for that reason, Spears said, that many in the Pitt athletic department have changed their TV providers in the past year, depending upon their needs. His family chose to add Sling, which streams a lot of live television, including the ACC Network.</p>
<p>“It was literally eight fields and a credit card number, and it’s on my TV today,” Spears said. “It doesn’t have to be something overly burdensome or complex, nor does it have to be extremely expensive. People just have to decide that if you’re not going to carry what I want, I’m going to do something different.”</p>
<p>Sling, for example, offers the ACC Network on its sports extra package, which is $10 on top of a base fee of $30. That provides access to dozens of other popular channels as well. It’s compatible with simple plug-in devices such as Roku, so the setup is pretty simple if you have a working WiFi connection.</p>
<p>Pitt is also looking to provide one-time access to the network through tailgate packages, about which it hopes to announce details before the Syracuse game Sept. 19.</p>
<p>Just don’t look for the games on local television, where they’ve often aired in the past if they weren’t carried nationally on networks such as ESPN, ESPN2 or ABC. Spears is hopeful that matchups with teams such as Notre Dame and Louisville will air on channels with wider distribution, but at least for the first two games, your options are a provider that includes ACC Network or nothing.</p>
<p>That, as you might expect, doesn’t sit well with many fans.</p>
<p>“Hey @Xfinity, considering fans aren’t allowed to attend games this year, maybe now would be a good time to start carrying the ACC Network so I can actually watch the local team,” user @GregariousKoch tweeted Monday.</p>
<p>“Still disappointed that after one year the ACC Network is unavailable on @Xfinity for Comcast subscribers! Be better!” tweeted @CUMan91.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Pitt will continue to produce programming for the network, which despite its carriage issues appears in 63 million homes. Last year, Spears said 175 broadcasts originated locally, showcasing a wide range of Pitt teams beyond football and men’s basketball, which draw the most eyeballs.</p>
<p>The athletic department is also trying to give fans advance notice so they don’t sit down to watch the game only to find out their cable package doesn’t include it. Spears feels most understand the situation, though.</p>
<p>“The majority of our fans do know, and they’ve done the things we’ve asked them to do,” Mr. Spears said. “Dial up the Comcast group and let them know how disappointed they are.”</p>
