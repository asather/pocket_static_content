<h1>City man indicted in drug gang case charged with shooting ATF agent during raid</h1>

<p>Federal authorities have charged a Pittsburgh man with shooting a federal agent during an Uptown raid in June.</p>
<p>Dion Williams is accused of shooting a U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent in an early-morning sweep on Marion Street on June 18 that targeted members of an alleged drug gang with ties to slain rapper Jimmy Wopo.</p>
<p>The agent, whose name has not been released, was treated at the scene by ATF medics and taken to a hospital. ATF said he is recovering.</p>
<p>Authorities had not previously named the alleged shooter, but said the incident happened at the address of Williams, 44, of 1 Marion Street, who was among 12 people indicted under seal on June 16. The case was unsealed two days later as agents swept in to make arrests.</p>
<p>Williams is charged with assault on a federal employee and violations of federal gun laws.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Williams shot the agent, a member an ATF Special Response Team, at about 6 a.m. as he breached a doorway.</p>
<p>“My office has zero tolerance for assaults upon or violence directed against law enforcement&nbsp;officers. Violent drug trafficking felons like Dion Williams who brazenly use illegal firearms to&nbsp;shoot at law enforcement officers have no place in western Pennsylvania,” said U.S. Attorney&nbsp;Brady in a statement announcing the charges.</p>
<p>Michael Christman, special agent in charge of Pittsburgh FBI, said "anyone who fires at law enforcement threatens the safety of our community and will face serious legal consequences."</p>
<p>John Schmidt, acting special agent in charge of ATF's Philadelphia office, which covers Pittsburgh, said that while danger is part of ATF's job, anyone who tries to kill a federal agent is a "clear and present danger" to law enforcement and the community.</p>
<p>"Today, we applaud the multi-jurisdictional efforts that resulted in the indictment of&nbsp;this alleged violent offender," he said.</p>
<p>The drug operation was a joint investigation by the FBI and ATF.</p>
<p>In addition to shooting the agent, Williams is accused of being a felon in possession of a gun. He has four prior drug convictions in Allegheny County and one prior drug conviction in U.S. District Court. Under federal law, felons can't have guns.</p>
<p>Williams faces a prison term of not less than 10 years if he's convicted.</p>
<p>The underlying case was a multi-defendant wiretap investigation of an alleged cocaine ring operating throughout Pittsburgh and Allegheny County with connections to the “11 Hunnit” street gang in the Hill District that federal agents say was led in part by slain rapper Jimmy Wopo.</p>
<p>The lead defendant in the new case is Donald Epps, 65, of New Kensington, who is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilos or more of cocaine.</p>
<p>The others indicted with Mr. Epps and Williams are Michael Glenn, Michael Turner, Gary Wilkinson, Dion Williams, Ivan Upsher, Gerald Bogan Jr., Charles King, Jeffrey Brown, Michael Jones, Timothy Harris and Giles Davis.</p>
<p>The indictment is related to a larger investigation into drug-dealing by the 11 Hunnit gang in the Hill District that resulted in a separate indictment. So far 22 people have been charged in four related indictments stemming from the 11 Hunnit investigation.</p>
