<h1>COVID-19 concerns suspend Western District federal courts again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>All federal civil and criminal jury trials have again been suspended in the Western District of Pennsylvania because of the continued threat of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak issued an order to that effect on Thursday, saying all trials set to start before Nov. 2 are continued pending further court orders.</p>
<p>The judge has issued similar orders in recent months as the pandemic continues.</p>
<p>The courthouses in Pittsburgh, Erie and Johnstown remain open for business and judges are holding hearings, some in person but most by video conference. That will continue, Judge Hornak said, at the discretion of each judge in accordance with his previous orders and the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p>"All judicial officers are encouraged to continue to conduct proceedings by telephone or video conferencing wherever in their judgment doing so is practicable in a given case and on terms as permitted by law, and to take reasonable measures to avoid the necessity of out-of-town travel (especially by public conveyance) of any litigant, counsel or the public," the judge ruled.</p>
