<h1>Trevor Williams, Pirates Charities to fund drive-up distribution for food bank</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As part of the Major League Baseball’s “Home Plate Project,” pitcher Trevor Williams and Pirates Charities will donate $30,000 to the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, the team announced in a press release Friday.</span></p>
<p>The money will help fund a drive-up food distribution at the food bank’s Duquesne headquarters on Monday, April 27, as the donation will provide meals for up to 1,000 families in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>“I am honored to again work with these incredible groups and make an impact locally with the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank to support children and families throughout Pittsburgh,” Williams said in a statement. “The idea of the Home Plate Project is to support some of the most vulnerable in our communities, and during this pandemic, we felt this help was needed immediately.”</p>
<p>More than 50 MLB Players from all 30 clubs raised nearly $1 million through the "Home Plate Project," providing over 4 million meals to support childhood hunger prevention.</p>
<p>The Pirates and Pirates Charities made a $50,000 donation in March that supported multiple food distribution events throughout southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Williams isn't the only Pirates player who has recently contributed to the food bank. Jameson Taillon donated approximately $5,000, which he won while playing Fortnite with Penguins winger Zach Aston-Reese in a TwitchRivals SuperGames tournament.</p>
