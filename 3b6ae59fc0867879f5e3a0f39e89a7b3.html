<h1>Fishing Report: Catfish, walleye and bass caught in cooling waters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Lake Erie</strong> (Erie County) Walleye remained catchable at 65-70 feet, and some steelhead trout were caught off the larger creek mouths. Smallish panfish and yellow perch were taken in the bay.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny Reservoir</strong> (Warren County) Despite low pool level, walleye were taken on crawler harnesses and spinners at 40-50 feet. Northern pike went for spinners in the bays and smallmouth bass took crankbaits and plastic worms.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Warren County) Low output at the dam hampered fishing, but fly and spinner anglers caught big brown trout between Hemlock Road and Route 59.</p>
<p><strong>French Creek</strong> (Crawford, Venango counties) As the creek cooled, Northern pike, walleye and smallmouths were taken from Franklin to Meadville.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Wilhelm</strong> (Mercer County) Catches of largemouth bass, walleye and panfish were reported.</p>
<p><strong>Raccoon Lake</strong> (Beaver County) Largemouths and bluegills were taken throughout the lake.</p>
<p><strong>North Park Lake</strong> (Allegheny County) Miles Goas, 4, of Harrisville, Butler County, caught his first fish, a 7-inch largemouth bass, on Aug. 30.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Allegheny County) Tommy Lippert of the North Side used garlic chicken liver to catch two channel catfish of 20 and 23 inches during Venture Outdoorsâ€™ TriAnglers fishing program. Participation, rods, tackle and live bait are free with registration on Wednesdays from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Details at <a href="https://www.ventureoutdoors.org/events/752028187/" target="_blank">ventureoutdoors.org</a> or 412-255-0564.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio River</strong> (Allegheny County) A good-size flathead catfish was caught from shore near Brunot Island.</p>
<p><strong>Conemaugh River</strong> (Westmoreland County) Kayakers and waders caught smallmouth bass despite low, clear water.</p>
<p><strong>Cross Creek Lake</strong> (Washington County) Lake Ward, 15, of McDonald, caught a nice channel catfish with a live minnow fished on the bottom. Crappies up to 14 inches were suspended in 10-20 feet of water and took tipped spinners and jigs. Bluegills were on the small side. Largemouth bass went for 6- or 7-inch soft plastics fished on the surface at dusk.</p>
<p><strong>Quemahoning Reservoir, Quemahoning Creek</strong> (Somerset County) With the lake down about 4 feet, the state Fish and Boat Commission and Department of Environmental Protection confirmed the presence of the invasive algae didymo in the creek. It is strongly suspected in the lake. Didymo is not toxic to humans but smothers macrobiotic life and can ruin fisheries. Anglers and boaters were advised to scrub waders, boots, hulls, motors, lines and trailers on leaving the Que.</p>
<p><strong>Youghiogheny River Lake, Youghiogheny River</strong> (Somerset, Fayette counties) The lake remained significantly low, but anglers reported catches of smallmouth bass and panfish. The river was back to normal flow and anglers picked up smallmouths, channel catfish and freshwater drum.</p>
