<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 01.22.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ok, kids, we're going to be starting in less than 20 min so get those questions ready (if you haven't already). <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, let's get started. Here we go....</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: I have fr that want the St to sign Eifert. Woul they just be going from one injury prone TE to another? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I hav alway likd Eifert, but i agre w you -- injry prone.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: Do you see the Steelers cutting: Foster, McDonald, Chickallo, Barron, Nix, and Berry in or to franch Dupree and sign restricted their FAs? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Antonio Brown</strong>: Am I done forever in the nfl? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I sure hope so.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: gerry would you Like the idea to release Mcdonald and With that money go get hunter henry from L.A as our big offseason Move? I do based on draft not being good on TE’s. Keep Vannett and focus on other needs at draft.. is it plausible? Any Comments ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, if they could get Hunter Henry, I could understand releasing McDonald. But the Steelers need two solid tight ends, and I think Vannett is a nice No. 3. I think a lot will depend on what they think of Zach Gentry developing in year two. That will be a factor as well.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: I thought LC Greenwood would get into the HOF before Shell. Sev players rallied for Shell. Do you think they’ll do the same for Greenwood? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There was a lot of sentiment for that. L.C. was a four-year Super Bowl starter, Shell just two.</p>
<p><strong>Emma</strong>: If at our pick in second round there is a Real stud on defense available would you take him? Regardless of position or has to be offense no way around it? What would you do? Thanks Gerry <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nope. Offense, offense, offense</p>
<p><strong>Kissfan48</strong>: Gerry, If the news about Ben is not what we want to hear, should the Steelers bring in a veteran Qb to maybe not be #2 since they seem to like MR but just in case MR has some bad games? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they should do thaty regardless if the progress on Ben is good or slow.</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville </strong>: Hi Gerry. Any chance the Canada hire was more about the total <br> <strong>Alan in Nashville </strong>: offense and not just the QB’s? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: A lot of position coaches put in their two cents on the game plan. It wouldn't surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Gerry - Going to be a great day in Canton at the HOF game weekend. The Steelers are playing in the game, The Chin, Donnie Shell, Troy and possibly Faneca being inducted with Hard Knocks there to chronicle it all! Who gave the best HOF induction speech you ever heard? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: FYI, Donnie Shell won't be there that day. He and the other Centennial members will be inducted another day. Cowher, though, will be there with the others. To answer your question, and I have heard many -- Bradshaw!</p>
<p><strong>steelerburrito</strong>: Do you think Matt Canada will be more than a quarterback coach with the Steelers? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The one thing I take from the hiring of Canada is his college background, and we're seeing more and more of the college game creeping into the NFL. I think he gives the Steelers a person who can lend some of that, if necessary. When Randy Fichtner was the QB coach, he helped the offensive coordinator with some of the passing routes.</p>
<p><strong>JT</strong>: Gerry, In your opinion have the Steeler's fallen behind on innovation in staying ahead of other teams? Not shaking up this coaching staff is a head scratcher. Thank you. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they see they have to do more things offensively with motion to free up their playmakers. But I think it has been easy for them, and understandably so, to use the injury to Ben as a reason not to panic and blow everything up. It's really not fair to evaluate the offense when Ben is not running it.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: What's your "gut feeling" on Ben's successful return? Don't mean to be a Debbie Downer, but I just keep seeing Bradshaw in 83 with two TD passes in the first half looking like the old Bradshaw and then he doesn't return for the second half never to throw a pass again. What's the difference in Ben's injury and Bradshaw's? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The difference is that Bradshaw had surgery, didn't tell anyone, and started throwing before he should have because he thought his arm felt good. That set him back for the entire season and he was never the same. That's the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Disgusted</strong>: Some sports agents are parasites; Rosenhaus stayed as long as there was a glimmer of a pay check then dumped AB. After all he made, he could if tried to help by tricking him into a CTE scan and help as a stipulation of a contract. Your thoughts <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Antonio Brown listens to nobody, not even his agent. Don't blame Rosenhaus. He hung around long enough, tried to put out all his fires, and realized the guy is never going to change, never going to get the help he needs. What is there left for Rosenhaus to do -- settle his lawsuits??</p>
<p><strong>GjSteel</strong>: Hi Gerry, what's your feel at where the Steelers priorities are in the draft? RB ,OG, TE? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Something like that. Depends what they do in free agency.</p>
<p><strong>steelerburrito</strong>: What do you think of Case Keenum as a veteran backup if Ben's elbow doesn't respond well in the off season? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't have a problem w that, even if Ben's arm is fine.</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Gerry - any chance Troy is a no-show foe the HOF induction? Does he take that opportunity to extend an olive branch and put bad feelings to rest? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't the Hall of Fame induction has anything to do with whatever issues he seems to have with the Steelers.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: Are Steelers undervaluing tight end? Team hasn't really done anything since Miller retired. Best teams have studs. I'm starting to think it's become the second most important offensive position but depending doesn't reflect that. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No they haven't. That's why they traded for Vance McDonald in the first place. I wouldn't call the contract they gave Ladarius Green "undervaluing" the position. But they have to pay more attention to the position, and I think you will see them do that in free agency and/or the draft.</p>
<p><strong>Andy</strong>: Gerry, you still have me blocked on twitter, please unblock me! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Andy, I tried. Did you give me the correct handle?</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: do you think Switzer is gone? His YAC is terrible and they have a better option returning kicks now- <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Good possibility, but don't bet the house on it.</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: why 5 games if you play in the HOF? why not stick with 4? less risk of injuries- <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Agreed. But you and I don't make the schedule.</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: how do you think the "challenge assistant" that they hired for the season did? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'd have to look at the replay.</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: If Ben is not able to make it back next season would you consider a Phillip Rivers if available? Thank you. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nope</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: If a QB like Jake Fromm or Jordan Love would be available with the Steelers first pick would they select him or do they still go with a RB/TE/WR or OLB if Dupree isn't signed/tagged? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. They are not better than Mason Rudolph</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Great chats. This isn't a criticism I a genuinely curious why Ben doesn't like to use play action? I assume its because it takes his eyes off the field? after seeing it some much with playoff teams I hope we bring more of that to the offense <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I've seen Ben use play-action a lot, maybe not as much as some, but enough.</p>
<p><strong>Bens Boot </strong>: crystal ball do we have the same OC and DC in 2022 <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: I'm sure the NFL is aware that although ticket sales are high, attendance is low and watching football from your own couch is a better option... do you think the bubble will burst &amp; prices drop? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nope. That's like expecting salaries to drop.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: If the medical report on Ben Roethlisberger is negative would the Steelers be looking at short term option at QB like Philip Rivers or Eli Manning or a longer term option like Teddy Bridgewater or Marcus Mariota? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: What I think they are looking at is a veteran QB to add to the room, a third guy. Right now, Rudolph is the top backup. Plus, Mariota and Bridgewater are going to do somewhere where they can start, not sit on the bench.</p>
<p><strong>Heath Miller Fan</strong>: Gerry, thanks for doing the chat. It seems to me the NFL is always changing (passing game vs running game, etc.) Now teams appear to be headed the other direction with the emphasis on the running game. My observation is the Steelers always appear to be 1 or 2 seasons behind the trend. So, this offseason they’ll focus on improving the running game which by my count is 2 seasons too late we’re never ahead of the curve. By the way, how many times in the offseason interviews has Art said he wants a better run game? Seems alot. Thanks <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, for 15 years they've been ahead of the curve with the passing gamer because of Ben Roethlisberger, and rightfully so. They weren't behind the curve when they drafted Le'Veon Bell. If anything, they were ahead of the curve with a multi-purpose back. The Steelers have put their emphasis on protecting Ben, which is why he is the least sacked QB in the league since 2015. If they decide to put a lot of emphasis on the run, they have to change the way their offensive line performs and that will mean more pressure on Ben. I hear ya about the emphasis on the run game, and I agree. But you can't always have everything, though the Steelers did with Ben, Bell and that narcissistic WR.</p>
<p><strong>Bens Boot </strong>: how do we transition from our o-line that was built to pass block? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's a good question. And this is where they will miss Mike Munchak.</p>
<p><strong>AdamShame</strong>: public, isnt it remarkable how the Steelers managed him for so long? Or was there alot of covering up of rude behaviors like ditching on charity events and acting the fool at camp? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There was a lot of enabling to be sure. I would be careful to use the words "managed him," as though they controlled the behavior we see today. He was never this bad with the Steelers. Annoying? Irritating? Unaccountable at times? Yes. But he was never this bad. His erratic behavior started to happen, though, at the beginning of the 2018 season.</p>
<p><strong>Bens Boot </strong>: love the signing of Canada but why have most of his coaching stints been short ? out of football last year ? seems Odd <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Certainly not the picture of stability.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Since Burns was a no. 1 pick and Davis was a no. 2, will the Steelers be able to get compensatory picks when they leave? I Dont understand how that is figured but it would be nice if the Steelers end up with something for those wasted picks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They will but only if the number of free agent losses is greater than the number of free-agent signings. That they were high draft picks will factor into the equation somewhat.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: If "affordable/reasonable" do we make a play for AJ Green, I think we need a vet WR <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I wouldn't hold your breath on that one.</p>
<p><strong>Ernie</strong>: Gerry, Is this the least talented coaching staff you have seen since your time covering the black and gold? Thank you. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well...uh....hmmmmm....good question. Through the years, I have always thought the coaching staff was always one of their under-appreciated strengths. Let's say that.</p>
<p><strong>NFL Shop Customer</strong>: what's the humane thing to do with the #84 jersey I received as a Christmas gift in 2017? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: What's the words from "Disco Inferno?" Burn, baby, burn.</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Gerry, if free agent TE's like Hooper, Ebron and Hunter prove too expensive for the Steelers, are there any dark horses that they would consider? Or do you think they would just go the draft route instead (even though TE class is weak this year). Thanks! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I haven't looked at all the available tight ends. You can have Ebron -- too many drops. But, what they do in free agency will determine what they do in the draft. My guess is they will try to sign a decent tight end in free agency and concentrate on RB and OL early in the draft. Or sign a guard in free agency and concentrate on RB and TE in the draft.</p>
<p><strong>ReallyRealRick</strong>: Can you see - with the addition of Canada as a fresh offensive mind - the Steelers use JT Barrett like the Saints use Taysom Hill? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. J.T. Barrett won't even be on the team.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Are the steelers signing a WR coach in the near future? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes. Very soon.</p>
<p><strong>ReallyRealRick</strong>: Biggest draft need? My opinion is OL. That can improve both the run and pass game. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's not the biggest. Skill people.</p>
<p><strong>PPG Fan</strong>: What are the steelers beat writers doing in the offseason? Vacation time or the steelers news never sleeps (even when there isn't news) <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: We're like New York -- never sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff M</strong>: Given the age and potential decline of the OL can you see the Steelers draft a T or C that can play G for a year or 2 and move once Pouncy or Big Al move on? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes I can see that, but not in the second round. No earlier than fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Utah Jim</strong>: What do you think of Danny Shelton as a possible replacement for Hargrave? His numbers are not as good as Hargrave, but they are close especially outside of sacks. Steelers can get sacks elsewhere and he’s projected to make a third of what Hargrave will according to spotrac.com. Also, he’s a lot bigger body which I think the Steelers need against power running teams. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: If they played more 3-4 defense, maybe. But Shelton does not fit the mold of the type of defensive linemen they like. He is overweight and slow. They don't like that combo, especially if he has to play in sub packages.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Big Chest</strong>: If I asked for help to get my life under control to save me from myself, would anybody from my NFL past or former paid sponsors from my endorsement deals come to my aid and help me? Or did I burn too many bridges already? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You are missing the significance of the operating word there -- If.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Its a shame that all of these TV personalities who criticized Ben are now silent on what a nut job AB truly was. no real question, just venting! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Agreed. But I never listened to them anyway because they had NO CLUE what they were talking about. The only one who knew and was spot on was Ryan Clark.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Do you agree with the recent assessment that the Steelers are light years away? I personally believe Ben and a few well drafted weapons make the Steelers a legit contender next year. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not at all. And the people who say that have no clue what they're talking about. I guess the 49ers were light years away when they were 4-12 one year ago? Or the Packers when they were 6-9-1 in 2018? That's just nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Big Chest</strong>: Diontae Johnson and James Washington and JuJu are a great group of high potential wide receivers around which to build our passing game. Are the 4th 5th and maybe 6th wide receivers on the 2020 roster already? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not all of them. I think Switzer could be back. And I like Deon Cain. Johnny Holton brings nothing. And don't be surprised if they take a WR high in the draft. It's a big year for WRs.</p>
<p><strong>GerryDulacFanClub</strong>: If the Steelers are looking to upgrade the offense this draft should they focus more on OL or RB? It seems like the talent is already there at the WR. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not just a RB, a No. 1 RB. They're not taking an offensive lineman with their top pick, nor should they.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: To me it does not seem poss for the Steelers to bring in both a top tightend and QB for insurance. With limited cap and only a 2nd pick. Wouldnt the best bet be bring in the best playmaker for the offense? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Pay the man! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, lot of OT work this week. We out of time. Might change the chat day next week, so check your local listings.</p>
