<h1>Rough terrain: Regional transportation plan includes less money for local roads next four years</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission’s proposed <a title="SPC draft Transportation Improvement Plan" href="https://www.spcregion.org/get-involved/public-comment/" target="_blank">Transportation Improvement Plan </a>includes more money over the next four years, but less of that spending will be for local road and bridge improvements in the 10-county region.</p>
<p>The draft plan released last week for 2021-24 calls for spending $5.6 billion on transportation, up from $4.9 billion under the current plan. But despite increased spending, the state’s concentration on improving interstate highways means less money for&nbsp;local road and bridge projects, said Andy Waple, director of transportation planning for the agency.</p>
<p>This proposal may have to be adjusted because of funding shortfalls due to the COVID-19 pandemic or because of a possible national infrastructure bill that could inject money into the region.</p>
<p>The agency updates the four-year plan every two years, showing progress on continuing projects expected to be completed in the next two years and identifying new projects that will begin in the near future. The commission includes representatives from Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, Washington and Westmoreland counties and the City of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Overall, Mr. Waple said, the money available for&nbsp;prominent local roads such as Routes 22, 30 and 51, McKnight Road and others has been reduced about 40% to $279 million under the draft plan.</p>
<p>Mr. Waple said that’s because of the state’s decision last year to move $3.15 billion through 2028 to interstate highways.The state is shifting the money&nbsp;— starting with $50 million this year and increasing $50 million each year&nbsp;— because it is afraid it could lose hundreds of millions in federal funds if the interstates continue to deteriorate and no longer meet federal standards.</p>
<p>“It just creates big holes in the care of those smaller roads,” Mr. Waple said.&nbsp;“There’s just not as much money for all those roadways.”</p>
<p>The road projects included in the plan mostly involve work that has been talked about for many years, including improvements to the Route 28-Highland Park Bridge interchange, the ongoing construction of the Southern Beltway near Pittsburgh International Airport and the forthcoming construction of the Mon-Fayette Expressway from Jefferson Hills to Monroeville.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, who doubles as chair of the regional commission, said he understands the funding shortfall but he remains concerned that a lack of road improvements will hurt the regional economy.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, this might be the new normal in transportation,” said Mr. Fitzgerald, echoing comments made last week by Yassmin Gramian when she said projects statewide would be reduced in scope or postponed due to lack of funding.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald said he is holding out hope for a national infrastructure bill to deal not only with road and bridge projects but also water and sewer improvements.</p>
<p>“Certainly, investment in infrastructure is going to need to increase,” he said.&nbsp;“The question is how to pay for it. It makes sense for us to invest in the economy of the nation and the region.”</p>
<p>Another example of the lack of funds is landslide remediation, which has become a more common, expensive problem as a result of heavy rain the past few years. In PennDOT districts 11 and 12 (Allegheny, Beaver, Lawrence,&nbsp;Washington, Westmoreland, Greene and Fayette counties), Mr. Waple said, there are about 350 slides that would cost $235 million to fix, but the plan only has $31 million for 20 slides.</p>
<p>“We have far more needs than resources available to address them,” Mr. Waple&nbsp; said.</p>
<p>He stressed the unusual nature of the this year’s draft because of changes that could be spurred by the state having less transportation money. A high percentage of money for road improvements comes from the gasoline tax at a time when the public is driving less.</p>
<p>“It’s not an ideal time here to put out a draft with everything going on [with COVID-19],” Mr. Waple said.</p>
<p>As usual, the draft calls for the biggest portion of the spending, about $2.2 billion, to go to public transit. Port Authority is expected to receive about $2 billion of that.</p>
<p>New projects in the draft include funding for competitive projects in transportation-related categories such as bike trails, sidewalks and other related improvements. Those projects include:</p>
<p>▪ A Complete Green Street Project at South 21st Street on Pittsburgh’s South Side designed to remove four million gallons of runoff. The joint project by the city, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy and Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, which also includes pedestrian improvements, trees and other planting areas, will cost&nbsp;$5.85 million, including $1 million in competitive funds.</p>
<p>▪ Improving signals, restoring sidewalks and upgrading stormwater facilities around the Jefferson Avenue interchange with Interstate 70 in Washington at a cost of $12.6 million ($492,000 competitive).</p>
<p>▪ Upgrading pedestrian access to Port Authority’s South Hills Junction station as a cost of $6.6 million ($1 million competitive).</p>
<p>The draft is available for public comment until June 12 at the SPC website,&nbsp;<a href="https://publicinput.com/21-24_TIP_Update." target="_blank">https://publicinput.com/21-24_TIP_Update.</a> Instead of in-person hearings in each county, the agency will hold three virtual meetings at 6 p.m Wednesday&nbsp;(Armstrong, Butler, Indiana counties); May 28&nbsp;(Fayette, Greene, Washington, Westmoreland counties); and June 2&nbsp;(Allegheny, Beaver, Lawrence counties and the City of Pittsburgh).</p>
<p>After any changes, the draft is expected to be taken up for a vote on June 29.</p>
