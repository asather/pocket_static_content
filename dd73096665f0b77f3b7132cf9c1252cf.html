<h1>Obituary: For his family, Norman Nadalin was Mr. Fix It, no matter the issue</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In Norm Nadalin’s family, like many others, problems without a clear answer would occasionally arise.</p>
<p>Someone would be in need of guidance, or one of his children might approach him with a question to which he didn’t have the answer. In other instances, something would be broken and in need of a steady and skilled hand to fix it.</p>
<p>Whatever the predicament, the Nadalins never had to look far for what they needed. There was always, as Nadalin’s children called him, Pappy, Norm’s father, Norman.</p>
<p>“If there was a problem, he was taking care of it,” Norm Nadalin said. “If we were stuck somewhere, he was in the car before we probably even asked him to come get us. He was right there for us, always. It was never ‘Well, I’ll just sit here and wait.’ No, that wasn’t my dad. It was ‘OK, I’ll be right over. Whatever you need.’ ”</p>
<p>Throughout his nine decades, Norman Nadalin did what seems simple only in theory, something to which many aspire but fewer genuinely fulfill — he was there for those closest to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Nadalin, of Baldwin Borough, died April 3 of COVID-19 at Jefferson Hospital. He was 94.</p>
<p>In the days and weeks preceding his death, Mr. Nadalin didn’t leave his home, but symptoms associated with COVID-19 started to develop. It began with a fever. By March 23, he had trouble catching his breath. He was transported by ambulance to Jefferson Hospital four days later and was admitted to the ICU, where he was put on a ventilator. After initially testing negative for the novel coronavirus, a second test came back positive. On April 1, his condition began to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Following the death of his wife, Dolores, in 2016, Mr. Nadalin had discussed end-of-life procedures with his family. He did not want any extraordinary measures. He agreed to initial intubation, but only under the condition that it be for a few days and that he recover quickly. His six days on the ventilator were, as his son Norm said, “all he would have wanted.”</p>
<p>After a lengthy conversation with Mr. Nadalin’s doctor, Norm, 64, made the painful decision that followed his father’s wishes. Doctors disconnected the ventilator on the afternoon of April 2, and Mr. Nadalin died about 24 hours later. Shortly before then, though, with family unable to be by his side, a nurse held a phone to Mr. Nadalin’s ear to allow him to speak to his son one final time.</p>
<p>“It was so very hard not to be able to be with him at the end,” Norm Nadalin said.</p>
<p>A Korean War veteran, Norman Nadalin owned several gas stations in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He also worked as an auto body technician. To those who knew him the best, Mr. Nadalin could fix anything, an almost superhuman quality that made him valued, beloved and appreciated.</p>
<p>Mr. Nadalin was, as Norm described, “quiet, but very observant,” paired with a sharp intellect that routinely dazzled and helped those he loved.</p>
<p>“He knew a lot,” Norm Nadalin said. “He had answers for anything. There was very little we could call and ask him about that he didn’t have an answer for. He remembered everything.”</p>
<p>He was married for 69 years to Dolores, who died only a few months before the couple’s 70th anniversary. For six decades, they lived together in a house they purchased when Norm, the younger of their two sons, was 6 months old. He lived in that same home for the rest of his life, even doing his own laundry, shopping and banking until his death.</p>
<p>As Dolores became ill, Mr. Nadalin was a committed caregiver, providing his wife with whatever she needed and more.</p>
<p>“He was just devoted to my mother, completely devoted to her,” Norm Nadalin said.</p>
<p>On April 1, Mr. Nadalin’s older son, Guy, was taken to Jefferson with similar symptoms to his father. He went to the hospital’s ICU and was placed on a ventilator but has since been taken off it. Given his proximity to his father and brother, Norm Nadalin received a prescription from his doctor to be tested for COVID-19 and was notified Thursday that he tested negative.</p>
<p>The Nadalins, like other families across the country and world, have seen the pain and turmoil that the novel coronavirus can create.</p>
<p>“It affected us pretty badly,” Norm Nadalin said.</p>
<p>Donations in Mr. Nadalin’s memory can be made to the Baldwin Independent Fire Co. No. 1.</p>
