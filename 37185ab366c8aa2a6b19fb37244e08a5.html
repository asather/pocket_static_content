<h1>Pittsburgh City Council votes to recommend four police reform bills </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council members on Wednesday voted to recommend four major police reform bills, which will likely get a vote before council members’ summer recess starts next Wednesday.</p>
<p>These bills, introduced by Councilman Ricky Burgess in early June, include prohibiting the city’s acquisition of military equipment and weaponry; requiring a “duty to intervene” on behalf of police officers witnessing “inappropriate” force; moving $250,000 from police salaries to a gun violence prevention fund while creating a budgetary obligation for the fund; and banning chokeholds. These bills come after protests surged in response to the death of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer held his knee to Floyd’s neck for about 9 minutes.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Mr. Burgess introduced amendments to the bills for more clarification after working with the law, police and public safety departments.</p>
<p>Shawn Carter, special assistant to the office of Mr. Burgess, discussed changes to the councilman’s bill calling for the duty for police officers to intervene if another police officer applies inappropriate force on a person. The amendments clarify that the bill will only apply to sworn police officers and exists only in the city’s geographic boundaries. Mr. Carter said this is due to “legal concerns of exercising police power or disciplining police officers for things that happen outside the city.” He also discussed how an officer is not obligated to impose bodily harm upon himself or herself in order to stop another police officer.</p>
<p>“I’m in full agreement for this bill. I was dumbstruck and confounded and appalled at the fact that a man was murdered by a police officer and three officers stood by and didn’t feel the internal integrity to intervene and say, ‘Get off that man,’” Councilman Bruce Kraus said in response to the amendment.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter also discussed amending the bill prohibiting the city’s acquisition of military equipment and weaponry to specify which equipment would be prohibited.</p>
<p>The list of prohibited items include: weaponized aircraft (attack helicopters and weaponized drones); crowd controlled ammunitions that include Chloroacetophenone, or CM gas; wooden baton rounds used in crowd control operations; military surplus weapon systems that are intentionally made for civilian law enforcement and specific only to military operations; and military armored vehicles that are not specifically designed for enforcement use. Mr. Carter listed the MRAP, a mind-resistant ambush protected vehicle, as an example.</p>
<p>After hearing from Pittsburgh police Chief Scott Schubert and public safety Director Wendell Hissrich about the bill, Mr. Burgess concluded that a blanket ban on military equipment was “inappropriate.” Mr. Carter listed how the armored personnel carrier was used to end the standoff in the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2009/04/05/Deadly-ambush-in-Stanton-Heights-claims-the-lives-of-3-city-police-officers/stories/200904050157" target="_blank">2009 shooting that killed three police officers in Stanton Heights</a> and to extract victims from and get police officers inside the building during&nbsp;the 2018 Tree of Life massacre.</p>
<p>Mr. Kraus abstained from voting to recommend the amended bill on military equipment, stating he needs more time to speak with law enforcement before voting.</p>
<p>Councilwoman Deb Gross and Council President Theresa Kail-Smith both abstained from voting on all the bills on police reform.</p>
<p>“Although some of them make sense — like the chokehold ban and duty to intervene — I still want to make sure we have a thorough conversation prior to voting, because they are so serious,” Ms. Kail-Smith said.</p>
<p>In the end, all four police reform bills were affirmatively recommended, with the amendments added.</p>
<p>After the council finished their lengthy discussion, they then voted to recommend the bill allowing the mayor and the Office of Management and Budget to enter into a grant agreement with the county to receive over $6 million in coronavirus-relief funds in order to reimburse eligible city expenditures.</p>
<p>A bill to increase funding for the&nbsp;Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS by $165,945 and Emergency Solutions Grant by $6.4 million was also approved by the council. Mayoral spokesman Timothy McNulty said in an email that the increased funding mostly came from the first round of the federal aid CARES Act funding, with an additional $2 million from the second round of federal funding.</p>
<p>City council also voted to recommend a bill for the city to join in on anonymous sharing of traffic data through the Waze app. If passed, the bill would allow the director of the Department of Innovation &amp; Performance to enter into a data-sharing agreement to access&nbsp;certain online services including the Waze Connected Citizens Program Data Upload&nbsp;tools and the Waze Traffic Data API.</p>
<p>According to a press release sent last week, the data-sharing will only provide&nbsp;“anonymized traffic data” to city employees, noting that the city&nbsp;“takes the privacy of citizens seriously.” City employees will not be able to access or share personal data. Rather, the information will represent&nbsp;“aggregated traffic volumes,” and incident data will not link any specific drivers or drivers who report incidents. This information will be used to help the city understand and address regional mobility issues.</p>
<p>After over four hours of discussion, the council then called a recess instead of a dismissal so they could revisit voting on two bills that were held from voting on Wednesday. One of those bills dealt with providing financial support to community-based organizations after a lengthy dispute during the meeting between Mr. Kraus and Councilman Bobby Wilson on where and how much funding should be provided to organizations in their districts.</p>
<p>Council members on Tuesday also unanimously voted to put a question on the November ballot asking voters if they want to expand the powers of the Citizen Police Review Board.</p>
