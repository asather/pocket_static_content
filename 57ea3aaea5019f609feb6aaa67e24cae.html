<p>Roosevelt Taylor, a star safety on the Chicago Bears’ 1963 NFL championship team, has died. He was 82.</p>
<p>The team said he died Friday but did not provide details.</p>
<p>An All-Pro in 1963 when the Bears won the title, Mr. Taylor played his first nine NFL seasons with Chicago, 1961-69, appearing in every game. A ballhawk, he led the league in interceptions in 1963 with nine, also making the Pro Bowl.</p>
<p>Chicago was 11-1-2 in that championship season, winning all eight games in which Mr. Taylor made an interception.</p>
<p>He also made the Pro Bowl in 1968. The next year, he was dealt to San Francisco for guard Howard Mudd and spent 2 1/2 seasons with the 49ers, then was Washington’s free safety in 1972. The Redskins lost to Miami in the Super Bowl that season, with the Dolphins finishing off their perfect record.</p>
<p>In all, Mr. Taylor had 32 interceptions, 23 with the Bears. He ran back three for touchdowns and also scored on a fumble return.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor was undrafted in 1961 out of Grambling University, where he walked onto the football team and became a star. The Tigers and Hall of Fame coach Eddie Robinson won the school’s first SWAC championship in 1960 with Mr. Taylor.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor’s son, Brian, was a running back with the Bears and Buffalo Bills for a short time.</p>
