<h1>Pittsburgh finishes work on landslides in Spring Hill, South Oakland</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The lengthy work of correcting landslides that occurred in 2018 finally is bearing fruit for Pittsburgh officials.</p>
<p>The city announced Monday that landslides have been cleared and remedial work completed on Swinburne Street between Greenfield and South Oakland and List Street in Spring Hill.</p>
<p>On Swinburne, crews completed a $630,000 project that involved stabilizing the slope and building a retaining wall. The street has been closed for construction since November and before that traffic had been restricted to one lane at a time.</p>
<p>In Spring Hill, crews finished a five-month, $880,000 project to stabilize the slope and build a retaining wall to support List Street after a landslide reduced traffic to one lane at a time in 2018.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Both streets are open to traffic in both directions now but they will be restricted for resurfacing during the spring.</p>
