<h1>Pirates broadcaster Bob Walk recovering from COVID-19, hopes to return by Opening Day</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pirates broadcaster Bob Walk tested positive for the coronavirus and is recovering, his partner, Greg Brown, said on Saturday’s Pirates telecast.</p>
<p>Walk testing positive was later confirmed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>“A couple of rough days, but he says he’s feeling great,” said Brown, who was calling play-by-play on AT&amp;T SportsNet at the time. “You know Walkie, he’s a warrior.”</p>
<p>Brown said the Pirates hope to have Walk back in the broadcast booth for opening day Friday, July 24 against the Cardinals at Busch Stadium.</p>
<p>If the rules for broadcasters are anything like they are for players, Walk would theoretically have to test negative twice before being allowed back.</p>
