<h1>Pirates roll out new ticket program for families</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates are making a kid-friendly change to get more people inside PNC Park during the first two months of the baseball season.</p>
<p>New president Travis Williams announced an initiative Friday that allows parents to bring fans ages 14 and under to April or May games for free with the purchase of a $20 adult ticket. Each adult ticket nets one free kids ticket.</p>
<p>Those $20 tickets will be in special sections throughout the upper grandstand level.</p>
<p>The Pirates also announced an expansion of the kids’ concession offerings. Bucaroos, the family-friendly concession stand located just inside the left-field gate, will have two new locations — in sections 147 and 307.</p>
<p>There, hot dogs, popcorn, pretzels and Coke products will be available for $2.50 each, while nachos and chicken nuggets will be sold for $3 each.</p>
<p>More information on the program can be found at <a href="https://www.mlb.com/pirates/tickets/specials/kids-free" target="_blank">pirates.com/kidsfree</a>.</p>
<p>“Baseball brings generations of families together and creates lasting memories, and there is no better place to do that than PNC Park,” Williams said in a statement. “Our focus is to make Pirates baseball as accessible to as many families as possible and, as part of their overall ballpark experience, families should be able to enjoy a game at PNC Park as often as possible at a reasonable cost.”</p>
