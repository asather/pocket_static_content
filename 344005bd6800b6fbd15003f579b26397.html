<h1>Belle Vernon Area School District reaches contract with teachers' union</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Belle Vernon Area School District and the union that represents its teachers and other staff said they have agreed to a five-year contract.</p>
<p>Ratification of the new contract was announced in a joint statement Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The Belle Vernon Area Education Association,&nbsp;which represents 161 teachers, nurses, counselors and education specialists in the district, had been working without a contract since June 30, 2019, when they issued a strike notice in March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A strike was averted “after two eight hour marathon negotiations sessions” on March 11 and 12, just before schools were closed because of COVID-19, the statement said.</p>
<p>The new contract is retroactive to July 1, 2019 and runs until June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to have secured a five-year deal that offers stability to our members,” Daneen Watson, the education association’s president, said in a statement. “We realize in these economic times that we had to help where we could financially. Our students are most important, and our team kept that as our focus.”</p>
<p>The education association negotiated contract language related to online learning, professional development, and teacher evaluation as well as extra support&nbsp;for special education teachers, counselors and nurses in exchange for some monetary concessions.</p>
<p>Education association members will not have a salary increase for the 2019-20 school year, but they will have an average 2% increase over the final four years of the contract. Modifications were made to the union health insurance that will see premiums increase but allow members to choose between multiple plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district said the negotiations served as a way to determine the long-term financial projections necessary to meet the costs of instruction for the next five years and&nbsp;give potential retirees a chance to plan for the future.</p>
<p>The district said it prioritized remaining “budget neutral” with limited costs increases over the length of the contract.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed to&nbsp;modifications in tuition reimbursement, sick leave buyout, retirement&nbsp;benefits and extracurricular activities, the statement said.</p>
<p>“It was apparent on both sides of the&nbsp;negotiations table that team members understood the current and future challenges for school&nbsp;districts, and that the fair and appropriate completion of the negotiations process was necessary to&nbsp;help keep the focus on the long-term academic and financial success of the district,” Belle Vernon Superintendent&nbsp;Michele Dowell said in a statement. “The settlement will&nbsp;help sustain the quality of educational programs and services in the Belle Vernon Area School District&nbsp;and will provide continuity for our students.”&nbsp;</p>
