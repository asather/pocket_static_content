<h1>Councilwomen want empty lots converted to urban farms to make food more readily available</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Long food bank lines, churches scrambling to cook for communities and neighbors helping neighbors find pantry items are the reoccurring scenes prompting three Pittsburgh City Council members to push for the quick set up of neighborhood gardens.</p>
<p>"We realize there's a real need for food in this city, and it didn't just start with the COVID-19 crisis," said Council President Theresa Kail-Smith, who along with members Deb Gross and Erika Strassburger, introduced an urban agriculture measure Tuesday.</p>

<p>The proposed resolution directs the city’s Department of Finance to identify vacant city-owned lots on which deed restrictions could be placed for the use of community gardening.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/04/02/first-time-jobless-claims-Pennsylvania-unemployment-coronavirus-COVID-19/stories/202004020184" target="_blank">unemployment numbers continue to rise</a> and more residents face economic struggle caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Kail-Smith said she wants&nbsp;“to make sure we’re doing our best to make sure land that is sitting there unused will be put to a productive use for the community.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith said she and Ms. Gross discussed the idea over the weekend and presented it to the administration.</p>
<p>The administration, through its Department of Parks and Recreation, has been distributing thousands of meals each week to seniors and children. In partnership with the Salvation Army and Eat&nbsp;‘n Park, the city gave out just over 4,600 meals last week.</p>
<p>The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank as of April 10 <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/food/2020/04/10/greater-pittsburgh-food-bank-drive-thru-distribution-PPG-Paints-Arena-coronavirus/stories/202004100100" target="_blank">held six drive-up food distributions, providing more than 300,000 pounds of food</a>. Two <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/04/14/Food-bank-distributing-more-boxes-pittsburgh-butler/stories/202004140075" target="_blank">more distributions were scheduled</a> for Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith said she would like to see at least one urban agriculture site established in each of the nine city districts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some community groups already run gardens, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/diana-nelson-jones/2019/05/06/walkabout-St-Clair-Village-Hilltop-Urban-Farm-Hilltop-Alliance/stories/201905060017" target="_blank">23-acre planned urban farm</a> on the former St. Clair Village public housing complex.</p>
<p>Companion bills are expected, as are amendments to the initial proposal, according to both Ms. Gross and Ms. Kail-Smith.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This was just a placeholder to get us started because we don’t want to talk, we want to do,” Ms. Kail-Smith said.</p>
