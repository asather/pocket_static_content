<p>HARRISBURG — Just hours after saying Gov. Tom Wolf had tested negative for the coronavirus out of concern he had been exposed, the governor’s office backtracked Monday and said he had in fact not received a test.</p>
<p>“The information we provided to you was an error,” Mike Brunelle, Wolf’s chief of staff, said in an apology to Spotlight PA.</p>
<p>Mr. Brunelle did not explain how the error happened. Lyndsay Kensinger, a spokesperson for Mr. Wolf, said, “Incorrect information was provided by an administration official.”</p>
<p>In its initial response, Mr. Wolf’s office explained that the governor’s office was contacted by a person who had feared exposure and said they had been near Mr. Wolf. As a result, the office said, Mr. Wolf was tested and was confirmed to be negative.</p>
<p>But in its reversal, Mr. Brunelle said enough time had elapsed between when Mr. Wolf may have been exposed to the person, and because the governor was showing no symptoms, he decided to forgo a test.</p>
<p>The governor is working remotely but is not in quarantine. The same applies to his cabinet secretaries and executive and management staff.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf has in the past week been conducting briefings separately from Health Secretary Rachel Levine, who has been providing updates from the state’s emergency management headquarters outside Harrisburg. His public schedule, which is posted on his government website, has not been updated since March 5, the day before Mr. Wolf declared a disaster emergency as the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>That week, his schedule shows, the governor was in Philadelphia, Montgomery, and Monroe Counties — areas that reported some of the earliest cases of the virus.</p>
