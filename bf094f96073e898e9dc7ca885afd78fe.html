<h1>Despite cancellation of Pittsburgh Marathon, three friends plan overnight marathon of their own</h1>

<p>There isn’t much that could stop Jeff Gleason from running.</p>
<p>On March 17, the Pittsburgh Marathon, which was scheduled to take place on May 3, was canceled over COVID-19 concerns.</p>
<p>Gleason, 62, wasn’t perturbed. A running friend of his, Wayne Kurtz, suggested they do an overnight marathon on Friday morning to replace the Pittsburgh Marathon. So, Gleason, Kurtz and another friend, Bill Thompson, will set out after midnight on Friday, run their makeshift race and then go to work on Friday morning.</p>
<p>“It was almost one of those things where you throw out the idea and see if anybody says, ‘Hey, that’s so stupid, we’re not going to do it,’ or, ‘Yeah, let’s go do it,’ ” Gleason said. “So our other friend, Wayne, just posted it out there and said, ‘You guys want to do a pre-work marathon Friday morning?’ And enough of us people were crazy enough just to say yeah, we’ll go do it. After we all said we’ll go do it, now we’re stuck doing it, I guess.”</p>
<p>For this trio of runners, the length and nature of the run isn’t all that extreme, as all three have impressive accomplishments to their name.</p>
<p>Kurtz ran 30 Ironman Triathlons in 30 days back in 2013. Thompson is experienced with long-distance races himself and ran across the state of Tennessee one time. Gleason, too, has run his fair share of 100-mile and 200-mile runs, which typically span the course of days at a time.</p>
<p>So, Gleason, who is retired but volunteers at a dog kennel, says this particular 26.2-mile, overnight run, while a little outlandish, doesn’t really concern him physically.</p>
<p>“When you run the 100-milers and the 200-milers, you’re running 24-36 [hours], the 200-milers, it’s almost five days out there,” Gleason said. “You’re definitely tired, but it won’t be an issue. It won’t bother me until about four or five o’clock Friday, and then you say, ‘Wow, I’m really tired.’ Getting to the kennel Friday morning and working with the dogs, that won’t be an issue.”</p>
<p>What makes this run special is more symbolic.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis has halted much of life as we know it. One of the lone, outdoor activities that remains safe is running.</p>
<p>A lot of running groups are putting together social-distancing 5Ks or similar events, encouraging people to get out, run and post pictures of their times. It’s a makeshift way of remaining part of the running community that many feel so close to.</p>
<p>For Gleason, this feeling is ten-fold. He nearly had running ripped away from him in 2016, when he had to have a knee replacement. Most doctors he met with told him he wouldn’t be able to run after his surgery. One, though, Dr. Richard Berger in Chicago, said he could replace Gleason’s knee and he’d be able to run as long as he wants afterward.</p>
<p>Sure enough, that’s the case. Still, in the time that Gleason waited for his surgery and then did physical therapy, he felt what it was like to be without running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s something that I’ve done all my life, pretty much, since college,” Gleason said. “So when somebody comes up and says you can’t do something that you’ve done all your life, there’s a big, empty hole there that you think, OK, now what do I do? Because it becomes a big part of your life. It doesn’t define who you are as a person, but it’s a big part of your life.</p>
<p>“...&nbsp;You miss the running. You miss the social aspect of it. All of your buddies and friends that you run with, although you still see them, it’s just not the same, because you’re not running with them and enjoying their company on long runs or whatever.”</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, Gleason and his friends won’t let the current health crisis stop them. They’ll still get out and train when they can, running the long distances they’ve come accustomed to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And on Friday morning, they’ll run their somewhat abnormal marathon in an effort to make things feel a little more normal for them.</p>
<p>“We’re going to get through this thing. It’s not going to be the end of the world,” Gleason said. “... With everything else going on and everything else disrupted, whether it’s work life or personal life, because you can’t do anything anymore, you can still run. All the officials say running is OK, just keep your distance from each other. That’s normalcy. Once you get out there and start running, everything’s normal.”</p>
