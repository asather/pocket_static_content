<h1>Drive-thru COVID-19 testing suspended as more testing sites become available</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Drive-thru testing, offered by Pittsburgh’s Central Outreach Wellness Center as one of the first local COVID-19 testing opportunities in the region, has been suspended until further notice as other medical facilities establish their own testing sites.</p>
<p>Central Outreach began offering drive-thru tests March 16 on the North Side, and at three locations — the wellness center’s parking lot on Anderson Street, Pittsburgh Zoo’s parking lot in Highland Park and in Aliquippa. Drive-thru testing was initially primarily for the uninsured, and those who had been previously turned down through conventional health care channels.&nbsp;But the clinic has tested mainly health care workers and employees from both of the region’s largest health care providers, Allegheny Health Network and UPMC, according to Dr. Stacy Lane, founder of the wellness center.</p>

<p>“We’re still doing testing, but on a case by case basis,” said Dr. Lane of the state-funded clinic. “We’re still doing it for uninsured people too. But we weren’t seeing the uninsured patients, and that’s who we really wanted to see when we started this. Then we went from seeing 1,100 cars a day to 32. We never intended to do this long term, we were very clear about that. We were doing it as a stopgap until Heritage Valley, UPMC, Highmark and the Allegheny Health Department got their own internal structures in place for testing.”</p>
<p>According to data released by the center Thursday, the clinic completed about 1,507 tests in three weeks. Roughly 7.2% of those results were positive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central Outreach was founded in 2015 as an infectious diseases healthcare facility, typically providing tests for HIV, Hepatitis C, and other services such as transgender healthcare and hormone treatments. The small center employs about 58 people. The clinic temporarily lost funding for their LGBT services when fears surrounding spread of the coronavirus began rising, Dr. Lane said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private commercial lab Quest Diagnostics provides testing for the clinic, which offered it’s last drive-thru test Tuesday. Instead of driving up to a site, people will now need to call Central Outreach for potential testing, and the clinic will determine if they qualify based on symptoms.</p>
<p>“I’m an HIV doctor, that’s my first love,” Dr. Lane said.&nbsp;“We’re a small company, so it was very easy for us to pivot and say let’s start testing in the parking lot, because that’s what other states are doing. We did it for three weeks, and the need seems to be less and less, because there are other places for people to go.&nbsp;We’re trying to focus on the patients who need us. We were convenient for people, and we were getting a lot of employees from Allegheny. We were the first one doing testing, a week before Highmark, and a day before UPMC.”</p>

<p>The clinic’s drive-thru testing came a day before UPMC opened its testing site on the South Side. Patients need an order from a doctor to get a test, then a UPMC infectious control expert interviews them to see if they qualify. Central Wellness’ drive-thru testing only lasted about two days at the clinic’s Washington Pa. site as hospitals there began their own testing as well, Dr. Lane said.</p>
<p>“If the systems that are in place now need help, we’re happy to do it,” she said. “CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines have changed. It used to be that people with travel history because were considered extremely high risk. Now, the CDC has changed that to focus on patients 65 and over as being at highest risk.”</p>
<p>As of Friday morning, the Jewish Healthcare Foundation had provided around $30,000 in emergency funds to the center for drive-thru testing, and nonprofit Global Links provided personal protective equipment.</p>
