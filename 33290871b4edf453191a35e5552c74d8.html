<h1>Gene Therapy: Trump did nothing wrong? 'Ok, I'm out'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Some days, you should just listen to yourself, you know?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some days, your impulses might just be right.</p>
<p>Some days, that first burst of snark you throw out on Twitter should&nbsp;enjoy some actual shelf life and even provide a blueprint for the rest&nbsp;of the day. Or the week.</p>
<p>So last Saturday, after hearing Mr. Trump’s lawyer Pat Cipollone open the&nbsp;defense case in the Impeachment trial by telling me that when I hear&nbsp;the facts I will find “the president did absolutely nothing wrong,” I&nbsp;tweeted “Ok, I’m out.”</p>
<p>Admittedly, I didn’t even have time to form a thought, but I’m pretty&nbsp;sure the thought would have been something like, “Wait so, Paul&nbsp;Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos and Michael Cohen went to&nbsp;jail, Roger Stone was convicted, Michael Flynn pleaded guilty, Rudy&nbsp;Giuliani is under investigation, and 28 others including 12 Russian&nbsp;nationals were indicted through the Mueller investigation, but the&nbsp;president, Donald John Trump, for whom all of their varying degrees of&nbsp;skullduggery were derived to assist, “did absolutely nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>Would that I’d stuck with “Ok I’m out.”</p>
<p>But no, I had to go back in and watch six more days of chain-reaction&nbsp;rhetorical wreckage on the bridge Mr. Trump’s illogical jurisprudence&nbsp;engineers tried to build between the president and innocence.</p>
<p>So I got to see Pam Bondi, erstwhile Florida Attorney General, posit&nbsp;that Mr. Trump’s main interest in Ukraine was not excavating dirt on his&nbsp;most-feared political opponent, Joe Biden, it was because Mr. Trump cares&nbsp;so much about fighting corruption.</p>
<p>Pam. Bondi.</p>
<p>The same person who was poised to join the investigation of Trump&nbsp;University until a $25,000 check from&nbsp; Mr. Trump showed up her re-election&nbsp;fund. Trump U, the Fighting Fraudsters —&nbsp;wound up costing the Donald&nbsp;$25 million in fines, but it was worth it because now Pam fully&nbsp;understands his passion for corruption. I mean for fighting&nbsp;corruption. No, I think I mean for corruption.</p>
<p>Pam was hysterical, side-splitting, but it was time for your&nbsp;headliner. Ladies and gentleman, The Man Who Used To Be Alan&nbsp;Dershowitz.</p>
<p>Let me see if I can just crystallize for you what the esteemed Harvard&nbsp;professor said over the course of four days, the worst of it Wednesday&nbsp;night:&nbsp;Trump is king, and you are not. If it pleaseth the king, the king&nbsp;shall doeth it with impunity.</p>
<p>Millions went to their windows, just to see if they were still in America.</p>
<p>“Every public official that I know believes that his election is in&nbsp;the public interest,” Mr. Dershowitz said. “And if a president does&nbsp;something which he believes will help him get elected in the public&nbsp;interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in&nbsp;impeachment.”</p>
<p>Mr. Dershowitz then spent much of Thursday trying to walk that back, as&nbsp;they love to say, although it was a kind of slapstick moonwalk that&nbsp;accused everyone either of willful distortion or conscientious&nbsp;stupidity, including just about every legal scholar worth his or her&nbsp;summa cum laude. Mr. Dershowitz can only hope what he said was willfully&nbsp;distorted because, otherwise, the very nature of the presidency and&nbsp;the very nature of the country are changed forever.</p>
<p>Yeah, that’s all.</p>
<p>Mr. Dershowitz’s pre-trial comments on what it takes to remove a president&nbsp;in 2020 were exactly 180 degrees from he said about the same&nbsp;prerequisites in 1998, but when called on it, he said he was correct&nbsp;then but that he is more correct now. This decades-long march toward&nbsp;ultracorrectness appears to be leading to infallibility, much as in&nbsp;the case of His Royal Trumpness. But it has infected Mr. Dershowitz’s&nbsp;memory.</p>
<p>Less than four years ago, author Alan Dershowitz (then somewhere&nbsp;between correct and more correct) wrote a book called “Electile&nbsp;Dysfunction, a Guide for Unaroused Voters,” in which he noted that Mr. Trump panders “to hard-right bigots who hate minorities, immigrants,&nbsp;Muslims, Jews, and the ‘establishment,’” and he goes on to recommend that&nbsp;voters choose Hillary Clinton in part because “based on their history&nbsp;and track records, I trust Trump less than I do Clinton. On the issue&nbsp;of tone, there is little doubt Trump has been extraordinarily&nbsp;negative, mocking the disabled, referring to a woman’s menstrual cycle&nbsp;and a man’s penis, using racist, sexist, and scatological language —&nbsp;and in general being crass and bombastic. For voters who favor such&nbsp;“direct” talk, the choice of Trump may be suitable. For those of us&nbsp;who seek a president from whom our children and grandchildren can&nbsp;learn good manners and basic decency, and who is more presidential in&nbsp;tone, the choice of Clinton should seem obvious. On the overall&nbsp;question of who would make a better —&nbsp;and certainly a less dangerous —&nbsp;president, I have little doubt. That’s why I will vote for Clinton.”</p>
<p>But here, at one of the most critical points in American history, this&nbsp;same legal scholar is twisting himself into a perfect fool to&nbsp;effectively extend his own dark prophecy.</p>
<p>This “trial” may be all over but the gloating, but the fallout has&nbsp;only just begun.</p>
