<h1>Gene Therapy: Up on the tightrope with Dr. Anthony Fauci</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>By the middle of this week, more than a half dozen special agents had been assigned to protect a 79-year-old immunologist against whatever tangible idiocy might bubble up from the ever-churning internet, where lies run laps around the world before the truth gets its pants on.</p>
<p>I doubt even the knuckle-draggers in the online conspiracy theorists hall of fame could intimidate Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is up on a tightrope in his every waking hour, balanced so delicately between the tenuous approval of Donald Trump, always a candidate for next month’s cover of Unscientific American, and the vast ocean of empirical virological evidence Dr. Fauci’s spent a career curating, and with which he hopes to save a nation.</p>

<p>Is Dr. Fauci ever haunted, in his few spare moments, of those ancient Leon Russell lyrics?</p>
<p><em>I’m up on a tightrope; one side’s hate and one is hope.</em></p>
<p>Who would blame the man?</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci refused to comment the other day on the Trump Show, aka the daily briefing from the White House Coronavirus Task Force, when asked about his heightened security.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t need security,” Mr. Trump blurted. “Everybody loves him.”</p>
<p>Well, not everybody, at least certainly not online, where Dr. Fauci is seen in some circles as just another Deep State operative in the long-running conspiracy to bring down the president.</p>
<p>“Sorry liberals,” went one tweet I saw Thursday, “but we don’t trust Dr. Fauci.”</p>
<p>Life and death is one thing. Owning the libs is still quite another.</p>
<p>The moment that sent the lunatics out to bay at the moon came on the March 20 episode of the Trump Show when Mr. Trump was introducing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. At one point, Mr. Trump said Mr. Pompeo needed to get back to the State Department, “or as they like to call it, the Deep State Department.”</p>
<p>In the background, Dr. Fauci’s left hand went slowly to his forehead, and that was seen almost universally as a sign of mockery by the far right, because clearly no one over the past month has had any legitimate reason to put their head in their hands.</p>
<p>Don’t touch your face? Good luck.</p>
<p>Then someone went back a few years and found an instance where Dr. Fauci was complimentary of Hillary Clinton, and, well, I suppose now if I spent some time at it I could find a place online where COVID-19 is called the Hillary Virus.</p>
<p>To be sure, you can find pockets of Fauci criticism elsewhere on the cultural spectrum. You can find learned observers and even scientists who think Dr. Fauci has held onto the director’s title at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases through six administrations because he is as politically savvy as he is just plain brilliant.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why, in all likelihood, Dr. Fauci’s been able to push Mr. Trump hard toward scientific reality with plain language, all while staying on the tightrope.</p>
<p>“I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Dr. Fauci has said about the president’s talent for spouting misinformation. “OK, he said it. Let’s get it corrected for the next time.”</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci got away with that one, but said in an interview with Science Magazine only this week, “When you’re dealing with the White House, sometimes you have to say things one, two, three, four times, and then it happens. So I’m going to keep pushing.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, always the preening counter-puncher, won’t take forever to push back, and that happens to be among the most ominous possibilities in the atmosphere at the moment. Experts who’ve tried to school Mr. Trump on cold reality haven’t done well these last few years. Whether they’re intelligence professionals, military men, lawyers, economists, climatologists, or even willing lickspittles like former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, they were never more than one presidential tantrum removed from dismissal.</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci might be among the most decorated immunologists of the 21st century, but Mr. Trump’s idea of an expert is pretty much limited to his mirror.</p>
<p>“I know South Korea better than anybody,” he said this week on the Trump Show. “Do you know how many people are in Seoul? Do you know how big the city of Seoul is? Thirty-eight million people.”</p>
<p>Ooh. Missed it by just 28 million. There are less than 10 million people in Seoul. And no, he didn’t mean the population of South Korea, which is close to 52 million. Wouldn’t you expect more from someone who knows South Korea better than anyone?</p>
<p>This is the kind of willful ignorance Dr. Fauci sees from the tightrope. And yet he remains hopeful.</p>
<p>Asked how he thinks this dark period in history will be remembered on a New York Times podcast the other day, Dr. Fauci said this:</p>
<p>“I think it will be remembered (as) really showing what a great country we are. We have been through, as I’ve said, if you look at the history of our country, some extraordinary ordeals. I mean, world wars and diseases and depressions. And we’ve gotten through it. I have a great deal of faith in the spirit of the American people. We’re resilient. We’re going to get over this. And this is going to end.”</p>
<p>Uh-huh. It will end a lot later if somebody pushes Dr. Fauci off that high wire.</p>
<p>I believe it was that same Leon Russell who said:</p>
<p><em>And the wire seems to be the only place for me</em></p>
<p><em>A comedy of errors and I'm falling</em></p>
<p><em>Like a rubber neck giraffe, you look into my past</em></p>
<p><em>Well, baby you're just too blind to see.</em></p>
