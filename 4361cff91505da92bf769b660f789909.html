<h1>Want to bring your ballot Downtown but worried about parking? Several officials offer up their spots</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Want to drop off your election ballot at the Allegheny County offices Downtown but worried parking will be an expensive hassle?</p>
<p>Several elected officials, and at least one city director, will be giving up their assigned parking spaces from now until Election Day to give voters a spot to pull over — free of cost — as they engage in the most basic democratic activity.</p>
<p>“I want to help make this process as easy as possible for folks dropping off their ballots Downtown,” Councilman Corey O’Connor wrote in a Sept. 29 letter calling on other elected officials to join him.</p>
<p>“Because neither the city nor county have free parking near the Allegheny County Office Building, I’ve decided to make my parking space on Fourth Avenue available to voters … Anyone dropping off a ballot will be able to use my spot for short term parking,” Mr. O’Connor wrote.</p>
<p>The letter was sent to Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, Controller Michael Lamb, fellow council members and city directors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voters can drop off mail-in or absentee ballots at the county Elections Division office at 542 Forbes Ave. in room 601 Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Weekend hours will begin Oct. 10.</p>
<p>By law, voters must drop off their own ballots.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, 335,000 voters had been approved for mail-in ballots, according to county figures.</p>
<p>The county also now offers over-the-counter voting, where voters can complete the mail-in vote “all in one place and time,” according to the county’s&nbsp;“Allegheny Votes” newsletter. Voters must bring their completed mail-in ballot application and provide either a driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number.</p>
<p>Other elected officials and employees have joined Mr. O’Connor in giving up their parking spots, including Council members Bruce Kraus, Bobby Wilson and Anthony Coghill; Controller Michael Lamb; and Mike Gable, director of Public Works.</p>
<p>The administration is working on a&nbsp;“broader parking plan” ahead of Election Day on Nov. 3, but no announcements have been made.</p>
<p>"Part of this is that we need to coordinate closely with the county, but our traffic engineers are on standby to help as is our sign shop," said Kinsey Casey, chief operating officer for the city.</p>
<p>Council President Theresa Kail-Smith said in a written response that she is&nbsp;“supportive of whatever we can legally do to help voters cast their ballots. I anticipate a collaborative effort.”</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Parking Authority and the two police officers who work in the City-County Building have been notified that officials are opening their parking spaces, and new signs will soon be posted, according to Mr. O’Connor’s office.</p>
<p>The county will be opening eight additional offices for over-the-counter voting. Locations can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/elections/additional-election-offices.aspx" target="_blank">alleghenycounty.us/elections/additional-election-offices</a>.</p>
<p>The county had delivered 287,000 ballot packets to the post office to be mailed as of Thursday morning. More than 11,000 voters have already returned mail-in ballots, according to county figures.</p>
