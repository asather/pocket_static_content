<p>It took a fast start in both halves, but Central Catholic jumped right back into the running for the WPIAL Class 6A playoffs.</p>
<p>Ben Sarson scored 23 points and Anderson Cynkar 17 to lead four Central Catholic (8-6, 2-3) players in double figures as the Vikings stunned No. 4 Pine-Richland (9-4, 3-2), 78-69, on the Rams’ home floor in a key Section 1 matchup.</p>
<p>Joe Petcash hit five 3-pointers as part of his game-high 25 for Pine-Richland, but it wasn’t enough to overcome Central Catholic’s quick start as the Vikings opened up a 19-10 lead after the first quarter and held on at the end.</p>
