<h1>Pat Narduzzi: 'I'm here at Pitt, and that's where I want to be'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pat Narduzzi is staying at Pitt. At least that’s what he said Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours after Michigan State head coach Mark Dantonio <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/psu/2020/02/04/michigan-state-coaching-search-mark-dantonio-retirement-spartans/stories/202002040114" target="_blank">announced his retirement</a>&nbsp;— sparking speculation that Narduzzi, the Spartans’ former defensive coordinator, could return to East Lansing — Pitt’s head coach dismissed the notion of him skipping town.</p>
<p>Narduzzi, who is under contract at Pitt through the 2024 season with an undisclosed buyout clause, said, “It’s my ultimate goal to be here at Pitt,” at his national signing day press conference.</p>
<p>“Rumors are rumors. Speculation is speculation. ... I can’t address what’s going on up there [at Michigan State],” Narduzzi said at Pitt’s South Side facility, with Panthers athletic director Heather Lyke in attendance along with a collection of cameras and recorders. “Rumors? Squash them. ... I’m here at Pitt, and that’s where I want to be.”</p>
<p>When asked if Michigan State contacted him about the opening, he responded: “Next question. ... I’ll just say, my phone was blowing up [Tuesday] night.”</p>
<p>In October, when there was speculation around Narduzzi and Rutgers’ opening, he said he was staying at Pitt and it was “real simple.” When asked if this Michigan State situation was “real simple,” Narduzzi admitted it was not.</p>
<p>“This was not simple. Because you’ve been there before,” Narduzzi added. “Sometimes you get torn. But there’s no looking back. ... I want to win championships here.”</p>
<p>Of course, Narduzzi could change his mind. Crazier things have happened in college football (see: Tennessee’s 2019 coaching carousel). Michigan State’s opening might pay more than Narduzzi’s 2019 reported salary of $3.4 million, and Narduzzi does have undeniable history at the Big Ten program and with Dantonio. Both of which matter.</p>
<p>Back in 2004, Narduzzi was first hired by Dantonio, who was coaching at Cincinnati. For three years, Narduzzi served as Dantonio’s defensive play-caller with the Bearcats and then followed Dantonio to Michigan State. From 2007-14, Narduzzi led nationally ranked defenses. In his final four years in East Lansing, Narduzzi’s Michigan State defense was the only Football Bowl Subdivision program to rank in the top 10 in total and rush defense.</p>
<p>During his time at Michigan State, Narduzzi was offered “four or five head-coaching jobs to stay at Michigan State,” he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in August 2019.</p>
<p>“I was having fun doing was I was doing [at Michigan State],” Narduzzi said in a preseason one-on-one interview. “When I took a head job, it wasn’t going to be a head job at Akron, which was my first offer. If I’m at Akron, I’m there a year going, ‘C’mon guys, let’s get this [stuff] going. Let’s win, and get the hell out of here.’ That’s where I would be.</p>
<p>“When I came to Pittsburgh, I wanted to come build something. ... All of my energy goes into Pitt and what we can do to become better. I’m never looking for my next job.”</p>
<p>Whether or not that last part is completely true — coaches across the country are always keeping tabs on the market — can be discussed another day.</p>
<p>What matters is on Wednesday, a day in which Pitt looked to its future by solidifying an 18-member recruiting class, Narduzzi said he’s not leaving Pitt — for Michigan State or any other job.</p>
