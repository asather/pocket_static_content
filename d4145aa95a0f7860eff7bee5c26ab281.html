<h1>Dry summer allows allows crews to get Southern Beltway construction back on schedule</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A reasonable winter and relatively dry summer has allowed construction crews building the Southern Beltway to overcome the COVID-19 delay and get the project back on schedule.</p>
<p>Brad Heigel, chief engineer for the Pennsylvania Turnpike, said last week the $900 million toll road still is scheduled to partially open in October 2021 and be fully operational by June 2022. The turnpike is overseeing construction of the 13-mile highway that will link Interstate 79 to Route 22 near Pittsburgh International Airport.</p>
<p>Like all other turnpike and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation projects, construction on the beltway along the Allegheny-Washington County border was shut down for nearly a month in March as the pandemic took hold. When work resumed in April, contractors didn’t know what to expect in terms of productivity because they had to follow a new, 30-page safety protocol for the first time to keep workers socially distanced so the virus wouldn’t spread at the worksite.</p>
<p>Record rainfall in the summers of 2017 and 2018 that exacerbated stormwater runoff problems in the McDonald area early in the project eased this year, when the region was in near-drought conditions that were helpful for construction.</p>
<p>“We were able to push out the the work with the good weather and get back on schedule,” Mr. Heigel said.&nbsp;“This summer with the dry weather really helped. Mother Nature has been very, very good to us this year.”</p>
<p>Last week, the turnpike commission extended its agreement with construction manager CDR Maguire Inc., to add six months and $3.5 million to the contract, raising it to $24 million.The additional money covers unexpected work for the stormwater problems and work Maguire did to prepare the safety protocol for the return to work after the pandemic.</p>
<p>The additional time will involve oversight of post-construction activities such as planting vegetation and final inspection once the roadway is open, Mr. Heigel said.</p>
<p>Mr. Heigel said contractors also may seek reimbursement for restart costs.</p>
<p>“We expect some change orders but nothing major,” he said.</p>
<p>Walsh Construction II continues work on the project’s biggest contract, $174.3 million to build bridges on Interstate 79 near Southpointe and create a valley under them to accommodate ramps for the interchange with the beltway.</p>
