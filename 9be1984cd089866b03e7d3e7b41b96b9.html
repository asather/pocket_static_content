<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf and other state leaders held a press conference Thursday to discuss state plans on handling and preventing the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In it, the governor said cases in Pennsylvania have jumped to 22 cases and that another 219 are under investigation.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said the safety of Pennsylvania’s residents are a priority, and that they’ve learned lessons as&nbsp;“we’ve watched as other states and watched as other countries struggle to control this coronavirus. We’ve learned a lot from their efforts.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf outlined a statewide plan, which begins Friday, to “begin significant and decisive social distancing.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Montgomery County near Philadelphia has been hardest hit so far by COVID-19 cases and will have “special provisions,” Mr. Wolf said. Those provisions “will include closures of all schools at all levels and no mass gatherings.”</p>
<p>Throughout Pennsylvania, Mr. Wolf said he will work to ensure that essential services will not be closed. Those include healthcare services, pharmacies, primary care, outpatient center and hospitals. Mr. Wolf also included gas stations, grocery stores, government offices and mass transit as essential services.</p>
