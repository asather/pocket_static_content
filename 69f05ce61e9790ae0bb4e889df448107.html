<h1>Toomey presses Trump administration to roll back tariffs for Beaver County mill</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON —&nbsp;The battle over a Beaver County mill beleaguered by steel import tariffs escalated on Monday, with Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., demanding the Trump administration grant an exclusion for the plant’s operator.</p>
<p>The Midland mill was restarted shortly before President Donald Trump’s 25% import tariff on steel took effect in March 2018. It’s operated by a joint venture between&nbsp;Allegheny Technologies Inc., a&nbsp;Pittsburgh-based specialty metals producer, and a Chinese company, Tsingshan Group.</p>
<p>The joint venture hoped to hire 100 people who would earn a $125,000 salary on average — and import 300,000 metric tons of stainless steel slabs from a Chinese-owned plant in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Since then, the joint venture has paid nearly $40 million to import the&nbsp;slabs, ATI said in an earnings call last week. Company officials have publicly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/01/09/Allegheny-Technology-chief-says-Beaver-County-midland-plant-in-jeopardy-steel-tariffs-trump/stories/202001090157" target="_blank">sounded the alarm</a>&nbsp;that the plant, which has never reached full capacity, could be shut down.</p>
<p>Last week,&nbsp;Kim Fields, executive vice president of ATI’s Flat Rolled Products segment, said the joint venture was “getting close” to deciding whether to idle the plant.</p>
<p>“We've been paying tariffs now for 23 months,”&nbsp;Ms. Fields said.&nbsp;“We are getting close to the time where we're going to have to make a decision and, if this is going to persist, maybe take a different course.”</p>
<p>The company initially applied for an exclusion from the tariffs shortly after they were imposed. The company detailed that it cannot find the steel it needs anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>After more than a year, the U.S. Department of Commerce, which was inundated with exclusion requests from companies paying tariffs, rejected ATI’s request.</p>
<p>The company filed a second exclusion request in October, requesting an exclusion for 150,000 tons —&nbsp;half the amount in its original request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ve worked hard to make the administration aware of ATI’s situation and are grateful for the support of Sen. Toomey and many other elected officials,” an ATI spokeswoman said in a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>“When a company such as ATI proves it has no viable alternative to imports, and that tariffs would only lead to layoffs and plant closings without generating any new business for domestic mills, we believe the administration should eagerly grant exclusions,” she added.</p>
<p>In Monday’s letter, Mr. Toomey told the Commerce Department the situation is dire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As a result of paying the punitive tariffs, ATI has been forced to operate certain facilities at unsustainable levels,” Mr. Toomey stated in his letter. “I am concerned that if ATI’s exclusion requests are denied or decisions are not made until early this spring, ATI may be forced to announce the closure of the Midland mill.”</p>
<p>The Midland plant has highlighted a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2019/10/10/Manufacturing-recession-Trump-trade-tensions-tariffs-China-NLMK-Navarro/stories/201909250005?cid=search" target="_blank">broader policy disagreement</a> between some free-trade lawmakers on Capitol Hill and the Trump administration, which has erected trade barriers.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey has been a leading critic of the tariffs, introducing legislation that would require the president to seek permission from Congress before imposing tariffs on national security grounds. Last month, Mr. Toomey sent a letter to Mr. Trump, encouraging him to roll back tariffs on imports in connection with the “phase one” trade deal with China, signed at the White House.</p>
<p>Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, also stepped in to advocate for NLMK Pennsylvania, a rolling mill in Mercer County that has paid tariffs to import steel from Russia. Mr. Kelly has been unsuccessful in convincing the Commerce Department to grant NLMK Pennsylvania an exclusion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other lawmakers are pushing the administration to reject ATI’s plea for relief.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s letter comes three days after 10 lawmakers representing districts in Ohio, Kentucky and Alabama argued ATI’s exclusion request would&nbsp;“jeopardize the competitiveness of the American stainless steel industry by providing special treatment to Chinese firms.”</p>
<p>The exclusion request is the&nbsp;“exact type of exploitative behavior the tariffs were designed to stop,” according to that letter, which was signed by Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Toledo, and Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, a Republican representing the Cleveland suburbs, among others. It argued there is sufficient domestic supply of stainless steel and the ATI’s imports are unfairly subsidized by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department did not return a request for comment.</p>
