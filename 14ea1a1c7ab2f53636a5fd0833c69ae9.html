<h1>Redevelopment work moves forward at former Lincoln-Lemington senior living center</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The redevelopment of the former Lemington Home for the Aged into an affordable 54-unit senior development and community health center is moving forward.</p>
<p>Clean up of the interior of the building is underway, said Michael Polite, CEO of Ralph Falbo Inc. and Catalyst Communities.</p>
<p>The deal is being financed with a mix of public and private funds, including project-based vouchers from the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, a loan from Pittsburgh's Urban Redevelopment Authority's Housing Opportunity Fund, and low-income housing tax credits.</p>
<p>In the Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar neighborhood in the East End, the site was formerly the Lemington Home for the Aged, which <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2005/07/15/Bankrupt-Lemington-Home-empties-out-at-last/stories/200507150182" target="_blank">closed in 2005</a>.&nbsp;The redevelopment has been several years in the making.&nbsp;The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/2019/07/11/Affordable-housing-tax-credits-Pennsylvania-Housing-Finance-Agency-Hill-District-Lemington-Home-for-the-Aged/stories/201907110117" target="_blank">URA approved a loan for the project last year</a>.</p>
<p>The majority of the building's senior housing units will be handicapped-accessible, said Jung-Wook “JW” Kim, director of planning and development for the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, speaking after the authority’s January board meeting.</p>
<p>The first floor of the building will be a 16,000 square foot health center that will serve the residents of the building, as well as others from the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The East Liberty Family Health Care Center plans to relocate its Lincoln-Lemington medical and dental office, located nearby on Churchland Street, to the redeveloped facility next year.</p>
<p>“We've been growing by leaps and bounds,” and needed the larger space, said&nbsp;Jo Ellen Welsh, director of development for the federally qualified health center.</p>
<p>The facility will serve more than just the building’s residents,&nbsp;Ms. Welsh said in an interview on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“All of our locations are here to serve anyone who needs us,” she said.</p>
<p>The health center hopes to move into the refurbished space next year.</p>
