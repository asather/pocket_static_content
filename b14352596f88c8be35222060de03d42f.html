<h1>Penguins on pause: What's next for John Marino after superb rookie season?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>There were a number of pleasant surprises in Pittsburgh this season, from Bryan Rust closing in on 30 goals to Tristan Jarry making the All-Star Game. But the most stunning development and maybe the most significant when it comes to the long-term future of the Penguins was the discovery and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/04/21/Penguins-defenseman-John-Marino-reflects-memorable-rookie-season/stories/202004210150" target="_blank">emergence of John Marino</a>.</p>
<p>Last summer, the Penguins sent a 2021 sixth-round pick to the Edmonton Oilers for a little-known prospect who wasn’t even considered the best blue liner on his college team then persuaded him to skip his senior year at Harvard.</p>
<p>At that point, the 22-year-old was sixth among the right-handed defensemen on Pittsburgh’s depth chart. So it sure looked like Marino would spend most, if not all, of the 2019-20 season developing down in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.</p>
<p>Penguins decision-makers have said they knew all along that they had something in Marino. But inject them with truth serum and they would probably admit they initially did not expect him to make much of an impact right away.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan and general manager Jim Rutherford got their first glance at Marino in black and gold at the prospects challenge in Buffalo. He played the best among their group of blue-line prospects, who included Calen Addison and Pierre-Olivier Joseph. Marino kept it going in his NHL training camp.</p>
<p>Marino made the team. Now the Penguins had to find playing time for him.</p>
<p>At first, Sullivan and Co. tried to rotate Jack Johnson, Erik Gudbranson and Marino in and out of the lineup as a way to keep those two veterans happy and Marino busy. But their intentions were clear. On Oct. 25, Rutherford <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/10/25/pittsburgh-penguins-trade-erik-gudbranson-anaheim-ducks-andreas-martinsen/stories/201910250143" target="_blank">found a taker for Gudbranson’s contract</a>, giving Marino a chance to settle in as a regular.</p>
<p>He would have a superb rookie season, impressing with his poise, skating and aggressive defense. He had a team-best plus-17 rating in 56 games when the NHL suspended play March 12. Among Penguins defensemen, only Kris Letang had more goals and points than Marino, who had six and 26, respectively.</p>
<p>Marino, whom Edmonton picked in the sixth round in 2015, was even trusted with time on the top defensive pairing with Letang or Dumoulin sidelined.</p>
<p>In another year, Marino might be getting more buzz for the Calder Trophy. But his scoring statistics were dwarfed this season by other neophyte defensemen in Colorado’s Cale Makar and Vancouver’s Quinn Hughes. Blue liner Adam Fox, his former teammate at Harvard, also put up more points for New York.</p>
<p>Still, even if Marino doesn’t come away with All-Rookie accolades, there is no mystery today about what the Penguins have in him — a good, young defender who just might have a chance to ascend to an All-Star level someday.</p>

<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> In his first NHL game back in his hometown of Boston and with his family in the house, Marino stepped out of the penalty box and scored a beautiful breakaway goal on Jaroslav Halak to give the Penguins the lead. They would lose, but that goal Nov. 4 was among their most memorable.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> Interestingly, Marino’s NHL numbers were a tick above what he did during his final two seasons at Harvard. He had five goals and 27 points in 65 games as a sophomore or junior compared to his totals above.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> The Penguins must decide whether to keep Marino on their second pair alongside Marcus Pettersson. Marino significantly outplayed Justin Schultz this season, leading to that switcheroo. Would Sullivan trust Marino to continue to play top-four minutes with the Cup on the line?</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Marino will make $925,000 next season and is under team control beyond that. The question is: What is his upside? Can he become a top-pair defender? What about an All-Star? Or is this as good as he gets? Even if he doesn’t improve all that much, he’s already a heck of a player.</p>
