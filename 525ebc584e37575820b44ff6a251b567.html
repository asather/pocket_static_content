<h1>Bonnie Pointer, founding member of Pointer Sisters, dies at 69</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bonnie Pointer, who in 1969 convinced three of her church-singing siblings to form the Pointer Sisters, which would become one of the biggest acts of the next two decades, died Monday.</p>
<p>The Grammy winner died of cardiac arrest in Los Angeles, publicist Roger Neal said. She was 69.</p>
<p>“It is with great sadness that I have to announce to the fans of the Pointer Sisters that my sister, Bonnie died this morning,” sister Anita Pointer said in a statement. “Our family is devastated, on behalf of my siblings and I and the entire Pointer family, we ask for your prayers at this time.”</p>
<p>Bonnie Pointer often sang lead and was an essential member of the group through its early hits including “Yes We Can Can” and “Fairytale.” She would leave for a short and modest solo career in 1977 as her sisters went on to have several mega-hits without her.</p>
<p>Ruth, Anita, Bonnie and June, born the daughters of a minister who also had two older sons, grew up singing in his church in Oakland, Calif.</p>
<p>It was Bonnie, shortly after graduating high school, who first wanted to move away from singing gospel songs into clubs to pursue a professional singing career.</p>
<p>“The Pointer Sisters would never have happened had it not been for Bonnie,” Anita Pointer said in her statement.</p>
<p>She convinced younger sister June to join her, and the two began doing gigs together as a duo in 1969. Eventually they’d enlist their two older sisters, who were already married with children, to join them.</p>
<p>The quartet brought unique fusion of funk, soul and 1940s-style jazz, scat and pop to their act, often dressing in a retro style that resembled their forerunners the Andrews Sisters.</p>
<p>They worked as backup singers for Taj Mahal, Boz Scaggs, Elvin Bishop and others before releasing their self-titled debut album in 1973, and the song “Yes We Can Can,” a funky anthem calling for unity and tolerance, became their breakout hit.</p>
<p>They followed up with “That’s A Plenty,” which featured an eclectic mix of musical styles ranging from jazz to gospel to pop.</p>
<p>They even delved into country. Bonnie and Anita co-wrote the song “Fairytale” about a crumbling relationship. The song earned them a groundbreaking gig performing as a rare African American act at the Grand Ole Opry, and they would win their first Grammy, for best country vocal performance by a group.</p>
<p>Bonnie Pointer left the group in 1977, signing a solo deal with Motown Records.</p>
<p>“We were devastated,” Anita Pointer told The Associated Press in 1990. “We did a show the night she left, but after that, we just stopped. We thought it wasn’t going to work without Bonnie.”</p>
<p>She would have only modest solo success. Her biggest hit was “Heaven Must Have Sent You,” a 1979 disco cover of an earlier Motown hit by the Elgins. It reached No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1979.</p>
<p>After making three albums for Motown, she would retire from the studio, and only perform occasionally.</p>
<p>Her three sisters, who had nearly disbanded when she quit, instead regrouped, shed their retro image for a modern pop sound, and became one of the biggest acts of the 1980s with huge hits including “He’s So Shy,” “Jump (For My Love)” and “Neutron Dance.”</p>
<p>Bonnie married Motown producer Jeffrey Bowen in 1978. The two separated in 2004 and divorced in 2016.</p>
<p>She twice reunited with her sisters for public appearances. Once in 1994, when they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and again in 1996 at a show in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“She had always told me, mother, I want something for myself,” Bonnie’s mother Sarah Pointer told Ebony in 1974. “I want to be somebody in this world.”</p>
<p>June Pointer, the youngest of the sisters, died in 2006.</p>
<p>In addition to Ruth and Anita, Bonnie Pointer is survived by her two older brothers, Aaron and Fritz.</p>
