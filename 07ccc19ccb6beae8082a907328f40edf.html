<h1>Howlers owner says club did not 'ban' hip-hop</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you were scrolling through Facebook on Monday afternoon, you may have encountered some outrage about Howlers and hip-hop.</p>
<p>Amber Epps, aka Pittsburgh rapper HollyHood, said in a Facebook post Monday that Howlers had banned hip-hop shows because people were smoking weed in the Bloomfield club at a recent event.</p>
<p>What Howlers did, according to owner Susan Coe, is cancel the long-running monthly open stage that began as a hip-hop showcase.</p>
<p>“It’s just a business decision,” she said. “Not a personal attack against anyone. It had nothing to do with the genre. It has to do with them not generating business.”</p>
<p>She added that it had nothing to do with weed and that Howlers, which never has featured much hip-hop,&nbsp;was open to doing hip-hop shows that would draw crowds.</p>
<p>Howlers announced earlier this month that it will close the Bloomfield location in August and reopen in East Liberty.</p>
<p>In light of Howlers ending the Wednesday night series, Epps announced that she was canceling her PMS vol 6 - Pittsburgh Womxn's Music Showcase on March 21.</p>
<p>“I would like Susan to explain to me what that event, an all-genre event, has to specifically do with events that are solely hip hop,” Epps said in a message.</p>
<p>“Also, in the past, when the open mic WAS strictly hip hop, [Elizabeth Kivowitz] and I wanted to cancel the event because we are getting older and tired (lol), but Howler’s wanted us to keep it going because Wednesday is a slow night for them and they liked the money that came in. We have even had bartenders in the past thanking us for doing those events so they could get tips on a day that is otherwise extremely slow.”</p>
