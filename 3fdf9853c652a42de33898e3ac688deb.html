<h1>All $5,000 offered for gun buyback program in Homewood claimed in 45 minutes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A budgeted $5,000 was given away within 45 minutes Monday morning during a gun buyback at the Episcopal Church of the Holy Cross in Homewood — an “unimaginable” response from a community that hadn’t seen such an occasion since the early 2000s.</p>
<p>“There’s a longing in the church,” said head priest Rev. Torrey Johnson on Monday, after he solemnly informed people that they ran out of money to give them for their surrendered weapons.</p>
<p>“We have to be concerned about our brothers and sisters beyond worship attendance, beyond normal financial tithes and offerings.”</p>
<p>Many people decided to hand over their weapons anyway after the money ran out. By 12:30 p.m., about 72 revolvers and 33 long guns had been surrendered. One AR-15 and an AK-47 was also brought in, officials said.</p>
<p>Rev. Johnson called the larger-than-expected turnout “unimaginable,” as he stood outside church doors in the cold and greeted several people who had come to participate.</p>
<p>Holy Cross, the Episcopal Lutheran Alliance, Homewood Ministries and others, came up with the gun buyback idea and raised the money about three to four weeks ago, church leaders said. They partnered with Pittsburgh police as well, but the city did not contribute to the raised funds.</p>
