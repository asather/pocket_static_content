<h1>Pirates leadership gives takeaways from first day of MLB draft</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>By the time the first round of the MLB draft wrapped up late Wednesday night, the Pirates had added two young college players to their farm system.</p>
<p>With the seventh pick, they selected shortstop Nick Gonzales, who hit .399 over three seasons at New Mexico State, and with the 31st pick, the Pirates took Carmen Mlodzinski, a right-handed fireballer from South Carolina.</p>
<p>That’s enough to give general manager Ben Cherington a good feeling from the night. Especially in regard to Gonzales, Cherington said the Pirates were looking for the best player available in that position, and they feel that they absolutely got him.</p>
<p>“We felt really good about the way the players were lined up on the board going into the round, going into the start of the draft,” Cherington said after the night was finished. “And then, really, we felt really good about the first seven players on the board. Picking seventh, you want to feel good about that first group, and felt good about that first group and not just the group of players, but the order they were in. And really went in knowing we were going to take the best player. Whoever the highest player on the board was at our pick, that was going to be our pick. And I would say that we feel fortunate and excited that Nick was there.</p>
<p>“I would say most of the first round went largely as we expected, but there were some guys who maybe went a little higher or lower within the first round than we expected. All in all, we’re just really excited to come away from tonight with Nick and Carmen, two guys we feel like can be an everyday position player and a starting pitcher in the big leagues.”</p>
<p><strong>Where do they go from here?</strong></p>
<p>So, now what?</p>
<p>Gonzales and Mlodzinski both enter with high expectations for their futures. That’s the nature of being drafted in the first 31 picks. What the rest of the year looks like for them, however, is anybody’s guess.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that there will be a minor-league baseball season this year. Cherington, though, hopes that there will at least be some sort of vehicle for developing players, and he hopes that if that’s the case, Gonzales, Mlodzinski and the rest of the Pirates’ draft picks will be able to participate in that.</p>
<p>Whether that ends up as intrasquad scrimmages in spring training locations or just organized workouts, anything would be better than nothing as the Pirates hope to glean whatever information they can from their two newest players.</p>
<p>“I would expect if that happens, it would be done in concert with other teams,” Cherington said. “There would be some uniformity that that could happen. So in the meantime, we would stay connected with players and start to share information about what it’s like to be a Pirate and some of the programming that’s in places, resources, etc. We’ve got some material that we’ve developed that we’ll be sharing with guys, but our hope is that we can get them to Bradenton at some point late in the year and get on the field and have some development activity.”</p>
<p>As for projecting down the road, Cherington was understandably hesitant to give timetables for when he expects each player to compete for the big league roster. He likely has more pressing issues on his mind, like a second day of the draft or how the rest of the season goes in general.</p>
<p><strong>Depth discussion</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates could have a problem on their hands, but at least it’s a good one.</p>
<p>By selecting Gonzales, the Pirates snapped up yet another shortstop.</p>
<p>In late January, you may remember, the Pirates acquired Liover Peguero in the Starling Marte trade; Peguero, a shortstop, is now their fifth-best prospect, according to MLB Pipeline.</p>
<p>But even though the Pirates have Kevin Newman, Cole Tucker and even Oneil Cruz ahead of Gonzales and Peguero on the organizational depth chart, Cherington made a couple good points about the position, which is generally occupied by excellent athletes.</p>
<p>“If you’re a middle infielder, there are a lot of places you can go,” Cherington said. “There are a lot of different ways to use guys like that. Middle infield is such an important position, we want to have as much depth as we possibly can in that area.”</p>
<p>That’s why the Pirates went with the best player available, and it’s why they probably won’t shy away from adding another shortstop in the future.</p>
<p>Newman has already shown he can play other positions. Cruz may ultimately be an outfielder. Peguero is young.</p>
<p>Essentially, anything can happen.</p>
<p>“I would [say] the more middle-of-the-field players we can have,” Cherington said, “the better.”</p>
<p><strong>Virtual success</strong></p>
<p>As Cherington was wrapping up his availability late Wednesday, something felt off: He was alone in his office when he normally would have been surrounded by a group of people celebrating.</p>
<p>Such is life, as the MLB draft was held virtually, something for which the Pirates heavily prepared. Cherington sought advice from his counterpart with the Steelers, Kevin Colbert. The Pirates maybe even overprepared by conducting around 40 Zoom calls with possible picks.</p>
<p>In the end, Cherington said he was extremely happy with the results.</p>
<p>“I do think there are some things that we can take out of this, not just from amateur and the draft but just generally in baseball operations,” Cherington said. “I was able to actually talk to more amateur players this year than I would in a normal year. Maybe we should have thought to do that before anyway. We probably could carry that forward. I think ways that we’ve been able to use technology to bring people together that may work in some scenarios going forward where maybe you can’t be in the same place.”</p>
<p>Cherington called the Pirates’ knowledge of players “really good, really deep” and said they didn’t feel like they were lacking whatsoever when it came to information or communication on guys.</p>
<p>The only weird thing, again, was the lack of in-person contact.</p>
<p>“We felt good going into the draft with our preparation and all the work that had been done,” Cherington said. “It just feels different because we’re all isolated.”</p>
