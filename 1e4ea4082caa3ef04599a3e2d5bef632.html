<h1>PNC joins ranks of banks accused of processing paycheck protection loan applications unfairly</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank is being accused of improperly favoring big businesses when processing loan applications under the federal Paycheck Protection Program instead of handling them as required on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, was filed in U.S. District Court in Northern California on April 23. It alleges PNC’s practices boosted the bank’s processing fees and unfairly shut out small businesses from receiving money under the program.</p>
<p>A PNC spokeswoman on Wednesday declined comment on the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The suit is among a series of lawsuits filed against big banks around the country in recent weeks — including Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank and JPMorgan Chase — over the Small Business Administration-run program. The program is intended to help businesses keep workers on their payroll during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The lead plaintiff in the case against PNC is Lincoln Network Inc. in San Francisco, which said it has been a small business banking customer at PNC since 2017.</p>
<p>Lincoln Network “was denied access to funds that would have helped it during this economic crisis,” the suit said.</p>
<p>The suit, filed by Berger Montague PC in San Diego, alleges violation of California’s business and professions code and breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
