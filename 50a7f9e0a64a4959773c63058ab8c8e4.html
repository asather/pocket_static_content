<h1>Ruth Ann Dailey: The Wild West of pandemic parking</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last Monday I went Downtown during the work week for the first time in about two months. I was perplexed to find it had become the Wild West.</p>
<p>It wasn’t tumbleweeds rolling through a ghost-town, like it is now on Sundays. No — rather than an echoing emptiness, the streets were full. Very full. It wasn’t moving vehicles clogging the streets, though; it was parked vehicles.</p>
<p>Cars lined no-parking stretches, straddled pedestrian crosswalks and even protruded into intersections. This was true on Penn, Liberty, Smithfield, Fifth, Forbes and Third — with not a ticket or enforcement officer in sight! Clearly I’d missed an important memo.</p>
<p>Actually, during a protracted family crisis, I’d missed three news items, quickly retrieved online: a mid-March announcement that the Pittsburgh Parking Authority was suspending on-street enforcement, an April 20 report that garage revenues had fallen 80% or more and news on May 7 that the authority was furloughing all enforcement personnel.</p>
<p>Surely I am not the only person who sees a possible cause-and-effect relationship at work here.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has proven worse than I’d hoped, and not as dire as some predicted, but what is certain is that it isn’t over. As we prepare now for a second wave of cases by the fall, it might be good to sort through various efforts made to soften the pandemic’s blow. Some sad statistics are a direct result of the virus; some are the result of ill-considered responses to it.</p>
<p>At this point, based on available information, I’d argue that the city’s parking situation — with massive losses to both public and private operators, to their now unemployed staff and to taxpayers who’ll be making up the public-side shortfall— need not have been so bad.</p>
<p>I say “available information” because the March announcement of suspended enforcement contained virtually no explanation and because parking authority staff declined to respond to questions last week.</p>
<p>Mayoral spokesman Timothy McNulty did respond, however, saying the authority’s decision was made “in consultation with the mayor.”</p>
<p>“With so many people staying home and not moving cars and not going to work, it was not fair to continue enforcement,” he wrote.</p>
<p>This assessment rests on several assumptions: that many of the 5,300 or so people who live in the Golden Triangle own cars but do not lease parking spaces, that none of the illegally parked cars belong to people coming into the city to work or do business, and that it is fair or wise to make the rest of us pay — eventually — for the parking these citizens have used for free during the pandemic.</p>
<p>How many Downtown residences are low-income or middle-class? How many are luxury abodes? How many are occupied by well-off empty-nesters and how many by working stiffs?</p>
<p>Whatever the answers may be (they weren’t provided as context for the government’s parking free-for-all), I’m betting there are not many Golden Trianglicans playing find-a-free-spot each night. There isn’t enough legal street parking left in Pittsburgh any more to make this possible.</p>
<p>I don’t know how many Downtown offices belong to supposedly “nonessential” businesses, but most government operations are deemed essential. So — how many fully employed Grant Street workers were suddenly parking for free?</p>
<p>In the 25 minutes I spent driving this small area, I saw very few cars coming and going. The parked cars were there for the day. Had they been forced into garages, revenues would not have taken quite as steep a dive.</p>
<p>Enforcement personnel seem to have social distancing baked into their jobs, but while all this mess was unfolding, they were getting paid to stay home. Now they’ve been furloughed due to plunging revenues. Who said irony is dead?</p>
<p>The powers-that-be should explain why this parking plan is fair and reasonable — or tailor a better one. I’m a crazy optimist, though: I’m confident our leaders will soon realize almost all businesses are essential and our garages will be full again.</p>
