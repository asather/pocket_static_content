<h1>First U.S. death from coronavirus confirmed in Washington state; White House announces travel restrictions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man in his 50s with underlying conditions on Saturday was reported as the first COVID-19-related fatality in the United States.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Duchin, the chief health officer for Seattle and King County, Wash., said the death occurred at EvergreenHealth hospital in Kirkland, Wash.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump described the patient as a “wonderful woman” and a “medically high-risk patient,” at a news conference at the White House.</p>
<p>Washington state officials had announced that a COVID-19 death had occurred in King County, near Seattle. A news conference is scheduled for later today, and the hospital in Kirkland, Wash., released a statement.</p>
<p>The White House also announced new travel restrictions on Iran, South Korea and Italy. The Trump administration said Saturday that the existing travel ban on Iran would extend to foreign nationals who had been in the country the past 14 days. The State Department also ratcheted up its warning advising Americans not to travel to parts of Italy and South Korea affected by the virus.</p>
<p>The first COVID-19 patient to die in the United States came to EvergreenHealth with “serious respiratory issues,” the hospital said in a statement Saturday, though it remains unclear when the patient was admitted, when the symptoms first appeared and how long it took health officials to test the person for the novel coronavirus. The identity of the patient was not released.</p>
<p>According to EvergreenHealth’s statement, the patient was tested for COVID-19 per guidelines set forth by the CDC. The test came back positive, the hospital said. A second patient also tested positive and is in isolation receiving appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump said additional cases are likely in the United States, but he said the illness will be survivable for the vast majority who contract it. He called for calm and said he will meet at the White House on Monday with representatives of major drug companies about an accelerated vaccine.</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence said the risk to most Americans remains low.</p>
<p>Mr. Pence and Mr. Trump addressed reporters in a hastily called news conference at the White House. Mr. Trump assured Americans that “our country is prepared for any circumstance.”</p>
<p>Alarm has spread nationally since late Friday when health officials in Washington state, Oregon and California reported new cases among people who have not traveled recently to countries hit hard by the outbreak or come into contact with anyone known to have the disease, which public health officials refer to as community transmission.</p>
<p>More coronavirus infections were reported internationally from South Korea to France to Qatar on Saturday. Iran reported more than 200 new cases — as well as nine more deaths, adding to the highest death toll from the virus outside China.</p>
<p>China reported its lowest manufacturing numbers on record for the month of February, as the epidemic-stricken economy ground to an unprecedented standstill.</p>
<p>France banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people after the Health Ministry confirmed 19 new cases late Friday, a nearly 100% increase since the day before.</p>
<p>Testing kits from the CDC arrived Friday in California, and additional kits were expected soon, according to a news release from the California Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>"These new testing protocols and resources will help California medical experts identify and treat COVID-19 cases, trace potential exposures and better protect public health," California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.</p>
<p>Some testing kits initially sent to state and local labs were flawed, delaying their ability to test for the virus.</p>
<p>"This has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked," Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Friday.</p>
<p>Guidelines for who should be tested were broadened by the CDC earlier this week after the first case of unknown origin emerged in California.</p>
<p>Initial guidance called for testing only if a patient had a travel history to China or had been in close contact with someone who had been there, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said.</p>
<p>The Solano County patient now in serious condition wasn't initially tested at UC Davis or the Northern California hospital she was transferred from because she did not fit the CDC criteria for testing at the time.</p>
<p>"As soon as that case was recognized, we met and we revised our case definition for persons under investigation," Redfield said.</p>
<p>The guidance was updated on the CDC's website Thursday.</p>
<p>"Today that has been posted along with a new health advisory that the recommendation should be when a clinician or individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus."</p>
