<h1>Analysis: After years of retooling, Steelers finally have game-changers at linebacker</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Fifth in a 2020 offseason series breaking down the Steelers position by position:</em></p>
<p>The Steelers defense is most effective when the outside linebackers are their dominant pass rushers. It’s not just the sacks; it’s the strip-sack fumbles and hurries that lead to interceptions.</p>
<p>Keith Butler, who is entering his sixth season as defensive coordinator, had it all working last season when the Steelers led the league in sacks and turnovers, two forces that led to the defense emerging once again as one of the NFL’s top units.</p>
<p>Outside linebackers T.J. Watt and Bud Dupree were two of the biggest reasons for the surge back to the top of the pack. They provided pressure in spades in 2019.</p>
<p>Watt and Dupree combined for 26 sacks, more than any Steelers linebacker duo since James Harrison and LaMarr Woodley had 27½ sacks between them in 2008.</p>
<p>As a result of that pressure, the Steelers defense began to draw comparisons to some of the dominant defenses from eras of Steelers past. They had the third-ranked pass defense in the league and were fifth in points against and total yards allowed.</p>
<p>Watt, who was a finalist for NFL defensive player of the year, had a career-high 14½ sacks. Dupree also posted a career-high 11½ sacks.</p>
<p>The Steelers want to keep their pass-rushing tandem in place for at least one more year, which is why they are expected to place the franchise tag on Dupree sometime between now and Monday, the deadline for players to be tagged. If the Steelers can’t come to terms on a long-term contract with Dupree before training camp begins they’ll pay him somewhere in the neighborhood of $16 million on a one-year deal.</p>
<p>Watt, who is under team control for two more years, is a candidate to receive a new contract either this summer or next.</p>
<p>It would be a big upset if the Steelers did not tag Dupree. From the very onset of this offseason the Steelers were intent on keeping their dynamic duo together for one more season as team president Art Rooney, general manager Kevin Colbert and head coach Mike Tomlin took turns saying he was a “priority.”</p>
<p>The uptick in outside linebacker production last season was a long time in the making. The Steelers drafted Dupree in the first round of the draft in 2015 and Watt in the first round in 2017. This, after, Jarvis Jones failed to make an impact as a first-round pick in 2013.</p>
<p>They’ve poured valuable resources into the position, and now that they are reaping benefits, they’d like to keep it going.</p>
<p>The remaking of the linebacker corps took another big step last spring when the Steelers drafted inside linebacker Devin Bush, who gave a peek at his big play-making potential in his rookie season. He led the team in tackles and had two interceptions, one forced fumble and four fumble recoveries, one of which was returned for a touchdown. The Steelers are expecting even more from Bush in his second season because he was learning on the job in his first season.</p>
<p>Mark Barron, signed as a free agent last March, also had a key role in the defense, playing 766 snaps (second-most behind Bush among inside linebackers) while contributing 82 tackles, three sacks, an interception and a fumble recovery.</p>
<p>The Steelers leaned on Barron in passing situations. Oftentimes, he was the only inside linebacker on the field when they wanted to play with extra defensive backs. Barron struggled at times in coverage, but he was the best option to play in that role. In time, Bush is expected to take on more of those responsibilities in pass coverage, which is why Barron’s $8.1 million cap hit in 2020 has been scrutinized.</p>
<p>Bush played 82% of the defensive snaps as a rookie. If he develops into an every-down linebacker in 2020, Barron’s role will diminish.</p>
<p>Speaking of diminishing roles, veteran Vince Williams played his fewest snaps since the 2016 season. He was on the field for only 36% of the defensive snaps as he gave way to Bush and Barron.</p>
<p>Williams remains a very solid as a run-stopper and as a pass rusher, but his $7 million cap hit also is a bit bloated for a part-time player.</p>
<p>The one part of the Steelers defense that struggled at times was their run defense, and a proven tackler like Williams remains valuable, especially given the success running teams in the AFC had last season. And those teams – the Ravens, Bills and Titans – are on the schedule four times, or 25% of the 2020 season.</p>
<p>Williams and Barron will turn 31 during the season, meaning the Steelers are going to have to find replacements in the near future.</p>
<p>The Steelers have some other decisions to make with their reserves. Tyler Matakevich will become an unrestricted free agent next week. He’s been mostly a special-teams player since arriving as a seventh-round pick in 2016, but he is a top reserve inside, too. Ulysees Gilbert’s rookie season ended on injured reserve due to a back injury, but he flashed as a special-teams player early in the season. He also has some potential to play on passing downs if he can develop.</p>
<p>Anthony Chickillo, the top reserve outside linebacker, is a candidate to be released because the Steelers can save $5 million by cutting him. They have Ola Adeniyi and Tuzar Skipper ready to play bigger roles next season. They signed Skipper to a two-year contract in early January.</p>
<p>If all four starters are back in the fold for 2020, it’s fair to expect another exemplary season from the linebackers. They can worry about replacements for Dupree, Barron and possibly Williams in 2021.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the linebackers will be at the forefront of what the Steelers hope can be a championship-caliber defense.</p>
