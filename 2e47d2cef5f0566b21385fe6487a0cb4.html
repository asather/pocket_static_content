<h1>Lightning strikes down Penguins' short winning streak </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>TAMPA, Fla. – It was just one of those nights for the Penguins, the kind we saw often in their lost 2018-19 but have been few and far between this season.</p>
<p>Three plays, all coming in the game’s first 30 minutes, sum up Thursday’s 4-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning, their fifth straight loss here at Amalie Arena.</p>
<p>At one point, Sidney Crosby danced around a defender then turned down a shot from the slot to force a pass to a teammate who wasn’t in scoring position.</p>
<p>Late in the first period, with the Penguins already down two goals, Evgeni Malkin foolishly tried to flip a pass through a pair of legs that was picked off. Then Patric Hornqvist hauled down a Lightning player, ending their power play early.</p>
<p>And then there was the breakaway by Braydon Coburn of all people that Matt Murray had to shut down after a bad giveaway at the Lightning blue line.</p>
<p>The Penguins, as they typically do, made things interesting in the second half of the game. But in the end, a two-goal deficit was too much to overcome against a Lightning team that is again among the top teams in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>“We were on our heels. They were tougher than us. They were faster than us. They were all over, winning the battles,” Marcus Pettersson said. “We had a terrible first period and I think we came back during the second and the third and battled hard. But we can’t give them two goals in the first like we did.”</p>
<p>The Penguins on a few occasions were guilty of over-passing the puck looking for tic-tac-toe plays. They spent too much time in the box against one of the NHL’s top power plays and didn’t do much with the ones they got. And they allowed too many odd-man rushes, one area where they are much better this season.</p>
<p>The Lightning took a 1-0 lead 9:04 into the first period when Mikhail Sergachev’s shot from the point hit a stick then hopped between the legs of Murray. The goal came after the fourth line iced the puck and had to remain on the ice. Moments later, Steven Stamkos finished off a pretty passing play on a 2-on-1 rush.</p>
<p>If not for a textbook half-butterfly save by Teddy Blueger in the Penguins crease with Murray down and out, they would have trailed, 3-0, after one period.</p>
<p>“They just came out a little bit hungrier, a little bit more determined, a little bit more disciplined. … They had a really good first period,” Bryan Rust said.</p>
<p>Hornqvist banked one in off of Malkin’s shin pad midway through the second period. But seconds later the Penguins gave up a 3-on-1 rush. Anthony Cirelli pinged a shot off the left pipe and in to quickly restore the Lightning’s two-goal lead.</p>
<p>“I think when we got down 2-0, we defensemen kind of sold the farm a little bit. We made a few hope plays. That gave them odd-man rushes,” Pettersson said. “We need to play tighter, too. I think we gave them way too much time.”</p>
<p>Murray started his second game in a row. He stopped 29 shots in Sunday’s 4-3 win against the Washington Capitals in what was perhaps his best performance since October. But his six-game winning streak got snapped Thursday.</p>
<p>He wasn’t the problem on this night. He kept the Penguins in the game by making 25 saves, including a pair of big ones on Lightning breakaways.</p>
<p>“He was awesome,” Pettersson said.</p>
<p>With the Penguins reeling, coach Mike Sullivan tried to spark them by playing Crosby, Malkin and Rust together. Kris Letang and Justin Schultz were partnered up, too. And Sullivan shortened their bench, essentially rolling three lines.</p>
<p>It worked. The Penguins had the Lightning on their heels during the third. And early in that period, John Marino made it 3-2, scoring his fifth goal of the season after Malkin found the rookie blue-liner alone in front during 4-on-4 action.</p>
<p>Marino exited the game later in the third period after taking a slap shot to the cheek. He survived it relatively unscathed, only needing stitches, per a source.</p>
<p>The Penguins, who went 0-for-7 on the power play in Sunday’s win against the Capitals, couldn’t capitalize on any of their five opportunities. That included one minute and 34 seconds of a 5-on-3 while down a goal in the third period.</p>
<p>“I just think we’ve got to be better. We’ve got to execute. We’ve got to make better decisions. We’ve got to shoot the puck when we get an opportunity,” Sullivan said. “I thought we had some looks 5-on-4. You’d like to see us score when we get that 5-on-3 opportunity. That’s an important point in the game.”</p>
<p>The Penguins came oh-so close to tying it on that late 5-on-3. But Rust put a shot off the post and Crosby couldn’t whack the rebound past Andrei Vasilevskiy.</p>
<p>“Rusty hits the post there,” Crosby said. “If it goes in, maybe it’s a different story.”</p>
<p>Reigning MVP Nikita Kucherov scored an empty-netter to put the game away.</p>
<p>The Penguins will get a rematch Tuesday at PPG Paints Arena. First, they must wrap up their three-game road trip Saturday against the Florida Panthers.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we can look ahead to that,” Rust said. “Florida’s a really good team. They’ve been doing some really good things and scoring a lot of goals.”</p>
