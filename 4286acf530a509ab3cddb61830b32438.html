<h1>Another 29 test positive for COVID-19 at Bloomsburg U.; Penn State reports 28 new infections</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bloomsburg University on Friday reported another 29 students have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing to 119 the total logged by the state university that a day earlier moved fall classes online after cases doubled in two days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Penn State University reported Friday that 28 students there had tested positive in the past week, all on the main University Park campus except for a single case at Penn State Behrend in Erie. It brought the university’s total to 31 cases since Aug. 7, according to Penn State’s&nbsp;<a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMzM0ZDQyNTMtNTUxYS00ODEzLTk4YzAtZTc4ZjMyNGQ4YjJkIiwidCI6IjdjZjQ4ZDQ1LTNkZGItNDM4OS1hOWMxLWMxMTU1MjZlYjUyZSIsImMiOjF9" target="_blank">COVID-19 dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>The 27 positive results at University Park were out of 4,180 tests administered during the week. There were 2,923 negatives, and 1,230 results are not yet in, according to data from the university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At Bloomsburg, university spokesman Thomas McGuire confirmed that a fraternity, Sigma Iota Omega, hosted a large Friday night party in town. He said the chapter has been placed on interim suspension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Bloomsburg President Bashar Hanna cited the party as having exceeded state limits on gathering size implemented to slow the pandemic’s spread. He said it and other recent gatherings at which individuals flouted mask and social distancing practices potentially were jeopardizing the university’s reopening.</p>
<p>Mr. McGuire told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Thursday, “It is plausible that the large social gatherings by students contributed to the increase in positive cases, but we have no data to confirm it.”</p>
<p>On Friday he added,&nbsp;“Any student cited and convicted for violating local ordinances and state or federal laws is also subject to a student code of conduct hearing. ... Student organizations are also subject to our student code of conduct process if a violation is found.”</p>
<p>A representative of the fraternity could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Bloomsburg officials have not said how many of the individuals who tested positive are showing symptoms of the virus.&nbsp;“I don’t have that data,” Mr. McGuire said.</p>
<p>Earlier, he said officials did not have any information about pattern of spread.</p>
<p>The university’s<a href="https://bloomu.edu/coronavirus" target="_blank"> COVID-19 dashboard</a>&nbsp;said that among students testing positive,&nbsp;20 are on campus, 90 off campus and eight isolated at home. It did not specify the status of the one employee who earlier tested positive and was isolating.</p>
<p>The university of nearly 8,700 students is one of 14 belonging to the State System of Higher Education.&nbsp;Earlier this summer, the campuses developed plans to reopen, but most shifted the brunt of instruction to remote classes as COVID-19 cases spiked.</p>
<p>Fall classes at Bloomsburg began&nbsp; Aug. 17, according to the school’s website. The university said Thursday that students already moved into residence halls would not have to leave since a number are from communities without reliable internet and may not have the needed support to attend remotely. Those who opt to leave would be offered applicable refunds.</p>
<p>Mr. Hanna said most students have followed the rules intended to keep students, employees and the community safe.</p>
<p>But he said a subset had not and the fraternity gathering was being investigated by the university and by police.</p>
<p>“The actions of these few put all of you in jeopardy, and more important, put your safety in jeopardy and also put your education in question,” he said in a video message earlier this week. “I understand college is a fun time, but these are not normal times.”</p>
<p>Penn State officials earlier said <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/07/30/University-of-Pittsburgh-Pitt-Penn-State-fall-COVID19-football-testing-Gallagher-online/stories/202007300137" target="_blank">there are 400 single rooms in the Eastview Terrace buildings</a> that can be used, if needed, for isolation housing on the University Park campus of nearly 50,000 students. Bloomsburg said it has a limited number of isolation beds available, too.&nbsp;</p>
