<h1>Steelers ‘making plans’ to hold training camp at Heinz Field</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the NFL announced last week that all 32 teams would be forced to stay home for training camp this summer due to concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, it was widely assumed that meant UPMC Rooney Sports Complex on the South Side for the Steelers.</p>
<p>After all, that’s where they practice during the season, and it serves as team headquarters on every day but game day. As it turns out, they also plan on making their game day home their training camp site.</p>
<p>“The Steelers are making plans to hold their 2020 Training Camp at Heinz Field,” the team’s director of communications, Burt Lauten, tweeted Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>It might make more sense from a social distancing perspective, considering the team shares its practice facility with the Pitt football program. They occupy separate halves of the building space at 3200 South Water Street, and even practice on separate fields — the complex has four total outdoor fields, two for each team, plus an indoor facility — but neither the Steelers nor Panthers would hardly be sequestered in such a training camp scenario.</p>
<p>With many of Pitt’s players returning to campus and resuming voluntary offseason activities this week, both teams must proceed as if their training camps will begin as scheduled in late July/early August. Pitt usually carries more than 100 players on its camp roster, and the Steelers have a 90-man roster, as well, until cut-down day before the regular season begins.</p>
<p>Couple that with a memo the NFL and its players’ union reportedly sent to teams Monday outlining procedures for re-opening facilities, and the Steelers may have shifted their alternative plans into high gear. The memo from the league includes protocols for testing, screening, and preventing infection with regard to COVID-19, and one such measure to be taken is an effort to keep players 6 feet apart. That likely would mean redesigned locker rooms, meeting rooms, weight rooms and even cafeteria spaces.</p>
<p>Another benefit to Heinz Field is that there are four locker rooms there, giving the Steelers — and their full complement of players — more room to spread out as they go through three or four weeks of a training camp that they’ll attempt to keep as standard as possible.</p>
