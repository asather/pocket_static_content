<h1>Fishing Report: Low, warm waters mostly unproductive, except at night</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Lake Erie</strong> (Erie County) Walleye continued to favor the deeper contours. Anglers reported catches at 40-50 feet in 60-75 feet of water. Drifting in shallower water was generally unproductive, but trolling with the wind west of Walnut Creek worked. Successful anglers adapted to conditions and changed baits and positions often.</p>
<p><strong>Pymatuninng Reservoir</strong> (Crawford County) Walleye went for crawler harnesses and spinners drifted just off the bottom. Midsize yellow perch were caught using midsize minnows under floats fished over brush and submerged fish structures. In hot summer weather, the panfish bite was slow.</p>
<p><strong>Conneaut Lake</strong> (Crawford County) Largemouth bass were taken on soft plastic lures. Panfish were not present at typical deep-water summer feeding stations.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny Reservoir</strong> (Warren County) In cooler, deeper waters, smallmouths took soft plastics and crankbaits. Despite water releases at the dam, Northern pike were caught on spinners in the bays and walleye were taking spinners, spoons and crawler harnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Warren, Venango countie) At least one legal muskie and several sub-legals were caught and released by anglers using live bait or trolled spinners below the Kinzua outflow. Northerns took weedless lures tossed into grass and crankbaits fished over submerged structure.&nbsp;Low, warm and clear water in Venango slowed much of the fishing, but smallmouths were taken on topwater lures at night.</p>
<p><strong>Shenango River</strong> (Mercer County) Despite the heat and low water, crappies were caught at about 15 feet, mostly in the morning. Evening anglers reported hybrid striped bass taken.</p>
<p><strong>Keystone Power Dam</strong> (Armstrong County) Water at the hydroelectric impoundment was low as a result of practically no precipitation and chutes being opened to power heavy use of air conditioners. Some launches were virtually useless and normally shallow bays were reduced to hundreds of yards of mud.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Allegheny County) Catfish continued to come for Tommy Lippert of the North Side, a veteran of Venture Outdoorâ€™s North Shore fishing program. On Wednesday at TriAnglers, Mr. Lippert landed a 26-incher taken on chicken liver. The free program meets 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on the wharf below the Clemente Bridge. Rods, tackle and live bait are provided; license and harvest regulations apply. For details and special COVID-19 registration requirements, go to ventureoutdoors.org or call 412-255-0564.</p>
<p><strong>Indian Lake</strong> (Westmoreland County) Kids caught bluegills using live bait under bobbers.</p>
<p><strong>Loyalhanna Creek</strong> (Westmoreland County) Like most streams throughout the region, Loyalhanna was too low and warm to target trout without jeopardizing their safety.</p>
<p><strong>Monongahela River</strong> (Washington County) With water temperatures dropping into the 70s, baitfish were gathering at tributary mouths and attracting big flathead catfish. Several cats in the 30-pound range were taken on small bluegills and other live bait.</p>
<p><strong>Quemahoning Reservoir</strong> (Somerset County) Waters were 4 feet below normal. Small walleye and a few bass were reported.</p>
