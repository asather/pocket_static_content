<h1>ACC commissioner John Swofford set to retire</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner John Swofford is retiring after the 2020-21 academic year, ending his tenure after 24 years.</p>
<p>Swofford, 71, has been commissioner of the ACC since 1997, the longest run in that position in the history of the 67-year-old conference.</p>
<p>The former North Carolina athletic director took over as commissioner of a nine-team league. In the years that followed, Swofford directed the league through multiple waves of expansion that first turned the ACC into a 12-team league by 2005 and ultimately reach 15 teams by 2013.</p>
<p>The conference also launched its own network last August, a project that Swofford spent years pursuing as the league hoped to close a growing financial gap with its power-conference peers.</p>
