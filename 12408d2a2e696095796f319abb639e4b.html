<h1>Execution warrant signed for Washington County man who killed ex-girlfriend in 2012</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections Secretary John Wetzel has signed an execution warrant for a Washington County man who was sentenced to death in 2015 for killing his estranged girlfriend.</p>
<p>A notice for 31-year-old Jordan Clemons’ execution was signed Monday and is set for March 13, prison records show. The execution likely won’t take place due to a moratorium issued by Governor Tom Wolf in 2015, however.&nbsp;A total of 470 warrants have been signed to date in the state — basement torture killer Gary Heidnik was the last person put to death by lethal injection in 1999.</p>
<p>Majority of death row inmates are held at the state prison in Greene County.</p>
<p>A jury in 2015 unanimously sentenced Clemons to death for slashing the throat of Karissa Kunco and abandoning his ex-girlfriend’s body in January 2012. Ms. Kunco’s naked body was found that day along Sabo Road in Mount Pleasant, covered in debris and leaves.</p>
<p>She died the day before when her neck was slashed.</p>
