<h1>Police investigating shooting death in New Kensington</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police are investigating after a Westmoreland County man was found shot to death Wednesday evening in the front seat of a car outside a housing complex in New Kensington.</p>
<p>New Kensington Police Chief Robert Deringer said 31-year-old Anthone C. Williams, of Arnold, was found just before 5:30 p.m. Wednesday sitting in the driver seat of a BMW in the 200 block of Dent Drive, right outside apartment complex East Ken Manor.</p>
<p>Officers unsuccessfully attempted CPR, but he was pronounced dead at the scene by Deputy Coroner Joshua C. Zappone, according to the Westmoreland County coroner’s office.</p>
<p>“They [medics] ran a strip on his heart, but his heart had no activity,” Chief Deringer said Thursday. The coroner’s office said Williams died from multiple gun shots while sitting in his car.</p>
<p>The portion of the housing complex where Williams was found — which is operated by the Westmoreland Housing Authority — has been vacant for a few years, the police chief said.</p>
<p>“There are no leads in the investigation so far,” he said. “We are interviewing multiple people in the area. The county is processing the vehicle at a local impound and officers are looking into different avenues for suspects.” The BMW is registered to Williams’ girlfriend, who also shared a home with him, the chief said.</p>
<p>Anyone with information regarding this investigation should contact the New Kensington Police Department or Westmoreland police.</p>
