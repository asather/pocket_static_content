<p>Michelle Kenney is still getting used to the spotlight.</p>
<p>In fact, she says she may never fully adjust to the attention she now attracts.</p>
<p>Ms. Kenney said she only ever wants to fight for her son, Antwon Rose II, who was <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/michael-rosfeld-trial-antwon-rose/" target="_blank">shot and killed by an East Pittsburgh police officer in June 2018</a>.</p>
<p>So even almost two years to the date of Antwon’s death, as she typed up a Facebook post decrying President Donald Trump’s claim that he met with her and other families of victims who have died at the hands of police, she said she was only looking to tell her truth.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump said in his Rose Garden signing ceremony Tuesday, in which he <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/06/16/Trump-signs-executive-order-on-police-reform/stories/202006160134" target="_blank">approved an executive order</a> that encouraged better police practices, that he had just concluded a meeting with&nbsp;“incredible families” and went on to mention Antwon by name.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Ms. Kenney wrote on Facebook “I am not in the White House, I chose not to meet their president!”</p>
<p>After her words garnered national attention, Ms. Kenney said Wednesday that just she wanted to set the record straight while also recognizing the families who were actually in attendance.</p>

<p>“I was grateful that he repeatedly mentioned Antwon’s name. I don’t want anyone to misunderstand that,” she said.&nbsp;“Because in doing so, it will get people to look at Antwon’s story and see how messed up things are. I want the world to know about my son.</p>
<p>“But in the same breath,” she continued, “I would hope that the president would not only look at these stories but get to know these people and you would actually know what the mothers of these victims look like. If you were truly invested in making change, you would know who you were talking to.”</p>
<p>White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews later clarified Mr. Trump’s comments in a statement saying the president “referenced some of the families represented by Lee Merritt,” the federal civil rights attorney for the families George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery.</p>
<p>“While Antwon Rose’s family was not in attendance, today the President heard the devastating stories of many families who lost loved ones,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Although Ms. Kenney was not at the White House, she was in Washington D.C. this week to meet with U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., about the Senate Republicans’ package on police reform.</p>
<p>Ms. Kenney said she voiced her opinion on changes she would like to see in the Republican’s bill while advocating for a crackdown on use of force and pushing for legislation that would require police departments to register officer misconduct in a database.</p>
<p>She said she has been backing such <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2020/06/03/Pennsylvania-police-reform-bills-Antwon-Rose-death-officer-George-Floyd-protests/stories/202006030067" target="_blank">legislation on the state level</a> ever since Antwon’s death at the hands of Michael Rosfeld, who shot the unarmed 17-year-old as he was running away from a traffic stop. Five months before the shooting, Mr. Rosfeld was fired from the University of Pittsburgh after he was accused of unjustly detaining two men. He was sworn in as an East Pittsburgh police officer the day he shot Antwon.</p>
<p>“I have been pushing for a registry that keeps track of officers that are fired, discharged, or reprimanded for any bad behavior or misconduct on the job,” Ms. Kenney said.&nbsp;“Had that have been done, Rosfeld wouldn’t have been in East Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Mr. Rosfeld was acquitted of homicide by a jury in March 2019.</p>
<p>As the two-year anniversary of Antwon’s death approaches, Ms. Kenney said her family and community organizers have planned events to celebrate her son’s life. Antwon died on June 19 which also marks Juneteenth, the holiday that commemorates the ending of slavery in the U.S.</p>
<p>Ms. Kenney said the irony of the two events colliding is not lost on her.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t want to lose my son on any day of the week, any day of the year. But the irony of him being murdered on Juneteenth never goes past me,”&nbsp;she said. “It always stays fresh in my mind.”</p>
<p>On Friday at 10 a.m. there will be a balloon release ceremony in East Pittsburgh where the shooting occurred. Ms. Kenney said she also wants to reveal a billboard that she dedicated to Antwon that sits on Route 30, the highway he was running towards when he attempted to flee the traffic stop.</p>
<p>Following the ceremony,&nbsp;Feed the Hood Pittsburgh, the Hill Consensus Group, The Wellness Collective, and Penn Hills Red Phoenix will be hosting a&nbsp;“Feed the Hood” food drive in Hawkins Village, Antwon’s neighborhood, from 3 p.m.-5 p.m.</p>
<p>Ms. Kenney said she hopes that the president’s executive order will put pressure on lawmakers in Pennsylvania to take similar action towards police reform. In the meantime, she recognizes the power of her own platform and wants to use it to continue to honor Antwon’s legacy.</p>
<p>“The only reason I am doing all of this is because what happened to my son was wrong and this has now become my life, my daughter’s life and my family’s life. … All I am doing is being Antwon’s mom. I am going to continue to fight for him because that’s exactly what I did when he was alive.”</p>
