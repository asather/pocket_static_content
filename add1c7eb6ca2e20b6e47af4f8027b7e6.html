<h1>‘Disillusioned’ Dems should abandon party and back Trump, Parnell urges in RNC address</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last October, before he had come to his final decision on whether to run for Congress in Western Pennsylvania, Sean Parnell garnered a public endorsement from the Republican Party's ultimate standard-bearer: President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>On Monday night, Mr. Parnell got to officially return the favor from the main stage of the Republican National Convention, urging "disillusioned" Democrats — during a livestreamed address — to abandon their party and back the president's bid for four more years in the White House.</p>
<p>Mr. Parnell, who is running to unseat incumbent U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, framed the modern-day Democratic Party as one that's "bloated with contempt for Middle America" and desires "conformity" instead of freedom for its voters.</p>
<p>Republicans, Mr. Parnell insisted, will gladly take those voters under their tent.</p>
<p>"It doesn’t matter what you look like, who you love, how you worship, your gender or your job,” Mr. Parnell said. “If you are a traditional Democrat who has become disillusioned with how radical your party has become, then stand with us. You are most welcome.”</p>
<p>Warning that Democrats have become too radical has been a staple of Mr. Parnell's campaign, though he's often sought to link his opponent, Mr. Lamb, to the idea.</p>
<p>But he did not mention Mr. Lamb by name on Monday, and instead used the platform to criticize the Democratic Party at large — including its presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden — for "[turning] against the very people it professed to represent."</p>
<p>Mr. Parnell also spoke about his service as an Army Ranger during the war in Afghanistan, recounting a specific incident in which he said his platoon was attacked by "hundreds of Taliban."</p>
<p>"I was wounded three times in the fighting," he said in his speech. "Nearly all of my platoon was wounded within the first minute. But the enemy kept coming."</p>
<p>It was when he returned to the U.S., he said, that he saw the Democratic Party change.</p>
<p>Though he only spoke for about five minutes, Mr. Parnell cited just one specific example of the Democrats' perceived radical shift: when Mr. Biden "spit venom at an auto worker who dared to question [his] intent to dismantle the Second Amendment and take your guns."</p>
<p>Mr. Parnell was referencing a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden-guns/biden-snaps-at-michigan-auto-worker-over-guns-curses-at-him-idUSKBN20X2NG" target="_blank">March exchange</a> between Mr. Biden and a Michigan man — captured on video — in which the Democrat told the worker he was "full of [expletive]" and said he would only take away his AR-15s. Mr. Biden's platform on guns, according to <a href="https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/" target="_blank">a policy paper</a>, includes “banning] the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines” and buying back those that are already in the community.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has "advanced freedom — despite savage political attacks — to overcome the agenda of the radical left," Mr. Parnell said in his remarks.</p>
<p>With his speech, Mr. Parnell became the first — and last — Republican from Pennsylvania to speak during the RNC’s primetime slate this week.</p>
