<h1>Fun for for all ages at the Pennsylvania Farm Show -- even the city slickers</h1>

<p>HARRISBURG — After a few hours at the 2020 Pennsylvania Farm Show, you might start thinking that “farming could be the life for me.”</p>
<p>That is the effect of immersing yourself in all things related to agriculture, livestock and pasture management with people who love it. Farmers, ranchers, livestock, tractors and cowboys on horseback give the 104th show at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex &amp; Expo Center in Harrisburg its authentic ambiance.</p>
<p>The animals offer the aroma.</p>
<p>“As the week goes on, they get riper,” a veteran of the show noted.</p>
<p>This year, the show runs from 8 a.m. through 9 p.m. until Saturday. It’s free to the public, but parking is $15.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tammy Diehl and her 17 year-old daughter, Kassandra, drove 3½&nbsp;hours from their Hill Acres Farm in Tyler, Clearfield County, to show Kassandra’s pure-bred registered Maintainer calf, Piper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“She wants the calf to be seen because she wants to breed her,” Tammy Diehl explained.</p>
<p>Piper is such a cute, fuzzy little calf that she had visitors questioning their diets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some guy walked by, and he looked over at Piper and said, ‘Going to these shows every year makes me never want to eat a hamburger again,’ ” Kayla Grosser, who came from Virginia to support her cousin Kassandra, said, laughing.</p>
<p>This kind of passion for the animals and the farm life starts early.</p>
<p>Tucker Kresge, 3, was scooping up after a little calf named Sweet Red Wine. He was with his parents Ryan and Becky, of Kresge Farms. They were with Becky Kresge’s sister-in-law, Jennifer Smith, and her son Gideon, 5, who was leading Sweet Red Wine to her grooming spot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is their life, and they love it,” Mrs. Kresge said of the very capable little boys.&nbsp;“My brother and I grew up on a farm.”</p>
<p>She and her brother now each have their own farm.</p>
<p>Ten-year-old Ella Latshaw, of Cambria County, was at the show for the first time with her mother, Casey. Ella was showing her shorn crossbred lamb, Bella.</p>
<p>The next generation of farmers was everywhere — from the shorn-sheep showing to the poultry showmanship contest to the Pennsylvania High School Rodeo Association Championship, which filled the New Holland Arena.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a meet-and-greet session, smaller children tried their hand at roping with the help of the more accomplished teens. Sarah Varner, 13, of Collegeville, Montgomery County, was competing in the rodeo.</p>
<p>“My Pop-pop was a dairy farmer, and when my dad got it he turned it into a Christmas tree farm,” she said. “But five years ago, my sister got a horse and we all started riding.”</p>
<p>In the equine arena, border collies — and their owners — were showing off their skills for the judges.&nbsp; In the main hall, children were digging in rich loam for root vegetables. In the food court — back by the tractor display — a sandbox filled with corn kernels was better than a ball pit.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of free fun for kids and adults at the Farm Show,” said Camp Hill resident Jessica O’Leary, who was with her husband, Dan.</p>
<p>She has been coming since she was a child and now brings her children, Lucy and Claire.</p>
<p>“We look forward to it every year,” she said. “Parking can be a headache, but it’s worth it if you plan on spending the day.”</p>
<p>One thing that is a must-see each year is the butter sculpture, which sits just inside the main hall entrance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Sports Mascots — East Meets West” was churning up interest as the theme for this year’s buttery masterpiece.&nbsp;The Pittsburgh Steelers’ Steely McBeam was was depicted along with the Philadelphia Eagles’ Swoop and the Philadelphia Flyers’ Gritty. So spread the news about this 1,000-pound, marvel created by artists Marie Pelton and Jim Victor.</p>
<p>Each day, a schedule of the events, contests and informative talks and demonstrations is posted. New this year are a craft beer competition and a mounted archery contest.</p>
<p>After you have had your fill of the animals, you can spend time in line in the food court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The $5 milkshakes are a big draw. The line moves quickly, but the lines for hot dogs, cheese steaks, chicken burgers and more are longer, depending on what time of day you decide to get a bite.&nbsp;Food stands are located throughout the complex, not just at the food court.</p>
