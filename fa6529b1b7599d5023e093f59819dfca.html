<h1>Duquesne man pleads guilty in violent 2017 drug deal robbery in Cranberry</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A gunman who won a new trial in connection with the violent robbery of a marijuana dealer in Cranberry in 2017 elected not to go trial and entered a guilty plea Monday to shooting the man during the drug deal.</p>
<p>Kahlil Shelton of Duquesne pleaded to possession and discharge of a gun in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense and will be headed to prison in the summer.</p>
<p>Shelton had already been sentenced to 16 years for the robbery of Octavio Marinello on Aug. 7, 2017, during which prosecutors said he shot Marinello in the chest after Shelton and two accomplices stole six pounds of marijuana from Marinello.</p>
<p>One of Shelton's partners, Deron Howell of Swissvale, is serving 42 years for his role in that robbery and a second holdup of four professional video gamers in Lincoln-Lemington about a week earlier.</p>
<p>Shelton, described previously as a "callous" predator by a federal prosecutor, went to trial on multiple gun and drug-related counts with Howell in May 2018 and quickly lost.</p>
<p>But he won a new trial after successfully arguing that a witness's identification of him from a Facebook picture should be suppressed. Shelton and his lawyer had argued that Brandon Cavey, a witness who said he saw Shelton shoot Marinello, had been improperly influenced by a Cranberry detective, Matt Irvin, in identifying Shelton.</p>
<p>After the shooting, Mr. Cavey was sitting next to the detective at the police station as the officer performed tasks on his computer. When the detective pulled up the Facebook page of Shelton's girlfriend, Rayna Oliver, an image of Shelton appeared and Mr. Cavey identified him as the man who had shot Marinello and who had been at his house four days earlier for another drug transaction.</p>
<p>Shelton and his lawyer argued that the detective had suggested to Mr. Cavey that the photo was that of the shooter, which under the law would taint the identification, but U.S. District Judge Arthur Schwab rejected the premise.</p>
<p>"Upon seeing the photo on Detective Irvinâ€™s desk and computer, Mr. Cavey, without any questions being asked of him, serendipitously exclaimed words to the effect that this was one of the individuals who shot his friend," the judge ruled.</p>
<p>He said there was "nothing suggestive whatsoever in the identification process" in that the detective did not prompt Mr. Cavey in any way.</p>
<p>The judge denied the suppression motion on Jan. 7 and a few weeks later Shelton scheduled a plea hearing.</p>
<p>Howell was the planner and Shelton was his muscle in the Cranberry robbery, prosecutors said, which happened a week after Howell and two armed accomplices robbed the video gamers.</p>
<p>Howell had arranged to rip off the gamers, including top-ranked Marcus Carr, when they were in town for a tournament. Howell picked them up from the airport and drove them to Lincoln-Lemington, where two men with AK-47s emerged from an alley and robbed them. The gunmen have not been identified.</p>
<p>A week later, Howell and Shelton arranged to buy pot from Marinello at Brandon Cavey's house in Cranberry. Shelton had visited previously to case the house, Mr. Lanni said.</p>
<p>After Howell, Shelton and another man arrived for the deal, Shelton excused himself to go to the bathroom and emerged with a gun, which he pressed to the heads of Mr. Cavey and Marinello. A 6-year-old also was in the house at the time.</p>
<p>Howell then stole the marijuana, but Marinello put up a fight and Shelton shot him twice, prosecutors said. He survived.</p>
<p>The case was originally handled in state court but the U.S. attorney's office later adopted it, bringing an indictment against Howell, Shelton and Marinello in 2017. Marinello pleaded guilty to a gun charge in 2018 and is awaiting sentencing.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Arthur Schwab said he will sentence Shelton on Aug. 10.</p>
