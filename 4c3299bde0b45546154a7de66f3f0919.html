<h1>PNC sells Blackrock stake for $14.4 billion</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PNC Financial Services Group said Friday it completed the sale of its stake in money manager Blackrock Inc. for some $14.4 billion.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh-based bank sold 31.6 million shares of common and preferred stock through a registered offering at $420 per share. It also sold 2.65 million shares back to Blackrock at $414.96 a share. The bank&nbsp;retained 500,000 shares that it plans to contribute to the PNC Foundation by the end of the second quarter.</p>
<p>PNC announced Monday that it was selling its roughly 22% stake in Blackrock, saying the time was right to unlock the value of the investment. The move gives the bank a large stash of cash that it could use for acquisitions.</p>
<p>PNC CEO William Demchak said Monday that selling the stake would leave the bank&nbsp;“very well-positioned to take advantage of potential investment opportunities that history has shown can arise in disrupted markets.”</p>
<p>During the 2008 financial crisis, PNC took over ailing National City Bank in Cleveland. The fall of the 163-year-old institution was a coup for PNC, transforming this region’s biggest bank into a superpower and one of the top 10 financial institutions in the nation.</p>
