<h1>Regatta operator bankruptcy stalled</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The bankruptcy case involving the operator of the&nbsp;EQT Three Rivers Regatta was thrown into question Monday after the attorney representing deep-in-the-red LionHeart Event Group LLC failed to show up for a meeting before the federal trustee.</p>
<p>The attorney for the Ross-based event firm,&nbsp;Brian C. Thompson, had filed a motion last week seeking a&nbsp;postponement of a meeting of the creditors set for Monday afternoon, citing a scheduling conflict. A prior effort to hold such a meeting had also been postponed.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, though, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Gregory Taddonio denied the postponement request, noting that Mr. Thompson could send another attorney from his firm if he is unavailable. When Mr. Thompson nonetheless failed to show on Monday, and no other attorney signed in on behalf of LionHeart, federal bankruptcy trustee Rosemary C. Crawford noted that it was&nbsp;“the second missed meeting before me” and that it came after a judge had explicitly rejected the postponement request.</p>
<p>“I will be entering on the court docket a rule to show cause why this case should not be dismissed for the principal’s failure to prosecute,” said Ms. Crawford. That means LionHeart’s attorneys will need to lay out arguments for why the case should continue, or face dismissal.</p>
<p>Attorneys for three of LionHeart’s creditors then left without comment. Mr. Thompson could not be reached for comment by phone, and his office staff would not say what had precluded his attendance at the meeting.</p>
<p>Dismissal of the bankruptcy would open up LionHeart to collection efforts by the individual creditors.</p>
<p>The EQT Three Rivers Regatta, a Pittsburgh staple since 1978, was canceled July 30 by its governing nonprofit board after LionHeart failed to get a city permit or liability insurance for the event while also failing to pay vendors for past services.</p>
<p>LionHeart&nbsp;is pursuing liquidation under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, under which the trustee could sell its assets to satisfy creditors.</p>
<p>Court papers filed in recent months suggest that there may not be much to liquidate. They show claims against LionHeart totaling&nbsp;$744,527, versus personal property owned by the firm totaling just $2,265, including lumber, T-shirts, hats, children’s games, banners, inflatable chairs, a laptop, a printer, a generator and various pieces of hardware — but no cash.</p>
<p>Creditors and amounts owed by LionHeart, as of October, included:</p>
<p>[The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is also listed as a creditor, owed $7,500 for “marketing,” according to court filings.]</p>
<p>LionHeart was subcontracted to manage the event since 2017.&nbsp;LionHeart in 2018 had gross revenue of nearly $1.2 million, but that plunged to $549,585 last year through October, according to the filing.</p>
<p>When it canceled the 2019 event, the nonprofit&nbsp;Pittsburgh Three Rivers Regatta Inc., which hired LionHeart, said the firm had not disclosed its financial troubles.</p>
<p>The sheriff’s office has sued LionHeart in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. There has been no movement in that case since August.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, which reported that it is owed $28,000 for security provided in 2017 and 2018, undertook a criminal investigation&nbsp;of the events leading up to regatta cancellation.</p>
<p>In October, city of Pittsburgh responses to a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette right-to-know request revealed that <a title="Regatta GJ" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/10/17/Three-Rivers-Regatta-cancellation-under-grand-jury-investigation-according-to-the-city-Pittsburgh/stories/201910170134" target="_blank">there is a grand jury investigation into the regatta’s collapse.</a></p>
<p>The city refused to release requested records or to provide any information on whether the grand jury is being run by county, state or federal prosecutors.&nbsp;The Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office said then that it is not conducting any such investigation, while the state Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania declined comment.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Three Rivers Regatta Inc.’s last available IRS filing indicated that it had, as of Sept. 30, 2018, around $34,226 in net assets. Attempts to get comment from representatives of the nonprofit on Monday were not successful.</p>
