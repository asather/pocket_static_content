<h1>Pirates trade Starling Marte to Diamondbacks in a move that 'signals rebuild'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Until Monday, new general manager Ben Cherington had been mostly quiet about the Pirates’ overall direction. Now it seems as if the team is going into rebuilding mode under first-year manager Derek Shelton and its new leadership core after trading away one of their best players.</p>
<p>The Pirates dealt outfielder Starling Marte to the Arizona Diamondbacks Monday for two prospects plus international pool money in exchange for the former All-Star. The 31-year-old center fielder is under contract for $11.5 million in 2020. Marte’s contract included a $12.5 million club option and a $1 million buyout option for 2021.</p>
<p>Conventional baseball wisdom would say that trading away a player like Marte for two young prospects means rebuilding is coming. Cherington doesn’t seem to subscribe to such, at least in his conversations with the media.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We’re focused on helping our current players reach their fullest potential and also adding, in whatever ways we can, talent from outside the organization that has the kind of capability to help us win a lot of games and get to a team that’s playing meaningful games in September and October as soon as we possibly can,” Cherington told reporters at PNC Park Monday.</p>
<p>“We just need more talent, and we need to add that to the players we have here with the Pirates already. I’m really confident we have players on our current team and in the minor leagues who will be part of that team I’m describing, and we’re going to keep working hard to build that team.”</p>
<p>Cherington said the Pirates will pay $1.5 million of Marte’s 2020 salary, which leaves about $9.5 million that the team could reinvest into the ballclub.</p>
<p>“I am hopeful that we’ll add to the group in some way before we get to Bradenton,” Cherington said. “I don’t anticipate anything happening in the other direction.”</p>
<p>The last sentence is critical. It appears that, for now, the Pirates won’t trade Adam Frazier or any of the other players mentioned in rumors.</p>
<p>Marte hit 23 home runs, stole 25 bases and hit .295 in 2019. If the Pirates don’t make a move to replace Marte, then they are now looking at a likely starting outfield group of Guillermo Heredia, Bryan Reynolds and (hopefully) Gregory Polanco. Jose Osuna, Jason Martin and Pablo Reyes will be among those who will compete for opportunities in the outfield.</p>
<p>Shortstop Liover Peguero and pitcher Brennan Malone — in addition to $250,000 in international pool money — are headed to the Pirates for Marte.</p>
<p>“We need to add to our talent base,” Cherington said. “And some of that will involve taking some chances on guys, making some bets on guys who are less proven but may have more upside. We have a foundation of talent in Pittsburgh and in our system that we feel will be a key part of our success. We also know that we need more of it if we are going to be able to compete deep into September and October.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cherington made the Marte trade a high priority from the moment he took the job. The new general manager didn’t want to enter spring training with questions about Marte swirling around the squad.</p>
<p>“We weren’t going to do the Marte trade lightly, but this opportunity with the D-backs brought to us two young players who we’re really excited about, who we feel have significant potential and upside,” Cherington said. “Certainly, in the early part of their development curve, but with significant upside, the kind of players that have a chance to make an impact on the Pirates long-term. The third piece, the spending space, allows us hopefully to do something in the international market.”</p>
<p>Peguero 19, is a shortstop who was the fifth-best prospect in the Diamondbacks’ system, according to FanGraphs. The 6-foot-1 Dominican Republic native slashed .326/.382/.485 slash line with 11 steals and five home runs across two minor league levels last season.</p>
<p>“There’s a long way to go and a lot of ground to cover. He’s the type of young player that scouts get excited about and our analysts get excited about,” Cherington said. “He does a bunch of things that good major league players when they were 19, did. We’re excited about that.”</p>
<p>Malone, 19, is a right-hander whom FanGraphs rates as the Diamondbacks’ 10th-best prospect. The Diamondbacks drafted him 33rd overall in 2019, and the power pitcher will likely be one of the top pitching prospects in the Pirates system. Oddly enough, Malone nearly got picked by the Pirates last year. They wound up taking Quinn Priester with the 18th overall pick, instead. Cherington and assistant general manager Steve Sanders also met with the 6-4 pitcher when they were with Toronto.</p>
<p>“He’s got, as far as body type, the physical capability and the delivery traits to be a starting pitcher. He’s got exceptional arm strength and velocity and the makings of good secondary stuff,” Cherington said. “He’s a really good kid. He is a smart and intelligent young man. Again, 19 years old and a long way to go and a lot of work to do. But we’re excited about the ingredients he has that gives him the ability to be a starting pitcher.”</p>
<p>Marte signed with the Pirates in 2007 and made his debut with the big-league club in 2012. He won two Gold Gloves with the Pirates (2015, 2016) and was an All-Star in 2016, when he stole 47 bases and batted .311.</p>
<p>“This move signals rebuild for the Pirates,” an NL West scout told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via text. “If they develop these kids properly, it’ll be a good move similar to the return the Pirates got for trading Andrew McCutchen. Malone has a strong arm and Peguero has a lot of talent. Anytime you get two of top 10 prospects from a team with a system like Arizona is a win.”</p>
