<h1>Greenfield Bridge will close again, three years after it opened</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just three years after the Greenfield Bridge was replaced, it will be closed for a month beginning Monday to replace the deck that was expected to last 50 years or more.</p>
<p>City Engineer Eric Setzler said Tuesday that the city found “a bit of material defect” and “some voids” in some areas of the concrete deck during its final inspection of the bridge before it reopened in October 2017. The city is concerned that the voids will allow water to get under the surface and cause the deck to have problems long before its normal life span, Mr. Setzler said.</p>
<p>“This is something that was not acceptable for the specifications,” Mr. Setzler said. “This is a fairly large issue. It is fairly unusual. That’s why were making sure it gets taken care of.”</p>
<p>Contractor Mosites Construction Co., which couldn’t be reached for comment, will mill off a portion of the entire deck and replace it with 1¼ inches of latex modified concrete to seal the surface at no cost to the city. Crews also will replace the protective coating on the east bridge barrier, where it is flaking and peeling.</p>
<p>Mosites had a $17.5 million contract for the two-year project to replace the bridge that crosses above the Parkway East near the Squirrel Hill Tunnel, joining Greenfield with Schenley Park. Many motorists use the bridge as an alternate route to Oakland to avoid parkway congestion.</p>
<p>The city has been in discussions with the contractor since the problems were discovered.</p>
<p>Mr. Setzler said most of the concrete problems were near the Greenfield end of the bridge but the city wanted the entire deck replaced so the bridge will have a uniform surface.</p>
<p>“We are really committed to getting it done before winter,” Mr. Setzler said. “That’s when the snow can sit there and the water can get inside when it melts.”</p>
<p>City Councilman Corey O’Connor, who represents the district where the bridge is located, said it’s unfortunate the structure will have to be closed again. The good thing is traffic has been lower in recent months due to the CVOID-19 pandemic, he said, and residents will adapt.</p>
<p>“It’s never a good time to close the bridge … but this is as good a time as any,” he said.</p>
<p>Traffic will be detoured via Beechwood Boulevard, Forward Avenue, Murray Avenue and Beacon Street.</p>
<p>The old bridge, opened in 1922, had problems for nearly 20 years with concrete falling onto the highway below to the point that the city installed huge nets and a secondary bridge so vehicles wouldn’t be hit with falling debris. The city closed the parkway for a week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve in 2015 to create a dirt pillow on the highway to protect it when crews imploded the bridge and dropped it to the ground.</p>
