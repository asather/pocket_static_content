<h1>Letters from Pirates Camp: First session at Pirate City produces a hit, fine</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Halfway into my first day of Pirates Fantasy Camp, I broke one cardinal rule, I owe Steve Blass money and my left knee is sore.</p>
<p>Other than that, things are great.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, what an experience this has been thus far. Five hours in, I’ve probably met 30 people, all of them as nice as can be, all of them with terrific stories. We’ve done a lot of things. I’ve seen a lot of stuff. I’ve geeked out. I’ve talked to former Pirates. It’s incredible.</p>
<p>One person I met — and I would imagine I’ll write more about him later in the week — is Beechview native Paul McCann, an 86-year-old catcher. Yes, an 86-year-old catcher. And here I’m complaining about my knee feeling sore. Blass should fine me for that, too.</p>
<p>My morning started in fortunate fashion, which speaks to how friendly the campers are. I’m staying at a Courtyard by Marriott about a 10-minute drive from Pirate City. I was a late registration, and it turns out Pirate City was full. In the lobby this morning I met up three guys, all great friends, who have been coming to fantasy camp for years: Gregg Merlin, 77, from Greensburg; Mark Mansour, 62, from Arlington, Va.; and Jim Fitzgerald, 67, from Plum.</p>
<p>“Are you guys going to fantasy camp?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yep,” Fitzgerald responded. “Want a ride?”</p>
<p>I was amazed to learn is how many veterans are down here — and I don’t mean war veterans. I’m technically a rookie&nbsp;— this is my first camp&nbsp;— and I’m in a thin minority. Most have been coming here for years. They look forward to this week. They have a plan and a story.</p>
<p>“My wife and daughter gave this to me as a surprise birthday present, in August,” Fitzgerald said. “Then I had the rest of the year to prepare. I always tell her, ‘You started this. You gave it to me as a gift. So I’m going to honor you by going every year.’ ”</p>
<p>“It just gets in your system,” Merlin added.</p>
<p>The day started with breakfast in the cafeteria; nervous, I went with small portions of potatoes, bacon, eggs and fruit. (When I’m not playing baseball, I love to have a huge breakfast on the road. But with evaluation games this morning, I figured I should stay light, as Bob Errey likes to say.)</p>
<p>After some opening remarks, Kent Tekulve walked us over to the clubhouse with the rookies leading the way. There, I had my own locker, with black and white jerseys hanging in front.</p>
<p>As sports writers, we do this all the time: staring at empty lockers. I expected this to signify nothing. I was wrong. All of this stuff was mine, my own area. I have neighbors I will get to know throughout the week. It’s a place where people can find me.</p>
<p>Another quirk came when I decided to take a walk around the clubhouse. As a reporter, no matter the sport, there are certain places you can’t go. I found myself having the same concerns this morning, wondering if I can go somewhere, only to laugh and realize that I’m the player.</p>
<p>A highlight came next, when Blass offered his opening address — and he issued me a fine. Because I was not at Saturday’s opening banquet, Blass fined me $1, the proceeds benefiting Pirates Charities. I declined an opportunity to appeal.</p>
<p>A great exchange here involved Alan Scott, a Squirrel Hill native who turned 63 on Sunday. He told Blass about some special moments he’s had at camp with Bill Mazeroski and Bill Virdon and another that occurred this morning with Vernon Law.</p>
<p>“How much have we talked?” Blass said with a wry smile. “Right. Three-dollar fine.”</p>
<p>Next came some stretching and right into batting practice, which kicked my nerves into full gear. Stepping to the plate for the first time, I forgot how foreign it felt. The ball seemed tiny. I hadn’t looked at something so intently in awhile, the way you laser focus on the pitcher, his arm slot and when and where you pick up the baseball.</p>
<p>Just don’t look stupid, I told myself.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I looked stupid, but I certainly didn’t look great. Nubber to second. Dribbler down the third-base line. A couple bloops. Nothing that anyone is going to have any trouble fielding, that’s for sure. Thankfully, it got better. I started to relax and drove a couple to the outfield before my round was done.</p>
<p>The best part of the morning, at least in terms of what I did on the field, involved my first at-bat in the evaluation game. After taking two fastballs for balls, I got one right down the middle and drove it to left center for a double. I finally exhaled. Instead of my hands stinging because I had been making terrible contact, I barely felt this ball.</p>
<p>Running the bases proved a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>In baseball, when running from home to second, there’s a specific way to round first. A simple way to explain it involves a banana. It should be a curve, so you maintain your momentum going to second. Whatever it was that I did was not a banana. Looked more like a piece of celery.</p>
<p>After clumsily chopping my feet and taking about an 85-degree turn toward second, I realized an outfielder had knocked the ball down. There might be a play at second base, I realized. By no fewer than 10 people this morning, I was warned to take it easy in the evaluation game. Everybody gets drafted, they said. Don’t slide or hurt yourself.</p>
<p>Old habits die hard. Down I went, beat the throw, safe. I was thankful my first significant contribution to this camp was getting thrown out by taking a chance, but I broke one of the cardinal rules by sliding, by being that guy.</p>
<p>“Nice slide,” one of my teammates yelled. “Don’t ever do it again.”</p>
<p>My second and final at-bat of the game was less exciting. With a 1-0 count, I got a fastball middle-out. On those pitches, you want to drive them to center or right field, allowing the ball to travel just a hair longer. I got antsy and lunged, the result a harmless pop to the pitcher that triggered the infield fly rule.</p>
<p>• You'll notice that I didn’t pitch in the evaluation game. I didn’t want to force myself out there and actually played two innings in the field, making both plays I had at shortstop.</p>
<p>It generated a funny exchange with Jack Wilson, who told me I shouldn’t pitch because he didn’t want anyone else to see me throw, creating for himself a bit of a sleeper pick. Wilson, I’ve been told, is really competitive at these things.</p>
<p>• Sunday thus far has had a lot of getting-to-know-you sort of stuff. There will be a draft shortly and pictures after that before the first games at 2 p.m. I hope to have more then.</p>
<p>As for my knee, it has nothing to do with the slide. Before my senior year of college, in summer ball, I took a comebacker off the knee, and it cracked my kneecap in half, requiring two surgeries. I run a decent amount, but I experience some occasional discomfort here while moving back and forth.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it started aching a little this morning. I don’t think it’ll be anything significant, but I usually did wear a brace when I played. I might have to find one floating around down here.</p>
<p>• McCann joked that he keeps coming back for the food. At least I think he was joking, because it really is good. Lunch consisted of rice, beans, grilled chicken, garlic shrimp, grilled cheese and tomato soup, all of it excellent, to go along with a salad bar, yogurt and more.</p>
