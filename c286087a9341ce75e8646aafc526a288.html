<h1>Plastic roads: Experimenting with recycled materials</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Americans throw away a lot of plastic each year; about 35 million tons, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and nearly 27 million tons of that waste ends up in landfills.</p>
<p>Imagine if even a portion of that total was used to build roads. There are some promising pilot programs that could lead to so-called “plastic roads” in the not-so-distant future.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical, one of the world’s largest plastic producers, has been experimenting with using recycled plastics in road construction to reduce waste. Last year, the company built two private roads at its Freeport, Texas, facility outside Houston. Although asphalt was still used in the construction, the company said it also used 1,700 pounds of recycled plastic in the process.</p>
<p>It was the first domestic project for the chemical giant, but it had been experimenting with plastic roads as early as 2017 in Indonesia and India. Dow helped two Indian cities — Bangalore and Pune — build roads using more than 100 tons of recycled plastics.</p>
<p>Dow is not alone in the effort to use recycled plastic in building roads. A company in Los Angeles developed a system that uses the plastic found in items such as water bottles to replace bitumen, the material that holds asphalt together. The process involves grinding up the top few inches of asphalt on a street, crushing that material to a specific size, mixing it with the liquid plastic and resurfacing the road with the new material.</p>
<p>The company estimates the roads made with recycled products can last eight to 13 times longer than a traditional road.</p>
<p>That’s not to say we’ll be seeing recycled plastics used in major road construction projects immediately. Dow officials said that while roads made with plastics have been successful in Asian countries, regulations for U.S. roads tend to be stricter and can vary based on the region.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, where terrain and weather are significant factors in road construction, there are no current road projects using recycled plastic. However, PennDOT officials are working with the state Department of Environmental Protection on the feasibility of using recycled plastic to build curb stops and other traffic-control products.</p>
<p>Environmental groups estimate that enough plastic is thrown away each year to circle the Earth four times. Innovative ways to reuse that material — such as building roads out of plastic — should be encouraged.</p>
