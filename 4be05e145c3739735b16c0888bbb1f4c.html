<h1> McKeesport schools hire new business manager </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The McKeesport Area School District will have a new business manager this month.</p>
<p>The board, at a Feb. 26 meeting, unanimously approved the hiring of Joan Wehner as business manager. She was given a five-year contract that runs from March 23 to June 30, 2025, at a salary of $95,000 per year.</p>
<p>She also will serve as the school board secretary and the district’s Right-to-Know officer.</p>
<p>Ms. Wehner is a graduate of McKeesport Area High School and Duquesne University, where she earned a degree in business finance.</p>
<p>She most recently worked in the Penn Trafford School District as its assistant manager.</p>
<p>She takes over for previous business manager Matthew Gergley who resigned in January.</p>
<p>The board also unanimously approved the hiring of Brandy Daye as assistant high school principal at a salary per the district’s Act 93 agreement.</p>
<p>In another matter, the board re-approved an agreement with ABM Building Solutions for a districtwide guaranteed energy savings project in the amount of $11,563,981.</p>
<p>Board members Joe Lopretto, Tom Filotei, Steven Kondrosky, Diane Elias and Jim Poston voted in favor of the project. Mindy Sturgess, James Brown and Mr. Donoto dissented.</p>
<p>At a meeting last year, Tyler Nichols, of ABM, told the board the energy savings from the project would offset the cost.</p>
<p>The agreement had been approved in December, however board member Dave Donoto questioned that approval stating that the dollar amount was not included in the motion.</p>
<p>District solicitor Gary Matta said the approval was done correctly in December, but he said he was fine with re-approving it with the amount.</p>
<p>Work has already begun on the project throughout the district, including the installation of LED lighting. District HVAC equipment is also set to be replaced.</p>
