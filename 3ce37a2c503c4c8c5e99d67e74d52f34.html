<h1>Jason Mackey: Why Mitch Keller’s strong start may have actually mattered</h1>

<p>The result obviously wasn’t good — <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/09/19/Bullpen-spoils-Mitch-Keller-no-hit-bid-in-Pirates-loss-5-4-St-Louis-Cardinals/stories/202009190100" target="_blank">another Pirates loss</a>. But the sizable steps forward Mitch Keller took in his start Saturday, in which he gave Pittsburgh six no-hit innings during a 5-4 loss, were certainly encouraging.</p>
<p>“Mitch was about as good as you could get,” manager Derek Shelton said.</p>
<p>The origin of Keller’s terrific start traces back to his previous one, last Monday in Cincinnati. After Keller’s final inning — the third — he told Shelton that he felt like he found something.</p>
<p>That discussion came up Saturday when Shelton told Keller he had reached his allotted pitch count, and his evening was over.</p>
<p>“I told him in the third inning [against the Reds] that I kind of found it. I was feeling really good and found a rhythm,” Keller said. “Sure enough I came out and had a pretty good start [Saturday], and he came up to me after and was like, ‘Yeah, you were right. You were feeling it.’</p>
<p>“So that was good to hear.”</p>
<p>After about six weeks on the injured list with a left oblique issue, Keller’s start Saturday had a definitive end point, and Shelton said there was absolutely no way he was willing to extend the young pitcher past six innings and 84 pitches.</p>
<p>“It was a hard-and-fast cap,” Shelton said. “It was the first time he had been to six [innings]. Mitch Keller is way too important to the Pittsburgh Pirates ... he wasn’t getting through nine. What did he finish at, 84? For him to go seven innings of a no-hitter, no, it’s not worth it.</p>
<p>“The pitch count is what we talked about before the game. We weren’t going to bounce off it.”</p>
<p>From behind the plate, Jacob Stallings said this was the best he’s seen Keller’s fastball. Dating back to spring training, Keller has been trying to use it more up in the zone. It finally clicked on Saturday, with the right-hander notching four of his six strikeouts with heaters.</p>
<p>Keller and Stallings devised a game plan that included an effective fastball-slider combination to righties, and Keller made that work with some terrific breaking stuff. When Keller’s fastball command waned, he did an excellent job by quickly recalibrating his delivery.</p>
<p>Stallings said he never talked to Keller about the no-hit bid, although Keller admitted that he was well-aware of the unachievable goal he was chasing. Regardless of the outcome — thanks to the bullpen blowing it in the seventh — Keller’s progress is notable for a franchise that will need him to anchor its rotation in 2021.</p>
<p>“I told him before his first start back I was really happy to have him back,” Stallings said. “I really enjoy catching him. I think he’s got a really bright future.”</p>
<p>The fastball usage was the biggest thing to pluck from Saturday’s start. While Keller’s changeup remains a project and his curveball and slider are both elite, the Pirates should hope that what he did against the Cardinals is a repeatable process.</p>
<p>Before the game, Keller and Stallings talked about where the catcher should set up. Keller asked Stallings to adjust his glove placement and his stance, encouraging the pitcher to trust his fastball up in the zone.</p>
<p>This was only Keller’s fourth start of the season, the third he’s finished. He left his second early with the oblique injury that has sidelined him for much of the season.</p>
<p>With only one more start the rest of the way, Keller was looking for something positive to take with him into the offseason, even the tiniest thing that he can use to build on for 2021.</p>
<p>Keller got it with his fastball command and how his aggressiveness with the pitch neutralized the Cardinals’ swings.</p>
<p>Of his 84 pitches, Keller’s fastball generated five whiffs, 11 called strikes, 11 foul balls and eight balls put in play. None, obviously, that went for a hit.</p>
<p>“He was obviously really good,” Stallings said. “He just had a really good fastball, maybe the best I’ve seen since I’ve caught him in terms of where he was locating it and the overall life on it, playing up. The fastball was just really working, and he was obviously able to use the off-speed stuff to get them off the heater and put ‘em away.”</p>
