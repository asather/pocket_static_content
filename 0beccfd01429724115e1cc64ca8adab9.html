<h1>Port Authority will reduce maintenance workers, take temperatures at West Mifflin garage to control COVID-19 virus</h1>

<p>Maintenance workers and bus drivers will find a different atmosphere when they report for work Sunday at Port Authority’s West Mifflin garage as the agency deals with a rash of COVID-19 cases there.</p>
<p>Everyone will enter the facility through the same door, where a temporary employee will take their temperature and send them home if it is above 100.4 degrees. Bus drivers already are on a reduced schedule due to low ridership during the pandemic. Maintenance will have a skeleton crew of about 10 workers each shift instead of 45 because six of the eight positive tests there have been maintenance employees, the most recent one reported Friday night.</p>
<p>CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman said Friday the agency, following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and&nbsp;Prevention, will take temperatures with touchless digital thermometers at the garage for two weeks after the most recent positive test, which was Thursday. And until at least May 7, maintenance workers will do only emergency bus repairs, not routine or scheduled maintenance.</p>
<p>The agency has been working closely with the Amalgamated Transit Union on safety procedures, Ms. Kelleman told the authority board Friday, including cleaning vehicles daily, having riders enter vehicles through the rear door and limiting how many can ride in one vehicle, deep-cleaning the garage after positive tests, and having workers wear masks and gloves. Union President and Business Agent Steve Palonis said earlier this week he was&nbsp;“dumbfounded” by continuing virus cases at the garage.</p>
<p>“We’re also sort of baffled,” authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said Friday.&nbsp;“We’re following all of the procedures.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kelleman told the board the disruption in ridership is having a serious financial impact on the agency, noting it is losing about $15 million a month in passenger revenue and spending $1 million extra each month to clean and sanitize vehicles and stations, which normally is done once a month. The agency is keeping track of those costs and losses so it can apply for reimbursement from $141.7 million earmarked for Port Authority under the federal Covid-19 recovery bill.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelleman said the agency already is planning for how it will operate after the emergency is over. She said she expects to hire more maintenance workers to maintain current cleanliness standards and could&nbsp;“tweak” plans for station improvements, but she stressed that it will continue its goals of improving the riding experience for customers, reducing bus stops to improve on-time performance and developing a long-range plan for service 25 years from now.</p>
<p>“I was brought here to give our region the public transit system it deserves, and the coronavirus will not change that,” she said.</p>
