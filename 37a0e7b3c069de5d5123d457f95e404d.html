<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 02.05.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi folks. Welcome to my weekly Pirates chat. We're getting dangerously close to spring training, which means there's plenty to talk about. Ask your questions now. I'll be back at noon to answer 'em.</p>
<p><strong>Mario</strong>: Hi Jason...In light of the Cole and Marte trades, it’s too bad Nutting didn’t hire Jim Rutherford as he seems to get VALUE for his transactions. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Mario, this is actually a funny thing to think about. I like Cherington and I think he was a smart hire, even if I think people are kinda getting mad right now. But Jim is a big baseball guy. He has always joked with me that it's the one thing he hasn't done in sports that he'd love to try. I think he'd be good at it, too. But I'm not sure Jim's aggressiveness and how Nutting runs the Pirates would make for a terribly good match. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SalemPirate</strong>: The more I think about the upcoming season, I'm thinking what the heck let's start Hayes from the get go. Foolish? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You shouldn't start a young, talented player because you think everybody will stink. Regardless of whether you're right, it's not the right move for Hayes -- who has done nothing wrong here -- to come up before he's ready. Honestly, you can pick apart issues they have, but I think their infield situation isn't terrible. Moran is fine as a stopgap. Newman is terrific piece. Frazier had a good year ... so good that I might trade him. I like Cole Tucker. Again, I just wouldn't force Hayes. His bat will tell us when he's ready.</p>
<p><strong>Ty</strong>: Is Will Craig going to get a shot at the major leauge level this year in a corner outfield spot becuase barring any major set back, he’s a young guy that deserves and has earned a chance. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It depends on the type of spring he has. If he shows he can play out there, yeah. But last year wasn't a terribly great audition, for a few reasons. Craig also needs to find more consistency at the plate; he had a terrible end to the season.</p>
<p><strong>BuccoBill</strong>: I know the names but what is your prediction for opening day rotation <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Musgrove-Williams-Archer-Keller-Brault ... Kuhl and Holland as potential swing guys out of the 'pen.</p>
<p><strong>rs</strong>: Great coverage of your trip to camp last week. Awesome reads. As for the Pirates, I understand trading Marte and building up the minor league system. I am all for "rebuilding" and I want to give new management team the benefit of the doubt. That being said, I am skeptical no matter what the plan is since Mr. Nutting has never proven he is willing to do what it takes to put a championship team on the field. From 2013-2015, fans showed up and were rewarded by a slow dismantling beginning in 2016 leading us to where we sit today. Can you give disappointed and frustrated pirate fans some hope?? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I chatted with Ben Cherington today. Haven't written this, but one of the things Ben said was he believes that they'll eventually be able to increase payroll. My take: I can see Bob Nutting wanting Cherington and others to improve how they draft, sign and develop guys. They should be better with those things than they've been. They should be getting better performance out of the major league club, too. If Derek Shelton can help to achieve that, and Cherington can improve those other things, then Nutting damn well better reciprocate by giving those guys what they need to keep competing. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Also, if you're Ben Cherington -- who is not an idiot and has the World Series rings to prove it -- why on Earth would you come here if you didn't get some sort of assurance, hopefully in writing, that payroll would increase in lockstep to the team's performance?</p>
<p><strong>Ron J</strong>: Hi Jason . I can’t understand how the Pirates can’t lose at least 100 <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think they'll lose 100. I don't even think they'll lose 90. USA Today can predict all it wants, but it doesn't make it gospel. It's hard to fully understand how frustrated and over it that clubhouse was last season unless you were there every day. There's a lot of improvement Shelton and Co. can achieve without the Pirates spending a time, simply because they're going to want to play for this group more than they did the old one. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Spending a *dime</p>
<p><strong>Benson DuBois</strong>: If the Pirates held Marte through his contract, they could have let him (likely) reject the QO and collect a draft pick equal to one of the two 19-year-olds they got for him. In essence they gave up two years of Marte at a reasonable cost to get one extra player who is four years away. Does this make sense? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: If you like the players you got -- let's face it: Neither of us know a blessed thing about these guys -- why wait? And, also, what if he gets hurt late in that 2020 season, then you're forced into making him a QO. What if he's really hurt? I don't have an issue with the trade. You need to trust Cherington/Sanders to do what they have a track record of doing. I do hope they repurpose some of that money into players for 2020, however.</p>
<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Jason. to your knowledge, have any teams approached the Pirates regarding Bell's availability ? Is it fair to expect a team's top 10 pitching prospect in exchange for him ? Who is the player besides Bell that would yield the best return in a trade ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I can't tell you whether the Pirates have had any meaningful discussions on Bell, although yeah, absolutely it would be fair to expect a top 10 pitching prospect in exchange for him. I think it would be fair to expect a heck of a lot more than that, honestly. And best return? Newman or Reynolds, I would imagine. Among trade candidates, though, probably Archer if he figures it out, given starting pitching is such a commodity. But again, he has to pitch better. Kela could net them something, too, provided he doesn't have any off-field issues, meaning injuries or blowups.</p>
<p><strong>Gball</strong>: Jason, do you ever think MLB will step in and put a salary floor in effect? I'm not a Nutting basher because MLB is allowing him to run this team as a business and that's exactly what he's doing. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't. Because I don't see how you could implement a floor without a ceiling. That said, I think it's needed. I think teams like the Pirates should be spending more on major league players, and I think teams like the Yankees should be spending less. Believe me, I'm all for a salary cap similar to that of the other three major pro sports.</p>
<p><strong>SlamDog</strong>: Jason how many of your hits were actually ground balls to the shortstop but the 70 yr old couldnt throw the ball across the diamond? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Haha. Not many, honestly. I know I had one or two fantasy camp specials in there, not gonna lie. But I did hit the ball decently hard.k</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong>: If the Yankees spend less, though, that means they are, in reality, "cheaper" than the Pirates. There lies the problem--the revenue is very lopsided. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I agree with you, Steve. As I said, I think there should be a floor and a ceiling. I think baseball's economic system absolutely stinks. It's not fair to fans.</p>
<p><strong>JimM</strong>: Jason, Have you asked Ben Cherington if he’s considering miving Oneil Cruz to the outfield? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: He was asked at one time or another. Don't remember who asked him. Believe it was at the Winter Meetings. I think they're still figuring out what's best for Cruz. I would say considering it is fair, but I'm not sure they've settled on anything concrete at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Sean</strong>: Why do you seem to be a shill for Nutting? All of your columns and articles reek of making excuses for this pathetic payroll and act like these free agent signings are awesome when they are a joke. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: What article did I write that says their free agent signings are awesome? If you could send a link, that would be much appreciated because I can't seem to remember that one. My job is to report on what they do and analyze it to the best of my ability -- hence the title, beat reporter. Columnists are paid for their opinions. I'm pretty sure Cook, Starkey, Collier and Zeise have all ripped the Pirates at various times this offseason. You wanna get pissed about what they're doing, great. But I'm not sitting here saying fans should be OK with this. I'm explaining who they signed and what these guys have done good and bad.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin V</strong>: Jason <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin V</strong>: Jason Just saw that the Pirates signed a 16 year old Aussie OF, Solomon Maguire. Where would a player like that play for the next few years? The Latin American development leagues would not seem to be a good fit there. Just curious.Thanks and really enjoy your coverage. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thanks, Kevin. I'm told Maguire will first finish up high school in Australia. Then, who knows? Could come to the states and play affiliated ball if he's ready for that. I think it's TBD at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong>: I'm not sure we're on the same page. When I say the Yankees would be cheaper, I mean they aren't spending on players in step with their revenue if they spend less. You can't say the Pirates need to spend more while the Yankees spend less. They are conflicting ideals. In theory, everyone needs to spend more, which may only happen with greater revenue sharing--something big markets will probably never agree to. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I agree with you, Steve. Thanks for participating.</p>
<p><strong>BDog</strong>: Does Bob Nutting if he wanted to have $130 million a year to spend on the payroll? And I am being serious asking about that. Maybe he isn't the rich liquid cash guy everyone thinks. Seven Springs is probably losing money because it doesn't snow anymore, the newspaper industry isn't profitable like it used to be. I guess my thoughts are if Cherington means he'll eventually raise payroll what the heck does that mean? In 2025 I'll go back to $90 million? Are we supposed to be happy about that? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I would hope not, given the MLB average is, what $124 million? Not positive on that number, but it's around that. I've said this before -- even if Sean seems to have missed it -- I think the Pirates should be spending more than they are. And if Bob Nutting either is unwilling to unable to spend at least the league average on his team, then I think he owes it to the fans and everyone else to sell. But given the situation they're in right now, I'm OK saying to Cherington and others, "Hey, fix all this crap that's wrong, then I'll push in my chips." The key will be if Nutting follows through if/when the improvements occur.</p>
<p><strong>SalemPirate</strong>: Puig's name has been floated as a possible FA signing. Imagine Kela and Puig in the same locker room and add Crick to a somewhat volatile mix. Would this mix even be a consideration given the problems from the last season? Thanks for the chats. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Keep Puig out of that room, IMO. Bunch of good kids there. I don't know about Puig. He may be a good dude, honestly. But I don't think I want to take that chance. Also, Crick and Kela together weren't an issue. I don't know why people seem to want to create that narrative. Crick had an ongoing issue with Vazquez. Kela and Crick both popped off at coaches, which can't happen -- on either side. But it's not like the two of them bickered at each other constantly.</p>
<p><strong>Don Orris</strong>: Instead of spending nothing for a few years until perhaps the payroll goes up, what would be wrong with Nutting committing $100 million each year like he did in 2015 while the farm system gets rebuilt? We have a decent core, that extra money gets up a few legit players in free agency every year and then we have a team that at least can compete for the playoffs? Am I wrong? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You're not. I agree with you. And if that's impossible, to fall $29 million below the league average, what the heck are we doing here? Again, this number is skewed because of the teams at the top. But wanting your favorite team to spend more than $50 million on payroll is not an unfair ask.</p>
<p><strong>Hi</strong>: BDog--Nutting's liquid cash means nothing. The owner isn't writing checks for the business out of his personal checkbook. It's the cash generated by the business in question, not the owners personal net worth. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You bring up a good point. It's not as simple as Nutting just writing a check. Also, you can win without spending like the Yankees. It has been done before. But their current payroll is very low.</p>
<p><strong>Morty</strong>: Funny how last year's big Pirates prediction in a national publication was Josh Bell being a bust. Why does anyone put stock in this USA Today crap? Pirates lack impact players, but they have a young and improving core and had some bad luck last year with injuries. I could easily see a repeat performance of 70 wins +/- a few. Nothing to get excited about but not doomsday scenario <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I couldn't care less about the USA Today prediction. But given this is my beat, and my life, I'm happy people want to talk about baseball. I just think you need to take these things with a grain of salt. I also think much of the negativity will dissipate if the Pirates can be even remotely respectable in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Morty</strong>: Is the FO prioritizing defense this offseason? Seems like the additions profile with weak offense but decent defense/speed? If that' <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They have behind the plate, anyway, bringing in a couple guys who handle pitchers well. Heredia is also a decent bench guy, honestly. They could do worse. Much of their defensive improvement also must come from within. The Pirates were awful in this department last season. It's on Shelton and Co. to improve big time.</p>
<p><strong>Morty</strong>: sorry hit send too soon -- is FO considering D improvement in roster/lineup? Seems like Newman and Moran would be impacted. Bell may be exception <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think I got this one earlier. If not, lemme know.</p>
<p><strong>BDog</strong>: Jason has anyone in the media including you asked Nutting why he cut payroll after the 2015 team won 98 games and 3 straight years of record attendance? I still 4 years later do not understand why he did this and why he was unwilling to add another piece or 2 to get us to the world series. Can you ask him that during spring training? And also please ask him why he didn't use the $50 million BAM money on payroll. Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I can't speak for what was done before; I only got on the beat in May 2019. I would have to imagine so, yes. Although there have been different topics broached with Bob during our time with him this offseason. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: But yes, will be happy to address this with him in spring training. I think you bring up a very good point.</p>
<p><strong>Hi</strong>: One of the biggest misconceptions...payroll did not go down after 2015. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Believe 2016, technically, went down like a couple million bucks, but then 2017 was above 2015. Regardless, I get what the reader was saying: Nutting didn't properly build upon that 2015 club. And it also wasn't just Bob. Huntington didn't do a good enough job continuing to keep the window open because his moves left a lot to be desired.</p>
<p><strong>JimM</strong>: Are the Pirates still looking at CF Fas? Trades? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Both, I would say. Cherington said he hopes to have someone by the first full squad workout.</p>
<p><strong>Cappy</strong>: Any word on why Wehner wasn't promoted to Blass' position this year. I'm being serious this rotation nonsense sounds awful. Wehner is 1 of the few that will actually criticize the team during the broadcasts so I'm thinking maybe that played a part in it. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Not a ton I can share publicly, other than it has nothing to do with the quality of Wehner's work. I think it had more to do with the schedule than anything. I agree with you, though: I think Rock does a really, really good job.</p>
<p><strong>Morty</strong>: Can we hold out hope for some infusion of higher end DR/Latin America talent. Guys like Acuna were acquired for a few hundred K. Pirates haven't hit on any comparable international signings since Polanco. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yes, you can. And should. It's a part of baseball that the Pirates, as a small-market team, simply need to do well. And they've been bad at it lately. They need to discover more talent in the DR or wherever, then actually develop that talent through their system.</p>
<p><strong>Hi</strong>: Sorry, it didn't go up a ton, but it absolutely did not go down. It's not hard information to find, but that particular narrative is constantly pushed. Basically, you can't say the Pirates didn't spend after 2015; they didn't spend well. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Not doing the back-and-forth crap here. If you wanna look at the Pirates' yearly payrolls, go here and draw your own conclusions. I said my piece on it: <a href="http://www.stevetheump.com/Payrolls.htm#2015_payroll" target="_blank">http://www.stevetheump.com/Payrolls.htm#2015_payroll</a></p>
<p><strong>Tank </strong>: More annoying repetitive commercial, the Liberty Mutual Doug and Emu stupid commercial or the Discover Card commercials that have seemingly run for 3 years straight now. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I'd say the Discover Card ones. But it's close.</p>
<p><strong>SalemPirate</strong>: Any thoughts on who might be the CF Ben is seeking? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Have not heard a ton on Pillar. That was surprising. Hamilton would make some sense, too. Could look to bat him leadoff, maybe move Reynolds or Newman to the No. 3 spot, the other at No. 2.</p>
<p><strong>Morty</strong>: Another question for Nutting -- are you concerned that the perception of unwillingness to spend on talent has impacted the front office's ability to extract maximum return value in trade because trade partners assume financial motivation? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Will write it down, Morty, thank you. Although I, ugh, would not exactly expect him to say yes to this one.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Hi Jason. I'm guessing that Cherington came here because he got bored working for a big spending owner. He wanted a new challenge and wants to be like Billy Beane and put together a competitive team on a shoe string budget. What do you think? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know if "got bored" is the right way to put it, but I do think he likes this stuff. I talked to him for 30 minutes this morning, and you can tell he's passionate about it. That, combined with the opportunity that would exist here for someone to produce a sustained winner, I can see why someone like Cherington would give Pittsburgh a shot.</p>
<p><strong>BDog</strong>: You know Jason you gotta wonder if a guy like Polanco would have become a superstar if he was in a different organization that developed better. He was a 5 tool player and he imo has been a huge disappointment. And there are others too who imo never reached their potential and I think they might have in a different organization. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think Polanco needs to stay healthy. I'm not going to put that on the Pirates. That's not development. That's the dude being able to stay on the field. I can't even tell you if they screwed up his development or not because he really has never been consistently healthy.</p>
<p><strong>SalemPirate</strong>: Any info on the new tv deal forthcoming? Should it be made public? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think it should be made public, absolutely. However, I wouldn't hold your breath. There's a better chance of Bob Nutting giving you his home address than the club announcing those details. They will be speculated on, sure, but hard confirmation? No way.</p>
<p><strong>Morty</strong>: after 2015 they "spent" on bargains like Niese (costed fan fave Walker) and end of line reclamations like Vogelsong and Jaso when they needed SP and a 1st baseman <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Not wrong ... but there's a lot that has happened between 2015 and now. Many more mistakes made if we're really going to analyze it.</p>
<p><strong>Morty</strong>: Baz is a better example of poor development pipeline than Polanco. He was still very young and it seemed like they wrote him off early. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Baz, Meadows and Glasnow. If the Pirates had developed those guys appropriately, there's no way they trade them. There would be no reason for them to trade them.</p>
<p><strong>Tammy</strong>: Hi Jason I think you do a good job. Do you think the home opener sells out? My boyfriend and all of his friends think it won't because the fans are fed up. I agree with that. Thank you. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Tammy, <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thank you for the kind words. Yeah, I think it will sell out. In the end, Pittsburgh is an awesome sports city. People will go. And they'll grumble about Bob Nutting. But if moving over to this beat has shown me anything, it's that people want this team to be good; they're just pissed. I look at our traffic, my chat participation, etc. All of that stuff compares favorably to hockey, honestly. There's a lot more vitriol, sure, but I think people do care. They just want to see better baseball, and they deserve that.</p>
<p><strong>SalemPirate</strong>: If the opportunity to improve the MLB team were to present itself and given the financial flexibility that is currently available, should the Pirates look into upgrades? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Absolutely. They won 69 games last year. They should be looking under every rock they find.</p>
<p><strong>Andy</strong>: Why don't you POINT BLANK ask Bob Nutting how spending $50 million or less this season even with new mgmt is earning goodwill to the fans? Ask him just like that. And follow it up with why can't you spend $100 million every year which is still way below the average($145 million I just checked). Nutting needs to be challenged, tough questions. No sugarcoating. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know if I did it POINT BLANK or shook my fist in his face (I didn't) but I did ask Nutting at PiratesFest why he doesn't spend more. Here's that piece, which I'm guessing you missed: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/25/Pirates-Bob-Nutting-add-payroll-money/stories/202001250034" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/25/Pirates-Bob-Nut...</a></p>
<p><strong>SalemPirate</strong>: Nice response to Tammy's question. You were right on point. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thank you. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. That does it for this week. Thank you very much for participating. We'll do the next one of these from Bradenton. How crazy is that?</p>
