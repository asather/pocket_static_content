<h1>Trump slams governors as 'weak,' urges crackdown on protests</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday derided the nation’s governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters in the aftermath of another night of violent protests in dozens of American cities.</p>
<p>Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses.</p>
<p>“Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.”</p>
<p>The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. They turned violent in several cities, with looting and mayhem, and fires ignited in the historic park across from the White House.</p>
<p>The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced a spasm of violence, like New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again,” said Trump. “We’re doing it in Washington, D.C. We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before.”</p>
<p>The president told the governors they were making themselves “look like fools” for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets.</p>
<p>Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track the agitators and urged local officials to “dominate” the streets and control, not react to crowds, and urged them to “go after troublemakers.”</p>
<p>Trump’s angry exhortations at the nation’s governors came after a night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation’s airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests grew so heated Friday night that the Secret Service <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation" target="_blank">rushed the president to an underground bunker</a> previously used during terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Trump continued his effort to project strength, using a series of inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks during a time of national crisis.</p>
<p>As cities burned night after night and images of violence dominated television coverage, Trump’s advisers discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president’s own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity.</p>
<p>Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to so Monday either.</p>
