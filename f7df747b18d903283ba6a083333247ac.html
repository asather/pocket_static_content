<h1>Hurricane Delta makes landfall in Louisiana</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hurricane Delta made landfall near Creole, La., on Friday evening, retreading ground that had been shredded by Hurricane Laura just six weeks ago. Delta was lashing Louisiana with high winds, knocking out power and driving a storm surge of over 7 feet in some areas.</p>
<p>The fast-moving storm was expected to move through the state in about 14 hours, but residents were warned to prepare for possible tornadoes and flash flooding. Southwest and south-central Louisiana may see up to 15 inches of rain through Saturday.</p>
<p>By 7:30 p.m. Central time Friday, the storm had knocked out electricity to 217,000 customers in Louisiana and nearly 100,000 on Texas’ Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>Phil Klotzbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University, said Delta was the 10th named storm to make landfall in the United States this year, breaking the previous record of nine storms in 1916.</p>
<p>In a Friday afternoon news conference before Delta made landfall, Gov. John Bel Edwards said he hoped the Lake Charles area — which was badly damaged by Hurricane Laura — would escape the worst of the new storm but warned that hurricane-force winds would almost certainly be felt there. “We know this is going to exacerbate what is already a bad situation,” he said.</p>
<p>Delta made landfall in Cameron Parish just 20 miles east of where Hurricane Laura hit on Aug. 27 as a Category 4 storm.</p>
<p>Delta struck a sprawling and sparsely populated area that had already been ravaged by the earlier storm. The unincorporated community of Creole had been nearly wiped out: The intersection with a gas station, restaurant and grocery store that constituted downtown had been reduced to scattered rubble.</p>
<p>Residents across the region were exasperated and exhausted by an already brutal hurricane season. The latest storm managed to deliver a blow even before it arrived.</p>
<p>“We just went through a major catastrophe, and in our wildest dreams, no one would have thought that six weeks later we would be going through the same thing,” Mayor Nic Hunter of Lake Charles said, adding, “People are frustrated, people are emotional, people are fatigued.”</p>
<p>Throughout this hurricane season, Louisiana has been forced to find emergency shelter for large numbers of displaced people while taking into account the risk of spreading the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Mr. Edwards said there were more than 9,500 Louisianians in shelters as of Friday afternoon, most of them evacuees from the previous storm. But he said more than 800 evacuees were being housed because of Delta, many of them in a mega-shelter in Alexandria, La.</p>
