<h1>Remembering John Lewis, civil rights icon and `American hero'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — People paid great heed to John Lewis for much of his life in the civil rights movement. But at the very beginning — when he was just a kid wanting to be a minister someday — his audience didn’t care much for what he had to say.</p>
<p>A son of Alabama sharecroppers, the young Lewis first preached moral righteousness to his family’s chickens. His place in the vanguard of the 1960s campaign for Black equality had its roots in that hardscrabble Alabama farm.</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis, who died Friday at age 80, was the youngest and last survivor of the Big Six civil rights activists who organized the 1963 March on Washington, and spoke shortly before the group’s leader, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., gave his “I Have a Dream” speech to a vast sea of people.</p>
<p>If that speech marked a turning point in the civil rights era — or at least the most famous moment — the struggle was far from over. Two more hard years passed before truncheon-wielding state troopers beat Mr. Lewis bloody and fractured his skull as he led 600 protesters over Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge.</p>
<p>Searing TV images of that brutality helped to galvanize national opposition to racial oppression and embolden leaders in Washington to pass the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act five months later.</p>
<p>“The American public had already seen so much of this sort of thing, countless images of beatings and dogs and cursing and hoses,” Mr. Lewis wrote in his memoirs. “But something about that day in Selma touched a nerve deeper than anything that had come before.”</p>
<p>That bridge became a touchstone in Mr. Lewis’ life. He returned there often during his decades in Congress representing the Atlanta area, bringing lawmakers from both parties to see where “Bloody Sunday” went down.</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis earned bipartisan respect in Washington, where some called him the “conscience of Congress.” His humble manner contrasted with the puffed chests on Capitol Hill. But as a liberal on the losing side of many issues, he lacked the influence he’d summoned at the segregated lunch counters of his youth, or later, within the Democratic Party, as a steadfast voice for the poor and disenfranchised.</p>
<p>He was a guiding voice for a young Illinois senator who became the first Black president.</p>
<p>“I told him that I stood on his shoulders,” Barack Obama wrote in a statement marking Lewis’s death. “When I was elected President of the United States, I hugged him on the inauguration stand before I was sworn in and told him I was only there because of the sacrifices he made.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis was a 23-year-old firebrand, a founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, when he joined King and four other civil rights leaders at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York to plan and announce the Washington demonstration. The others were Whitney Young of the National Urban League; A. Philip Randolph of the Negro American Labor Council; James L. Farmer Jr., of the interracial Congress of Racial Equality; and Roy Wilkins of the NAACP.</p>
<p>After months of training in nonviolent protest, demonstrators led by Mr. Lewis and the Rev. Hosea Williams began a march of more than 50 miles from Selma to Alabama’s capital in Montgomery. They didn’t get far: On March 7, 1965, a phalanx of police blocked their exit from the Selma bridge. Authorities swung truncheons, fired tear gas and charged on horseback, sending many to the hospital. The nation was horrified.</p>
<p>“The sight of them rolling over us like human tanks was something that had never been seen before. People just couldn’t believe this was happening, not in America,” Mr. Lewis wrote.</p>
<p>King swiftly returned to the scene with a multitude, and the march to Montgomery was made whole before the end of the month.</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis was born on Feb. 21, 1940, outside Troy, in Alabama’s Pike County. He attended segregated public schools and was denied a library card because of his race, but he read books and newspapers avidly, and could rattle off obscure historical facts even in his later years.</p>
<p>He was a teenager when he first heard King, then a young minister from Atlanta, preach on the radio. They met after Mr. Lewis wrote him seeking support to become the first Black student at his local college. He ultimately attended the American Baptist Theological Seminary and Fisk University instead, in Nashville, Tenn.</p>
<p>Soon, the young man King nicknamed “the boy from Troy” was organizing sit-ins at whites-only lunch counters and volunteering as a Freedom Rider, enduring beatings and arrests while challenging segregation around the South. Mr. Lewis helped form the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to organize this effort, led the group from 1963 to 1966 and kept pursuing civil rights work and voter registration drives for years thereafter.</p>
<p>President Jimmy Carter appointed Mr. Lewis to lead ACTION, a federal volunteer agency, in 1977. In 1981, he was elected to the Atlanta City Council, and then won a seat in Congress in 1986.</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis refused to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration, saying he didn’t consider him a “legitimate president” because Russians had conspired to get him elected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Trump ordered flags at half-staff at the White House and all federal public buildings and grounds, including embassies abroad and all military posts and naval stations, throughout the day Saturday.</p>
<p>“Saddened to hear the news of civil rights hero John Lewis passing. Melania and I send our prayers to he and his family,” Mr. Trump said via Twitter.</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis announced in late December 2019 that he had been diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>“I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now,” he said at the time.</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis’ wife of four decades, Lillian Miles, died in 2012. They had one son, John Miles Lewis.</p>
