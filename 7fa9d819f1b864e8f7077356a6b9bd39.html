<h1>Shot clock for basketball voted down by national high school federation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s not yet time for a shot clock in high school basketball. At least that’s what the national governing body for high school athletics says.</p>
<p>The basketball rules committee of the National Federation of State High School Associations recently voted down a proposal that would establish a 35-second shot clock for boys and girls basketball around the country. The rules committee also turned down a proposal to allow state organizations, such as the PIAA, to adopt a shot clock if they wanted. The national federation establishes rules for all high school sports.</p>
<p>A high school shot clock has long been debated, but seems to have become a hot topic more and more in recent years. The NBA and WNBA have a 24-second shot clock and the NCAA has a 30-second clock for men’s and women’s games.</p>
<p>It seems many high school coaches — and fans — favor a shot clock. Two years ago, the Post-Gazette surveyed all boys and girls coaches in the WPIAL and City League about a shot clock. A total of 117 coaches (64 boys and 53 girls) <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2018/01/11/Shot-clock-WPIAL-City-League-coaches-Post-Gazette-survey/stories/201801120029" target="_blank">responded to the survey</a> and 71% said they would like to see a shot clock instituted.</p>
<p>Theresia Wynns is the director of sports and officials for the NFHS and commented in an email, “The basketball rules committee, as a whole, is not against the shot clock. There are some members of the committee that support a shot clock. They tend to be in the minority. This issue is discussed very thoroughly each year. We offer what we think are the pros and cons for the use of the shot clock. We talk about what does the game gain by using a shot clock that the game does not have without the shot clock.”</p>
<p>But what is ironic about this shot clock debate is that, as of two years ago, nine states —&nbsp;Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Washington, New York, California, North Dakota and South Dakota — used a shot clock. Those states instituted a shot clock without the blessing of the NFHS. The consequence of not following the NFHS rules is that the state association is not permitted to have membership on the NFHS rules committee.</p>
<p>So, despite the NFHS voting down the shot clock rule, the PIAA could still institute the shot clock if it really wanted. But PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi said the PIAA, like many states, chooses to follow the NFHS rules rather than make its own rule.</p>
<p>Critics of a high school shot clock often use money as a reason for not instituting it, especially in these days of athletic budgets being cut at some high schools.</p>
<p>Wynns said, “We talk about the perceived prohibitive issues of the use of the shot clock, such as the cost of equipment, the cost of personnel to run the shot clock, the training of the shot clock personnel, finding an individual who will be consistently available to run the clock, training of officials to adjudicate the issues around setting and resetting the shot clock.</p>
<p>“The issue of a slowed down game always comes up in the discussion of the shot clock. This is not a situation that occurs game after game. We concede that it does happen occasionally. It is not an overriding factor that makes the use of the shot clock necessary. We have in the past shared information with the committee that showed the average time for a basketball shot was less than 35 seconds 90% of the time.”</p>
<p><strong>Rocco resigns at Penn-Trafford</strong></p>
<p>After more than two decades of coaching WPIAL boys basketball, and winning more than 300 games, Jim Rocco is walking away.Rocco resigned as Penn-Trafford’sboys coach after five seasons. He had a 54-57 record, including a 14-9 mark the past two seasons. Rocco’s son, Zach, played the past four seasons at Penn-Trafford and will play next season at West Point (Army).</p>
<p>Rocco spent the first 19 seasons of his career at Penn Hills, where he was 257-127, with two WPIAL championships and one PIAA title. His career record was 311-184.</p>
<p><strong>Avonworth hires Mancuso</strong></p>
<p>The new boys basketball coach at Avonworth is fresh off a WPIAL championship season — in football.</p>
<p>Mike Mancuso was the defensive coordinator for Avonworth’s football team that won the WPIAL Class 2A championship in 2019. But Mancuso is giving up football coaching after he was hired Monday night as the new boys basketball coach at Avonworth.</p>
<p>“For me to be the head coach I want to be, I need to focus on just one sport,” Mancuso said. “If you’re an assistant coach, you can do multiple sports. But when you’re the head guy, there are a lot of plates spinning in there, and you have to get in and be detailed on just the one sport.”</p>
<p>Mancuso, a former football-basketball athlete at North Allegheny in the 1990s, has never been a high school head coach for any sport, but he has extensive experience in a number of sports. In basketball, he was most recently an assistant at Shaler, but also has been an assistant at Hampton and a ninth-grade assistant at Avonworth.</p>
<p>He started his coaching career as an assistant football coach at Pine-Richland in 2001 and also was a football assistant at Hampton. He also has been an assistant varsity coach in track and field and baseball.</p>
<p>“I’ve always known I wanted to be a head coach, either football or basketball,” Mancuso said. “But basketball was really my first love. I lived in Fort Leavenworth, Kan., growing up and I still remember my first University of Kansas game when I was in fourth grade. Danny Manning was playing and I just fell in love with the game then. Long story short, that was when I knew basketball would be part of my life.</p>
<p>“At Avonworth, we use multi-sport athletes. I think that’s an advantage I have because I could speak to the football player and get him to play basketball, or speak to the track athlete and tell him all these sports run together. All of these things come together and I really tried to sell that to Avonworth. I maybe don’t have the splash of being a head coach here, here and here, but I’ve been really working on my craft as a coach.”</p>
<p><strong>Plum’s Montue chooses Oakland</strong></p>
<p>Another girls basketball player from the class of 2021 has made a verbal commitment to a Division I college. Kennedie Montue, a junior at Plum, committed Monday to Oakland in Rochester, Mich. Montue is a 5-11 forward who averaged 22.1 points a game this season. She was a Post-Gazette all-WPIAL Class 5A selection and also second-team all-state.</p>
