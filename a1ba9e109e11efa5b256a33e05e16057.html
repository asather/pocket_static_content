<h1>Rep. Doyle, a familiar face in Congress, declares victory in 18th District Dem primary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle declared victory on Tuesday night in the Democratic primary election for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District, after amassing a roughly 71%-to-29% lead over his challenger, Jerry Dickinson, from mail-in ballots and early batches of in-person voting,&nbsp;according to Allegheny County election results.</p>
<p>“Our margins seem to be holding steady,” Mr. Doyle, D-Forest Hills, said on a video call with reporters shortly after 10 p.m. Though Mr. Doyle had not spoken with Mr. Dickinson, he said he felt&nbsp;“very confident” the margin is “not going to be changed dramatically with the rest of the returns that come in.”</p>
<p>Not long after Mr. Doyle’s expressed confidence, the Associated Press called the election in Mr. Doyle’s favor.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickinson, a 33-year-old University of Pittsburgh law professor, did not concede Tuesday, canceling a planned press conference and speech to supporters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At numerous polling locations this evening, voters remained in line after the polls closed,” Mr. Dickinson wrote in a statement at about 11 p.m., around the time the AP called the election. “As a constitutional law professor, I believe it is imperative we allow the democratic process to play its course.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A win in Tuesday’s primary all but assures Mr. Doyle a 14th term representing the deeply Democratic district, which includes the city of Pittsburgh and its southern suburbs. Mr. Doyle, with nearly 26 years in Washington, is the longest-serving member of Congress from Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“I’m very gratified that Pittsburgh has given me the opportunity to serve them for another two years,”&nbsp;Mr. Doyle told reporters. “We need voices in our leadership and in the Congress that are looking for ways to unite Americans.”</p>
<p>County election results showed Mr. Doyle won&nbsp;a vast majority of the 1,322 precincts reporting results. Mr. Dickinson won several precincts in Oakland, Bloomfield, East Liberty, Wilkinsburg and Swissvale. The county calculated a 32% turnout in the district on 83,453 ballots counted as of 11:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle said he was eager to get back to work as the country confronts angry protests over police brutality and the COVID-19 pandemic that had claimed more than 100,000 lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s a very challenging time, but these are the times we can show what we’re really made of as Americans,” he said. The House, currently on recess through most of June, may come back to Washington early to vote on a package of policing reforms, he added.</p>
<p>Lawmakers will also look at approving another round of legislation to help business and individuals affected by the pandemic, he said. “We know people are still hurting out there,” he said. “There’s still more work to be done.”</p>
<p>The Democratic primary contest shaped up to be a clash over the intersection of progressive politics and practical need for compromise in Congress.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickinson of Regent Square cast himself <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2019/11/18/Jerry-Dickinson-Mike-Doyle-primary-challenge-progressive-Congress/stories/201911170010" target="_blank">as a liberal visionary</a> who could better serve a Rust Belt district that has little chance of being won by a Republican.</p>
<p>Launching his campaign in April 2019, Mr. Dickinson argued the district, which includes impoverished communities in the Mon Valley, still lagged the country in air quality and livability standards despite Mr. Doyle’s lengthy term on Capitol Hill. He criticized the incumbent for what Mr. Dickinson called a lack of signature legislation and leadership roles.</p>
<p>Central pillars of Mr. Dickinson’s platform included advocating for the Green New Deal to fight climate change, a ban on fracking, expanding affordable housing and reforming the criminal justice system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle defended his record, leaning on his experience navigating committee hearings and making deals in Congress to benefit the Pittsburgh region. He’s among the top Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chairing a subcommittee that oversees communications and technology issues.</p>
<p>On energy and environmental issues, Mr. Doyle has called natural gas a “bridge fuel” to take the country to a future of renewable energy. This year, the Energy and Commerce Committee <a href="/On%20energy%20and%20environmental%20issues,%20Mr.%20Doyle%20called%20natural%20gas%20a%20“bridge%20fuel”%20to%20take%20the%20country%20to%20a%20future%20of%20renewable%20energy.%20This%20year,%20the%20Energy%20and%20Commerce%20Committee%20put%20forth%20a%20climate%20bill%20that%20would%20move%20the%20country%20to%20100%%20net-zero%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20by%202050." target="_blank">put forth a climate bill</a> that would move the country to 100% net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle said he had directly aided Pittsburgh’s economic progression from a city that was still struggling from the collapse of steel at the time of his election to Congress in 1994. Congressional appropriations helped the region diversify into a hub for health care, technology, banking and education, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He pointed to more than $650 million in federal funding to projects in the city, including dollars that helped start Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute. Last week, the Trump administration announced a $100 million grant for the&nbsp;Port Authority of Allegheny County that allows the long-awaited Pittsburgh Bus Rapid Transit project to begin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That’s a project I‘ve been working on diligently for three years now,” Mr. Doyle told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>Financial resources also went Mr. Doyle’s way.</p>
<p>At the end of March, Mr. Doyle, with access to funds provided by congressional committees, had nearly nine times the amount of cash on hand as Mr. Dickinson — $391,000 to $44,000, according to federal filings.</p>
<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic shutting down traditional door-to-door campaigning, Mr. Doyle advertised directly to voters through May, spending about&nbsp;$18,500 in the campaign’s final month&nbsp;on mailers and yard signs, according to federal election records.</p>
<p>In November, Mr. Doyle will face a Republican on the ballot: Luke Negron, a 27-year-old Grove City College graduate who received 15,000 votes so far running&nbsp;unopposed in Tuesday’s Republican primary.</p>
