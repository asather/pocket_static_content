<h1>Edgeworth businessman pleads guilty to tax evasion</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Edgeworth real estate professional who works in New York City waived indictment Wednesday in federal court in Pittsburgh and pleaded guilty to tax evasion.</p>
<p>Dean Britton, who worked in New York negotiating high-dollar commercial ground leases, had been charged June 2 in what prosecutors call an "information," or formal charge by the government.</p>
<p>After the IRS contacted him about unfiled tax returns from 2013 to 2017, he filed several years' worth of returns reporting that he owned more than $1.1 million in outstanding taxes, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>But he didn't pay the taxes he acknowledged he owed, according to his plea.</p>
<p>Instead, prosecutors said, he evaded taxes by placing the title to his house in the name of his wife, used business bank accounts to pay his personal expenses and directed income into new personal bank accounts he established after the IRS levied his prior account.</p>
<p>During the years in question, Britton spent more than $1.46 million on personal expenses, including about $770,000 on real estate purchases, $240,000 in home rentals, $165,000 on financing an art gallery operated by his wife, $96,000 in home renovations, $74,000 on travel, $65,000 in country club expenses and $50,000 on private school tuition.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Carolyn Bloch said the IRS had made "significant efforts" to collect Britton's unpaid tax liabilities, sending him notices, issuing liens and attempting to contact him through the power of attorney that Britton had designated to represent him before the IRS.</p>
<p>Knowing that he owed the taxes, she said, Britton engaged in a series of acts to shield his money and assets. In 2013, he removed his name from a pending deal to buy a house for him and his wife and later bought a house for $770,000 in cash using real estate commissions he earned. He then titled the house in his wife's name only, Ms. Bloch said, shielding the home from IRS liens.</p>
<p>After the IRS tried to levy his bank account in May 2016, Britton closed the account and opened a new one at a different bank, Ms. Bloch said, and directed business associates to deposit payments into the new account.</p>
<p>In August 2016, he directed an associate to wire funds to an account held only in his wife's name, which had been opened four days earlier, Ms. Bloch said.</p>
<p>And in September 2016, Britton created a corporation that he used to open a new business bank account from which he paid his personal expenses, according to the plea.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Nora Barry Fischer set sentencing for Nov. 5.</p>
