<h1>Penguins vote 'yes' to NHL's 24-team playoff format</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While there are still a number of details to work out before the NHL can resume its season, the NHL Players’ Association took its first significant step toward a possible return Friday night.</p>
<p>The executive board comprising the 31 player reps voted to authorize further negotiations on a 24-team return-to-play format that would jump directly into the postseason. The Penguins, who would be the No. 5 seed in the tournament and start the postseason against No. 12 Montreal, are reportedly among the teams onboard, voting yes, according to a report from Sportsnet.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, nobody gets exactly what they want,” Penguins player rep Kris Letang told Sportsnet. “But we all want what is best for hockey and to continue to grow the game.”</p>
<p>Under this plan, the top four teams in each conference will earn first-round byes in the postseason. The next eight teams based on points percentage will compete in play-in series. After the play-in round, the bracket turns into a more traditional 16-team, seven-game format.</p>
<p>Several details still need to be ironed out. One of them is reportedly whether the tournament will be bracket-style or if the field will be reseeded.</p>
<p>No format will be perfect. But there are a number of advantages to the 24-team plan. It will give teams who were separated by only a point or two in the standings a fair opportunity to get into a 16-team field. It adds big-market teams such as the New York Rangers and the Chicago Blackhawks. And the extra round and higher stakes might attract more TV eyeballs, thus creating more revenue for the league.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Penguins are one of the teams that might be at greatest risk from the expanded format. While Montreal (31-31-9) is a sub-.500 team and the lowest seed in the bracket, goaltender Carey Price is among the most well-respected netminders in the league. For the second straight season, he was voted by the NHL Players’ Association as the top goalie.</p>
<p>What if Price steals a series? From a competitive standpoint, the Penguins (40-23-6) have been one of the better teams in the Eastern Conference. From a revenue standpoint, it would eliminate one of the league’s largest fanbases and most marketable stars.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, the playoffs are a different beast,” Letang told Sportsnet. “No matter [who] you play, it’s going to be hard. [If it wasn’t Montreal], it was going to be Washington, or Philadelphia, or a challenge like that. We have a lot of experience, I’ve never heard of an easy series. Look at Tampa from last year.</p>
<p>“It’s a great challenge for our team right off the bat.”</p>
<p>While Friday’s news is a key step, plenty of questions will need to be answered and hurdles will need to be cleared before the season resumes.</p>
<p>How often will players need to be tested for COVID-19, and how much testing is available? How many “hub” cities will be used, and where are they? When will players be permitted to begin a training camp period, which many players said would need to be about three weeks long? When will everything begin? And what kind of impact will this have on next season?</p>
<p>“We miss hockey and it would be fun to get the passion back, but the most important thing is everybody’s health,” Letang said. “Only if we can make it safe for everyone — including trainers, coaches, people who work at the rink (will we return to play).”</p>
