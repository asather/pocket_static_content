<h1>Steelers offensive lineman Matt Feiler beats the clock, signs RFA tender</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers offensive lineman Matt Feiler and cornerback Mike Hilton are going to sign their restricted free agent tenders Thursday, a move most RFAs will be making before the end of the week.</p>
<p>Under the new collective bargaining agreement, teams have the right to reduce the offer beginning next week. Feiler and Hilton will make $3.25 million on the second-round tender the Steelers offered.</p>
<p>Feiler is expected to start at right tackle or left guard for the Steelers this season. He spent most of the past two years as the starting right tackle.</p>
<p>Hilton, who is entering his fourth season, is the starting slot corner and has four career interceptions.</p>
