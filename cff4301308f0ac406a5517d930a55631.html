<h1>A cough, a cruise ship and a Westmoreland County case of coronavirus</h1>

<p>The email arrived on Wednesday. “You are receiving this communication because our records indicate that you were a passenger on the March 7, 2020 voyage of the Norwegian Breakaway,” it began, going on to say that “a passenger who traveled aboard the vessel on the March 7, 2020 voyage of the Norwegian Breakaway tested positive for COVID-19.”</p>
<p>It was an indication of what Lisa Duffy had believed since just after she stepped off the cruise ship —&nbsp;overcome with body aches, fever and fatigue as she stood outside the airport.</p>

<p>“I have never been that sick in my life,” said Ms. Duffy, 50, who quit smoking about six years ago and said she had no other risk factors. “The minute it hit me, I knew.”</p>
<p>Two days prior, Ms. Duffy and a friend had both come down with a dry, itchy cough on board the cruise. At the time, they believed that it was from breathing cigarette smoke in the ship’s casino.</p>
<p>Then, standing at a Florida airport — waiting for her husband to pick up a rental car for a day of sightseeing in Port Canaveral — “I went from feeling wonderful to feeling like total death in a moment,” Ms. Duffy said on the phone from her Hempfield home, coughing throughout an hour-long interview. “It was like the blink of an eye.”</p>
<p>Ms. Duffy had followed the news about COVID-19 and had considered canceling the March 7 cruise. She decided to go in part because the couple was traveling with friends from Kentucky who had already arrived in Florida. “We went back and forth about it,” she said. “Everybody seemed to think it wasn’t a big deal, so we ended up going.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>By the time the ship docked back in Florida on March 14, Ms. Duffy and her husband were sufficiently concerned that they were considering driving home instead of flying — to protect themselves from getting the virus from others on the airplane.</p>
<p>With her feeling so sick, they decided to drive — to protect the others on the airplane from Ms. Duffy.</p>
<p>She was so worried about spreading coronavirus that from the car on the drive home she called her daughter and her daughter’s fiance, who live with the Duffys in a suite with a separate entrance. She told them to hang plastic sheeting to block off airflow from the rest of the house. Ms. Duffy runs an animal rescue group, Cross Your Paws, and arranged for a co-worker to do a planned rescue.</p>
<p>That Sunday night, March 15, she called her primary care physician hoping to leave a message that would be returned the next morning. She said she was connected to an on-call infectious disease nurse at Excela Health who told her that despite her symptoms and travel history, she did not qualify for a COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>“I drove home not to infect others,” Ms. Duffy said she told the nurse, pointing out that she had been on a cruise ship with a crew who would be flying home to places all over the world. “It’s insane not to test me.”</p>
<p>The next morning, she heard that a medical clinic, Central Wellness Outreach Center, had set up testing that would be available without a prescription on the North Side. She and her husband made the drive from Hempfield and waited in line for about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>When they were six cars from the front, the line was shut down. The tests had run out.</p>
<p>She then called her primary care doctor, who told her to come to the office.</p>
<p>She asked if she should be tested in the parking lot but they had her come in instead, giving her a mask to wear into an exam room.</p>
<p>After she tested negative for influenza and strep, she was told to again call to seek authorization from Excela Health. On the phone from the doctor’s office, she was told that unless she first tested negative for Legionnaires disease and other conditions — tests which would not be covered by insurance — she couldn’t get the COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>She declined to spend the money, given that she was planning to self-isolate at home and was feeling slightly better anyway.</p>
<p>“Excela Health is not able to comment on individual cases,” said chief medical officer Carol Fox in an emailed statement. “Our medical staff and our infection control team follow the rapidly changing recommendations of the CDC and the PA [Department of Health].</p>
<p>“We frequently discuss cases directly with the Department of Health to obtain their guidance. We base our decisions on the guidance in effect at the time of the interaction.”</p>
<p>The next day, Ms. Duffy’s symptoms returned —&nbsp;but worse. Her lungs would burn if she tried to take a full breath. Even a half-breath would lead to a coughing fit. Her fever came back. She couldn’t stay awake.</p>
<p>She tried again on March 18 at another drive-up testing facility run by Central Wellness Outreach. After sleeping in the car for much of the two-hour wait, she was able to get tested.</p>
<p>That same day, she got the email from Norwegian Cruise lines notifying the couple about the other passenger with COVID-19.</p>
<p>“At this time, we are aware of no other similar cases from this voyage,” it read. <a href="https://www.wesh.com/article/norwegian-passenger-coronavirus/31790655" target="_blank">News reports </a>explained that a sick passenger on the ship had disembarked in Jamaica two days into the voyage and was flown to Florida, where she tested positive.</p>
<p>While Ms. Duffy waited at home for results, she tried to improve her breathing. Her daughter dropped off a pulse oximeter that Ms. Duffy had bought for her grandson when he kept getting sick at daycare.</p>
<p>As her oxygen saturation hovered in the mid-90s, she took hot showers, did breathing exercises and held her head over a pot of steaming water on the stove. She was told that if her oxygen saturation hit 92, she should call an ambulance.</p>
<p>On Friday, Ms. Duffy’s phone rang — with news of her own positive result.</p>
<p>“It was kind of a relief to finally know why I was so sick,” she said. “At the same time, I felt fear to have it confirmed. Knowing how many people have died, it was just scary.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Dr. Stacy Lane of Central Outreach Wellness Center confirmed, with Ms. Duffy’s permission, that the Hempfield resident had tested positive.</p>
<p>After Ms. Duffy’s positive result, her husband, 52, was invited to be tested at the Washington, Pa., Central Outreach Wellness Center facility.</p>
<p>On Saturday, he found out he was also positive. Sunday night, he came down with a fever.</p>
<p>By Monday morning, he had bounced back with only mild cold symptoms.</p>
<p>“It’s night and day between the two of us,” she said. “You never would have thought we had the same thing.”</p>
<p>They are two of 11 confirmed cases in Westmoreland County, according to the state Department of Health.</p>
<p>Persistent cough notwithstanding, Ms. Duffy is finally feeling better — a week and a half since the cough first appeared.&nbsp;Friday, she watched from the window as her children lit a blue smoke bomb for a gender reveal for her second grandchild.</p>
<p>Her fever has been gone for days and she finally feels like she is breathing better. She and her husband have both self-isolated since they came back from the cruise, other than attempts to be tested.</p>
<p>The friends that they went on the cruise with are still suffering from respiratory distress. They got tested near their home in Eastern Kentucky five days ago. They are still waiting for the results.</p>
