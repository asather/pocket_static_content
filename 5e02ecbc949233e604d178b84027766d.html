<h1>Sunday hunting dates, permanent Saturday deer opener among new regulations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rifle deer season will start on a Saturday again this year, and for the first time ever there will be legal hunting in Pennsylvania on some Sundays.</p>
<p>Those provisions and additional changes were announced last week during the first virtual meeting held by the Board of Game Commissioners. The teleconferencing permitted social distancing.</p>
<p>“[April 7] was an exciting day as the board approved Pennsylvania’s 2020-21 hunting and trapping seasons and hunters can start making their plans for the year ahead,” Bryan Burhans, Game Commission executive director, said in a statement. “Our upcoming hunting seasons will include our state’s first-ever Sunday hunting opportunities, another Saturday rifle deer opener and plenty more ways for hunters and trappers to get afield.”</p>
<p>In internet polls, many hunters have said they wanted the opening of rifle deer season to remain on the Monday after Thanksgiving, a tradition that had endured since 1963. In hopes that a Saturday opener would increase hunting opportunity and participation, commissioners moved the opener to a Saturday in 2019, adding that they would wait to see how hunters handled the switch before making it permanent.</p>
<p>Adult resident license sales rose from December through March, convincing some board members that the Saturday experiment had worked. Commissioner Tim Layton of Somerset County said focus groups studied by the Game Commission had spoken positively about the Saturday opener.</p>
<p>Game Commission spokesman&nbsp;Travis Lau said other commissioners agreed.</p>
<p>“I would say license sales had an influence, and maybe a big one. Sales continue to represent an increase compared to 2018-19,” he said. “Through the end of March, 853,826 general licenses had been sold, an increase of 3,733.”</p>
<p>During the meeting, state Rep. Bill Kortz, D-Allegheny, told commissioners that responses to an Internet survey he launched in February showed hunters in his district disapproved of the Saturday start. Mr. Kortz, the Democratic chairman of the House Game and Fisheries Committee, said many hunters felt the change created an intrusion into family time, hunter preparation time and camp time, as well as an impediment to small rural businesses, volunteer fire departments and clubs that depend on hunters the week after Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>”That was reflected in the results of my survey, which showed 61% of respondents want the opening day to revert back to the Monday after Thanksgiving,” Mr. Kortz said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, commissioners set the start of the 2020 rifle deer season for Saturday, Dec. 5.</p>
<p>A ban on Sunday hunting in Pennsylvania, on the books since before the founding of the United States, was removed in 2019 when state legislators agreed to permit hunting on three Sundays. Last week, the Game Commission gave final approval to the dates: Nov. 15 for archery deer hunting, Nov. 22 for bear hunting during the bear firearms season, and Nov. 29 for deer hunting during the firearms deer season, creating a rifle deer season that will start with eight continuous days.</p>
<p>Plans to institute a statewide concurrent antlered and antlerless firearms deer season collapsed when commissioners backtracked and adopted a 14-day concurrent season in 10 Wildlife Management Units, retaining a split-season in the remaining 13 WMUs.</p>
<p>“Chronic wasting disease’s effect on concurrent seasons was clear,” Mr. Lau said. “The statewide concurrent deer season … was reeled in due to comments we received that a concurrent season would result in broad deer population decreases.”</p>
<p>Chris Rosenberry, head of the Game Commission’s deer and elk unit, presented a deer population report that showed stable or increasing deer populations in every WMU. Deer populations are managed through the antlerless harvest, he said, which is controlled by the number of licenses allocated. Accounting for increased season length requires only adjusting the allocation to reach a population objective.</p>
<p>Concurrent seasons have been in place near Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The WMUs approved for concurrent seasons have been associated with CWD in free-ranging deer.</p>
<p>“That really was the driving force in implementing concurrent hunting there,” said Mr. Lau.</p>
