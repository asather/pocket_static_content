<h1>No-doctor-needed COVID-19 testing finds 22 new cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the operator of the Pittsburgh region’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/16/Pittsburgh-COVID-19-coronavirus-screening-test-drive-thru-central-outreach-wellness-center/stories/202003160125" target="_blank">only drive-thru COVID-19 test location</a> that does not require a doctor’s order to be tested, Stacy Lane knew at least some of the samples she and her staff are taking from patients would come back positive.</p>
<p>“That’s why we’re testing,” said Dr. Lane, founder of a 4-year-old, state-funded nonprofit clinic based in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>With roughly half of the 600 or so samples that her clinic —&nbsp;the Central Outreach Wellness Center —&nbsp;has collected so far, the result has been 22 positive cases. That’s about 7.5% of the samples testing positive, with more results expected over the next two days.</p>
<p>“I think among those, we are starting to see some secondary contact” cases that are signs of community spread, Dr. Lane said Tuesday afternoon while standing in the Pittsburgh Zoo’s parking lot in Highland Park, where her clinic staffers were testing people driving up in their cars.</p>
<p>That 7.5% positive case figure is lower than the roughly 10% positive cases that the state lab in Exton has found among its 8,600 samples, and the 11% positive cases Pittsburgh health system UPMC has found among about 1,000 samples it has tested at its own lab in Oakland.</p>
<p>But it is worth noting the overwhelming majority of people that Central Outreach has tested had been previously turned down for testing through conventional health care channels and are cases that would have gone untested without Dr. Lane’s no-doctor-note-needed testing.</p>
<p>“And I think our [7.5%] number skews low because we’re testing any police or health care worker with any type of symptoms,” she said.</p>
<p>Many of those police or health care workers would not necessarily have qualified for testing through a health care system because they could not demonstrate travel to an affected region or possible contact with a known infected person — which are still requirements under the federal testing guidelines.</p>
<p>Among those health care workers have been employees from both of the region’s largest health care providers, Allegheny Health Network and UPMC.</p>
<p>Dr. Lane said two of the positive results tested through her clinic so far have been local doctors.</p>
<p>Nate Wardle, a state Department of Health spokesman, said in an email that what Central Outreach has found was, to some degree, expected.</p>
<p>“We have been saying for well over a week that there are a number of individuals who will get the disease that we just don’t have the ability to test,” Mr. Wardle said in his email. “At our lab, we are prioritizing testing to health care workers, frontline responders, those who are 60+, those with underlying health issues and those in congregate settings.</p>
<p>“There is certainly a need for exact data on how many people get infected with COVID-19. But, our main focus is ensuring we do not overwhelm the health system. And that is why it is essential that if there are individuals who have symptoms, but they are mild, that they stay home. This will prevent the health system from being overwhelmed, and also prevent the spread of the virus.”</p>

<p>Dr. Lane believes that some of the people who have been turned away by her nonprofit — the clinic screens two people for every single person that they test —&nbsp;would have been positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>“We’re missing a lot more because we can’t test because of the criteria,” she said. “And we’re probably a bit more liberal with the criteria than others.”</p>
<p>It’s understandable that everyone still has to use the criteria to give a test, Dr. Lane said.</p>
<p>“It makes sense on some level,” she said. “Because [the test kits are] such a scarce resource right now.”</p>
<p>The only reason Central Outreach got so many test kits is because a friend put Dr. Lane in touch with the head of the local Quest Diagnostics’ laboratory two Saturdays ago to see if she might be able to do some testing on her own.</p>
<p>Quest said it would, and could, provide just 40 test kits. But Dr. Lane also heard that Quest’s local lab was in need of the sought-after N95 facemasks that Quest’s lab workers would need to wear to test the COVID-19 samples.</p>
<p>So she worked a trade: Even more test kits for some N95 masks that Dr. Lane’s clinic had in stock.</p>
<p>Initially, for the drive-thru samples that Central Outreach was doing last week, most of the samples were from sputum, which is the least accurate type of sample to test.</p>
<p>But on Thursday, Quest began providing some of the Roche Diagnostic’s new test kits, which use the more accurate nasal swab.</p>
<p>That allowed Central Outreach to test more than 600 people last week and through Monday. Final numbers for Tuesday’s testing weren’t complete.</p>
<p>Even if they have some test kits remaining, Dr. Lane said she is going to stop testing and evaluate what the clinic needs to do next —&nbsp;whether it’s more drive-thru testing, or more targeted testing for vulnerable populations, including nursing homes.</p>
<p>“We’re going to evaluate if we should continue to do it and how,” she said.</p>
<p>Another challenge that remains is funding.</p>
<p>The test kits were donated by Quest, which is also billing patients who have insurance to cover the actual testing cost.</p>
<p>But over and above that, Dr. Lane said it cost about $8,000 per day to run the drive-thru testing. That accounts for staffing and other expenses, including protective equipment.</p>
<p>She got some funding for two of the seven days the clinic has run the testing. But she is still looking for more to cover the other days.</p>
<p>“We’re looking to find a way to get some funding to help with this,” she said. “We’ll find some way to continue helping.”</p>
