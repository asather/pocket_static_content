They had been living at a home on Marr Road in Lawrence County.</p><p>The dogs appeared to be pit bulls and boxers.</p><p>“Numerous animals” were&nbsp;“found in unfit living conditions,” said township Patrolman Scott Hedland, in the department’s press release.&nbsp;“The animals were voluntarily surrendered” by the owners&nbsp;“and charges are pending at this time against the owners of the animals.”</p><p>The heading on the press release said&nbsp;“animal neglect” though the exact charges to be filed were not specified.</p><p>Mahoning Township officers assisted Wendi Wiegand, humane officer for the Lawrence County Humane Society, on the search and seizure. A spokesman there said the animals would not be taken to the shelter in New Castle.</p><p>Officer Hedland would not say where the animals were being taken, but he said they would be well cared for.&nbsp;</p><p>On Friday a man who identified himself as Cody Siders answered the phone at the Marr Road residence, where people witnessed animals being removed from the residence.&nbsp;</p><p>“They were filming it,” said Mr. Siders, who said he did not know who was doing the filming, but said he wants a copy of the film.&nbsp;</p><p>“As of right now I can not talk to you,” Mr. Siders told a reporter. “I am talking to an attorney. I will be glad to talk to you when this is over.”</p><p>The case has attracted the attention of PETA —&nbsp; People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.</p><p>Kristin Rickman, manager of PETA’s emergency response division of the cruelty investigations department, would not say who tipped the organization about the condition of the animals.</p><p>“We deal with cruelty complaints,” Ms. Rickman said. The identity of the person who reported the situation “is confidential.”</p><p>Ms. Rickman has not been to Lawrence County but said she recently sent letters to police officers and the humane society, voicing concern.&nbsp; “We apply pressure to get them to investigate,” she said.</p><p>Ingrid Newkirk, who founded PETA in 1980, started her career work with animals as a “humane officer,” Ms. Rickman said. Humane officers investigate and prosecute cases of animal abuse and neglect.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Linda Wilson Fuoco: lfuoco@post-gazette.com or 412-263-3064 or at PG Pets on Facebook.</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/01/03/Animals-removed-from-Lawrence-County-home-Mahoning-Township-Police-Lawrence-County-Humane-Society/stories/202001030136</original_url>
