<h1>Wes Kropp's bounceback performance leads Penn Hills over McKeesport</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Wes Kropp said he didn’t sleep very well most of this week, this after playing what he called one of the worst games of his career Tuesday in a win against Albert Gallatin.</p>
<p>His stat line that game — 0 of 3 from the field, 4 of 7 from the free-throw line, 4 points, 4 fouls.</p>
<p>Not exactly numbers you would expect from one of the top players in WPIAL Class 5A.</p>
<p>“I was in my room just thinking about it,” Kropp said. “As an athlete at Penn Hills, Penn Hills’ standard is winning. When you only have four points, you’re a starter and you were first-team all-section last year, that’s not acceptable. I just sat in my room and said, ‘Forget about that game.’”</p>
<p>Chances are the Penn Hills star will sleep like a baby this weekend.</p>
<p>Kropp, a 6-5 junior forward, finished with 22 points, 7 rebounds and a couple of pretty assists Friday, helping top-ranked Penn Hills rally from a halftime deficit to defeat visiting McKeesport, 78-64, and take firm control of the Section 1 lead.</p>
<p>“I told him, ‘This is redemption game for you. I’m going to go to you. You’re the guy.’ He did and I’m proud of him,” said Penn Hills coach Dan DeRose.</p>
<p>It was the 18th consecutive section win for Penn Hills (9-2, 5-0) dating to the 2017-18 season. Every other team in the section has at least two section losses this season, including McKeesport (6-6, 3-2), which lost for the fourth time in six games. Penn Hills’ only losses have been to Class 6A teams Fox Chapel and Central Catholic.</p>
<p>Kropp, who has gotten some attention around the WPIAL because of his advanced beard, clipped McKeesport’s defense with jump shots, floaters, putbacks and a dunk. Penn Hills trailed McKeesport, 35-31, at the half, but Kropp took over the game early in the third. He set up freshman Daemar Kelly with an assist and then scored consecutive baskets to give the Indians a 37-35 lead. They never trailed again.</p>
<p>The game featured an outstanding matchup of big man with Kropp going up against McKeesport’s Deamontae Diggs, who is 6-6. Diggs finished with 25 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
<p>McKeesport, which has been inconsistent this season, came in the underdog, but showed a lot of bite early, taking an 18-11 lead through one quarter before eventually holding the four-point halftime lead.</p>
<p>Penn Hills shot just 39 percent (11 of 28) from the field in the first half, but the Indians were much more efficient in the second half, shooting 65 percent (17 of 26). They outrebounded McKeesport, 41-36, and got a lot of second-chance baskets.</p>
<p>“I think our halftime lead should have been a little bigger,” said McKeesport coach Kevin Kovach. “I think the difference in the second half was them getting offensive rebounds. It was probably the first game we got outrebounded.”</p>
<p>Penn Hills closed the third quarter on a 10-3 run to take a 54-47 lead. McKeesport got no closer the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Guards Kyree Mitchell and Ed Daniels both came up big in the second half for Penn Hills. Mitchell scored 13 of his 19 points in the final two quarters and Daniels 12 of his 14.</p>
<p>Penn Hills, a WPIAL champion in 2018 and a semifinalist last season, continues to set itself up nicely for another playoff run.</p>
<p>“Everything is at stake,” DeRose said. “Not just the section, but positioning in the playoffs. If you can run the table or maybe only screw up once, you get the one or two seed. That’s what we’re shooting for.”</p>
