<h1>Pirates on pause: What's Chris Archer's future with the Pirates?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With MLB hoping to return soon, the Post-Gazette’s Jason Mackey and Mike Persak will analyze 20 issues related to the Pirates — think 20 Thoughts or questions about the team. They’ll run each weekday online through May 22 and will appear in print (or via other PG digital platforms) on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</em></p>
<p>Chris Archer was dealt a tough hand in Pittsburgh, but he hasn’t done himself any favors, either.</p>
<p>The veteran right-hander was traded to the Pirates back in 2018 for outfielder Austin Meadows, pitcher Tyler Glasnow and a player to be named later, who turned out to be right-hander Shane Baz.</p>
<p>The trade made some sense at the time. Even if Meadows and Glasnow were highly regarded prospects, Archer was still under team control for a few years, and the Pirates felt <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2018/08/03/chris-archer-pirates-trade-rumors-mlb-2018-neal-huntington/stories/201808050069" target="_blank">they would be able to compete in the coming years with Archer</a>, fresh off his second All-Star season, leading the rotation.</p>
<p>As is well-known by now, things have soured since. Meadows made his first All-Star game in 2019, hitting .291 with 33 homers and 89 RBIs. Glasnow showed real promise with the Rays before an arm injury put him on the injured list for most of the season, but his success and youth still make him a valuable commodity. Even if Archer had been really good, the trade likely would have been scrutinized. But Archer also had the worst season of his career in 2019, finishing with a 3-9 record and a 5.19 ERA.</p>
<p>But we aren’t necessarily here to revisit the past, we’re here to look to the future in an attempt to analyze what Archer’s role with the Pirates might be down the road, however long that road may be.</p>
<p>To start off, here are the facts. 2020 is the last year of Archer’s current contract, but he does have a team option that, if triggered by the Pirates, would keep him in Pittsburgh in 2021 for $11 million.</p>
<p>He is currently the highest-paid player on the roster for 2020 at $9 million. If the Pirates exercise his team option, he would be the second-highest paid player in 2021, only trailing right fielder Gregory Polanco.</p>
<p>So the shortest answer here might simply be that Archer’s road in Pittsburgh is extremely short. With the current contracts that are in place, $11 million would make Archer the 34th-highest-paid pitcher in baseball next season, placing him right between Tampa Bay’s Blake Snell ($11.1) and the Yankees’ Luis Severino ($10.75). Snell battled some injuries last year, and Severino underwent Tommy John surgery in February, but a key difference between the three is that Snell and Severino are 27 and 26 years old, respectively. Archer is 31.</p>
<p>Simply cutting bait and letting Archer walk is not preferable either. In one sense, it would be halting the ripples from the 2018 trade on the Pirates’ end, more or less eliminating the possibility of getting a substantial positive out of it. More likely, the use for Archer from the Pirates’ perspective, with where they are as a franchise, would be to use him as a trade piece.</p>
<p>For a contender, Archer would be an experienced pitcher with a strong past who has at least another year of team control, should that team want it. One would think that would draw some bidders.</p>
<p>For that to happen, though, Archer simply needs to turn things around. At spring training, he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/02/10/pittsburgh-pirates-spring-training-chris-archer-houston-astros-cheating/stories/202002100102" target="_blank">discussed going back to his old routines</a>. In short, that means trusting himself and his stuff. It means eliminating excess thoughts, not trying to pitch to contact, believing in his two best pitches — his four-seamer and slider — and becoming the strikeout monster that he was in Tampa Bay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He showed glimpses of being the old, two-time All-Star in the back half of last season. In his third-to-last start before a shoulder/biceps injury ended his season, he went seven innings against the St. Louis Cardinals, striking out nine batters while giving up two runs. His next outing, he struck out 10 Los Angeles Angels. Archer struck out more batters per nine innings (10.8) than all but one season in his career. Then the injury came, and it was over in a flash.</p>
<p>If Archer picks up in 2020 where he left off, he suddenly becomes a valuable trade asset.&nbsp;Even if it doesn’t happen, the Pirates could exercise the team option for 2021, run it back and hope he can be a trade piece then.</p>
<p>The third option would be Archer sticking around for another contract. That seems unlikely, given that the Pirates are probably not ready for contention yet and could use more organizational depth. Plus, an Archer departure opens up spots for the younger guys in the Pirates’ system to get a chance.</p>
<p>That could mean Mitch Keller, Joe Musgrove, Steven Brault and Trevor Williams, maybe. It could also mean a healthy Jameson Taillon or minor leaguers Brennan Malone and Quinn Priester. Some of those names are more likely to be Pirates than others, but the point is that Archer taking up a spot in the rotation doesn’t necessarily do them any favors, unless the Pirates are making a playoff push.</p>
<p>Both the Pirates and Archer would probably say their ideal situation would be to compete, together, for a World Series in Pittsburgh. Right now, that doesn’t appear likely to happen. The next best option for competing, then, would be for the Pirates to find a trade partner for an improved Archer, send him there to compete for a title and get a return to bolster the farm system.</p>
<p>The positive is that all parties involved seem to believe Archer has some run left in him. Whether that’s true or not probably matters more for Archer and his fate with the Pirates than anything else.</p>
<p><strong>STATISTICALLY SPEAKING:&nbsp;</strong>Chris Archer issued 4.14 walks per nine innings last season, the fifth-highest rate among all MLB starters who threw at least 100 innings.</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THIS:&nbsp;</strong>From 2014-2017, Chris Archer accumulated the fifth-most strikeouts (907) of any pitcher in baseball.</p>
<p><strong>THEY SAID IT:&nbsp;</strong>“As long as you’re handling your business, you have to do things your way because when it’s all said and done and you look back at your career, in whatever profession you're in, the mistakes and successes were all me. I didn’t make a mistake because I was trying to do something that wasn’t who I was.” — Chris Archer</p>
