<h1>Pitt's Pat Narduzzi, Heather Lyke ranked mid-pack among ACC peers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pat Narduzzi and Heather Lyke have some work to do to improve their perception nationally.</p>
<p>Pitt’s football coach and athletic director received mediocre reviews in rankings published Thursday by CBS and Stadium.com. The lists evaluated how the two stack up among ACC peers.</p>
<p>Narduzzi was ranked ninth in <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/acc-coach-rankings-2020-clemsons-on-field-dominance-keeps-dabo-swinney-well-above-the-field/" target="_blank">Chip Patterson’s pecking order for CBS</a>, which was led by Clemson’s Dabo Swinney. That’s an improvement from 11th a year ago, but still puts him in the bottom half of the 15-team league.</p>
<p>“The Panthers have logged three 8-win seasons in Narduzzi's five-year run, and that doesn't even include the late-season surge that powered the ACC Coastal Division title in 2018,” Patterson write. “You can always count on Narduzzi's teams to be up to the task of competing with the best in the country, but the Panthers have also lost at least five games each season of Narduzzi's tenure.”</p>
<p>Narduzzi ranked 40th on an overall list by Patterson’s <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/2020-college-football-coach-rankings-chip-kelly-falls-among-power-five-coaches-ranked-65-26/" target="_blank">CBS colleague Tom Fornelli</a>. Penn State’s James Franklin was ninth overall and <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/big-ten-coach-rankings-2020-james-franklin-stays-at-the-top-but-ryan-day-closes-the-gap/" target="_blank">first in the Big Ten</a> conference.</p>
<p>Lyke, meanwhile, fared a bit worse in Jeff Goodman and Brett McMurphy’s <a href="https://watchstadium.com/ranking-the-acc-ads-with-jeff-goodman-and-brett-mcmurphy-06-10-2020/" target="_blank">list for Stadium</a> that graded coach hirings in football and men’s basketball.</p>
<p>Her overall grade of C+ put her 10th out of 12 athletic directors on the list. Three were excluded because they have not made any hires. Lyke has made two across stints at Pitt and Eastern Michigan.</p>
<p>“Lyke’s most significant hire at EMU was football coach Chris Creighton,” Goodman and McMurphy wrote. “Before Creighton arrived, the Eagles had only one bowl appearance in 39 years and experienced 20 consecutive losing seasons. In Creighton’s last four seasons, the Eagles have been to three bowls and had two winning records (the school only had six in the previous 41 years). At Pitt, Lyke hired basketball coach Jeff Capel with the task of rebuilding the program after two brutal seasons under former coach Kevin Stallings.”</p>
<p>Only Duke’s Kevin White (C+) and Georgia Tech’s Todd Stansbury (C-) had an equal or worse ranking. Notre Dame’s Jack Swarbrick topped the list with an A grade.</p>
<p>Elsewhere Thursday, Pitt defensive end Jaylen Twyman and Penn State linebacker Micah Parsons were named to the Walter Camp Football Foundation’s All-American first team.</p>
