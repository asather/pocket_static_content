<p>Uniontown police are investigating a fatal drive-by shooting that left one man dead Friday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uniontown police Lt. Tom Kolencik said police responded to the scene of 136 Evans St. around around 10:20 p.m. Friday, where one man was pronounced deceased upon arrival.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lt. Kolencik said the incident is considered a drive-by shooting. According to Lt. Kolencik, three males were sitting in a car in front of a home in the 100 block of Evans Street when a car drove by and fired “multiple shots” into the parked car. The male victim, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, sustained two gunshot wounds in “vital areas of his body,” according to Lt. Kolencik. The other two men in the car were not injured, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lt. Kolencik said police are still conducting interviews with witnesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some names are trickling in and we’re following up on those,” Lt. Kolencik said.&nbsp;“The biggest thing we’re up against is we did our part, along with state police in regards to forensic evidence, electronic evidence and interviewing people on scene. What we’re up against is we’re getting half-truths. And we need whole truths. We’ve interviewed a handful of people who have been forthcoming with every detail but some haven’t. We’ve had people that, one person was in the car, refused to at this point even talk to us.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody with information can call Pittsburgh Crime Stoppers at 412-255-8477 or the Uniontown Police at 724-430-2929. Callers can remain anonymous.</p>
