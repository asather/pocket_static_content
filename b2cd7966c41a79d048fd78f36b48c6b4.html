<h1>Visit Aviary birds for free and do yoga with goats</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The National Aviary is closed to the public because of coronavirus, but some of the birds live outside the North Side building, facing Arch Street, so the public can do some bird watching for free.</p>
<p>You can add the visit to walks through Allegheny Commons Park, where the bird zoo is located, and nearby West Park.&nbsp;Visitors should socially distance themselves from other people.</p>
<p>The big Andean condors, Lurch and Lianni are incubating their mango-sized egg.</p>
<p>The Laughing Kookaburra birds recently were moved outside in the Condor Court habitat because they like being outside in the summer, according to staff.</p>
<p>A reduced number of staff are inside the aviary taking care of 543 birds and seven mammals, including three popular sloths and four giant bats.</p>
<p>The Kookaburras, native to Australia, are named Giggles and Mrs. Giggles, according to the aviary.org. And yes, the bird calls they make do sound like laughter.</p>
<p>Also on view outside are Demoiselle cranes, brilliantly hued golden pheasants, King vultures and hamerkops, which are medium-sized wading birds.</p>
<p>Lurch, the male condor, and Lianni, the female, take turns sitting on the egg, which is expected to hatch in early June. It’s fairly easy to tell them apart — The female has a bald head, while the male’s head is topped by a crest.</p>
<p>Each condor weighs 25 pounds, and observers may see them display their 10-foot wingspans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The breeding couple and their egg are important because Andean condors are “critically endangered” in Ecuador and&nbsp;“threatened” throughout much of their range in other South American countries.</p>
<p><strong>Goat yoga is back</strong></p>
<p>NamastHay Goat Yoga is back because the event is held in a big field on a farm with plenty of space for social distancing. The event will be 2-3:30 p.m. June 6 at Potential Farm. The $20 tickets should be purchased in advance online.</p>
<p>The official name of the event is NamastHay Goat Yoga of Pittsburgh to Benefit Forever Home Beagle Rescue. Go to <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">www.eventbrite.com</a>&nbsp;and type that name into the search box to get information and to order tickets. There is also a Facebook event page with that name.</p>
<p>Goats and their kids will mix and mingle with people on mats doing yoga.</p>
<p>Fewer tickets will be sold than past events to allow for safe social distancing. Participants must wear masks until they get to the field with their yoga mats.</p>
<p>The event is presented by Jen’s Yoga Zen and Have You Herd Goatscaping. Potential Farm is located at 101 Boyd’s Run Road, Presto&nbsp;15142.</p>
