<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: Is the Pirates bullpen really as bad as it's been so far?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @PaulZeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com. Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> How can the Pirates bullpen be as bad as it has been so far? I know there have been some injuries, but they should be better than they are.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I think it will be erratic all year, but I don’t think it will he as bad as it has been. Kyle Crick obviously wasn’t healthy, so getting him right will help. Richard Rodriguez is what he is — when he is good, he is really good; when he isn’t, he stinks. Michael Feliz is another one who is inconsistent. Nick Burdi has helped. Keone Kela coming back could help, but he has had times when he has been erratic as well.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong> What is the Pirates best overall lineup in your mind? And is that different than their best defensive lineup?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong>&nbsp;I would say their best lineup right now is: an outfield of Gregory Polanco in right, Jarrod Dyson in center, Bryan Reynolds in left; an infield of Jose Osuna at first, Adam Frazier at second, Kevin Newman at short, Colin Moran at third and Jacob Stallings at catcher. The best defensive lineup has John Ryan Murphy at catcher, Newman, Cole Tucker and Ke’Bryan Hayes at second, shortstop and third and then Heredia, Dyson and Reynolds in the outfield.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> I read your story Tuesday and am still dumbfounded that you don’t think Neal Huntington did a good job. How can you say this? They have had four winning seasons since Barry Bonds, and he put together those four teams.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> That’s not what I wrote. I wrote that Huntington inherited a better situation than he handed off. Huntington inherited the core players and trade pieces needed to build a playoff team. Ben Cherington has not. That’s the difference. Huntington did a good job early on, but his last four years were mostly dismal.</p>
<p><strong>Randy:</strong> If Nick Burdi keeps doing what he has done, will he eventually be the official closer?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> One thing to keep in mind is his injury history, so I’m not sure if they can use him night after night. He might need rest in between appearances, which isn’t ideal. If he continues to pitch well, he would be a great trade piece later in the season for a contending team needing a closer.</p>

<p><strong>Greg:</strong> Do you think it is irresponsible that baseball is still playing even though there was a major outbreak? In any other profession, they would be made to shut down. Why are sports above the law?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> There was one team that had an outbreak. That team is not playing until next week. If the plan is to shut down at every positive case, then don’t start playing at all. We knew this was going to happen, so the fact some are acting shocked is silly. So far, it’s been handled appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> I’m already worn out by all the political crap that is in sports and all the demonstrations and public service commercial. I don’t need a lecture; I just want to watch sports. Will we ever get back to the point where we can just watch sports and be entertained?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Let’s hope so because it has gotten way out of hand. Sports are supposed to be a nice diversion from the real world, a place people can escape for a few hours. What is going on now has turned into annoying background noise, and most of it is not necessary. I have no issue with people voicing their opinion. I have a big issue with pandering and bandwagon jumping.</p>
