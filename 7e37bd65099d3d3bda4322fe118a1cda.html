<p>Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board expect to be at the scene of Sunday's fatal turnpike crash for the next five to seven days "collecting the facts," an NTSB spokesman said Monday.</p>
<p>Eric Weiss said the NTSB will conduct its investigation "with an eye on what we can improve toward safety recommendations nationwide."</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, a passenger bus traveling westbound on the turnpike on its way to Ohio from New York City lost control, went up and embankment, flipped over and caused a chain-reaction that involved three tractor trailers and a passenger car.</p>
<p>Five people were killed and about 60 more were injured.</p>
<p>Mr. Weiss said the NTSB will work with Pennsylvania state police but will be "running a parallel separate, safety investigation into the scene of the crash, aimed at finding any issues for recommendations to make national transportation improvements."</p>
<p>Lane closures between the Donegal and New Stanton exits are possible while the NTSB conducts its investigation at the scene of the crash, Mr. Weiss said, but the turnpike will remain open.</p>
<p>After its initial investigation, the NTSB may return if there is a need for more interviews, Mr. Weiss said.</p>
<p>The entire investigation could take up to two years, he said.</p>
