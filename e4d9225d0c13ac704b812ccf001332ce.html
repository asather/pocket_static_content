<h1>PIHL cancels remainder of high school hockey season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A month after the PIAA canceled all winter championships and spring sports, the PIHL was still holding out hope that it would be able to finish up the high school hockey season.</p>
<p>That hope ended Sunday when the league announced that it has canceled the rest of the 2019-20 season.</p>
<p>So, for the first time since Western Pennsylvania high school hockey championships began in 1975, there wonâ€™t be any champions crowned this season. The Penguins Cup playoffs were nearing their end when the pandemic caused the PIHL to suspend all events for two weeks on March 12. They were then suspended indefinitely.</p>
<p>The Class 3A playoffs were in the semifinal round, while Class 2A, Class 1A and Class B were set to play their championship games. Baldwin and Latrobe were to meet in the 2A final, Thomas Jefferson and Indiana in the 1A final, and Carrick and Ringgold in the B final. North Allegheny, Pine-Richland, Seneca Valley and Peters Townships were the 3A semifinalists.</p>
<p>The PIHL is not affiliated with the PIAA. The PIAA announced its cancellations April 9.</p>
