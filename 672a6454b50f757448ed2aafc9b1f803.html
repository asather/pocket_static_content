<h1>Steelers hire ex-Pitt assistant Matt Canada as quarterbacks coach</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers have hired former Pitt offensive coordinator Matt Canada to be their quarterbacks coach, giving them a full-time assistant at the most important position on the team.</p>
<p>Randy Fichtner has served as quarterback coach since 2010, but it became a dual role when he was promoted to offensive coordinator before the 2018 season.</p>
<p>The job became more important this season when the Steelers had to use two quarterbacks who had never appeared in an NFL game — Mason Rudolph and Devlin Hodges — after Ben Roethlisberger was injured.</p>
<p>Canada was Pitt’s offensive coordinator in 2016 when the Panthers averaged 42 points per game. He left the following year to become offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach at LSU. Canada also served as interim coach at Maryland in 2018.</p>
