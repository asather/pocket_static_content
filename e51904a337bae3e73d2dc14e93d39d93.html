<h1>A raccoon rabies vaccine is being airdropped — again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Look up. If pairs of helicopters in tight formation are slowly crisscrossing over your neighborhood, relax. They’re not looking for you.</p>
<p>The flights are part of an inter-agency wildlife rabies prevention program that is dropping oral vaccination packets throughout Western Pennsylvania. The smelly bait packets are distributed in prime raccoon habitat. A raccoon that eats it will develop immunity to the rabies virus.</p>
<p>The National Rabies Management Program, a federal initiative operating from Maine to Alabama, was started with the ambitious goal of stopping raccoon-spread rabies among wild animals in the United States.</p>
<p>In August, the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Wildlife Services is distributing the vaccine in Allegheny, Beaver, Crawford, Erie, Fayette, Greene, Lawrence, Mercer, Washington and Westmoreland counties. More than 300,000 vaccination baits are being dropped from helicopters or by hand in some areas.</p>
<p>A local partnership in the program linking the Allegheny County Health Department and USDA is marking its 19th year. With help from the county departments of Human Services and Parks, Pittsburgh City Parks and Pennsylvania Game Commission, USDA is leading the mission to drop the baits throughout Allegheny County’s 130 municipalities.</p>
<p>By mid-July, Allegheny County Public Health had confirmed rabies in 14 animals: a groundhog, three feral cats, five bats and five raccoons. By comparison, 25 cases of rabies were confirmed in the county in all of 2019.</p>
<p>All mammals, including humans, are susceptible to rabies. While coyotes are known to eat the vaccination bait, it was designed for raccoons.</p>
<p>“The rabies virus has adapted to various mammals, but this variety transmits very well in raccoons making them the No. 1 vector in the United States,” said Joanne Maki, a veterinary scientist from Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, maker of the Raboral V-RG wildlife vaccine used in the program.</p>
<p>“Raccoons have adapted very well to the suburban habitat. They are extremely smart and versatile, and use humans as a food supplier.”</p>
<p>Rabies is common globally, but is probably not native to North America. Some researchers think it may have been transmitted to the Colonial Southeast via dogs on sailing ships in the 1700s. The virus is typically transmitted through the saliva or scratches of an infected animal. It attaches itself to the central nervous system, travels along the nerves up the spinal column to the brain. It gets into the salivary glands causing foaming of the mouth and transmission through bites. Rabies causes dementia and coma. Without treatment, death occurs in 99% of cases. With quick treatment, rabies can usually be cured.</p>
<p>After the vaccine was successfully used in Europe, its developer focused on rabies’ public health risk in the United States.</p>
<p>“It was a long shot trying to say we could ‘prevent’ rabies in wildlife and from harming people. It’s a big ask,” said Ms. Maki. “But the company said it was worth the time and investment to develop this product for use in America.”</p>
<p>Small waterproof bags of liquid Raboral are hidden in wax-covered sachets&nbsp;covered in smelly fish meal. The baits are distributed in airdrops; smaller baits are driven to places more accessible by car and delivered by hand. They are not harmful to people, pets or other wild animals.</p>
<p>“The smell is repellent to people but attracts raccoons from quite a distance,” said Ms. Maki. “They bite into the bait, puncture the bag and swallow the liquid vaccine. It is unique in that it is oral.”</p>
<p>The strategy is to create vaccination zones where rabies is geographically eliminated. Unable to spread through the zones, it would theoretically become a minor risk. The process is far from complete, but Ms. Maki cites a regional success.</p>
<p>“It was used in South Texas, where rabid dogs in Mexico were infecting coyotes that crossed the border and infected domestic dogs,” she said. “The baits were used to vaccinate coyotes and people had their dogs vaccinated, and we were able to drive it back to Mexico.”</p>
