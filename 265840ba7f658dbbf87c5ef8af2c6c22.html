<h1>Matt Murray, Tristan Jarry will both see action vs. Flyers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Matt Murray will start in goal Tuesday in Toronto — but there’s a catch.</p>
<p>Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said Tuesday morning that Murray and Tristan Jarry are splitting Tuesday’s exhibition game against the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t come as a surprise. Sullivan over the years has always tried to keep the identity of his starting goalie hidden until just before the puck dropped. The coach may just be making the Montreal Canadiens wonder for a few more days. Plus, it isn’t the worst idea to get both goalies some game action.</p>
<p>Still, Murray getting the start Tuesday suggests that is the direction Sullivan is leaning for Game 1 of the qualifying-round series. If he prefers Jarry, why would he make him come off the bench cold in his only exhibition tune-up?</p>
<p>Anyway, we, too, may be wondering what he is thinking until Saturday.&nbsp;We’ve been waiting four months for the answer. What’s another four days?</p>
<p>As for Sidney Crosby, Sullivan wouldn’t say if he will suit up against the Flyers. The coach said his captain will go through his normal game-day routine and the Penguins will decide Tuesday afternoon if he plays.&nbsp;The game begins at 4 p.m.</p>
