<h1>Q&amp;A: PIAA director on spring sports cancellation, football without fans and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As executive director of the PIAA, Bob Lombardi is used to fielding questions. But the questions now are more than ever for the boss of high school sports in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>After Gov. Tom Wolf announced Thursday that all Pennsylvania schools will be closed for the rest of the school year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PIAA announced the cancellation of all spring sports and also winter championships in basketball and Class 2A swimming and diving.</p>
<p>Everyone, from athletes and coaches to fans and school administrators, has questions about both the past and the future of high school sports. Lombardi has been an administrator with the PIAA since 1988 and the executive director since 2012. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette threw some questions his way about a number of subjects:</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> If the governor hadn’t closed schools for the rest of the year, would the PIAA have waited to make a decision on spring sports and winter championships?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong>Was there a deadline date to make a decision?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We had one in mind, but there was nothing official. The preliminary closing of the schools was to end at the end of April. We were going to wait until the end of April and see where we were then.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Ohio released plans Thursday for a shortened spring season if schools go back. Did the PIAA have plans for a shortened season if schools went back in May?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We did not put out concrete dates or give information to our membership. We’ve seen people do that and then have to retract it. They get beat up for giving false hope. We wanted to be patient. Did we put out a concrete plan? No. But as a staff, did we have an idea of how certain things could be done? Yes. However, a big part is commitment from membership that we didn’t know if we had, as far as hosting games or letting students go to other campuses for games.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Was there ever any thought of trying to play the basketball championships even in July?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> There wasn’t a possibility out there that we, as a staff, didn’t knock around. We knocked around A to Z. But every solution has a number of hurdles with it. A lot of it starts with sites. Would schools be willing to host a game, or willing to travel to another school for a game?</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>How big of a financial hit is it for the PIAA to not have basketball championships?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Certainly, it makes an impact because we lost one-third of our championship seasons.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Aren’t the basketball championships big for you guys?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Sure, just based on the number of games.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Will you have to be creative financially in the future?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We’re in the middle of exploring a lot of opportunities. The CARES Act that was just passed (by Congress) for nonprofits and small businesses may help us. But we are a non-essential business and we haven’t been in the office and haven’t been able to close our books yet. We need time to take a snapshot of where we are, but we did lose one-third of our championship seasons, so it will have an impact.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Possibly in the summer, will it be up to schools to decide when to allow fall sport workouts to start?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;We can’t answer that yet. That will be forthcoming.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>What do you think of high school football games with no fans?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I would hope it wouldn’t come to that. Part of the beauty of high school football is that it rallies a community. It’s engrained in our state that football is one of the exciting things, not just for a community, but for the students, the bands, the cheerleaders, drill teams, people running the concession stands. It’s more than just a game. I hope it wouldn’t get to that, but it’s too early to make a prediction.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>The PIAA has that new “competition formula” that would maybe bump some basketball teams up in classification next year. Where does that stand since the basketball championships weren’t completed?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> More information on that will be forthcoming. But you can’t take away that we did play two rounds of the basketball playoffs. Teams made it to the quarterfinals. A decision will be forthcoming. Everything isn’t final today. This is a work in progress.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Aren’t there so many questions that you don’t have answers for yet?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> When it came out that the schools were closing, I think it was somewhat surprising to some schools. There are a whole lot of questions that in the next week, or few weeks, or next few months that we will be able to address. But it’s premature right now to look into a crystal ball and say, ‘this, this and this.’</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Do you think people don’t understand how hard of a decision this was for the PIAA to cancel sports?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Are you guys sad about it? Yes, very much so. The health of the communities and the safety of everyone is the No. 1 priority. But because we’re in this athletics business, it’s important to us. It’s important to us because it’s part of the school day for many students. People have said, having sports would help for a return to normal life conditions. But a lot of school activities have been affected and that’s disappointing. Like the spring play, proms, graduations, honors nights. It we can’t get together for those, either, it’s tremendously disappointing. This is far bigger than athletics.</p>
