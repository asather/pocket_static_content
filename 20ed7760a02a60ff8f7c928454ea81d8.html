<h1>Brillobox in Bloomfield will say goodbye after 15-year run</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The owners of Brillobox shocked patrons Monday morning with the news that the Bloomfield bar, restaurant and music is closing.</p>
<p>Lou Ickes and Janessa Walter posted on the Brillobox Facebook page:&nbsp;“15 years!!!!</p>
<p>“But it’s time to say “Good-bye” and more importantly: “THANK-YOU!!!!</p>
<p>“We are wrapping it up. We appreciate everyone that has been a part of Brillo, over the years. It’s been a great ride, but it’s time to move on. We love you all. Thank you again!!! Lou and Janessa.”</p>

<p>For almost two decades, Brillobox, which replaced the long-running folk/blues club Penn Cafe, was a haven for the city’s indie-rock scene as well as the Pandemic dance party (before there was an actual pandemic) and comedy nights.</p>
<p>Over the course of its run, it played host to such touring bands as Sebadoh, Legendary Pink Dots, !!!, PUP, Cloud Nothings, Future Islands and Imagine Dragons (as an opening act)..</p>
<p>Greensburg native Ickes, a former sales rep for Snap-On Tools, and his wife Janessa have been running Brillobox since 2005. They purchased the club in 2016 from original owner Eric Stern, who is married to Ickes’ sister and owns the building.</p>
<p>Asked Monday morning if it’s because of the impact of COVID, Ickes declined to go into details but said in a text, “It’s from the COVID. We rely on folks coming to shows, events, parties ... being cozy and hanging out with friends. When that is gone, the soul was sucked out. There’s just zero chance to keep it going. It’s like driving a car, running out of gas...on a road you don’t know...and praying there’s a gas station near.”</p>
<p>In March, he told the Start the Beat podcast,&nbsp;“Every day I wake up and try to find a way to do it, and every day I seem to find one.”</p>
<p>Combined with the closing of Howler’s on Liberty Avenue, it’s another blow to the once-thriving East End music scene.</p>
<p>The Pandemic Dance Party commented: “Thanks for 15 years of magic. This place has truly been a home to Pandemic and so many great monthly parties. Lou and Janessa and the entire staff are truly remarkable individuals and Pittsburgh isn’t going to be the same. I wish you the best and will always cherish the memories. Cheers to you!”</p>
<p>Jon Stefaniak, of the punk band F--- Yeah, Dinosaurs!, posted, “Such a bummer. So many good shows upstairs... another gem lost in our chunk of town.”</p>
<p>Drag performer Bebe Beretta added, “Thank you for being great to us drag performers over the years. Many good memories performing here. Best of luck on your future plans!”</p>
<p>Josh Verbanets, of Meeting of Important People, posted, “brillobox was the place where my little music community developed, a spot where I felt like I could be myself for maybe the first time as a young adult and where songs and ideas started to connect with an audience beyond our moms n dads. Lohio and MOIP album release shows, pretty much getting to know most of the friends I have to this day (across the floor from others meeting their spouses), workshopping childrens songs with Gab Bonesso at her comedy nights. A huge thanks to Brillobox for some of the best memories of my life, and sending positive thoughts that its owners &amp; staff will come back with new concepts and businesses to delight Pittsburghers in this difficult world.”</p>
