<h1>Paul Zeise: Steelers have to tighten up pass coverage to be a championship defense</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers sacked Broncos quarterbacks a total of seven times Sunday in a 26-21 win at Heinz Field. It was yet another dominant performance by the Steelers’ front seven.</p>
<p>The front seven is nasty. They are going to make life miserable for quarterbacks and opposing running backs all season long. The Broncos did get to 100 yards rushing, but they struggled to have an effective and consistent rushing attack all game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no question the Steelers defense is going to get to quarterbacks and win the battle at the point of attack more often than not. T.J. Watt and Bud Dupree are a nightmare from the outside, Tyson Alualu is a disruptive force and one of the most underrated players on the defense — and maybe in the AFC North.</p>
<p>All of that has been fun to watch and will be all season, but it also has masked the one thing this defense will need to get better at if the Steelers are going to be a championship team. Broncos quarterback Jeff Driskel didn’t have a lot of time to throw the ball and he got hit a lot, but when he did have some time, more often than not he had open receivers to throw to, and that is a problem.</p>
<p>The Steelers need to tighten up in coverage, especially their linebackers, before they get to the part of their schedule when they start playing better quarterbacks and teams. Driskel nearly led the Broncos to a comeback victory because the Steelers gave up too many chunk plays in the second half.</p>
<p>Driskel was able to pick the Steelers apart for 256 yards and two touchdowns and had them driving for a go-ahead touchdown late in the game. Not surprisingly, the Steelers sealed their win with a sack of Driskel on a fourth-and-2 play, but it was an example of the way things had played out for much of the second half because had the Broncos blocked it correctly, he had at least two open receivers underneath.</p>
<p>Seven different Broncos receivers caught passes, and six of them caught at least one pass that went for more than 15 yards. The Steelers linebackers got lost on a few crossing routes and some simple patterns, and even the vaunted corners both got beat on at least one big play.</p>
<p>Broncos standout receiver Courtland Sutton left the game with an injury but not before he torched the Steelers for three receptions that went for 66 yards. Had he stayed in the game, it might have been a different result because the Steelers had some issues covering him.</p>
<p>Devin Bush had seven tackles and is excellent at finding the ball carrier, but he still is making rookie mistakes in Year 2 in coverage. He is athletic and fast and physical, but he now needs to use all of that speed and natural ability to become much better in coverage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safety Terrell Edmunds got the sack on Driskel that ended the game. That was a great play by him and couldn’t have come at a better time. Had he not made that play and the Broncos went on to score a touchdown and win, the play most people would be talking about would be the pass interference penalty he took earlier in the drive that helped put the Broncos in position to score.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edmunds has had very mixed results in both of the Steelers’ games. Corners Joe Haden and Steven Nelson are both solid and consistent, but both also have to tighten up their coverage a little bit as the level of competition gets better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn’t to say the Steelers can’t cover. It is to say that they have to clean this area of their defensive game up a little bit. They can’t let receivers get open so much and they can’t get lost as much as they have in the first two games. The schedule allows them a few more weeks to figure some things out, though, as they won’t play many dominant passing attacks early in the year. But they will have some games where their front seven won’t be able to bail them out.</p>
<p>The Steelers defense has a chance to be dominant and so far has shown flashes of that. The offense is going to continue to improve each week as Ben Roethlisberger and his receivers get more time to play together. The defensive front seven is going to do their thing, too. If the Steelers can improve their coverage in the secondary to a level of play close to that of the front seven, then there is no reason they can’t be Super Bowl contenders this year.&nbsp;</p>
