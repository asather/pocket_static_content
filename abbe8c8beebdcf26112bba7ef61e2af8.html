<h1>Pittsburgh mayor outlines push for police reforms in wake of George Floyd death</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto on Thursday called for "white elected officials" to step up as he proposed reforms to police use-of-force policies in the wake of the Memorial Day death of George Floyd while in police custody.</p>
<p>"Now is the time to show your support," Mr. Peduto directed at state lawmakers during remarks at a press conference outside the City-County Building Downtown. "We are calling on every other white elected official to support and sponsor these bills.</p>
<p>"Being quiet is not where the state needs to be."</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto was referring to the use-of-force bill introduced by Democratic state legislators last year governing use of deadly force during arrests. The bill never made it to a vote, however.</p>
<p>The mayor's office also highlighted its "8 Can't Wait" campaign, which calls for:</p>
<p>• Officers to de-escalate situations before using force</p>
<p>• Have force matrix in use of force policy, defining weapons/types of force</p>
<p>• Officers to give verbal warning before deadly force</p>
<p>• Explicitly prohibit chokeholds and strangleholds or limit these tactics</p>
<p>• Prohibits officers from shooting at people in moving vehicles unless person is deadly threat</p>
<p>• Officers to exhaust all other reasonable alternatives before using deadly force</p>
<p>• Officers to intervene to stop another officer from using excessive force</p>
<p>• Officers to report all uses of force, including threatening a civilian with a firearm</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto also said he supports annual implicit bias and de-escalation training for city police. Pittsburgh officers already undergo such training, but the mayor said he would like to see it done “more regularly.”</p>
