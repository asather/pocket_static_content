<h1>Cornell expected to hire Sean Crummie as boys basketball coach</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Crummie family coaching tree is about to grow another branch.</p>
<p>Sean Crummie is expected to be named the new boys basketball coach at Cornell High School. Cornell athletic director Bill Sacco, who also was the former coach, confirmed that Crummie is the recommended candidate, but is not officially the coach until the Cornell school board approves him at a meeting Thursday. Crummie said he would rather not comment until he is officially hired.</p>
<p>Sean Crummie is the son of former Central Catholic coach Chuck Crummie, the seventh-winningest coach in WPIAL history with a record of 635-351 in 39 seasons. Crummie’s oldest son, Devin, was Allderdice’s head coach this past season.</p>
<p>Sean Crummie, 40, played for his father at Central Catholic and then played football at Yale. Cornell will be his first head coaching job. He was an assistant at old Oliver High School in the City League for three years before becoming an assistant under his father for 15 years (2004-19). When Central Catholic ousted Chuck Crummie as coach in 2019, Sean Crummie left and spent this past season as an assistant at North Allegheny.</p>
<p>Sean Crummie is a math teacher at Central Catholic. He takes over for Sacco, who retired after guiding Cornell to the WPIAL Class 1A championship game this past season. Sacco coached boys and girls basketball at three different schools for 34 years and had a 484-34 record. Crummie will take over a Cornell team that lost all five of its starters to graduation.</p>
<p><strong>Other coaching hires</strong></p>
<p>• Cornell also is expected to name Frank Deutsch as the new girls coach Thursday. Deutsch has ties to Cornell basketball. He was the boys coach for two seasons (2000-02) before Sacco took over.</p>
<p>• As expected, Penn-Trafford hired Doug Kelly as its new boys coach Monday. He succeeds Jim Rocco, who resigned after this past season. Kelly spent a few years as an assistant under Rocco, but Kelly has head coaching experience. He was Franklin Regional’s coach for eight seasons (2001-09) and his 2008 team was 20-8 with a section championship.</p>
