<p>Germany’s Oktoberfest was officially canceled on Tuesday, the world-famous European event joining&nbsp;the latest cancellations announced in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Oktoberfest — Munich’s annual festival of beer-drinking, mug-swinging people packed together in massive tents — will not take place in 2020 because of concerns over the spread of the coronavirus, the authorities in the southern state of Bavaria said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Drinkers from around the world convene in Munich every fall for the event, which has become a symbol of southern German culture, as well as a highly lucrative tourist draw that last year generated $1.33 billion for the city.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>But the authorities acknowledged that it would not be possible to enforce safe social distancing or the wearing of face masks among the millions of revelers during the festival, which was scheduled to run from Sept. 19 to Oct. 4.</p>
<p>“We are living in changed times,” Markus Söder, the governor of Bavaria, said as he announced the decision alongside the mayor of Munich. “Living with corona means living cautiously.”</p>
<p>This year will not be the first year in its 210-year history that Oktoberfest has had to be called off. It did not take place during the world wars, or during the epidemics of the 19th century.</p>
<p>For the past month, a tent has been set up on the fairgrounds, not to serve beer, but to test people for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Also the city of Pamplona announced the cancellation of one of Spain’s most famous festivals, the running of the bulls, on Tuesday because of the coronavirus threat. The country has been especially hard hit by the outbreak; it is currently the European nation with the largest number of confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Ana Elizalde, the acting mayor of Pamplona, said in a televised news conference that it was impossible to make “an exception” for the weeklong festival, scheduled to start on July 6, amid a long list of other major events that have been called off in Spain.</p>
<p>Elizalde, who is filling in for the mayor who has been ill with the virus, said she expected the city’s residents to show creativity in order to celebrate as best as possible while “respecting sanitary rules.”</p>
