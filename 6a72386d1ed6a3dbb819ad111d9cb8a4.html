<h1>The 2020 NFL draft went fully virtual, and fans weren't thrilled</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NFL was forced to pivot from a crowded, lavish 2020 draft in Las Vegas to a virtual event where representatives of every team make picks from their homes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>It’s not the NFL’s fault that commissioner Roger Goodell was forced to perform the opening ceremony from his basement or that every interaction has just been slightly more awkward than it would otherwise be because of technological limitations.</p>
<p>Regardless, the early reviews of ESPN and the NFL Network’s presentation of this year’s draft were far from glowing.</p>
<p>Chargers safety Derwin James isn’t loving the proceedings either.</p>
<p>Some folks have had fun dissecting the setups of NFL coaches, like the Bengals’ Zac Taylor and the Cardinals’ Kilff Kingsbury.</p>
<p>As everyone else critiqued the virtual draft, all Texans defensive end J.J. Watt — brother of Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt and fullback Derek Watt — could think about was how his mother would have reacted to knowing her living room would be broadcast to the world.</p>
