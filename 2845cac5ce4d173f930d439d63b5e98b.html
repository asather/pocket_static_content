<h1>‘Disturbing’ events at Beaver County nursing home as COVID-19 deaths rise to 52</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The worst COVID-19 nursing home outbreak in Pennsylvania took a horrific turn in recent days, with 13 more residents’ deaths reported from Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County, bringing the total who have died to at least 52 residents, based on a Post-Gazette analysis of state data.</p>
<p>Those 52 deaths are among 244 positive cases out of the 460 residents who lived at Brighton Rehab when the outbreak there began in March — meaning more than half of the residents have tested positive, nearly one-quarter of those who tested positive died, and more than 10% of all residents have now died. In addition, 18 staff members have tested positive, the data show.</p>
<p>“Clearly there’s something disturbing happening at that facility,” Jack Manning, a Beaver County commissioner, said Tuesday. “It’s very sad.”</p>

<p>The number of deaths and cases is based on <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Archives.aspx" target="_blank">the state Department of Health’s daily updates</a>, which Tuesday showed that the number of deaths in nursing homes and personal care homes in Beaver County jumped from 39 to 52 overnight, while the number of residents who tested positive was 247.</p>
<p>Neither Comprehensive Healthcare — the owners of Brighton Rehab&nbsp;— nor the state Department of Health, or any other official would confirm that all those deaths and nearly all of the positive cases are at Brighton.</p>
<p>But the state data show that only three nursing homes in Beaver County have had at least one positive case. Two other nursing homes in Beaver County have publicly admitted that they have had cases.</p>
<p>Concordia at Villa St. Joseph in Baden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.concordialm.org/covid-19-updates" target="_blank">has said that one resident</a>&nbsp;and one staff member have tested positive.</p>
<p>And Rochester Manor in Rochester has said <a href="/%20https:/www.timesonline.com/news/20200408/rochester-manor-and-villa-resident-tests-positive-for-covid-19" target="_blank">one resident there tested positive</a> in early April.</p>
<p>That leaves only Brighton Rehab — the fourth-largest nursing home in the state with a maximum 589 beds — for the remaining cases and deaths, a fact that officials in the county have long assumed.</p>
<p>“I was just telling someone yesterday: ‘Villa St. Joseph had one staff member test positive. We had one resident. That leaves Brighton with the rest,’” said Kristin Goldstrom Oeder, executive director of Rochester Manor. “It’s very scary, very sad. But the math is the math is the math.”</p>
<p>While Brighton Rehab’s owners would not confirm the numbers, they did send out a statement Tuesday night that attempted to minimize the horrific spread of the disease by conflating the number of younger, healthier staff who have worked in the building with the 460 elderly residents.</p>
<p>“In the last two months, the number of staff and residents at Brighton is approximately a thousand people,” the statement from Comprehensive Healthcare’s spokeswoman Gabriella Oglietti, said, in part. “Approximately 75% of those people have seemingly been unaffected by Covid19. Of the 25% who were affected, a percentage have passed after being diagnosed.”</p>
<p>“It should be understood that some of these people passed from non-Covid related illnesses, or natural causes. Once a person is diagnosed, the death is mis-recorded as a Covid death, even when Covid played no role. Some residents who passed were on hospice care. Others passed due to Covid19, but might have been saved had they not had advanced directives prohibiting life-saving measures, and in some cases life-sustaining treatment. Conversely, there is a large group of residents who were diagnosed as Covid+, that have now seemingly fully recovered, and returned to baseline. The number who have recovered well exceeds fifty, and many more are on their way to recovery,” she added.</p>
<p>But family of some of those who died say the number of deaths and positive cases at Brighton Rehab is likely an undercount of the true impact of the disease, with many more likely infected but not tested, and some of them have died.</p>
<p>Patricia Mazzocca, whose mother Ala Mazzocca, 91, died at Brighton Rehab on April 13, said her mother was not tested before she died. Staff told her and her family that her mother died of respiratory distress, which was later listed as pneumonia on her death certificate.</p>
<p>“If you’re working on this vague announcement that everyone in the building is positive, then what do you think her real cause of death was? It’s obvious,” she said, referring to Brighton Rehab’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/06/Brighton-Rehab-and-Wellness-Beaver-PA-nursing-home-coronavirus-positive-cases/stories/202004060124?cid=search" target="_blank">declaration April 6 that it assumed everyone</a> in the building was positive for COVID-19. “They’re playing with the numbers.”</p>
<p>Despite their mother not being tested, the Mazzocca family listed <a href="https://www.timesonline.com/Beaver/OBITUARIES/20200415/ALA-MARIA-VENTRESCA-MAZZOCCA" target="_blank">her cause of death in her obituary </a>&nbsp;as “complications of coronavirus.”</p>
<p>“We’re just being truthful,” Patricia Mazzocca said of the obituary.</p>
<p>Two other families whose loved ones have died in the past two months at Brighton Rehab also said the cause of death was listed as pneumonia, not COVID-19 related.</p>
<p>Despite the horrific situation at Brighton Rehab, the state Department of Health said it has looked into what has happened there and not found any problems.</p>
<p>“The department does not believe that there were any serious red flags about the way Brighton has responded to the COVID-19 cases seen at the facility,” state spokesman Nate Wardle said in an email.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, who has been following the events at Brighton Rehab, does see problems that may be related to some of its recent poor performance history even before the pandemic that placed it on a list of the nation’s worst nursing homes that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/04/06/Bob-Casey-Pat-Toomey-pa-nursing-homes-brighton-rehabilitation-beaver-county-COVID-19/stories/202004060086?cid=search" target="_blank">Mr. Toomey and fellow U.S. Sen. Bob Casey pushed to release last year.</a></p>
<p>“The details of what is transpiring at Brighton’s facility in Beaver County are grim,” Mr. Toomey said in a statement Tuesday. “Many nursing homes face extreme challenges in controlling the spread of COVID-19 infection, but for those like Brighton, whose documented histories of poor performance would qualify them as a Special Focus Facility, heightened safeguards should have been implemented in the weeks leading up to the outbreak.”</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Toomey announced that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had agreed to his request to make testing residents and staff at nursing homes for COVID-19 a priority.</p>
<p>“Ensuring adequate testing capacity and rapid results are available for those who live and work in nursing homes will save lives and mitigate further spread,” Mr. Toomey said in a statement.</p>
<p>Though the state has so far not found any problems with Brighton Rehab’s response to the outbreak there, residents’ families are unlikely to agree with that.</p>
<p>The first sign of that occurred Tuesday as well, when <a href="https://www.timesonline.com/news/20200428/daughter-of-brighton-rehab-resident-sues-pa-department-of-health" target="_blank">one family filed a class-action lawsuit </a>against the state Department of Health alleging improprieties with Brighton Rehab’s use of a consent form to allow experimental COVID-19 treatments and the state’s failure to oversee the process.</p>
<p>Mr. Manning, the county commissioner, said that lawsuit is not likely the last accusation of improper handling of the outbreak by Brighton Rehab.</p>
<p>“I guarantee you, unfortunately, that when this is all done, there will be some serious issues to be dealt with at Brighton Rehab,” he said.</p>
