<h1>Jury for Wilkinsburg slaying remains at six people so far</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>No jurors were seated Thursday in the case against two men accused of killing five people and an unborn child at a Wilkinsburg cookout in 2016.</p>
<p>Twelve potential panelists were interviewed Thursday afternoon, but none were selected to sit on the capital case against Cheron Shelton, 32, of Lincoln-Lemington and Robert Thomas, 31, of Homewood, who face charges of criminal homicide, conspiracy and related counts, stemming from <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2016/03/10/Multiple-people-shot-in-Wilkinsburg/stories/201603100136" target="_blank">the March 9, 2016, shooting.</a></p>
<p>Jury selection in the case, to be heard by Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/06/wilkinsburg-mass-shooting-jury-selection-allegheny-county-cheron-shelton-robert-thomas/stories/202001060061" target="_blank">began on Monday</a>, when two jurors were chosen. Between Tuesday and Wednesday, four more people were selected.</p>
<p>The breakdown thus far includes three men and three women.</p>
<p>Testimony in the case is expected to begin the week of Feb. 3. The jurors will not be sequestered during the pendency of the trial.</p>
<p>Police said that Thomas used a handgun and Shelton used an assault-style rifle to herd the victims, who were enjoying an unseasonably warm evening, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2017/03/05/Nearly-a-year-later-Wilkinsburg-repairing-community-s-fabric-after-Franklin-Avenue-massacre/stories/201703050140" target="_blank">toward the back of the Franklin Avenue home</a>. A total of 49 shots were fired.</p>
<p>Killed were siblings Jerry Michael Shelton, 35, Brittany Powell, 27, and Chanetta Powell, 25, who was eight months pregnant; and their cousins Tina Shelton, 37, and Shada Mahone, 26. Three others were wounded including a man who was paralyzed.</p>
<p>If a jury finds the defendants guilty of first-degree murder, the case will move into a penalty phase during which the panel will have to decide between the death penalty or a mandatory prison term of life without parole.</p>
<p>Thus far, both the prosecution and defense have used four peremptory strikes each, in which they can eliminate a potential juror for any reason without explanation.</p>
<p>The prosecution has 16 strikes remaining, as do both defendants.</p>
