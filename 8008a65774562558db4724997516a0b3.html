<h1>Penguins defenseman Brian Dumoulin cherishing time at home, knowing it might soon end</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Penguins defenseman Brian Dumoulin lacerated tendons in his ankle Nov. 30, the injury came with more than just surgery and a three-month recovery.</p>
<p>There was also a silver lining.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old blue liner became a father just a few weeks earlier when his wife, Kayla, gave birth to their first child, Brayden. So instead of long road trips to Calgary, Phoenix and Detroit, Dumoulin spent some unexpected time at home. With the COVID-19 pandemic pausing the NHL season and forcing players to quarantine at home, that silver lining has been underscored even more.</p>
<p>“Obviously, I wish I could have played every game that I missed,” Dumoulin said Tuesday. “But in that time, I was able to spend a lot of time with Brayden and see him develop. He turned six months the other day. It was pretty cool to not miss much of his life so far — especially early on in his life, where a lot of his development happens, both mentally and developing trust in his parents. I’m very fortunate.”</p>
<p>Depending how and when the NHL decides to return, that might change dramatically.</p>
<p>While the NHL has yet to outline any specific plans for a return to play, one hypothetical scenario that’s gaining steam would be to have teams compete in a handful of “hub” cities. These neutral-site games would significantly reduce travel. The NHL might also limit the virus’ ability to penetrate a so-called “bubble” by sequestering players in hotel rooms, limiting contact with the outside world and testing regularly.</p>
<p>Dumoulin said it would be his “duty” to play if and when the league chooses to resume, even if it’s in an empty arena.</p>
<p>“If we’re playing in my driveway, that’d be fine with me if we’re playing for the Stanley Cup,” he said.</p>
<p>But some other players in the league don’t necessarily share that same opinion. Some are less than thrilled about the idea of spending a significant amount of time away from their loved ones, especially during an uncertain time when their families might need their support.</p>
<p>“Some players could be away from their families for three to four months and I think that’s way too much,” Canadiens forward Philip Danault told Montreal media members. “I’m not the only one thinking like that, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in a radio interview with 630 CHED in Edmonton that he understands this concern from players.</p>
<p>“We don’t intend them to be isolated and away from their families for a two-, three- or four-month period of time,” Daly said. “We understand the importance of family interaction. We’ll find a way to accommodate that.”</p>
<p>That might be easier said than done.</p>
<p>Sure, players could theoretically bring their families. But there are about 700 NHL players. If each one brought, say, a wife and a kid like Dumoulin, that would increase the scale of this bubble exponentially.</p>
<p>What about someone like Patrick Marleau, who has four sons? Or how about Nick Bjugstad, who has one kid and a wife who is pregnant who may need to visit a doctor regularly?</p>
<p>Those 700 players could quickly turn into 3,000 or more people. At some point, what was supposed to be a small bubble becomes a large community.</p>
<p>Each additional person means the NHL would need more tests. And every time someone else joins the bubble, the statistical probability of infection increases.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the NHL can find a safe solution to satisfy both sides. For now, Dumoulin said the pandemic has encouraged him to stay in the moment and enjoy the extra time at home.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m not taking anything for granted with my family,” Dumoulin said. “I’m enjoying every moment of it. Obviously, if that’s what the NHL decides and what we decide, that’s what we do. We go there. We focus on winning a Stanley Cup and that’s our goal.”</p>
