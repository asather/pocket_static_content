<h1>Size aside, Vincent Davis carrying Pitt's ground game so far</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Matt DuBuc, the head football coach at Cardinal Gibbons High School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., chatted with Pitt assistant and area recruiter Charlie Partridge on Tuesday night. The coaches discussed a current prospect or two, as well as Marquis Williams’ interception against Louisville. Williams is one of two Cardinal Gibbons players on Pitt’s roster.</p>
<p>The other is Pitt’s primary rusher, a 5-foot-8, 175-pounder who’s shown through three games that he can put the weight of the Panthers’ running game on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Vincent Davis doesn’t have the frame you’d normally associate with a bell-cow back. But with 42 carries so far this year, third-most in the ACC, the sophomore is holding up just fine — making guys miss and even doling out some hits himself as he tries to cement his spot atop Pitt’s depth chart.</p>
<p>“Vince is one of the toughest guys on the team. He prides himself on that,” Pitt captain and quarterback Kenny Pickett said after Davis’ 18-touch, 76-yard game against Louisville. “He’s a smaller guy, but it takes two or three to bring him down. He’s a guy I love playing with, a guy who plays full tilt.”</p>
<p>“We always knew him as a game-breaker,” DuBuc said. “He runs like he’s a fullback but can change direction like a 150-pound back. He’s just an explosive guy.”</p>
<p>Though the coaching staff would like to see more on the ground — blocking for 8 yards and getting 28, as Pat Narduzzi said earlier in the season — Davis has provided that pop to an aspect of Pitt’s offense that was severely lacking last year.</p>
<p>Anyone who watched Pitt in 2019 knows how non-existent the running game was. The Panthers ranked 100th nationally in rushing attempts and 118th in rushing yards per game. Perhaps more telling, Pitt had only nine rushing plays of 20-plus yards. The only Football Bowl Subdivision team that played 13 games and had fewer was Washington State.</p>
<p>It appeared early on this season that Pitt might lack that explosion again. After all, Pickett and wide receiver Jordan Addison accounted for the Panthers’ longest rushes in the opener against Austin Peay.</p>
<p>But Davis eased those concerns a bit on the first snap against Louisville, bursting through the Cardinals’ front for a 20-yard gain, the Panthers’ first such run of the young season. He did it again in the third quarter, breaking off a 21-yard run. And in the fourth, he made three men miss en route to a 14-yard gain.</p>

<p>Any hype around those runs could be tempered by looking up Louisville’s rush defense statistics. The Cardinals had a bad defense in 2019, flat out, and they were especially bad against the run (112th nationally in yards allowed per game). But Syracuse’s rush defense was bad last year, too, and Pitt didn’t do much in Week 2.</p>
<p>So the Panthers will take their victories where they can. And one of them has clearly been the play of Davis, who’s also chipped in seven catches for 64 yards this year.</p>
<p>“He’s playing with a lot of confidence,” Narduzzi said. “He’s a spin runner, and he’s not easy to take down.”</p>
<p>A former three-star prospect, Davis contributed as a true freshman, leading Pitt’s running backs with 5.15 yards per carry and tallying 314 yards — all while missing time due to a broken forearm. He showed flashes of speed, like his Wildcat touchdown runs of 61 and 39 yards against Georgia Tech and Boston College, respectively. But he was still stuck in a committee, and that was expected to be the case again this season.</p>
<p>Pitt entered the 2020 campaign with what looked like a five-man backfield, featuring Vincent Davis, veterans A.J. Davis and Todd Sibley, redshirt freshman Daniel Carter and true freshman Israel “Izzy” Abanikanda. Through three games, though, Carter hasn’t received much work, and Sibley’s been mostly utilized on special teams.</p>
<p>A.J. Davis, Pitt’s second-leading ball-carrier this year, also picked up an injury against Louisville. No update has been provided on his status for this weekend’s game against N.C. State, but Pitt running backs coach Andre Powell said he’s “making good progress.”</p>
<p>In the absence of A.J. Davis and even before he went out, Abanikanda offered <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/03/06/Israel-Abanikanda-pitt-football-spring-practice-2020/stories/202003060137" target="_blank">a glimpse of what could come</a>. The Brooklyn native rushed for 41 yards on nine carries against Louisville after finding the end zone in the Austin Peay game. While pass-blocking is normally an issue for freshman tailbacks, Powell said he will give Abanikanda more playing time going forward.</p>
<p>That could cut into Vincent Davis’ carries. But the two bring different styles to the running back room, and Davis does have a leg up in terms of experience.</p>
<p>The one constant when asking Narduzzi, Pickett and Powell about Davis was the player’s maturity.</p>
<p>Pickett said the “jump” Davis has made from 2019 to 2020 has to do with his preparation and willingness to step up and speak in the running back room. Powell added that, ability aside, Davis’ leadership traits at Cardinal Gibbons stood out to him, as the school won a state championship behind Davis’ standout senior season.</p>
<p>Davis brought those qualities from Florida to the South Side, too.</p>
<p>“I have to tell him every day, ‘Vince, you do not coach Izzy. I coach Izzy.’ Because he’s always coaching him,” Powell said, shaking his head. “I come in my office and he’s got the other guys in my office watching video. I can’t even get in my office half the time because he’s in there watching tape with other guys. So he’s got a lot of really good qualities. He’s going to continue to get better as it goes.”</p>
<p>DuBuc wasn’t surprised when he heard that. The Cardinal Gibbons coach, who watched Davis score 13 touchdowns as a senior, recalled being happy to see the back choose Pitt and learn from Powell. DuBuc said it was a “match made in heaven,” that Powell’s no-frills attitude and focus on execution would be good for Davis.</p>
<p>It’s seemed to pay off so far.</p>
<p>“He’ll continue to develop,” DuBuc said. “Pro prospect wise, obviously if he puts on some more size, there’s a niche for those guys in the league right now. And that’s a true possibility.”</p>
<p>Perhaps Davis will take another small step toward that future this weekend against N.C. State.</p>
