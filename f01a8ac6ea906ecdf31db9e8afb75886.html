<h1>Sue Paterno, Franco Harris go on Penn State fan cruise despite COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Some people just can’t get enough of that cruise ship life, health concerns be damned.</p>
<p>Despite the Center for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/covid-19-cruise-ship" target="_blank">recently recommending</a> that “travelers, particularly those with underlying health issues, defer all cruise ship travel worldwide” amid the COVID-19 outbreak, a Penn State fan cruise <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/penn-state-fan-cruise-sets-sail-despite-coronavirus-spread-with-sue-paterno-franco-harris-on-board.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=pennlive_sf&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank">recently set sail</a> featuring 171 fans and alumni, according to PennLive.</p>
<p>The Celebrity Infinity cruise ship departed with this Penn State group from Port of Miami and is scheduled to make stops in Key West, Fla., and Cozumel, Mexico. The Nittany Lions on board will spend five nights at sea for this charity event which benefits the Special Olympics.</p>
<p>It’s strange enough that this ship was allowed to leave in the middle of this COVID-19 pandemic, especially considering how <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2020/03/12/Princess-Cruises-suspends-cruise-ship-operations-60-days-Viking-cancellations/stories/202003120192" target="_blank">other recent cruises</a> have served as breeding grounds for the virus. What makes it even more remarkable is that among the Penn State group on the ship is Franco Harris, legendary Steelers running back and Penn State alum, and Sue Paterno, matriarch of the Paterno family.</p>
<p>Also on board is Lydell Mitchell, a former Penn State running back who played in the NFL from 1972-80 for the Baltimore Colts, San Diego Chargers and Los Angeles Rams.</p>
<p>Harris and Mitchell are both 70 years old, while Paterno is 80. “Older adults” and “people who have serious chronic medical conditions” are the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html" target="_blank">most susceptible population</a> when it comes to folks most likely to contract COVID-19, according to CDC guidelines.</p>
<p>Tom Peeling, a former Palm Beach Post editor who has been on this cruise all week, told PennLive that “crew members are in front of the main dining hall entrances with large bags of sanitizer encouraging everyone to use it.” One crew member, according to Peeling, even created a theme song for the trip: “The more you sanitize, the happier you will be, while at sea, on Celebrity.”</p>
<p>Paterno told PennLive that most people on the cruise are refraining from hugs, hand shakes and other common forms of social greetings.</p>
<p>“Everybody’s doing the elbows,” she said.</p>
<p>If you’re still wondering why, even with these precautions, all these Nittany Lions would go on this cruise given the current climate, it may have to do with the outlook of Eileen Miner, the group’s travel agent, in regards to COVID-19. She told PennLive that she believes the panic over the virus’ spread has been “blown out of proportion.”</p>
<p>“It’s OK to warn us. It’s a serious thing,” she said. “But to tell us to stop living is wrong."</p>
<p>Hopefully everyone on board the cruise has fun, celebrates the alma mater and, above all, stays safe and healthy.</p>
