<h1>Port Authority reports few problems with new senior ConnectCards</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority officials say the beginning-of-the-year requirement for <a href="https://www.portauthority.org/fares-and-passes/discounted-fares/" target="_blank">seniors to have photo ConnectCards</a> for free rides hasn’t created any operational delays.</p>
<p>As a result of a change in state regulations, transit riders 65 and older can no longer use their Medicare card for a free ride on the bus or light rail system. Instead, they must use a new, free ConnectCard with their photo on it to prevent fraud from riders inappropriately sharing their Medicare card with someone under 65.</p>
<p>“I’ve not heard&nbsp;— or at least it hasn’t been passed on to the divisional leaders at our garages&nbsp;— that there have been any widespread issues,” said authority spokesman Adam Brandolph.&nbsp;“We heard very little as far as seniors who continue to try to use their Medicare card.”</p>
<p>For the first few days, Mr. Brandolph said, drivers allowed seniors to use the Medicare card but reminded them that they needed to get the new photo card. Seniors who have the state-issued transit cards&nbsp;— yellow for women or blue for men — can continue to use those cards, but Port Authority is encouraging them to get the photo ConnectCards.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said it appears seniors were aware of the change because just over 27,000 had them by the middle of December. Still, another 1,412 applied for cards last week, 670 at the authority’s Smithfield Street service center and the rest at the offices of state senators and representatives who take photos and applications and send them to the authority.</p>
<p>“People are definitely aware,” Mr. Brandolph said.&nbsp;“There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t pass at least one person Downtown with their card hanging from a lanyard.”</p>
<p>The authority will continue its efforts to make sure that every senior who needs a photo ConnectCard gets one, including those who are approaching their 65th birthday. It will buy mailing lists that contain birth dates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In mid-February, the agency will send a postcard to every area resident who is 65 to remind them about the new requirement. Those who already have the card will be removed from the list.</p>
<p>Additionally, it will mail a different postcard to residents within two weeks of their birthday to remind them to get the new card if they expect to ride public transit for free.</p>
<p>Seniors can receive free photo ConnectCards over the counter from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays at the authority’s Downtown Service Center, 623 Smithfield St.</p>
<p>They also can apply for cards at the offices of most state legislators in Allegheny County, but seniors should check with the office for hours and whether they provide the service. The offices send the applications and photos to the authority for processing, then seniors can get the new card at the legislator’s office when it is ready.</p>
