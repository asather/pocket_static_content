<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The city’s Public Works Department has moved employees to assist in trash and recycling collection in part because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Approximately 20 parks maintenance employees were shifted last week to sanitation work&nbsp;“to help with staffing due to Environmental Services workers who need to call off for various reasons, including but not limited to self-isolation,” said Timothy McNulty, mayoral spokesman.</p>
<p>The mayor’s office announced Wednesday that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/15/First-pittsburgh-environmental-services-worker-dies-of-COVID-19/stories/202004150093" target="_blank">one of the bureau’s truck drivers died</a> from complications of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city had announced last week that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/09/pittsburgh-police-covid-19-coronavirus-more-officers-test-positive/stories/202004090137" target="_blank">two sanitation workers tested positive for COVID-19</a> and that a&nbsp;“small group&nbsp;of coworkers who came into contact with them are in self-isolation as a precaution,” according to Mr. McNulty.</p>
<p>The number of employees in self-isolation is 13, according to the Teamsters&nbsp; Local 249,&nbsp;which represents the city’s sanitation workers.</p>
<p>“There is some rubbish left on the street,” said Paul Kapetanovich, of Local 249.</p>
<p>The reassignment of some Public Works employees is “just a temporary thing until our numbers get back up,” he said.</p>
<p>The city employed 209 environmental services workers at the end of 2019, according to city employment records.</p>
