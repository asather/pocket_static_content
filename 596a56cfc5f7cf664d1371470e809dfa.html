<h1>Second-round pick Jared Jones finds perfect fit with Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jimmy Zurn couldn’t believe his eyes.</p>
<p>Despite watching plenty of “electric” pitching performances from Jared Jones over the past four years, the La Mirada (Calif.) High School baseball coach could only shake his head in amazement when Jones was suddenly sporting a Pirates jersey last week a few minutes after they drafted him in the second round (44th overall).</p>
<p>“He comes out, and he’s in a Pirates jersey,” Zurn recalled by phone late Monday, talking about the draft party Jones had at his house. “I’m like, ‘What are the chances?’ ”</p>
<p>The jersey featured Cole Tucker’s name and number because Jones knows Cole’s younger brother Carson, but it was also sort of emblematic of Jones’ Pirates career thus far: fast-moving and a perfect fit.</p>
<p>Less than a week after the MLB draft, Jones has already agreed to terms with the Pirates, likely forgoing his commitment to the University of Texas assuming his physical (the only remaining hurdle) checks out.</p>
<p>Similar to Josh Bell, another Texas recruit who chose the Pirates over the Longhorns, it’s likely that Jones received some financial motivation to pass on college and start his professional career.</p>
<p>“You guys got an absolutely special, special kid,” Zurn gushed. “He’s ready to go.”</p>
<p>It certainly seems like the perfect fit for both sides.</p>
<p>Jones was a two-way star at La Mirada but an especially dominant pitcher. Zurn said Jones’ fastball sat in the mid-90s and touched 99 mph.</p>
<p>Whereas many high schoolers have two pitches and hope for a third, Jones potentially has four very good ones: a fastball, a swing-and-miss slider, a changeup (that needs some work) and a curveball that has been an incredible, recent addition.</p>
<p>So recent, in fact, that Jones has spent much of this quarantine time on the pitch, which boasts a spin rate of 2,659 rpm, according to Trackman numbers publicized by California Prep Baseball Report — a scouting service.</p>
<p>(For context, the spin rate on Joe Musgrove’s curveball in 2019 was 2,575 rpm.)</p>
<p>“He starts throwing that curveball in 2-1 counts where they’re sitting on a fastball,” Zurn said, “and it’s a game-changer.”</p>
<p>Jones has also been working at the changeup quite a bit, Zurn said, experimenting with different grips and pressure. Right now it averages around 90-91 mph, which likely must go down to create enough separation.</p>
<p>While his slider (spin rate: 2,707 rpm) is unquestionably elite, Jones’ arm strength might be the biggest thing that separates him.</p>
<p>Especially because he’s still only 18.</p>
<p>“He’s just got that natural kind of whip and athleticism to where, it’s almost like scary in a good way,” Zurn said. “He’s still 18. He’s still going to grow into his body. Where can that go?”</p>
<p>Potentially to two positions, although the Pirates have given no indication they want their own version of Shohei Ohtani or Michael Lorenzen.</p>
<p>There could be reason to consider such a role with Jones, who hit .457 as a junior. A four-year starter, Jones was named the 2019 Perfect Game/Rawlings National High School Two-Way Player of the Year.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing he can’t do in my opinion,” Zurn said of Jones potentially becoming a two-way guy.&nbsp;“It wouldn’t shock me, especially with what Lorenzen is doing with the Reds.”</p>
<p>Lorenzen is a key name to know because he and Jones have apparently struck up a relationship through La Mirada’s Fellowship for Christian Athletes program and various FCA camps Lorenzen has worked.</p>
<p>Zurn said Jones has already spoken to Lorenzen about the challenges of playing multiple positions.</p>
<p>“Jared and Michael have built a connection to where Jared can reach out to him,” Zurn said.</p>
<p>Jones was strictly a baseball player at La Mirada, but Zurn said he routinely watched his stud pitcher thrive in other sports.</p>
<p>During the fall, Zurn would hold what he described as an olympic-style competition every Friday for fun. Volleyball and ultimate frisbee were just two of the games they’d play.</p>
<p>The winning team at the end of the season received lunch on the coach.</p>
<p>“I don’t care if it’s throwing the football or punting,” Zurn said. “He’s one of those athletes who’s going to be good at whatever he does.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Jones finished his high school career with a 20-6 record, a 0.89 ERA and a .150 batting average against. As a junior, Jones went 7-1 with a 0.77 ERA and 94 strikeouts in 64 innings. He fanned 28 in 17 innings as a senior before the season was shut down.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The knock against Jones has been “a command slide” last summer that, Zurn explained, was perfectly understandable for a high school kid.&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-mark="1">Turns out that Jones’ mom unexpectedly passed away, while his grandmother — with whom he’s extremely close — had been battling cancer.</span></p>
<p>“He’s going to be fine,” Zurn said. “His grandma is in remission — thank God. She’s in a good place, but I know that has been on his mind.”</p>
<p>The ability to compartmentalize those things and continue to perform at a high level should impress the Pirates. Ditto for Jones’ immense physical tools and versatility.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">All are reasons there may soon be more comparisons made to Bell.</span></p>
<p>“He’s one of those once-in-a-lifetime kids,” Zurn said. “I’m excited for him. I’m excited for the Pirates, too. He’s just a winner.”</p>
