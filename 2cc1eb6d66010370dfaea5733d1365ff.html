<h1>Pitchers Mitch Keller, Michael Feliz injured in Pirates' loss to Cubs</h1>

<p>CHICAGO — The Pirates arrived at Wrigley Field on Saturday clinging to hope that their <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/08/01/pittsburgh-pirates-chicago-cubs-colin-moran-josh-bell-trevor-williams/stories/202008010029" target="_blank">offensive outburst in the ninth inning</a> the night before might translate into something substantive.</p>
<p>While a contagion did emerge, it was hardly the one they wanted.</p>
<p>Instead of their bats staying hot, the Pirates’ weird propensity for pitching injuries took over, as two of their impact arms, including Mitch Keller, left a 4-3 loss that guaranteed Pittsburgh a third consecutive series loss.</p>
<p>Keller exited the game with two outs in the bottom of the third inning after delivering a curveball in the dirt to Cubs catcher Willson Contreras, the team terming the issue left-side discomfort. Michael Feliz left in the eighth with right forearm discomfort, another blow to the Pirates beleaguered bullpen.</p>
<p>“They’re still being evaluated right now,” manager Derek Shelton said. “So I think we’ll probably have more information [Sunday]. As these things happen, the first night, we have to make sure they get evaluated.”</p>
<p>Although he didn’t wince in pain or anything like that, Keller did immediately motion to the dugout that something was wrong. Head athletic trainer Bryan Housand came out to the mound and was soon joined by Shelton before Keller was removed from the game.</p>
<p>While Shelton cautioned against speculating on either pitcher, he did say that Keller’s discomfort started Saturday; it wasn’t something that lingered last Sunday in St. Louis as Keller’s velocity lagged some in his season debut.</p>
<p>After facing three batters in the eighth — and retiring none of them — Feliz made his abrupt exit. Jacob Stallings actually first alerted everyone that something did not look right.</p>
<p>The arm issue is yet another dent to a Pirates bullpen that’s already missing Keone Kela (COVID-19), Kyle Crick (right shoulder/lat) and Edgar Santana (PED suspension). If they lose Feliz, their only two guys left with late-inning experience are Nick Burdi and Richard Rodriguez.</p>
<p>In a season where the Pirates are already without Jameson Taillon and Chris Archer — in addition to suffering from sporadic offense — an injury to Keller hurts even more.</p>
<p>Not to get too ahead of ourselves because we don’t know the scope of anything here, but this was supposed to be a learning year for Keller, a chance to get his feet wet and develop.</p>
<p>In a 60-game season, even if Keller recovers quickly, it’s still a pretty big speed bump; he and the Pirates would obviously rather worry about first-pitch strikes, refining his changeup and burying his breaking stuff.</p>
<p>The injury does potentially open a door for 2015 sixth-round pick JT Brubaker, who made his MLB debut last Sunday in St. Louis and looked terrific, striking out four over two shutout innings. However, Brubaker had not pitched since.</p>
<p>Was he hurt? Are the Pirates nuts? Something else? It’s mostly the third option, although the Pirates are trying to be careful with Brubaker, who has electric stuff.</p>
<p>The caution was due in large part to Brubaker’s injury history, as he was limited to just four starts with Class AAA Indianapolis in 2019 because of a right forearm strain. To his credit, the Pirates minor league pitcher of the year in 2018 has looked terrific in spring training dating back to February.</p>
<p>Brubaker comported himself well against the Cubs on Saturday, tossing three scoreless innings while allowing one hit, one walk and striking out three.</p>
<p>“I think I did pretty well,” Brubaker said. “Got myself into a little bit of a jam, just trying to throw swing-and-miss pitches instead of contact pitches. I think that’s the only thing I can look back on is make sure I go right after guys and not try to do too much.”</p>
<p>The other component is the fact that Brubaker has always been a starter, and it’s probably where he fits best with the Pirates (2-6). But until Saturday, there simply wasn’t a spot for him. There could be now, depending on what happens with Keller.</p>
<p>“We talk a lot about getting better and doing things,” Shelton said, “and [Brubaker] got better [Saturday].”</p>
<p>It was not a particularly strong start from Keller, even before the injury. He danced between raindrops in the first two innings before Cubs outfielder Ian Happ (Mt. Lebanon) and shortstop Javier Baez went deep.</p>
<p>Happ jumped on a hanging curveball from Keller. The four-seamer Baez whacked was a little better, but it hardly mattered. Baez crushed it 448 feet to center field, the fourth-longest home run for any MLB hitter so far in 2020.</p>
<p>Although it might be irrelevant at this point, one small bit of good news involved Keller’s velocity, which was a few miles per hour below normal in his last start — 92.0 compared to an average of 95.4 in 2019. On Saturday, Keller’s fastball averaged 93.5 mph.</p>
<p>Offensively, this one actually mirrored what the Pirates did Friday, especially against Cubs starter Tyler Chatwood, who matched his career high with 11 strikeouts and made short work of the Pirates by relying on a sinker-cutter combination that he used for 70 of 96 pitches.</p>
<p>The Pirates entered the game hitting an MLB-low .177 with five guys at .118 or below. They looked every bit of that against Chatwood, the right-hander giving the Cubs 6⅔ innings of scoreless ball.</p>
<p>But after Feliz gave up a two-run homer to Cubs left fielder Kyle Schwarber in the eighth inning, the Pirates once again rallied. Colin Moran’s MLB-best fifth home run of the season brought the Pirates to within two runs at 4-2.</p>
<p>The Pirates cut it to one when Bryan Reynolds followed with a double, reached third via defensive indifference and scored on Gregory Polanco’s groundout to shortstop. But at that point, the Cubs (6-2) finally shut the door.</p>
<p>“We have very talented hitters,” Moran said. “I know it’s the beginning of the season, so everything feels like it’s amplified. We have very talented hitters, and all it takes is a game like [Kevin] Newman and Reynolds had [Saturday], a game where they just feel some barrels and get their timing, like Polanco [Friday] night. It just takes some timing, and then you click and you roll with it.</p>
<p>“So yeah, I’m very confident in our hitters.”</p>
<p>Now, the Pirates must hope that confidence extends to a pair of important pitchers.</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>Newman’s seventh-inning single snapped an 0-for-20 funk, while Reynolds’ single that same inning halted an 0-for-10 skid. … In three career starts against the Cubs, Keller has now allowed 19 hits over 12 innings, including eight doubles and four home runs.</p>
