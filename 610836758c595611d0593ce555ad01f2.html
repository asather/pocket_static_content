<h1>Having trouble with the IRS site? Try all caps.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Getting a “payment status not available” error when you’re trying to learn the status of your Internal Revenue Service coronavirus stimulus check? Try this one weird trick that really works: Enter your street address in all caps.</p>
<p>Yes, really. The IRS website had a big update this week, so it’s possible the site only just ported over your information and will let you log in now without having to shout at it. You’re welcome to try typing out your street address the normal way. But if that doesn’t work, don’t despair: Many people have found that entering their street address in all capital letters was the key to getting in and being able to enter their bank account information in order to have their stimulus funds deposited electronically instead of waiting for a check in the mail.</p>
<p>There is a technological reason for this involving knowledge of arcane programming and the federal government’s aversion to investing in resolving its tech debt. But the “why” doesn’t matter quite so much as the “whoa” here, which is: Whoa, this works?</p>

<p>Some people spoke on social media of feeling a little upset about needing a life hack to get the IRS tool to work.</p>
<p>Others made wry comments underpinned by how the IRS has long relied on outdated computer systems.</p>
<p>In any case, if you’re struggling to log in and enter your bank account information, it’s worth trying again in all caps. If that works for you, you can sit back and look forward to receiving a letter prominently signed by the president about it.</p>
<p>Under the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or Cares Act, passed last month, the Treasury will eventually send out 150 million stimulus payments to eligible Americans.</p>
<p>If you’re still waiting on your stimulus money, here is an estimate of when more payments will be delivered.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Social Security, survivor and disability non-filers will see economic impact payments in their bank accounts by April 29, according to a Treasury spokeswoman.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;SSI non-filers should begin seeing payments in early May.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Veterans benefit recipients should also begin receiving their stimulus payments by early May, a Treasury spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;In an update posted Sunday, the IRS said that if you have successfully entered your bank information “any day until noon on Tuesday, your payment date will be available beginning the following Saturday.” If you miss the Tuesday deadline, you have to wait another week to get a payment date. Or, if your payment has already been processed, you’ll get a check that could take up to 14 days to receive.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;If you receive SSI or Veterans Affairs benefits and didn’t file a tax return for 2018 or 2019, you have until May 5 to use the non-filer tool on the IRS website to receive the $500 payment per dependent child under 17. If you miss the deadline to register dependent children, you will still get your $1,200 payment, but you will have to wait until next year to get the additional $500 when you file a 2020 tax return.</p>
