<p>Pennsylvania State Police are searching for a black Hyundai that was stolen from an area in the eastern part of the state where a Connecticut homicide suspect was last seen.</p>
<p>State police said armed fugitive Peter Manfredonia, 23, a University of Connecticut senior,&nbsp;was last seen on video surveillance Sunday in East Stroudsburg, Pa., wearing a white T-shirt and dark shorts and carrying a large duffel bag near train tracks, police said.</p>
<p>Mr. Manfredonia&nbsp;is wanted in the machete killing of a 62-year-old man in Willington, Conn., and his own high school friend about 70 miles away in Derby, Conn., last weekend.&nbsp;A manhunt involving the FBI and multiple police agencies has been underway since Friday.</p>
<p>Trooper Anthony Petroski, of the&nbsp;Pennsylvania State Police&nbsp;Hazleton barracks, said Wednesday that Stroud Area Regional Police in East Stroudsburg issued an alert for a 2012 black Hyundai Santa Fe with Pennsylvania license plate KYW-1650.&nbsp;Trooper Petroski said it was stolen around 9 p.m. Monday.</p>
<p>He said anyone spotting Mr. Manfredonia should call 911 immediately.</p>
<p>Police said the suspect is armed with several stolen guns.</p>
<p>“It is not confirmed that he stole [the vehicle], but it was taken from the area where he was last seen,” Trooper Petroski said.</p>
<p>After the slayings, police said, Mr. Manfredonia fled Connecticut in a vehicle after forcing the owner, a 23-year-old woman, inside the car.&nbsp;The woman was located unharmed Sunday at a rest stop near Paterson, N.J., with her 2016 Volkswagen Jetta, police said.</p>
<p>Mr. Manfredonia then took an Uber to a Walmart in East Stroudsburg, not far from the New Jersey border, Pennsylvania State Police said.</p>
<p>A lawyer for Mr. Manfredonia’s family, Mike Dolan, said on Tuesday that the suspect has struggled with mental health issues and has “sought the help of a number of therapists.” His parents pleaded with their son to surrender to authorities.</p>
