<h1>Primary 2020 update: Allegheny County voters can expect mail-in ballots by Friday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Voters who applied for a mail-in ballot in Allegheny County right before Tuesday's deadline should expect to receive theirs by Friday, Elections Division Manager David Voye said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The county is mailing the last batch of ballots today, and kept the mail room open late on Tuesday to handle most of the 5,000 or so applications they received in the hours before the application deadline.</p>
<p>Mr. Voye said the division processed more than 280,000 applications overall for the June 2 primary and have gotten back about 86,000 voted ballots.</p>
<p>For voters who want to ensure their voted ballot makes it to the office before the time polls close on Election Day, the county is opening the lobby of its office building -- 542 Forbes Ave. in Downtown Pittsburgh -- as a ballot drop-off spot after normal business hours from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Monday and 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.</p>
<p>Voters can also drop their ballots off daily in the elections office between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. this week, as well as 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday and 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.</p>
<p>Mr. Voye said turnout from mail-in and absentee ballots alone could be more than 36 percent or 38 percent, which would near the total turnout for contested presidential primaries in 2016 and 2008. The uncontested presidential primary in 2012 garnered about 22 percent turnout, Mr. Voye said.</p>
