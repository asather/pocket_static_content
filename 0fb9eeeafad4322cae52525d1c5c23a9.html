<h1>Attorney: Kindergarten student burned during 'science project' at North Side school</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A 5-year-old girl was burned Tuesday during a class science project at Pittsburgh King PreK-8 on the North Side, according to the family’s attorney.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attorney Todd Hollis said in a phone interview Thursday that the family of the kindergarten student was still waiting to receive information about the incident from the Pittsburgh Public Schools.</p>
<p>“I believe the school district has a responsibility,” he said.&nbsp;“I don’t believe the details of that teacher’s plans in this matter are difficult to ascertain.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hollis declined to say if the family planned to sue the school district, but he acknowledged that “everything is being considered at this point.”</p>
<p>The girl suffered “significant burns to her body as a result of some substance that she was given by her teacher,” Mr. Hollis said. He said he did not know what the substance was, but the girl indicated that it happened during a “science project.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hollis said the school principal called the girl’s parents after the incident occurred and informed them that they had to pick up their daughter because she had been burned. He said the girl was eventually taken via EMS to a hospital, where she was treated and released, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools spokeswoman Ebony Pugh said in an email that the girl’s teacher was placed on&nbsp;paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the incident.</p>
<p>“As this is a personnel matter no further information is available,” she said.</p>
<p>Most of the information the family has received about the incident came from the girl, Mr. Hollis said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The young lady is very articulate,” he said,&nbsp;“and she was very clear in communicating with her family as to how this took place.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said he believed that the school district had an obligation to provide the parents with more information about what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The girl has&nbsp;“severe trauma” and will likely have lasing injuries from the incident, Mr. Hollis said.</p>
<p>“The child is reluctant to go back to school and doesn’t want to participate in any more science projects,” he said.</p>
