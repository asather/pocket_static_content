<h1>Gov. Wolf says Democrats 'can't afford' to let Trump win Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Unlike many of his Democratic counterparts across the country, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf hasn't made it a routine to publicly lambaste President Donald Trump over his administration's response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf wasn't as reserved on Monday morning, hopping onto a Zoom call with Pennsylvania's delegation to the Democratic National Convention and insisting that his party's presidential nominee, Joe Biden, will inherit a "mess" from Mr. Trump's presidency if he wins.</p>
<p>Democrats "can't afford to let" Mr. Trump win Pennsylvania this November, Mr. Wolf said, adding that "there is a real frustration among people who have to deal with the president in terms of [him] just not acting -- or acting in ways that are absolutely, well, downright nasty."</p>
<p>Republican and Democratic governors alike, Mr. Wolf claimed, need what Mr. Biden would bring to the COVID-19 response as president.</p>
<p>"We pine for leadership in the White House," Mr. Wolf said. "We're not getting it."</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said he's approaching this election with a "greater sense of urgency" than in 2016, when Mr. Trump carried Pennsylvania by about 44,000 votes.</p>
<p>"We have a chance in this election, I think, not only to get Democrats into office, but to re-establish our party as the party that actually is dedicated to making ordinary Pennsylvanians’ lives better," Mr. Wolf said.</p>
<p>Like other speakers said during the state party’s first virtual breakfast session, Mr. Wolf talked of the need to win down ballot races as well.</p>
<p>"We have a real shot to take back at least one of the chambers — if not both the chambers — of the general assembly," Mr. Wolf said of the state Legislature, adding that he's "working hard to make sure [state legislative candidates] have the ... financial support they need to get elected."</p>
<p>Speaking at Tuesday’s Pennsylvania breakfast will be the party’s entire state Congressional delegation.</p>
