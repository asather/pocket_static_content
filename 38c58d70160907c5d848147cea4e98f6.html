<h1>Pitt-Clemson observations: Horrid offensive and defensive showings, smart phones and a four-point swing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There were still 12 seconds remaining in the game Wednesday night as his walk-on point guard, KJ Marshall, dribbled out the clock, but Jeff Capel rose from his seat on the Pitt sideline, buttoned his suit jacket and walked to the scorers’ table to shake hands with the opposing coaching staff and team.</p>
<p>He had seen enough.</p>
<p>There was much to take away from his team’s 72-52 loss to Clemson at Petersen Events Center — little, if any, of it good. The Panthers were dominated, overmatched and outmaneuvered by a team that entered the matchup on a three-game losing streak, sporting an 11-12 overall record and a 1-6 mark in road games.</p>
<p>Among the evening’s most discouraging developments was an offense that, much like the team itself, looked flat, uninspired and generally lost. Clemson is one of the better defensive teams in the conference, ranking 31st of 353 teams nationally in defensive efficiency. Still, Pitt averaged 0.87 points per possession against the Tigers, the lowest mark they had allowed since a loss to Yale nearly two months ago.</p>
<p>There was no magical scheme or switch that befuddled the Panthers. They were bad against whatever it was they faced.</p>
<p>Clemson has, according to coach Brad Brownell, played man-to-man defense 85 to 90 percent of the time this season. It has occasionally turned to the zone, though, and after standout forward Aamir Simms checked out of the game about halfway through the first half, it began to utilize that scheme.</p>
<p>The Tigers finished the night playing zone and man almost evenly. On 26 possessions against the man, Pitt scored 21 points (0.81 points per possession). On 28 possessions against the zone, it got 20 points (0.71 points per possession).</p>
<p>“We kind of mix it sometimes when we think it can be helpful,” Brownell said of the zone. “Tonight, we felt like we wanted to use it a little bit and it was a effective for a while, so we stuck with it.”</p>
<p>For the Panthers, it was a step back in their efforts against the zone. In a win last Saturday against a Georgia Tech team employing a zone for much of the afternoon, they averaged 1.1 points per possession. A few days before that, against a Notre Dame team that also used zone for many possessions, they averaged 1.07 points per possession. In a Jan. 25 loss at Syracuse, college basketball’s quintessential zone team, they recovered from a slow start to score 40 points and shoot 53.6% from the field in the second half.</p>
<p>Clemson’s zone presented a different kind of obstacle, though. It was a two-three look, but in one of the zone’s traditional soft spots, the high post, it would have the defender anchoring the zone’s back line push up on an offensive player if he flashed to the free-throw line, which partially neutralized the effectiveness of a player like Justin Champagnie.</p>

<p>“We've never really seen that,” Champagnie said. “They wouldn't sit there. They wouldn't leave you in the middle. We haven't really seen that. But we've got to be better about getting the ball to the corner and looking at the baseline for the lobs.”</p>
<p>Capel said he anticipated seeing the zone from Clemson, especially given some of his team’s struggles against it, and Champagnie said they had prepared for it in practice.</p>
<p>The biggest difference wasn’t the zone’s implementation or wrinkles, but how Pitt operated against it. The Panthers were slow, inactive and hesitant, three of the things a team can least afford to be against such a defense.</p>
<p>“There was no movement,” Capel said. “When you catch the ball and you hold it and you’re thinking and trying to see, then the defense can load up. If you’re not moving, they’re not moving. They’re standing there, waiting. If you try to drive, which we’re a driving team, and there’s no movement, then there’s probably not anywhere to drive. We weren’t intelligent with some of the things we were doing early in this game. We have to fix it.”</p>
<p><strong>... and about that suddenly porous Pitt defense</strong></p>
<p>For all that beguiled it offensively, Pitt was worse on the defensive end.</p>
<p>One of the ACC’s worst statistical offenses averaged 1.2 points per possession against it and made 13 of its 22 3-pointers. In such a situation, blame can sometimes be hard to dispense. Was this a team that was riding a hot-hand and making contested shots? Or was it finding openings on the perimeter that it was regularly able to exploit?</p>
<p>In this instance, it’s more the latter. Of the Tigers’ 22 attempts from 3, 17 were open.</p>
<p>“These games, they don’t always have a lot of reason,” Brownell said. “It’s kind of a bad luck thing for Jeff and those guys because we shoot this well. We’ve had a lot of good shots in other games, but we don’t make any of them. We’ve had guys on other teams that shoot great against us and we watch them the next day and they can’t make a shot. Sometimes, there’s just no rhyme or reason for it. Sometimes, it’s just guys get in a good place and your team starts making a couple and it starts getting contagious.”</p>
<p>Though he finished the game with 12 points, the third-most on the team, Simms played a crucial role in creating some of those good looks. A versatile forward who is a strong ball-handler for a player his size (6-feet-9), Simms regularly drew double teams or, at the very least, attention from help defenders, whenever he would receive the ball on the low post. He was superb at passing it quickly out of those situations if he chose not to attack them directly, finding open teammates and catching Pitt on its heels.</p>

<p>Even if it just involved him standing with the ball at the top of the key, not even necessarily setting a hard screen, he was useful in freeing teammates, aided as they were at times by lazy, slow defense from Pitt players who were slow to close out on shooters.</p>

<p>It was just the latest sign of distress from what has been a devolving defense of late, one that has allowed its past seven opponents to average 1.08 points per possession.</p>
<p>“It was a combination of a lot of different things,” Capel said. “It was some breakdowns defensively, allowing middle penetration, which forces help, and them making shots there. When we tried to go zone, we tried to talk about keeping the ball out of the middle. They were able to get it there, which collapses the zone and gets it out to shooters. I think it was a combination of they made a lot of shots, obviously, but I do think a lot of it had to do with breakdowns in our defense. And they executed.”</p>
<p><strong>Phones and technology play a role in Pitt’s growth</strong></p>
<p>Capel spoke extensively after the game about his team needing to find consistency and maturity, part of which delved into a discussion about how they process a loss. In that predicament, Pitt’s coach sees a notable culprit — phones.</p>
<p>From Capel’s vantage point, many of his players are easily distracted by modern technology. He said it’s common, even after a loss, for 12 or 13 players on the team to be looking at their phones before leaving the locker room. It’s not just something he encounters; based on conversations he has had with other coaches, it is happening in locker rooms across the county. Benign as it may seem, Capel believes it has an effect.</p>
<p>“By the time they leave the locker room, their mind may be off the loss,” he said. “They may have gotten some texts. They may have looked at something on Twitter or Instagram. They’ve looked at some snaps. All of a sudden, your mind isn’t on ... like, this kills me. I won’t sleep tonight. I was that way when I was a player. I often wonder if I had all these distractions, would I have been that way? The game and the team has always been sacred to me. I don’t think I would have. We have to get to a point where this really bothers you.”</p>
<p><strong>Some swings are costlier than others</strong></p>
<p>It was only so consequential in a game Pitt was unlikely to win after it had fallen behind by as many as it had, but a potentially major shift came with about 6:30 remaining.</p>
<p>The Panthers were down by eight, 53-45, and had lucked into an offensive rebound after a missed shot against the Clemson zone. Forward Eric Hamilton collected the ball and had an open layup, only to leave the ball short. The Tigers made a jumper on the other end to push their lead to 10, a four-point swing that zapped whatever energy remained in the building.</p>

<p>Later in the game, Hamilton landed on the ball after dunking it and appeared to turn his ankle. He had to be helped off the court, unable to put much, if any, weight on his right ankle. Capel had no update on his injury status after the game.</p>
<p><strong>Numbers of note</strong></p>
<p><strong>807</strong>: Career points for Xavier Johnson, who scored eight against Clemson and became only the fourth player in Pitt history to surpass the 800-point mark as a sophomore.</p>
<p><strong>0</strong>: Shot attempts from guard Ryan Murphy, who played 16 minutes Wednesday after returning from a concussion that sidelined him for Pitt’s previous three games.</p>
<p><strong>71</strong>: Clemson’s combined margin of victory in its past four wins against Pitt. The only ACC programs against whom the Panthers have a worse point differential in their past four meetings are Virginia (minus-90) and Duke (minus-89)</p>
