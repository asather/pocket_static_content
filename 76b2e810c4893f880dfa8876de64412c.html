<h1>Police: Turnpike traffic stop yields 400 bricks of fentanyl and federal charges</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Philadelphia woman and a man from the Dominican Republic are in federal custody after state troopers pulled over their car on the Pennsylvania Turnpike on Wednesday and said they found 400 bricks of fentanyl.</p>
<p>Yarelis Mary Garcia Corretjer, 23, of Philadelphia and Reyelin Manuel Abreu Vasquez, 23, of the Dominican Republic are charged with possession with intent to distribute.</p>
<p>Police took the pair into custody on Wednesday evening and both appeared briefly in U.S. District Court on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to a complaint, two state troopers pulled over their Chevrolet Impala with New Jersey plates for speeding on the westbound Turnpike near Mount Pleasant. Ms. Garcia Corretjer was the driver.</p>
<p>Troopers said neither occupant could speak English very well so the troopers used Google Translate on their phones to communicate. Police said they noticed Ms. Garcia Corretjer was trembling and asked for consent to search the vehicle. They found a hidden compartment near the rear windshield that contained the fentanyl, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Troopers said both suspects gave evasive answers to questions. Ms. Garcia Corretjer said they were in Pittsburgh to visit her aunt, but Mr. Abreu Vasquez said they were visiting a friend, although he didn't know his name. Mr. Abreu Vasquez later told law officers that he was in the U.S. illegally and had crossed the Mexican border into the country four years ago.</p>
