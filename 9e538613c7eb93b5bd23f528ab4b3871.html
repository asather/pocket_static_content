<h1>Author Anne Enright on Irish readers and the art of performance </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Anne Enright attained international literary success when her novel,&nbsp;“The Gathering,” received the Man Booker Prize in 2007.</p>
<p>Her new novel, “Actress,” is partly inspired by her education at Trinity College in Dublin, where she was active in theater in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“I was a professional actress for two minutes,” Ms. Enright said in a telephone interview, adding that she loathed auditions.</p>
<p>While the Dublin native left the theater, the idea of writing about that world stayed with her. After reading about Valerie Solanas, who attempted to murder Andy Warhol in 1968, Ms. Enright created Katherine O’Dell, the protagonist of her new book.</p>
<p>Ms. Enright, 57, speaks at 7 p.m. Monday at Carnegie Library Lecture Hall in Oakland as part of Pittsburgh Arts &amp; Lectures.</p>
<p>The novel opens with Norah O’Dell, the practical daughter of actress Katherine O’Dell.&nbsp;Whether at home or on stage, the actress is always on. Norah watches her mother’s ups and downs carefully.&nbsp;The novel’s core truth is that women make survivors of themselves but cannot bear to see their daughters hurt.</p>
<p>In 2015, Ms. Enright was named the inaugural Laureate for Irish Fiction, which included a tour of her native Ireland and the world. The experience was instructive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Irish readership is this great resource. They follow everything. They read everything. Not like American readers, who are blogging.... You are guaranteed readers when you publish in Ireland,” she said.</p>
<p>Irish readers, Ms. Enright said, are conscious of their country’s literary tradition, including “the idea that you could go anywhere with the sentence.”</p>
<p>As a young reader, the author was influenced by Frank O’Connor, the famed Irish short story writer whose work inspired an award named for him and a literary festival in his native Cork.</p>
<p>“His grammatical tics, his run-on sentences, his inability to stop a sentence —&nbsp;he has to keep going with the sentence until it’s done. That is very much mimicked in my own work today.”</p>
<p>Another key influence was Flann O’Brien, an Irish novelist, playwright and satirist whose “curly-wurly sentences” inspired her. The author considers him “a kind of cool man’s Joyce. He is just legend.”</p>
