<h1>Region’s grocery stores set limits on some meat sales as they eye supply, sales issues</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As concerns about the nation’s meat supply and its food processing plants rise, many grocery stores around the Pittsburgh area are moving to limit how much customers can buy in one trip as they try to keep the shelves stocked and consumers fed.</p>
<p>The impact of the strains on the meat section of stores appears uneven with one Shop ’n Save employee in Bethel Park on Monday reporting prices for roasts up $2 a pound in the last couple of weeks and a Trader Joe’s supervisor in East Liberty reporting no real issues, although noting the staff is keeping an eye out for customers who may be overstocking.</p>
<p>O’Hara-based grocer Giant Eagle announced this weekend that it is&nbsp;limiting the quantity of ground beef and weekly meat specials that individuals can buy at one time. The new policy is due to increased demand, rather than decreased supply, the company said.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The moves come at a time when thousands of workers at meatpacking plants around the country have been been infected by the new coronavirus, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which says 20 workers at meatpacking and other food-processing plants have died of COVID-19. After some plants shut down, President Donald Trump last week invoked emergency powers to get them back online and prevent a possible shortage in meat.</p>
<p>According to a report released last week by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pennsylvania leads the nation in confirmed cases of COVID-19 among meat production workers. Roughly&nbsp;22 meat- and poultry-processing plants in the state employed workers sickened by the coronavirus, the report says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With restaurants closed or offering takeout only, people are being forced to cook more. Some nervous customers may be stocking up, even as officials watch for potential supply issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giant Eagle said in a statement it is imposing limits on meat because it wants to serve as many customers as possible.&nbsp;“It is important to note that these temporary purchase limits are not indicative of meat supply issues but are based on increased demand by some guests,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Limits on advertised weekly specials cover all meat products, including beef, pork or chicken, the grocer’s spokesman Dick Roberts said Monday.&nbsp;“Giant Eagle wants to continue to offer popular products, but wants to ensure that everybody gets their fair share,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain Kroger has limited meat sales in some of its stores nationwide, while some independent owners of Shop ’n Save markets are doing the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shop ’n Save at Century Square Shopping Center in West Mifflin on Sunday began limiting ground meat purchases to no more than one large&nbsp;“value” package, according to the manager in the meat department who did not give his name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike at Giant Eagle, the limits stem from supply problems, he said. “Customers are being good about it. They aren’t hoarding,” he said.&nbsp;“We can’t get the product.”</p>
<p>At the Shop ’n Save on Library Road in Bethel Park, limits extend to ground meat and other beef products, such as steaks and roasts, said meat department employee Roberta Link.</p>
<p>As of the weekend, customers were being limited to two regular-sized packages in each category, she said.&nbsp;“We can’t get it from our supplier, and all of our prices went way up.” The biggest increase has been for roast, which has jumped by $2 per pound, she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Link said she understood that the limits were being enforced at eight other Shop ’n Save locations under the same ownership, most of them in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>Walmart officials said meat continues to be in high demand as customers stock up on protein. The Arkansas-based retailer said it is working through its supply chain to continually replenish items as quickly as possible. The company declined to comment on whether it has a limit on food purchases, or if rations may be on the horizon.</p>
<p>According to Trader Joe's supervisor Eamon McNamee in East Liberty, that store hasn't seen any major changes in food prices since the pandemic. People sometimes purchase items in bulk, but the store hasn't seen any food shortages, he said.</p>
<p>“We handle it on a case-by-case basis and just talk to people," Mr. McNamee said. “Like if they have a cart full of meat or food items, we might pull them aside and say, ‘Hey, we noticed you have a lot of food there. Any reason why?’ And they might say, ‘Oh, I have a family of 50 to feed,’ and then we would understand.</p>
<p>“We haven't set any hard limits on meat products or items at this time.”</p>
