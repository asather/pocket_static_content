<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Lake Erie&nbsp;</strong> (Erie County) Resident walleye went for live baits and plugs in nearshore areas of 10-25 feet. A few migrating walleye crossed the Ohio state line at 40-45 feet and went for blue or green lures. The Perch Pirate head boat reported good catches while drifting Erie Dearies with gold or bronze blades. About 80 boats were entered in last week’s Erie Spring Walleye Bash in Presque Isle Bay. Friday’s top catch was a 9.84-pound ’eye and a 9.88-pounder won on Saturday. Anglers trolling for walleye off Elk Creek caught some big catfish. Yellow perch, which have been hit-or-miss off the peninsula for several years, were caught in abundance in 35-40 feet off Shades Beach. The Father’s Day Buddy Tournament scheduled for June 21 at Presque Isle Bay was canceled.</p>
<p><strong>Pymatuning Reservoir</strong> (Crawford County) A 42¼-inch muskellunge was caught. Walleye were taken by anglers drifting or jigging live bait among stumps and in shallow weedbeds, and by trolling diving lures in about 20 feet. The bigger ’eyes were in deeper waters. Crappies and white bass were caught on the Ohio side near the Route 85 causeway. Duck-n-Drake in Andover, Ohio, will sponsor a walleye tournament June 27.
