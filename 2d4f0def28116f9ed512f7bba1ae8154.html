<h1>John Joyce, charting his own path, sees profile rise amid COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Less than two years ago, John Joyce had marked a quarter-century battling skin rashes, acne, psoriasis and varicose veins alongside his wife, Alice, in dermatology clinic positioned along a four-lane highway heading into Altoona, where they both were born and raised.</p>
<p>Today, the 63-year-old doctor finds himself in a position to advise senior U.S. lawmakers and Trump administration officials on China’s incursion into American society and the nature of global supply chains for medical supplies in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Dr. Joyce’s radical change in focus came with the territory of a first-term Republican lawmaker representing a newly redrawn 13th Congressional District.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Joyce, after leading a relatively quiet first year in Washington, has seen his profile rise in recent months as COVID-19 spread across the country.&nbsp;He has leaned on his experience in medicine and as a small business owner to gain influence and speak out as his party joined&nbsp;President Donald Trump in urging much of the country to allow businesses to reopen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This month, he was one of 15 House Republicans selected for the China Task Force, a Republican-led panel examining China’s influence, including its response to the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.</p>
<p>As he gains influence on Capitol Hill,&nbsp;Dr. Joyce is seeking to show he’s very much charting his own path in a seat that was occupied for 46 years by the political dynasty of Bud and Bill Shuster.</p>
<p>“I’ve established my own interest and own abilities to have positive impacts,” Dr. Joyce said in a phone interview this month, shortly after the first meeting of the task force.</p>
<p>“This has been an opportunity for Pennsylvania-13 to take someone who has a background in health care and take that skill set to Washington to work for them,” he said.&nbsp;“I answer to my constituents. They embrace me.”</p>
<p><strong>Deep pockets</strong></p>
<p>In January 2018, former Rep. Bill Shuster announced he would not seek re-election, leaving a void just five months before a crowded Republican primary election that effectively would determine the next representative of the deep-red district.</p>
<p>Mr. Shuster had held the seat since 2001, when he took the reins from his father, Bud, in a special election. Both father and son had rose to prominence in Washington serving as chair of the House Transportation Committee, where they traded in earmarks and pet projects.</p>
<p>While the Shusters helped build roads, bridges and airports, they also generated some local opposition for their stanglehold on the seat.</p>
<p>Two of those longtime opponents who competed in that 2018 primary included&nbsp;John Eichelberger, a Pennsylvania state senator with a long history of criticizing the Shusters, and Art Halvorson, a Bedford County resident who had unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Shuster in 2014 and 2016 Republican primary elections.</p>
<p>Mr. Halvorson, after narrowly losing the 2016 primary, then took the unusual step of launching write-in campaign as a Democrat to run against Mr. Shuster in the general election.</p>
<p>The mad dash to replace Mr. Shuster also included State Rep. Stephen Bloom and Doug Mastriano, a 54-year-old retired U.S. Army Colonel, and author of two books on military history, and himself a doctor — of history.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, statewide redistricting had expanded the district eastward, loosening Altoona’s grip as its geographic center.</p>
<p>In the chaos, Dr. Joyce emerged quickly on the scene with a wave of TV advertisements — and with&nbsp;few, if any, of the long-standing political grievances of his primary election opponents.</p>
<p>“John was unknown across the entire district,”&nbsp;Jim Foreman, chair of the Blair County Republican Committee, said.&nbsp;“The question for John Joyce was whether someone not in politics could in any way step into a Congressional seat and represent a new district.”</p>
<p>But Dr. Joyce had resources. He&nbsp;spent nearly $1.5 million, including $906,000 of his own money, on the race for Congress, according to federal election data. Advertisements flooded the airwaves. That compared to $350,000 spent by Mr. Bloom and $194,000 spent by Mr. Eichelberger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some bristled at his campaign, Mr. Foreman said, as opponents suspected that Mr. Shuster had hand-picked Dr. Joyce as a successor.&nbsp;Dr. Joyce’s son, Sean Joyce, worked as Mr. Shuster’s campaign manager in previous election cycles and as a Washington lobbyist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman said he didn’t believe there was any connection because&nbsp;“John would never agree to an arrangement” like that. Dr. Joyce’s office said he wanted to run because “none of the candidates were talking about health care.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Dr. Joyce beat out seven other Republicans, winning the primary election with 22% of the overall vote. He won the general election with 71% of the vote.</p>
<p>Mr. Shuster, who has since joined the lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs, said his schedule did not allow for an interview about Dr. Joyce.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement, he wrote that Dr. Joyce “has worked hard to unite the 10 counties of the new 13th Congressional District. Health care, national security, and the economy are the top issues currently facing this region, and there is no one better suited than John to fight for Pennsylvanians on these fronts.”</p>
<p><strong>Hit the ground running</strong></p>
<p>For all the prestige the Shusters held, a first-term congressman starts from scratch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Joyce opened four district offices, turning down Mr. Shuster’s Blair County office lease in favor of a smaller space.</p>
<p>Aside from budget constraints, “He wanted and needed his own identity,” Mr. Foreman said, telling himself, “‘I’m not taking over Bill Shuster’s space. I’m not sitting in the chair he sat in.’”</p>
<p>Dr. Joyce was assigned to the House committees overseeing homeland security and small business, serving as the top Republican on a subcommittee on rural development, agriculture, trade and entrepreneurship. He&nbsp;“hit the ground running,”&nbsp;said&nbsp;Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Centre, the dean of the Pennsylvania GOP delegation.</p>
<p>“He didn’t come with any type of political baggage or bad habits,” said Mr. Thompson, who also came from a health care background and had no political experience when he took office in 2009. The two lawmakers have worked together on dairy issues, like allowing whole flavored milk back into school lunches.</p>
<p>“In health care, you diagnose a problem,” Mr. Thompson said. “You also kind of diagnose when it comes to the issues people are confronting, and then you come up with cost-effective solutions.”</p>
<p><strong>Immigration, dairy and China</strong></p>
<p>In his first months, it was immigration that took priority, as Dr. Joyce pressed for Congress to approve funding for Mr. Trump’s border wall — an issue that had led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.</p>
<p>He made headlines after an Arizona border visit in April 2019 in which he repeated a false claim that immigrants were bringing drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis. He <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/04/24/how-a-republican-border-trip-amplified-a-bogus-tuberculosis-rumor/" target="_blank">pulled back on the statement</a> shortly after.</p>
<p>He has sponsored two bills, including one that passed the House in December that requires the Transportation Security Administration to create a task force to assess new threats. The Senate is considering it. That same month, he took to the House floor to support the Republican plan to lower prescription drug prices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to his office, he&nbsp;has hosted nearly 300 meetings in his district, a rugged, rural stretch that includes 10 counties spanning from Westmoreland County to Gettysburg.</p>
<p>With the COVID-19 outbreak, Dr. Joyce urged caution and supported the economic rescue packages that have hurtled through Congress. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent weeks, however, he has called on Gov. Tom Wolf to allow his district to reopen.</p>
<p>“It’s like going to school, and working hard and studying hard and passing the test — and still being in detention,” he said in a video posted this month to Twitter.&nbsp;“It’s time to allow these people to go back to work.”</p>
<p>And he is turning focus to China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We cannot forget where this virus originated,” he said in the interview, shortly after the first meeting of the China Task Force concluded. “There must be international accountability for how this virus originated and any deliberate misinformation that allowed it to spread.”&nbsp;</p>
