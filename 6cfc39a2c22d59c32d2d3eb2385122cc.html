<h1>Allegations of racist comments put Judge Tranquilli under scrutiny</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In 2015, Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Mark V. Tranquilli was leading a custody conciliation with African American parents in the chambers of his family division courtroom, when, an attorney who was present said, he slipped into Ebonics.</p>
<p>As the judge explained how the parents were to comport themselves during a custody exchange, he talked about how they should communicate with each other.</p>
<p>“When he spoke to the issue of interpersonal communication, he inexplicably began to speak in Ebonics,” the attorney wrote in a complaint to the state Judicial Conduct Board dated Feb. 7. The attorney continued quoting Judge Tranquilli,&nbsp; “’And when I say communication, I don’t mean, ‘and den da bitch done dis, and den da bitch done dat.’”</p>
<p>The allegations, reported to the board only recently, come as the judge —&nbsp;who is white —&nbsp;is under scrutiny after being removed from hearing all cases following a highly publicized incident in January in which he is accused of referring to a black juror as “Aunt Jemima,” in chambers.</p>
<p>“The rules and laws of our Commonwealth forbid judges, including Judge Tranquilli, from making any public comments or offering any defense or explanation to any charges. Judge Tranquilli respects the rule of law,” the judge’s attorney, Matt Logue, said.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli, who was elected to the court in 2013 and assumed a seat in family division in January 2014, is restricted to administrative duties as he is being investigated by the board after being accused of making racist statements while in chambers following a jury trial in January.</p>
<p>On Monday, Westmoreland County Senior Judge Richard E. McCormick Jr. took over the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas Phoenix docket, which expedites certain kinds of cases, on a full-time basis, while Judge Bruce Beemer, who was just officially sworn in last month, took over Judge Tranquilli’s regular docket of approximately 250 cases, including sex offender court.</p>
<p>According to an initial complaint filed with the Judicial Conduct Board by defense attorney Joe Otte, Judge Tranquilli was upset by a not-guilty verdict in a drug case. During discussions with the attorneys in chambers, the judge criticized the prosecutor for “allowing ‘Aunt Jemima’ on the jury.” The woman to whom he referred, Juror No. 4, the complaint said, was a young black woman who wore a hair wrap.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli also indicated he knew that the woman’s “baby daddy” probably sells heroin and that her bias led to the not guilty verdict, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Mr. Otte confirmed this week he has been interviewed by the Judicial Conduct Board investigator, a retired FBI agent, but would not comment further.</p>
<p>According to the family court attorney involved in the 2015 case, who asked not to be named, he spoke with the investigator last week.</p>
<p>That attorney believes, based on the wide-ranging questions the investigator asked, that the area of inquiry is broader than just the recent comments by Judge Tranquilli.</p>
<p><strong>Recent complaints</strong></p>
<p>Several defense attorneys in criminal court have complained about Judge Tranquilli, a long-time prosecutor, for months, alleging that he forces defendants into plea agreements, has a prosecutorial bent and makes intemperate remarks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one hearing on Oct. 31, 2018, he questioned a woman pleading guilty to drug charges about having two children out of wedlock.</p>
<p>“[A]re you familiar with the phrase, if you lay down with dogs, you wake up with fleas?” he asked her, according to a transcript. “So now, you have laid down twice with dogs, but you have woken up with two lovely children, probably two lovely children I’m betting you were probably not planning on.</p>
<p>“And for the cost of three shiny quarters in any bathroom in any rest stop in Pennsylvania, you probably could have gone a different direction.”</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli also is known for giving the same lengthy speech to defendants to warn them against violating any conditions of probation they might have.</p>
<p>“I have a notoriously low tolerance for misbehavior. I was a district attorney for 20 years, and for the last 13 years, all I did was dead body cases, dead body, dead body, dead body,” he said, according to an Oct. 31, 2018, court transcript.&nbsp;“For the last eight years, I ran the homicide unit. If I had a nickel for every picture of a dead person I looked at on my desk while I was eating a turkey sandwich, I could retire right now and be a rich man. As a result of these experiences, there is no milk of human kindness left in these veins. It is just too much death.”</p>
<p>He uses the line about laying down with dogs often. And inquires about whether the defendants before him have children. In one instance, according to a transcript from a July 16, 2019, hearing, when a defendant said he did not, Judge Tranquilli said, “Well, you’re a young man. I think probably we should keep it that way. Because you have enough on your plate for the next four years to worry about your own self instead of having anything else to worry about.</p>
<p>“I am not saying that because I am not a family man,” the transcript continued.&nbsp;“I have three kids of my own. My parents got married when they were 20 because they had to, because my mother got in trouble.</p>
<p>“They got married, and it didn’t last long. You know, so just keep your eye on the ball.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are other complaints about him, too.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli refuses to accept pleas to summary charges before him, declaring that he is not a magistrate judge. In one instance, that standing policy led to a four-day jury trial. In the end, the jury hung on one count and acquitted on the others.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys also have complained that he tries to force defendants before him to take a plea deal —&nbsp;even if the prosecution is not ready to proceed to trial</p>
<p>In one instance, according to one defense attorney, after a prosecutor tried to postpone a case at the first listing, the judge asked her if she had made an offer to the defendant. She confirmed she had —&nbsp;a misdemeanor with probation to be set by the court —&nbsp;and Judge Tranquilli told the defendant that if he agreed to grant the postponement, the defendant would not get the same deal in the future.</p>
<p>The defendant went out into the hallway, returned to the courtroom a short time later and took the plea, the attorney said.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli also is known for having a zero-tolerance policy for drug violations by his probationers, including for marijuana. So much so that in October, he threatened to jail county probation officers if they failed to report their clients in violation of probation when they tested positive for marijuana.</p>
<p>“You have absolutely no discretion to tinker with my zero-tolerance policy,” the judge told the officers standing before him. “It’s my job. I wear the black dress. I make the call.</p>
<p>“This is an order. If my order is disregarded, somebody’s going to be held in contempt, and I don’t mess around with fines.</p>
<p>“They’re going to the county jail.”</p>
<p>Defense attorney Phil DiLucente said he has represented men and women, African American and Caucasian defendants before Judge Tranquilli.</p>
<p>“When I heard of the alleged statements made, I found it to be very inconsistent behavior in my dealings with him&nbsp; as a defense lawyer these last 18 years in which he was a prosecutor and now judge,” Mr. DiLucente said. “I didn’t feel his temperament affected the results of my clients’ cases.”</p>
<p>During his time on the bench, Judge Tranquilli has been asked to meet with both administrative and president judges to discuss some of the complaints raised by the attorneys who have appeared before him. However, none of those judges would talk about what was said or the outcome of those conversations.</p>
<p>Richard Long, chief counsel for the Pennsylvania Judicial Conduct Board, said he could neither confirm nor deny whether there is a current or past investigation into Judge Tranquilli.</p>
<p>Talking broadly about the board’s process, however, he said that once any investigation into a judge is complete, the investigator will present the findings to the board, which will determine if probable cause exists to show the judge committed misconduct.</p>
<p>The board votes and then, if that probable cause exists, may authorize the public filing of a report with the Court of Judicial Discipline.</p>
<p>Mr. Long said the board investigation is not limited in its scope.</p>
<p>“It depends on the case,” he said. “It depends on how many allegations there are.</p>
<p>“An investigation can expand upon the initial allegations based upon new information learned in the investigation.”</p>
<p>In the case involving the 2015 family court conciliation, the attorney involved did not file a formal complaint with the Judicial Conduct Board until after he learned that Judge Tranquilli was being investigated in February.</p>
<p>He filed the complaint, he said, because to him it showed “a pattern of behavior.”</p>
<p>In addition to Judge Tranquilli speaking in Ebonics, he also referred to the attorney’s client as the “deadbeat baby daddy,” which most offended the man, the attorney said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>His client was married to the mother of his children and was employed, the attorney said.</p>
<p>“He always talks about deadbeat baby daddies, so that was nothing out of the ordinary,” the attorney said.</p>
<p>At that same conciliation, the attorney wrote in his complaint, Judge Tranquilli told the parents that “he did not care about their children.”</p>
<p>Instead, he told them his only concern were his own three children, and he pointed at their pictures behind his desk.</p>
<p>Then, the attorney continued, the judge told the parents that “he was merely passing time in the family division of the court until his eventual assignment to the criminal division.”</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli said “that he wasn’t the ‘brain surgeon that all the other family division judges think they are. I’m more of a slice and dice guy.’”</p>
