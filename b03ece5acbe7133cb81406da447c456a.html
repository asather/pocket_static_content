<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Federal and state authorities on Tuesday said 33 people, including eight jail and prison inmates and their accomplices, have been charged with illegally obtaining COVID-19 relief through fraudulent claims.</p>
<p>"These defendants took advantage of a public health emergency to cash in on the backs of working people across our Commonwealth," said Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro in a statement announcing the charges.</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro appeared with U.S. Attorney Scott Brady and other officials from the FBI, Secret Service and other agencies at the federal courthouse in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>"These inmates and their accomplices took advantage of this national emergency to line their pockets through fraud," Mr. Brady said. "Their conduct is despicable at any time, but particularly in a time of a national emergency."</p>
<p>These are the people charged:</p>
<p>● Jessica Rae Conrad and Homer Mizenko of Kiskiminetas Township, Armstrong County. They are accused of fraudulently signing people up for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits who they knew were not eligible for benefits in exchange for a fee, usually $1,000 a person. Both are charged with conspiracy and theft by deception.</p>
