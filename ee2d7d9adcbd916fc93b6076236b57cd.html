<h1>Washington governor’s directive caps a day of several stay-at-home orders</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>SEATTLE — To combat the novel coronavirus, Gov. Jay Inslee is ordering Washington residents to stay at home, except for crucial activities like buying groceries, seeking medical care or going to work at essential businesses, and except for outdoor activities that can be done 6 feet away from others.</p>
<p>The new order also requires the closure of nonessential businesses and, the governor said, “is enforceable by law,” though crackdowns by officers aren’t expected.</p>
<p>“This is a human tragedy on a scale we cannot yet project,” Inslee said about the pandemic in a live televised address Monday evening. “It’s time to hunker down in order to win this fight.”</p>
<p>Inslee joined governors across the nation Monday in taking stronger action by issuing stay-at-home orders in their states.</p>
<p>By Wednesday, when all 13 current state orders take effect, 133,018,203 people — or 40% of the US population —&nbsp;will be officially urged to stay home.</p>
<p>Outside of Washington, Indiana, Michigan, Oregon and Pennsylvania announced stay-at-home orders Monday implemented that were implemented the same day.&nbsp;Michigan's governor also issued a stay-at-home order that would go into effect shortly after midnight Tuesday.</p>
<p>For Inslee’s part, the stay-at-home order goes into effect immediately and will last for a minimum of two weeks, the governor said. It bans all gatherings of people for social, spiritual and recreational purposes, whether by public or private groups. That includes weddings and funerals. Any nonessential businesses still operating must close in 48 hours.</p>
<p>“This does not mean you cannot go outdoors, if you feel like going for a walk, gardening or going for a bike ride,” Inslee said in remarks that lasted about 13 minutes. “We just all need to practice social distancing of at least 6 feet.”</p>
<p>Inslee said he had hoped a mandate would not be necessary. “But I have heard from health professionals, local officials and others that people still aren’t practicing these precautions,” he said. “If you want to have parties on the beach or play pickup basketball at the park or have sleepovers, these are no longer allowed for at least a couple weeks.”</p>
<p>The governor is not yet asking law enforcement agencies to actively enforce his stay-at-home order, King County Sheriff Mitzi Johanknecht said in a statement, “and we see no need to do so.”Johanknecht’s deputies will take “an educational approach” if they see banned gatherings, she said.</p>
<p>Washington’s definition of “essential business” is modeled on lists developed by the federal government and by California. Restaurants will be allowed to offer take-out and delivery, and supermarkets, pharmacies, food banks, convenience stores, banks and laundromats will be allowed to remain open, among other establishments.</p>
<p>Still, a range of businesses will be shuttered, and some construction sites likely will need to shut down.</p>
<p>Inslee said the decision was difficult and acknowledged the move would “add to the economic and family hardship that many in our state are already feeling.” But he argued the order was the best choice.</p>
<p>“The fastest way to get back to normal is to hit this hard,” he said, describing social distancing as “the only weapon against this virus.”</p>

<p>Inslee’s order followed a wave of similar decrees by states including California, New York, Oregon, which have in the last few days shuttered nonessential business and ordered residents to stay home.</p>
<p>The global pandemic has been especially severe in Washington, which had the first reported outbreak in the U.S., and had 2,221 known cases and at least 110 deaths as of Monday.</p>
<p>In response, Inslee had issued an escalating array of orders banning large public gatherings, had prohibited sit-in dining at restaurants and had urged residents to voluntarily self-isolate as much as possible. One March 12 he ordered public schools in three counties to close. Then, a day later he ordered all K-12 schools statewide to close through April 24.</p>
<p>Yet as of last week, he had said it was not yet time to order Washingtonians to remain at home, and that the state still had unused tools before such a step would need to be invoked.</p>
<p>The governor had faced increasing pressure to impose more forceful measures amid reports that some people have been ignoring public-health warnings and continuing to gather in close proximity at some parks and beaches.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on Monday, Indiana&nbsp;Gov. Eric Holcomb issued a stay-at-home order that goes into effect Tuesday just before midnight and lasts until April 6.</p>
<p>Essential employees, including health care workers, grocery and transit workers, among others, can leave their home. Indiana residents can leave their home to exercise, Holcomb said.</p>
<p>The governor added that the Indiana National Guard is not assisting with enforcing the order, but it is assisting in the distribution of hospital supplies the state receives.</p>
<p>Next door in Michigan,&nbsp;Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered her state’s residents to stay at home unless they are critical workers. The order goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday and will last for at least the next three weeks, according to a news release from her office.</p>
<p>Whitmer is banning gatherings, public and private, of any number of people. This does not apply to single households where people may already live together.</p>
<p>"This is an unprecedented crisis that requires all of us working together to protect our families and our communities," Whitmer said in the news release. "If we all come together, get serious, and do our part by staying home, we can stay safe and save lives."</p>
<p>And in Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown issued an executive order telling her state’s residents to stay home except for essential needs.</p>
<p>The order, effective immediately, prohibits all nonessential social and recreational gatherings, regardless of size, according to her office.</p>
<p>The order closes retail businesses in which close personal contact is difficult to avoid, such as barber shops, arcades, gyms and theaters. Businesses that are not closed by the order must implement social distancing policies in order to remain open, her office said.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the new order could be punished as a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>"If businesses are not complying with this order, we will shut them down," Brown said.</p>
