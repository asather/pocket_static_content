<h1>McKeesport man accused of stealing from North Versailles Fire Department</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former employee at the North Versailles Fire Department used his position to steal money from the department for his own personal benefit, the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office said Thursday.</p>
<p>The DA’s office alleges that Ryan Marton, 48, of McKeesport, utilized his role as department business manager to take over $1,700 from the department’s Social Club fund to finance his own child support payments.</p>
<p>Mr. Marton also is accused of using his account as business manager to fraudulently create a $60,000 tax liability for the department after his termination.</p>
<p>According to the affidavit of probable cause, Mr. Marton was hired on as the department’s business manager in April 2013, making him responsible for overseeing the department’s EMS and Social Club operations.</p>
<p>Before his termination in January 2019, Mr. Marton had allegedly mailed checks from the department’s bank account to the Pennsylvania Child Support Program at various points in 2018 and early 2019.</p>
<p>In mid-May 2019, after attempting to purchase items for the Social Club with the department’s credit card, North Versailles Fire Department Treasurer Michael Logan discovered that the state Department of Revenue had withdrawn all of the remaining money in the fire department’s Social Club bank account.</p>
<p>Following an investigation into the withdrawal, the affidavit said, Mr. Logan found that the state had recently assessed the fire department as liable for approximately $60,000 in state taxes.</p>
<p>According to the affidavit, someone using Mr. Marton’s department username and email address had logged into the state tax system several weeks earlier and had fraudulently entered approximately $400,000 in taxable revenue for the department.</p>
<p>Over a period of several months, detectives working with the District Attorney’s office discovered that the person who had logged into the tax system with Mr. Marton’s account had done so on an IP address linked to Mr. Marton’s home address in McKeesport.</p>
<p>During a voluntary interview with detectives in March, Mr. Marton stated that the department’s board had agreed to pay his child support payments after he was placed on an involuntary leave of absence. Mr. Marton also stated during the interview that he had no reason to illegally change the department’s tax liabilities.</p>
<p>Detectives found through further interviews with the department’s former board members that no such arrangement about Mr. Marton’s child support payments was made.</p>
<p>Mike Manko, the spokesman for the district attorney’s office, said Mr. Marton turned himself in to detectives working with the DA’s office on Thursday morning after a warrant for his arrest was issued on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Marton charged with theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, misapplication of entrusted property and property of government or financial institutions and unlawful use of computer and other computer crimes.</p>
<p>Mr. Marton is currently awaiting arraignment.</p>
