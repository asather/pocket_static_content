<h1>PA Turnpike switches to cashless system despite struggles to collect mailed bills</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Turnpike is replacing human toll collectors with an electronic system that only generates payments from 65% of the motorists who use the system. The rest goes to a collection agency.</p>
<p>Turnpike officials told members of two state Senate committees last week that 35% of motorists who use the Toll-By-Plate system — which will be used instead of about 500 toll collectors <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/06/02/Pa-Turnpike-permanently-going-cashless-immediately-500-toll-collectors-losing-jobs-layoffs/stories/202006020113" target="_blank">who were laid off beginning last week</a> — don’t pay bills they receive from the agency. Under the system, motorists who don’t use a prepaid E-ZPass transponder have a photo taken of their license plate and the turnpike mails them a bill for the toll.</p>
<p>Overall, cash and Toll-By-Plate amounts to about 15% of the turnpike’s $1.4 billion a year in toll revenue. The rest is collected through E-ZPass.</p>
<p>The agency said its experience since it began using toll-by-plate a few years ago on the Delaware River Bridge showed about 65% of customers pay bills they receive in the mail. That figure has held about the same since the agency began using toll-by-plate across its system in March to limit contact between collectors and motorists as the pandemic was in its early stages.</p>
<p>The plan had been to return to toll collectors when the virus restrictions eased and continue using them through 2021, but the agency believes the cashless system has worked well and decided to switch to that option immediately by laying off the toll collectors.</p>
<p>Senators who sit on the Labor and Industry Committee, which oversees employment, and the Transportation Committee <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/06/15/pa-Turnpike-Pennsylvania-Senate-hearing-toll-collectors-layoffs-COVID-19/stories/202006150071" target="_blank">questioned turnpike officials about the move during a hearing Monday</a>.</p>
<p>Turnpike CEO Mark Compton and Craig Shuey, chief operating officer, acknowledged the agency had repeatedly told officials from the Teamsters union as late as April that toll collectors would have jobs through next year. But losses of more than $100 million since March, the uncertainty of resuming interpersonal contact and the success of the cashless system made it an opportune time to adopt that system permanently, they said.</p>
<p>Under questioning by Sen. Christine Tartaglione, D-Philadelphia, and others, Mr. Shuey said the amount of money collected by cash and now toll-by-plate is relatively small. The agency is taking steps to&nbsp;increase enforcement for those who don’t pay.</p>

<p>The system works like this: For motorists who don’t have E-ZPass, the turnpike takes a license plate photo each time they go through a toll plaza. The agency waits a few weeks to see if there are additional trips before sending an initial bill with 30 days to pay.</p>
<p>If the motorist doesn’t pay, they receive a late notice with an additional $5 fee. If they still don’t pay&nbsp;— and 35% don’t&nbsp;— the bill is sent to a collection agency that usually recovers about 10% of the late bills.</p>
<p>The remainder often goes uncollected.</p>
<p>The agency declined interview requests for additional information about toll-by-plate collections because it hadn’t responded yet to Senate requests for more details.</p>
<p>In addition to sending delinquent&nbsp;bills to a collection agency, Mr. Shuey said the turnpike is taking other steps to improve collection. It has won criminal convictions against several of the most serious scofflaws who owe the agency thousands and is working on cooperative agreements with neighboring states to go after others.</p>
<p>Out-of-state drivers have been a particular problem for enforcement.</p>
<p>For in-state drivers, the agency can ask the state Department of Transportation to suspend the vehicle registration for chronic scofflaws. But it can’t go after out-of-state drivers that way without cooperation from officials there and those agreements have been hard to come by because each state has different penalties.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania should have an agreement with Delaware soon to allow penalties for each other’s scofflaws, Mr. Shuey said, and New Jersey and New York officials have reached out to discuss a reciprocity agreement. So far, Ohio has no interest, he said.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s switch to all-electronic tolling is part of a national trend that has been adopted by nearly half of the toll agencies across the country, the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association said. Of the 341 toll agencies in the U.S., 164 have cashless systems and many of the remaining 177 take cash as well as offering electronic tolling, according to IBTTA TollMiner.</p>
<p>The association doesn’t keep track of toll collection rates for states that use electronic tolling.</p>
<p>Overall, Mr. Shuey said laying off the toll collectors would save the agency about $107 million through the end of 2021 once unemployment, severance and other costs are considered. He said he couldn’t say how long it would take for the switch to cashless tolling to have a positive financial effect on the agency.</p>
<p>Sen. Kim Ward, R-Hempfield and chairwoman of the Transportation Committee, and Sen. Camera Bartolotta, R-Monongahela, who heads the Labor and Industry Committee, said they would work to find money to reinstate the workers through 2021.</p>
