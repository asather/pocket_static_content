<h1>CMU refuses to cave </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>College campuses are oft-maligned these days as bastions of progressivism, liberal bubbles where students are indoctrinated into a leftist propaganda machine.</p>
<p>This is an exaggeration of course.</p>
<p>But statistics on academic appointments and professorial political leanings do reveal an overwhelmingly liberal bias on campuses that of course permeates the student body to some extent. And cancel culture is particularly fierce on college campuses, as plenty of right-of-center speakers can and have loudly attested in recent years.</p>
<p>For this reason alone, Carnegie Mellon University’s one-year appointment of Richard Grenell, former U.S. ambassador to Germany and current acting director of the Office of National Intelligence, should be applauded. He doesn’t fit the mold.</p>
<p>An internal review recently confirmed that Mr. Grenell’s appointment was aboveboard in terms of university policy after a firestorm of backlash kicked up in June at the news of his engagement.</p>
<p>Bravo to CMU for sticking to its guns and not canceling Mr. Grenell.</p>
<p>Faculty and students alike pointed to Mr. Grenell’s supposed lack of qualifications, his degrading comments about the appearances of some women and his association with the far-right political group Alternative for Germany among reasons to withdraw his appointment.</p>
<p>But his hiring shouldn’t be a referendum on his personal character, and administrators should not be beholden to petitions.</p>
<p>A university is a place for free discourse and learning, where ideas are given voice or defeated, not simply silenced. Hiring controversial figures should be a higher priority in such decisions.</p>
<p>Mr. Grenell, an appointee of President Donald Trump, will not teach, but he will engage with the campus in a variety of forums as a member of the Institute for Politics and Strategy. The college expects him to “conduct his business and related professional activities in good faith and with fairness, accuracy, integrity and respect for others,” according to the internal review committee.</p>
<p>Students who disagree with his positions should participate in such forums and air their policy concerns and take advantage of Mr. Grenell’s government experience, regardless of their views on his personal ethics. It’s an opportunity to learn about and engage with a perspective rarely welcome on such campuses.</p>
<p>Protecting people from viewpoints they don’t like or don’t disagree with only incubates stagnation.</p>
<p>Mr. Grenell’s comments and affiliations can’t all be condoned, but his appearance at CMU isn’t a tacit endorsement. It’s about providing a unique opportunity to students; it should spur debate and study and greater engagement with the broader world of ideas.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t that be the point of college?</p>
