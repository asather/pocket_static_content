<h1>Pitt basketball blows late lead and falls to Louisville in overtime</h1>

<p>By Craig Meyer / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</p>
<p>It was all there for Pitt, a game in which victory seemed to be within reach more times than the fingers on that reaching hand could count.</p>
<p>Against No. 11 Louisville Tuesday night, the Panthers led for 33 of the first 40 minutes. With about three minutes remaining, that advantage was all the way up to seven after a 3-pointer from Trey McGowens that sent an already charged crowd into hysteria. The energy sent a clear message. Joy, sure, but also a mounting sense of belief. Maybe, just maybe this would happen.</p>
<p>After the disappointment of an eight-point loss Sunday at Miami, it appeared as though Pitt was about to do what it has for so much of its season -- looking so underwhelming in one moment but so inspired in the next. This time, it would have come complete with a win against not only a top-15 team, but one of the most accomplished programs in college basketball history.</p>
<p>Faced with that opportunity, the Panthers were unable to hold on, watching control slip away from them until, ultimately, it was too late. McGowens poured in 24 points, the second time he has done so in the past six days, but Pitt was undone by late, untimely offensive miscues and, for the second time in as many games against Louisville this season, a controversial foul call in a 73-68 overtime loss against the Cardinals at Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>Trailing by two, 70-68, with about 30 seconds remaining in the extra period, Pitt had just forced a turnover on a Louisville inbounds pass, getting an opportunity to take a late lead in a game it had, before that turnover, merely been hoping to stay in. After a McGowens runner went awry, it looked to be tipped in by center Terrell Brown, but he was called for a foul, though it looked on replay like the 6-foot-10 junior had merely reached his straightened arm over Louisville’s Malik Williams to touch the ball with minimal, if any, contact.</p>
<p>The Cardinals made both free throws on the other end to push their lead to two possessions with 21 seconds remaining, ending any realistic hope the Panthers had left for a victory.</p>
<p>“I’m not commenting on any call, anything that an official made,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “I can’t. I don’t want to lose money.”</p>
<p>“That was crazy,” Louisville forward Dwayne Sutton said. “I’ve never seen anything like that. I’m just glad Malik boxed out and got the over-the-back call.”</p>
<p>McGowens, an unpaid amateur athlete who ostensibly doesn’t have money the ACC could collect as a fine, also declined comment when asked about the play.</p>
<p>The call was undeniably consequential, a four-point swing that gave Louisville a comfortable lead in a game that otherwise would have been tied. To say Pitt lost the game with that whistle, though, would be discounting and maybe even ignoring any number of errors on its own part -- namely, how it was even in that position at all.</p>
<p>For all but 4:14 of the second half, the Panthers led by at least four points, staying ahead of Louisville to the point where it fell back out of striking distance within seconds of getting there. When McGowens banked his 3 off the glass to put Pitt up seven, his team, according to ESPN statistics, had an 88 percent chance of winning the game.</p>
<p>From there, it crumbled. Pitt didn’t score again for the remainder of regulation, missing its final three shots and six of its eight attempts in overtime. Over the final 12:54, it made just three shots. While all that was transpiring, it saw its usually reliable defense come apart, giving up seven points in just 122 seconds to send the game into the extra period.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Capel had discussed the challenges his team would face with a two-day turnaround, one that forced them to play 47 hours after the Miami loss had finished, which happened to also be the Panthers’ longest road trip of ACC play. Capel said after the game that the loss Tuesday and the late shortcomings weren’t a product of fatigue, even on a night in which Pitt played just seven players.</p>
<p>More than anything, according to Capel and McGowens, it was the product of a series of mental breakdowns.</p>
<p>“When you're playing against really good teams and elite teams — and I think Louisville is an elite team — they make you pay for stuff like that,” Capel said. “That's what talent, that's what guys that are older and that's what elite does. They make you pay when you make mistakes. So you have to minimize as many mistakes. For the most part, I thought we did that. But when we had some of those breakdowns, they made us pay.”</p>
<p>Tuesday’s loss was a continuation of a recent spurt for McGowens. The sophomore had scored in double figures in each of Pitt’s previous six games, averaging 16.5 points and 4.3 assists per game in that span. On the season, he’s the team’s leading scorer at 13.2 points per game. Though his shot selection remained questionable at times, he accounted for 38.1 percent of his team’s made field goals and 35.3 percent of its points.</p>
<p>Justin Champagnie and Xavier Johnson also finished in double figures, scoring 11 apiece.</p>
<p>After coming into the evening shooting just 29.5 percent from beyond the arc as a team, ranking it among the 40 worst teams in Division I, Pitt made six of its first 11 3s, but missed seven of its final eight. In the first half, the Panthers had surged out to a lead by making any number of unusual, seemingly low-percentage shots, from a series of heaves from McGowens to a one-legged turnaround from Champagnie to a hotly contested mid-range jumper from forward Eric Hamilton that just beat the shot clock at the end of the half.</p>
<p>Against Louisville’s stingy pack-line defense -- a unit that ranks among the top 15 teams in Division I in defensive efficiency by clogging up lanes and limiting dribble penetration -- such shots don’t pave a reliable path to victory.</p>
<p>“Even a couple of shots that they hit -- McGowens off the glass, Eric Hamilton at the end of the shot clock right before the half -- whatever team shoots those type of shots against that type of defense consistently, you’re not going to win,” Louisville coach Chris Mack said. “If we could do that in the second half and make their looks tough, we felt like we could give ourselves a chance to win.”</p>
<p>When those shots stopped falling, it found offense elsewhere. Unlike their first matchup with Louisville, one in which they attempted a season-low six free throws, the Panthers excelled at getting to the line as they have for so much of the season, getting 26 free throws (of which, they made 19).</p>
<p>“Coach just preached going into this game ‘Attack, attack, attack,’” Toney said.</p>
<p>As the final buzzer sounded and the crowd emptied, boos were showered upon the court, a dissatisfied audience letting the officials know just how frustrated they were with how the final minutes transpired.</p>
<p>Disappointing as the loss was for the players who walked back to the locker room, it was perhaps a sign of growth. A team that fell by 18 to Louisville a month earlier, albeit in a game in which the final score a bit misleading, very nearly beat it Tuesday and likely should have. With that solace, however, comes a sting.</p>
<p>“I think we're getting better,” Capel said. “It doesn't show all the time. We have to become consistent. That's the thing we're striving to become. We're not there yet. We showed some signs. But in order to become really good, you have to be consistent. And that's what we're trying to do. We've shown it in spurts. But we have to do it consistently.”</p>
