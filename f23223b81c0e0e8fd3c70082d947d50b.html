<h1>Group calls for Pittsburghers to light up buildings, homes to thank essential workers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At 8 p.m. on Tuesday, a number of Pittsburgh buildings and homes will be illuminated as people step outside to applaud front-line workers for their tireless efforts to serve and care for people during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Considering the reach of the organizer and her team, the response could be dramatic for what is being called “Illumination Ovation.”</p>

<p>Evelyn Castillo, of Squirrel Hill, hopes that this event spreads to other towns and cities and that it will be repeated locally. The owner of Sterling Events, an event planning consulting firm, Ms. Castillo is married to a physician and has a son who works at a Philadelphia grocery store.</p>
<p>With her own personal concerns and appreciation, she picked up on the idea from a friend in London — native Pittsburgher Jennifer Evans — who she said participated in such a moment in London, “when everyone came out onto their sidewalks and stoops and clapped for two minutes. She contacted me about it, and I said, ‘Why can’t we do that here?’ Then I said, ‘Oh, wait, why don’t I do that here?’</p>
<p>“I contacted a bunch of friends and colleagues.”</p>
<p>A board member of Multiplying Good, the former Jefferson Awards Foundation, and the Mon Valley Community Foundation, as well as a trustee of Awesome Pittsburgh, she began spreading the word among her collection of contacts. She pinpointed people she knew had many contacts of their own.</p>
<p>She organized six people to split up the workload in contacting the owners of Downtown Pittsburgh and near-Downtown buildings and many other groups to get a commitment to light up.</p>
<p>“I have a core group of organizers who came on board,” Ms. Castillo said.&nbsp;“My vision is to thank everyone who is an essential worker. They’re out there. We all know someone who’s on the front lines.</p>
<p>“This is a small show of appreciation for all they’re doing so that we can stay home and be comfortable.</p>
<p>“Everybody is doing this [event] for free. It’s a way to bring us together while were apart. Maybe we could start a wave across the country.”</p>
<p>She encourages people to take videos and send them to the Love from Pgh Facebook page: “We want this to be a thank you note.”</p>
<p>One of her contacts, Kit Mueller, a consultant to business start-ups, posted on Facebook, “Let’s show those on the frontlines some #LovefromPgh during this week's Illumination Ovation event.”</p>
<p>He said the group contacted chambers of commerce, neighborhood organizations and other community groups to spread the word so that the applause and lights spread to neighborhood streets.</p>
<p>“Most of the major buildings Downtown have agreed to light up,” he said. “We want to spread the gratitude, safely. This has been trending on Next Door and Facebook. It’s been amazing how people have picked up on this. We’re hoping it becomes a weekly thing.”</p>
<p>Nancy Shelton works in behavioral health with the Mon Yough Community Services and lives in Pleasant Hills. She was on Ms. Castillo’s contact list and began mobilizing to contact hospitals to do their own light-up in appreciation for their workers.</p>
<p>“If you are a doer, wanting to help, it’s hard doing that sitting at home,” she said. “We want to do tangible things” that are risky now. “So we are asking people to make sure they fill out the U.S. Census form and to apply to vote by mail.”</p>
<p>She said she has sent invitations to more than 100 entities encouraging them to illuminate and applaud essential workers.</p>
<p>“I have a ton of friends among them and I am worried to death for them because a lot of people have been slow to adopt these protective measures.”</p>
<p>Artist Jena-Anne Sabom, in Mount Washington, jumped on Ms. Castillo’s team last week. She was in a women’s networking group with her years ago.</p>
<p>Ms. Sabom said this effort resonates widely because everyone knows someone who is out there, taking risks helping others.</p>
<p>“Over the weekend, I was making a huge illuminated heart to put in my front window,” she said. “I have been using social media to spread the word and I contacted the Mount Washington Community Development Corp., and they forwarded it to condos and large buildings. Let’s get this started and see where it goes.”</p>
<p>Like many independent and gig workers, she is “hanging in there,” she said. “I’m channeling my power for good.”</p>
