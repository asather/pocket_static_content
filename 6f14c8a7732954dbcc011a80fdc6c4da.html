<h1>Pennsylvania child care centers at 'breaking point' due to mandated COVID-19 closures</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Child care providers throughout Pennsylvania — most of which have been temporarily shuttered since last week — say they might not be able to reopen for business without direct and immediate state aid, should the closure last beyond a month.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, several statewide child care advocacy groups said action is needed from the governor and legislature to preserve child care for essential workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic — and to ensure the system's survival for when all families are able to return to work.</p>
<p>The system is “truly at a breaking point,” said Cara Ciminillo, executive director of Pittsburgh-based advocacy organization Trying Together, speaking Tuesday on a conference call with reporters.</p>
<p>Providers are being hammered by a combination of an already fragile infrastructure and staff that often earn low wages, combined with the sudden halt of tuition payments from parents and the prospect of an uncertain and potentially prolonged period of closure.</p>
<p>Governor Tom Wolf ordered child care centers closed statewide for two weeks as of last Tuesday along with other “nonessential businesses,” though centers that serve the children of workers deemed essential — such as first responders and front-line healthcare workers like nurses — <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/17/Gov-Wolf-orders-child-care-centers-close-waiver-pennsylvania-day-care-COVID-19-coronavirus/stories/202003160149" target="_blank">can apply for waivers to remain open</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, child care advocates Pre-K for PA and Start Strong PA are asking the state to continue to pay the subsidies it would normally pay as part of the Pre-K Counts and Head Start programs, in addition to $17 million to compensate for lost co-pays, $100 million in lost tuition payments from parents, and $50 million to extend programs like Head Start into the summer.</p>
<p>About one-third of the agencies that responded to a survey by the Pennsylvania Child Care Association said they would not be able to reopen if the state-mandated closure lasts beyond a month. That will harm any economic recovery, they said.</p>
<p>“It will be impossible for Pa.'s economy to rebound with one-third less childcare capacity,” said Diane Barber, executive director of the Pennsylvania Child Care Association, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Those centers that are able to operate are also struggling with concerns about safety, additional cleaning and sanitizing, staff having to care for relatives, and concerns about liability, they said.</p>
<p>Samantha Ellwood, executive director of nonprofit child care center Providence Connections, said while the center is closed, her agency is paying its staff, though that can't continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>“That's us dipping into our reserves ... how long can we have to do that?” she said, speaking over the phone while her two-year-old son could be heard exuberantly yelling in the background.</p>
<p>The center on Brighton Road in the North Side serves about 75 kids in its early childhood program.</p>
<p>Ms. Ellwood said she is sensitive to the fact that the ongoing pandemic presents a challenge to businesses, government, and schools, that are all coping with sudden change.</p>
<p>Still, she said, she has a message for elected officials and state leaders.</p>
<p>“Don't forget about child care,” she said.</p>
