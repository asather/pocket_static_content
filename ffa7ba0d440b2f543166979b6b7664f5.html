<h1>PSO, other classical organizations postpone events, suggest donating tickets</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra has canceled or postponed concerts and events through the end of March due to health concerns involving the coronavirus COVID-19.</p>
<p>The events affected are:</p>
<p>BNY Mellon Grand Classics concerts on Friday and Sunday, and March 27 and 29.</p>
<p>PNC Pops “Bugs Bunny at the Symphony” concerts on March 20-22.</p>
<p>EQT Student Side-by-Side concert on Wednesday.</p>
<p>March 24 new subscriber/new donor evening reception.</p>
<p>Other local classical organizations have also canceled or postponed concerts, including Chatham Baroque and Renaissance &amp; Baroque, Chamber Music Pittsburgh, Wheeling Symphony Orchestra, Music in a Great Space, Organ Artists Series in Pittsburgh and Alia Musica Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh Opera has canceled&nbsp;“Carmen” and other events through April 5.</p>
<p>Some organizations around the country are considering live streaming concerts rather than canceling or postponing them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PSO noted in a release that the cancellations will have a significant financial impact and asked that listeners consider ticket exchanges or donating tickets for a tax refund. Other organizations and musicians are making similar pleas on social media. The impact of such cancellations will be particularly felt by freelance artists and those who rely on income per contract.</p>
<p>At the symphony, ticket holders can exchange tickets for future concerts based on availability, bank tickets to use toward another performance, donate the ticket value for tax credit or exchange for a voucher, gift card or refund. The Heinz Hall box office phone number is 412-392-4900.</p>
