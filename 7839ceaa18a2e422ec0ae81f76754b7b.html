<h1>After indictment dismissal reversed, third trial for gun defendant reset for summer</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two federal juries couldn't decide if Raymont Wright was guilty of carrying an illegal gun after an Uptown police chase six years ago, and a third trial has been delayed repeatedly while the parties discuss how to proceed.</p>
<p>Wright, a felon in his 40s from the Hill District, was set for a retrial last month, then in May, and now finally in August, U.S. District Judge Cathy Bissoon ruled Tuesday.</p>
<p>But it might not happen as prosecution and defense "explore a non-trial disposition," according to Wright's public defender.</p>
<p>It's not clear if that means a plea or whether prosecutors, absent any new evidence, will end up dropping the case.</p>
<p>The Wright prosecution has been unusual by any measure.</p>
<p>Nearly all felons charged in federal court with carrying guns end up pleading guilty because the evidence is usually overwhelming. The few who go to trial almost always lose after a day or two of testimony.</p>
<p>But not Wright.</p>
<p>Juries deadlocked twice on his case and Judge Bissoon ruled in 2017 that the government shouldn't get a third try.</p>

<p>At issue was the power of federal judges. Do they have the "inherent authority" to dismiss an indictment? Judge Bissoon said she did, ruling that Wright's "interest in finality" outweighs the government's interest in prosecuting him again.</p>
<p>Two of three circuit judges said she abused her power. In their view, she could dismiss the indictment only if there was evidence of government misconduct, and there wasn't. A third judge dissented, saying she was well within her authority to toss the case after two failures by the U.S. attorney's office to convict.</p>
<p>In December 2014, Wright led police on a chase that started in the Hill. Officers said he drove through a stop sign and took off after spotting an unmarked police car. A pursuit ensued in which he crashed through a fence and into a parking lot where the Civic Arena had previously been.</p>
<p>Police said he got out of the car with a gun in his hand and tried to rack the slide, but then threw the weapon to the ground. Police were unable to recover DNA or fingerprints. So the case boiled down to police testimony, which at least some members of two juries rejected.</p>
<p>Judge Bissoon had said it wasn't fair to put Wright on trial a third time. After the 3rd Circuit decision, Wright asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review his case but in December the justices denied his petition.</p>
<p>His lawyer on Monday asked for another delay. The prosecution did not object, saying lawyers are engaged in "productive discussions that may ultimately obviate the necessity for trial."</p>
<p>If the parties can't reach a deal, however, the U.S. attorney's office said it intends to proceed to trial.</p>
