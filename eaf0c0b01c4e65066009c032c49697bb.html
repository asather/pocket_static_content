<h1>Human testing for new COVID-19 treatment developed by Pitt researchers planned for 2021</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pittsburgh-created medicine to prevent and treat COVID-19 could begin testing in humans in 2021, University of Pittsburgh doctors said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Safety trials of the medicine, dubbed Ab8, will start next year with the hope of getting Food and Drug Administration approval to begin clinical trials, said Dr. John Mellors, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at UPMC and Pitt, the hospital giant’s academic partner.</p>
<p>The medicine — which is not a vaccine — is&nbsp;meant to help protect people who are already infected with COVID-19 from having it spread further in their bodies. It should&nbsp;last “weeks to months,” Dr. Mellors said during a briefing, but added that it was too early to speculate about the cost of the treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an article published Monday in the medical journal Cell, Dr. Mellors and other researchers reported that the antibody they’d identified was effective in neutralizing COVID-19 in mice and hamsters.</p>
<p>COVID-19, which is caused by the new coronavirus, is a highly contagious disease that has killed 930,311 people worldwide as of Tuesday, including 195,047 people in the U.S., according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.</p>
<p>Since the novel coronavirus began raging around the globe, scientists at universities, companies and health organizations have been racing to find ways to combat it. In recent months, developments by different research groups have been announced to great fanfare, although it’s not always clear which promising early findings will make it through testings and gain wider use.</p>
<p>Pitt and UPMC are involved in more than one research push to find ways to attack COVID-19, including participating in coronavirus vaccine trials that are part of a national push to speed the development process. An RNA-based vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. is being tested here, and there are more than 100 other vaccine efforts underway.</p>
<p>The new antibody —&nbsp;which was identified at Pitt from a laboratory library composed of 1 trillion antibodies drawn from volunteer human donors — works by preventing the virus from attaching to human cells, which is necessary for the infection to spread.</p>
<p>The antibody was used to make Ab8, which is not a vaccine that provokes an immune response against cellular invaders, but rather a tiny molecule that can be given to people who are already infected.</p>
<p>That is meant to stop the virus spread inside the body or as a preventive measure to front-line health care workers, nursing home residents and others who are vulnerable or exposed to the disease.</p>
<p>“It’s extremely potent, one of the most potent antibodies described,” Dr. Mellors said, which creates a “very potent blockade of the virus.”</p>
<p>The small size of the antibody — about half the size of a typical antibody — improves the likelihood for deep diffusion into tissues and creates the possibility of alternative administration routes, including inhalation, the researchers said.</p>
<p>Infectious disease specialist Dr. Amesh A. Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who was not involved with the Ab8 study, said an antibody treatment for COVID-19 could complement a vaccine in controlling the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>“Yes, there’s certainly a possibility that it’ll work in humans,” said Dr. Adalja, who is also a native of Butler. “It could be fast-tracked, but it may be months or years” before the medicine is available.</p>
<p>With backing from UPMC, Dr. Mellors and Dimiter Dimitrov, senior author of the Cell article and director of Pitt’s Center for Antibody Therapeutics, co-founded Hill District-based Abound Bio Inc. last year to commercialize human antibodies for therapeutic uses.</p>
<p>In addition to Pitt, Ab8 was evaluated by scientists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, the University of British Columbia and the University of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>At Tuesday’s briefing, Mr. Dimitrov, who was recruited to Pitt in 2017 from the National Cancer Institute, where he was a senior investigator, said identifying the antibody that neutralized the new coronavirus was a “golden moment in the life of a scientist.”</p>
