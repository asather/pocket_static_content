<h1>Rabies is a less of a threat but isn't going anywhere</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As wildlife diseases go, rabies is probably the world’s best known lethal virus. Once feared as a familiar village threat, the pathogen was even linked to mythological foam-mouthed monsters.</p>
<p>Now every hospital can cure infected humans if dealt with quickly, and every veterinarian can vaccinate pets and livestock.</p>
<p>But Joanne Maki, a veterinary scientist with the company that makes a wildlife rabies vaccine, said it would be unwise for people to become too rabies complacent.</p>
<p>“We’ve gotten so good at controlling it, we don’t want people to forget about it,” she said.</p>
<p>Despite advances in the 20th and 21st centuries, rabies isn’t likely to disappear any time soon. Confirmed cases among wild mammals in Allegheny County increased from 15 in 2017 to 25 in 2018 and 2019. To keep a lid on wildlife rabies,&nbsp;the county spends about $23,000 annually to participate in a national wildlife rabies oral vaccination program, said Lori Horowitz, Housing and Community Environment manager at the county health department.</p>
<p>Although the disease can be contracted by a variety of North American mammals, control experience shows that focusing on the wily raccoon is a sound strategy.</p>
<p>“Coyotes, feral cats and other animals are rabies vectors in Pennsylvania. However, the majority of the time they are infected with the raccoon strain of rabies,” said Amy Hess, a U.S. Agriculture Department wildlife biologist. “If we can control rabies in the main vector, we can also control its occurrence in most other species. This is the focus of our National Rabies Management Program in the East, where we have stopped the westward spread of the raccoon rabies strain. Similarly, the canine rabies variant was given attention in 1947 and completely eradicated from the United States in 2004.”</p>
<p>Ms. Maki also touted more recent successes in curbing canine rabies in South Texas, but said she’s not comfortable with the term “eradicate.”</p>
<p>“Eradicate means no detection of the disease. No technology available will allow us to do that,” she said. “Until that time we can be happy with the geographical elimination of rabies. From a public health perspective, that’s the most cost-effective way to deal with it.”</p>
