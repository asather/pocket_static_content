<h1>Police: Two children found unresponsive at Wilkinsburg home making 'great' improvements</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two children who were found unresponsive and removed from a Wilkinsburg home Wednesday morning — one in critical condition —&nbsp;are now doing better, according to Allegheny County police.</p>
<p>Wilkinsburg police were called to a home on Franklin Avenue at 7:35 a.m. after a 5-year-old girl was not responsive. Once there, officers discovered that another child — a 5-year-old boy — had been taken by ambulance to the hospital around 1:45 a.m. when he was found unresponsive.</p>
<p>One of them was in critical condition, police said.</p>
<p>“Both children have made great improvements,” Allegheny County Police Investigations Cmdr. Andrew Schurman said in an emailed statement Thursday.&nbsp;“It is suspected there was some issue with the food.”</p>
<p>Initial concerns of carbon monoxide were eliminated Wednesday as Pittsburgh firefighters investigated.</p>
<p>The commander said they are waiting for additional details from lab reports.</p>
