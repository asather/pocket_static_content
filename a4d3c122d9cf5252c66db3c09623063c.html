<h1>Tom Hanks’ ‘Greyhound’ will open on Apple TV+, not in theaters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tom Hanks was the first major movie star to test positive for COVID-19. Now, the pandemic has altered plans for his upcoming movie release.</p>
<p>"Greyhound," a World War II naval drama filmed aboard the USS Kidd Naval Museum in Baton Rouge, will premiere on Apple TV+ rather than in theaters, the entertainment website Deadline reports. Apple has not set a release date; it had been scheduled to hit theaters Father's Day weekend before the coronavirus closed those venues.</p>
<p>Hanks wrote the script and stars in "Greyhound" as George Krause, an officer given command of a Navy destroyer, the USS Greyhound, soon after the U.S. entered World War II. The story takes place as the Greyhound is escorting a military convoy across the Atlantic Ocean in 1942, when the shipping lanes between America and its European allies were imperiled by German submarines.</p>
<p>Hanks adapted the script from the novel "The Good Shepherd," published in 1955 by C.S. Forester.</p>
