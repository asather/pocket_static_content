<p>The Richard King Mellon Foundation will distribute more than $5 million to help jumpstart the region’s economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Grants to 37 groups include funding for disaster loans, job training, financial counseling and free wifi for underserved communities.</p>

<p>“These projects will lead the way in showing all of us how to reverse the daunting economic impacts of this pandemic,” Sam Reiman, the foundation’s director, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The foundation, the largest philanthropy in the Pittsburgh region, said in April it would earmark $15 million to address the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Besides the allocations announced Monday to spur economic recovery, the foundation has already distributed $3.2 million in emergency operating grants to nonprofits assisting with the COVID-19 crisis and has channeled funds for health care initiatives such as vaccine research and development at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The new economic recovery grants include $250,000 to the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/food/2020/06/22/Downtown-Pittsburgh-Partnerships-reconfigure-streets-restaurants-outdoor-dining-tables-pandemic/stories/202006220055" target="_blank">reconfigure streets</a> for more outdoor dining options and other initiatives as restaurants and other businesses reopen in the Golden Triangle.</p>
<p>Other groups that received the maximum grant amount of $250,000 include the Economic Growth Connection of Westmoreland for a disaster loan fund; the Healthcare Council of Western Pennsylvania for a crisis employee support program; Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre for recovery programming; Community Foundation of Johnstown for the Greater Pittsburgh Farmers Market Network; and Sustainable Pittsburgh for an initiative to adapt the local food chain to better support economic recovery.</p>
<p>After the foundation sought ideas to help the region emerge from the economic fallout of COVID-19, it received 235 submissions that represented 500-plus collaborating organizations.</p>
<p>It selected 80 finalists, and those were asked to submit more details about their proposals.</p>
<p>The 37 grants awarded represent collaborations among 125 groups, the foundation said.</p>
<p>For instance, Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science received a grant of $125,000 to work with partners in Homewood and the New Kensington-Arnold School District to provide free wifi for families and students engaged in remote learning.</p>
<p>Wifi “bubbles” will be located at homes and community centers.</p>
<p>A grant of $50,000 to the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater will allow the arts organization to partner with local businesses in East Liberty to boost commerce and employment.</p>
<p>The R.K. Mellon Foundation’s endowment totaled $2.7 billion at the end of 2019, and last year, it awarded grants totaling $129 million for education, human services, economic development and environmental conservation.</p>
