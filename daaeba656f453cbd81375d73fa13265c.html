<h1>Girls basketball highlights: Washington shocks top-seeded Seton LaSalle</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Washington might not qualify for the WPIAL Class 3A girls playoffs, but the Little Prexies certainly played a spoiler role to perfection Monday night.</p>
<p>Senior point guard Randi Thomas scored a game-high 21 points and Kyla Woods chipped in 15 as Washington (7-13, 5-8) dumped No. 1 Seton LaSalle (14-6, 11-2), 54-50, in overtime to move within a game of Brownsville (11-8, 6-7) for the fourth and final playoff spot in Section 2.</p>
<p>Chloe Lestitian led the Rebels with 17, but it wasnâ€™t enough as Seton LaSalle fell into a first-place tie with South Park (13-7, 11-2). The two teams will meet Thursday at Seton LaSalle to decide the section title.</p>
