<h1>Another Pa. state-owned university shifts to online classes, citing COVID-19 cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Another state-owned campus, Lock Haven University, is shifting its classes online for roughly the next three weeks starting immediately as positive tests for COVID-19 among students increased from 3 to 40, officials said.</p>
<p>Large off-campus gatherings in recent days where students were not wearing masks or social distancing “is the culprit here,’’ said Robert Pignatello, president of the 3,200-student campus&nbsp;about 35 miles northeast of State College.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the second State System of Higher Education campus in the past week to announce suspension of in-person classes, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/08/31/Bloomsburg-University-State-System-of-Higher-Education-Pitt-Penn-State-COVID-19/stories/202008310109" target="_blank">Bloomsburg having announced a similar move last Thursday</a>.&nbsp;That campus as of Monday reported 167 cases, more than triple from a week earlier. Bloomsburg enrolls about 8,700 students.</p>
<p>Both moves come as several Pennsylvania campuses have reported increases in COVID-19 cases based on testing, with some, including Temple University, opting to move temporarily to remote instruction with infections now topping 100.</p>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh, where active cases number 52, and Carnegie Mellon University, with one new case and 10 cumulatively, earlier made pre-emptive decisions last month to start fall classes online.</p>
<p>Lock Haven’s COVID-19 dashboard says the 43 positive results cumulatively out of 891 tests is a positivity rate of 4.82%. Fall semester there began Aug. 24.</p>
<p>“Our initial test results were encouraging. But, as a result of contact tracing and case investigation efforts our testing was ramped up last Friday,” Mr. Pignatello said in a statement late Tuesday. “This situation should demonstrate to everyone the insidious nature of COVID-19, its infectivity, and the critical nature of individual personal responsibility.</p>
<p>“We have determined that off campus gatherings in confined areas where social distancing and mask wearing were not practiced is the culprit here,” he added.</p>
<p>The president said Lock Haven’s asymptomatic testing program worked by “giving us critical information so as to break the chain of infection. Experts say 40% of infection transmission is from individuals with no symptoms.”</p>
<p>The school could resume in-person classes on Sept. 21, officials indicated.</p>
<p>Earlier, on the school’s website, Mr. Pignatello delivered a video message imploring students to act responsibly.</p>
<p>“We have become aware of off-campus gatherings where students are congregating in large numbers, in close quarters, for long periods of time indoors, with no masks and with no social distancing,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Pignatello said the virus is highly contagious, adding, “You can get infected and never even know it but still spread it to others who man get sick, or even if they don’t get sick, can pass it to others who will — other students, your faculty, coaches and staff ...”</p>
<p>Most State System campuses including Western Pennsylvania’s five universities shifted planned fall classes largely online as COVID-19 cases rose this summer in the state and elsewhere.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, Slippery Rock University reported 16 cases, including 13 the past week; Indiana University of Pennsylvania reported three, and&nbsp;California, Clarion and Edinboro reported one each.</p>
<p>State System Chancellor Daniel Greenstein was not immediately available for comment Wednesday. The system has deferred to individual campuses regarding fall plans, saying virus conditions vary and schools know their regions best.</p>
<p>Penn State University, the state’s largest public university, which is not a part of the State System, reported an updated total of 73 COVID-19 cases, 69 of them at University Park.</p>
