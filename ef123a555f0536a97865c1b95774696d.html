<h1>Judge dismisses Heritage Valley Health System lawsuit against software company</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Heritage Valley Health System has lost its initial bid to hold a software company liable for a 2017 malware attack that locked up network computers and caused millions of dollars in damage to the three-hospital network in Beaver and Allegheny counties.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Colville on Aug. 13 dismissed the three-count civil lawsuit that the health system filed in 2019 against Burlington, Mass.-based Nuance Communications Inc. over a 2017 malware attack that seized HVHS operations by blocking access to patient records and files stored on health system hard drives.</p>
<p>Nuance and its wholly owned subsidiary Dictaphone Corp., which&nbsp;Heritage Valley Health System began contracting with in 2003 for on-demand voice transcription services, were explicitly exempted from product liability involving “external parties,” according to the ruling.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, preventing&nbsp;Heritage Valley Health System from amending the complaint. “Needless to say, we are disappointed with the ruling,” the heath system said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>The attack by malware dubbed NotPetya began around 7:30 a.m. June 27,&nbsp;2017, and affected the entire health system, including satellite offices, according to the lawsuit. The damage caused by the attack was “immediate and substantial.”</p>
<p>Heritage Valley Health System&nbsp;claimed that Nuance sacrificed “security protections and governance oversight” for rapid international expansion of the company, which included 50 corporate acquisitions since 2006.</p>
<p>A forensic analysis showed that the malware entered&nbsp;Heritage Valley Health System through a Nuance computer connection in Ukraine, which was the target of the NotPetya Russian military-launched cyberattack.</p>
