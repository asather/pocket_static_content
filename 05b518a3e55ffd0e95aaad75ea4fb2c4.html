<h1>Pittsburgh Fashion Alliance to offer workshops, discounts and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This fall will mark five years since the Downtown Community Development Corp. took the reins of<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/fashion/2019/10/07/Pittsburgh-Fashion-Week-2019-review-Downtown-Community-Development/stories/201910070009" target="_blank"> Pittsburgh Fashion Week</a>. Now it’s unveiled yet another way it plans to promote style in the Steel City.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In partnership with Mayor William Peduto’s office, it’s created the Pittsburgh Fashion Alliance, a group that aims to grow the city’s fashion industry through educational workshops, social events, scholarships and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alliance has been in development for more than a year, says John Valentine, executive director for the DCDC.&nbsp; As of late January, the group’s members total more than 530 people and organizations, including Sephora, Google, Pittsburgh Film Office, Sustainable Pittsburgh and New York Life. There’s no cost to join.</p>
<p>While all members are not directly involved in fashion, there’s a&nbsp;“definite synergy,” Mr. Valentine says. “We feel fashion is a regional asset. If you’re willing to make the fashion community in this city get more exposure, then we welcome you.”</p>
<p>A list of members and their contact information will be published in a directory that Mr. Valentine hopes will be completed before the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/fashion/2019/10/03/Pittsburgh-Fashion-Summit-Peduto-Downtown-Community-Development/stories/201910030040" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Fashion Summit</a>&nbsp;on Feb. 24. It’s a&nbsp;daylong event the DCDC is producing with support from the mayor’s office at the Union Trust Building.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Fashion Alliance plans to make education a key part of its mission. Beginning in September, members will be eligible to sign up for classes in sewing basics, marketing and business development. A scholarship fund is also in the works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another goal is to offer members discounted tickets to fashion shows and reduced rates at partner restaurants and other venues for fashion-related events or meetings.</p>
<p>Mr. Valentine also envisions this alliance as a megaphone for fashion. The DCDC regularly spotlights fashion events and Pittsburgh-based designers in its weekly digital newsletter and in the Pittsburgh Fashion Alert. A podcast is slated to launch this spring.</p>
<p>“We’re going to promote every fashion show in Pittsburgh that would like us to promote them,” he says.&nbsp;</p>
