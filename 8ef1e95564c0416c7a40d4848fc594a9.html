<h1>Bowers' lawyers ask for another delay, claim virus is hindering defense efforts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Lawyers for accused synagogue shooter Robert Bowers want to delay the case because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In a motion filed Monday in U.S. District Court, the defense team says it hasn't been able to meet with Mr. Bowers at the jail in Butler County because of the virus, nor can they interview witnesses or do other work on the case that requires in-person contact.</p>
<p>The lawyers said they intend to ask U.S. District Judge Donetta Ambrose to suspend deadlines for filing more motions and set a status conference for the end of May.</p>
<p>"Adhering to a litigation schedule during this national emergency risks impairing Mr. Bowers’ right to competent counsel in this capital prosecution," wrote public defenders Michael Novara and Elisa Long and private anti-death penalty attorney Judy Clarke of San Diego.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowers is accused of <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/squirrel-hill-massacre-victims/" target="_blank">gunning down 11 worshipers</a> at Tree of Life synagogue in October 2018 and the Justice Department has indicated it will seek to execute him, although no federal inmates have been put to death since 2003.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have repeatedly accused the defense of trying to delay the case and have asked the judge to enforce various deadlines for discovery and trial preparation.</p>
<p>The defense's latest motion is focused solely on COVID-19.</p>
<p>The lawyers say that they are confined to their homes, with Ms. Clarke stuck in California, and haven't met with Mr. Bowers since March 16, three days after the president declared a national emergency. While some preparation can be done remotely, the lawyers say they need to be able to meet in person with their client to assess his comprehension and mental state.</p>
<p>They also cite problems with having to work at home, including technological issues with video conferencing, providing childcare, dealing with older children home from college using up internet resources and living in households with people vulnerable to the virus who need special precautions.</p>
<p>The entire 50-person staff of the public defender's office has been ordered to work from home.</p>
<p>The lawyers say they haven't been able to interview anyone in the Bowers case since March 13, hindering their ability to assemble a life history for him necessary for a death penalty defense. Interviews of family members, for example, need to be done in person because of the emotions involved, the defense says, and not over the phone.</p>
<p>In addition, the lawyers say various records are also difficult to obtain now because many offices are closed.</p>
<p>"The defense team’s attempts to collect relevant life history records are ongoing," the motion says. "However, the COVID-19 emergency has created hurdles that are slowing or even stopping that process."</p>
<p>The lawyers lost a major battle last week when the judge issued a series of rulings rejecting defense arguments that the federal death penalty violates the Constitution. The judge said that it does not and ordered the case to proceed.</p>
<p>The defense is next expected to file new motions seeking dismissal of the indictment.</p>
