<h1>Gas price concerns rise as Pennsylvania considers a regional climate pact for cars</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania state senators on Wednesday raised concerns that a possible multi-state initiative to reduce emissions of climate warming gases from cars and trucks will drive up fuel prices in the commonwealth.</p>
<p>At a <a href="https://environmental.pasenategop.com/012920/" target="_blank">joint hearing</a> of the Senate’s environment and transportation committees, Wolf administration officials said they do not support raising the gas tax in Pennsylvania and they will not decide whether to sign on to the developing climate pact until the program’s design is complete.</p>
<p>Still, leaders of the state’s environment and transportation agencies said they are committed to being part of crafting the program so Pennsylvania’s concerns are reflected in its eventual design.</p>
<p>“Our ongoing participation has been and will remain beneficial for the commonwealth,” said Yassmin Gramian, the acting secretary of the Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>The program, known as the Transportation and Climate Initiative, would cap the amount of carbon dioxide that can be released by vehicles in 11 Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>In its draft form, it would require large fuel terminal owners and aggregators to buy allowances in a new regional market for each ton of carbon dioxide emitted by the gasoline and diesel they sell.</p>
<p>The revenue would be returned to the participating states to invest in making transportation cleaner.</p>
<p>If the auction fees are passed on to drivers, prices for gasoline and diesel could <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/12/23/Transportation-climate-initiative-Pennsylvania-gas-prices-northeast/stories/201912230009" target="_blank">rise between 5 and 17 cents per gallon</a>, according to projections that the Transportation and Climate Initiative released in December.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s not a tax, but the price of gas could go up as a result of the increase of costs to wholesalers,” said Sen. Kim Ward, R-Hempfield, who leads the Senate Transportation Committee.</p>
<p>Ms. Gramian said gas prices are volatile and depend on many other factors that are difficult to anticipate.</p>
<p>Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Patrick McDonnell said the overall cost and benefit of the program will depend on the ultimate design of the model rule — which is still nearly a year away — and whether revenues are invested in ways that drive down transportation costs.</p>
<p>Early projections show the program could provide annual public health benefits worth as much as $10 billion by 2032, he said, including over 1,000 fewer premature deaths and over 1,300 fewer asthma symptoms annually across the region.</p>
<p>“It is not as simple as saying the price will be higher or the price will be lower,” he said.</p>
<p>“It depends very much on that program implementation. Which is why our answer isn’t, ‘We’re absolutely going ahead,’ or, ‘We’re absolutely not.’”</p>
<p>Concerns about the program’s costs to drivers have made other state leaders cool on the initiative. New Hampshire’s governor withdrew from it shortly after the draft agreement was released in December.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/76846fd10289a8f75e51fe50ef75377a" target="_blank">Associated Press reported</a> this week that governors of Vermont and Maine are concerned or “cautious” about the initiative while governors of Virginia and New Jersey were noncommittal.</p>
<p>Ms. Gramian said the Wolf administration is paying close attention to the public debate emerging in other states and Pennsylvania around the initiative, which she called “only one possible approach to address transportation’s relationship to climate change.”</p>
