<h1>PPS to consider starting school year virtually amid rising COVID-19 cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools may move classes fully online for the first quarter of the 2020-21 academic year.</p>
<p>School board member Kevin Carter on Wednesday introduced a resolution that would enforce remote instruction for the first nine weeks of the year in an effort to start school safely amid rising COVID-19 cases in the region and give the district more time to prepare for the return of students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The goal of this resolution is to help structure our focus for the fall given the fact that we keep having more and more positive cases of COVID every day,” Mr. Carter said. “I think this resolution provides both the board and the administration the necessary time to really read out some of the missing details of what in-person in-class instruction will look like.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The school board plans to vote on the resolution at a special legislative meeting Aug. 4. The district will seek public comment on the plan July 29.</p>
<p>Superintendent Anthony Hamlet said district administration had discussed moving the start of the school year online as it tracked the COVID-19 case numbers in the city and region. Allegheny County has exceeded 100 newly reported cases nearly every day in July.</p>
<p>“This is trending upward,” Mr. Hamlet said. “We knew — what we heard previously — that we’d have spikes in the fall. We haven’t even gotten to the fall yet, and we are beginning to see those spikes.”</p>
<p>Mr. Carter’s resolution would require that the district develop a contingency plan for parents of students who are essential workers and those unable to support their child’s remote learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district would also have to create a plan for special education students to receive access to the&nbsp;support services and resources they need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the district would have to ensure that every student has a device for remote instruction.</p>
<p>The district spent the spring and summer acquiring laptops and iPads, and administrators expect to be able to provide all students and staff with a device this school year.&nbsp;Parents whose children do not have a device from the district should call 412-529-4357.</p>
<p>The school board must approve a health and safety plan that the district can send to the state Department of Education before the start of the academic year.</p>
<p>The district built a reopening plan over several weeks this summer using more than 400 recommendations from committees made up of over 300 stakeholders, including administrators, teachers, students and parents.</p>
<p>Under that plan, students could choose one of two options: online only, or&nbsp;a blended model with in-person instruction twice a week and online the other three days.</p>
<p>Students who would attend classes in person would be required to have a symptom screening before coming to school, wear masks throughout most of the school day, and adhere to social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>But several board members signaled support for Mr. Carter’s idea of starting the school year fully online.</p>
<p>Board member Terry Kennedy said the additional nine weeks would give the district time to figure out details and make the necessary arrangements to reopen schools more safely.</p>
<p>Ms. Kennedy said she has heard from parents who are nervous about sending their children back into the classroom and from district employees who are afraid to be in the building but do not want to put their jobs at risk.</p>
<p>“It’s not just staff members who might have a condition that might be at higher risk,” she said.&nbsp;“They might be parents or guardians of other people, or they could be sandwich generation taking care of their parents. There could be any number of reasons, and they’re just worried.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kennedy said she fully supported the resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Board member Pam Harbin echoed Ms. Kennedy, saying, “the decision to start off with remote learning, I think, is the only decision we can make right now to keep everybody safe.</p>
<p>“I would like to say, though, that I do think that the time that we have in the next couple weeks should be used wisely, and it should be used for engagement with our families and with our teachers to really find out what everybody’s needs are,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Board members Sala Udin and Bill Gallagher also hinted at supporting Mr. Carter’s resolution.</p>
<p>Board member Veronica Edwards, however, voiced concerns over the challenges that would be caused by not reopening school for some of the most vulnerable students, such as children experiencing homelessness, special-needs students and English-language learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There is&nbsp;no plan in this world that is going to work for all families, but we still have all families to provide for,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter replied by saying that going remote was not ideal, but public health outweighs the importance of getting students back into the classroom.</p>
<p>“I think the only irresponsible thing for us to do is to put kids in school buildings — that’s irresponsible,” he said. “Especially when all the details of what that looks like are not fully ironed out.”</p>
