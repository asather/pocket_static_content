<h1>Masks required for employees and customers, new Pa. health department order states</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Customers and employees at businesses that are still operating will now be required to wear masks, according to <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/456575241/20200415-SOH-Worker-Safety-Order" target="_blank">a new order from Dr. Rachel Levine,</a> secretary of the state Department of Health.</p>
<p>The order, which goes into effect immediately and will be enforced starting Sunday at 8 p.m., outlined protections for critical workers who are working at essential and life-sustaining businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>It laid out guidelines for helping employees maintain a social distance during work, mitigation and cleaning protocols for businesses that remain open and details on how a business should respond if it has been exposed to a case of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Among many stipulations, employers must require employees to wear masks while at the work site. Customers must do so while on the premises.</p>
<p>A business must deny entry to individuals not wearing masks, unless the company is providing medication, medical supplies or food. In those cases, the business must offer alternative options, like pick-up or delivery of goods.</p>
<p>Individuals who cannot wear a mask due to a medical condition, including children under the age of two years, may enter the premises without having to provide medical documentation, the press release announcing the order stated.</p>
<p>For employees, companies must either provide the coverings or approve a mask obtained or made by workers. Employees do not have to use the mask during a break to eat or drink.</p>
<p>“This order provides critical protections for the workers needed to run and operate these life-sustaining establishments," Gov. Tom Wolf said in a prepared statement. "Businesses across the state have already begun to implement many of these protocols on their own, and we applaud their efforts to protect employees and customers."</p>
<p>Businesses that do not comply could face citations, fines or license suspensions, according to the release.</p>
<p>The requirements will be enforced by the Pennsylvania State Police, Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, Department of Health, Department of Agriculture, Department of Labor and Industry, and local officials, using resources to enforce closure orders within their jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“This order will ensure continuity across all life-sustaining businesses and will further our efforts to protect the health and safety of all Pennsylvanians," Dr. Levine said in a prepared statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the new orders, employers must also:</p>
<p>Upon discovery of an exposure to a person who is a probable or confirmed case of COVID-19, businesses must implement temperature screenings before employees enter for the start of work, the order states. Employees must send anyone home who has a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.</p>
<p>Upon an exposure, businesses are also ordered to:</p>
<p>Businesses that serve the public within a building or defined area are ordered to implement the following, based on the size of the building and number of employees:</p>
