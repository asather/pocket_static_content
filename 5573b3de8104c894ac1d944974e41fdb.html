<h1>Pitt picks up fourth 2021 recruit: Virginia linebacker Trevion Stevenson</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>College football programs are prohibited from hosting high school prospects due to the spread of COVID-19. But Pat Narduzzi and Pitt’s coaching staff are still recruiting remotely — and their persistence was rewarded Wednesday.</p>
<p>Trevion Stevenson, a 2021 defensive prospect from Phoebus High School (Hampton, Va.), verbally committed to the Panthers without ever visiting campus. Stevenson is a two-star prospect on Rivals and a three-star recruit according to 247 Sports.</p>
<p>Stevenson, who might play either linebacker or defensive end at the next level, is the fourth member of Pitt’s 2021 class. He joins four-star West Mifflin defensive end Nahki Johnson, three-star Imhotep Charter (Philadelphia) defensive back Javon McIntyre and fellow Virginia native and three-star tailback Rodney Hammond.</p>
<p>Stevenson was previously committed to Old Dominion before re-opening his recruitment in the winter. The 6-5 prospect’s offer sheet grew in March, with scholarship interest from Tennessee, Texas, Michigan and Penn State, according to 247 Sports. Earlier this month, he picked up offers from Florida State, TCU, Mississippi State and West Virginia. Pitt offered last Monday, which he accepted Wednesday.</p>
<p>Stevenson became Pitt’s first verbal commitment of the COVID-19 era, but he likely won’t be the last. With Pitt’s prospect camps this summer already canceled, Narduzzi and his staff have to accept virtual tours, texts, calls and even playing “Madden” with recruits as the only means of communication, at least for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>On March 13, a day after the NCAA basketball tournaments were canceled, the college sports governing body announced a recruiting “dead” period through at least April 15. On April 1, that was extended through May 31.</p>
<p>Still, Pitt will pursue more prospects to join Stevenson in the 2021 class, including a few local standouts. Four-star Gateway safety Derrick Davis, four-star Central Catholic defensive tackle Elliot Donald, three-star Baldwin pass-rusher Dorien Ford and three-star Peters Township safety Donovan McMillon remain uncommitted.</p>
<p>“This is as good of a class that has been intact in this state of Pennsylvania since I’ve been here,” Narduzzi said two weeks ago on a Zoom conference call. “This year is a heck of a year in the state of Pennsylvania.”</p>
