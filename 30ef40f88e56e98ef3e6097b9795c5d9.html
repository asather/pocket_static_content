<h1>PETA: It's time for Robo Phil</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In a statement released by PETA just a&nbsp;few days ahead of Groundhog Day, the animal-right’s group urged the state’s Punxsutawney&nbsp;Groundhog Club to&nbsp;release its groundhogs to a “reputable sanctuary,” and begin using an animatronic one instead that would predict weather using artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Established in 1887, the Groundhog Club, located in Punxsutawney, Pa., has supported the popular tradition of Groundhog Day annually on Feb. 2 since just before their institution. The day begins early, and is filled with a large gathering — comprised of cameras, booze and people from all over — who have come to celebrate and witness the occasion centered around a weather-forecasting woodchuck named Phil.</p>
<p>“It’s long overdue for Phil to be retired,” said PETA president&nbsp;Ingrid Newkirk in an online statement released Tuesday.&nbsp;“As a prey species, groundhogs actively avoid humans. Being in close proximity to the public causes these animals great stress.”</p>
<p>Legend of the furry phenom whose supposed fear of his own shadow leads to dubious weather predictions, is the center of the longstanding tradition.&nbsp;If he sees his shadow when handlers pull him from his hole during the early and often cold morning hours of Feb. 2, Phil will crawl back inside and there will be six more weeks of bad weather.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, it’s a sign of spring and he stays above ground.</p>
<p>But PETA leaders say the excitement and noise of the day may be too much for the shy whistle pig.&nbsp;“It’s no kind of life for these animals,” Ms. Newkirk said in her statement.</p>
<p>“When Phil is dragged out of his hole and held up to flashing lights and crowds, he has no idea what’s happening,” she said. “Being relegated to a library ‘habitat’ for the other days of the year doesn’t allow him or the other groundhogs there to dig, burrow, or forage.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>PETA offered collaboration and said they could recommend a sanctuary for the groundhogs. Ms. Newkirk said&nbsp;using animatronics instead of live animals would create an “AI Phil” groundhog with artificial intelligence who could&nbsp;“actually” predict the weather.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman who answered a number listed for the Groundhog Club in Punxsutawney declined to comment on PETA’s statement, but said,&nbsp; “We are just excited as always and we’re getting ready for Groundhog day.” The occasion will begin Sunday just after 7 a.m. at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney.</p>
