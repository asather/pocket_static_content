<h1>Derek Holland on signing with Pirates: ‘It’s time to redeem myself’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Derek Holland has seen the numbers. And the same as pretty much everyone else, he’s hardly OK with the 6.08 ERA, 1.51 WHIP and minus-1.2 WAR that he produced in 84 1/3 innings with the Giants and Cubs last season. But Holland also has a benefit that many of us do not: context.</p>
<p>Things such as the inability to climb back in counts because he couldn’t locate his slider as well as he wanted to. Or having to rely more on his sinker, which too often he left in the fat part of the strike zone.</p>
<p>Not great … but certainly fixable.</p>
<p>“There were a lot of positives that I saw, too,” Holland told the Post-Gazette by phone on Tuesday afternoon. “Even if the numbers don’t necessarily show them.”</p>
<p>That’s what the Pirates are hoping for, anyway. They signed Holland to a minor-league deal late last week, one that includes an invitation to spring training, because they’re betting he’s better than what he showed last season. For Holland to stick, he’ll have to pitch more like the guy who had a 3.57 ERA with a 1.29 WHIP and a career-high 169 strikeouts for the Giants in 2018.</p>
<p>The Pirates are giving Holland a chance to compete for a spot in the starting rotation, although he said they’ve also told him he’d get a chance in the bullpen, too.</p>
<p>It’s the quintessential prove-it deal for a 33-year-old who was drafted in the 25th round back in 2006, a left-hander who has pitched for four teams over 11 seasons in the major leagues.</p>
<p>“I know there are probably a lot of people who doubt me because of how bad the year was last year,” Holland said. “I like that. I want people to bet against me. I feel very happy with where I am and what I need to do to get myself back on track.”</p>
<p>One interesting thing with Holland involves Oscar Marin, the Pirates’ new pitching coach. The two spent significant time together with the Texas Rangers organization.</p>
<p>Though Marin wasn’t with the major league club when Holland was there — the lefty went 40-21 with a 3.83 ERA in 100 games (97 starts) from 2011-14 — he was familiar with Holland and how he was able to get outs.</p>
<p>Holland said he and Marin have already chatted on the phone, and they figure to do more talking in the coming days as Holland will report early to Pirate City.</p>
<p>“I feel like it’s a great opportunity for me,” Holland said. “Oscar and I have a good relationship. It was awesome to talk to him on the phone, catch up and get back to where we were. He helped me get back on track with my career after [knee, shoulder and finger] injuries. I think he’s played a big part of helping me get to where I needed to be. It’s definitely good to be able to reconnect with him again.”</p>
<p>Devising a game plan for Holland should not be terribly difficult. His slider is terrific, generating a whiff rate of at least 34.9 percent every year he’s been in the majors. Last year that number was 41.6, though its put-away percentage was a career-low 15.6 percent, the desired command lacking.</p>
<p>Holland also prefers to pitch inside, which he didn’t do as effectively as he would have liked last season.</p>
<p>If Holland can get that stuff in order, his velocity was more than serviceable in 2019; his sinker averaged 92.4 mph, its best such mark in four years.</p>
<p>“I know that I got a lot of my velocity back,” Holland said. “My last start I was topping out at 96 mph, sitting 94-95. It’s there. It’s just a matter of getting it there and staying there.”</p>
<p>Another thing that happened to Holland in 2019: his curveball usage basically disappeared. After throwing that pitch 12.5 percent of the time in 2018, Holland used it 4.3 percent in 2019 — probably in part because hitters slugged .875 on it.</p>
<p>While Holland’s slider will always be his bread and butter, his best seasons have traditionally featured more curveballs; in 2011, when Holland went 16-5 and pitched to a 3.95 ERA with 162 strikeouts and four complete games, he threw his curve 11.2 percent of the time.</p>
<p>“When things aren’t going well, most of the time it’s execution and location, missing over the middle of the plate and not getting your pitches where they should be,” Holland said.</p>
<p>“In 2018, I could get away with pitching behind in counts because I could throw my off-speed for strikes. Last year, I had to throw fastballs. Everybody also knows I love to pitch inside. If you stay inside too long and you don’t give them anything away, you’re setting yourself up for failure.”</p>
<p>What Holland does in spring training should be fascinating to watch. Somewhere in there could be the pitcher who went 8 1/3 scoreless while allowing just two hits in Game 4 of the 2011 World Series, the same guy who has held lefties to a .234 average and .622 OPS throughout his career.</p>
<p>But Holland also had a disaster of a season last year, when a mere eight of his 51 appearances came in the form of starts, the last one of those lasting just two innings with Holland allowing seven earned runs.</p>
<p>“It’s time to redeem myself,” Holland said. “I was not happy with the way that my season ended. As a bullpen guy, I thought I did a lot better than the numbers. I also know people look at that very last start against St. Louis, when I got my butt kicked.</p>
<p>“But having this opportunity, I can get back on track. I know I have a lot left in the tank. I’m looking to write a new chapter in my career.”</p>
