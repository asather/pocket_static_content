<h1>Pittsburgh City League opts out of PIAA football playoffs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The City League has had little success in the PIAA football playoffs in recent years. But City League teams will have no chance for success in the state playoffs this year.</p>
<p>They won’t be competing.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools has decided City League football teams will not participate in the PIAA playoffs. City League officials informed the PIAA of its decision recently and the PIAA modified its postseason brackets and released them Wednesday during a PIAA board of directors meeting.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools was going to cancel all fall sports because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the board of education changed its mind in late August. The six football-playing schools in the City League started playing games Sept. 25. University Prep, Westinghouse, Brashear, Perry and Allderdice are playing a City League schedule, while Carrick is playing as an independent.</p>
<p>The City League is 3-17 in PIAA playoff games over the past seven years, but Westinghouse won a PIAA game last year and in 2018. The City League hasn’t had a team get out of sub-regional play since University Prep won two games and made it the Class 3A first round in 2012.</p>
<p>Donta Green, coach at defending City League champion Westinghouse, said the reason the City League pulled out of the PIAA playoffs is because the City schedule would not have been finished in time for teams to participate in the PIAA playoffs.&nbsp;Now, with the decision to opt out of the PIAA football playoffs, the City League season will end with the City championship game either Nov. 6-7.</p>
<p>“We had a meeting before the season with (City League athletic director) Karen Arnold and most of the coaches wanted to focus on the City League only schedule,” Green said.&nbsp;“We wouldn’t be done in time for the PIAA playoffs. How do I feel about it? It sucks because I know the next level our program wants to get to is the state playoffs. Right now, our kids love the City League, but what we’re preaching is state playoffs. But we have a young team and hopefully we’ll have the state playoffs the next two years.”</p>
<p>But the City League (District 8) isn’t the only district that decided to opt out of the PIAA football playoffs. District 11 (Allentown area) also voted recently to not participate because the district’s playoffs would not be concluded in time to send teams to the PIAA playoffs. District 11 has two teams in the Post-Gazette state rankings — East Stroudsburg in Class 5A and Allentown Central Catholic in Class 4A.</p>
<p>As for the City League, there was a time when City teams were very competitive in the PIAA playoffs. Oliver, which no longer exists, was the last City team to make it to the PIAA quarterfinals in 2006, losing to eventual Class 3A champion General McLane, 14-6.</p>
<p>Perry made it to the PIAA quarterfinals three consecutive years (2003-05) and to the semifinals in 1999, 2001 and 2002. Perry’s 2002 team had not allowed a point all season until losing to Hopewell, 20-3, in the semifinals.</p>
<p>Perry is the only City League team to make a PIAA championship. The Commodores shocked the world of Pennsylvania football when they knocked off mighty Berwick for the 1989 PIAA Class 3A title. In 1997, Perry, led by quarterback Rod Rutherford, lost in the Class 3A championship to Berwick.</p>
<p><strong>Forfeits for playoffs</strong></p>
<p>The PIAA clarified its stance on postseason games that might be called off because of COVID-19. If a team can’t play a postseason game because of COVID-19, it must forfeit the contest. This applies to PIAA and district playoff games, including the WPIAL.</p>
<p>The WPIAL football committee met Tuesday to come up with a plan of how to deal with postponed regular season games that would affect playoff qualifiers. WPIAL executive director Amy Scheuneman said the committee’s recommendation must be approved by the WPIAL board of directors at a meeting Oct. 14.</p>
<p><strong>Other PIAA matters</strong></p>
<p>• The PIAA approved a proposal that allows teams to continue playing games until Thanksgiving if they want to reach the PIAA maximum regular season limit of 10 games. This new rule applies to teams that might win or lost in the postseason.</p>
<p>How would it affect the WPIAL? Well, WPIAL teams were scheduled for seven regular season games. A team could lose a playoff game but then play two more games to reach the maximum of 10. The purpose of this rule was to allow teams to continue playing if they only had, say, five regular season games.</p>
<p>• The PIAA approved new fall sports playoff brackets recently but changed them after District 12 (Philadelphia Catholic League) elected to play fall sports after all, and because of District 11 and the City League opting out of the football playoffs.</p>
<p>• Football teams that don’t participate in fall sports this year because of COVID-19 can play a spring schedule that can include as many as seven games. But there will be no PIAA playoffs in the spring.</p>
<p>• The PIAA changed the number of individual qualifiers that will make the PIAA cross country championship meet. Originally, only the district championship team and the top five individuals not on the team would qualify for the PIAA meet. But the PIAA will take seven individuals from the WPIAL in Class 1A and 2A boys and girls, and 10 individuals in Class 3A boys and girls.</p>
<p>• PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi said winter sports are scheduled to start on time right now. The first practice date is Nov. 20 and the first play date Dec. 11 for basketball, wrestling and swimming.</p>
<p>• The PIAA had an eligibility appeal hearing Wednesday with North Allegheny junior football-basketball player Kyrell Hutcherson, who had been ruled by the WPIAL as eligible for football but ineligible for basketball this year. The WPIAL made its ruling because it alleged Hutcherson transferred from Kiski Area for basketball reasons. The PIAA overturned the WPIAL’s ruling after some new evidence was presented by North Allegheny. While Hutcherson is eligible for both football and basketball at North Allegheny, the PIAA made him ineligible for the postseason in both sports.</p>
