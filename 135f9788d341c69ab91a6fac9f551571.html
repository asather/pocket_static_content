<h1>Lawrenceville's Row House Cinema will open online as streaming portal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Row House Cinema — the Lawrenceville movie theater known for arthouse fare, festivals and special events —&nbsp;is closed to customers coming in, but that won't stop it from bringing new movies to you.</p>
<p>Films that were to open there as Pittsburgh in-theater premieres already may be available through streaming services. But by buying a ticket through Row House, the cinema receives 50% of all ticket sales, “which will be an amazing way to help us — and our employees — survive while being shut down,” owner Brian Mendelssohn said.</p>
<p>Starting Saturday afternoon, tickets can be purchased at <a href="https://rowhousecinema.com/" target="_blank">the Row House website</a> for $12, and movies "can be seen on any computer, Roku, AppleTV, etc.," Mr. Mendelssohn said.</p>
<p>Row House is among the movie theaters nationwide partnering with distributors such as At House Convergence and the service Film Movement Plus to stream current releases digitally.</p>
<p>"These films were supposed to be released in theaters over the next couple of months, mostly arthouse titles,” Mendelssohn said. ”The process [for audiences] will be to start on our website, rowhousecinema.com, [where] we will have two ‘screens’ each week."</p>

<p>The first two movies available this way are "Corpus Christi," the Oscar-nominated film from Poland about a criminal who has a spiritual transformation, and "The Wild Goose Lake," a noir crime thriller from China.&nbsp;</p>
