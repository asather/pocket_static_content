<h1>Former Butler DA's detective pleads guilty in $1.3 million hospital theft</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The husband half of a husband-and-wife team accused of stealing $1.3 million from Butler Health System for their personal use and other financial crimes admitted his guilt Thursday, a day after his wife did the same.</p>
<p>Scott Roskovski, 51, a former Butler County district attorney's detective, pleaded guilty to a count of filing a false income tax return and a count of submitting a false loan application to a bank.</p>
<p>His wife, Stephanie Roskovski, former chief operating officer at the hospital system, pleaded guilty Wednesday to mail fraud and filing a false return.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said the Roskovskisâ€™ crimes "truly shock the conscience," especially since both were in positions of power. Stephanie controlled the finances at the hospital and Scott handled financial crimes for the DA.</p>
<p>"Instead of $1.3 million being available to Butler hospital for patient care, the Roskovskis used the embezzled money for their own personal spending spree, with lavish vacations, home renovations and even a 70-acre motocross business," Mr. Brady said. "Once trusted employees, today they are convicted felons."</p>
<p>From April 2011 through December 2017, Stephanie Roskovski embezzled the money by using her corporate credit card for personal expenses that she disguised as business expenses, submitted false reimbursement requests and obtained hundreds of merchant gift cards by claiming they were for business purposes.</p>
<p>During that time, Scott Roskovski was investigating fraud and theft cases for the DA.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the pair spent most of the money on vacations, home renovations and the purchase and operation of Switchback MX, their motocross track in Butler County.</p>
<p>In addition to the thefts, the couple didn't report the stolen money on their income tax returns. After they were fired from their jobs, they submitted false loan applications to S&amp;T Bank to refinance the motocross and to buy a bulldozer.</p>
<p>The bank extended two loans, $1.1 million for the motocross track and $55,000 for the bulldozer, based on the false information.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Stickman said he will sentence Stephanie Roskovski on Oct. 5 and Scott on Oct. 6.</p>
