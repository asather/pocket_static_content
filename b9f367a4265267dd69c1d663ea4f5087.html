<h1>Pitt gives students option to forgo letter grades</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh on Friday joined <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/19/pass-fail-grading-satisfactory-Penn-State-Carnegie-Mellon-COVID19-university-online-remote/stories/202003190117" target="_blank">other universities </a>in saying students will have the option of forgoing letter grades this semester, given the upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that has emptied Pitt’s five campuses and required a switch to remote instruction.</p>
<p>Provost Ann Cudd <a href="https://www.provost.pitt.edu/news/all-faculty-members-mar20" target="_blank">outlined the changes </a>in a message to faculty.</p>
<p>“After the conclusion of this term, all undergraduate and graduate students will be permitted to convert any of their courses during this spring term from a letter grade basis to a satisfactory (S) or no credit (NC),” she wrote.</p>
<p>“Moreover, all courses that are awarded S grades will count toward graduation or degree requirements and satisfy future course prerequisites, while those courses awarded NC grades will not negatively impact a student's GPA.”</p>
<p>Pitt has 34,000 students on its main Oakland campus and branches in Bradford, Johnstown, Greensburg and Titusville.</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon this week said its students <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/19/pass-fail-grading-satisfactory-Penn-State-Carnegie-Mellon-COVID19-university-online-remote/stories/202003190117" target="_blank">now have the option of switching to pass/ fail.</a> Penn State University is weighing a recommendation from its Faculty Senate to allow some courses to be transitioned to satisfactory/unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>The moves come as professors and students on campuses in Pennsylvania and the nation adapt to a new reality of online and other remote instruction to slow the spread of the sometimes deadly virus.</p>
<p>Face-to-face instruction has been suspended on Pittsburgh-area campuses and elsewhere, and both Pitt and Carnegie Mellon announced this week plans to drastically reduce their operations.</p>
<p>Pitt earlier this week postponed commencement, as did Penn State.</p>
<p>The message from Ms. Cudd touched on a variety of topics from tenure extensions for faculty to plans for summer programming.</p>
