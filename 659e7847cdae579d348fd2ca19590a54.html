<p>SANTA CLARITA, Calif. — An ex-girlfriend of boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. who was the mother of three of his children was found dead in a Southern California suburb, authorities said.</p>
<p>The coroner’s office confirmed Wednesday that the woman was Josie Harris, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told KABC-TV.</p>
<p>The woman was found just before 10 p.m. Tuesday PST in a vehicle parked in the driveway of her apparent residence just outside the city of Santa Clarita and firefighters pronounced her dead, a sheriff’s department statement said.</p>
<p>Sheriff’s investigators and the coroner’s office were working to determine the cause of death, Mr. Villanueva said.</p>
<p>“It will take a while to figure that out,” he said.</p>
<p>In 2010, Ms. Harris alleged that Mr. Mayweather attacked her in Las Vegas. The following year he pleaded guilty to a reduced misdemeanor charge and served two months in jail.</p>
<p>In 2015, Ms. Harris sued Mr. Mayweather for defamation and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress in response to statements he made about the incident during an interview.</p>
<p>During his response to questions about domestic violence, Mr. Mayweather said: “Did I kick, stomp, and beat someone? No, that didn’t happen. I look in your face and say, ‘No, that didn’t happen.‘ Did I restrain a woman that was on drugs? Yes, I did. So if they say that’s domestic violence, then you know what? ... I’m guilty of restraining a person.”</p>
<p>In 2018, a California appeals court ruled against Mr. Mayweather’s objections and allowed the lawsuit to proceed.</p>
