<h1>Continuing the mission: Regional Meals On Wheels, food banks adjust but persist during virus outbreak</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the head chef at McKnight Meals on Wheels in Ross Township, Bob Montgomery has been dedicated to his mission for the last decade — feed the clients.</p>
<p>That hasn’t wavered, especially since the program serves primarily home bound senior citizens who are unable to shop for food or cook for themselves. And as the new coronavirus, COVID-19, is known to have worse effects on older adults and people with severe medical conditions, Mr. Montgomery knows his services are needed now more than ever.</p>
<p>“We have to keep going. Someone’s got to feed these people,” Mr. Montgomery told the Post-Gazette last week. “They’re a delicate group... I have to keep sending them meals. They wouldn’t survive, otherwise.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chef and his group of nearly 80 volunteers who work out of Berkeley Hill Lutheran Church —&nbsp;which has canceled all other programs and services —&nbsp;have continued on business as usual, even while the virus continues to cause panic and disruption, and health officials confirm more positive cases of COVID-19 in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Staff members have always taken extra precaution when it comes to sanitizing surfaces and washing their hands, Mr. Montgomery said, but one key aspect of their delivery method has had to change in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>“The big part of Meals on Wheels is interacting with the clients, but I told the drivers they should not enter the home,” he said. “No shaking hands. No contact. So they’ve been handing the food to them at the door and returning to their cars. We are doing everything we can to keep our clientele safe.”</p>
<p>Black Hawk Area Meals on Wheels in Beaver County is operating under similar sentiments.</p>
<p>Wilma Uebelecker, who started the program in 2013 after working with Lutheran Service Society of Western Pennsylvania for nearly 20 years, knows first-hand the affect the virus outbreak is having on the senior citizen population.</p>
<p>Ms. Uebelecker is 89 years old and her husband is 92. The couple have both been “ordered” by their daughter to stay inside, mirroring guidelines handed down from government officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>But although she is self-quarantining, Ms. Uebelecker said her group of 60 volunteers, that include her daughter and son-in-law, are keeping the ball rolling to serve the elderly across nine different towns.</p>
<p>“It’s very important now because these people don’t have a way to get out. These people don’t cook for themselves and a lot of them, they don’t have children that live around here to help them like I do,” Ms. Uebelecker said.</p>
<p>After the virus outbreak, her program stopped accepting outside donations of food that already have been prepared, like cakes and desserts. Other than that, the clients are still being fed a hot meal and a bagged lunch five days-a-week.</p>
<p>As for major food banks in the region, pantry operators have had to adjust a bit more to the circumstances surrounding COVID-19.</p>
<p>Community Food Warehouse of Mercer County is faced with constant changes in strategy to ensure those in need have access to food, as information surrounding the virus continues to evolve.</p>
<p>“We are just taking it day-by-day, moment-by-moment like everybody else,” said Mimi Prada, Agency Manager and spokesperson for the warehouse. “It’s all a work in progress. Literally hour-by-hour, things change.”</p>
<p>Of the 33 agencies that fall under Community Food Warehouse, 14 of them are dedicated food pantries across Mercer County and 18% of clientele are senior citizens. But most volunteers fall under the high-risk age category, and Ms. Prada said they have asked that group to stay home.</p>
<p>Fortunately, younger citizens have stepped up to lend a hand during the outbreak, while pantries convert to packing to-go boxes instead of having visitors come into sites and shop around.</p>
<p>“We have had an influx of calls in recent weeks of people asking ‘How can I help?’,” Ms. Prada said. “So fortunately, we don’t have a shortage of volunteers at this point.”</p>
<p>Greater Washington County Food Bank has also had help from younger volunteers, particularly college students who are currently on break from in-class instruction due to the outbreak.</p>
<p>Executive Director Connie Burd said most of her volunteers fall under the high-risk age range, and some of the&nbsp;“regulars” aren’t leaving their homes during this time. The program is looking for areas in which it can sacrifice certain resources in order to devote more efforts towards packing boxes for its 49 pantries and adjusting delivery methods to limit physical contact.</p>
<p>“If pantry coordinators are unable to work for any reason, we are looking to do a truck-load model. So trying to get boxes from our trucks to cars instead of having [shoppers] come inside.”</p>
<p>For the two-person staff at Corner Cupboard Food Bank in Greene County, relying on volunteers is essential as director Candace Webster said her program doesn’t have the ability to deliver food to each pantry, and certainly cannot deliver to families who are choosing to stay home. But ultimately, the food bank wanted to be sure everyone felt comfortable continuing on with their services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When this all started, we had a conversation with our pantry workers and got a sense of if they were comfortable enough to be there on the front lines,” she said. “We asked if they would they rather take the boxes [of food] out to cars, and discussed how we can limit the number of people at the site.”</p>
<p>Corner Cupboard works closely with the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, which has been updating its policies and responses to the coronavirus outbreak <a href="https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/2020/03/12/coronavirus/" target="_blank">on its website</a> over the last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The organization that helps to distribute food across 11 Southwestern Pennsylvanian counties and served over 131,400 seniors through the&nbsp;pantry network in the 2018-2019 fiscal year&nbsp;began implementing drive-thru public distributions March 16 to limit person-to-person contact and adhere to social distancing recommendations, according to&nbsp;Brian Gulish,&nbsp;Vice President of Marketing and Communications. Mr. Guilsh said they have encouraged high-risk citizens who are self-isolating to send proxies in their place to pick up food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At yesterday's Foodshare distribution here at the Food Bank, the vast majority of cars were also picking up orders for friends or neighbors who couldn't get out of their house easily or were choosing not to,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stakes are slightly higher in Allegheny County where the Health Department has confirmed 28 cases of COVID-19 infection as of Friday, where as Westmoreland County has reported 4 cases as of Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for Jennifer Miller, CEO of Westmoreland County Food Bank, her duties still have a great impact on her community as grocery store shelves are clearing out and access to food becomes more and more difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Miller is asking volunteers to deliver to senior citizens homes if necessary, and employing the drive-up method for those that come to distribution sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I had one lady come up to me and say, ‘Thank you for being here because I went to the store and I was only able to get a quarter of what I really needed’,” Ms. Miller said who has been working in food banking for the last 30 years. “[The woman] said, ‘If it wasn’t for you, there would be no food in my house right now.”</p>
