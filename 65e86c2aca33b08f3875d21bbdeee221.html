<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 03.09.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Good afternoon, friends. Big news this morning in the NFL: Giants tight end Rhett Ellison has retired. If it’s not too much trouble, it might be nice for all of you to share your favorite Rhett Ellison memories from over the years. In the meantime, let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: With the window with Ben closing, would you trade ‘21 1st rounder for one this draft? Minkah’s trade sure worked out well/ <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No. 1, I’m not sure a whole lot of teams would be willing to do that. Trading for a 2021 first-rounder is pretty far off and there’s a lot of uncertainty/unpredictability in doing that. And No. 2, I’m not sure there’s a clear enough hole/need for the Steelers next season to justify that. Unless you’re thinking ‘OK, we’ll let Bud Dupree walk, and draft a can’t-miss edge-rusher in the first.’ But even that isn’t exactly a foolproof plan.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: When can we expect to see the Steelers moves to create more cap space? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well, the Steelers - and other teams - are still in something of a holding pattern given the pending vote on the CBA proposal. Players have until Friday to say yay or nay, and once that passes - or doesn’t? - you should see a bevy of moves around the league. But one thing we know for sure is that the franchise tag deadline is Thursday. You’ll at least have a definite answer on Bud Dupree by then, even if all signs are pointing toward the tag and have been for a while now.</p>
<p><strong>Jake</strong>: Brian, Ben has not got us back to SB since 2009 but yet other than beating Miami and the Bungles no play off wins of note. I say that window has close with lesser talent around him. Better start getting ready for life after Ben. How do you see it? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I disagree. Sure, Ben Roethlisberger might not be quite good enough anymore to carry a cast of less-than-stellar pieces to a Lombardi Trophy, but that’s a big reason why you’re seeing the Steelers invest high-ish picks on those positions and why most expect them to do so again this draft. Life after Ben will be very touch-and-go, as it is for most franchises when they replace a two-time Super Bowl-winning veteran QB, so you can hardly bank on that being an easy transition.</p>
<p><strong>Louis</strong>: Brian not because replacing Edmunds or anything, I still think he will improve still very young but don’t you think if Winfield Jr (he has everything) is sitting there at 49 which most likely won’t, if he is though, and is BPA all across don’t you think he would be a no brainer, and get offense later, we need depth at safety anyway and we could do so many things with him, edmunds and Minkah.. thoughts <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nah, can’t do it. I like Antoine Winfield Jr. as a prospect - he stood out to me in Minnesota’s win over Penn State, for sure - and always kind of liked his dad too for some reason, but the Steelers just don’t have enough of a need there. You could MAYBE persuade me to take a really good edge-rusher or even inside linebacker at 49 overall, but that’s about it for the defensive side of the ball.</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Brian, thanks for the chats! I enjoyed your article about small school TEs. If you were GM and no TEs had been selected yet, would you draft Trautman or Harrison Bryant? Or would you rather have someone from a bigger college like Kmet or Okwuegbunum? Thanks! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Appreciate it, Dad - I mean, Nate. Interested parties can check that out here ... <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/09/Adam-Trautman-Dayton-NFL-tight-end-prospects-Harrison-Bryant/stories/202003060120" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/09/Adam-Trautman-...</a> <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: In that scenario, I’d probably go with Cole Kmet from Notre Dame. It just seems like he has one or two fewer questions surrounding him than the smaller-school guys. Side note: Florida Atlantic really isn’t a small school at all, it actually has a pretty high enrollment down there in Boca Raton, but hey, colloquialisms and the NFL draft, am I right? And I’d never root against a guy for my own personal convenience, but please, Steelers, think long and hard before taking Albert Okwuegbunam.</p>
<p><strong>CincySteelerfan</strong>: Brian, thanks for the chat. Everyone is talking TE but the FA’s are too much money. I say we should resign Nick Vannett since he likes the culture and see what Ben can do with him. Then if we need to add, watch for cap casualties. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Maybe if he’ll sign for the vet minimum. I’m with you on the TE market. Probably going to be too steep for the Steelers to go after the big names. That’s pretty much why I’ve been advocating for drafting one. And yes, keeping an eye on some intriguing names that will shake loose between now and September is also a must. Not sure the Steelers did a great job of that at that position in 2019. Hence, you trade a mid-round draft pick for potentially 13 games of Nick Vannett.</p>

<p><strong>WPASTEEL</strong>: One thing hurting the steelers this year is Ben’s contract.. Why did the steelers give him such a huge salary at the end of his career? 34m per year next 2..come on Ben you could have played for $27 million <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It was a risk, but a calculated one when you consider the importance of quarterbacks in the NFL. I can’t sit here and guarantee to you that it was the right move - what happened last season is already casting doubt on that - but I think I can at least give you the “why” from the Steelers’ perspective. And as for a player taking a hometown discount, that never does much for me. It’s an individual choice, and I find it a bit irresponsible to criticize someone for accepting less than they’re worth if they don’t want to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I am still confused by what happened to all of the cap savings that was tied up in Antonio Brown (and even Bell). All I hear is well that was used on other players. Who? Brown’s cap hit last year was massive - over $20 million. That should not have gotten eaten up by a few extra players this year. What if brown were still on the team and we had that $20 million plus hit this year? And if we had Bell too and the contract they offered him? Steelers haven’t replaced those guys with salaries anywhere near that big. Just seems like there should be more cap space available than what some are reporting. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well, you’ve also seen a lot of guys’ cap number go up year-over-year. Ben and Stephon Tuitt, who I’ll remind you had his contract restructured last season to help with this, will be about $12 million more combined against the cap. Others such as Anthony Chickillo and Mark Barron signed back-loaded two-year deals, which is why you see people saying the Steelers have to cut them loose.</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: Good morning Brian...since it appears the Steelers may not be able to keep Hargrave, is trading him a possibility? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not really. He’s an unrestricted free agent. You’d likely have to tag him and trade him, which would probably be just as complicated as trying to fit him back under the cap for even one more year.</p>
<p><strong>Alan F</strong>: Have you heard any rumblings about former Steelers, current Detroit Lions TE Jesse James. There were some rumors that the team might slide James as the 3rd TE behind Hockenson &amp; Logan Thomas. If true, would Lions part ways? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Haven’t seen that, but admittedly, I’m not doing too many deep dives on the Lions tight end depth chart. But based on some quick research, it would be quite cost-prohibitive for them to cut him. I suppose they could trade him, but that’s looking like a bad deal, at least based on his usage. Keep cashing those checks, though, Jesse. Glassport stand up.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: The P-G Steelers reporters have seemed pretty split on where you all think the team will go at #49 between TE, WR, RB and OLine. Are you all going to put some money on which position goes first? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: We could bet money, but I don’t think my wife would love that. Maybe a relegation system of some sort. Winner never has to do another chat, and the other writers split up his days.</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Brian, will you be doing a mock draft? I think I’ve only seen Ray’s mock draft. Thanks! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I sure as heck will. You can never have too much mock draft content. A lot of sites now even do mock-re-drafts from previous years. Amazing! But what I end up doing might be a little different flavor than what Ray does. Stay tuned for that.</p>
<p><strong>Duck</strong>: Do you think Duck will be a QB somewhere next year? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That’s a tough one, but my idea for Duck is that the NFL should fly him out to wherever the Sunday Night Football game is each week and he can be the emergency QB for both teams, as a nod to his legendary star turn against the Chargers last year. He’d be like that zamboni driver guy from the NHL. Maybe even make it a reality show or something.</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: Your thoughts on transition tag on Dupree, to me that makes alot more sense with no first round pick this year. Thanks <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: And let other teams negotiate with him, potentially driving up his price even more? By all indications, that’s exactly what the Steelers want to avoid, because they want him back on this defense in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Duquesnedave</strong>: I think that duck has flown... <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: As last year showed us, count out the Duckman at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong>: Can the defense stop the run? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Depends who’s running it. My 7-week-old answered that one.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://my.post-gazette.com/purchase/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=steelers" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2018/08/06/steelers-subscribe-banner-2" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: 49th pick dobbins wat say you? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Wouldn’t love it. I like him as a player, but I think I’m on record as saying I wouldn’t go RB in the second round and maybe wouldn’t do it at all in this draft. Not just because of If Healthy, James Conner (please use his proper name) but I still like Jaylen Samuels, Benny Snell and maybe even Kerrith Whyte. Next year should be another strong RB class, at least at the top.</p>
<p><strong>ZO</strong>: Do you think that if the Steelers draft a WR at pick #49, it demonstrates a lack of commitment to JuJU? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not necessarily, ZO. But I could see it as demonstrating a lack of belief in James Washington and, to a lesser extent, Diontae Johnson. Of course, we keep hearing again and again about the depth of this WR class, so that’d be easy enough to spin if you’re the front office and you go that direction.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They have until Thursday to tag Bud, is this move def going to happen? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nothing is definite until a team announces it, but it’d be awfully surprising. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: ... if they don’t tag him, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: what are thoughts about bringing in Tyler Eifert? I get his is also risk prone but he an Mcdonald when healthy would be tough to match up against? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They would, but you already have one guy who’s fairly unreliable at that spot, and what happens if both go down? You’re running Zach Gentry out there as a starter in Year 2? Gentry could yet pan out, but he has a long way to go to show he’s varsity-capable, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Watson</strong>: I would like to see the steelers draft a running back in the mold of fast Willie Parker. Do you think this could happen? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well, Willie was an undrafted guy himself, so maybe they can unearth another gem. I think the Steelers COULD draft a running back, I just don’t necessarily think they will, and I definitely don’t think they should. Let’s see where they’re at with Conner and Co. this time a year from now.</p>
<p><strong>CincySteelerfan</strong>: Brian, is Dangerfield a FA or is he signed? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Jordan Dangerfield is a restricted free agent. Certainly no guarantee that he’ll make the 53 again next year out of camp.</p>
<p><strong>TomnBloomfield</strong>: Will Bud D. be exclusive or non exclusive tag? Thanks B.B.! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Have to imagine it’ll be exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>SD Stiller</strong>: Hey BB....Who would YOU draft with our first pick? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Might change my mind once or twice or five times between now and when the Steelers are on the clock at 49 overall, but I’ll say Brycen Hopkins, tight end from Purdue.</p>
<p><strong>dane</strong>: rhett ellison? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thank you, Dane. That’s all the time we have for today’s chat. You’re all wonderful people.</p>
