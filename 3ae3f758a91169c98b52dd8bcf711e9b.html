<h1>Feds say state can't distribute additional aid to families losing out on school meals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Federal officials have rejected a plan from the state to continue a program that gave millions of dollars to Pennsylvania families to make up for missed school meals due to pandemic-related school closures.</p>
<p>State human service officials had planned to distribute funds to the families of about 300,000 school children later this month, but federal officials have said that plan can't go forward.</p>

<p>When schools closed suddenly in the spring, state officials were able to get funds to the families of about 1 million Pennsylvania school children to make up for missed free and reduced-price school meals.</p>
<p>The Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) program gave families $5.70 per child per day — about $370.50 in a one-time payment — via electronic debit cards.</p>
<p>With many schools remaining closed to in-person instruction in the fall, state human service officials had planned to issue another round of benefits before the end of September, though to a more limited group of children, due to time constraints and administrative hurdles involved in coordinating between the Department of Human Services and hundreds of school districts.</p>
<p>The state had planned to distribute funds — $128.92 per child —&nbsp;to the families of students in so-called “community eligibility” schools that are operating with remote learning. Community eligibility schools are high-poverty school districts where all students are automatically eligible for free meals.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Pennsylvania's plan "does not meet statutory requirements." The spokesperson said the agency continues to work with states, but with the program set to end at the end of the month, it’s unlikely aid will get to families if the federal government won't accept this plan.</p>
<p>Department of Agriculture officials also point out the agency has extended programs that allow free meals to be served at schools</p>
<p>Pandemic-EBT was a critical support for families, said Pennsylvania Human Services Secretary Teresa Miller.</p>
<p>“We still have people who could really use these resources,” she said.</p>
<p>While some still-closed schools are offering meals to-go, Ms. Miller said that's not an option for every family due to transportation, time, and other constraints.</p>
<p>Dennis McManus, government affairs director for the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, said while food banks and other charities have made enormous efforts to aid hungry families, a program like Pandemic-EBT allows families to shop for grocery items that they need.</p>
<p>“The [USDA] gave states too little time to make a good plan,” said Ann Sanders, policy advocate at anti-hunger group Just Harvest. “They are letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. This is a brand new program ... our state had a plan that served over 300,000 kids and now they aren't able to do so.”</p>
<p>The funds could still be distributed if Congress acts to extend the program beyond the end of the month.</p>
<p>“We hope to be able to issue P-EBT benefits for September and the entire 2020-21 school year to all Pennsylvanians who qualify, and hope to see an extension of this program in the next federal relief bill,” said Pennsylvania Department of Human Services spokeswoman Ali Fogarty.</p>
