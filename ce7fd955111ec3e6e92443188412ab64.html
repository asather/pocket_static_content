<h1>Brian O'Neill: The goatee that travels back in time</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“While I continue to enjoy your column, I regret to inform you that someone is drawing a beard on your picture.”</p>
<p>That email from Roberta Needleman in Squirrel Hill arrived Thursday morning. It’s one of many I’ve received since a new column photo began running this month. The reviews have not been good.</p>
<p>“I must say I am sorely disappointed that you have succumbed to the fad of facial hair,” Michael S. Radella of New Sewickley wrote. “I understand that the ‘boyish’ photo of the past is no longer applicable, but this poor man’s U.S. Grant look is not flattering, in my humble (and unneeded) opinion.”</p>
<p>Fair enough, but what you see is what I look like. As I explained to another emailer, the facial hair might be new to the mug shot but not to me. It began growing on a rugged walk through Maryland on the Appalachian Trail a couple of springs ago, which is not a place where sane men shave.</p>
<p>After four days on the AT, I returned to Harpers Ferry, W.Va., to discover the trail’s souvenir T-shirts were 20 bucks apiece. It seemed wiser to keep the foldable portrait of Andrew Jackson in my wallet and let the whiskers be my souvenir.</p>
<p>The goatee has been keeping my chin warm and scaring small children since.</p>
<p>At this point in my life, it suits me. Truth is I never had much of a chin. God got to the end of my face and evidently lost interest.</p>
<p>And it’s not as if the PG rushed into this. It’s the nature of newspapers to let mug shots fester for years. I asked for the photo before this one after my hair had begun graying and I started wearing glasses full-time, because I’d grown tired of going out into the wild and hearing, “You don’t look like your picture,” with these declarations made by people turning ever so slightly away, clearly fearing that whatever happened to me might happen to them.</p>
<p>“It’s called getting old,” I found myself saying.&nbsp;“And you’re no box of chocolates yourself,” is something I managed to swallow.</p>
<p>What’s funny about our digital age, though, is that I’m now my current age (63 years, 10 months) for as far back as anyone cares to look. I’ve been writing columns for Pittsburgh newspapers for more than 31 years, and I’m guessing I have had at least a half-dozen mug shots in that time.&nbsp;But when I went back to see exactly which column was the first to sport this hirsute look, I found that every old online column has this face, even in the years when I was clean-shaven and my hair was as brown as whole wheat bread (the crust, mind you).</p>
<p>It’s like the plot of Oscar Wilde’s “The Portrait of Dorian Gray,” only now all my sins, journalist and otherwise, have been imposed on the photo adorning every column I’ve ever written, at least in the web versions. Or maybe the better analogy is George Orwell’s memory hole in&nbsp;“1984,”&nbsp;&nbsp;where the ironically named Ministry of Truth dispatches inconvenient truths into oblivion as if they’d never happened.</p>
<p>“Your youth has been erased digitally,” a colleague coldly informed me.</p>
<p>Understand this wasn’t intentional. It’s just the way the widget works in our system. The computer sees the byline and grabs the corresponding image. I can no more stop that from happening than astronaut Dave could get his computer, HAL, to open the pod bay doors in&nbsp;“2001: A Space Odyssey.”</p>
<p>There’s comfort knowing my old self is still in print somewhere, lining a bird cage, wrapping something fragile in a box, or waiting to be recycled into a cereal box or an egg carton. My last clean-shaven mug shot was on the Thursday, Jan. 16 PG op-ed page, below an essay about a young married couple, Harry and Meghan SomethingOrOther, who are relocating from England to Canada.</p>
<p>Life goes on. For now, I’m keeping a decade-old photo on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/brotheroneill" target="_blank">my Twitter page</a>, more out of laziness and technophobia than anything else. But I’m not shaving. My one-and-only likes the goatee, and the new photo offers ample evidence that I’m nearing retirement. I now can afford that, what with all I’ve been saving these past couple of years on shaving cream and razors.</p>
