<h1>Tuned In: AMC ends ‘Saul;’ Hulu sets ‘Little Fires Everywhere’ </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PASADENA, Calif. – AMC’s “Breaking Bad” spin-off “Better Call Saul” returns for its 10-episode fifth season Feb. 23. The cable network announced this week during the Television Critics Association winter 2020 press tour that the series will conclude with a 13-episode sixth season to air in 2021.</p>
<p>“Saul” star Bob Odenkirk said season five moves faster than previous seasons.</p>
<p>“The snowball is coming down the mountain and breaking up,” he said.</p>
<p>Co-star Jonathan Banks said it’s also a more violent season.</p>
<p>“The budget for blank cartridges went up probably by 10,000 in this particular season,” said series co-creator Vince Gilligan, who wasn’t involved in the writing this year – co-creator Peter Gould was the showrunner – but directs episode eight.</p>

<p>Gould said “Breaking Bad” characters Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) do not appear in season five – “Bad” regular Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) is back for two episodes – but Gilligan said he would like to find a way to work the pair into the final season of “Saul.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for whether there will be another series in the “Breaking Bad” universe, Gilligan said after two series and last fall’s “El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,” he’s probably done.</p>
<p>“I think you could put too much hot fudge on the sundae, and I don’t wanna be guilty of that,” he said.</p>
<p>Odenkirk joked that Banks will star in an animated spin-off, “Baby Mike,” for upstart streamer Quibi, beating up adversaries with a rattle while still somehow caring for his granddaughter even though he’s a baby.</p>
<p>“All good stories end. You don’t beat it to death. Who cares about ‘Star Wars 7’?’” Banks said, sitting just a few feet away from “Saul” co-star Giancarlo Esposito, who’s also on the Disney+ “Star Wars” series “The Mandalorian.”</p>
<p>“I do,” Esposito said, prompting laughter from the entire cast.</p>
<p><strong>‘Little Fires’ coming soon</strong></p>
<p>Hulu’s “Little Fires Everywhere” (March 18), based on the novel by Pittsburgh native Celeste Ng, casts Reese Witherspoon as a wealthy busybody not too different from the one she played in HBO’s “Big Little Lies.”</p>
<p>Witherspoon plays the matriarch of the Shaker Heights, Ohio, Richardson family. Kerry Washington stars as an enigmatic woman who arrives in town with her daughter and enters the Richardsons’ lives.</p>
<p>“She starts off in this familiar way: She’s Type A, she’s a mom, she gets [stuff] done,” executive producer Liz Tigelaar said of Witherspoon’s character. “Where she goes in the course of these episodes … is so raw and so vulnerable and so unhinged in some ways but really stripped down to her core.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to say it’s a slow burn but it’s a slow burn that runs into a rapid, fast descent. I think that’s something that’s so relatable, to have the moment in our lives that strips us bare.”</p>

<p><strong>‘Hillary’ on Hulu</strong></p>
<p>On March 6, Hulu debuts “Hillary,” a four-part documentary series that explores how Hillary Clinton became one of the most admired and most vilified women in the world.</p>
<p>The former Secretary of State and past presidential candidate said the series began as a possible Clinton campaign documentary by filmmaker Nanette Burstein, who spent 35 hours interviewing Clinton.</p>
<p>“There were a lot of humbling moments,” Clinton said. “One was the recognition that I have been — often in my view — mischaracterized and misperceived, and I have to bear a lot of the responsibility for that whatever the combination of reasons might be. I certainly didn’t do a good enough job to break through a lot of the perceptions that were out there.”</p>
<p>Clinton implored viewers to vote thoughtfully in the 2020 Democratic primary,&nbsp;noting “this is no ordinary time.</p>
<p>“Vote for the person you think is most likely to win” in the general election, she said. “That is what will matter and not just the popular vote, [but in] the electoral college.”</p>

<p><strong>Prepping Peacock</strong></p>
<p>NBCUniversal’s upcoming streaming service Peacock will launch April 15 for Comcast Xfinity X1 and Flex customers and will be available to everyone July 15.&nbsp;Peacock comes in two tiers:</p>
<p>Peacock Free, a free ad-supported option that will include next-day access to current seasons of freshman NBC series, classic series but only some episodes of original series.</p>
<p>Peacock Premium, also ad-supported, includes access to current seasons of returning NBC shows and full seasons of Peacock originals. It is free to Comcast and Cox cable customers and&nbsp;$4.99 per month for others. Peacock Premium customers can upgrade to an ad-free Peacock for $5 more per month.</p>
<p>Peacock will stream the full library of Dick Wolf series (“Law &amp; Order,” “Chicago Fire,” etc.) and offer episodes of Paramount Network’s “Yellowstone” and “Two and a Half Men” reruns.</p>
<p>Original Peacock series include a “Saved by the Bell” sequel, new episodes of “A.P. Bio” and another “Battlestar Galactica” reboot.&nbsp;Peacock will also carry the 2020 Tokyo Olympics opening and closing ceremonies live before they air on delay in NBC’s prime time.</p>
<p>Starting in July, NBC’s “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” will be available at 8 p.m. followed by “Late Night with Seth Meyers” at 9 p.m., 3½&nbsp;hours before they air on NBC.</p>
<p><strong>‘Seven Worlds’</strong></p>
<p>BBC America debuts the seven-part “Seven Worlds, One Planet” (9 p.m. Saturday, BBC America, AMC, IFC, Sundance TV), exploring Earth’s seven continents and how they shape animal behavior. The new natural history series follows the success of “Planet Earth” and “Blue Planet.”</p>
<p>“It’s a good example of how the wildlife genre has evolved,” said producer Chadden Hunter. “It was a dry textbook thing decades ago, and what we’re doing now with these big, global blockbuster series is we’re really going into that drama genre.</p>
<p>“We want to pull on those heart strings. We want you to cry with those animals. We want you to laugh. And I think back in the day when you’d call it a true documentary, it was just more about pure education, whereas now we want to take you on an emotional roller coaster ride.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Paddington’ premieres</strong></p>
<p>The new animated preschool series “The Adventures of Paddington” premieres at 10:30 a.m. Monday on Nickelodeon featuring Ben Whishaw, who also voices Paddington in the live-action movies.&nbsp;But don’t hold your breath for another live-action film.</p>
<p>After a press conference last week for FX’s “Fargo,” Whishaw said he’s heard no news of a third movie.</p>
<p>“I think it would be nice. Maybe three is a good number,” he said, noting that he’d only be interested if Paul King, the writer/director of the first two movies, returned.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine anyone else doing it now. The first one is wonderful but I think the second one’s perfect. You wouldn’t want to do a third that was somehow less. Otherwise leave it while you’re ahead.”</p>
<p><strong>Channel surfing</strong></p>
<p>Green Tree native Zachary Quinto traipses through a Panama jungle as next week’s guest star on National Geographic Channel’s “Running Wild with Bear Grylls” (10 p.m. Tuesday). … “The Walking Dead: World Beyond,” the third “Dead” series following two sisters who grew up in a world of walkers, debuts at 10 p.m. April 12 on AMC. … A former Animal Planet series will be revived on BBC America in 2021: “Meerkat Manor: Rise of the Dynasty” follows three families descended from the original meerkat matriarch. … Hulu renewed “Wu-Tang: An American Saga” and “Dollface” for sophomore seasons. … Freeform renewed “grown-ish” for a fourth season and “Good Trouble” for a third.</p>
