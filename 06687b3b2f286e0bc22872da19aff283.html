<h1> Baltimore Museum to sell Warhol’s ‘Last Supper’ </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Baltimore Museum of Art plans to sell three paintings, including one by Andy Warhol, in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>As museums face increasing financial pressures and industrywide demands from staff to create more equitable workplaces, the institution is taking advantage of the Association of Art Museum Directors’ temporary pandemic-era loosening of its guidelines for museums looking to sell paintings — a process called deaccession. The rules now allow deaccession to fund the direct care of collections, not just the acquisition of other artworks.</p>
<p>The Baltimore Museum expects to receive about $65 million for the paintings — by Warhol, Brice Marden and Clyfford Still — from a combination of an auction and a private sale at Sotheby’s.</p>
<p>Warhol’s “The Last Supper” (1986), being offered through private sale, is a significant work from a major series, but it is one of 15 paintings by the artist in the collection, many also late-career works.</p>
<p>Unlike the Brooklyn Museum in New York, which announced the sale of 12 paintings in September after it had to make substantial layoffs, the Baltimore Museum has a balanced budget. With some creative juggling of revenue streams, it intends to use its $65 million to help advance salary increases across the board, invest in diversity and inclusion programs, offer evening hours and eliminate admission fees for special exhibitions.</p>
<p>“This is a vision-based initiative, not desperation-based,” said Christopher Bedford, the Baltimore Museum’s director.</p>
<p>In 2018, Mr. Bedford led the museum’s deaccessioning of seven paintings by blue-chip names to bring into the collection new works by lesser-known artists of color, better reflecting the city’s majority Black population. Now, he is taking a parallel action to respond to demands from his own staff members to address the extraordinary disparity of compensation between the lower end of the hierarchy and the top that is found at museums around the country.</p>
<p>“This is done specifically in recognition of the protest being led by museum staff to be paid an equitable living wage to perform core work for an institution with a social justice mission — that symmetry between who we say we are and what we actually are behind our doors,” said Mr. Bedford.</p>
