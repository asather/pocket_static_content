<h1>Paul Zeise: Keith Dambrot is building his own 'Believeland' on the Bluff</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Keith Dambrot has said one of the main reasons he took the job as Duquesne men’s basketball coach was to be a part of reviving the program his dad, Sidney, played for in the 1950s. He wanted to help end the misery of the legion of long-suffering Dukes fans who have watched their program stumble along to something below mediocrity since their last appearance in the NCAA tournament in 1977.</p>
<p>There was some skepticism about Dambrot’s claims when he was hired. Was he just the latest in a long and seemingly endless string of newly hired Duquesne coaches to make bold predictions only to be fired a few years later?</p>
<p>That doesn’t appear to be the case, as Dambrot&nbsp;has&nbsp; built the Dukes into a formidable force in the Atlantic 10. They are 15-2 (5-0 in conference play), and they are on a five-game winning streak. Dambrot said it has taken a lot of hard work by the players and coaches to become a winning program, but they are nowhere close to where he envisions the Dukes can be.</p>
<p>“People can call me overly optimistic, but that’s just who I’ve always been,” Dambrot said.&nbsp;“I know there are still a lot of long-suffering Duquesne fans out there and they are sort of like Cleveland fans were before LeBron brought a championship there: They are so used to bad things happening they keep waiting for the wheels to fall off the truck.</p>
<p>“And I understand that and can’t blame them, but that’s not going to happen with this group.&nbsp;We went from 16 wins the first year, to 19 wins last year and now we are 15-2, and this group is too tough-minded for us to go backward. We have too many guys who are winners and who are used to winning to worry about it all falling apart.”</p>
<p>Dambrot is 61, but he said he feels like a 25-year old coach again because building Duquesne has revitalized him. He is obviously a strong-minded person who has been toughened by a lot of tough breaks and twist in turns in his coaching career. His message of persistence paying off probably resonates well with his players because they just need to look at his career as an example.</p>
<p>He’s also not going to rest until he gets the Dukes back to the NCAA tournament, though his focus right now isn’t the big picture but rather the daily grind. He believes his team has improved every week and said if that continues then the postseason will take care of itself.</p>
<p>“I have a chip on my shoulder because of my dad and the Duquesne fans and all they have endured,” Dambrot said.&nbsp;“I don’t want to fail, I don’t want to let them down, I would love to be a part of bringing it back to what it was for all of them. But we all have to do our part every day, and for the most part the guys have done a great job of staying focused.”</p>
<p>Dambrot refers to himself as old school, and there is nothing about him that would suggest he isn’t. He is a little bit fiery, his teams are disciplined, they defend and they play with an edge. The program is built on hard work and toughness.</p>
<p>Dambrot is so old school that he turned down an opportunity to break the Dukes’ postseason drought in each of the last two seasons, turning down invitations to the CBI. He wants the Dukes to earn their way into either the NCAA tournament or the NIT because making either field is an accomplishment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dukes’ mental toughness and focus has been challenged this season on several fronts. They have not had a home court all season because the Palumbo Center is being renovated. They have had to play through injuries to key players. Most recently, freshman Maceo Austin’s sister died and the team had to rally around him and play through some emotional days.</p>
<p>Dambrot said he’s been proud of the way his team has responded to everything that has been thrown at them this season because it speaks volumes about their character. And don’t let him fool you — he sets the tone because he absolutely refuses to make excuses and complain when things don’t go well.</p>
<p>“I have not really talked about or focused on the gym stuff,” Dambrot said.&nbsp;“Our guys just want to play, and let’s face it, these guys play in hundreds of gyms all through AAU, so this is nothing for them. It could be a crutch or an excuse, but it can’t be if we don’t ever focus on it. I just downplay the whole thing.</p>
<p>“The way the guys rallied around Maceo was special, but it doesn’t surprise me. We are like a family, and that’s how families treat each other.”</p>
<p>Dambrot indeed might be a dreamer, but it takes a dreamer to revive a program that was as bad as Duquesne has been for the better part of four decades. I, too, was skeptical when I listened to Dambrot’s first press conference as Dukes coach, but he’s certainly made a believer out of me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dukes are not just a really good story; they are a really good basketball team, and that’s a testament to Dambrot’s work.</p>
