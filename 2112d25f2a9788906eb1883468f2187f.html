<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Tuesday announced $775 million in spending cuts over the next two months to schools, colleges, Medicaid, and elsewhere to plug a widening hole in the state’s two-year budget from pandemic-related revenue losses.</p>
<p>In the span of two months, the state went from registering revenue collections $200 million above projections to a nearly $777 million shortfall as Mr. DeWine intentionally put much of Ohio’s economy into hibernation to weather the coronavirus storm.</p>
<p>“That is the most dramatic swing that I can ever recall,” said Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, who as a former senator and House speaker has dealt with severe budget cuts before. “We don’t know how long it’s going to last.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Mr. DeWine opted not to tap the state’s budgetary reserves yet. The “rainy day” fund currently holds more than $2.7 billion, socked away from budget surpluses enjoyed over the last decade. He said budget woes related to coronavirus will remain when the state enters the second half of its current two-year budget on July 1 and possibly the year after.</p>
<p>“This rain is not a passing spring shower,” he said. “It could be — we don’t really know — a long, cold, lingering storm. We should not use that rainy day funding until we have to.”</p>
<p>Despite the somber news, the governor said the damage to state revenues was not what led him to begin to slowly reopen the state’s economy beginning last Friday.</p>
<p>K-12 schools will take the biggest hit at $300 million, a 3.7 percent cut in districts’ total annual aid, compressed into the final two months of the nearly $70 billion budget for this fiscal year. Other education services will be cut by $55 million.</p>
<p>Toledo Public Schools Treasurer Ryan Stechschulte said the news was expected.</p>
<p>“We anticipated budget reductions for the remainder of this year, and we’re anticipating budget reductions for the next school year also,” he said. “We’re not surprised by the news based on the decline of state revenues.”</p>
<p>Mr. Stechschulte added that district officials are awaiting more details from the state.</p>
<p>“Based on what the governor said, the state budget director will provide more details,” he said. “But at this time we don’t have details on the amount, but hopefully we get those details tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The cuts occur even as K-12 schools don’t know what awaits them this fall. The governor has shut down physical classroom instruction for the remainder of this academic year, but it’s unclear how — or if — school buildings will reopen as usual in August or September.</p>
<p>The governor has talked about a variety of options, including continuing online instruction or a hybrid approach in which some students study in the classroom on one day while others come in the next.</p>
<p>Medicaid — the government-run health insurance of last resort for the poor, disabled, and infirm — will take the second-biggest hit at $210 million. Mr. DeWine, however, said he is intent on making that cut without reducing services for those populations at a time when they’re most in need.</p>
<p>Higher education will be slashed by $110 million. Most other agencies will be cut by $100 million, although the governor said he does not expect cuts in the state’s prison system ravaged by coronavirus infections.</p>
<p>Direct subsidies to local governments were not among the cuts announced, although Mr. DeWine did not rule them out in the future. Municipalities, however, can expect to take a hit anyway because they rely on income from a distribution formula that is tied to a share of state revenue collections that have tanked.</p>
<p>The governor’s own H2Ohio program to tackle toxic algal growth on Lake Erie and other waters was not spared. The program depends on funding in the current two-year budget as well as shares of current budget surpluses that are now very much in doubt.</p>
<p>“We’re still very committed to that program,” he said. “This is something for the long term. We want to keep that program going as robust as we can, but again subject to where this economy is going.”</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture recently cut off applications early for programs to help farmers take steps to reduce fertilizer runoff from their fields that fuels algal growth.</p>
<p>The announcement of budget cuts came just as the number of reported coronavirus deaths in the state spiked Tuesday, jumping by 79 to a total of 1,135, well above above the average of 39 additional deaths per day seen over the last 21 days. Mr. DeWine and his health director, Dr. Amy Acton, are looking at longer-term trends they hope will support decisions to gradually open up Ohio’s economy.</p>
<p>The total number of new infections climbed by 495 to 20,969, below the 21-day average. Hospitalizations were up by 147 and intensive-care unit stays by 33.</p>
<p>Coronavirus deaths in Lucas County have climbed to 140, health officials announced Tuesday, as 1,377 total cases have been confirmed so far in the county.</p>
<p>The latest report from the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department identifies 16 more deaths in the county, with age representation ranging from 60 to 100. The deaths occurred between April 15 and Tuesday.</p>
<p>Of the 140 total deaths reported, 122 have been confirmed, while 18 more are considered “probable.” In addition to the 1,377 confirmed cases, 71 more are probable. The age range in Lucas County among cases is from 3 to 100 and 866 cases are women as opposed to 582 men, according to the report.</p>
<p>Lucas County has the most coronavirus deaths in the state of Ohio, according to state and local statistics.</p>
<p>Wednesday will mark the first weekday since the crisis began in early March that Mr. DeWine will not hold a daily briefing on the crisis. Instead, his budget director will provide more details to reporters on the budget cuts. In recent weeks, he has stopped holding the briefings on weekends.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine and Dr. Acton have said they fully expect an increase in new infections as Ohioans re-engage with one another, preferably while wearing facial coverings.</p>
<p>Hospitals and doctor, dentist, veterinarian, and other medical offices were permitted to reopen beginning Friday for routine, outpatient procedures —assuming they have sufficient personal protection equipment to do so.</p>
<p>Manufacturers, distribution facilities, and construction companies were allowed to open as of Monday as long as they engage in distancing, hygiene, cleansing, and other precautions to protect employees. Business offices were also allowed to reopen but were encouraged to continue having employees work from home when possible.</p>
<p>Retail stores and some service-sector businesses may reopen as of May 12 as long as they take measures to protect both employees and customers. Employees must wear masks, but there is no such mandate for customers. Stores could open sooner for business by appointment or through curbside service.</p>
<p>He will announce on Thursday when restaurants, bars, and some other businesses may reopen.</p>
