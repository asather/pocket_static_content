<h1>Gerry Dulac: Steelers-Titans week could've been a whole lot worse</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One thing should be ascertained from what transpired last week when the NFL <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/10/01/steelers-titans-postponement-covid-19-outbreak-nfl-tennessee/stories/202010010109" target="_blank">postponed the Steelers game</a> with the Tennessee Titans <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/10/02/when-do-steelers-play-titans-ravens-rescheduled-week-7/stories/202010020186" target="_blank">until Oct. 25</a>.</p>
<p>Do not feel sorry for the Steelers. Do not think they got a raw deal. Do not think they are being punished for something that happened with the Titans, not them.</p>
<p>Sure, the Steelers wanted to play Sunday. Of course they did. They are 3-0 and on an early-season roll, and no team wants to interrupt that. That’s why they are disappointed — Mike Tomlin’s word — the game was postponed. Plus, nobody wants a bye week just four weeks into a season, especially a team that has designs on playing into the postseason.</p>
<p>But the situation could have been a whole lot worse for everyone, including the Steelers. And the league.</p>
<p>If there is some good news in what happened with the positive COVID-19 tests that afflicted members of the Titans and forced the postponement, it is that it happened this early in the season, before the Steelers or any other team had their bye week. It gave the league the flexibility to use some open dates to manipulate the schedule.</p>
<p>Imagine if this would have happened after Dec. 7, which is the final Sunday for a bye? Of course, it still could. And then the NFL would have an even bigger problem on its hands. That’s why the league has already discussed the possibility of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2020/10/01/pittsburgh-steelers-tenessee-titans-COVID-19-buffer-week-and-forfeits/stories/202010010158" target="_blank">tacking on an 18th week</a> to the schedule to accommodate some of the problems that might arise from the pandemic.</p>
<p>Here’s another thing:</p>
<p>By deciding to postpone the game on Thursday, the league avoided the one thing it really didn’t want to happen: have the Steelers fly to Nashville, as scheduled, on Saturday and then decide at the 11th hour the game had to be postponed. The Steelers would have wasted a whole week of practice, time, energy and even money for a game that was never played.</p>
<p>And one more thing: This idea the Steelers get cheated out of a bye week is being slightly exaggerated.</p>
<p>In a normal year, the Steelers would still practice during a bye week, using two days — Tuesday and Wednesday — to give their younger players a chance to work. Last week wasn’t much different. Once he knew the Titans game was postponed, coach Mike Tomlin moved up Thursday’s practice, shortened it and worked a lot of the backup players. The players practiced two days — Wednesday and Thursday — then had the next three days off.</p>
<p>What’s more, it wasn’t as though they could leave town and return home or take a weekend getaway. Players still have to report to the South Side for their daily testing for the virus.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for sympathy for the Steelers, don’t expect it to come from the head coach. When asked what he thought about having to play 13 games in a row, and maybe more, without a break, Tomlin delivered the perfect answer that did not allow for any excuses, either from him, his players or the organization:</p>
<p>“We do not care.”</p>
<p>None of this is to suggest the situation is ideal, But, as with so many other aspects of daily life in this pandemic-altered world, it is something to which the Steelers will adjust. They don’t have much choice.</p>
<p><strong>Man in the middle</strong></p>
<p>While the coronavirus has disrupted everyone’s world, inside linebacker Vince Williams actually credits the pandemic for the way he has been playing.</p>
<p>At age 30, he has been as impactful as any player in the Steelers defense for the first three games.</p>
<p>“I think my relationship with the game of football has changed significantly and allowed me to take a lot of pressure off myself when I play now,” Williams said. “I used to be victim of outside influences and criticism and now, since the coronavirus and quarantine, a lot of other things in my life have shifted around and really started to help me prioritize things in my life. I think that’s led to a tremendous amount of success.”</p>
<p>Williams might be a liability in coverage, but his increased workload this season is probably the main reason for the improvement in the run defense, which ranks second in the NFL (54 yards per game). The Steelers rely on him to run blitz, make plays behind the line of scrimmage and stuff opposing running backs, and he has done it all after three games.</p>
<p>Williams has been so disruptive that he leads the league with eight tackles for loss, three more than anyone else (including teammate T.J. Watt). And he does it with a mix of knowledge, anticipation, timing and aggressiveness.</p>
<p>Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald led the league last season with 20 tackles for loss. Bud Dupree, who led the Steelers with 16, was tied for seventh. After just three games, Williams is already halfway to Dupree’s total.</p>
<p>For the record, the single-season record is 39, set by Texans defensive end J.J. Watt in 2012. (Yeah, I know, Williams is on pace to break that mark).</p>
<p>Williams is one of those players who not only understands his role in the defense, he knows what everyone else is supposed to be doing within the framework of the defense. And the Steelers have given him another chance to show it.</p>
<p>Williams has appeared for 137 snaps, or 71.4% of the time. While seven defensive starters have been on the field more — inside linebacker Devin Bush and cornerback Joe Haden have played all 192 snaps — Williams is back playing more frequently after sitting behind Bush and Mark Barron for most of the 2019 season.</p>
<p>He averaged just 24.8 snaps per game last season. His reps have nearly doubled this season, averaging 45.6 plays per game.</p>
<p>The Steelers are keeping their fingers crossed when Williams has to drop into coverage. They know teams are trying to get him into mismatches with running backs or even wide receivers. Already this season, he has unwittingly found himself in deep single coverage on Denver rookie receiver Jerry Jeudy and Houston’s Brandin Cooks. Fortunately for the Steelers, both passes were overthrown and incomplete.</p>
<p>But they will continue to roll the dice as long as he keeps doing what he has for their run defense. And that is drastically improve it.</p>
