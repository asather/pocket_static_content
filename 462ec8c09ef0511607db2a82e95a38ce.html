<h1>Whitehall man charged with stockpiling weapons and making threats is ordered detained</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Whitehall man arrested last month after police said he had homemade bombs and many guns in his car and house will remain jailed.</p>
<p>A federal magistrate judge on Wednesday ordered that Kurt Cofano, 33, be detained pending trial in U.S. District Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Cofano was indicted in July on firearms and explosives charges.</p>
<p>Police said they found him in possession of homemade bombs on July 9 and 10. He also was in possession of marijuana and had a gun. Authorities said that from May through July, he made destructive devices without registering them.</p>
<p>In all, federal agents said Mr. Cofano had 12 guns, 14 improvised grenades and nine destructive devices labeled "M101."</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office said Mr. Cofano had previously threatened on social media to blow up the Treasury Department and kill people at the CIA.</p>
<p>Police were looking for him on a mental health warrant when his car was located in Dormont and pulled over in Mt. Lebanon. The bomb squad searched the car and found what appeared to be bomb-making material and what looked like remote detonators.</p>
<p>He was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation while agents and the bomb squad searched his house.</p>
<p>Inside, they said, they found more bombs, chemicals, a sniper manual and explosive components.</p>
<p>Agents said they found three assault-style rifles, including one equipped with a rocket-launcher, a&nbsp; shotgun, other rifles and three handguns.</p>
<p>Prosecutors asked that Mr. Cofano be detained as a danger to the public.</p>
