<h1>Steelers-Titans scheduled for Week 7, followed by Ravens matchup</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As many surmised from a glance at the Steelers’ upcoming schedule, they will now visit the Tennessee Titans later this month in Week 7 and have their game against the Baltimore Ravens bumped to Week 8. The NFL made the adjustments official Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Steelers were supposed to have Week 8 off but now have an open date this weekend due to their game at Tennessee being postponed after multiple positive COVID-19 tests in&nbsp;the Titans organization. That matchup is rescheduled for a 1 p.m. kickoff Oct. 25, which was the original date for the Steelers’ first meeting with Baltimore. They’ll instead play the Ravens at 1 p.m. Nov. 1.</p>
<p>Other solutions for the postponement of Steelers-Titans that were speculated included moving the game to the end of the regular season, but that would’ve meant pushing back the playoffs by a week. The NFL opted to keep its postseason calendar the same.</p>
<p>This means the Steelers will indeed finish the season playing 13 consecutive weeks, and the two rescheduled contests are part of a three-game road swing that ends with Dallas the week after the Ravens game. Only two other teams in the NFL, the Arizona Cardinals and New Orleans Saints, are scheduled to play three consecutive away games.</p>
