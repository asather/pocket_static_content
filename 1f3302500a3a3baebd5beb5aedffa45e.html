<p>Pennsylvania State Police in Uniontown are looking for information on a road rage incident prior to a Fayette County homicide.</p>
<p>The incident occurred between 3 and 4 p.m. on May 24 in Georges Township on Georges Fairchance Road, between Swaney’s Roller Rink and a Sunoco gas station that shares space with an Arby’s restaurant, according to a release.</p>
<p>A black Acura Integra passed a black Lincoln MKZ and stopped in the roadway. A white man exited the Acura and approached the Lincoln’s passenger side.</p>
<p>Soon after, the white man returned to the Acura and pulled into the Sunoco/Arby’s parking lot.</p>
<p>Police believe the road rage incident is related to a homicide that occurred that afternoon in a Long John Silver’s parking lot on Morgantown Road in South Union Township, Fayette County.</p>
<p>A victim was found in the parking lot with multiple gun shot wounds around 4 p.m. that day, according to Post-Gazette news partner, KDKA.</p>
<p>The suspect was identified as Justin Rittacco, 21, who was arrested and charged with criminal homicide.</p>
<p>Mr. Rittacco was at the restaurant to drop someone off for work when a black Acura pulled up behind him. The victim, Robert Lukehart, got out of the car and ran up to Mr. Rittacco’s window.</p>
<p>Mr. Rittacco told police he shot Mr. Lukehart, 39, because he approached in an “aggressive manner and felt his life was threatened.”</p>
<p>He fired three rounds, which struck Mr. Lukehart in the chest and arm, and fled the scene.</p>
<p>Witnesses to the road rage incident are&nbsp; asked to call Trooper Kristen Zelechowski, lead investigator at (724) 415-1013.</p>
