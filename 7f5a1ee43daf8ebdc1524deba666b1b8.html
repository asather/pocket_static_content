<h1>New Castle upsets Knoch in quarterfinal of boys basketball playoffs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>New Castle didn’t rain down 11 3-pointers on Knoch like it did in its WPIAL Class 4A opening round victory against Mount Pleasant.</p>
<p>Instead the three-time defending champion Red Hurricanes used their size inside peppered with solid outside shooting to move into the semifinals for the 10th consecutive season.</p>
<p>Sophomore Michael Wells had a double-double with 22 points and 12 rebounds, while junior Sheldon Cox finished with 19 points and five boards as the No. 7 Red Hurricanes (17-7) pulled off a 56-50 upset of second-seeded Knoch (19-4) at North Allegheny.</p>
<p>“Probably my biggest concern going into the game was Knoch was just veterans and had been doing this a long time together,” New Castle coach Ralph Blundo said. “But I think what happens when you make 14 3s in a game, people might think that they’re a 3-point shooting team and we shoot a bunch, but I think we can score in a variety of ways.”</p>
<p>Cox set a school record in this gym in his last game with nine bombs from beyond the arc, but was held to three against Knoch. While New Castle only made six 3-pointers as a team, it was able to control the ball and waited to get quality shots against a tough Knoch defense.</p>
<p>New Castle only had three turnovers in the game and just one, late in the third quarter, was because a player mishandled the ball. The other two came off offensive fouls, one on a charge and one on an illegal screen.</p>
<p>“That’s been us for 10 years and we’ve been really good at taking care of the basketball and we’re proud of that,” Blundo said. “We talk so much about extra possessions and you can’t have extra possessions if you’re turning it over. We want to turn people over and offensive rebound.”</p>
<p>Knoch had a pretty good shooting day from the field, converting 18 of 34 (52.9%) from the floor, but was just 9 of 18 from the line which came back to haunt the team in the fourth quarter. The Knights converted just 2 of 7 in the final period, missed both ends of a two-shot foul that would have tied the game and missed the front end of a 1-and-1 that would have also potentially knotted it up.</p>
<p>“We’ve been very good from the free throw line all year and I think we shot like 78% from the line in the season, so for us to do what we did was very uncharacteristic,” Knoch coach Ron McNabb said. “I thought we missed some layups and free throws and they got a couple of long rebounds and we preached that for the last 10 days they were going to get long rebounds.”</p>
<p>Knoch trailed by as many as 11 in the second half before Scott Fraser got rolling late in the third quarter. The senior guard was held to two first half points, but ripped off 15 in after the intermission — including eight in the final frame and a clutch 3-pointer with 2:11 remaining — to help the Knights flip that deficit into a 50-49 lead.</p>
<p>“In the first half they did a good job and Scottie missed a couple shots and I thought he got a little frustrated,” McNabb said. “So then he hit a couple threes, got a little more physical inside and he really bounced back in the second half.”</p>
<p>Even after Fraser drained the 3-poiner for the last of his 17 points, New Castle was undaunted. On the Red Hurricanes next possess, Wells hit a putback that reclaimed the lead, then they forced a Knights turnover on the ensuing possession, which Wells converted into a fast-break bucket and a 53-50 lead with 1:09 remaining.</p>
<p>“I’m really proud of these guys,” Blundo said. “There’s all kind of playoff games to win, but when you win this way against a veteran group like Knoch, it’s a great win.”</p>
