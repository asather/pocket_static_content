<h1>Peduto directly asks Trump: Please support COVID-19 relief funds for local governments</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto is asking President Donald Trump directly to support local government funding in the next federal COVID-19 relief package to offset “massive losses to revenue.”</p>
<p>“Despite years of sound fiscal management, the scale of this crisis has simply been overwhelming – it is only a matter of time before we will face cash flow issues affecting our ability to pay first responders and essential workers. We need relief and we need it now,” Mr. Peduto wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump dated Saturday.</p>
<p>The Trump administration and Democrats <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/04/18/White-House-and-Democrats-negotiate-funding-for-hospitals-as-two-sides-push-for-a-small-business-package-deal/stories/202004180048" target="_blank">continued over the weekend to negotiate</a>&nbsp;the next pandemic relief package. Funding for local governments remains a sticking point.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto warned in his letter that&nbsp;“[d]espite almost no revenue from vital sources such as parking tax, amusement tax, parking revenue, facility usage fees, and deed transfer tax, the City of Pittsburgh continues to incur increased financial costs associated with managing the emergency and public health response, continuing to provide essential services, obtaining critical protective equipment for our frontline workers, and working to provide emergency support to vulnerable residents.’</p>
<p>The city faces an estimated 21% decrease in projected revenues for 2020,&nbsp;“going from $608 million down to $481 million, for a total loss of $127 million,” according to mayor’s office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Echoing Mr. Peduto’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/16/Pittsburgh-Mayor-Bill-Peduto-praises-city-efforts-COVID-19-response-warns-looming-budget-woes/stories/202004160157" target="_blank">public address Thursday</a>, the office also said Monday in a press release that the city could face a 7.5% cut in tax revenue — or $239 million — over the next five years.</p>
<p>The office called the projections&nbsp;“extremely fluid” and said the figures could change depending on how long businesses remain closed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/01/Pittsburgh-to-receive-12-million-community-housing-grants-as-part-of-federal-COVID-19-stimulus-relief-bill/stories/202004010115" target="_blank">city received $12.7 million</a> as part of the unprecedented $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, but that federally-mandated money must be used for community development and emergency housing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only municipalities with populations over 500,000 qualified for other funds under the CARES Act.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto was one of 300 mayors <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/23/Pittsburgh-mayors-Bill-Peduto-letter-implores-federal-state-leaders-to-support-relief-for-cities-workers/stories/202003230085?cid=search" target="_blank">to sign a letter in March</a> requesting from lawmakers in Washington that $250 billion in “flexible, emergency fiscal assistance” be made available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CMS on Monday said it would require nursing homes to inform residents, families and their representatives of COVID-19 cases and CMS plans to make that information publicly available.</p>
