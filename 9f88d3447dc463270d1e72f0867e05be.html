<h1>Penn State COVID-19 cases now top 700 after another large jump this week.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State University’s COVID-19 cases now total 709 — all but one of them students — fueled largely by almost 300 positive tests on the main University Park campus since Tuesday, though officials said a switch to remote classes is not currently needed.</p>
<p>The results are for the week of Sept. 4 through Thursday, and a number of test results for that period are still pending, officials said. A week ago, total cases universitywide stood at 215, which<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/09/04/Penn-State-University-COVID-19-coronavirus-fall-classes-infection-Barron-colleges-online/stories/202009040128" target="_blank"> was almost three times </a>the number from the week before.</p>
<p>The University Park results this week among students included 260 positive results from on-demand or symptomatic testing, and 28 positive results from random or asymptomatic testing.</p>
<p>Random screening of employees has returned one positive result for University Park.</p>
<p>Results still pending can take up to 48 hours and will be included in the dashboard update on Tuesday, officials said</p>
<p>The 215 cases as of last Friday were based on 9,948 tests. The latest universitywide total of 708 plus one employee students is based on about 17,200 tests since Aug. 7</p>
<p>“At this time, we do not need to change our current modality and hybrid on-campus approach,” Penn State President Eric&nbsp; Barron said in a statement Friday.</p>
<p>“The university is monitoring the number of positive and negative cases — and other variables critical to our decision making — including isolation and quarantine capacity, hospitalizations, locational data, transmission from student cases to employees and community prevalence, to name a few.</p>
<p>“Mitigations in our armamentarium include pausing in-person instruction and quarantining a specific program or unit, as we have done with nursing, for example.” he added.</p>
<p>Earlier, officials set aside 400 singles in Eastview Terrace buidings for isolation space.</p>
<p>“At this time, the isolation and quarantine space at University Park is at about 50% capacity,” said Kelly Wolgast, director of the COVID-19 Operations Control Center. “As students complete their isolation period and those quarantining receive negative results, they leave the isolation and quarantine space.</p>
<p>“Prior to Aug. 30, 97 individuals have recovered and are moving out of the space on campus, and more students are expected to be released in the coming days. In addition, the university has the capacity to open more isolation and quarantine space, if needed.”</p>
