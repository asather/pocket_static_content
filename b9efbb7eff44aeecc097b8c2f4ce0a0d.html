<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>19 cats including several kittens were rescued Friday morning from “deplorable conditions” in a White Oak home.</p>
<p>After receiving a report of cats running loose in the home, a Humane Officer of the Humane Animal Rescue obtained a warrant to enter the home and seize the animals, according to a release from the Humane Animal Rescue.</p>
<p>Members of the&nbsp;Humane Animal Rescue’s Humane Investigations team found a mother with three kittens, just shy of a one-week-old, on the first floor of the home. One kitten was found dead. The rest of the cats were located in the basement.</p>
<p>The animals were transported to the Humane Animal Rescue’s East End Campus where they were found to have health problems including being underweight and dehydrated, and they were treated for&nbsp;flea dermatitis, ear mites and gingivitis.</p>
<p>The Humane Animal Rescue said the cats and kittens will receive treatment until they are cleared for adoption.</p>
