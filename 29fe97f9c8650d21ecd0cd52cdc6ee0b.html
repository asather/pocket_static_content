<h1>Dog lovers rally to donate in memory of beagle that was murdered and decapitated</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Social media photographs of a sweet-faced beagle named&nbsp;“Trouble” have sparked outrage and donations for a reward for information about the person who&nbsp;“tortured” and&nbsp;“brutally murdered” the little dog and then put her decapitated head in the East Palestine, Ohio, yard of her owner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“People are scared for their children and their pets,” said Jami Derry of East Palestine, who has put up the&nbsp;“Justice for Trouble” page on Facebook with her friend, Dianna Elzer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than $2,000 was donated in a single day, including cash deposited in collection cans put out around town by Ms. Derry.</p>
<p>“We’re still counting” including checks people say they will be mailing to a designated bank account or to the Columbiana County Humane Society, she said.</p>
<p>The Justice for Trouble page has reached over 50,000 people on Facebook and posts have been widely shared by people all over the country, Ms. Derry said.</p>
<p>If no one steps up with enough information to qualify for the reward, Ms. Derry said donations will ultimately be given to the Humane Society, whose shelter is located in Salem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trouble&nbsp;“was tortured, brutally murdered ... and her partial remains were put back in her yard on Jan. 5,” according to the news release posted on the&nbsp;“City of East Palestine, Ohio” Facebook page.</p>
<p>Barbara Greaves told police on Friday that her beagle named Trouble was missing from her backyard in the 100 block of East North Avenue. Trouble had been out for about an hour on a&nbsp;“cable run.”</p>
<p>On Sunday her son, Scott Greaves found the dog’s head in the yard.</p>
<p>“I heard about this on social media and I couldn’t sleep,” said Ms. Derry, who reached out to the Greaves family about setting up the Justice page on Facebook.</p>
<p>Family members are too sad and too upset to talk to reporters, Ms. Derry said, but updates about the case will be posted on Justice for Trouble.</p>
<p>The humane agent for the Columbiana County Humane Society is helping East Palestine police with the investigation, said Rick Eyler, executive director at the shelter that currently has three dogs and 14 cats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Why did this happen?” is an important question in the investigation, Mr. Eyler said. There is no rash of dogs disappearing in the town located just over the state line from Chippewa, Beaver County. There is no indication that Trouble barked excessively or engaged in any other behaviors that would have angered some one, he said.</p>
<p>Police are asking that people with information should call them at 330-426-4341.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donations can be mailed to Home Savings &amp; Loan Bank, 127 N. Market St., East Palestine, Ohio 44413. Checks should be made out to Justice for Trouble.</p>
