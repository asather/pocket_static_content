<h1>Prep schools offer basketball recruits chance to gain development advantage</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Toby Okani arrived at St. Benedict's in Newark, N.J., he expected non-stop basketball. That’s why he chose to attend the college preparatory school for his senior year, leaving West Orange High School behind after three seasons.</p>
<p>He figured he’d be in the gym from dawn till dusk, dribbling and shooting and competing against other high-end players. Perhaps there would be a few trips to the weight room mixed in. Maybe they’d study playbooks and concepts. It would be basketball, though. All basketball.</p>
<p>Not yoga mats. Not swimming pools.</p>
<p>Okani didn’t think those off-the-court workout routines would be part of the arrangement — at least, not so heavily involved. Yet there he was, each day during summer workouts and early into the school year, exercising in the pool or on the mat.</p>
<p>“What does this help?” Okani initially thought. “Why am I doing this?”</p>
<p>But as Okani looks back on what made the first of his two prep school stops special, he realizes how those pool workouts and yoga sessions shaped him into the player he is now. His growing pains started to cease. He began to fill out his 6-foot-7 frame.</p>
<p>The offers from Division I programs soon followed, and now he’s joining a 2020 recruiting class at Duquesne that includes three other players who also opted for post-graduate seasons before making the jump to college basketball.</p>
<p>He played plenty of basketball at St. Benedict’s and Cushing Academy in Ashburnham, Mass., where he completed a post-graduate year. But the time on the court wasn’t the only distinguishing factor of those schools.</p>
<p>And Okani’s experience isn’t unique for players at Pittsburgh-area programs. Robert Morris and Pitt both had six former prep school prospects on its roster last season, and Duquesne added five more in its incoming class.</p>
<p>Particularly for those who are under the radar, undersized or young for their age, the prep school route — be it as a post-graduate or earlier — offers prospects a different way to develop in an environment that straddles the line between high school and college.</p>
<p>While there aren’t many talent-based scholarships, need-based aid is available, particularly with tuition rising to $85,000 at certain programs. Prep schools, often in a boarding environment, aren’t limited to basketball prospects, either. But with an increasing number popping up around the country, the visibility — and subsequent interest — has only increased.</p>
<p>Boiled down, prep school basketball takes players who aren’t ready for college and turns them into players who are.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to prepare these guys for whatever comes to them at the next level,” said Chris Chaney, head basketball coach at Scotland Campus, a prep school in Scotland, Pa. “Being away from home, playing for a new coach, playing in a new system, playing with other new players [is] basically what they’re going to do at the college level.</p>
<p>“By doing that with us,” Chaney continued, “they can go through their growing pains and learn how to figure some stuff out.”</p>
<p>Terell Strickland didn’t see the loose ball underneath the basket, not until he rose up, laid his ball off the backboard and landed on the stray one with a snap of his ankle.</p>
<p>Even then, he tried to play it off. He had a new coach, new teammates and a new environment. So in his first practice with Scotland Campus, the post-graduate played through his broken ankle anyway, wanting to prove his toughness and his worth.</p>
<p>“I can’t come in here looking weak,” Strickland thought at the time. “I can’t get hurt on the first day; what would I look like?”</p>
<p>Strickland, the son of longtime NBA point guard Rod Strickland, always had his dad to push him in basketball if his own motivation was lacking. But away from home and without friends around, Strickland needed to grow up quickly, finding his own drive to go to rehab and return from a major injury setback early in what was supposed to be a standout year for colleges to view him.</p>
<p>He rose to the occasion.</p>
<p>“He just kept fighting and fighting and working to get back to where he needed to get to,” said Chaney, Strickland’s coach at Scotland Campus. “But once that happened, he was better than ever. The best thing about that is, now, when he goes to college, he’s going to James Madison, he’s going to be ready for whatever comes to him.”</p>
<p>While developing players’ raw basketball skills can be a major draw toward prep schools, one of the biggest selling points is the other side of the game — learning how to adapt to new situations on the fly.</p>
<p>For Strickland, it was overcoming that broken ankle and working his way into the lineup upon his return. For Okani, that meant learning plays for positions 1 through 4, mastering a full playbook modeled around a college scheme. For Pitt’s Abdoul Karim Coulibaly, another Scotland Campus product, it came down to earning his coach’s trust.</p>
<p>But for all of them, heading to prep school involves quick adaptation, a key lesson before heading to a bigger stage of basketball.</p>
<p>“This is preparing kids for college,” said Damien Williams, head basketball coach at The Kiski School in Saltsburg. “Once you get to college, they know. They’re like, ‘I’ve gone through this already.’”</p>
<p>Okani had played against talented players before on the AAU circuit, guys ranked in ESPN’s top 100 with more Division I offers than they could count. Those matchups would last until the final buzzer sounded, though. Then they’d part, and Okani could go on his way, flushing a loss or replaying a win.</p>
<p>But not Bensley Joseph. He just couldn’t get away from him, not when each day in practice Okani lined up opposite the four-star prospect at Cushing Academy last season.</p>
<p>“He’s my teammate, of course,” Okani said, “but we still had to go at it.”</p>
<p>That meant, as a 6-foot-7 small forward, figuring out ways to stop an “explosive” guard six inches shorter than Okani. It showed Okani how to use his size, keeping Joseph on his hip as he dribbled. He became a better ballhandler, and he learned he could afford to play defense a step further back than normal on Joseph because his reach made up the difference.</p>
<p>He discovered all of that in practice. It’s an added benefit of attending a prep school for basketball.</p>
<p>“I’m going to get a better education, I’m going to have better development and practice every day, just because my teammates are going to be better,” said Cory Heitz, a prep school basketball consultant who helps match players with programs.</p>
<p>Sure, the games are full of talented players at some of the top teams in the country. But for that full season, players can’t escape the rigorous practice schedule — or the gifted teammates they face — acclimating them to what’s ahead in college.</p>
<p>“They play good competition, they play with good players every day,” Duquesne head coach Keith Dambrot said. “That’s probably the biggest thing.”</p>
<p>Damien Williams has a routine.</p>
<p>Every Monday during the season, the Kiski School head coach updates the film for each of his players. Then he contacts college coaches at programs his players are interested in, sending out those highlight tapes and the team’s schedule to get the maximum exposure possible.</p>
<p>Williams isn’t just a basketball coach. He’s an advocate for his players, assisting in the recruiting process to ensure they’re noticed and given an opportunity.</p>
<p>“I love talking to coaches about players and how my guys can help their programs out, but a lot of that’s on me,” Williams said. “I have to do the work.”</p>
<p>As prep schools gain visibility through marquee tournaments — such as the Spalding Hoophall Classic, which has games featured on ESPN — getting the word out about players has gotten easier. One good weekend in front of a large cast of college coaches can change the complexion of a players’ recruiting landscape.</p>
<p>Take Jett Roesing, for example. The former First Love Christian Academy star played in the 2019 Mid-Atlantic Independent School Shootout in New Jersey, and a week later he picked up offers from six Division I schools before deciding on Duquesne.</p>
<p>Strickland opted for a post-graduate year because he was stuck behind his brother, Tai, and Serrel Smith for most of his time in high school — players who went to Wisconsin and Maryland, respectively. Heading to Scotland Campus allowed him to be “more free and open.”</p>
<p>And there’s Mike Bekelja, who originally committed to Fairmont State before doing a U-turn after his coach left the Division II program. So he instead enrolled at International Sports Academy in Ohio as a post-grad, and now he’s set to join Dambrot at Duquesne.</p>
<p>Some of the most valuable moments were the open gym sessions, Bekelja said, when coaches could watch him scrimmage against highly ranked recruits. It can make it easier for college coaches to scout more players. But with more eyes, challenges arise for certain programs.</p>
<p>“Whenever there’s a lot of good players in one spot, there’s a lot of coaches in one spot,” Dambrot said. “I do my best recruiting when there’s only one guy sitting there. And that’s me.”</p>
<p>As uncertainty reigns supreme during the coronavirus pandemic — and a dead period for in-person recruiting hangs over college basketball through the end of August — players who haven’t already signed this late in the game have only a few options left.</p>
<p>They could attend one of the schools that’s already accepted them, for basketball or otherwise. They could also attend a junior college, but Heitz — the prep school consultant — said most junior colleges prefer to see a player in person first. Or a player could pursue a post-graduate year.</p>
<p>Heitz said the latter option seems to be most popular this year, with over 200 families reaching out to him looking for placement. But it’s not without challenges of its own.</p>
<p>“Roster spots are almost all full and financial aid is limited, if any,” Heitz wrote in a text message. “Rise in interest has been [the] highest ever from [the] class of 2020 due to [the] dead period. Kids are still reaching out to me daily. A lot have waited too long.”</p>
<p>For those who haven’t waited too long, opting for a year or more at a prep school can open doors — to physical development, increased exposure and heightened competition.</p>
<p>And for a player who isn’t ready for the rise in level just yet, a prep school can change that. Dambrot is seeing that with his incoming recruiting class at Duquesne, with four post-graduates highlighting the group.</p>
<p>“They’ve played a lot of games. They’re a year older physically, more mature, they’ve been in situations where they haven’t been spoiled,” Dambrot said. “All that comes into play; I like that.”</p>
