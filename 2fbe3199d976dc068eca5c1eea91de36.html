<h1>Eagle egg hatches in Hays</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Clearly involved in a "life-sustaining" business, the bald eagle nest in Hays has remained fully operational since the hatching this morning of Pittsburgh's first eaglet of 2020.</p>
<p>It took nearly 20 hours for the tiny bird to peck through its shell, with the first pip appearring at about 12:30 p.m. Friday.</p>
<p>"The female was on the egg when it hatched," said Rachel Handel, spokeswoman for the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania. "Prior to the actual hatch taking place, she could be seen listening to the sounds coming from the egg and frequently repositioning herself on the nest."</p>
<p>The eaglet finally tumbled out of the egg at 7:40 a.m., visible on live-streaming video provided by CSE of Monroeville and Audubon. View the nest at <a href="/aswp.org" target="_blank">aswp.org</a>.</p>
<p>"Right now, the eaglet is still rather wobbly," said Ms. Handel. "The parents will soon begin to feed it by breaking up food -- likely fish, based on what they’ve been bringing into the nest -- into pieces small enough for the eaglet to consume."</p>
<p>Having experienced bird-rearing 10 previous times since setting up residency in Hays in 2013, the parents are particularly attentive to the eaglet and its sibling still inside an egg, which the parents continue to roll and incubate. It is expected to hatch Sunday or Monday.</p>
<p>With schools closed, Audubon is creating educational videos that parents and teachers can share to keep children engaged in nature studies. The videos will be posted at the Audubon chapter's website and Facebook page.</p>
<p>Ms. Handel said the number of people viewing the webcam has increased.</p>
<p>"It’s gratifying when people let us know that they’re watching the cam and sharing the experience with their kids," she said. "With the eaglet now hatched, it’s really very appealing to kids with its very fluffy grey downy feathers. There’s much more to see going on in the nest."</p>
