<h1>State releases complaint form for businesses not following COVID-19 requirements</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you have walked into a local business lately and have been dismayed by the lack of health-and-safety protocols being followed, now you can do something about it.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health recently put out an online <a href="https://expressforms.pa.gov/apps/pa/doh/covid-19-complaint" target="_blank">COVID-19 complaint form</a> where folks can report businesses that are ignoring the regulations that have been imposed on them due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>To file a formal complaint, you have to provide your contact information, that of the business you are reporting, what type of business it is, your relationship to the business, the “public health complaint” that prompted your use of this form and answer a few other questions before submitting it for the state to look over.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The types of complaints listed on the form include social distancing not being practiced, sick employees, equipment not being properly sanitized, employers not “providing or allowing” masks to be worn and the business generally “not creating a safe environment for customers,” among other options.</p>
<p>Since Allegheny County officially moved into the green phase of reopening a few weeks ago, many businesses have been allowed to reopen their doors to the public, who have been <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/dining/2020/06/28/Green-phase-dine-in-restaurants-Westmoreland-Beaver-Butler-Allegheny-Washington/stories/202006260066" target="_blank">slowly trickling</a> back into storefronts. Masks are still <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-masks-are-mandatory-in-pennsylvania-businesses/" target="_blank">required to be worn</a> in all businesses statewide, per an order from Gov. Tom Wolf’s office.</p>
<p>“The importance of mask-wearing to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect people and businesses cannot be overstated,” Mr. Wolf said Friday via a news release.</p>
<p>The green phase has coincided with a countywide increase in COVID-19 cases. The county’s health department <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/06/28/covid-19-coronavirus-allegheny-county-western-pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-32/stories/202006280096" target="_blank">reported 96 new cases</a> on Sunday, a new single-day record that tops the previous high of 90 set just a day earlier. The highest number of reported cases before this weekend was the 76 reported on April 4.</p>
<p>Sunday’s total number of reported new cases was also the first time Allegheny County led the state of Pennsylvania in that category. In response to that spike in cases, county Executive Rich Fitzgerald announced on Sunday that Allegheny County bars will be forced to shut down Tuesday.</p>
