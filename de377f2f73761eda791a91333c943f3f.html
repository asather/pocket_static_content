<h1>Allegheny County now has 10 COVID-19 cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The total number of cases of COVID-19 infection in Allegheny County jumped to 10 Tuesday after the Allegheny County Health Department reported four new cases.</p>
<p>Three of the cases are considered&nbsp;“presumed” because they were tested at a new lab and the results have not been retested yet to confirm the result. All three of those cases are young adults over 18 who are now in isolation in their homes, the county said.</p>
<p>Two of those young adults contracted COVID-19 through recent international travel, and one through recent domestic travel, the county said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the cases is&nbsp;“confirmed,” meaning it does not have to be checked again by another lab.</p>
<p>The confirmed case is a person in his or her 60s who is now hospitalized. The county does not yet know how that person contracted COVID-19.</p>
<p>The presumed cases could have been tested using UPMC’s new COVID-19 test, which may have begun as early as Monday at a testing site on the South Side. UPMC would not answer questions about the lab Tuesday or the test site, which got up and running formally on Tuesday.</p>
<p>New tests have to have their first five positive and first five negative tests checked by another lab, whether it’s the state lab in Exton, Pa., or some other lab that is already up and running, said Nate Wardle, spokesman for the state Department of Health.</p>
<p>The county said the “presumed” label from this new lab “will be dropped as soon as the lab meets necessary requirements” and future positive test results could be immediately considered&nbsp;“confirmed.”</p>
<p>Seven of the county’s 10 cases have been listed as&nbsp;“confirmed.” The three “presumed” cases reported today are the only ones now listed as such.</p>
<p>The four new cases come just three days after the first case was reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The county did not provide any information on who has tested positive in the four new cases.</p>
<p>“The contact tracing, including information gathering, is just underway on these cases,” the county said in a press release. “As a result, no further information is available at this time.”</p>
<p>In addition to the 10 cases in Allegheny County, Washington and Beaver counties also have one COVID-19 case each.</p>
