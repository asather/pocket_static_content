<h1>Jake DiMichele leads OLSH to win over Sto-Rox and WPIAL 2A title</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jake DiMichele knows all about Sto-Rox’s rich basketball history.</p>
<p>His dad, Daren, was a 1,000-point scorer at the school and played on Sto-Rox’s undefeated PIAA championship team in 1983. He’s had cousins star there, among them Adam, who helped the Vikings win their most-recent WPIAL championship in 2002.</p>
<p>Friday, a DiMichele won another title. Although this one came at Sto-Rox’s expense.</p>
<p>Jake DiMichele scored a game-high 30 points to lead Our Lady of the Sacred Heart to its second consecutive WPIAL Class 2A title with an 81-72 win against Sto-Rox at Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>Matt Rees added 14 points and Dante Spadafora and B.J. Vaughn chipped in 13 points each for OLSH (24-1), a small Catholic school in Coraopolis which won its 14th game in a row. A.J. Nelson led Sto-Rox (18-7) with 19 points. The Vikings saw their 15-game win streak snapped.</p>
<p>This was a special afternoon for DiMichele, a sophomore guard and the WPIAL’s third-leading scorer at 29 points a game. DiMichele lives in McKees Rocks and has many ties to this Sto-Rox team. Sto-Rox coach Ryan Hughes used to be his baseball coach. Assistant coach Gary Drexler is one of his dad’s best friends. He has known a few of their players since he was very young.</p>
<p>“We played [in the semifinals] at 6:15 on Tuesday. Sto-Rox played at 8. As soon as I got home, everyone texted me,” DiMichele said, smiling. “I wanted to play Sto-Rox. I didn’t want to play Shenango again. In the days leading up to the game, everyone was hyping it up that a DiMichele isn’t playing for Sto-Rox, he’s playing against them.”</p>
<p>For about a quarter, it looked like Sto-Rox might be the ones celebrating. Sto-Rox took it to OLSH early, outscoring the Chargers, 20-12, in the first quarter before scoring the first bucket of the second quarter to go up by 10. This was a strange start considering OLSH is the second-highest scoring team in the WPIAL and Sto-Rox had to rally from double-digit halftime deficits in its previous two playoff games.</p>
<p>“I think we had the jitters to start,” OLSH coach Mike Rodriguez said. “We were missing open shots. We were missing layups. I think when we calmed down and got into the flow of the game.”</p>
<p>And flow they did. OLSH scored 29 points over the final 7:19 of the second quarter. That included a 9-0 run in which DiMichele scored seven points. DiMichele had 11 points in the quarter, which also saw Vaughn, a freshman, come off the bench and hit two 3-pointers in the final minute. That allowed the Chargers to take a 34-31 halftime lead.</p>
<p>It was more of the same in the third quarter when OLSH took its first double-digit lead on a DiMichele 3-pointer that gave the Chargers a 52-41 advantage midway through the quarter. Sto-Rox got no closer than eight points the rest of the game.</p>
<p>Sto-Rox shot 51 percent (26 of 51) from the field, but was done in by 25 turnovers and 30 fouls. Starters Malik Smith and Jamil Williams each fouled out.</p>
<p>“The game plan going in was to get the ball out of Spadafora’s and DiMichele’s hands,” Hughes said. “I thought we were really doing a good job in the first quarter. That’s why I thought we were up double figures. Once we had to change things around a little bit, they got a couple of open shots and that gave them some confidence. The foul trouble killed us.”</p>
<p>DiMichele did, too. He was 9 of 18 from the field (3 of 5 from 3-point range) and 9 of 11 from the free-throw line.</p>
<p>For DiMichele, a McKees Rocks kid through and through, sharing the big stage with Sto-Rox was a big deal.</p>
<p>“It was special to see how far we’ve come. Not just me, but everyone on Sto, too,” he said. “I remember them when they were really young. Who would think some guys from McKees Rocks would be playing on the court at the Pete one day? It’s a great feeling.”</p>
