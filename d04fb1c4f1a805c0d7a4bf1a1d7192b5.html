<h1>Nazi-obsessed felon admits to illegal gun purchase with retired judge</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dennis Alan Riggs, a felon whom the FBI fears is a potential mass shooter, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/12/Troy-Hill-felon-Dennis-Alan-Riggs-Nazi-obsessed-to-plead-guilty-AR-15-Karl-Alexander/stories/202005120094" target="_blank">waived indictment and pleaded guilty</a> by video on Wednesday to a federal gun possession charge that will land him in prison.</p>
<p>Riggs, 50, of Troy Hill, isn't allowed to have guns but had his partner, a retired Social Security administrative law judge, buy an AR-15 for him.</p>
<p>The 79-year-old judge, Karl Alexander of Grove City, has also pleaded guilty to acting as a straw buyer and is now also a federal felon.</p>
<p>He said Riggs, his boyfriend since 1997, had been asking him for years to buy the assault weapon for him. He didn't because he was still a judge, but after he retired finally agreed.</p>
<p>The two of them went together to Ace Sporting Goods in Washington County on Sept. 29, 2018, where Riggs picked out the weapon and Alexander bought it after lying on a required federal firearms form.</p>
<p>Alexander told the FBI that he knew the purchase was wrong and said he warned Riggs that it was a "bad idea," according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Lieber Smolar, but he did it anyway because of their relationship.</p>
<p>Riggs was convicted in 1994 of aggravated assault.</p>
<p>The FBI's terrorism unit raided his house on Jan. 22.</p>
<p>They found the AR-15, six other guns, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, knives, daggers and hundreds of bottles of alcohol.</p>
<p>The house was also filled with Nazi banners, flags and pictures of Hitler in almost every room.</p>
<p>On his phone, agents found images of swastikas, Hitler, Nazi pornography, contact information for South Carolina mass shooter Dylann Roof and the Facebook Livestream video of the 2019 mosque massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand.</p>
<p>Both Riggs and Alexander were present during the raid and gave statements to the FBI that they knew Riggs was a felon.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Robert Colville said he'd sentence Riggs in September.</p>
