<h1>Episcopal Bishop McConnell postpones retirement</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Bishop Dorsey McConnell of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh has postponed his retirement from April to September 2021 to provide a continuity of leadership as the church copes with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and to allow more time for the diocese to find a successor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Bishop McConnell announced the postponement in a statement Thursday “due to the extraordinary circumstances brought on by pandemic.”</span></p>
<p>The typical search process for a successor involves meetings within the diocese and travel by candidates for the position.</p>
<p>“We don’t know how long we will be unable to meet together due to the pandemic, nor can we foresee the full impact on our parishes of the economic and personal stresses we will likely be experiencing for some time to come,” Bishop McConnell wrote. “Extending my tenure by a few months will allow some continuity of pastoral care as we all try to get back on our feet once the worst has past.”</p>
<p>Bishop McConnell, who announced his intention to retire in December, has led the diocese since 2012.</p>
