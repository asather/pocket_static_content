<h1>Cuomo laments delays in testing as number of confirmed coronavirus cases in N.Y. tops 100</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized the federal government on Sunday for delays in allowing private laboratories in New York State to test for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>At a news conference, Mr. Cuomo also announced 16 new confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the total number in New York State to 106. But he said that the state would not know the full extent of the spread until it could do more testing.</p>
<p>“I would get nervous if the number didn’t go up,” he said. He added: “The more tests we run, the better.” In his most pointed criticism to date, Mr. Cuomo said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been slow in responding to the epidemic and then too slow in allowing states to do more testing.</p>
<p>His criticism came as Scarsdale, a New York City suburb in Westchester County, announced that it would close schools from Monday through March 18 after a faculty member at the district’s middle school tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>And Columbia University announced Sunday night that it would suspend classes for Monday and Tuesday because a member of the Columbia community was quarantined after being exposed to the virus. No one at the university has tested positive for the virus, Columbia said in its statement.</p>
<p>In Scarsdale, the district, which serves 4,800 students, said in a statement on its website that it acted “in an abundance of caution” after consulting with the county health commissioner. Although two small Westchester districts closed for two days last week, the eight-day shuttering of Scarsdale schools represents the most significant districtwide shutdown so far.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuomo, speaking at the Northwell Health Labs at the Center for Advanced Medicine, a private laboratory in North New Hyde Park, on Long Island, said seven labs in the state could begin testing immediately for the coronavirus if given federal approval.</p>
<p>“The CDC has not authorized the use of this lab, which is just outrageous and ludicrous,” he said of Northwell. “CDC, wake up, let the states test, let private labs test, let’s increase as quickly as possible our testing capacity so we can identify the positive people. Not to be using this laboratory, not to be using the other private labs around the state makes no sense whatsoever.”</p>
<p>When asked why the labs had not gotten approval, Mr. Cuomo said, “I think it’s bureaucracy.”</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, the governor announced that Northwell had received approval to test under an emergency use authorization that will allow it to handle about 75 to 80 samples a day.</p>
<p>Once the lab is able to automate the process, moving away from manual testing, it could eventually raise capacity to thousands a day, Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.</p>
<p>On Friday, Michelle Forman, a spokeswoman for the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said the agency was not aware of any testing shortages.</p>
<p>Hospital and private laboratory testing would add significantly to the capacity across New York. Since last weekend, the public health laboratories in New York City and Albany have been able to test for the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>Yet testing remained limited: As of Saturday only about 120 people in New York City had been tested for the virus. And it has been become clear that the new coronavirus was spreading faster than testing was increasing.</p>
<p>In New York City cases are emerging of people who seemed to have been infected locally. They had no known contact with previously identified coronavirus patients, nor any travel to places with widespread transmission.</p>
<p>By Friday, city officials had issued an urgent plea to the federal government for more testing supplies, saying that the city’s limited capacity to test had “impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic.” City officials said they had only been given enough supplies from the federal government to test about 1,000 people.</p>
<p>By the following morning, their request had been answered. On Saturday, New York City’s public health laboratory had received more tests. “This morning, the N.Y.C. Public Health Lab received 23,000 tests and declined offers for additional shipments,” a federal Heath and Human Services spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The 106 cases across the state include 13 in New York City; five in Nassau County; two in Rockland County; two in Saratoga County; and one each in Suffolk and Ulster counties. Westchester County, the epicenter of the epidemic in New York, now has 82 cases, up from 70 on Saturday.</p>
<p>At a separate news conference on Sunday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a new case, a Bronx resident, raising the number of cases in the city to 13. Officials are prepared to see “hundreds” of cases in the next several weeks, mostly through community spread, he said.</p>
<p>In an effort to aid the local economy, Mr. de Blasio said small businesses that had fewer than 100 employees were eligible for no-interest loans of up to $75,000 if they could document that sales had decreased by 25 percent. Businesses with fewer than five employees were now eligible for grants up to $6,000 to retain employees, the mayor said.</p>
<p>The mayor said the city was canceling all international trips for public schools, not just travel to the most affected countries.</p>
<p>He said the city will add 85 nurses to city schools throughout the week, so that every school building has a nurse. After reports that some public schools did not have enough soap and other cleaning products, the city will make spot checks to ensure that schools have enough materials, he added.</p>
<p>The education department will also help local private, religious and charter schools with cleaning supplies, the mayor said. So far, 132 Catholic schools, 59 Jewish schools and one charter organization with multiple schools have asked for help and are expected to receive their supplies on Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. de Blasio urged employers to stagger work hours for employees and allow people to telecommute if possible. If workers have to use public transit at busy times, he urged New Yorkers to avoid crowded subway cars and wait for the next train if one is full.</p>
<p>“We’ve all been sardines in the subway,” Mr. de Blasio said. “If you have the option of walking or biking to work, please do that.”</p>
<p>City officials said coronavirus spreads when viral droplets directly enter a person’s mouth, nose or eyes. The virus does not linger for long periods of time on surfaces like metal subway poles or seats, they said. “It’s only a matter of minutes before the disease dies in the open air,” Mr. de Blasio said. “This is a disease that requires a very direct level of contact.”</p>
<p>Nineteen people were under mandatory quarantine, meaning they could be fined if they violated the order, the mayor said. Additionally, 2,176 people in the city were under self-quarantine.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Mr. Cuomo declared a state of emergency, which allows the state to respond more quickly by lifting regulations.</p>
<p>The state would be able to speed up purchasing supplies and hiring workers to assist local health departments that have been monitoring of thousands of self-quarantined patients, Mr. Cuomo said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Separately, health officials in New Jersey also reported two additional cases on Sunday, a 70-year-old health care worker from Teaneck and a 32-year-old man from West New York, bringing the number of cases in the state to six. Both men had begun to show symptoms on Feb. 28, according to state officials.</p>
<p>“As you can see, from north to south, the coronavirus seems to be spreading,” said Judith Persichilli, the state’s health commissioner.</p>
<p>The 70-year-old male health worker was admitted to the hospital on Friday. He is in stable condition but remained in intensive care, health officials said.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old, from West New York, was admitted to the hospital on Thursday, they added.</p>
<p>The officials also updated the case of another 32-year-old patient, a doctor from Fort Lee who was New Jersey’s first coronavirus case. They said the doctor had attended a medical conference, run by Empire Medical Training, at a Westin Hotel in Times Square from Feb. 28 to March 2.</p>
<p>Representatives for Empire Medical and the Westin could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>In total, New Jersey officials said, 27 individuals were being tracked in nine counties, including Sussex and Camden, which are at separate ends of the state.</p>
<p>Also on Sunday, Connecticut reported its first case of coronavirus involving a resident, a 40-to-50 year old from Wilton, who was most likely infected with the virus during a recent trip to California, Gov. Ned Lamont said in a statement.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Mr. Lamont said a New York doctor who commutes to work at Bridgeport Hospital tested positive for the coronavirus. Mr. Lamont said the physician did not show visible symptoms while treating patients and isolated himself.</p>
<p>In the United States, as of Sunday morning, more than 400 people have been treated for coronavirus in 32 states and Washington, according to a New York Times database, and at least 19 people have died.</p>
<p>In New York, the Westchester cases were mostly, if not all, related to a cluster that first came to the authorities’ attention after Lawrence Garbuz, 50, a lawyer who lives in New Rochelle, was confirmed as New York’s second coronavirus patient.</p>
<p>His wife, Adina Lewis Garbuz, said in a Facebook post on Friday that her husband remained in critical condition, but she was hopeful that he would recover. No one else in the family has symptoms beyond a cough, she said.</p>
<p>“I would also like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of you for the outpouring of love from literally around the world and in particular members of my community who in their own way, many but not all of whom are under quarantine, are living this surreal life with us,” she wrote. “We have wonderful friends who have cared for us despite the running fears all around us.”</p>
