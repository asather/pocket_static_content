<h1>Wake held for Jefferson Hills officer killed in head-on crash</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A steady stream of people moved in and out of the Jefferson Hills Municipal Complex and Library Friday to pay their respects and visit with the family of Dale T. Provins Jr.</p>
<p>The 15-year Jefferson Hills police officer and U.S. Marine Corps veteran died June 13 from injuries sustained in a head-on crash June 3 with a vehicle that crossed the center line and struck his patrol vehicle, according to the borough website. His father and uncle also worked at the same station. Family members and fellow officers described the 50-year-old as a kind, reserved person who cared about people.</p>
<p>“He was my hero,” said his younger half brother Peter Sparico, 46, of Belle Vernon. “I looked up to him.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sparico said Officer Provins didn’t talk about being a police officer outside of work because he was very private. But he was also kind and would occasionally take Mr. Sparico and their mom out to dinner.</p>
<p>“We grew up together, played sports together,” Mr. Sparico said. “He was an active guy.”</p>
<p>Scott Welsh, a retired Jefferson Hills police officer, worked at the department for 25 years, nine of them with Officer Provins.</p>
<p>“We’ve been through so much together,” Officer Welsh said. “Sometimes he played jokes on people.”</p>
<p>He described the police as a “family of blue.” He said that when an officer is killed in the line of duty like this, other departments will come from across state lines to show support.</p>
<p>The officers from Pleasant Hills and Jefferson Hills work closely together because their neighborhoods are close together. Jefferson Hills officers could not be reached for comment, but many officers from Pleasant Hills and other departments were there to pay their respects and help direct traffic.</p>
<p>“Dale was a very kind and gentle soul,” said Officer Ronald Porupsky of Pleasant Hills. “He was taken too soon.”</p>
<p>Pleasant Hills police Chief Brian Finnerty remembers when Officer Provins came on the police force. Although they never worked together directly, they took some calls together.</p>
<p>“He was a better human being than he was a policeman,” Chief Finnerty said.</p>
<p>Clairton police Officer Dwayne Beere has been at the department for four years and described the police as a “brotherhood.” He and other officers from the department volunteered to be at the wake in case of emergencies and to help direct traffic.</p>
<p>“The brotherhood comes together,” Officer Beere said of the local police departments. “You don’t see it much unless something happens, but we support each other.”</p>
<p>There will be a graveside service at Round Hill Cemetery in Elizabeth Township on Saturday at 11 a.m. Officer Provins is survived by his daughter, fiancee, parents and siblings.</p>
