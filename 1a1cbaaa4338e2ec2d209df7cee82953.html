<h1>Pennsylvania will take part in multi-state investigation of Juul</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two weeks after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/02/10/Juul-Pennsylvania-sues-ecigarette-marketing-teens/stories/202002100131" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro sued Juul</a>, the dominant producer of vaping products in the U.S., his office announced that the state will also take part in a bipartisan, 39-state investigation into Juul’s marketing and sales practices in an attempt to “ramp up the pressure” on the San Francisco-based company.</p>
<p>“When I visited Radnor High School students earlier this month to announce my lawsuit against Juul Labs, I heard firsthand how this company’s target demographic has been shaken by deceitful marketing practices and potentially dangerous products,” Mr. Shapiro said in a press release.</p>
<p>“I have no doubt we will be successful in our court action, but there is power in numbers and Juul must be held accountable by Pennsylvania and by every state that is part of this coalition.”</p>
<p>The press release said the multi-state coalition will look into Juul’s claims regarding nicotine content, and its “statements regarding risks, safety and effectiveness as a smoking cessation device.”</p>
<p>Those practices were part of the six-count civil lawsuit Pennsylvania filed against Juul, which made it the seventh of eight states —&nbsp;Massachusetts sued Juul the day after Pennsylvania —&nbsp;to sue the 5-year-old company that controls about 75% of the vaping product market.</p>
<p>Arizona, California, North Carolina, Illinois, Minnesota and New York are the six other states that have sued Juul, joining schools districts, counties and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>In press releases from other states, state attorney generals in&nbsp;Connecticut, Florida, Nevada, Oregon and Texas say they will lead the investigation. Based on news stories from around the country, some of the other states among the 39 participating in the investigation are&nbsp;Kansas, Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Michigan, though a complete list was not provided because some states do not openly discuss whether they are doing investigations.</p>
<p>In the Pennsylvania press release, Mr. Shapiro noted:&nbsp;“While traditional cigarette use has plummeted among youth for decades, vaping is skyrocketing and is undermining national progress toward reducing tobacco use.”</p>
<p>He cited a survey conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control in 2019 that found more than 5 million youth had reported having used e-cigarettes within the past 30 days, up from 3.6 million just one year ago.</p>
