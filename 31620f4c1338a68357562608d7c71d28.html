<h1>Riverhounds enter regular-season finale with playoff positioning at stake</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the minutes after Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC’s loss last Saturday against Hartford Athletic, coach Bob Lilley gathered his team around him near midfield of Highmark Stadium.</p>
<p>He didn’t hold back.</p>
<p>“I was not pleased after the game,” he said with a laugh Wednesday, far enough removed from the anger he felt in that moment. “I got on them pretty good.”</p>
<p>With the 1-0 setback, the Riverhounds lost more than just a match; they squandered a chance to clinch first place in their group and host a first-round match in the USL Championship playoffs. Because of that, their fight for those rewards continues.</p>
<p>The Riverhounds wrap up their regular season Saturday with a match against Philadelphia Union II. The club clinched a playoff berth nearly a month ago, but it enters Saturday’s matchup trailing Hartford by one point in the group standings, with both teams having just one match left to play.</p>
<p>Whatever sense of comfort the club’s players and coaches may have once felt while they were atop the table is now gone, but they’re well aware their goals are still within reach — even if grabbing them isn’t entirely in their control.</p>
<p>“I think we all knew, not just the players, that we kind of gave something back,” Lilley said. “We desperately didn’t want to open the door for them. There’s also a recognition that we have to go about our business this week. We are in the playoffs and we have important games coming up. We have a chance to put things right.”</p>
<p>The loss to Hartford snapped a five-match win streak and ended a run of 517 consecutive minutes in which they hadn’t allowed a goal. Most notably, it shifted their playoff outlook, temporarily placing them in a less desirable position.</p>
<p>If the Riverhounds finish first in their group — which they would get with a win and a Hartford loss against New York Red Bulls II, a tie and a Hartford loss or a win and a Hartford tie — they would stay at home for at least their first playoff match and get a decidedly easier opponent, either Indy Eleven or Saint Louis FC (with 23 and 22 points, respectively, compared to the Riverhounds’ 31). Should they finish in second, they’ll have to travel to Louisville City FC, which they beat, 3-1, in the season opener. Louisville, however, is on a 10-match unbeaten streak, and while a road match during a pandemic usually presents the visitor with only the hassles of traveling, Louisville has been hosting nearly 5,000 fans for home contests, making for a slightly more difficult environment for opponents.</p>
<p>In all, the difference between first and second in the group is sizable.</p>
<p>“This can’t be a hangover,” Lilley said. “It may mean a few more road games in the playoffs, but our job is to win this weekend and do the best we can to get ready for the first week of the playoffs, whether we’re home or away. We just have to know we’re good enough to beat anyone.”</p>
<p>The Riverhounds’ position was made all the more precarious Wednesday when Hartford won at Philadelphia in the 90th minute when Danny Barrera stuck out his leg as Philadelphia’s keeper attempted to throw the ball from the box to a teammate, a throwaway gesture that, in this case, deflected the ball back and into the net in one of the more bizarre goals seen at any level of professional soccer.</p>
<p>That unusual sequence of events made last Saturday’s loss hurt that much more. The Riverhounds, despite the result, controlled the match. They maintained possession for 73.9% of the match. They held an 8-1 advantage in shots on target and had 23 open play crosses and eight corner kicks, compared to just four and two, respectively, for Hartford.</p>
<p>Even as Lilley decried his team’s lack of sharpness, describing their play as “mediocre,” he has whatever reassurance there is knowing the Riverhounds were, in many ways, the better side. Because of that, he doesn’t anticipate widespread, wholesale alterations to his lineup or rotations — for now, at least.</p>
<p>“If we had a poor performance where I wanted to change a lot of the lineup, I think we’d be out of the playoffs at that point,” Lilley said. “Hopefully we’re not changing a lot and we’re getting on a run here.”</p>
<p>While the Riverhounds’ fate is tied to Hartford, they do head into the weekend with a sense of optimism about their own side. Difficult as last Saturday was, they’ve lost only one of their past eight matches. They’ve trounced Philadelphia in both of their previous matches his season, outscoring it, 10-0, in those meetings. Midfielder Kenardo Forbes, the team’s assist leader and one of its best players, returned last weekend and played 23 minutes after missing nearly a month with a quad injury. Lilley added that Forbes, if he’s ready, will be in the starting lineup Saturday, though as of Wednesday, such a decision hadn’t been made.</p>
<p>Against Hartford, Lilley saw a lack of urgency. On Saturday against Philadelphia, the Riverhounds will need every bit of it.</p>
<p>“It’s disappointing, but looking at the big picture, we’ve grown a lot,” Lilley said. “We’ve bounced back from some tough spots earlier in the year. We need to do that again.”</p>
