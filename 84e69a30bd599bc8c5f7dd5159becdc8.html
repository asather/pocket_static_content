<h1>Pittsburgh firms keep China facilities closed after Lunar New Year due to deadly coronavirus </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh companies with operations in China have closed facilities and instituted travel bans for workers throughout the Asia Pacific as the number of people affected by the deadly coronavirus continues to rise.</p>
<p>A PPG coatings plant in Wuhan, China, closed for the Lunar New Year last month and remains shuttered “to ensure the health and safety of our employees and compliance with government guidelines,” the Downtown-based company said.</p>
<p>Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, is part of a region where the government has imposed a lockdown, curtailed transportation links and set up quarantine shelters.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization reported Thursday that there were 564 deaths and 28,060 confirmed cases of the virus in China. Another 225 cases and one death have been confirmed outside of the country.</p>
<p>PPG’s Wuhan plant, which employs 35, makes automotive coatings.</p>
<p>The company has about 3,800 employees in China at about a dozen manufacturing sites and other administrative and support facilities.</p>
<p>PPG is not aware of any employees infected by the virus, said spokeswoman Greta Edgar.</p>
<p>Like many businesses, PPG has instituted a temporary travel ban for employees in China, in other parts of the Asia Pacific, and for those in other regions who have business in China.</p>
<p>Downtown-based Koppers has two facilities in the country that are also temporarily closed because of the outbreak.</p>
<p>An office in Tianjin and a chemicals plant in Pizhou that together employ about 100 closed Jan. 22 for the Lunar New Year and have not re-opened because of the virus, said company spokeswoman Jessica Franklin.</p>
<p>Koppers has banned travel to and from China and its employees “are encouraged to use discretion when planning any air travel for the foreseeable future,” she said.</p>
<p>Another chemicals firm, Lanxess, which has its North American headquarters in Findlay, said most of its sites in China will remain closed through this week at least.</p>
<p>The German-based business has about 1,500 employees there.</p>
<p>Lanxess hasn’t banned travel to and from China but is “attempting to keep [trips] at an absolute minimum,” said spokesman Michael Mackin.</p>
<p>“Employees are required to check whether the trip is absolutely necessary at this time or if it can be cancelled or postponed,” he said.</p>
<p>Lanxess has ramped up production of a disinfectant product to meet heightened demand in Asia and Europe, the company said.</p>
<p>The product, Rely+On Virkon is used to clean hard surfaces and equipment and has been found effective in reducing contamination of a strain of coronavirus, according to Lanxess.</p>
<p>One of the components of the chemical is produced at a Lanxess plant in Memphis, Tenn., and then shipped to a plant in the United Kingdom where it is used in production of Rely+On Virkon, said Mr. Mackin.</p>
<p>Food giant Kraft Heinz, with some headquarters staff Downtown, has banned employee travel to and from China.</p>
<p>Spokesman Michael Mullen declined to specify how many Kraft Heinz employees work in China but said all of them have been out of the office because of the Lunar New Year holiday and “are accounted for and safe.”</p>
<p>After the holiday ends this week, employees will work from home “and we will reassess [that policy] as we learn more,” he said.</p>
