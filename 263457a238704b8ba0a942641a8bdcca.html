<h1>'Birds of Prey' is a lot of fun and just the tiniest bit batty</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>No clowning around: This time, Warner Bros. and D.C. Comics got it right.</p>
<p>Say what you will about “Joker,” an oh-so-serious-yet-superficial contemplation of mental illness, societal injustice and horrific violence, Oscar best picture nominee, yada yada yada.</p>
<p>If you want more of the best of “comic” in a comic book movie, leave it to a woman.</p>
<p>“Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)” has found such a woman. Cheerful, funny, still a bit heartbroken and literally bouncing with energy (and a bit of cocaine), she’s on the rebound after getting dumped by her boyfriend, her Puddin’, her Mistah J.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again picking up the baseball bat as Harley is Margot Robbie, reprising her 2016 “Suicide Squad” role. She’s been down but not out and after a mild makeover is back living her sort-of best life. She even has a new pet, a hyena named Bruce.</p>
<p>Freedom has its price, however. Before, she was under the protection of her favorite maniac. Now, “it took losing something I truly loved to see the target on my back was bigger than I thought.”</p>
<p>Oh yes, Harley Quinn has enemies. The film, directed by Cathy Yan from a screenplay by Christina Hodson, employs the clever use of brightly colored graphics to bring viewers up to speed on how Harley did wrong to this guy or that woman. Harley’s comments embroider the storytelling.</p>
<p>She’s done some pretty awful things to people, including feeding a man to Bruce. But unfolding in the style of “Deadpool,” with Harley expressing herself in voiceover, “Birds of Prey” is played more for laughs than head-bashing thrills.</p>
<p>There is of course, extreme violence (the film is rated R for that, plus language and some drug use), but it’s often highly stylized and wonderfully choreographed in “John Wick” fashion.</p>
<p>It’s also downright poetic at times. Water sprays and puddles on a prison floor during a jailbreak. Harley and her soon-to-be new squad work their way through an abandoned fun house as if they were contestants on “American Ninja Warrior.”</p>
<p>Such sequences are never boring or overlong, and that is high praise indeed. The humor and the visuals have to carry the load in “Birds of Prey,” because the plot is, to put it kindly, thin. Docking-the-film-half-a-ratings-star thin.</p>
<p>Harley is out on the street. One of the many pursuing her is Renee Montoya, a smart but unappreciated police detective. Montoya (Rosie Perez) gets into hot water with her boss, but that’s OK. As Harley explains, “No cop ever gets anything done until they’re suspended.”</p>
<p>She’s also wanted by crime kingpin Roman Sionis, aka Black Mask. Roman (played with a delightfully unbalanced creepiness by Ewan McGregor) is a narcissist extraordinaire who covets not only power but also things, just because. He also has a shirt with a print of his own face on it.</p>
<p>Also in the mix are Cassandra (Ella Jay Basco), a street kid who has stolen a diamond everyone in Gotham wants; Huntress, a mysterious woman in black with no apparent sense of humor, but she has a crossbow to make up for that (Mary Elizabeth Winstead); and Black Canary, a songstress with a special talent (Jurnee Smollett-Bell).</p>

<p>This isn’t a movie for the kiddies, but when they’re old enough, the bonds of friendship forged out of the need to protect Cassandra will be recognized as kind of a girl power thing. In mid-fight, Harley lends her friend a hair tie&nbsp;— talk about intuiting someone else’s needs.</p>
<p>“Birds of Prey” also has a neat soundtrack, including some great oldies (“It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World,” “Sway”) and newer songs (Halsey’s “Experiment on Me”).</p>
<p>Robbie has proven herself as a “serious” actor on so many occasions; this year alone, she was heartbreaking in “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood” and is up for a best supporting Oscar in “Bombshell.” It’s nice to see her cutting loose here, and, happily, that accent that wavered from merely high-pitched to Brooklynese in “Suicide Squad” has settled into a Harley of her own making.</p>
<p>Who needs the Joker, anyway?</p>
