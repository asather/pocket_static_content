<h1>Pet Tales: Rented chickens are pets and producers — of eggs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A blonde chicken named Betty and her friend Veronica dash from leafy green woods to join people on a wide expanse of lawn in Sewickley Heights. The hens seem happy to see Sylvia Dallas and they cluck quietly as she hand-feeds them mealworms. Then they check out two visitors, strutting up to a reporter and photographer like a couple of friendly dogs.</p>
<p>Though Betty and Veronica are past their prime egg-laying years, they have been welcomed back for their fourth season with Ms. Dallas and her husband, John Oliver. The couple doesn’t own them. They rent the chickens from Phil and Jenn Tompkins.</p>
<p>The hens spend April through October with Mr. Oliver and Ms. Dallas, then winter in Freeport, Armstrong County, with the Tompkinses, who have been operating their <a href="http://www.rentthechicken.com/p/western-pa-and-surrounding-areas.html" target="_blank">Rent The Chicken</a> business since September 2013.&nbsp;They’ve rented about 6,000 chickens in seven years, and Rent The Chicken franchises can be found in 30 states and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>Business has never been brisker.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a big spike this year” because of coronavirus stay-home orders, Mr. Tompkins said.&nbsp;“People are at home and the kids are getting bored. People can’t always find eggs in grocery stores.&nbsp; About 90 percent of our chickens are rented for the season, but we have an order in for more chickens that we hope will arrive in May.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Dallas is pleased to see Betty and Veronica again. “Of course we wanted them back. We’ve known them for four years. We just love our chickens. We don’t care about the eggs so much.”</p>
<p>Chickens can be charming, affectionate and fun to watch and many are valued more as pets than as egg producers. It’s an added bonus that chickens eat a lot of ticks, which cause Lyme disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To boost egg production, Mr. Tompkins sent a younger chick to join Betty and Veronica. The Oliver-Dallas grandchildren have named her Maxine.</p>
<p>“We’re getting about 12 eggs per week, which is plenty,” Ms. Dallas said.&nbsp;“Maxine lays an egg each day.”</p>
<p>Two young hens generally produce 8-14 eggs per week, according to <a href="http://www.rentthechicken.com/" target="_blank">Rentthechicken.com</a>.</p>
<p>Betty and Veronica are named for characters in the Archie Comics. Betty is a buff Orpington, Veronica is a black Australorp and Maxine is a barred rock.</p>
<p>Yes, all the chickens like to be held and petted, as Ms. Dallas demonstrated.</p>
<p>The two family dogs joined the photo shoot, proving that some dogs can coexist happily with chickens, but&nbsp;Mrs. Tompkins recommends supervising interactions between two-legged and four-legged pets.</p>
<p>Samantha, 9, a Labrador retriever, and Boney Maroney, 9, and English setter, greeted the chickens and visitors and then ate some of the mealworms.</p>
<p>The chicken free range through the woods and across the lawn all day, but go back into their rented coop at night. It protects them from owls, foxes and other predators that hunt at night.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen hawks swoop down during the day, but we think the chickens are too big to be carried off,” Ms. Dallas said.</p>
<p>The little barn-shaped coop is on wheels, and chicken manure falls through the bottom onto the grass. The coop is moved every day to spread the manure over a wide area.</p>
<p>“The chickens fertilized my yard all winter,” Mr. Tompkins said.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the Tomkinses have donated 10-12 dozen eggs to the Freeport Community Lunch program to help feed people during the pandemic. About 7,000 meals have been served.</p>
<p>The couple recently started delivering chickens and coops.</p>
<p>“We’re doing no-contact deliveries,” Mr. Tomkins said.&nbsp;“We are an agricultural business so we are permitted to operate.”</p>
<p>Rates are generally $550 for two hens or $650 for four hens. The fee includes a coop hand-built by an Amish farmer and enough chicken feed and mealworms treats to get you through the egg-laying season.</p>
<p>Renters can opt out at the end of October, rent the chickens the following April or buy the chickens and keep them year-round.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Dallas said mealworms and other things chickens eat can be purchased at feed stores; she goes to a nearby Agway. Her hens get extra treats including blueberries, oatmeal and table scraps.</p>
