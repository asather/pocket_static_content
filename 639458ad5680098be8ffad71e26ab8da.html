<h1>Comic book fans can get their fix locally, using mail orders and curbside pickups</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>You can’t browse the aisles, but you can still get your weekly comic book fix and support your favorite local stores.</p>
<p>Some stores have begun curbside pickups of pre-orders, and mail orders are another route to the latest from DC, Marvel and more during this time of closings and social distancing. Here are details on a few of the local shops and how to stay current on your comics:</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The upstairs Oakland haven known as Phantom of the Attic is closed, but you can place mail orders via comics@pota-oakland.com or call 412-621-1210. For information about in-stock orders through Friday, check <a href="https://www.facebook.com/potaOakland/photos/a.328267439926/10157745302904927/" target="_blank">Phantom’s Facebook page</a>.&nbsp;Phantom Games also has switched to mail order; call 412-682-6290, email what@potagames.com, or send a direct message via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Phantom-Games-320732952502/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>• Eide’s Entertainment at 112 Penn Ave., Uptown, is taking mail orders and doing curbside pickup.

<p>• New Dimensions Comics has six sites, at the Waterfront, Homestead,&nbsp;Pittsburgh Mills Mall, Tarentum; Cranberry; Butler; Ellwood City; and Ohio Valley Mall, St. Clairsville, Ohio.&nbsp;The stores previously had a mail-order subscribers list but now will take orders from all customers. Details of how it works are at <a href="http://ndcomics.com/mail-order-is-now-live/." target="_blank">http://ndcomics.com/mail-order-is-now-live/.</a> Curbside pickups have ceased, but in-store events set for late April are so far intact.</p>
