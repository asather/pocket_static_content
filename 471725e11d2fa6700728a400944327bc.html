<p>The Pirates season is coming to an end, and they have one of the worst records in Major League Baseball. So with just a couple games left, the time is now or never to ponder whether club could pick up a win against a baseball team composed entirely of current Steelers.&nbsp;The answer, you would hope, is a resounding “of course” but hey, just for fun, what’s the best lineup the Steelers could roll out on the diamond?</p>
<p>This isn’t just a thought exercise where we’ll speculate that Chase Claypool would steal a ton of bases or Cam Heyward could sock a lot of dingers. It’s meticulously researched to determine the ideal batting order and defensive alignment of Steelers-as-baseball players:</p>
<p><strong>1 - Cameron Sutton (CF)</strong>. What we know: The versatile defensive back was the starting center fielder for his high school baseball team, hitting .403 with 21 RBIs and 59 stolen bases. Wow! Sutton was a three-sport star who also excelled in basketball but was considering playing football and baseball in college before choosing Tennessee for the former only. Good decision.</p>
<p><strong>2 - Josh Dobbs (P)</strong>. What we know: Dobbs is another Volunteers football product who also had scholarship offers to play baseball in college. He even considered doing both at Duke and briefly practiced with the Tennessee baseball team. Archival research indicates he was a better infielder than hurler, but this team needs pitching, and it makes sense to have a quarterback do it. We’re also going to let him hit and use the DH elsewhere, so stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>3 - Ben Roethlisberger (SS)</strong>. What we know: How could anyone else hit third and play short than the franchise QB? This is risky given that at 38, not only is he the furthest removed from his baseball career but it’s anyone’s guess if he’ll have the range needed to play the most important spot on the field. He also played the outfield at his charity softball game two years ago (more on that later). Still, Roethlisberger was a .300 hitter and all-district shortstop at Findlay High, according to his official website, so we’ll give him the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p><strong>4 - Matt Feiler (1B)</strong>. What we know: Sure, Feiler played ball at Lampeter-Strasburg High School in the PIAA, but the real reason we’re including him — and batting him cleanup — is because the 6-foot-6, 330-pound left guard won the home run derby last time the Steelers had one during training camp at Saint Vincent. Mike Tomlin said he looked like “one of those AAU travel teamers who played first base and was a catcher, but he can put it over the fence.” Come on, Mike, he’s way too tall to be behind the dish. First base it is.</p>
<p><strong>5 - Alex Highsmith (2B)</strong>. What we know: Highsmith is another three-sport high school athlete. He hit .292 as a senior and was 9 for 10 on stolen bases. His position was a bit difficult to dig up, but it appears he was an infielder, so we’ll stick him at second and assume he can field the position.</p>
<p><strong>6 - Derek Watt (C)</strong>. What we know: What we don’t know is whether Watt has ever played catcher, but someone has to do it for this team, and who better than the fullback/special teams dirty work guy? He’s kind of got that sawed-off catcher’s body a little bit, too, and the cerebral nature needed to call a game. Plus, he definitely played high school baseball, so there’s a knowledge base there. And yet, this next guy claims he was better at the sport …</p>
<p><strong>7 - T.J. Watt (3B)</strong>. What we know: Not a lot, but he did say this on <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="_blank">our North Shore Drive podcast</a> over the offseason when asked if he or Derek was better at baseball: “Me. I was. But Derek played all throughout high school, I believe. I stopped after eighth grade. But as a youth baseball player, I was playing on Derek’s fifth-grade team in third grade, so that explains it.” Well, OK then, T.J. thinks highly enough of his baseball prowess that we’ll put him at the hot corner and give him a chance to drive in his brother (or yell at him if he doesn’t get on base). In his defense, he went yard a few times at that charity softball game in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>8 - Vance McDonald (DH)</strong>. What we know: According to a Joe Starkey column on the “Vanimal” a couple years ago, McDonald could “hit the skin off a baseball.” Now, that’s coming from his dad, Bret, so we’re taking it with a grain of salt and batting him eighth. But McDonald just looks like a baseball player, doesn’t he? So, he gets to hit, but we’re not taking any chances with him in the field.</p>
<p><strong>9 - Sean Davis (LF)</strong>. What we know: We’re glad the Steelers brought him back after training camp, because Davis was a high school baseball standout. He didn’t even play football until his junior year, but he played baseball starting at 4 years old, was a stud center fielder and went to Maryland because they were receptive to him playing both sports. He’ll be this squad’s Starling Marte, though, patrolling a cavernous left field at PNC Park and hopefully serving as a second leadoff hitter, turning the lineup over to Sutton. Here’s a full scouting report.</p>
<p><strong>Benny Snell (RF).</strong> What we know: Snell was big into travel baseball until focusing on football in high school. We know he has the burst to play right field (though hopefully he won’t commit any errors after fumbling twice in the first two weeks). A commercial shot in the offseason also lets us know he’s picked up a bat recently, but uh, the producers didn’t make him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlNgk-oj8OM&amp;ab_channel=UKFCU" target="_blank">look very adept at handling it</a>. Snell actually picked his high school in Columbus because it was better in that sport, so Benny Snell Baseball gets a role on this team, even if it’s just in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Jerald Hawkins (closer)</strong>. What we know: Acquired after Zach Banner’s season-ending injury, “Big Bubba Hawk” was actually an all-region pitcher at West St. Mary High School in Louisiana. At 6-6, 305, dude probably throws heat. Endurance might not be there, but every team needs a closer.</p>
