<p>Spring will arrive officially Thursday, but a sure sign of its arrival will be delayed this year due to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Rita’s Water Ice has postponed its annual free Italian Ice giveaway to celebrate the first day of spring.</p>
<p>“In light of the increasing concerns around COVID-19 and the precautionary risks associated with large gatherings, we are postponing our annual free Italian Ice giveaway,” the Trevose-based company announced. “Our First Day of Spring Free Ice Giveaway brings together thousands of guests for one-of-a-kind treats and a free Italian Ice. It’s our favorite day of the year, and one that has become a treasured tradition. However, the health of our community and guests is our highest priority, so we are postponing this celebration as a precautionary move,” the company noted.</p>
<p>“Rita’s is committed to providing a clean and safe environment for our guests and team members. Guests are encouraged to check with their local Rita’s for daily operating hours as it may vary by community,” the announcement stated.</p>
<p>Rita’s Italian Ice opened its doors in Bensalem in 1984, and now has more than 600 locations worldwide, serving Italian ice made daily with fresh fruit, as well as frozen custard.</p>
