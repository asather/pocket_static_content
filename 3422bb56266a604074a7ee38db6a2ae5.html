<h1>Buying Here: Starter home in Edgewood priced at $180,000</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Alicia and Daniel Lloyd love their neighborhood so much that they bought another home just three minutes away from <strong>228 Elm St.</strong> in Edgewood.</p>
<p>“We were expecting our second child and thought we might want to make a move. We really love the area so much,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lloyd, an agent for Howard Hanna Real Estate Services, has listed the home for $179,999 (MLS No. 1422388). It is open by appointment (<a href="https://www.howardhanna.com/Property/Detail/228-Elm-St-Edgewood-PA-15218/Westpenn/1422388" target="_blank">www.howardhanna.com</a> or 724-889-5206).</p>
<p>Built in 1920, the brick house has four bedrooms, two full baths and more than 1,500 square feet of living space. It has lots of original woodwork and sits on a level lot with three off-street parking spaces.</p>
<p>The entry has its original paneling and staircase. The floors were covered with brown carpet but now feature new&nbsp;Brazilian hardwood on the first floor and walnut laminate on the second floor. The entry and kitchen were redone with gray tile.</p>
<p>The dining room has a decorative fireplace and new hardwood floors. The adjacent living room has lots of windows.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, wood cabinetry and stainless-steel appliances complement solid-surface counters. The small cooking island is topped with butcher block. One cabinet is used as a pantry and a door leads to the backyard filled with mature trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>Three bedrooms are on the second floor. The master bedroom has an adjacent bathroom with a large walk-in shower. All of the doors are original and the hardware has been restored.</p>
<p>“All of the knobs in the house have been refurbished,” Mr. Lloyd said. “A local handyman took all of the handles off and refurbished them. The patina is wonderful.”</p>
<p>The dark gray nursery has a trio of tall windows and floating shelves. Another bedroom features a large map of the world against creamy white walls.</p>
<p>The hall bathroom, which has original rose-colored porcelain tile and an alcove tub, services the other two second-floor bedrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two large rooms on the third floor. One is painted bright blue and is used as a playroom. The other is used as a home office and has original linoleum tile.</p>
<p>“Technically, the home has two bedrooms up there, but we didn’t want to stage them as bedrooms,” Mr. Lloyd said.</p>
<p>The laundry is in the unfinished basement.&nbsp;There is central air conditioning and forced-air heat.</p>
<p>The property’s Allegheny County assessed value is $92,500. Over the past three years, five houses have sold in the 200 block of Elm Street for prices ranging from $40,000 in July 2019 to $215,000 in June 2019 (<a href="http://www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/Search.aspx" target="_blank">www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/Search.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>The house is near the Regent Square business district, Edgewood Towne Center and the ramp to the Parkway East.</p>
<p>“We fell in love with the sidewalks, tree-lined streets and the nearby dog park,” Mr. Lloyd said. “It’s close enough to the city and far enough for a quiet stroll.”</p>
<p>The homeowner and agent said it is a great starter home for&nbsp;a first-time home buyer.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are getting pushed out of the market in the East End,” he said. “We are seeing the footprint push outward for more affordability.”</p>
