<h1>Wischnowski named executive editor of the Post-Gazette</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Stan J. Wischnowski, who served as the top news executive at Philadelphia Inquirer for 10 years and led the paper to a Pulitzer Prize in 2012, has been appointed the new executive editor and vice president of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, John Robinson Block, publisher and editor-in-chief, announced.</p>
<p>Mr. Wischnowski, 58, will begin with the Post-Gazette on Sept.14.</p>
<p>Keith Burris, who has been the newspaper’s executive editor since February 2019, is moving from that position to concentrate more on his roles as vice president and editorial director of Block Communications. As editorial director, Mr. Burris will oversee the editorial, opinion and commentary pages of the Post-Gazette and The Blade of Toledo, Ohio.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to appoint Stan Wischnowski executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,” Mr. Block said. “His long and distinguished career inspires us at this difficult time. I look forward to working with him.”</p>
<p>During his 20 years in Philadelphia, Mr. Wischnowski directed the merger of three newsrooms (Inquirer, Daily News and philly.com) into one, which involved overhauling the newsroom’s organizational structure and creating one of the country’s largest newspaper investigative teams. He also helped in modernizing the newsroom into a 24-hour news operation.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Wischnowski’s leadership, the Inquirer won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize Gold Medal —&nbsp;journalism’s top prize —&nbsp;for a series of investigative stories exposing the magnitude of violence in Philadelphia’s public schools. The paper, during his tenure, was awarded the Pulitzer in 2014 for criticism, and was a Pulitzer finalist in Local Reporting in 2019 and Commentary in 2017.</p>
<p>As Inquirer executive editor, Mr. Wischnowski helped found Spotlight PA, a 15-person investigative team based in Harrisburg and funded through the Lenfest Institute for Journalism.</p>
<p>Mr. Wischnowski also organized a legal coalition of Pennsylvania’s top news organizations that led to successful public records release in high-profile cases involving Penn State’s Jerry Sandusky, Bill Cosby, the Catholic Church and the state’s execution procedures. During his tenure, the Inquirer also formed a wide range of content partnerships with the likes of the Post-Gazette, ProPublica, National Geographic Society and PolitiFact among others.</p>
<p>Mr. Wischnowski said it is a privilege to direct the Post-Gazette’s news coverage.</p>
<p>“The Post-Gazette has a strong tradition of serving this region with outstanding local reporting, so it’s a tremendous honor to have the opportunity to help uphold and improve upon that legacy,” Mr. Wischnowski. “At such a critical time for this community, particularly given the pandemic’s devastating impact, the PG’s public-service mission has never been more important.”</p>
<p>A native of suburban Chicago, Mr. Wischnowski previously worked at the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester, N.Y., the Detroit News, the Lansing State Journal in Michigan and the North Hills News Record/Valley News Dispatch in suburban Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Mr. Wischnowski and his wife, Shawn, have three sons: two of whom are practicing attorneys and graduates from the University of Pittsburgh. His other son is a certified public accountant in suburban Philadelphia.</p>
<p>There will be no changes on the business side of the Post-Gazette. Tracey DeAngelo remains president and general manager.</p>
