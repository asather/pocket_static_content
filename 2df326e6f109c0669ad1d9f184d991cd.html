<h1>Trump will hold campaign rally at Pittsburgh International Airport on Sept. 22</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the second time this month, President Donald Trump will hold a campaign rally at an airport in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, known to rally his supporters at airport hangars where he can exit Air Force One and take the stage, will campaign at Pittsburgh International Airport in Moon on Sept. 22.</p>
<p>The rally, billed by his reelection campaign as a&nbsp;“Great American Comeback Event,” comes a few weeks after Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/09/03/Trump-visit-Latrobe-PA-rally-reelection-campaign-law-and-order-radical-Democrats/stories/202009030197" target="_blank">visited Latrobe</a> for a similar event.</p>
<p>The day of his Moon rally will mark 42 days out from the Nov. 3 election, in which Pennsylvania could play a critical role in the race between Mr. Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden hasn’t held a traditional campaign rally in Western Pennsylvania since he launched his bid for the presidency last April, but he’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2020/06/30/biden-wont-hold-campaign-rallies-because-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/#e2f7adb508bf" target="_blank">said publicly</a> that he wouldn’t hold rallies because of the risk of spreading COVID-19.</p>
