<h1>Steelers' Cam Heyward supports Jewish community following DeSean Jackson controversy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Not many NFL players have made statements regarding Eagles receiver DeSean Jackson stirring up controversy by sharing a fake Hitler quote on Instagram on Tuesday. Two Steelers, though, publicly denounced anti-Semitism in the wake of Jackson’s Instagram posts.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward sent out two tweets on the matter, one unequivocally stating that he believes “Desean was wrong” and another discussing the “ignorance and injustice” Pittsburgh experienced in October 2018, when 11 people were killed during a mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Squirrel Hill.</p>
<p>Heyward’s statement came a day after Steelers offensive lineman Zach Banner <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/07/08/desean-jackson-zach-banner-steelers-nfl-anti-semitism-jewish-community/stories/202007080117" target="_blank">released an emotional video</a> on social media explicitly denouncing anti-Semitism and advocating for unity between the Black and the Jewish communities.</p>
<p>“We need to understand that Jewish people deal with the same amount of hate and similar hardships and hard times [as Black people],” Banner said. “I’m not trying to get emotional right now, but I want to preach to the Black and brown community that we need to uplift and put our arms around them just as much.”</p>
<p>Heyward is a Pittsburgh native who used to live in Squirrel Hill and was deeply affected by the Tree of Life shooting.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter where you come from,” Heyward <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/sean-gentille/2018/10/28/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-tree-of-life-cam-heyward-steelers/stories/201810280225" target="_blank">said at the time</a>. “My mom went to bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs right there. My dad [former Pitt running back Craig “Iron Head” Heyward] played at the Jewish Community Center right there. He played basketball.</p>
<p>“This affects everybody. And it’s just not fair.”</p>
<p>In 2019, Heyward <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/12/08/Steelers-NFL-cleats-Cody-Sabol-Cam-Heyward-Vance-McDonald-Benny-Snell-Mark-Barron/stories/201912080172" target="_blank">wore specialized cleats</a> with the “Stronger Than Hate” phrase and symbol emblazoned on them as part of the NFL’s “My Cause, My Cleats” week. The design was dedicated to the 11 Tree of Life victims and he was representing the <a href="https://jccpgh.org/jewish-life-arts-events/10-27-healing-partnership/" target="_blank">10.27 Healing Partnership</a>, a Squirrel Hill-based organization that provides support for those affected either directly or tangentially by the mass shooting.</p>
<p>Jackson has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/07/07/DeSean-Jackson-anti-Semitic-Eagles-quote-attributed-to-Hitler-Instagram-posts/stories/202007070134" target="_blank">since apologized</a> for sharing the anti-Semitic quote and the Eagles <a href="https://twitter.com/Eagles/status/1280528345067896834" target="_blank">put out a statement</a> saying the organization spoke to him and conveyed its belief that the messages in his posts were “offensive, harmful and absolutely appalling.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1281300009321992195" target="_blank">announced the completion</a> of his production company’s first documentary film project, “<a href="https://deadline.com/2020/07/cinetic-media-and-play-action-pictures-set-the-meaning-of-hitler-as-inaugural-docu-for-jeffrey-luries-new-production-company-1202981754/" target="_blank">The Meaning of Hitler</a>,” which will “put a provocative spotlight on our culture’s fascination with Hitler and Nazism as it sets itself against the backdrop of the current rise of white supremacy, the normalization of anti-Semitism and the weaponization of history itself,” according to Deadline.</p>
<p>A few professional athletes, including fellow Eagles receiver <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCYT3RYFjr1/" target="_blank">Marquise Goodwin</a> and retired former NBA star <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2020/07/08/stephen-jackson-desean-jackson-anti-semitic-comments" target="_blank">Stephen Jackson</a>, initially came out in support of the messaging in the posts Jackson shared but <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCZDYhOldXK/" target="_blank">both</a> <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29432161/stephen-jackson-comments-had-do-anti-semitism" target="_blank">later</a> apologized.</p>
<p>Two Jewish NFL players — Chiefs offensive lineman <a href="https://twitter.com/MitchSchwartz71/status/1281033564432355329/photo/1" target="_blank">Mitchell Schwartz</a> and Patriots receiver Julian Edelman — released statements on the matter, with Edelman even offering to take Jackson to the&nbsp;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., if Jackson would take him to the nearby National Museum of African American History and Culture as an educational experience for both of them.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen DeSean make outstanding plays in his football career and we’ve communicated over social media,” Edelman said in the video. “I’ve got nothing but respect for his game. I know he said some ugly things but I do see an opportunity to have a conversation.</p>
<p>“I’m proud of my Jewish heritage and to me, it’ s not just about religion. It’s about community and culture, as well.”</p>
