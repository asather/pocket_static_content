<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penguins goalie Matt Murray was already preparing for the 2020 NHL playoffs to begin some time in the near future. Now, he’ll have to get ready for fatherhood as well.</p>
<p>Murray and his wife, Christina, announced Wednesday via Instagram that they are expecting a “baby GIRL Murray” in January 2021, according to Christina’s post. The Murrays revealed Christina’s pregnancy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CBqVjHSjqJf/" target="_blank">four days after</a> their first wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>Murray <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CB1ecsLDb4i/" target="_blank">posted the same photo</a> to Instagram with five pink heart emojis as the caption.</p>
<p>The Penguins’ Twitter account quickly offered its congratulations to the Murray family for their big news.</p>
<p>Penguins fans might be most familiar with Christina from a 2017 video that went semi-viral after Murray won his second Stanley Cup in a row. He gave Christina a celebratory kiss, but based on her reaction he must have tasted like he had just played an NHL hockey game.</p>
<p>She later <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BVOlUy4Az8j/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank">clarified on Instagram</a> that Murray tasted just fine, “but his beard was so sweaty it was like I was kissing Beckham.”</p>
<p>The Murrays have two Newfoundland dogs, Beckham and Leo, who of course have <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beckhamandleothenewfs/?hl=en" target="_blank">their own</a> Instagram account. The dogs actually <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/penguins-matt-murray-groomsman-dog/c-308120648" target="_blank">served as groomsmen</a> when Matt and Christina eloped last June.</p>
