<h1>Plant early-flowering bulbs and hungry bees will thank you</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On an unseasonably warm day in February, worker bees leave their hive to forage. After a long winter, honey and pollen supplies are low and food stores must be replenished. The queen soon will begin laying eggs for a new generation of worker bees.</p>
<p>The late winter landscape is bleak, but the blooms of some early-flowering bulbs are opening just in time to provide what the colony needs.</p>
<p>Fall planted bulbs are reliable sources of the earliest spring flowers. Varieties can be chosen to bloom from late February, through March and April and on into May. Their blooms provide the sugar/carbohydrate nectar and the protein/fat-rich pollen that bees need for survival until wildflowers and spring perennials bloom. Nectar will be converted to honey in the hive and, when combined with pollen, eventually will feed bee larvae.</p>
<p>Spring bulbs planted in larger masses or drifts have great visual impact and provide “one-stop” food shopping for bees. Some bulbs naturalize, meaning they establish and expand over time, and can be planted in lawns and woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Do your research before buying. Many bulbs are deer-, rabbit- and rodent-resistant. Some bulbs are North American natives, others are not. Some prefer a sunny location while others do better in a part-shade woodland garden. Be sure the bulbs are viable in our USDA 6 growing zone.</p>
<p>If possible, choose cultivars that have single flowers; bees often can’t reach nectar at the bottom of double-flowering forms. Avoid over-hybridized varieties as nectar and pollen often have been bred out of these bulbs. Plant species and heirloom bulbs whose flowers bees love to visit. Choose a range of early, mid- and late spring-blooming bulbs. Be aware that bees are most attracted to blue, purple, white and yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Most importantly, ensure that your bulbs have not been cultivated using systemic neonicotinoid insecticides. Studies have shown a link between neonicotinoids and declining bee populations. Reputable bulb growers should include this information in their literature.</p>
<p>Plant spring-flowering bulbs between the end of September and the end of November when the soil temperature is below 60 degrees. Plant in loose, well-drained soil that has a pH of 6-7. Add bone meal or bulb fertilizer before planting. For a natural look, drop handfuls of bulbs from waist height and plant where they land. Most bulbs should be planted 2-3 times deeper than their height. Make certain the flat end is down and the pointed end faces up.</p>
<p>Bulb can be a catchall term for corms, tubers, rhizomes or true bulbs. Each requires different planting depths. Some require an overnight soaking to re-hydrate before planting. Always follow planting instructions.</p>
<p>Plant bulbs this autumn not only for your delight next spring but to feed bees. The bees, in return, will pollinate your flowers, vegetables, shrubs and fruit and ornamental trees. Everyone wins!</p>
