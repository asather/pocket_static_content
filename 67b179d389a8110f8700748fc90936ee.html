<h1>Penguins' Jim Rutherford, David Morehouse taking pay cuts during COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford, along with CEO and president David Morehouse, have decided to take one for the team.</p>
<p>The Post-Gazette has learned that Rutherford and Morehouse will be taking voluntary pay cuts so that other members of the Penguins staff will not be as impacted financially from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>When the NHL decided to suspend the season March 12 to help decrease the spread of the virus, much of the revenue that comes from games was also halted. During similar situations in the past, such as the 2004-05 lockout, some teams were forced to slash salaries for employees or cut jobs entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This unfortunately appears inevitable in many other sectors of the economy. U.S. Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin recently estimated the unemployment rate in the United States could hit 20% if a proposed economic stimulus package is not passed.</p>
<p>By sacrificing some of their salaries, Rutherford and Morehouse have ensured that members of the hockey staff, office employees or other individuals within the organization wonâ€™t feel the financial burden of the crisis as much.</p>
<p>This is the latest way the Penguins are looking out for their employees and community during a difficult time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, the Penguins announced a plan to make sure that full- and part-time arena and service employees at PPG Paints Arena would not lose income during the work stoppage. Funding for that initiative will come from players, led by Sidney Crosby, the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation and the Mario Lemieux Foundation. Those donations will go toward ushers, ticket takers, concession workers, cleaning staff and other arena workers.</p>
<p>Additionally, several Penguins players are working to raise money for <a href="https://pledgeit.org/for/athletesforrelief" target="_blank">COVID-19 relief on pledgeit.org</a>. Jake Guentzel, Bryan Rust, Matt Murray, Dominik Simon and Teddy Blueger are among the Penguins who have donated memorabilia. Anyone who donates at least $25 in the fight against COVID-19 will be entered to win.</p>
