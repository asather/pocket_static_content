<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins announced Monday that Patric Hornqvist and eight other players who were being <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/07/13/penguins-covid-19-players-sideline-training-camp-nhl/stories/202007130070" target="_blank">held out due to potential exposure to COVID-19</a> had been cleared to return to practice. They did not participate in Monday’s scrimmage. They instead skated on the second rink at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex.</p>
<p>Last Monday, when the Penguins began their postseason training camp, the team announced the players would be “voluntarily” held out for an indefinite period after a possible secondary exposure to COVID-19, “in an effort to avoid exposure to anyone else within the organization.” They sat out seven days.</p>
<p>In addition to the veteran forward Hornqvist, the players sidelined were forwards Anthony Angello, Adam Johnson, Samuel Poulin, Sam Miletic and Philip Varone; defensemen Juuso Riikola and Pierre-Olivier Joseph; and goalie Alex D’Orio.</p>
<p>With those nine still sidelined Sunday and Sidney Crosby <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/07/19/Sidney-Crosby-injury-Pittsburgh-Penguins-Mike-Sullivan-Evan-Rodrigues/stories/202007190152" target="_blank">missing practice with an undisclosed issue</a>, the Penguins had just 12 forwards and 24 total players.</p>
<p>Crosby, who did not finish Saturday’s scrimmage, sat out again Monday.</p>
<p>The Penguins also announced Monday that they had added another scrimmage to their camp schedule. They’ll scrimmage Thursday and Saturday, too. They are scheduled to travel to Toronto on Sunday for the start of the playoffs. They start their qualifying round series against the Montreal Canadiens on Aug. 1.</p>
