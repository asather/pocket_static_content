<p>The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra announced Wednesday the cancellation of the remainder of the 2019-20 season as well as the cancellation of its 2020 European tour, which had been scheduled for late August and September.</p>
<p>“It is painful to need to take this action, but we know it is in the best interest of the health and safety of the community, and that must always be our top priority,” said orchestra president and CEO Melia Tourangeau.</p>
<p>She also said the orchestra is exploring ways to bring music to the community during the&nbsp;“yellow phase” of the state’s reopening plan, including outdoor performances or small ensemble performances.</p>
<p>Concerts are canceled through July. The symphony is offering refunds to ticket holders, although the organization suggests applying the tickets toward concerts next season or donating the cost of the ticket to the orchestra in exchange for a tax deduction.</p>
<p>In April, the PSO reduced salaries for musicians and some staff.&nbsp;</p>
