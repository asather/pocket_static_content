<h1>Finding workout spots a challenge for Jacob Stallings, other Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s hardly a secret that finding workout spots has been difficult, if not impossible, for professional athletes during the COVID-19 outbreak. For Jacob Stallings, it’s been an exceptionally large challenge, with the Pirates catcher now on his fourth baseball field trying to get a little work done.</p>
<p>After spring training was canceled and players went home, Stallings started working out at Vanderbilt University, which soon closed. He then moved to nearby Lipscomb University, where he’s befriended the baseball coach, Jeff Forehand, but that, too, shuttered. Even Stallings’ high school — Brentwood Academy — turned away the mild-mannered backstop.</p>
<p>Finally, on Friday morning, Stallings and his workout partners found another high school field that did the job, preferring to conceal its identity for fear they’ll get kicked out again.</p>
<p>“Lemme keep that to myself,” Stallings said. “We had a good day [Friday], so we’re trying to stay there.”</p>
<p>“We” in this case refers to Stallings, Phil Gosselin of the Phillies and the Braves’ Adam Duvall. It also includes Stallings’ father, Kevin, the former Pitt men’s basketball coach. Apparently Kevin Stallings throws batting practice to the group.</p>
<p>“My dad throws really good BP,” Jacob said. “He’s pretty much who I hit off of every offseason, anyway.”</p>
<p>Among Stallings’ Pirates teammates, it seems like he’s one of the luckier ones, too, despite the ongoing search for a place to hit.</p>
<p>“Just talking with guys, some guys aren’t even hitting right now because it’s just not an option,” Stallings said. “They don’t have a place or the means to do it. Then a lot of guys are doing makeshift workouts because all the gyms are closed.</p>
<p>“I know [Bryan] Reynolds is doing some Peloton workouts. He said they’re really good, and he’s doing a lot of body-weight stuff because he doesn’t have access to a gym. I know a number of guys are kind of in that same situation.”</p>
<p>As far as throwing, Stallings isn’t doing much — only about three times a week, from 90 feet or so. The reason for the lighter load is simple: Many players are cognizant of the fact that regular season baseball could stretch into November, and nobody wants to wear themselves out now.</p>
<p>“We’re all in this wait-and-see mode,” Stallings said. “You don’t want to stay ramped up for right now, at least full speed, because if we do decide to extend the season, that’s going to be a long time to be training your body nonstop. We’re just trying to be smart right now: staying in shape but not overdoing it until we get some more information.”</p>
<p>While Stallings has conserved some energy with baseball, he’s used it up on hockey. Before spring training, Jacob, Kevin and Jacob’s son, Emmitt, attended a Nashville Predators game with one of Kevin’s golfing buddies. They sat in the front row, on the glass, and Emmitt has been hooked over since.</p>
<p>Jacob and his wife, Amy Beth, bought Emmitt a couple sticks and nets for his birthday. Emmitt has his own hockey/catching mask that Jacob said looks like it came from “an old-time warrior movie.”</p>
<p>“That’s just about all he wants to do,” Jacob said with a laugh. “I’m getting a little worn out with hockey right now.”</p>
<p>Baseball will hopefully be back soon, and when it does, Stallings and others will probably owe an apology to Reynolds, whom Stallings said was “Number 1” when it came to pointing out the severity of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Very early on, too,” Stallings said. “He was all over it.”</p>
<p>Wait, so Bryan Reynolds, who would probably describe a war or significant world event in 10 words or less, was the most proactive when it came to COVID-19?</p>
<p>“I don’t know if germaphobe is the right word, but he was like, ‘Hey, this is serious. Wash your hands. Don’t touch me.’ ” Stallings said. “Turns out he was right.”</p>
<p>Another topic Stallings touched on was the Astros’ cheating scandal. Back in January, at PiratesFest, Stallings was one of the more open and insightful players on the topic, explaining how the opposing broadcasters would poke fun at the Pirates using multiple signs with nobody on base. Now everybody knows why, Stallings argued.</p>
<p>Stallings didn’t see all of Evan Gattis’ strikingly honest comments for what the Astros did — “We obviously cheated baseball and cheated fans,” was one example — but caught the gist of what the former Houston player said.</p>
<p>“I’m sure a number of their guys regret it,” Stallings said. “It doesn’t make me feel any better about what happened.”</p>
<p>Although spring training was interrupted because of the coronavirus, Stallings said he and the Pirates pitchers — at the urging of the coaching staff — had been cognizant of switching up their sequences for calling pitches, trying to be mindful of something that had become a discussion point around the league.</p>
<p>“The coaching staff was pretty adamant about working on different sequences, especially with our relievers because relievers tend to be more simplistic with what signs they use,” Stallings said. “We hadn’t had all of those discussions, but we certainly began them and began that process of, ‘Hey, we need to work on this because we’re going to do it.’ ”</p>
