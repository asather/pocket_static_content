<h1>Penguins mailbag: Should NHL prioritize 2020 playoffs or next regular season?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome back to Mike’s Mailbag.</em></p>
<p><em>Before we get started, I hope everyone is staying safe — and staying at home. I know this is an uncertain time right now. A lot of us have far bigger and more serious concerns than hockey. But hopefully we can use this space for a brief distraction.</em></p>
<p><em>All right, with that disclaimer out of the way, let’s do it.</em></p>
<p><strong>John A.:</strong> What’s going on with Jake Guentzel? Do you think there’s a chance he can come back if the season resumes?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>When Guentzel underwent surgery on New Year’s Eve, the Penguins initially projected he would miss 4-to-6 months. On the most optimistic end of the spectrum, May would be the earliest he could come back, which is about when the NHL’s conference finals would begin.&nbsp;However, my sense is that it’s going to take closer to the six-month window than the four. Maybe longer.</p>
<p>In theory, if the NHL resumes, the extra two months (or more) could make a major difference.&nbsp;But even with the delay, if I had to guess, I’d say Guentzel has played his last game this year. That’s not only because his rehab is going to be long and intense, but also because there’s a good chance the decision gets taken out of Guentzel’s hands.</p>
<p>Which leads to our next question ...</p>
<p><strong>Paul G.:&nbsp;</strong>If you were the commissioner of the NHL, how would you go about resuming the season?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>When the season was suspended last week, commissioner Gary Bettman originally said he hoped to award a Stanley Cup. He’s since pivoted slightly, saying the priority now is to start the 2020-21 season on time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, these are uncertain times. The safety of fans and players should be the top priority. But if there’s any way to avoid it, the 2019-20 postseason shouldn’t be canceled — even if it means starting the 2020-21 season late.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, there is no professional sports league in which the regular season means less. At the same time, there’s no professional sports league where the playoffs are as fun and unpredictable. I say give us more of the candy and less of the vegetables. Find a way to award a Cup this year, even if it’s in September or October and then shorten what is already much too long of a regular season in 2020-21.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe this is all a moot argument and we’ll end up living the real-life version of the Brendan Fraser movie,&nbsp;“Blast from the Past.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:&nbsp;</strong>There have been some light-hearted videos going around the internet recently. Do you have a favorite?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>Since this is a Penguins mailbag, this one has to be near the top of the list.&nbsp;The flightless birds at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago went on a “field trip” to visit the other animals.</p>
<p>But, I’ve also got to stick with my brand. Seeing the Italians celebrating their culture and sharing community while quarantined warmed my heart ... and made me hungry for a big plate of pasta.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tom S.:&nbsp;</strong>If the season doesn’t resume, should Mike Sullivan still be a Jack Adams Award finalist?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>For sure. Since he arrived in Pittsburgh, Sullivan has proven he’s a talented coach who commands respect and gets the most out of his players. You don’t win back-to-back Cups without a leader behind the bench.&nbsp;However, because the Penguins have so much star power, it seemed like there were some who overlooked the coaching aspect when it came to awards season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year should have changed that. With so many injuries to so many key players, Sullivan led what was essentially the Wilkes-Barre/Pittsburgh Penguins to the top of the Metro. I’m not sure there’s a team in the league that weathered this much adversity this seamlessly. Even though the Penguins went through a skid before the work stoppage,&nbsp;Sullivan should be one of the three finalists.</p>
<p>In terms of others who have a shot at the award, Columbus Blue Jackets coach John Tortorella has a good argument. Everyone expected the Blue Jackets to be trash after they lost their leading scorer (Artemi Panarin) and starting goaltender (Sergei Bobrovsky) in the offseason. But right now, they’re in a wild card spot. But it’s tough to give him too much credit because, in a suspended season, who knows if they would have stayed there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I think it’s between Sullivan and Craig Berube of St. Louis. A finalist for the award last year, Berube took over the Blues when they were in 30th place in November of 2018 and ended up winning the Cup. This year, he’s continued to build on that momentum. The Blues currently sit atop the Western Conference. While this is a single-season award, I wonder if some voters might look at the total body of work and give Berube the nod.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:&nbsp;</strong>The QMJHL season was canceled. Do you think that’s the end of the junior careers for Sam Poulin and Nathan Legare?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>Both Penguins prospects lit up the QMJHL, ranking within the top 20. Legare was 18th with 71 points (35 goals, 36 assists), while Poulin was 14th with 77 points (32 goals, 45 assists). Both also impressed last year during training camp. If nothing else, I think these guys will come into training camp with a realistic chance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Josh:&nbsp;</strong>I’m lost without sports. What are you doing to pass your time in quarantine?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>Can you believe this is how some people who don’t like sports actually live their lives? Crazy, right? I’ve tried everything in search of a fix. I actually found myself stuck on senior barrel racing on the rodeo channel. Pure electricity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I’ve decided cooking shows are the best substitute for sports. There’s a clock. A winner. A loser. What more do you need? Chopped is the best one on the Food Network. I also recently discovered a new show called Tournament of Champions. It’s not the NCAA tournament. But there is a bracket and at this point, I’ll take what I can get.</p>
