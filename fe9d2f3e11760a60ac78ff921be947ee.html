<h1>Paul Zeise: AFC playoffs showed us how far away the Steelers are</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes is a wizard, a true superstar and one of the most dynamic players the NFL has seen in a long time. Tennessee’s Derrick Henry is a beast and runs behind an offensive line full of road graders. Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson had an MVP season and at times was unstoppable, and Houston’s Deshaun Watson has played at a high level too.</p>
<p>Mahomes, Jackson and Watson haven’t yet reached their 25th birthdays, and Henry is 26. This season has definitely been a changing of the guard in the AFC, and that’s why it looks as if the Steelers’ window of winning another Super Bowl with Ben Roethlisberger has probably closed.</p>
<p>Not only are the stars of most of the AFC playoff teams young and going to get better, but in many cases, the teams around them will too.</p>
<p>And don’t get me started about how refreshing it was to see superior play callers utilize their team’s strengths...</p>
<p>OK, get me started for one quick minute. When I watch teams like San Francisco and Tennessee run the ball at will and do so without great quarterbacks, it makes me wonder what Randy Fichtner and Co. are doing in the run game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the Titans had Derrick Henry, but the 49ers ran all over Green Bay with some dude nobody had ever heard of who went undrafted and has been cut six times.</p>
<p>But I digress...</p>
<p>Roethlisberger is still likely to be one of the better quarterbacks in the AFC next season, but it is unrealistic to think Father Time hasn’t slowed him down some.</p>
<p>Age and wear and tear eventually gets to everyone, especially at quarterback. The best indicator of this is that Eli Manning, Tom Brady and Philip Rivers are all on the market, and it isn’t like teams are falling on themselves to get one of them. Their skills have all clearly diminished. That doesn’t diminish what they accomplished. It just means they aren’t in their prime anymore and the same goes for Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>Sure he threw for more than 5,000 yards in 2018, but what did it get the Steelers? They missed the playoffs, and then came an offseason of turmoil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let’s not forget that Roethlisberger won’t have anyone as dynamic as Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell by his side next year. He will have, maybe, an older version of Vance McDonald, and he is no longer standing behind the best offensive line in football. And he’ll be 38 coming off a lost season and a major surgery to his throwing arm.</p>
<p>Now look at the rest of the AFC. The Chiefs, for instance, are a machine on offense, and Mahomes will only get better. You really think the Steelers will be able to trade touchdowns with them in a game that matters? I don’t. And Tennessee will re-sign Henry and try to upgrade at quarterback and if they do, watch how that offense takes off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Steelers defense is great, there are some places where age could become a factor. How many more seasons does Joe Haden have at a high level? Cam Heyward? And what if they lose Javon Hargrave or Stephon Tuitt isn’t the same player he was?</p>
<p>There are a lot of variables, I know, but I also know the more I watched these AFC playoffs, the more I realized just how far from the top of the conference the Steelers really are.</p>
