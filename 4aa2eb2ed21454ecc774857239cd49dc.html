<h1>PIAA diving preview: North Catholic looking for unheard of sweep</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kyle Maziarz has been on a mission this season to leave a legacy behind when he leaves North Catholic and continues his diving career at Georgetown.</p>
<p>And, if things work out the way he hopes, he could be considered the greatest WPIAL Class 2A boys diver.</p>
<p>Maziarz, who never even competed in diving until his sophomore year with the Trojans, won his second WPIAL title in three years and set the meet record with a 558.05 this year at South Park. He is also a two-time PIAA champion and is hoping to cap his career with a third state title March 14 at Bucknell University’s Kinney Natatorium.</p>
<p>“This year I’ve looked at my competition and a lot of it has been weeded out,” Maziarz said. “I’m trying to make sure that I know I’m not safe because no one is safe in anything, because there’s always going to be upsets.”</p>
<p>As far as the seeding, Maziarz has a 45.90 point edge over Giovanni Masters of Hickory and 93.40 over Ryan Hess of General McLane. Even so, he’s not about to take anything for granted despite the fact he has seen his competition in action earlier this season.</p>
<p>“Giovanni, he came to one of our first meets at North Allegheny because he’s the only one on his team and his dad’s the dive coach, so they kind of just go wherever,” Maziarz said. “He wanted to compete against me because he knew I was defending the title. It was one of our first meets so it was close, but I came out winning, so that gave me confidence.”</p>
<p>Knowing the competition is a huge advantage at a meet like this where divers don’t necessarily see each other throughout the year.</p>
<p>“I’m not going into this blind wondering who’s going to show up and crank out these amazing dives,” Maziarz said. “I respect him, he’s an amazing diver and does a ton of cliff diving on the side, but I feel like the amount of work I’ve put in this year has been more than any of the other years.”</p>
<p><strong>Class 2A girls</strong></p>
<p>Only twice previously has the WPIAL swept both the boys and girls titles at the PIAA Class 2A meet, including last year when Maziarz and Ringgold alumna Anna Vogt did the honors.</p>
<p>Prior to that the only other duo to accomplish the feat was in 2007 when Kayla Kelosky of Riverside and Justin Duncan of South Park pulled it off.</p>
<p>One thing that has never happened in either classification is two divers from the same school sweeping the state finals. But it could happen this year.</p>
<p>Maziarz is the top seed and the two-time reigning state champion, but this year he is joined by North Catholic freshman Maggie Foley, who is also the top seed on the girls side.</p>
<p>Foley picked up 440.45 points in the Class 2A finals at South Park and had a 6.00 edge over Harbor Creek sophomore Reagan Rand, who finished eighth last year.</p>
<p>Bella Taraski of District 10 Villa Maria, who came in 20th a year ago, is seeded third with 424.00 points.</p>
<p><strong>Class 3A girls</strong></p>
<p>North Allegheny was the first school ever to have its divers finish 1-2-3 in the WPIAL Class 3A championships.</p>
<p>That’s impressive.</p>
<p>That being said, it pales a bit in comparison considering that North Penn finished 1-2-3-4 last year.</p>
<p>Not in its district. In the state.</p>
<p>North Penn lost three-time state champion Paige Burrell and third-place finisher Kianna Yancey, but sill brought back senior and 2019 runner-up Meghan Wenzel and senior and No. 4 Madalyn Freece.</p>
<p>Yet both 2019 medalists are seeded behind Tigers freshman Christina Shi, who had the top score in the state with a school-record 531.30 in the WPIAL finals. North Allegheny also has junior Maya Ennis, the WPIAL runner-up and the 13th-place finisher from last year seeded fourth and freshman Zoe Ky seeded seventh.</p>
<p>Ky was the top seed heading into the WPIAL finals but finished third.</p>
<p>No WPIAL diver has won girls Class 3A since Maria Lohman of Chartiers Valley took home her third crown in 2015. The four-year WPIAL drought is tied for the longest in the classification since the PIAA diving competition began in 1973.</p>
<p><strong>Class 3A boys</strong></p>
<p>David Manelis was the top WPIAL finisher at the 2019 PIAA Class 3A diving finals when he moved from the fourth seed in the district to No. 2 in the state.</p>
<p>This year, the Fox Chapel junior heads into the state finals as the No. 3 seed in the meet after a 524.90 at the WPIAL championships. He sits behind Emmaus senior and defending champion Brendan McCourt (562.70) and sophomore Conor Gesing of Abington (553.45), who finished fourth a year ago.</p>
