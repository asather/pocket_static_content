<p>Given the community spread already in the United States and other countries, Allegheny County can “expect” to see cases of COVID-19 “in the next coming weeks,” a county health official said Monday.</p>
<p>Dr. Kristen Mertz, Allegheny County Health Department medical epidemiologist, told reporters during a press conference Monday morning that “Pittsburgh is not one of the highest risk” areas of the country “just because we have less international travel than places like New York and California.”</p>
<p>“But I won’t say it’s not possible” that COVID-19 could already have been circulating in the county, she added.&nbsp;“And we do expect to see cases in the next coming weeks for sure.”</p>
<p>Her comments came during an interview with reporters following a press conference called by county health officials to try to demonstrate to the public that they are as ready as they can be if and when COVID-19 cases occur in the county.</p>
<p>“There has been a lot of work going on behind the scenes at the health department to assure that we are prepared for a possible outbreak,” said Dr. Lee Harrison, chair of the board of health.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison was joined at the press conference by Dr. Mertz, Dr. LuAnn Brink, the county’s chief epidemiologist, Wendell Hissrich, Pittsburgh’s public safety director, and Matt Brown, the county’s chief of emergency services and fire marshal.</p>
<p>Dr. Mertz and Dr. Brink repeated the very basic steps that are recommended for people to try to prevent themselves from becoming infected and from spreading the virus if they do become infected, recommendations identical to try to avoid the flu: Stay home if you are sick; wash your hands regularly; clean commonly touched surfaces with a disinfectant; sneeze or cough into a tissue and then throw the tissue away; if you don’t have a tissue, cough into the crook of your elbow; if you think you are sick, don’t just go to a doctor’s office, urgent care or emergency room, call ahead so you can be evaluated first before possibly spreading the virus into a healthcare setting.</p>
<p>“At this time there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania,” Dr. Mertz said. “But we do expect to see some as we expand testing.”</p>
<p>The state Department of Health said it expects to begin running tests at its state lab in Exton, Pa., by Friday, March 6, Nate Wardle, state Department of Health spokesman, said in an email.</p>
