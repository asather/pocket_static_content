<h1>Pirates offer constant reminder of volatility of pitching</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In one of his more honest, funny and quirky answers while speaking with local reporters via Zoom on Tuesday, Steven Brault called throwing a baseball overhand with maximum effort “dumb.”</p>
<p>Some of Brault’s Pirates teammates may use other four-letter words to describe what they’ve experienced while pitching, but Brault’s point was plenty clear: Chucking a ball overhand is an unnatural act, one that produces injuries and an eventual need to adjust.</p>
<p>The Pirates don’t have to look very far to find examples of this either, with much of their 2020 success hinging on the hopes of guys who’ve incurred arm injuries and tweaked a few things while working their way back.</p>
<p>Brault has dealt with shoulder issues twice in the past calendar year, leading to a streamlined delivery. Chad Kuhl, who could <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/07/steven-brault-chad-kuhl-pirates-fifth-starter-competition/stories/202007070086" target="_blank">team with Brault</a> to occupy a rotation spot, is coming off Tommy John surgery. He, too, has fixed a few mechanical flaws.</p>
<p>Nick Burdi, a hard-thrower who could become a key piece in the bullpen, had surgery last year to correct symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome. Even closer Keone Kela missed some time with arm issues before returning and pitching lights out.</p>
<p>Together, that group will have to overcome the loss of Jameson Taillon (second Tommy John) and Chris Archer (thoracic outlet syndrome) for the year due to their own arm issues.</p>
<p>“We believe that we have a good, healthy group of pitchers who have a chance to be effective at the major league level this year,” Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said last month.</p>
<p>How some of these pitchers have fixed what ailed them — literally — has been a fascinating process.</p>
<p>Brault on Tuesday talked about how he used the time down to pick apart his mechanics — shifting his arm angle and increasing the support offered by his stride leg. They’re smart changes. They speak to how seriously Brault took his rehab, but they’re also a little like equipment in football — something can still happen.</p>
<p>Any adjustment made at this point is hardly easy. These guys have thrown a baseball a certain way for years and probably decades.</p>
<p>Now, in a period of days, weeks or months they’re going to change?</p>
<p>Taillon encountered something similar during his rehab process, when he has tried to shorten his arm path to better insulate his elbow. Smart move, and it should help. Yet it’s not exactly like flicking a light switch.</p>
<p>“The way I’ve been throwing my whole life was getting me hurt,” Taillon said. “If you were to put a ball in my hand and tell me to throw, I would have thrown my old way.”</p>
<p>An interest in mechanical changes sparked Taillon’s curiosity. He looked at guys like Shane Bieber and Lucas Giolito and noticed that they didn’t sacrifice life on their fastball because their arm path was shorter — almost like that of a catcher.</p>
<p>In fact, Taillon was jealous. They’ve stayed on the field. He has not. So Taillon stripped everything to the ground and rebuilt it from scratch. Now, he said if he picks up a ball, he’s going to throw it a smarter way.</p>
<p>“I think I would throw in that shorter, cleaner method,” Taillon said. “I think the results are going to be pretty nice, too. I think I’m going to have some added deception that I never had before.</p>
<p>“Making a mechanical change when you’re at the highest level is scary. It’s tough. But it’s something that I had to do.”</p>
<p>The idea of throwing a baseball can also be a head game. Pitchers such as Joe Musgrove or Kela like to screw around at shortstop during batting practice because it makes them feel athletic, but it also helps with their arm action, delivering quick, rhythmic throws with pop.</p>
<p>Burdi experienced similar things while training with Matt Hopkins and John DeRouin at Hops Sports Performance in Coventry, R.I. His rehab process included plenty of discussion about better protecting his arm and eliminating stress on his neck and elbow — the root of many TOS issues — but the trick would become maintaining that under adverse conditions.</p>
<p>So Burdi would increase his heart rate and blast some music to simulate game-like conditions, and the Pirates reliever would focus on maintaining proper form.</p>
<p>“That was was one of the big things that we focused on,” Burdi said. “When I start to get going and I start losing everything we've worked on, how can we get back before we fall into old habits.”</p>
<p>The need for Burdi to bounce back has increased due to the loss of Edgar Santana over a PED suspension. He, Richard Rodriguez and Michael Feliz should most frequently bridge the gap between that day’s starting pitcher and the back end of the bullpen of Kyle Crick and Kela.</p>
<p>In the starting rotation, the most important bounce-back case is undoubtedly Kuhl, who has the stuff to be an elite starter but simply hasn’t been on the mound enough to show it.</p>
<p>Although catcher Jacob Stallings said Kuhl was a little tentative during spring training 1.0, he’s seemingly been letting it rip thus far in summer camp. The right-hander apparently went to work on his curveball during the rehab process, giving him two very good breaking balls and an elite fastball.</p>
<p>The only trick now is avoiding another four-letter word.</p>
<p>“He looks really good,” Brault said of Kuhl. “I’m pretty psyched to see what he's going to do this year.”</p>
