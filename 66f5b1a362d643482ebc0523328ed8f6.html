<h1>Brookline group to use nearly $20,000 grant to create community garden, apiary </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An overgrown corner lot in residential Brookline could soon be blooming and buzzing with honeybees, thanks to a city neighborhood grant.</p>
<p>Brookline Together plans to use its $19,995 Urban Redevelopment Authority Neighborhood Initiative Fund award to transform a vacant, undermined lot&nbsp;at the corner of Jacob and Whited streets — just off Route 51 near the South Busway — into a community garden and apiary by next year.</p>
<p>“It’s very craggy, and there’s not an entry point from the street. There’s a lot we need to do to make it a usable space,” said Caitlin McNulty, president of the community group.</p>
<p>The project was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2020/02/04/URA-Hazelwood-Homewood-commercial-kitchen-Bible-Center-Church-Grants-Neighborhoods/stories/202002040144" target="_blank">one of 18 to receive the URA neighborhood</a>&nbsp;funding.</p>
<p>The group plans to begin installing electric and water lines in April, as well as grade and remediate the 1-acre plot that has abandoned mines underneath.</p>
<p>The goal is to open the community garden plots for operation by spring 2021.</p>
<p>Trees will be planted around the perimeter&nbsp;“to make sure that we’re not disrupting the habitat of the animals living in that space and kind of create a barrier from the road,” Ms. McNulty said.</p>
<p>The project is seven years in the making. The urban beekeeping nonprofit Burgh Bees has a permit to install up to 43 beehives on the land.</p>
<p>The hives are expected to be installed by fall, and community members interested in beekeeping can lease them for $75 a year.</p>
<p>“It’s a particularly good spot because you have the [nearby] Mount Washington green zone, and you have the rivers, which have been a good food supply for the honeybees.There’s a lot of biodiversity there,” said Jeff Shaw, Burgh Bees president. “Their diets mostly consist of a protein and a carbohydrate — Protein is the pollen from flowers, and the carbohydrate is the flower nectar.”</p>
<p>Honeybees generally fly 3 to 4 miles in any direction from the hive, he said.</p>
<p>Burgh Bees has trained 1,300 urban beekeepers in the last decade, and the South Hills location will be its third, as the organization also manages apiaries in Homewood and Cranberry.</p>
<p>Ms. McNulty said that along with honeybees, gardening and food education will be a large component at the site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scout troops are expected to use the space for insect observation and gardening merit badges, both she and Mr. Shaw said.</p>
<p>Teens from the Brookline Teen Outreach, another nonprofit that Ms. McNulty runs, will grow produce for cooking instruction or donation to local food panties.</p>
<p>The plot is located away from the neighborhood’s main business district on Brookline Boulevard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It is right by the busway,” Ms. McNulty said. “We were thinking this could add more access for people. On Brookline Boulevard, you have options at the ready; on this side of the neighborhood, there’s nothing.”</p>
<p>Brookline Together is one year into its 100-year lease on the city-owned lot.</p>
