<h1>Man charged in Westmoreland County child rapes 15 years apart</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police in Westmoreland County on Friday arrested an accused child rapist whose alleged sex crimes, they say, stretched over a 19-year period and involved victims between 12 and 50 years old.</p>
<p>After charging Eric A. Wright in three cases, investigators said they believe he might be responsible for untold other sexual crimes and are asking anyone with knowledge about other potential victims to contact them.</p>
<p>“Given the fact that the investigation showed this behavior or the assaults occurred over such a long frame of time beginning in 2000 to present, to think that there are only three people out there who are victims, it would seem to be premature to close this,” Allegheny Township police Chief Duane Fisher said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When you look at the brazenness or the extremeness of the offenses over the time — basically open lewdness, or exposing himself, to forcible rape — you know this is not something he’s just dabbled with.”</p>
<p>Blaine Jones, Mr. Wright’s attorney, said his client denies any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“Mr. Wright categorically and comprehensively denies these allegations,” Mr. Jones said. “I would hope that the public at large would reserve judgment until Mr. Wright has his day in court.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wright, 47, of Leechburg, surrendered to police Friday morning and was arraigned a short time later on 23 different charges involving three alleged victims.</p>
<p>District Judge Cheryl Peck-Yakopec set bail in the two rape cases at $500,000 each and in the open lewdness case at $50,000. Mr. Wright was sent to the Westmoreland County Prison</p>
<p>Mr. Jones said his client was disappointed by the high bond. He said that his client does not have any criminal history of which he is aware, and he noted that Mr. Wright turned himself in voluntarily within 24 hours of police making arrangements with Mr. Jones.</p>
<p>The case began in October when a 12-year-old and her mother went to the police station to report that the child had been sexually assaulted between June and October by Mr. Wright, who is listed in police paperwork as 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds. Police charged Mr. Wright in that case with rape and numerous other felonies.</p>
<p>Chief Fisher said that first case led investigators to the other two alleged victims through&nbsp;“good police work, talking to neighbors, family members, working through to find different leads.”</p>
<p>A second alleged victim told investigators that Mr. Wright had raped and otherwise sexually assaulted her between 2000 and 2004 when she was a teenager. She said she was raped in 2004.</p>
<p>A third woman told police that Mr. Wright exposed himself to a woman over the summer at her Vandergrift office.</p>
