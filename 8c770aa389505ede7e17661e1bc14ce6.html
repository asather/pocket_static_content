<p>You might be able to add another Steelers great to the Hall party in 2021.</p>
<p>Bill Nunn Jr., one of the architects of the Super Bowl-winning teams of the 1970s, has been selected as a finalist for induction as a contributor, the Pro Football Hall of Fame announced Tuesday. Nunn was a renowned scout, to be sure, but is best known for being ahead of his time with how he helped mine talent from Historically Black Colleges and Universities.</p>
<p>“You cannot write the history of the Pittsburgh Steelers without Bill Nunn,” Hall of Fame cornerback Mel Blount said in 2014 at the time of Nunn’s death. “When you look at the Steelers of the 1970s, none of that would have happened without Bill Nunn.”</p>
<p>The Steelers were set to see Bill Cowher, Troy Polamalu and Donnie Shell enshrined in Canton this year, but the ceremony was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now the plan is for both the 2020 and 2021 classes to be inducted together next year in a multi-day celebration.</p>
<p>Nunn, a sportswriter at the Pittsburgh Courier before his scouting career elevated him to assistant director of player personnel, got the nod from the Hall’s contributor committee. He was the only one of 10 semifinalists in the contributor category to get this far and now will need at least 80% of the vote when the overall selection committee meets at the 2021 Super Bowl.</p>
