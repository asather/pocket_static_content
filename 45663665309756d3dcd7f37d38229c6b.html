<h1>Butler will play in District 10 for football</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Butler High School decided two weeks ago to leave the WPIAL for football only, and the school’s initial plan was to play an independent schedule.</p>
<p>But it turns out that Butler will still have a chance to be involved in district playoffs. Those playoffs will just be in the Erie area.</p>
<p>Butler has been accepted into District 10 as an associate member for football only. Butler will be given a District 10 schedule and be eligible for the District 10 Class 6A playoffs in 2020.</p>
<p>“They have not decided what the format is going to be for the playoffs,” Butler athletic director Bill Mylan said. “I’m not sure how it is going to play out with the playoffs. We’re just happy there is that possibility of playing in the postseason down the road. We’re not going to jump to thinking we’re going to win District 10. But it’s nice for us to have the incentive and something to play for.”</p>
<p>Butler decided to drop out of the WPIAL because the football program has struggled mightily for more than two decades. Although it is the third-largest school in the WPIAL in terms of enrollment, Butler had only 40 players come out for the team last season and only 24 players were dressing for games late in the season.</p>
<p>Butler hasn’t won a game the past two seasons and is 41-149 since 2000. The school was worried about the program folding, so it decided to leave the WPIAL for football in hopes of playing a schedule that might make the team more competitive. Butler asked the WPIAL if it could join District 10 for football only, but the WPIAL board of directors denied the request, saying it would set a bad precedent. But at the urging of Butler, the WPIAL relented and informed District 10 that it was OK for Butler to play in District 10 for one sport while playing in the WPIAL in everything else.</p>
<p>“Things finally got worked out and District 10 had a meeting on Wednesday for football alignments for next season,” Mylan said. “I got an email from District 10 Wednesday night saying we were accepted as an associate member.”</p>
<p>District 10 only has two other Class 6A teams — Erie High School and McDowell. Mylan said Butler will play those two teams, one Class 5A team and two Class 4A teams. Butler will likely play perennial power Erie Cathedral Prep. Butler can then schedule up to five other games against teams from outside of District 10.</p>
<p>Mylan said Butler will play a “Week 0” game against Kiski Area and also has verbal agreements to play two Pittsburgh City League teams (Westinghouse and Brashear) along with Hollidaysburg of District 6.</p>
