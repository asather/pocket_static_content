<h1>When the manufacturing work dried up, W. Pa. firms turned to making medical equipment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While the COVID-19 pandemic strangled most American manufacturers in mid-April, business was booming for Butler Technologies Inc. The company produces an array of labels, wearable tech and “membrane switches,” the thin layers of buttons you might find on a keypad.</p>
<p>Two uses for those switches: turning ventilators and powered respirators on and off.</p>
<p>The need for ventilators exploded in recent months, as they’re often the last defense for patients battling COVID-19. Going all-in on the medical equipment space proved to be an effective strategy for a number of southwestern Pennsylvania manufacturers when demand for their typical products came to a halt.</p>
<p>In the case of Butler Technologies, orders for the switches nearly quadrupled in April —&nbsp;vaulting the Butler-based company to record months in April and May. Revenue grew by 30% from the first quarter to the second, said director of finance Jason Hillwig.</p>
<p>“I don't know if you want to call it fortunate, but in these types of times, some companies do well because of the type of product they manufacture —&nbsp;and we were one of those companies,” he said. The company grew from 61 employees in March to 75 in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That success isn’t replicable for everyone; Butler Technologies had the right products at the right time. But other Pennsylvania manufacturers are using their niches to lean into the medical equipment space, even if they haven’t returned to pre-pandemic profit levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, Marshall-based Magee Plastics was having its “best year yet,” tracking nearly $21 million in sales, said its president, Charles Story. But for a company that produces and assembles a variety of aircraft interior components —&nbsp;sidewall panels, window shades and magazine racks — and sells to companies like Boeing, Airbus, Douglas and Fokker,&nbsp;expectations were stymied by widespread flight cancellations.</p>
<p>In April, sales dipped to 19% of what they were at the same point last year. When the coronavirus began taking hold, Mr. Story tried to keep the company’s composure.</p>
<p>“Back in the middle of March we promised everybody when this thing first started that we wouldn't lay anybody off for 12 weeks,” he said.</p>
<p>But the pandemic’s effects on demand have lasted longer than expected. Those 12 weeks elapsed, and Magee Plastics laid off 10 of its 103 employees on June 19.</p>
<p>The situation reminds Mr. Story of the 9/11 era, when a near-$4 million backlog in orders dried up within days as flights were grounded following the terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Back then, the &nbsp;company briefly pivoted into commercial lighting products. These days, it’s making “COVID boxes” with the help of local health networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Mr. Story, one Magee employee saw some plastic personal protective equipment on Facebook —&nbsp;a cube that goes around a patient’s head during a cough-laden intubation session. The box could protect everyone else in the vicinity from viral aerosols.</p>
<p>The company reached out to area health care providers to see if there was a need for such a device, and Allegheny Health Network responded, sending chief anesthesiologist Dr. John P. Lawrence to help design a product. After a couple of iterations, the team created the “Magee Aerosol Shield.”</p>
<p>Magee will produce 350 of the boxes — 200 for AHN and 150 for other regional health networks — partially funded through a $150,000 grant from the Richard King Mellon Foundation.</p>
<p>Business isn’t back to where it used to be. Mr. Story said June 2020 sales are about half of what they were last year, and there’s plenty of product still “sitting on shelves.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, for Magee and others, the R.K. Mellon grants are playing a critical role in accelerating production of PPE while keeping local manufacturers afloat. The foundation pledged $15 million to COVID-19 relief in April, then added another $10 million to the commitment on Thursday.</p>
<p>Another recipient of the foundation’s first round of grants was Abram’s Nation in Hampton, which manufactures products for families with special needs. The company is known for its&nbsp;“Safety Sleeper,” a mesh tent-like apparatus with a bed inside that prevents children from wandering off at night unattended and reduces visual stimuli.</p>
<p>It’s a smaller, family-focused company, with just 14 employees before the coronavirus. Now founder Rose Morris is getting $35,000 in grants to bring on seven new seamstresses, purely for mask production.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ms. Morris and her expanded team of 21 are helping with Highmark Health’s recent endeavor to make 1 million masks for local first responders and businesses. Their task: Produce about 20,000 masks per week until the end of September.</p>
<p>“It’s not good business because I’m not making a profit on that. But it’s good business because I’m helping our community, and I’m helping other businesses to stay open,” Ms. Morris said.</p>
<p>Prior to the new assignment, Abram’s Nation had been making PPE within its niche. In early March, Ms. Morris and others in the company began producing custom masks, with tighter weaves, antimicrobial properties, and clear vinyl sections over the mouth.</p>
<p>“Clear front masks are sought after in the special needs market,” said Ms. Morris. “We saw it for the hearing-impaired. If you’re deaf and you’re reading lips, you’re really handicapped with a mask on.”</p>
<p>Demand for the clear front masks popped up in adjacent areas, like day cares and child therapy. The masks muffle the voice a bit, but a bit more face time goes a long way.</p>
<p>“We have some friends who, once things opened up, took their kids back to see the therapist, and the child was afraid because they didn’t know who the person was,” she said.</p>
<p>So far, Abram’s Nation has provided masks to nonprofit Global Links, pediatric care facility Sensory Link and the DePaul School for Hearing and Speech, along with the Abram’s distributor&nbsp;in England, some local businesses and families across the country.</p>
<p>The company donated the first 1,000 masks before beginning sales. Ms. Morris said the company has made “tens of thousands of dollars” on their specially made masks, which go for $19 apiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Ms. Morris had been expecting a 25% boost in 2020 sales at the beginning of this year. Those expectations have since been tempered, but she isn’t complaining. Growth isn’t the priority right now; it’s about survival.</p>
<p>“Flat is the new amazing, I guess,” she said.</p>
