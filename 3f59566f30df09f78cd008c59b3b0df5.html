<h1>Diocese aims to resume public Mass on June 1</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Catholic churches in the Diocese of Pittsburgh would resume public Masses in June for the first time in 2½ months under goals announced Thursday by the diocese.</p>
<p>While describing the timetable as a goal rather than a certainty, the diocese said it would provide more details on Friday for what that reopening will look like.</p>
<p>“The diocese will look to return to the public celebration of the Holy Mass, starting with daily Masses on Monday, June 1” with “a goal of recommencing weekend Masses the weekend of June 6 and 7,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The diocese will also, in the meantime, be easing restrictions on activities in five of its six counties as of Friday. On that date, Allegheny, Butler, Greene and Washington counties will join Lawrence as among the counties listed by the state of Pennsylvania in the&nbsp;“yellow” zone, meaning some restrictions will be eased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Churches in those counties can be used for weddings, funerals and baptisms attended by 25 people or less, and they can be open for individual private prayer, with people using sanitizer, masks and social distancing.</p>
<p>But full public Masses would remain closed to the public at least until June 1, while continuing to be livestreamed.</p>
<p>Public Masses have been canceled since mid-March.</p>
<p>“Diocesan leadership will assist and support pastors as they make decisions on reopening based on government guidelines specific to their county, as well as their own assessment of the ability to meet all necessary health and safety requirements including wearing masks and honoring social distancing requirements,” the diocese said.</p>
<p>The diocese’s sixth county, Beaver, remains in the most restrictive “red” phase.</p>
