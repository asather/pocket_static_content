<h1>Gov. Wolf and PIAA will decide fate of WPIAL spring sports</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For any high school athlete who plays a spring sport in the WPIAL, the fate of your season won’t be determined by the WPIAL. The future of all spring sports are in the hands of Gov. Tom Wolf and the PIAA.</p>
<p>The WPIAL board of directors met Monday, and one of the items on the agenda was to discuss the future of spring sports because of COVID-19 concerns. The discussion took place behind closed doors at the league office in Green Tree.</p>
<p>But after the meeting, WPIAL associate executive director Amy Scheuneman let it be known that the WPIAL will not decide when, if at all, spring sports will be allowed to start. The WPIAL falls under the governance of the PIAA, and PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi said Monday, “We’re in a holding pattern, waiting for information from the governor’s office.”</p>
<p>Gov. Wolf ordered the shutdown of all Pennsylvania schools until March 30. It is certainly possible that schools might be closed into April, or longer. The Upper St. Clair School District announced Monday that all schools are closed until April 13.</p>
<p>Scheuneman said the board briefly discussed possible plans if spring sports start again. She wouldn’t say what those plans included, but said, “The PIAA obviously is aligning with the governor, as are we. Once we know more about when we’ll be back in schools, we’ll be able to start to formulate our next steps. We would follow suit with the PIAA, based on what information they give us.”</p>
<p>Baseball and softball teams were scheduled to start playing games March 20. But that won’t happen. Scheuneman said the WPIAL is neither optimistic nor pessimistic about whether there will be a spring sports season. Scheuneman said there is no deadline date for when spring sports would have to start for the WPIAL to have some kind of season, even if it is abbreviated.</p>
<p>Besides the delay of spring sports, the PIAA also postponed the finish of its boys and girls basketball tournaments and the Class 2A swimming and diving championships.</p>
<p>“It’s hard because everyone wants answers,” Scheuneman said. “Nobody has an answer. To try and give you an answer would be shortsighted on our part. That would be saying we know more than the medical experts, who don’t know themselves what’s going to happen.”</p>
<p>The WPIAL and PIAA, however, made it quite clear Monday that teams, spring or winter, are not permitted to have informal practices away from school just because schools are shut down. Practices run by players also are not permitted. The PIAA and WPIAL both put a release on their web sites about the practices.</p>
<p>“The gatherings themselves are contrary to what the state is trying to accomplish, as far as limiting gatherings and staying isolated,” Scheuneman said.</p>
<p>High school athletes all across Pennsylvania are hoping to have some kind of spring sports season. Emi Curcio, a senior softball player at Frazier High School in the WPIAL, started an online petition Friday to the PIAA entitled, “Dear PIAA Please Do Not Terminate Our Sports Seasons.” As of Monday night, the petition had 60,000 signatures.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of student athletes obviously is our priority,” Scheuneman said. “At the same time, we value high school athletics. That’s why we do what we do. We’re going to keep every hope that we’ll have something [in spring sports], but we certainly cannot guarantee it.”</p>
<p>If spring sports are canceled, it could affect the WPIAL financially. The board of directors were given a report Monday that showed attendance at the basketball and wrestling playoffs had increased from a year ago. That meant a little more in gate revenues. The WPIAL shares 50% of gate revenues with schools that participate in the football, soccer and basketball playoffs. But the WPIAL is holding those shares this year.</p>
<p>“If we don’t have spring sports, they may be held to offset the budget,” Scheuneman said. “We’re holding those [shares] until we know what the spring holds.”</p>
<p>In other WPIAL matters:</p>
<p>• Vince Sortino was hired as assistant to the executive director. Sortino will start the job July 1.</p>
<p>Sortino is in his second year as athletic director at Dallastown in eastern Pennsylvania. Before that, he was Baldwin’s athletic director for 12 years before his job was eliminated.</p>
<p>• The league approved Cooper Vance eligible for spring sports at Mohawk High School after transferring from East Palestine in Ohio. The WPIAL made its ruling after a hearing Monday. East Palestine had indicated to the WPIAL that it thought Vance transferred for athletic reasons, which is against WPIAL and PIAA rules.</p>
<p>• The WPIAL still hasn’t approved sectional alignment for boys and girls basketball for the next two seasons. The league is waiting to see if the PIAA basketball tournaments will be concluded. The results of the tournament could affect a few WPIAL teams that might change classifications based on the PIAA’s new competition formula.</p>
