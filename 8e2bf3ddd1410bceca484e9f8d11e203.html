<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>James Conner is helping to make unforgettable memories for someone who sacrificed for his country.</p>
<p>The Steelers running back on Thursday announced he has partnered with the Air Force Sergeants Association and USAA to present Chief Louis Boykin with two tickets to this year’s Super Bowl on Feb. 2.</p>
<p>“With over three decades of military service to his name, Command Chief Master Sergeant Louis Boykin is someone our country owes a debt of gratitude to,” Conner said in a press release. “I am honored to team up with USAA and the AFSA to provide a trip to the Super Bowl to recognize Chief Boykin’s honorable military career and am looking forward to meeting him in Miami.”</p>
<p>Boykin plans to go to the game on Feb. 2 with his wife, Dolores. Though he has lived in Philadelphia for quite a while, Boykin <a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/steelers-james-conner-gives-trip-to-super-bowl-to-military-veteran/30551668" target="_blank">roots for both</a> the Steelers and Eagles.</p>
<p>USAA also expressed how honored it was to work with Conner on this noble endeavor.</p>
<p>Last month, two fellow Steelers — defensive end Cam Heyward and cornerback Joe Haden —<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/12/17/nfl-super-bowl-giveaway-steelers-cam-heyward-joe-haden-donta-green-ed-dawson/stories/201912170175" target="_blank"> teamed up to surprise</a> two western Pennsylvania high school football coaches with Super Bowl tickets.</p>
<p>Even if the Steelers themselves won’t be in Miami for the big game, at least they’ll have played a part in making sure Pittsburgh is represented by a few deserving folks.</p>
