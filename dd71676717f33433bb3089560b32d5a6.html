<h1>Democratic candidates make final push for votes in New Hampshire</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is in New Hampshire, as the Democratic presidential hopefuls engage in the last full day of campaigning on Tuesday before the nation’s first primary of the election season happens later in the night.</p>
<p>Here’s the latest:</p>

<p><strong>Candidates try to build up some last-minute excitement</strong></p>
<p>Democratic presidential candidates are traveling the state to fire up their canvassers, rally their supporters (in one case, with the help of an iconic garage rock band) and cajole the significant chunk of voters here who say they haven't fully committed to a candidate.</p>
<p>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has widened his lead in the final days of polling, will stop by his field office in Hudson to launch a canvass, then join New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and The Strokes for a rally at Whittemore Center Arena, the home of the University of New Hampshire hockey team in Durham. Mr. Sanders won Durham in the 2016 primary by nearly three-to-one over Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, coming off a narrow win in the Iowa caucuses barring a recanvass, has a full day of events before making a final stop in Exeter for a rally at Exeter High School. In a final tracking poll released by CNN Monday, Mr. Buttigieg was in second place, seven points behind Mr. Sanders.</p>
<p>Also in Exeter for a rally this afternoon is Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who rose to 14 percent in a WBZ/Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll this weekend. Though she registered at 7 percent in CNN's poll, it noted that her number was closer to 11 percent in surveys completed since Friday night's Democratic debate.</p>
<p>Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who round out the top five in recent polls, are also sweeping the state for a series of town halls and canvass launches.</p>
