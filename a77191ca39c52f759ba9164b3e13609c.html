<h1>For Pitt, delayed class start in January will mean no spring break week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Spring semester will start eight days later than planned for the University of Pittsburgh’s 34,000 students due to the pandemic, with a condensed schedule meaning no week-long spring break but a term conclusion date unchanged.</p>
<p>“It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue through the winter months,” Provost Ann Cudd said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The first day of classes will be Jan. 19, instead of Jan. 11, Ms. Cudd wrote students, faculty and staff i<a href="https://officeoftheprovost.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/j/402252A47DF888C52540EF23F30FEDED/732D8D385C0BB9D34E9AB52EF5D51DA2" target="_blank">n a message</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have created a compressed schedule, which eliminates spring recess to maximize the health and safety of our community but includes the addition of two student self-care days and ends the term as originally scheduled on May 1,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Pitt made the decision after consulting campus medical and academic representatives, including faculty, and deans, as well as student representatives. It affects students on Pitt’s main campus and branches in Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown and Titusville.</p>
<p>As of Monday, Pitt reported that the&nbsp;5-day moving average of positive cases per day went from 4.4 to 5.2.&nbsp;Eighteen students have tested positive since Friday.</p>
<p>Thirty-three student cases are active in isolation. The cumulative total since Aug. 1 is 247.</p>
<p>Pitt plans to continue with its hybrid learing approach, dubbed Flex@Pitt enabling students and instructors to decide how they wish to learn and teach, with the share of in-person classes</p>
