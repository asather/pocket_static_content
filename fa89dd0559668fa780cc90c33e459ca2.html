<h1>Local election officials successfully pull off primary during pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The statewide primary election that sent county officials across Pennsylvania into a monthslong, all-hands-on-deck bureaucratic blitz was successfully administered on Tuesday in Allegheny County.</p>
<p>And though there were a few instances of social distancing faux pas, mask-wearing violations and long lines at polling places —&nbsp;one of which triggered a court-ordered voting extension —&nbsp;workers were able to count almost all of the county’s mail-in and absentee ballots by midnight and had received all but one ballot box from in-person polling places.</p>
<p>As of 11:30 p.m., the county had scanned and tallied about 187,000 votes, encompassing most of the 207,000-plus mail-in and absentee votes it received and a small number of votes from in-person polling places. It was the result of a 14-hour, multi-step counting process, administered by more than 100 employees in a guarded warehouse on the North Side amid fears that their operation wouldn’t be quick enough to open thousands of envelopes and scan thousands of ballots on new machines.</p>
<p>It was an effort complicated, too, by the significant consolidation of in-person polling places, designed to alleviate anticipated poll worker shortages but mandated to open for those who chose not to submit a mail-in ballot or faced problems doing so.</p>
<p>At times, the county’s attempt to safely administer the in-person election faced challenges from conduct at individual polling sites —&nbsp;which had been given guidance on how to keep voters safe and the election secure, but were tested as specific circumstances arose.</p>
<p>The line was so long at the Penn Hills Public Library as polls were about to close at 8 p.m. that attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union pushed Election Court to keep the polling place open for an additional hour —&nbsp;a request that was approved. Anyone waiting in line at 9 p.m. was permitted to vote, but could not be waiting in their vehicles, the judge ruled.</p>
<p>“It was bumper to bumper,” said Kelly Foglia, a home health caregiver who tried to vote at the library three times but was met with huge lines of cars and voters trying to enter.</p>
<p>Elsewhere across the county, most anecdotal complaints arose from lines and confusion about mask-wearing and social distancing —&nbsp;and in one case, resulted in a scuffle in which a voter was tackled by a constable. In another case, a poll worker was removed after colleagues complained that she was not properly maintaining six-feet physical distancing.</p>
<p>But it was a fine line between incidents that were preventable and those that were a natural result of holding elections in the midst of a pandemic, which also threatened to delay the results of close races.</p>
<p>When polls opened at 7 a.m. and elections officials in the warehouse were able to start tallying mail-in and absentee votes, they faced a locked roomful of ballots —&nbsp;more than 185,000 in total, to start —&nbsp;that they’d have to extract from envelopes and put through new scanning machines. If done by a reasonable time after polls close, they’d be able to focus on the in-person ballot boxes, which were to be hand-delivered by officials from each polling place.</p>
<p>The workers also had to tally more than 50 large envelopes of ballots received by the county in the mail that day, as well as ballots that were dropped off in-person.</p>
<p>As of 11:30 p.m., every ballot box had been returned to the warehouse except for Pittsburgh’s fourth ward, which was on its way, a county spokeswoman said. Approximately 150 ballot boxes were still to be opened and scanned —&nbsp;as well as 5,000 to 10,000 mail-in and absentee ballots.</p>
<p>“All of the declaration envelopes have been opened at this point with those ballots being removed, flattened and back folded before being scanned,” spokeswoman Amie Downs said. “Four scanners are dedicated to the ballot boxes and four are dedicated to the mail-in/absentee ballots. All eight are running at this time.”</p>
<p>The more than 207,000 mail-in and absentee ballots the county received, in total, was framed as a comprehensive number, but complicated by Gov. Tom Wolf’s executive order this week that pushed back the deadline seven days for Allegheny County and five others to receive those ballots by mail for them to still be counted.</p>
<p>More than 280,000 had applied for mail-in and absentee ballots, but it remains to be seen how many who didn’t return theirs —&nbsp;about 73,000 —&nbsp;will utilize the governor’s extension. Some voted in person by provisional ballot.</p>
<p>Those who cast ballots in-person on Tuesday had a much different experience than elections past. Not only were their polling places changed or consolidated in many cases, but upon arrival, it looked disease-proofed. Tape marked the floors to maintain social distancing. Many poll workers wore masks. In some cases, only two or three voters were allowed to enter the building at a time.</p>
<p>Many of the complaints regarded confusion about mask-wearing policies.</p>
<p>Voters were strongly encouraged to wear masks covering their nose and mouth, but weren’t to be denied entrance if they didn’t.</p>
<p>An elections judge in Forest Hills said officials told one voter who didn’t want to wear a mask that she wouldn’t be allowed in. The voter “put one on,” the judge said.</p>
<p>At Allderdice High School, two poll workers reportedly not wearing masks prompted a complaint to the county as well.</p>
<p>“After a few reports of voters being turned away for not wearing masks, we contacted each polling place again to reiterate that voters can vote even if they do not wear a mask,” Ms. Downs said in an afternoon statement. “Poll workers, however, are expected to be wearing a mask, face shield, or some other face cover. If they are not willing to do so, they’ve been asked to leave the polling place.”</p>
<p>A dispute over a voter not wearing a mask led to a scuffle at Pittsburgh Allderdice School in Squirrel Hill, after a man yelled at campaign volunteers and began arguing with another voter who requested he put on a mask. A constable had to wrestle the man to the ground after being pushed up against a dumpster.</p>
<p>After about a dozen officers from the city police department and the Pittsburgh Public Schools arrived, the man was “advised to go vote and leave the premises,” county officials said. No charges were filed and no injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, a pregnant woman who voted in-person at Perry Traditional Academy said a majority of workers were wearing their masks incorrectly -- and that one worker in particular was not adhering to social distancing guidelines with her.</p>
<p>Ms. Downs said a separate female poll worker — a rover tasked with facilitating the flow of the election —&nbsp;was removed from that location in the last hour for not adhering to physical distance. Poll workers had complained about her, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, at the 11th ward location at Pittsburgh Fulton K-5 School in Highland Park, only six to 10 voters were allowed inside at a time and a long line developed —&nbsp;with some voters saying it was crowded in the polling place and difficult to social distance.</p>
<p>In Penn Hills, because of the consolidation of polling places, there was not enough parking at the library on Stotler Road to accommodate voters.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the ACLU were on the phone and in person at Election Court at 7:50 p.m. asking Judge Bruce R. Beemer to keep the polling place open.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the county did not object to the extension, said Mike Healy, who appeared in person before the court.</p>
<p>In the counties surrounding the Pittsburgh region, officials, too, had to grapple with an influx of mail-in ballots and the complications of administering an in-person election.</p>
<p>Butler County Commissioner Kim Geyer said that outside of a slow start at one of their 89 precincts Tuesday morning —&nbsp;and no one was turned away —&nbsp;everything had been running smoothly.</p>
<p>“The precincts have been steady all day long,” Ms. Geyer said. “It’s been good to see.”</p>
<p>Butler County, which has 129,785 registered voters, sent out 24,831 mail-in ballots. As of 7 p.m., 18,820 of those had been returned, and another 950 were awaiting pickup at the post office.</p>
<p>“I consider that number high,” Ms. Geyer said. “That’s a great turnout. It shows a lot of active interest by our voters.”</p>
<p>In Beaver County, elections director Dorene Mandity said turnout at the polls on Tuesday was really low, but that that number didn’t tell the whole story.</p>
<p>Her office mailed out 21,840 absentee ballots, and by 6:30 p.m., she’d received 18,550 of those.</p>
<p>“This is a high number,” Ms. Mandity said.</p>
<p>Beaver County will not begin to count those mail-in ballots, she continued, until Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Because the elections space there is limited, Ms. Mandity said, she didn’t want to try to cram precinct returns and other supplies in the same place — with all the workers — while trying to count ballots that were mailed in.</p>
<p>She hopes the process of counting will be done by Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>“I pray that’s all it takes,” Ms. Mandity said.</p>
