<h1>Riverhounds shut out another foe, notch fifth consecutive win</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Albert Dikwa’s 81st-minute goal delivered Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC’s fifth consecutive victory Saturday night at Segra Field in Leesburg, Va., 1-0 against feisty Loudoun United FC (1-9-3).</p>
<p>The Riverhounds (10-3-1) vaulted into first place in the USL Championship’s Eastern Conference with the win, which also was their fifth shutout in a row. They lead Group F by nine points with two matches to play, although Hartford Athletic has three matches in hand, so the Riverhounds likely cannot clinch a first-round home playoff match until at least next Saturday.</p>
<p>Danny Vitiello stopped two shots for his sixth win, all of which have been clean sheets. The Riverhounds defense also blocked three shots, including two early in the first half.</p>
