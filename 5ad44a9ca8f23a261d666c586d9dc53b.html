<p>About 12,000 utility customers remain without power Thursday morning, more than 24 hours after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2020/04/08/Severe-weather-Allegheny-Beaver-Butler-Washington-thunderstorm-warning/stories/202004080077" target="_blank">severe storms and strong winds hit Western Pennsylvania</a> and spawned a small tornado near Tarentum.</p>
<p>Duquesne Light was reporting about 10,000 of its customers were still without power in Allegheny and Beaver counties as of 4:30 a.m. West Penn Power reported 2,000 outages in Pittsburgh and the surrounding counties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The utility companies restored power to thousands since an early morning Wednesday storm knocked out power to more than 50,000 at its peak.</p>
<p>Winds gusted up to a record 75 mph at Pittsburgh International Airport, according to the National Weather Service.&nbsp;The Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down near Tarentum around 1:19 a.m Wednesday.</p>
