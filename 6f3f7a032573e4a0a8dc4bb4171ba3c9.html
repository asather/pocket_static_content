<h1>Port Authority expects two new payment options to be available early next year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority should have 15,000 ConnectBands available early next year for riders who want to tap their wrist on the farebox instead of using their ConnectCards.</p>
<p>And the agency also expects its riders to have the option to use a mobile app on their cell phones to&nbsp;pay fares about the same time.</p>
<p>The authority board recently authorized the purchase of 15,000 ConnectBands under a three-year contract with Electronic Data Magnetics Inc. worth $134,535. The new payment options are designed to supplement the prepaid ConnectCards, not replace them, said authority spokesman Adam Brandolph.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to providing other options for customers,” Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>The authority conducted a trial with 150 customers using the rubber bracelets in summer 2019. They generally liked the convenience of the bands but asked whether there could be some changes such as an adjustable size and different colors.</p>
<p>Although progress was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Bandolph said, the agency reviewed several suppliers before making a selection. The bands will be available sometime in the first three months next year in two sizes, but Mr. Brandolph wouldn’t discuss the color.</p>
<p>“That’s going to be a surprise,” Mr. Brandolph said, although he had noted previously that riders during the trial expressed an interest in the Pittsburgh’s black-and-gold sports colors.</p>
<p>There will be a charge for the bands, but the price hasn’t been determined yet. The test bands used in the trial would have cost the agency $3.25 each; riders pay $1 for a ConnectCard.</p>
<p>Additionally, Port Authority expects to have its mobile app available early next year, too. That will allow riders to pay fares using their cell phone, similar to the way event tickets are loaded to an app.</p>
<p>That also has been held up by the pandemic.</p>
