<h1>'That's why I'm here': TE Lucas Krull, Pitt's early enrollees confident as spring camp nears</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Less than a month away from spring ball, Pitt’s defensive hype train is chugging along with optimism. Optimism that’s justified.</p>
<p>With pretty much everyone coming back, Pitt’s defense has the <em>potential</em> to be a top-five unit in college football next year. But everyone from Pat Narduzzi to the Pitt student awaiting season ticket sales knows the assumed defensive improvement from great to elite won’t be enough on its own.</p>
<p>For Pitt to attain the kind of season it hopes to have in 2020 — to, let’s say, end the decade-long drought without a 10-win season — the Panthers’ offense has to go from sporadic to reliably competent. And to do that, Pitt will need a new target (or two or three) to emerge.</p>
<p>Perhaps look no further than the fresh faces that made their Pitt media debut late Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>After former Arizona State quarterback Joey Yellen talked a couple weeks ago, the rest of Pitt’s mid-year enrollees — six incoming freshmen and one grad transfer — spoke an hour before Pat Narduzzi’s national signing day press conference. It turned into a Q&amp;A about Narduzzi’s possible interest in succeeding mentor Mark Dantonio at Michigan State, speculation he eventually shot down.</p>
<p>That news overshadowed whatever else happened at the Panthers’ South Side facility on Wednesday. But the confidence bubbling beneath the surface from Pitt’s new offensive weapons shouldn’t go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Florida grad transfer tight end Lucas Krull came to Pitt to start. Wide receiver Jordan Addison, a four-star 2020 prospect per 247 Sports and three-star on Rivals, was told by Pitt’s staff that he has a chance to play from the jump. And incoming freshman Israel Abanikanda leaned into the crowded running back situation, saying, “I’m all about competition.”</p>
<p>In a very coach-speak answer, Narduzzi said all 20 of Pitt’s 2020 signees — 18 high schoolers, two transfers — have a shot to compete for immediate time. But those three, along with early enrollee wideout Aydin Henningham, are realistic contenders to contribute right away.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m here,” Krull said, when asked if Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett sold him on the tight end position being featured in the 2020 offense. “That’s the plan.”</p>
<p>Krull’s case is a bit different than Addison, Abanikanda and Henningham. The former Gator, who played sparingly in Gainesville despite his 6-foot-7 size and athleticism, came to Pitt as the assumed No. 1 at his position. He wouldn’t have joined the program otherwise, and he wouldn’t have signed if he had doubts about the tight end usage.</p>
<p>Krull cited Pitt offensive coordinator Mark Whipple’s tight end history — working with future NFL star Jimmy Graham at Miami and All-American pass-catcher Adam Breneman at UMass — as a reason why he picked Pitt. He also knew splitting time with Florida tight end Kyle Pitts, a Walter Camp Player of the Year semifinalist who had 54 catches and 649 yards in 2019, was less than ideal.</p>
<p>Now, anyone who watched last season knows that Whipple’s tight end reputation didn’t translate right away. In Whipple’s inaugural season as Pitt’s play-caller, Will Gragg and Rutgers grad transfer Nakia Griffin-Stewart, who are both out of eligibility and have moved on, combined for only 38 catches and 331 yards.</p>
<p>So, how did Narduzzi and Whipple — the first coaches to contact Krull when he entered his name in the portal — sell him on producing in an offense that wasn’t necessarily reliant on tight ends in 2019?</p>
<p>“You put the tape on and watch what our tight ends are doing, whether they made a play or didn’t make a play,” Narduzzi said, referencing Gragg and Griffin-Stewart’s drop issues. “I will say we had a heck of a lot more production out of our tight ends than we did a year ago. When you look at the comparison, it was really steep.”</p>
<p>“If you look at it, they targeted the tight end quite a bit,”&nbsp;Krull added. “ It’s just that you have to be able to make those plays and do what you can when you get the ball in your hands. Something I know I can bring to this team is getting the ball in space and doing a lot of things with it. That’s something I bring to the table.”</p>
<p>Addison could do that, too, at slot receiver. Whether he starts right away like Krull is up in the air; Pitt loses its electric security blanket in Maurice Ffrench, but still returns Taysir Mack, Shocky Jacques-Louis and Jared Wayne, all of whom primarily worked on the outside but could slide into the slot.</p>
<p>Regardless, Addison has already impressed.</p>
<p>“You watch Jordan Addison run,” Narduzzi said. “Our guys are saying, ‘Coach, he may be like maybe our fastest receiver.’ Shockey will say there’s no way. But there’s a guy that can help you right away based on a deficiency with Maurice Ffrench going.”</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Addison said he looks up to Ffrench, whose 96 catches not only broke Larry Fitzgerald’s single-season receptions mark but also led the ACC in 2019. And Henningham — a Florida kid who’s admittedly still getting acclimated to the cold — is settling in by taking to Mack’s tutoring.</p>
<p>“I’m just trying to follow in his footsteps,” Henningham added. “How they get him the ball, I could see myself doing that. But I’m trying to be better.”</p>
<p>Add in Abanikanda — “They need a home-run hitter,” he said, when asked about Pitt’s desire to establish some semblance of a running game in 2020 — and there was plenty of confidence to go around on Wednesday.</p>
<p>And not just because Narduzzi decided to stay.</p>
