<html><head><title>New year, new hope for Jeannette</title></head><body><p>As a child, Curtis Antoniak grew up a stone’s throw away from the former Jeannette Glass site.</p><p>His family owned a local convenience store and he delivered newspapers to the homes of factory&nbsp;workers who lived nearby.</p><p>But in 1983, along with many other manufacturing sites across the Midwest, Jeannette Glass&nbsp;closed its doors. The city of Jeannette suffered greatly as the population dwindled from 17,000 at&nbsp;its peak to approximately 9,400 today. The Jeannette Glass factory near the downtown area became an empty lot, and many storefronts in the city’s center remain shuttered.</p><p>“For the longest time I thought I’d never see this city restored to what it used to be,” said Mr. Antoniak,&nbsp;now the mayor of Jeanette. “But Elliott moving a new facility to the former Glass site changes&nbsp;everything.”</p><p>In March 2018, the Westmoreland County Industrial Development Corp. Board approved the&nbsp;purchase of the former Jeannette Glass site by the Elliott Group, a manufacturing company also&nbsp;headquartered in Jeannette. At its groundbreaking ceremony last month, Elliott pledged that a&nbsp;$60 million testing facility on this site will open its doors in July 2021.</p><p>Purchased in 2000 by the Ebara Corp., headquartered in Tokyo, the Elliott Group supplies turbines and&nbsp;compressors for liquefied natural gas plants.</p><p>This new facility, which will sit on the now grassy 13-acre property, will expand Elliott’s&nbsp;manufacturing capabilities by building and testing large cryogenic pumps and expanders. Walbridge Construction, of Forest Hills, will build the new facility.</p><p>Along with the 900 Jeannette residents already employed at the Elliott main plant on nearby Fourth Street, the company hopes to create&nbsp;at least 130 locally sourced jobs when the new factory begins operation.</p><p>“Elliott has maintained a strong connection to this area for a very long time,” Elliott CEO&nbsp;Michael Lordi said. “We moved to Jeannette in 1914, and we have remained committed to this&nbsp;area even throughout the problems of the 1970s and 1980s.”</p><p>Despite the steps Jeannette has taken in recent years to revitalize its downtown and surrounding neighborhoods, the&nbsp;city still experiences fallout from the economic downturns of the 1980s.</p><p>Jeannette led among Westmoreland County municipalities in overdose deaths in 2018, according&nbsp;to the Westmoreland County Drug Overdose Task Force. Population levels are still only barely&nbsp;over half of what they were when Jeannette Glass was in operation.</p><p>“This city has suffered a lot,” said longtime resident Bill Rosen. “I know people who lost their jobs when the glass factory closed in the early 1980s and had to leave because there&nbsp;was nothing here. I don’t blame them.”</p><p>Yet Jeannette endures. Upscale restaurants like The Nest, known for its lobster, have remained&nbsp;open for business on Clay Avenue, the city’s main street, for years. And new, hip places, like the soon-to-open Sobel&nbsp;Brewery, will serve Jeannette’s youth population and, hopefully, visitors.</p><p>Mr. Antoniak and the city’s police department have also worked to make Jeannette as safe as&nbsp;possible for its residents. Surveillance cameras now hover above downtown street corners and local&nbsp;police have logged more than 1,000 traffic violations in 2019 alone. Additional cameras will soon be added to Bullitt Avenue, which runs parallel to Clay.</p><p>“The last thing we want to do is scare people or put them on edge, but for this city to improve, I&nbsp;believe that we need to strictly enforce the law,” Mr. Antoniak said. “It’s the easiest way to&nbsp;create a safe and nice community.”</p><p>Likewise, the creation of the Elliott facility is another step toward restoring Jeannette to some of its former glory.</p><p>Via its opening and operation, Mr. Antoniak and Mr. Lordi hope that the factory will help the city&nbsp;regain its lost population and maybe even reduce the number of empty storefronts.</p><p>“This project alone will exceed $60 million. Direct construction jobs, service company support&nbsp;jobs and local material suppliers and establishments will all see trickle-down effects&nbsp;from this project,” Mr. Lordi said.</p><p>Because of this new facility, and despite the setbacks Jeannette has undergone over the years,&nbsp;Mr. Antoniak believes the former “Glass City” is a rising star not only in Westmoreland&nbsp;County, but across the Greater Pittsburgh area.</p><p>“Christmas really did come early for Jeanette this year,” Mr. Antoniak said, “and it gives me a&nbsp;strong reason to hope that our city has a very bright future ahead of it. We’re finally coming&nbsp;back.”</p><p><em>Nick Trombola, freelance writer: suburbanliving@post-gazette.com.</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/local/westmoreland/2020/01/03/New-year-new-hope-for-Jeannette/stories/202001020001</original_url>
