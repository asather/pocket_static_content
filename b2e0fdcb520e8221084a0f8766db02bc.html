<h1>Two Pittsburgh Catholic schools to close, four to merge</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh is closing two grade schools and merging four others because of declines in enrollment and growing debt.</p>
<p>St. Maria Goretti School in Bloomfield and East Catholic School in Forest Hills will both close at the end of the 2019-2020 school year, according to a diocese press release.</p>
<p>Four in the South Hills —&nbsp;St. Anne School in Castle Shannon, St. Bernard in Mt. Lebanon, Our Lady Grace in Scott and St. Thomas More in Bethel Park will in 2020 merge into a single program across two schools: St. Bernard and St. Thomas More.</p>
<p>“As hard as it is to lose a beloved school, these steps will help Catholic education remain affordable, accessible&nbsp;and sustainable for a new generation,” Bishop David Zubik said in a press release.</p>
<p>St. Maria Goretti and East Catholic, both K-8 schools, saw enrollment drop over the past four years. St. Maria Goretti’s enrollment dropped from 172 in 2016-17 to 131 in the 2019-20 school year; the school also reported a debt of $800,000 in the 2018-19 fiscal year, according to a press release. The diocese estimates the school would have continued to accrue $250,000 in debt annually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>East Catholic enrollment fell from 255 to 172 in the past four school years. The school’s debt reached $400,000 in the 2018-19 fiscal year. By the end of this school year, the diocese expects the debt to reach over $600,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are currently nine full-time teachers at St. Maria Goretti and 14 full-time teachers at East Catholic.</p>
<p>Father Kris Stubna, chair of the Pittsburgh-East Region school board, met with faculty, administration and staff at St. Maria Goretti prior to the announcement of the closing. He said the declines in enrollment were known but facing the reality of the closure was painful.</p>
<p>“These teachers are consummate professionals, and despite the sadness at the meetings, they were concerned about the children,” Father Stubna said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The South Region Catholic Elementary Schools currently enroll 790 students, Father David Poecking, president of the schools’ advisory board, said. There are 44 homeroom teachers across the four schools.</p>
<p>“If we were to sustain enrollment, which is unlikely, we’d need approximately 37 teachers,” Father Poecking said. “But in the disruption, we do expect of course to lose some students in the process. An unusually successful merger would probably result in about 34 of those homeroom teachers being retained.”</p>
<p>The diocese has closed several schools over the past few years, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2019/02/23/Catholic-Diocese-of-Pittsburgh-school-closure-consolidation/stories/201902230042" target="_blank">four</a>&nbsp;last year. These recent closures and mergers have been part of an “ongoing regionalization of Catholic schools,” the diocese said in the press release. This includes changing the South Region advisory board into the region’s official school board after this school year, Father Poecking said.</p>
