<p>The 77th Golden Globes will kick off awards season Sunday.&nbsp;Here's what you need to know about Hollywood's golden night, brought to you by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, to honor the best in film and television.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s own Billy Porter is again nominated for his role in “Pose,” FX’s Ryan Murphy-helmed show. Porter <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2019/09/22/Emmy-awards-billy-porter-game-of-thrones-snl-rupaul-this-is-us-cernobyl-when-they-see-us/stories/201909220200" target="_blank">won the award last year</a> for best leading actor in a drama series.</p>
<p>Tom Hanks, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2019/12/09/Billy-Porter-Tom-Hanks-Golden-Globe-nominations-Pittsburgh-Mister-Rogers/stories/201912090082" target="_blank">meanwhile</a>, is nominated for his role as Fred Rogers in the Pittsburgh filmed-and-set “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.” Hanks is also receiving the Cecil B. Demille award at tonight’s ceremony for his acting legacy.</p>
<p>British comedic actor Ricky Gervais <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/entertainment/ricky-gervais-golden-globes/index.html" target="_blank">will be returning to host the show for a fifth time.</a>&nbsp;He took on master of ceremony duties previously from 2010-2012 and in 2016.</p>
<p>Gervais is known for his biting humor and in the past has run afoul of some in Hollywood for his barbs while hosting.&nbsp;That alone should make it worth it to tune in just to see who, if anyone, he skewers.</p>
<p>It's all about the streaming services this year</p>
<p>Netflix led in total nominations, thanks to a strong showing from the films "Marriage Story" and "The Irishman." The dramas were nominated for six and five awards respectively.</p>
<p>In the television categories, the Netflix series "The Crown" and "Unbelievable" got four nominations each, as did HBO's "Chernobyl."</p>
<p>Two major stars won't have to compete to be honored.&nbsp;Alongside Hanks and the Demille award, Ellen DeGeneres will be the recipient of the Carol Burnett Award in recognition of her career.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest names in the industry are set to present at the ceremony. They include Tim Allen, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Cate Blanchett, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tiffany Haddish, Scarlett Johansson, Margot Robbie, Zoe Kravitz, Jason Momoa Elton John and former host Amy Poehler.</p>
<p>Besides checking for Gervais's snark level, there's always the chance a winner will talk about politics in their acceptance speech.&nbsp;Given all that's happening in the world and the fact it is an election year, we are almost betting on it.</p>
<p>Folks will also be waiting to see if Jennifer Lopez snags a statue for her much hailed performance in "Hustlers" and if Joe Pesci will show up even though he's known to shun the spotlight.&nbsp;He's nominated for best supporting actor for his role in "The Irishman."</p>
<p>The event telecast will air Sunday at 8 p.m. EST on NBC.</p>
