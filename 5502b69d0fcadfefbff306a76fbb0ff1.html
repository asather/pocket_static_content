<h1>Standout Micah Parsons has a reason for not being back at Penn State</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’d be easy to think an athlete with the credentials of Micah Parsons would’ve been one of the first men on campus once Penn State allowed football players to return.</p>
<p>But there’s an important reason why the reigning Big Ten linebacker of the year and consensus All-American isn’t back in University Park just yet.</p>
<p>“I wanted to spend this Father’s Day with my son (Malcolm) and father (Terence),” the Harrisburg native reporters Monday via Zoom. “It’s important for me to get that time with my family. It was a mutual thing.”</p>
<p>Parsons told reporters the school tried to get most of the scholarship football players back in the first group of 75 that returned to campus June 8 and started practice on Monday at Holuba Hall.</p>
<p>Penn State hasn’t listed which players are on campus. The school also hasn’t announced any positive tests for COVID-19, though based on recent news at other schools — <a href="https://wvusports.com/news/2020/6/15/one-wvu-football-player-tests-positive-for-covid-19.aspx" target="_blank">West Virginia said Monday</a> a football player tested positive upon returning to campus — it seems possible at least one Nittany Lion could pop up with a positive test. For now, the school is moving forward with its plans for athletes and general students.</p>
<p>The university announced Sunday that it would begin in-person classes again at the start of the fall semester. Aug. 24 is the date that’s been set. Less than two weeks later is Penn State’s scheduled season opener Sept .5 against Kent State at Beaver Stadium.</p>
<p>“Hearing that we’re coming back is a relief,” Parsons said. “It’s a relief because you want to play in front of fans. You want to have that type of environment.</p>
<p>“I hope that things can go back to normal. We’re just taking the next step forward to go back to normal. ... We’re going to keep moving in the right direction, and hopefully, by the time the season comes, Beaver Stadium will be full and packed.”</p>
<p>Football isn’t the only thing on Parsons’ mind when it comes to a return.</p>
<p>“It’s not as fun taking these classes over Zoom meetings online; you want to be interactive,” Parsons said. “It’s harder to get your one-on-ones with the teachers and communicate things that you don’t understand, so hearing that news is a relief.”</p>
<p>While Parsons praised what looms at Penn State, more praise came his way nationally Monday for what the 6-foot-3, 244-pounder can do on the field.</p>
<p>“I’m rolling the dice with Penn State,” former Steeler Bryant McFadden said on CBS Sports HQ when explaining why he’s picking the Nittany Lions to win the Big Ten over Ohio State. “They return an abundance of talent on both sides of the football with the best defensive player in college football in Micah Parsons. He’s a top-three selection waiting to hear his name in the 2021 NFL draft.”</p>
<p>Pro Football Focus named Parsons as its top linebacker in college football for the upcoming season. Several other publications have noted Parsons’ potential too. He finished 2019 with 109 total tackles, 14 tackles for loss, five sacks and four forced fumbles.</p>
<p>“He’s a difference-maker, and I think he will continue to be a difference-maker throughout the season for Penn State,” McFadden said.</p>
