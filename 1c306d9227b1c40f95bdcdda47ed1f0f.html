<h1>Gene Therapy: To dog or not to dog. Tough one.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One sum­mer, when our late and largely un­la­mented Aire­dale went on in­jured re­serve with a torn ACL, peo­ple would stop me on my neigh­bor­hood walks and ask of his where­abouts or for up­dates on his sta­tus.</p>
<p>In­ter­est in Mur­phy was in­tense, so much so that I re­marked upon it to one woman who was walk­ing her dog but stopped to get the scoop.</p>
<p>“I’m amazed by this out­pour­ing of con­cern for him,” I said, not­ing that it didn’t seem to be matched by in­qui­ries as to my own gen­eral pa­thet­i­cism.</p>
<p>“You don’t un­der­stand,” she said ear­nestly. “These pets, they’re like our kids.”</p>
<p>Don’t be ri­dic­u­lous, I thought, I care way more about your pets than I do about your kids.</p>
<p>My walks again have leaned to­ward ev­i­dent pa­thet­i­cism as Murph’s been gone five months this week, and some quick cal­cu­la­tions re­veal that in the past 25 years, we’ve only been dog­less around this house for a to­tal of about 11 months.</p>
<p>Dogless­ness, of course, has its ben­e­fits, and they are not in­sig­nifi­cant. It comes with the in­stant equiv­a­lent of a pay raise, as ac­counts pay­able no lon­ger in­clude the vet, the groomer, the dog food man­u­fac­turer, the dog-board­ing ban­dits, the flea and tick pre­ven­tion ped­dlers, out­lays for var­i­ous treats, toys, leashes, beds, crates, in­ef­fec­tive car­pet solu­tions, and lump sum pay­ments for oc­ca­sions such as when your dog es­capes and at­tacks your neigh­bor’s air-con­di­tion­ing unit ($692, I be­lieve).</p>
<p>Dogless­ness fur­ther brings a de­li­cious re­duc­tion of quo­tid­ian re­spon­si­bil­ity that, frankly, I’m en­joy­ing the hell out of. Even the nat­u­ral sting of sud­den dog­less­ness was mit­i­gated this time by the fact that Murph was a straight-up pain, an im­pul­sive 90-pounder with a wan­der­lust so acute it re­quired that the rear fence even­tu­ally re­sem­ble the street bar­ri­cade rep­re­sented in the more ex­pen­sive pro­duc­tions of “Les Mis­er­a­bles.”</p>
<p>One on­line de­scrip­tion of the Aire­dale breed reads, “In­tel­li­gent, out­go­ing and con­fi­dent, the Aire­dale pos­sesses a won­der­ful play­ful streak that de­lights their hu­mans.”</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But a lot’s changed in re­cent months, maybe you’ve no­ticed, and there’s a no­tion afoot that my wife and I could sure use a dis­trac­tion, some­thing to di­vert at­ten­tion from just hang­ing around watch­ing each other watch the coun­try lurch to­ward an ir­re­vers­ible dys­to­pia.</p>
<p>“When Mur­phy passes,” we used to say, “at least we’ll be able to come and go as we please.”</p>
<p>Well, guess what.</p>
<p>Not only is there no­where to go and noth­ing to see, but also there’s noth­ing afoot that might ame­lio­rate stress (oh, we’ve got stress) the way pets have been proven to. Studies have shown that pet own­ers are less likely to suf­fer from de­pres­sion, high blood pres­sure, hy­per­ten­sion and high cho­les­terol. At the same time, pet own­ers gen­er­ate more se­ro­to­nin and do­pa­mine, the calm­ing chem­i­cals that come into play when you’re stay­ing stuff like, “Who’s a good boy [or girl]?” and “Who’s the pret­ti­est pup?”</p>
<p>Se­ri­ously, you can look this stuff up.</p>
<p>Fur­ther, peo­ple over 65, a de­scrip­tion we hap­pen to match, are 30% less likely to visit a doc­tor if they are pet own­ers. Granted, some por­tion of that 30% is merely pet­ri­fied to leave their dogs home alone for fear the pret­ti­est pup could eas­ily re­model the kitchen or set the house ablaze.</p>
<p>There’s an in­tri­cate bal­ance of pros and cons that in­form the de­ci­sion on whether to re­do­gify, but in weak mo­ments it feels like it’s time to ex­am­ine the is­sue. We’ve tended to break in pups around here in July, and some are no doubt ma­tur­ing to­ward seven or eight weeks as we speak.</p>
<p>Be­cause it might be dog time, I went to Dog­time.com, where I first sorted for la­zi­ness, the most cov­eted at­trib­ute for own­ers who are tied of chas­ing es­cap­ist Aire­dales over hill and over dale. Five breeds looked prom­is­ing as five-star lay­abouts — the bas­set hound, the English bull­dog, the clum­ber span­iel, the grey­hound and the Bern­ese moun­tain dog.</p>
<p>Like me, the bas­set is so lazy it’s des­tined for obe­sity, but I’m not in­ter­ested in a dog that has to be coaxed into a walk. The bull­dog is a five-star drooler, and the clum­ber is a five-star shed­der, both deal break­ers for my wife. The grey­hound is not some­thing you want to be sit­ting next to if the door­bell rings (“And down the stretch they come!”), and the Bern­ese is a five-star shed­der and a four-star drooler.</p>
<p>To me this means an­other look at the safer choice, the Lab­ra­dor, with which we have ex­pe­ri­ence (the dear de­parted Lucy), a hearty breed and a will­ing learner best known for help­ing fish­er­men drag their nets out of the cold North At­lan­tic. We gen­er­ally drag our fish out of the air-con­di­tioned Cran­berry Costco, but I’m sure any Lab would help with that, too, if it was al­lowed.</p>
<p>The other day, my wife showed me a video of some­one los­ing at Jenga to a bor­der col­lie. Prob­lem there is, I don’t re­ally like Jenga.</p>
<p>So on it goes, and yeah, to dog or not to dog, this is a tough one.</p>
