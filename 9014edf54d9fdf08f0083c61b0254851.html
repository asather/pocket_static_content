<h1>Brian O'Neill: A dollar might do two jobs in this pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Spendable dollars have grown scarce during the COVID-19 lockdown, but some are figuring a way to make the same dollar work twice.</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Baratz, a hand surgeon from Upper St. Clair, and his allies are making a small but appreciable dent in a dilemma that begins with two inarguable premises: 1) Your favorite restaurants are closed, some in danger of folding forever. 2) Everyone, everywhere, who’s out of work still needs to eat.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The idea of Double Play — “Everybody is missing baseball,” Dr. Baratz says, “and this will be the only double play this spring” —&nbsp;is to have restaurants put together ready-to-go meals at a low price. DP works with local charities to get them to the people with no or little income.</p>
<p>The man has worked at this in his off hours for less than two weeks but can already say the job of getting food to people is not one he’d want full time. It’s tough. But the need is as obvious as that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/food/2020/03/30/COVID-19-coronavirus-PNC-Foundation-provides-meals-needy-schools/stories/202003300071" target="_blank">long line of cars</a> that crawled toward the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank in Duquesne last Monday, waiting for boxes of food, or Friday’s headline about <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/04/02/first-time-jobless-claims-Pennsylvania-unemployment-coronavirus-COVID-19/stories/202004020184" target="_blank">nearly a million first-time jobless claims</a> in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The fledgling DP has no hopes of scaling that mountain, but what it’s attempting could be replicated anywhere. A handful of restaurants in and around Pittsburgh are putting together ready-to-go meals, helping their workers keep a paycheck and a few score of laid-off workers have one less meal to worry about.</p>
<p>Shelbin Santos, 38, owns Chicken Latino in the Strip District. She moved to Pittsburgh from Peru 21 years ago, following a cousin who was in dental school at the University of Pittsburgh. After stints working the Spanish call center for a couple of banks, she opened her restaurant 13 years ago and started serving some of the most mouth-watering chicken my family has ever eaten.</p>
<p>The Peruvian trick, I’m told, is a stone inside the oven. That way, the bird — marinated and seasoned overnight with cumin, garlic and fresh rosemary — gets indirect heat and stays moist. Ms. Santos is under direct heat now, though, with her restaurant having had to close for two weeks, and her taking out a new line of credit and still having an old lease she no longer has the income to pay.</p>
<p>DP helps a little. Chicken Latino is providing 100 meals for just $500 on weekends, passing them on to&nbsp;<a href="https://casasanjose.org/" target="_blank">Casa San Jose</a>&nbsp;in Beechview, a group Ms. Santos has helped for years.</p>
<p>The Sisters of St. Joseph launched Casa San Jose in Beechview five years ago. Both are named for the head of the Holy Family, who knew something about being a refugee with a newborn baby. Casa San Jose helps undocumented immigrants working in restaurants and hotels, most of whom won’t qualify for Pennsylvania benefits now. They certainly won’t be able to send any money home to relatives in their impoverished countries anymore.</p>
<p><a href="https://412foodrescue.org/" target="_blank">412 Food Rescue</a> is involved with this project, too, doing what it’s been doing since 2015, getting food to people without enough. With restaurants closed, the charity’s singular mission —&nbsp;“preventing perfectly good food from going to waste” — has gotten easier for the wrong reasons. There’s no excess food for restaurants to donate at at the end of the night when there’s no beginning to the night. But Double Play provides a new pipeline from restaurants to charities, and 412 FR is ever ready to be the conveyor.</p>
<p>The 31 Sports Bar &amp;Grille, former Penguin goalie Ken Wregget’s place on Washington Pike in Collier, and Dancing Crab, a Thai restaurant on the South Side, are also involved&nbsp;with this project. Dancing Crab’s owner, Lek Srijariya, had the extraordinarily bad timing of spending $80,000-plus for a liquor license just in time to not be able to sell the first drink. Like so many other restaurateurs, she’s trying to survive on take-out and six-packs to go, but is still donating 50 containers of her chicken noodle soup on top of her $5 meals just because people tell her they like it.</p>
<p>Joe Billhimer, owner of a couple of Wahlburgers franchises, has weathered tough times before. In the gaming business in the summer of 2005, he opened a casino in Biloxi, Miss., two days after Hurricane Katrina hit. But this pandemic is worse because there’s no clear path out of it, Mr. Billhimer said.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>His restaurant in Robinson has closed, but the one in the Block Northway in Ross is participating because his neighbor in Pine, Dr. Bob Goitz, another hand surgeon, told him about Double Play. “It keeps the few folks we have left working and doing stuff,” Mr. Billhimer said. “It’s really a neat idea.”</p>
<p>It is. If you’re able to help 412 Food Rescue or Casa San Jose, go to their websites. Each has a button for COVID-19 response. Checks to Casa San Jose also can be sent to 2116 Broadway Ave., Pittsburgh, Pa. 15216.</p>
<p>If you’d like to put your money someplace else, that’s fine. But for those in good shape, now’s the time to spend locally. It appears we’re all in for a rough spring if not summer. Buying a meal for, or from, a neighbor is likely to be remembered a long time.</p>
