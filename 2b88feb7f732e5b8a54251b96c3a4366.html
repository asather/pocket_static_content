<h1>Kraus aims to replace Harris' reptile ordinance, ban pet alligators</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Not even three months after former city Councilwoman Darlene Harris championed tighter rules on alligator and venomous snake ownership in Pittsburgh, Councilman Bruce Kraus is aiming for&nbsp;a wholesale overhaul of the ordinance to make it “humane.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kraus introduced two bills Tuesday — one, outright banning crocodilian species, including alligators and red-eared slider turtles, but lifting regulations passed in December that tightened restrictions on venomous snake ownership.</p>
<p>"The main opposition to the bill as it was originally put forward was that you could own the alligator or the turtle as long as you kept it trapped in a box, which was the main opposition that [advocacy organization] Humane Action Pittsburgh had with the bill, which I would have to agree. It's an inhumane way to keep an animal,” Mr. Kraus said.</p>
<p>The animal advocacy organization as well as the nonprofit and shelter Humane Animal Rescue worked with the councilman’s office to submit the bills.</p>
<p>The reptile regulations passed by council in December did not specify a&nbsp;“box” for the reptile pets but put forth regulations that&nbsp;“any crocodilian or venomous snake must be housed in a sturdy and secure enclosure” that&nbsp;“shall allow for unrestricted movement of any animals contained within,” among other specifications.</p>
<p>The city and surrounding areas saw a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/10/02/Yet-another-alligator-found-roaming-Pittsburgh-lawrenceville-huimane-animal-rescue-gus-allegheny-river/stories/201910020201" target="_blank">spate of loose alligator cases</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Alligators and red-eared sliders are among the “most frequently abandoned reptiles” in the city, and shelters have become overburdened, according to Natalie Ahwesh, Humane Action Pittsburgh’s vice president.</p>
<p>A representative of Humane Animal Rescue could not be immediately reached.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Kraus nor Ms. Ahwesh could answer why the proposed bill would remove regulations on venomous snake ownership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Medical and educational institutions would be exempt from the ban and current owners would be grandfathered in, given that they obtain liability insurance&nbsp;“in the minimum amount of $1 million,” according to the legislation.</p>
<p>The second piece of legislation introduced by Mr. Kraus would strengthen a 2015 ordinance prohibiting the capture of wild birds.</p>
<p>Mr. Kraus said the impetus for strengthening definitions of wild birds and required permits is that&nbsp;“birds were being trapped in the city and taken to the outskirts, Butler County, places like that, to actually be used in pigeon shoots.”</p>
<p>Council is expected to discuss the bills next Wednesday.</p>
