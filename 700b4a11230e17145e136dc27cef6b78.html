<h1>Impeachment trial: Democrats, White House to make closing arguments</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Senators will hear final arguments from House Democrats and White House defense lawyers on Monday in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both sides will have up to two hours to take the Senate floor to make one last pitch to all 100 senators. The verdict, which will almost certainly acquit Mr. Trump, will be decided at 4 p.m. on Wednesday.</p>
<p>No arguments are expected to change any minds.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Republican-controlled chamber voted 51-49 to block an effort to call witnesses or issue subpoenas for documents in the trial. The Senate rejected calling John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, whose upcoming book reportedly details direct conversations with the president about freezing Ukraine aid to dig up dirt on a political rival.</p>
<p>House Democrats accused Mr. Trump of abusing his power by freezing nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and delaying a White House meeting with its new president to extort the American ally into helping his prospects in this November’s election.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, the Democrats asserted, demanded Ukraine to announce a probe into a Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma, on whose board sat Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden. In December, the House impeached Mr. Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>White House lawyers have argued Mr. Trump did nothing wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In voting to reject witnesses, the Senate effectively ended the trial and put Mr. Trump on the path to acquittal. At least 67 votes are required to remove a president from office.</p>
<p>Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska — one of the key moderate Republicans considered a swing vote on witnesses — said she opposed new information&nbsp;because nothing any witness or new document would bring to the trial could change anybody's mind.</p>
<p>“Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,” Ms. Murkowski wrote. “I don’t believe the continuation of this process will change anything.”</p>
<p>After the four-hour session Monday, the Senate will adjourn the trial until 4 p.m. on Wednesday, when senators will weigh final votes on two House-passed articles of impeachment.&nbsp;</p>
