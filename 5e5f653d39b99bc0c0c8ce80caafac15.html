<h1>Union workers — ‘afraid of retribution’ — reluctant to protest at Beaver County nursing home</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Employees at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center were scheduled to take part in a nationwide protest Thursday to encourage the federal government to provide more personal protective equipment for healthcare workers.</p>
<p>The union that organized the “largest one-day protest of healthcare workers battling COVID-19” — the Service Employees International Union, known as SEIU — sent out press releases Wednesday encouraging reporters to head out to Brighton Rehabilitation and eight other places in Southwest Pennsylvania where union members would be demonstrating.</p>
<p>But the demonstration at Brighton Rehabilitation — which is dealing with at least 50 positive COVID-19 cases and at least 11 deaths among residents, and at least 10 positive cases among staff — lasted less than a minute Thursday. About 10 employees exited the building together, but only three unnamed staffers posed for a photo in the parking lot by their local union co-president, Shelby Dille, before they left quickly, too.</p>
<p>“I hate to tell you, but a lot of people [at Brighton Rehabilitation] are afraid of retribution,” said Ms. Dille, who was the only one who stayed to answer questions from a reporter, even though the protest was not against their home’s owners, but the federal government.</p>

<p>Some of the reluctance to stay and talk to the reporters, she said, is due to a growing sense among Brighton’s staff that the nursing home is being portrayed badly by the media.</p>
<p>That, she said, is not only because some stories have quoted people saying the nursing home is dirty and the staff overwhelmed — which employees feel has made it seem like they are to blame for the outbreak — but because of a confusing message put out by the building’s owners Tuesday.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/06/Brighton-Rehab-and-Wellness-Beaver-PA-nursing-home-coronavirus-positive-cases/stories/202004060124" target="_blank">the owners’ press release Monday</a>, they declared that they were now “presuming” that everyone in the home who lives and works there was positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Upon consultation with the Department of Health, and consistent with practices of facilities on the cutting edge of prevention and treatment, we are beginning to shift away from counting test results, and presuming all staff and residents may be positive,” a press release from Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center said in part. “Thinking about the virus in this way allows us to be more protective of asymptomatic staff and residents.”</p>
<p>Even though the press release was quoted verbatim in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and numerous other news outlets that day, Ms. Dille said employees felt that “the way [the owners] wanted it to come out has been misconstrued and taken out of context.</p>
<p>“It made it sound like everyone in the building has” COVID-19, she said. “That’s not true.”</p>
<p>The owners — who have never answered questions directly, despite numerous requests —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/04/08/Beaver-County-nursing-home-owners-union-reach-agreement-COVID-19-Brighton/stories/202004080104" target="_blank">put out another press release Tuesday</a> trying to clarify the Monday press release, conceding that Monday’s press release created a “misunderstanding that we desire to clarify.”</p>
<p>Ms. Dille said the confusion over the press release made it seem like the situation at Brighton was worse that it was, and it overshadowed what she thought was a much more important event this past week.</p>
<p>“I’m very happy about the agreement we reached Tuesday,” she said of the union and management’s agreement to provide more protective equipment and have daily meetings with union leadership and management to try to problem solve.</p>
<p>“I think the agreement will help keep everyone safer, especially our residents,” she said.</p>
<p>There have already been two such meetings this week and she felt they have been effective.</p>
<p>“We come to an understanding of what we need and what the building [managers] can help us with,” she said. “Of course, not everything can be done right at this minute, but we are getting things done more quickly now.”</p>
<p>She also downplayed the reports of large walkouts by employees because of the problems over the COVID-19 outbreak, and that it added to any unusual staffing shortage. At least some of the staff who left were not full-time union employees, but temporary hires through agencies and even transfers from other nursing homes owned by Comprehensive Healthcare, the owners of Brighton.</p>
<p>“I don’t know that [staffing] was a problem,” she said. “It’s the same in all nursing homes. Every nursing home has a staffing shortage.”</p>
<p>The same holds true during the COVID-19 outbreak, she said.</p>
<p>While the 50 resident cases and 11 deaths is currently the worst outbreak of COVID-19 in a nursing home in Pennsylvania, Ms. Dille noted that news reports showed outbreaks occurring in other homes in the region.</p>
<p>“The other [outbreaks at nursing homes] just started, so we’ll hold off on” whether Brighton’s is the worst, she said. “You don’t know what’s going to happen at St. Barnabas” nursing home.</p>
<p>St. Barnabas nursing homes on Wednesday reported a large increase in cases — now at 18 — with two deaths so far.</p>
<p>Ms. Dille, who has been a certified nurse’s assistant working at Brighton for 14 years and for 40 years total in nursing homes, said the COVID-19 outbreak has the entire staff working extra hard to care for the residents, including donning the hot, cumbersome gowns, gloves and facemasks to work every day in the affected units.</p>
<p>“We do have extra work,” she said. “But if it saves our lives, our co-workers’ lives, our families, and most importantly the residents’ lives, it’s worth it.”</p>
