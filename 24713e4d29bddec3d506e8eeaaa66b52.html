<p>Another of Pittsburgh’s joys of summer has been lost to the COVID-19 pandemic: Pittsburgh CLO officially said goodbye to its 2020 season on Friday, and said hello to 2021 by announcing the lineup for its 75th year.</p>
<p>The company that has been a musical rite of summer for seven decades also has been a steppingstone to Broadway for aspiring musical theater artists, as well as a frequent stop for Broadway’s marquee names since 1946.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Although expected, it’s now official. Each season employs hundreds of people, from stagehands to the CLO Orchestra, and the company has been the main summer tenant at the Benedum Center, starting in 1988.</p>
<p>Once the board of directors agreed to end the season, Van Kaplan, CLO’s executive producer and CEO, spent Friday informing stakeholders, including subscribers.</p>
<p>“This was a difficult and heartbreaking decision. I can’t even imagine the summer without CLO,” Mr. Kaplan said Saturday afternoon. “Every arts organization in town is suffering now, and for us, 75 percent of our revenue comes from our summer season.”</p>
<p>There are no layoffs or furloughs planned for the company’s office staff, he said, adding that CLO Academy’s quick move to online classes has kept the education arm of the company bustling.</p>
<p>It also may have eased the blow for audiences to have a new season to look forward to, and it helped that planning for next year’s anniversary season was far enough along to make the announcement.</p>
<p>From 2020, “Sister Act” and “A Chorus Line’ move forward to 2021. The tours of “The SpongeBob Musical” and “Once on This Island” previously announced that they had halted in their tracks, and other shows lost to the coronavirus outbreak are CLO productions of “Cabaret,” “Guys and Dolls” and “A Chorus Line.”</p>
<p>The 2021 summer season, should all return to something close to normal, begins with the tour of “Jersey Boys” (June 1-5) and then moves into the CLO’s first production of “Kinky Boots” (June 15-20), the Tony-winning show that starred Billy Porter on Broadway.</p>
<p>The season continues with “A Chorus Line” (June 22-27); “The Drowsy Chaperone” (July 6-11), “Sister Act” (July 20-25) and “Godspell” (Aug. 3-8)’ a Stephen Schwartz show that was developed at Carnegie Mellon 50 years ago.</p>
<p>The first time audiences see the CLO in action again may be in the fall. “UNTITLED: A New Musical Comedy About Serious Drama,” which was developed by CLO, was supposed to open April 3, but has been postponed until Oct. 29-Nov. 29.</p>
<p>The company already has begun a “Raise the Curtain” capital campaign and, like many nonprofit theaters, Pittsburgh CLO is hoping ticket-holders who can afford it will donate the price of this year’s tickets and re-up for next year.&nbsp;However, current season ticket-holders will be able to transfer tickets to 2021.</p>
<p>CLO previously was forced to cancel the 2020 Gene Kelly Awards, a musical theater program that has helped distribute thousands of dollars in scholarships to participating high schools in Allegheny County.</p>
<p>Besides the academy classes, the company has been staying connected with audiences through weekly online “CLOse Up” shows: “SPARK the Conversation,” at 3 p.m. Tuesdays,, hosted by Olivia O’Connor, the CLO’s manager of new works, and, at 5 p.m. Thursdays, “Conversations &amp; Cocktails” with the CLO’s Mark Fleischer, whose guests have included Clay Aiken and Richard Thomas.</p>
<p>In an open letter to subscribers on the CLO website, Mr. Kaplan explained that, “At 74 years old, we have had our share of challenges, but never have we faced an existential threat like this health crisis, which hits us where we live.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, he added,&nbsp;“The best thing people can do now is stick with us.”</p>
