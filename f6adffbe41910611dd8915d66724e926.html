<h1>Steelers WR Diontae Johnson has sports hernia surgery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Wide receiver Diontae Johnson, a third-round draft choice who led all NFL rookies with 59 catches in 2019, posted a picture of himself, lying in a hospital bed, on his Instagram account the other day. But he didn’t indicate why he was there.</p>
<p>The reason? Johnson had sports hernia surgery.</p>
<p>It is not known how long Johnson will be sidelined, but several medical websites indicate the normal recovery time when having that type of surgery is 4-6 weeks.</p>
<p>It has been a tough year for some of the Steelers top offensive players. In addition to the elbow surgery that ended Ben Roethlisberger’s 2019 season after two games, backup quarterback Mason Rudolph sustained a potentially dangerous posterior sternoclavicular dislocation in Week 16 that required immediate surgery. His recovery time was 6-8 weeks.</p>
<p>Also, running back James Conner and wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster missed a combined 10 games and parts of others with various injuries late in the season.</p>
<p>When Johnson posted the photo of himself in a hospital bed, he merely wrote, “Ima Bounce Back.”</p>
<p><strong>Combine prep</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers will begin meeting and discussing what to do in free agency next week before heading to the NFL combine in Indianapolis on Feb. 23.</p>
<p>At the top of the list will be determining what to do with outside linebacker Bud Dupree, who is an unrestricted free agent and is expected to receive a franchise tag. Both coach Mike Tomlin and team president Art Rooney II have referred to Dupree as a “top priority” in the offseason.</p>
<p>The period for teams to assign franchise tags begins Feb. 25 and extends until March 10. If they elect to use a franchise tag, teams have until July 15 to sign that player to a long-term contract.</p>
<p>“We have a good idea about where things stand at this point, but we don’t have that concrete information as to whether or not we will tag,” Colbert said. “We always say if a tag is available, it’s something we will always consider. But we’re nowhere near with our final free agency preparation leading into the draft.”</p>
<p><strong>’I have to do a better job’</strong></p>
<p>Colbert, who turned 63 last month, signed another one-year extension with the Steelers last week that will keep him with the team through the 2021 draft.</p>
<p>But just because he is signing one-year deals does not mean Colbert is thinking of going anywhere else. Earlier this season, there was a report that Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper, a former Steelers investor, would like to hire Colbert as his general manager.</p>
<p>Colbert said he and team president Art Rooney II have agreed on the one-year contracts because “that’s where I am in my career.” But perhaps fueling his desire to remain with the team is that the Steelers have missed the playoffs each of the past two years.</p>
<p>“I’m not comfortable with that,” Colbert said. “I have to do a better job. But that’s a personal thing, a personal preference.</p>
<p>“I can say this without any hesitation— as long as the Rooneys and the Pittsburgh Steelers want me to be a part of this organization, and it’s a good thing for our family, we’ll be here. I’m not looking to go anywhere else ever again as long as the Rooneys and the Steelers are interested in me.”</p>
