<h1>Ben Roethlisberger is throwing passes to Steelers teammates again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers quarterback <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2020/03/20/ben-roethlisberger-update-steelers-offseason-2020-ramon-foster/stories/202003220038" target="_blank">Ben Roethlisberger promised</a> he would not get his hair cut or shave his beard until he started throwing&nbsp;“NFL-caliber” passes to his teammates. On Monday afternoon, Roethlisberger let the world know his Grizzly Adams look is no more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roethlisberger posted a short video on his Twitter account that showed him zipping some passes to Steelers receivers Ryan Switzer and JuJu Smith-Schuster and running back James Conner at Quaker Valley Stadium in Leetsdale.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger is later seen in a barber’s chair getting his hair cut and his beard shaved.&nbsp;The video ends with Smith-Schuster saying: “He’s back.”</p>
<p>Roethlisberger had season-ending elbow surgery in September after exiting a game against the Seahawks at Heinz Field with elbow pain. The Steelers&nbsp;are conducting virtual offseason sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic with players at their homes, but Roethlisberger’s video is the first time he been documented throwing the ball with some zip to teammates. He had previously tweeted out a video of himself doing some soft toss in a gymnasium.</p>
<p>The Steelers are opening their facility on the South Side Tuesday, but players and coaches are not allowed in the building. That won’t happen until all 32 NFL teams can begin their offseason programs at the same time, as different locations have different processes for reopening. Until then, expect to see Roethlisberger throwing to his teammates until they are permitted to do it at their facility.</p>
