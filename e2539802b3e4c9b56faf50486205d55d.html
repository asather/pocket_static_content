<h1>More details emerge on Pa.'s coronavirus cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A day after Pennsylvania state officials confirmed two cases of COVID-19, more information has emerged.</p>
<p>During a press conference on Friday, Pennsylvania’s secretary of health Rachel Levine said two adults in Delaware and Wayne counties were quarantined in their homes and in “good physical condition” after testing positive for the virus.</p>
<p>She said both patients had recently traveled, one out of state and one overseas. But due to confidentiality, no other information about those patients was made available at the press conference with Gov. Tom Wolf and Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency officials.</p>
<p>Now some more information about those two cases has been made public.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Inquirer reports state Rep. Greg Vitali (D-Delaware) said following a call with county officials, he learned the Delaware County patient is a woman who recently returned from Boston. A handful of cases are linked to a recent conference in that city.</p>
<p>The Inquirer reported that Mr. Vitali’s report was confirmed by another person on the call.</p>
<p>Mr. Vitali said emergency services officials told him the woman was treated at Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland, and her physician was also under quarantine.</p>
<p>As for the Wayne County patient, the Citizens Voice reports Wayne Memorial Hospital officials said the man sought treatment March 4 at the hospital’s Carbondale Family Health Center, and that’s where his symptoms were recognized.</p>
<p>Officials said the man had recently returned to the United States after traveling extensively in Europe, including one of the countries where COVID-19 is present.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a Bucks County school district that closed five schools Friday&nbsp;“out of an abundance of caution” due to possible exposure to coronavirus, students and staff have tested negative, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central Bucks School District’s superintendent John Kopicki ordered five schools closed as a precaution against the spread of COVID-19. Butler Elementary, Central Bucks South, Titus Elementary, Tohickon Middle School and Tamanend Middle School were not in session.</p>
<p>The closure came after health officials discovered a person from Maryland tested positive for the virus and had attended a recent gathering at a residence in Bucks County, according to the Inquirer. Several district students and staff had attended the same gathering.</p>
<p>On Friday evening, the Inquirer reported officials said students and staff had tested negative for coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Very few” had any possible symptoms,” county spokesman Larry King told the news outlet, adding the virus’ 14-day incubation period will be over by Monday.</p>
<p>The Inquirer reported the schools will be closed throughout the weekend for deep cleaning and to disinfect school buses.</p>
<p>“We need to remain vigilant during the rest of the weekend. If all goes well, I would hope we can re-open schools on Monday.” David Damsker, director of the Bucks County Department of Health, told Fox 29 in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>On Friday, Mr. Wolf signed an emergency disaster declaration to provide increased support to state agencies responding to the virus.</p>
<p>“It is critical to prepare for and respond to suspected or confirmed cases in the commonwealth and to implement measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Mr. Wolf said in a news release. “The disaster declaration is an additional way we can be prepared, so I authorized the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency Director or his designee, to assume command and control of all statewide emergency operations and authorize and direct that all commonwealth departments and agencies use all available resources and personnel as is deemed necessary to cope with this emergency situation.”</p>
<p>State officials are urging everyone to take precautions – from washing hands frequently to disinfecting surfaces – to slow the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
