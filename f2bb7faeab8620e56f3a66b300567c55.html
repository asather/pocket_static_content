<h1>Pittsburgh native and 'Last Dance' producer Jake Rogal talks MJ, his documentary and his love of the Steel City</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jake Rogal needed to make sure it was all right with his higher-ups before he agreed to do an interview. So the Pittsburgh native and producer of&nbsp;“The Last Dance,” the upcoming ESPN documentary series on Michael Jordan that debuts on Sunday, checked in with the director of the documentary, Jason Hehir, and got the go-ahead.</p>
<p>Hehir had a request, though. He wanted to be interviewed, too, to emphasize Rogal’s importance to the documentary.</p>
<p>“His passion for this, his knowledge of this, his dedication to this is the reason why, if people enjoy this project, it’s because of the hard work he put in for two years,” Hehir said.&nbsp;“...&nbsp;He was doing three important jobs in one. We should have had three producers doing the one job that he did.”</p>
<p>Rogal’s roots are in Pittsburgh, and they’re sturdy. His grandfather was Bill “Chilly Bill” Cardille, who hosted&nbsp;“Chiller Theater,”&nbsp;the popular Saturday late-night program that showcased horror and science fiction films on Pittsburgh’s NBC affiliate from 1963 to 1984. Rogal’s mother, Lori Cardille, was in&nbsp;“Day of the Dead,” and his father is a television writer.</p>
<p>It makes sense, then, that growing up attending Shadyside Academy, Rogal was drawn to television. From there, he went to college at Delaware, got an internship with HBO and worked hard to make an impression on people.</p>
<p>He eventually met Hehir through some mutual friends, hit it off and got hired to be a producer for Hehir’s&nbsp;“Andre the Giant” documentary for HBO. There, Rogal impressed Hehir with that three-jobs-in-one type of work ethic, which landed him a spot on&nbsp;“The Last Dance,” and that’s what Rogal has been working on for the last two-and-a-half years.</p>
<p>After coordinating 108 interviews with 106 people, helping edit the entire docuseries and pitching in on creative decisions, Rogal’s side of production is set to more or less wrap up on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On top of all of that, Rogal is as proud a Pittsburgher as there is. Hehir says Rogal always brings his Terrible Towel with him to watch Steelers games, even out to sports bars. Their relationship has even softened Hehir, a Massachusetts native and New England Patriots fan, who has been affected by Rogal to the point that he’ll root for what many consider to be a rival team just to see his friend benefit.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen someone more proud of being where they’re from than Jake is proud of being from Pittsburgh,” Hehir said.&nbsp;“... I’m a Patriots fan first, but I’m a Steeler fan second, just because I care so much about seeing him happy.”</p>
<p>We caught up with Rogal to get his thoughts on the production and release of&nbsp;“The Last Dance,” what drives his love of Pittsburgh and more:</p>
<p><em>(This interview has been edited and condensed for</em> <em>clarity</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Post-Gazette:&nbsp;</strong>How are you dealing with this specific time, where [“The Last Dance” is] about to come out?</p>
<p><strong>Jake Rogal:&nbsp;</strong>It’s very nerve-racking. You’re trying to finish the series while anticipating the release of it. So you’re about to have millions of people watch this thing, and you’re trying not to think about that, because you really have to stick the landing and finish. So it’s more nerve-racking now because your brain inevitably goes to Sunday night’s premier, and you think, all right, this is airing after working on it for so long, and I hope it’s good, and I hope people like it, and we put so much into it. But then, immediately you have to snap back and think, we’re not done yet. We have to finish this series. And arguably, the end of the series, that’s what sticks with people.</p>
<p><strong>P-G:&nbsp;</strong>What are some things that people wouldn’t think of in terms of getting this together that make it difficult?</p>
<p><strong>JR:&nbsp;</strong>Right away, you have an advantage because you have Michael Jordan and his team, so just getting people to agree is normally a really hard part. Like, what’s in it for me, and why should I be a part of this? But as soon as you say it’s for a Michael Jordan documentary and Michael Jordan is involved, you get the, “OK, I’ll do it,” part of it out right away. So once you convince people like that this is legit, then people want to be associated with Michael. ...&nbsp;What’s hard is that people have lives, and they’ll say, “Yeah, I can do it in two months,” but you have to deliver an episode earlier than two months, and you need that person. So the hardest part is getting all that timing to work because everyone’s agreeable, but the schedules don’t always align.</p>
<p><strong>P-G:&nbsp;</strong>[Hehir] said you pretty much do the job of three people. What does that look like from your perspective?</p>
<p><strong>JR:&nbsp;</strong>The way I look at it is my one job is to try and support Jason and his vision for the show, and there’s a lot of little jobs that come with that, so he probably looks at it as multiple jobs. But the main job is just making sure that we’re doing what Jason wants and this thing becomes what he wants it to be. And in order to do that, it’s to be there for him to bounce ideas off of me, it’s to book interviews, it’s to help log footage or find shots or whatever I can do to chip away at the ultimate goal of making this thing good and making it what Jason wants it to be.</p>
<p><strong>P-G:&nbsp;</strong>Jason said he doesn’t know anybody who’s prouder of their city.</p>
<p><strong>JR:&nbsp;</strong>Pittsburgh is everything to me. I care about Pittsburgh as much as I care about anything in my life. I wish Pittsburgh had the work opportunity for me there because I would be there in a second. I have all intentions of trying to get back there however I can if I can get my family to want to move back there.</p>
<p>The Steelers, the Penguins and the Pirates dictate my life. Me and Jason would plan flights and interviews around games because he wanted to watch the Patriots and I wanted to watch the Steelers. I won’t miss a game. I don’t care what it is, I will not miss a game. I make sure that when I meet people, they know I’m from Pittsburgh. I keep my 412 number because I don’t ever want to lose that in case when people see me calling, they recognize it. I do crazy things to let people know I’m from Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>P-G:&nbsp;</strong>In your own words, what is it about Pittsburgh [that you love so much]?</p>
<p><strong>JR:&nbsp;</strong>The way I look at it is if the world was like Pittsburgh, the world would be a better place. And I mean that because people are respectful, and they’re kind and they’re honest, and they truly care about the community, and you feel like you’re part of a tribe when you’re from Pittsburgh. Immediately when I meet someone from Pittsburgh, no matter what they say or do, I am on their side. There’s a connection there.</p>
<p>I got my job at HBO, one of the reasons was because I was an intern there, and I hung up a Steelers photo in my cubicle, and there was a woman there who worked at HBO, and she came by, and she said, “Hey, I’m from Pittsburgh.” And I said, “Hey, me too.” And it turns out that we both went to Shadyside, and we hit it off, and I stayed in touch with her, and I got into HBO through that.</p>
<p><strong>P-G:&nbsp;</strong>Was there anything that you took away that was an especially cool moment with an interviewee? Were you starstruck by any?</p>
<p><strong>JR:&nbsp;</strong>First of all, I will always be starstruck. I’ll never let people know that I am, but if I see a Pittsburgh athlete I love, I get starstruck. It’s so cool. It’s my favorite thing. If I saw Minkah Fitzpatrick walking down the street, I would go nuts. I wouldn’t go up and approach him, but in my heart and my head, I would go nuts. So I get starstruck by every single person I see. I just don’t put off. I try to act cool.</p>
<p>I think Steve Kerr was amazing. I was looking forward to that, and he always pops into my head as really nice, really thoughtful. You can see why he would be a good teammate and a good coach. He’s someone you want to be around.</p>
<p>Michael was the best interview, and it sounds like, of course you say that, but he really was. That was such a huge thing for us, because you never know, and he’s the main character of the whole thing. He was just unbelievable. He was great with his time. He was incredibly honest and open and willing to answer the questions as best as he could. And seeing him, it was impossible to not be starstruck. I remember he walked in, and you see all the highlights and you see all the things, and he doesn’t feel like he’s a real person when you see all that stuff. Then he walks in the door, and you’re like, “Oh my God, he actually does exist.” I remember having that thought. I remember looking at his hands, and I was like, “God, those hands. He hit the shot against Georgetown. He hit the shot against Utah. He’s held six NBA titles. All this stuff. Those are the hands that did that. That’s so crazy.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then Barack Obama, I could barely talk. I was so starstruck by him. Again, seeing him, you forget he’s a real person, and then he walks in and you’re like, “Wow, he’s walking and he’s moving and he’s real.”</p>
<p><strong>P-G:&nbsp;</strong>And with Jordan specifically, I have to imagine it’s cool, since he’s typically such a reserved guy.</p>
<p><strong>JR:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, and that’s why you feel so grateful. There’s maybe 10 people in the room, and you’re one of them. Like, how was I lucky enough to get in that room? This thing would not have worked if he wasn’t really willing to participate because it needs to feel genuine and it needs to feel real, and he was willing to let that happen. And I think that’s just so important to the whole process. There was never a sense that he was reserved or holding back during the interviews. Every question, he answered, and Jason asked him really hard questions and I think Jason went where he needed to go, and Michael was very willing to answer those.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>P-G:&nbsp;</strong>How did he come to agree to do it?</p>
<p><strong>JR:&nbsp;</strong>The documentary landscape has changed so dramatically recently, so long-form documentaries are becoming a lot more popular. This dynasty and the story of Michael is so huge, it needs that emerging format to really show the story. So the piece was in place. And then at the time, Golden State was on their 73-win run, and LeBron was on his championship run, and I think a lot of that talk kind of got him like, “OK, maybe I should do this doc, and maybe I should be a part of this.”</p>
<p>He has two young daughters, I know, and I’m sure it’ll be cool for him to show them one day, “Hey, this is what I was about.” So I think it was the combination of his team having the idea to pitch the documentary, the documentary landscape changing in order to bring in a 10-hour documentary, a little bit of competitiveness in him with Golden State and LeBron, like, “What about me?” — not, “What about me,” but like, “I’m still Michael Jordan” — and also probably having it as a time-piece, hopefully, for his young daughters to see.</p>
