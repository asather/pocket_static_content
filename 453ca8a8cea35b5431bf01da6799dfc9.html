<p>&nbsp;<strong>“The Good Lord Bird”</strong> — Ethan Hawke shines in this rollicking, seven-part limited series based on James McBride’s 2013 National Book Award winner. Hawke plays legendary abolitionist John Brown in a story told, with humor and imagination, from the point of view of a fictional, cross-dressing slave boy nicknamed “Onion” (Joshua Caleb Johnson). The kid becomes a member of Brown’s motley group of freedom fighters and eventually finds himself participating in the failed 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry, one of the catalysts for the Civil War. The cast also includes Daveed Diggs as Frederick Douglass. (9 p.m. Sunday, Showtime).</p>
