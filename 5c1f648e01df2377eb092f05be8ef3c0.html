<h1>Tour de France won't start as scheduled due to COVID-19 restrictions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Tour de France won’t begin as originally planned because French President Emmanuel Macron has canceled all public events with large crowds through mid-July in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Tour organizers say it is now impossible for the three-week race to start on June 27 in the Riviera city of Nice as scheduled.</p>
<p>It is unclear if cycling’s biggest event will be scrapped from the race calendar.</p>
<p>New plans are likely to be announced before the end of the month following consultations with the governing body of cycling.</p>
