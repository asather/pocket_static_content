<p>A $35,000 grant will help move Pittsburgh a little closer to Erie.</p>
<p>It will do that for bikers, hikers and others on the Armstrong Trail, a 36-mile stretch of the former Allegheny Valley Railroad line along the eastern bank of the Allegheny River in Armstrong and Clarion counties north of Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trail is part of a network that people eventually will be able to pedal and walk between the Ohio River and Lake Erie. But one of the gaps on it is the&nbsp;2,468-feet-long Brady Tunnel, a train shortcut that opened in 1916 but has been closed because it’s in dangerous disrepair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But groups are working to change that. One of them, Armstrong Trails, has been awarded a $35,000 grant for the project from the national Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. The local trail is one of six in the country to receive a 2020 Doppelt Family Trail Development Fund grant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It helps tremendously,” says Chris Ziegler, executive director of Armstrong Trails. That’s the new name, as of this year, for what had been the Allegheny Valley Land Trust and its partner,&nbsp;the Armstrong Rails to Trails Association.</p>
<p>This past fall, the nonprofit launched the first phase of construction and design on the tunnel, which was completed by the end of 2019 and funded by a $829,400 grant from the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and matching funds. That $1.3-million phase included some steel liner and repairs to a sluice at the northern end that carries water over the tunnel.</p>
<p>Part of a second phase (being funded with $500,000 from DCNR and matching funds), this new grant will be used to rebuild a sluice at the tunnel’s south end to divert water over the tunnel and into the Allegheny River. That will prevent damage to the stonework from water and ice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Now we don’t have worry about that,” says Ms. Ziegler, who hopes the work will be done by this summer.</p>
<p>She can’t yet say when the tunnel will open, but it could be as early as the end of next year, depending on what other funding she’s able to get. The total cost is expected to be around $6 million.</p>
<p>“We’re making some good progress,” she said, including launching a new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/armstrongtrails/" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> that is engaging a lot of people. The Armstrong Trail is to be not only part of the 270-mile Erie to Pittsburgh Trail but also part of the 230-mile PA Wilds Loop and the 1,500-plus-mile Industrial Heartlands Trail as trails continue to grow and connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this trail network is not just for people wearing spandex, she stresses. “It’s for railroaders, it’s for people who like history, it’s for photographers.” The tunnel, which she agrees has a big cool factor,&nbsp;“is an opportunity to open it up to so much more.”&nbsp;</p>
