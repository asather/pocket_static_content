<h1>Officer grazes man with bullet after incident near Sto-Rox High School</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gunfire near Sto-Rox High School on Monday afternoon led to a foot chase in which a police officer grazed a man with a bullet.</p>
<p>According to a release from Allegheny County police, the incident occurred about 2 p.m. when Stowe and McKees Rocks police officers heard the sound of gunfire in the&nbsp;1100 block of Dohrman Street — around two blocks from the school — and went to investigate.</p>
<p>Police said responding officers discovered that a black car leaving the area may have been involved in the shooting, and that Stowe police had stopped a vehicle matching that description about three blocks away on Ann Alley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The driver of the car on Ann Alley ran from the scene, prompting police to give chase.&nbsp;That man — who police have not named — began running through&nbsp;yards of homes and jumping fences, police said.</p>
<p>At one point, according to police, the man ran at a Stowe officer, leading the officer to fire his gun at the man, who was grazed by the bullet.</p>
<p>The suspect was taken into custody and then treated and released from a hospital. Police said the man was wanted on outstanding warrants and will be placed in the Allegheny County Jail.</p>
<p>Police said the have not received any reports of people who were injured in the initial shooting by the school.</p>
<p>Police, though, identified another vehicle involved in the shooting as a black Chevrolet Spark&nbsp;with Missouri plate VD9-L6S. The vehicle&nbsp;has bullet damage to the front windshield and will likely be missing the driver side window. Anyone who sees the vehicle should call 911 immediately.</p>
<p>Anyone with information regarding the incident should&nbsp;call the Allegheny County Police Tip Line at 1-833-ALL-TIPS.&nbsp;The department can also be reached through social media and its website.</p>
