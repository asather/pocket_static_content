<h1>Mel Gibson hospitalized, has recovered from coronavirus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Actor and director Mel Gibson was hospitalized in April after testing positive for the coronavirus but has since recovered, his representative said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gibson, 64, spent a week in a California hospital, the representative said. He was treated with remdesivir, the first drug shown to be effective against the virus, and has since tested negative several times, the representative said.</p>
<p>The actor joined a lengthy list of celebrities, politicians, sports stars and other well-known figures, including actors Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, to reveal their struggles with the virus, which has infected more than four million Americans.</p>
<p>Perhaps best known for his 1996 film “Braveheart,” for which he won a pair of Academy Awards, Gibson fell out of favor in Hollywood in the early 2000s for anti-Semitic and misogynist rants. In 2006, he apologized for what he described as “despicable” remarks he had made when he was arrested on a drunken-driving charge.</p>
<p>He has pulled off something of a comeback in Hollywood after expressing repentance for his past behavior. In 2017, he landed six Oscar nominations, including for best director, for “Hacksaw Ridge,” a World War II feature he directed. He said in 2016 that he had been sober for 10 years.</p>
<p>In June, Winona Ryder told The Sunday Times of London that Gibson had made bigoted remarks to her at a party more than a decade ago. Mr. Gibson’s representative denied that he had made the comments.</p>
