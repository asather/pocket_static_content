<h1>No fooling, bars and restaurants are trying mocktails</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Some bars and restaurants are dealing with Allegheny County’s ban on on-premise alcohol by making a mockery of it.&nbsp;Since they can’t serve cocktails, they’re serving alcohol-free mocktails.</p>
<p>Customers are rolling with it, but restaurateurs seem to agree that mocktails aren’t, well, strong enough to help their bottom lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Lincoln Avenue Brewery on Bellevue’s main drag, co-owner Grant Saylor heard about the ban on Sunday and decided to continue serving food and shift back to selling beer and other alcoholic drinks to go only. To give dine-in customers something special to sip, lead bartender Miya Gossett created three alcohol-free “fruit infusions” with the hashtags #mocktails and #quarantinelife on Facebook.</p>
<p>Ms. Gossett says she’d already been thinking about adding some non-alcoholic options. “OK, well, it’s time to get on that immediately,” she said to herself.</p>
<p>She whipped up a Cherry Limeade, Sparkling Lemonade and Blueberry Mojito, striking a red, white and blue theme for the Fourth of July weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Business on Tuesday, the first day the alcohol ban was to be enforced, was completely dead, Mr. Saylor reported. But for Wednesday, the always busy Burger Night, he had cups with lids ready so customers could also take mocktails to go and add their own, uh,&nbsp;“flavorings” at home. At least one couple did that with two of the 22 mocktails sold. Time will tell but, he says with his typical positivity, “I think they’ll do well.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the customers who enjoyed one in house was Avalon’s Noreen Marusic, who says the Cherry Limeade was “refreshing and beautiful, a&nbsp;great alternative to just a soda, iced tea or water for sure!” But she added, to not have a beer at the brewery was&nbsp;“very sad.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the ban lifts, Ms. Gossett plans to keep some mocktails on the menu for pregnant women and others who can’t or prefer to not have alcohol. The bartender says, “I’ll absolutely continue to play around.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alcoholic drinks are a huge draw and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/dining/2020/06/30/restaurants-alcohol-sales-profit-Allegheny-County-COVID-19/stories/202006300050" target="_blank">often the biggest profit maker</a>&nbsp;at bars and restaurants.&nbsp;But the hospitality industry is having to adapt to developments related to COVID-19, so they are doing so however they can, including selling alcoholic drinks to go. Adding mocktails is one more thing to try. It’s all they can do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Challenging times call for extra creativity on our part!” is how South Side’s Carmella’s Plates &amp; Pints announced its five new mocktails — including a Cherry Cocktail and a MockMosa -—for dine-in customers on Wednesday. But business still was “really, really, really, really, really slow,” says owner Carmella Salem.</p>
<p>It made no sense to tell one would-be dine-in customer that he couldn’t have a glass of wine with his meatloaf, which he decided to take home instead. She believes that many people are confused by what they can and cannot do, and many are wary because of the current spike in coronavirus cases. She’s holding onto hope that the county amends its ban somewhat.&nbsp;“The mocktail was a great idea but I just don’t know if it’s enough to bring people in.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>At LeoGreta in Carnegie, manager Jonathan Wells announced a trio of $6 mocktails for the week: a&nbsp;blackberry honey mojito, a spicy strawberry basil Moscow mule and an apple and peach Bellini.</p>
<p>“We sold some,” said owner and Chef Greg Alauzen, in whose voice you could hear the frustration about not being able to sell alcohol. But his voice softened as he told about one regular who usually buys a bottle or two of wine who came and ordered a mocktail instead.&nbsp;“That’s one nice thing you see from your loyal customer base and it warms my heart.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mocktails aren’t typically on the menu at the Downtown cocktail bar Bourbon &amp; Bridges. Owner Steve Shaffer added five to the menu, including The Cocoon (“The Butterfly Effect that's just not old enough!”), aiming to make them “fun, creative and balanced” as they do with regular cocktails. But the place attracted zero customers on Tuesday night, he said. Business is off so much due to the ban that he plans to shut down for the holiday weekend and reconsider what to do next.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At City Works Eatery and Pourhouse on Market Square, Downtown, staffers were training this week on how to make five $6 mocktails that launch Friday on a new limited menu. The restaurant just reopened on June 24, so it wasn’t about to close less than a week later. Customers who buy $25 worth of food can get $5 off a growler of draft beer to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local group Big Burrito is also launching some. Bill Fuller posted Thursday that area Mad Mex restaurants, which already turned the margarita into the&nbsp;“Mar-Go-Rita” for takeout, will soon launch a no-alcohol version. It’s working title: “Nadarita.”&nbsp;</p>
