<p>The annual Three Rivers Arts Festival and Children’s Theater Festival that draw thousands of people Downtown have become the latest cultural casualties of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust on Tuesday issued a statement saying, “As we continue to follow the leadership of Governor Wolf and our public health officials, it is with a heavy heart that we have come to the extremely difficult decision to suspend additional Pittsburgh Cultural Trust events, extending through June 14.”</p>

<p>The original end date had been May 10.</p>
<p>The Trust continues to move arts experiences online, including virtual learning tools through Trust Arts Education Creative Connections and a taste of the canceled Bookish in the ‘Burgh festival for teens and educators.</p>
<p>“While we will not host the physical, in-person festivals this year, we are working diligently to navigate the unprecedented circumstances and scarcer resources to produce digital spaces where we can gather to celebrate these iconic festivals,” the Trust statement said.</p>
<p>In an open letter on the <a href="https://traf.trustarts.org/traf_home/pages/letter-to-the-community" target="_blank">Dollar Bank Three Rivers Arts Festival </a>website, director Sarah Aziz acknowledged patrons, sponsors and the history of the festival.</p>
<p>“For 60 years, our multidisciplinary festival has presented an array of music, dance, theater, literary arts, public art, gallery exhibitions and more, completely free of charge and open to the public, as well as an Artist Market which provides a platform and exposure for more than 300 artists,” Ms. Aziz wrote. “As much as we want to gather 500,000 people to celebrate art in all its forms this June, the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic has made this physically impossible as we continue to prioritize safety of our city and our people.”</p>
<p>Pam Komar, director of the <a href="https://pghkids.trustarts.org/about" target="_blank">EQT Children’s Theater Festival</a>, echoed the Trust mantra that “this is just intermission.”</p>
<p>“We know that nothing can ever replace the magic of the live performances and public art at the EQT Children’s Theater Festival, but our team is working diligently to bring your favorite aspects of the festival to life on the digital stage,” Ms. Komar wrote. “Several of the international and local artists who were scheduled to perform at this year’s festival are in the process of creating fun digital content and resources to nurture our love for the arts and theater until we can physically meet again.”</p>
<p>Both websites will continue to be updated with plans for bring festival features to the Trust’s online community,</p>
<p>In recent announcements, the Trust has been looking toward the fall as a time when events and activities may begin again, including the 2020-21 PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh and Trust Cabaret seasons.</p>
