<h1>Steelers place Ryan Shazier on the reserve/retired list</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers placed linebacker Ryan Shazier on the reserve/retired list, but he will continue to be part of the organization going forward.</p>
<p>Shazier, who suffered a spinal cord injury in December of 2017, spent last season on the reserve/physically unable to perform list. He received a salary but was not on the 53-man roster.</p>
<p>This is a procedural move that will give Shazier an opportunity to work for the Steelers, but he won’t draw a player salary and won’t count against the salary cap. The Steelers will retain the rights to Shazier if he can someday continue his career as a player.</p>
<p>Shazier continues to rehabilitate from his spinal cord surgery and is a regular presence around the team during the season. He has served as an unofficial intern, working with scouts and coaches during his rehab.</p>
<p>"Ryan's placement on the Reserve/Retired List serves as a matter of protocol to ensure his continued inclusion within our organization moving forward in his professional career," Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert told Steelers.com.</p>
<p>The No. 15 overall pick in the 2014 draft, Shazier started 41 games for the Steelers and earned Pro Bowl recognition following the 2016 season. He was having another Pro Bowl-caliber season in 2017 when he was injured making a tackle in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
