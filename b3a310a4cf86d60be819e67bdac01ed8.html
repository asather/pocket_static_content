<h1>GOP chairwoman extols Trump’s COVID-19 response at virtual meeting with his Pa. supporters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Appearing as a special guest on a virtual video conference with Donald Trump’s Pennsylvania-based re-election supporters on Thursday, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee encouraged volunteers to tell Pennsylvanians about how the president’s response to COVID-19 has balanced “science” with input from governors and the private sector.</p>
<p>GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, addressing dozens of campaign stakeholders and volunteers before a committee-led virtual training, said Mr. Trump’s efforts helped influence the passing of a bipartisan stimulus relief package — the CARES Act — and that his administration has helped supply Pennsylvania with the medical supplies and protective equipment it needs to combat the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Specifically, Ms. McDaniel said Pennsylvania has received more than 112,000 N-95 respirator masks, 300,000 surgical masks and hundreds of thousands of face shields and surgical gowns, and hasn’t needed to ask for more ventilators.</p>

<p>Asked to provide evidence of those figures, a spokesperson for the RNC sent <a href="https://cumberlink.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/pennsylvania-receives-about-half-of-the-personal-protective-medical-equipment-it-requested-from-federal-government/article_38494ae9-74d3-549f-9075-e8b1ea12cc06.html" target="_blank">news articles</a>&nbsp;about an April 2 report by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which showed that as of March 30, Pennsylvania had received 112,250 N95 masks, 328,500 surgical masks, 110,880 face shields and 86,304 surgical gowns.</p>
<p>The report, which drew on documents from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was intended to show that the Trump administration had&nbsp;“provided only&nbsp;a tiny fraction of what [governors and health care professionals] need,” its chairperson, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., said at the time.</p>
<p>Though the federal government provided more than 112,000 N95 masks as of March 30, Pennsylvania requested more than four times as many — and while&nbsp;it received&nbsp;328,500 surgical masks, it had asked for more than 582,000, according to <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/PA%20PPE%203-30-2020.pdf" target="_blank">FEMA documents</a> presented by the committee. Pennsylvania did receive the amount of face shields it requested.</p>
<p>The White House has insisted that it has effectively deployed supplies, and as of Tuesday, claimed federal agencies had shipped or were in the process of shipping&nbsp;38.2 million N95 respirators, 32.6 million surgical masks and 5.5 million face shields across the U.S.&nbsp;Mr. Trump has said his administration inherited&nbsp;“a stockpile where the cupboards were bare,” and this week, said the government would be sending 2 million N95 masks to Pennsylvania, specifically.</p>
<p>Ms. McDaniel said volunteers should continue to fight for Mr. Trump because he’s been fighting for them. The committee and the Trump campaign have transitioned entirely to virtual organizing since COVID-19 has limited most aspects of traditional campaigning.</p>
