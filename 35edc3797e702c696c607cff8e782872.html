<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County surpassed 1,000 probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 Saturday.</p>
<p>Reporting an increase of 62 new cases from the day before – a significant jump from the 22 new cases reported Friday – Allegheny County now has 1,009 cases of COVID19.</p>
<p>Statewide, the Pennsylvania Dept. of Health reported an additional 1,628 cases, bringing the total to 31,069.</p>
<p>The state also reported 80 new deaths Saturday, a steep increase from the 49 deaths reported Friday.</p>
<p>Allegheny County reported four additional deaths Saturday and 47 total deaths since the first case was reported March 14. The state has recorded a total of 836 deaths.</p>

<p>The increase in numbers could be due to a large amount of testing in communal living sites, labs adding results to the system in batches reflecting tests conducted over several days and an increase in probable cases as the department calls patients back, according to a press release from the Allegheny County Health Department.</p>
<p>The county includes probable cases in total counts to better assess the level of community spread. A case is probable when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a test themselves.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the county reported two new hospitalizations, bringing the total to 178 past or present hospitalizations. Of those 178, 66 patients have been admitted to the intensive care unit and 41 required medical ventilation.</p>
<p>Since the first case was confirmed on March 14, Allegheny County has administered 11,877 tests.</p>
