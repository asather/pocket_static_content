<h1>Man sentenced in racially motivated attack in Avalon bar</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man has been sentenced to one to two years in prison in connection with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2018/07/18/Police-Skinheads-assault-black-man-at-Avalon-bar-Jackman-Inn/stories/201807180191" target="_blank">the apparently racially motivated beating</a> of an Avalon man in a bar in 2018.</p>
<p>James Kryl was one of six attackers charged with ethnic intimidation, simple assault and conspiracy. They belonged to a group of alleged skinheads.</p>
<p>Kryl was tried and convicted after a jury trial before Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Beth Lazzara in September 2019.</p>
<p>In a hearing Thursday, he was sentenced to one to two years in state prison followed by five years probation. Additionally, Kryl was ordered to pay $1,000 to cover the victim’s medical costs.</p>
<p>Paul Morris, the victim, wrote in an impact statement that he “very easily could have been killed, if not for [his] size and effort to survive.”</p>
<p>On July 7, 2018, Mr. Morris, who is black, went to the bar to deliver a thank you note to a friend who worked in the kitchen, according to the statement. The note expressed gratitude for the friend’s work in making a recent family celebration — which honored his son’s graduation from high school and acceptance and scholarship to college — “perfect.”</p>
<p>Mr. Morris told police that a group of white bar patrons addressed him and his friend regarding their race, calling him a racial slur.</p>
<p>Members of the group “had tattoos stating ‘skinheads’ or with symbols associated with skinheads and several were wearing shirts with KSS (keystone state skinheads) with a doggie head inside a keystone shape,” according to police.</p>
<p>Michael Foglia, the attorney representing Kyrl, said his client had never been involved with the skinheads or any other hate group, although Kyrl had friends in the skinheads more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>When Mr. Morris and his friend went to the bar’s back deck to smoke a cigarette, the group followed them out and began verbally harassing the pair, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>When Mr. Morris attempted to return inside, someone hit him.</p>
<p>The fight then moved into the bar where witnesses said Mr. Morris fell onto the floor, and the group began punching and kicking him, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>The group left when the bartender said she was calling the police.</p>
<p>In a victim impact statement written prior to the sentencing, Mr. Morris said he had many doctors’ appointments including a trip to the emergency room, costing him over $1,000 and lost wages.</p>
<p>He also wrote that the emotional toll was greater than the physical one.</p>
<p>In his neighborhood, he is known as “a church going, family man,” and tries every day to model forgiveness, he wrote in the statement, and although he wanted to be able to “continue to preach ‘live and let live, turn the other cheek, offer forgiveness, let justice take its course, and leave the path behind you,’” this case made him question the fairness of the law.</p>
<p>Of the group of six initially charged, Crystal Lynn Shields, 23, of Tarentum, is the only remaining defendant, according to the district attorney’s office. Her trial is set for Feb. 10.</p>
