<h1>North Side man wanted for hit and run in Troy Hill </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An arrest warrant has been issued for a North Side man who police say injured a pedestrian Friday evening by striking the man with his car in Troy Hill.</p>
<p>A 63-year-old man was hit on his left side by a small black Audi around 6 p.m. at Goettman Street and Troy Hill Road, according to a criminal complaint. Taemon Posey, 24, was charged Sunday with&nbsp;accidents involving death or injury while not licensed, and failure to stop and give information, or render aid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The injured man was taken to a hospital in stable condition. Mr. Posey had not been arrested or turned himself in as of Monday afternoon, court records show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several witnesses told police that following the accident they saw a thin man exit his car and look at the older man as he lay on the ground, before driving away. The older man’s daughter — who was parked on Goettman Street and waiting for her dad to cross when he was struck — told police the man who hit her father asked if he was OK, and said he would move his car from the street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he drove away and never came back, the criminal complaint said. Police reviewed surveillance footage from the area that showed the car leaving the scene. One witness provided police dash cam footage that showed the accident and make and model of car Mr. Posey drove. The video corroborated witness accounts, and police also noted Mr. Posey’s distinct&nbsp;“long curved sideburns.”</p>
<p>Authorities said they recognized Mr. Posey from previous arrests due to his distinct facial hair, thin build and the car he drove. He was already wanted by state police&nbsp;on charges of DUI, careless driving, and other traffic violations stemming from a Feb 2019 incident, court records show.</p>
<p>A search of Mr. Posey’s records led authorities to find a car on the North Side sometime after Friday’s accident that matched the Audi seen in video footage. The vehicle also appeared to have sustained recent damage to the front bumper, the criminal complaint said. Police said the car is registered to a known friend of Mr. Posey.</p>
<p>Anyone with information should call police at 412-323-7201.</p>
