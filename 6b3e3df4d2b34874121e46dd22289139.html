<h1>Students at WVU, La Roche could face discipline for not following new COVID-19 protocols</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Students returning to West Virginia University in Morgantown and La Roche University in McCandless already have some COVID-19 homework to complete before the fall term begins.</p>
<p>Testing for the coronavirus will be required for all WVU students and employees before they return to campus in the fall, said an email, sent Tuesday, from Dean of Students G. Corey Farris. The email also said students must complete an “education module” on the virus before returning; Mr. Farris didn’t release details about the module, but said information would be available before the end of the month.</p>
<p>Preregistration for the COVID-19 tests, which will be provided by the university, is required. Students who fail to complete either requirement are subject to a $250 fee and a referral to West Virginia’s Office of Student Conduct, the email said.</p>
<p>Students are scheduled to return to the Morgantown campus from Aug. 8 through Aug. 15. Those moving in to residence halls must schedule a move-in time and date, Mr. Ferris said in the statement.</p>
<p>The school will send more information to students in the upcoming weeks, the email said.</p>
<p>At La Roche, returning students and employees will sign a health and safety pledge before the term begins.&nbsp;The pledge states they will follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, self-isolate if they feel ill and participate in testing and contact tracing as necessary, according to plans released Monday.</p>
<p>The pledge also acknowledges that La Roche cannot guarantee students and employees will not be exposed to COVID-19 and that they should continue to care for their health and wellness.</p>
<p>Students who do not adhere to the pledge are subject to disciplinary action, the university said, including a potential eviction from the residence halls. Employees will be required to sign a separate pledge.</p>
<p>Resident students are required to fill out an additional questionnaire about an emergency plan for coronavirus exposure before they receive their room keys.</p>
<p>In addition to the health pledge, students on campus must wear a mask in all public areas of campus, indoors and outside.</p>
<p>There also will be daily temperature checks for everyone on campus — students, faculty, staff and visitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Classes at La Roche are scheduled to begin on Aug. 17 and will conclude Nov. 24. Finals week will follow virtually.</p>
<p>La Roche is introducing “Hi-Flex” courses, a hybrid class that only requires students to be in the classroom once weekly, while the rest of the course is completed virtually.</p>
<p>With the goal of reducing the number of people on campus by 50%, the university is also providing a larger selection of online-only classes, to allow for adequate social distancing.</p>
