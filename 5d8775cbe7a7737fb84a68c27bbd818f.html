<h1>Gastrobar chain Bar Louie files for bankruptcy </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bar Louie, a gastrobar chain with two locations in Pittsburgh, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday.</p>
<p>As of Monday, the company closed 38 underperforming locations, and now operates 72 owned locations and 24 franchised locations.</p>
<p>Locally, it operates one restaurant on the North Shore and another at the Waterfront in Homestead. The gastrobar said it will continue to run its remaining more than 90 restaurants as usual through its bankruptcy proceedings, which it expects to exit in 90 days.</p>
<p>The company also announced it reached a deal with its lenders to act as the “stalking horse” purchaser for the chain’s remaining assets. A stalking horse bid essentially sets a minimum bid. Bar Louie said it has received commitments from its lenders for debtor-in-possession financing, giving it the money to continue operations and handle other expenses.</p>
<p>"Bar Louie is a profitable business focused on long-term growth with new investors,” Tom Fricke, CEO of Bar Louie said in a press release. “The sale through Chapter 11 will help us to focus on our profitable core locations and expand in areas that have a proven track record of success."</p>
