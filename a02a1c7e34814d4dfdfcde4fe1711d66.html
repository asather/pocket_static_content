<h1>Some pros and cons of Leonard Fournette to the Steelers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Jacksonville Jaguars in recent days have reportedly put top five draft pick Leonard Fournette on the trade block.</p>
<p>That has prompted some widespread speculation that the Steelers should be a potential landing spot for the 25-year-old.</p>

<p>There’s no indication that Fournette to the Steelers is on the table right now. But given the chatter, let’s look at some pros and cons of Fournette in the black and gold:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Pros</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. They wouldn’t need to draft a running back —</strong> The position is considered one of their biggest weaknesses because of starter James Conner’s lengthy injury history. The Post-Gazette’s Ray Fittipaldo has projected the team will <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/22/Ray-Fittipaldo-s-final-Steelers-seven-round-mock-draft/stories/202004220027" target="_blank">select a running back</a> with its second-round pick in multiple mock drafts over the past few months. But if Jacksonville only seeks, say, a fourth-round pick, then the Steelers could add the league’s seventh-leading rusher in 2019 for what would amount to a two-round discount. The trade-off would be less contractual control.&nbsp;Fournette can hit free agency as soon as this offseason if the Steelers deal for him and decline his fifth-year option. (More on that in a bit.) But at least they’d have the flexibility to use their second-round pick on another need and punt on the long-term decision about what to do at with the backs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. He can be an option in the passing game —</strong> Fournette shattered his career highs with 76 receptions for 522 yards a year ago. That’s a healthy average of 6.9 yards per catch and shows he can fit into a Steelers offense that’s been at its best in recent years when it’s been able to pile up targets to its backs. Remember Le’Veon Bell’s gaudy scrimmage numbers? Fournette’s production suggests he could replicate them by catching his share of passes, provide a steady hand in the ground game and help keep Conner fresh to do what he does best at pounding away between the tackles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. His own injury risk is mitigated by Conner’s presence —</strong> Fournette has missed 12 games with injuries in his three-year career, so there is a valid question about his reliability. It’s just not one the Steelers need to dwell on too much because that’s pretty much the situation they have already with Conner. Pair the two, and you can reasonably expect to have a bonafide feature back available for all 16 games. And when they’re both healthy, you can ride the hot hand confidently knowing there’s depth behind him.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Cons</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Neither his traditional, nor his advanced stats are great —</strong> For his career, he’s averaged a mediocre number of exactly 4.0 yards per carry on the ground. That figure got a bit of a boost to 4.3 in 2019, but even that doesn’t scream “productive.” On the advanced front, <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/rb/2019" target="_blank">Football Outsiders</a> had him at 34 yards above replacement level in 2019 and pegged his value over average at minus-8.6%. That put him just two spots above Conner and three spots ahead of backup Benny Snell among backs with at least 100 attempts. You can read more about the methodology of those newer stats <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/02/15/leveon-bell-trade-rumors-nfl-free-agency-james-conner/stories/201902140182%0D%0A" target="_blank">here</a>, but the important to know is that there’s no clear sign he’s an upgrade on what the Steelers have. He could solidify their depth, but statistically, we’re not talking about a big fish jumping into a little pond, despite his draft pedigree and the college fame that’s followed him from LSU. We’re talking about someone who looks like more of the same until he proves otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. He’d eat up salary cap space —</strong> Sportrac has the Steelers at around $5.7 million below the cap. Fournette is due a little more than $4 million, so adding him would really limit flexibility moving forward. Granted, restructurings make cap math an inexact science. The Steelers could probably find a way to make a Minkah Fitzpatrick-type trade work midseason if they wanted to. The question is whether Fournette is worth making such propositions more complicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. The fifth-year option is a tricky decision to make quickly —</strong> General manager Kevin Colbert and company would have to make the call by May 4, before they get to see Fournette in black and gold. Picking the option up would give him a healthy raise and further reduce flexibility for next offseason. Declining presents the risk of losing him in free agency for nothing should he play well in 2020. There is no obvious right answer at the moment, so it’s reasonable to ask whether adding all of that uncertainty is worth it when compared to drafting a younger back who could potentially have more upside over a longer period of time.</p>
