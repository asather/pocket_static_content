<h1>Gov. Wolf: Pro sports can resume in yellow, green Pennsylvania counties</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania sports fans have been waiting for this particular declaration from Gov. Tom Wolf’s office since the COVID-19 pandemic began two-and-a-half months ago.</p>
<p>Wolf announced Wednesday that any professional sports team in a Pennsylvania county that is at the “yellow” or “green” phase of reopening <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-issues-updated-green-phase-order-guidance-on-dining-and-professional-sports/" target="_blank">can begin practicing and playing games</a> once their respective leagues come up with a safe way to resume games. Fans, however, will still not be allowed to attend these events due to issues concerning crowd sizes.</p>
<p>Teams will be able to return to play once the Pennsylvania Department of Health approves their plans for “testing or screening and monitoring of all on-venue players and personnel,” among other requirements.</p>
<p>The announcement specifically defined “professional sports” as “any sporting event at which the participants are paid by a league or team, or at which individuals or teams receive prizes or purse,” which excludes college or high school sports from this new guidance.</p>
<p>Allegheny County is currently in the “yellow” phase, which means the Steelers, Pirates and Penguins will be allowed to resume basic team activities once the NFL, MLB and NHL allows their players to do so.</p>
<p>“We opened our facility last Tuesday, May 19, and have adhered to the policies and guidelines from government and health officials as well as the National Football League,” Steelers spokesman Burt Lauten told the Post-Gazette in an emailed statement. “We appreciate the guidance from the governor’s office as we make plans to safely prepare for the 2020 season.”</p>
<p>While Major League Baseball’s return is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/05/26/Union-extremely-disappointed-MLB-economic-proposal-time-running-out-2020-season/stories/202005260123" target="_blank">currently in labor limbo</a> and the NFL is still in its offseason, the NHL on Tuesday announced its <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/05/26/NHL-adopts-24-team-playoff-format-if-it-can-resume-season/stories/202005260106" target="_blank">potential return-to-play plan</a> that might involve Pittsburgh <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/27/nhl-hub-city-pittsburgh-penguins-covid-19-allegheny-county/stories/202005270116" target="_blank">acting as a “hub city”</a> where the top 12 Eastern Conference teams will play out the remainder of the 2019-20 season. Wolf’s guidance may make Pittsburgh a more attractive destination to host this year’s unique playoff games.</p>
