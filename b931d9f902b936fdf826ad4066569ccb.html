<h1>Mike Sullivan's toughest coaching test is about to begin</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Many have argued that this year has been Mike Sullivan’s best coaching job. That’s certainly saying something for someone who won back-to-back Stanley Cups in his first 18 months on the job. Yet, during a season filled with injury and adversity, the Penguins have been defined by their ability to respond.</p>
<p>Now, as the NHL prepares to open training camps in less than two weeks, the toughest task might lie ahead.</p>
<p>The league is planning to open formal training camps July 10, although that date could reportedly be pushed back to July 13. The NHLPA and NHL are working to iron out the start dates and finalize details on Phase 3 and Phase 4 protocols, which would allow the league to formally announce hub cities for postseason action. Toronto is reportedly expected to host Eastern Conference games, with Edmonton housing the West.</p>
<p>Once everything is in place, Sullivan will have just a few weeks to take a team that hasn’t played a game since March 10 in New Jersey and prepare it for a 24-team tournament unlike anyone has ever seen.</p>
<p>“The logistics and the circumstances are very different than coming into a training camp in September at the beginning of the season when you have an 82-game schedule in front of you,” Sullivan said. “We’re essentially going to start competing in the highest stakes environment that’s presented to us.”</p>
<p>During a conference call on Wednesday, Sullivan said the Penguins now have their full complement of players in Pittsburgh. Sweden native Patric Hornqvist was the last to arrive and is currently completing the mandated quarantining and testing procedure.</p>
<p>To prepare for the rare circumstances surrounding camp, the Penguins coaching staff has been meeting virtually two-to-three times a week since the NHL officially paused the season March 12. They’ve also been holding breakout sessions with players in which they drill down on specific team concepts to keep the vocabulary and mental aspect of the game sharp.</p>
<p>Once camps open, Sullivan said there will be much less player evaluation than a typical camp and more emphasis on establishing chemistry and team concepts.</p>
<p>“We’re going to put our guys through game simulations,” Sullivan said. “We’re going to have intrasquad games throughout the course of training camp to make sure we give our guys an opportunity to feel the game-day scenario and put their bodies through that process so that we can help with that transition back to that competitive mindset that’s so necessary to have success in this league.”</p>
<p>In the NBA and MLB, several players have already begun to opt out of returning to play. The NHL’s plan is also expected to have a similar provision.</p>
<p>“Of all the discussions I’ve had with our players, I’m unaware of anyone that has that sort of concern,” Sullivan said. “All of us understand the risk associated with the return to play. We also trust that the league is doing everything within their power to control what they can to mitigate those risks as best they can.”</p>
<p>Sullivan said he’s had a discussion with 67-year-old assistant coach Jacques Martin and expects all members of his coaching staff to join him behind the bench. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19 increases as you get older., and 8 out of 10 COVID-19-related deaths reported in the United States have been among adults aged 65 years and older.</p>
<p>But Sullivan believes it’s Martin’s right to make his own decisions, and Martin feels comfortable participating in a full capacity.</p>
<p>“He does a great job from a fitness standpoint taking care of himself,” Sullivan said. “He’s a healthy guy. He feels as though he’s strong and healthy for his age. He also understands the risks associated with it.”</p>
<p>During such an unconventional season, there’s an argument to be made that leadership matters now more than ever. Sullivan said the number of veterans on the team, including Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang, will ease the transition back to the ice.</p>
<p>“These guys have been through a lot in their careers,” Sullivan said. “Because of that, they have the benefit of perspective. I think it serves them well in uncertain times like this. I know in the discussions I’ve had with our guys — and in particular our leadership group — these guys look at what’s in front of us as a great opportunity.”</p>
<p>When the games begin, no one knows exactly what to expect. With cases of COVID-19 surging in the U.S. and still details to iron out in the collective bargaining agreement, it’s still not out of the realm of possibilities that the best-made plans could be delayed or even derailed.&nbsp;But for now, the Penguins’ focus is the same as when camp opened 10 months ago.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to the opportunity to compete for the Stanley Cup,” Sullivan said. “That’s really how we look at it, regardless of where the hub cities are at or who our opponent is or what the rules are or what the format is. We’re really not interested in that stuff. We’re interested in trying to compete to win a Stanley Cup. That’s where the focus and the mindset of this group is at.”</p>
