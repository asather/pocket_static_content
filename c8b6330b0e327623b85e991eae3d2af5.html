<h1>Coronavirus woes spur Hong Kong to impose a quarantine on all from mainland China</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hong Kong authorities said Wednesday morning that they will begin requiring people who arrive from mainland China to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine, as it tries to reduce the potential for imported cases of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s top official, has resisted demands from some lawmakers and medical workers to completely close off the border, calling it discriminatory and not in line with World Health Organization guidelines.</p>
<p>But she has enacted a series of measures, including closing all but three border crossings, which have resulted in a sharp drop in entries from the mainland.</p>
<p>Lam said that Hong Kong now had 21 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including three that were transmitted locally. The government will also allocate $1.3 billion to help fight the outbreak, she said.</p>
<p>One of the confirmed cases involved someone working at the Kowloon Commerce Center, a hub of multinational firms, according to an internal note sent to employees at the Bank of America, which has an office in one of the towers.</p>
<p>Separately, the Hong Kong government will also shut cruise terminals in the city.&nbsp;That was announced as a cruise ship that left Hong Kong on Sunday was turned around by authorities in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on Wednesday, after three passengers on a previous trip were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The World Dream left the mainland Chinese city of Guangzhou on Jan. 19, returning from Vietnam five days later. Three passengers on that journey were confirmed on Monday to have the new coronavirus, the company, Star Cruises, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The building’s management office did not respond to a request for comment, and Bank of America declined to comment.</p>
<p>The news from Hong Kong came as Taiwan said that beginning on Thursday it would temporarily suspend entry by Chinese citizens who live on the mainland. It previously announced that foreigners who had been to mainland China over the previous 14 days would not be allowed to enter Taiwan.</p>
