<h1>Pittsburgh real estate company moving into the New York City suburbs with latest deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>O’Hara-based Howard Hanna Real Estate Services took a big bite out of the Empire State with a transaction that closed late Tuesday to partner with one of New York’s largest real estate companies — Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty.</p>
<p>The deal —&nbsp;two years in the making — includes the purchase of one office located in the city of New York and 27 offices throughout the suburbs of New York State and New Jersey. That positions Howard Hanna to take advantage of the movement of people from the densely populated city of New York to smaller towns on the outskirts, said Howard “Hoddy” Hanna III, the company’s chairman.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Mr. Hanna said the acquisition will make Howard Hanna Real Estate the largest home seller in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and South Carolina.</p>
<p>“I pinch myself everyday. It’s hard to believe,” Mr. Hanna said.</p>
<p>Rand Realty is a franchise of Better Homes and Gardens and has established a presence in the suburban markets in New York and New Jersey. The company reported closed sales volume of more than $2 billion in 2019, with more than 6,000 homes sold.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Rand Realty, according to the announcement of the deal, has more than 1,000 residential real estate sales associates, as well as a commercial real estate arm and an operation that provide title services, mortgage lending and other services.</p>
<p>“It’s a massive deal,” Mr. Hanna said. “For us, it’s a great beach head. They say if you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere.”</p>
<p>In 2019, Howard Hanna had total closed sales volume of more than $22 billion in all of its combined markets, with sales of more than 100,000 houses, according to the company’s announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Howard Hanna Real Estate has 325 offices in 10 states, and reports having more than 11,000 sales associates and staff.</p>
