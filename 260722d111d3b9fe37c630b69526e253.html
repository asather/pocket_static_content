<html><head><title>Conservative group warns county to clean up voter rolls</title></head><body><p>The conservative organization Judicial Watch is threatening to sue Allegheny County for allegedly not properly managing its voter rolls.</p><p>The county is not alone. The nonprofit sent “notice of violation” letters to 19 counties in Pennsylvania, California, Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia.</p><p>The Dec. 11 letter addressed to former Allegheny County Council President John DeFazio alleges that the county violated the National Voter Registration Act by “removing only 72 voter registrations in the last two year reporting period[s].” The organization also claims that the county has an “implausibly high registration rate of 98%.” The numbers are based on the organization’s own analysis.</p><p>County officials dispute that analysis, citing publicly available information.</p><p>“The 2019 general election results show a voter registration of 957,735. Our population is approx. 1.25 million — just with those numbers, that’s 76.6%, not 98%,” Amie Downs, county spokeswoman, said in an email Friday night.</p><p>Current County Council President Patrick Catena declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. DeFazio’s last day in office was Dec. 10. He said Friday he had not heard of the threatened lawsuit.</p><p>The letter also was addressed to Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar. Along with Allegheny County, the organization notified Bucks, Chester and Delaware counties.</p><p>Judicial Watch is largely funded by the Sarah Scaife Foundation. The organization had roughly 50 employees and an annual budget of $35 million as of 2016.</p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/01/04/Conservative-group-warns-county-to-clean-up-voter-rolls/stories/202001040032</original_url>
