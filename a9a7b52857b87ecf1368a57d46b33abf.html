<p>DETROIT —&nbsp;Joe Biden faced down a pro-gun autoworker Tuesday morning in a testy exchange over his plan to reinstate the assault weapons ban.</p>
<p>Biden spoke at a&nbsp;Chrysler-Fiat plant in Detroit on Tuesday and then was confronted by a worker in a hard hat who accused him of “actively trying to end our Second Amendment right.” Biden told the worker he was “full of sh-t” and hushed an aide who was trying to end the conversation.</p>
<p>“I support the Second Amendment,” the former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate said. “I have a 20-gauge, 12-gauge. My sons hunt."</p>
<p>Biden went on to say he supports the Second Amendment but added: “Do you need 100 rounds?”</p>
<p>The worker pointed to a “viral video” in which he alleged Biden said he would take away people’s guns.</p>
<p>"You were with Beto and you said you were going to take our guns," the man said. He was referring to Beto O'Rourke, the former El Paso congressman who memorably declared at a Houston presidential debate in September that "hell, yes, we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47."&nbsp;Conservatives have pelted Biden in the last eight days for his alliance with O'Rourke.)</p>
<p>Biden replied that he “did not say that” and that the video was “lying.”</p>
<p>Biden said he has supported a ban on assault rifles, including the AR-14. He was no doubt referring to AR-15s, the most popular rifle in America, with an estimated 17.7 million in private hands.</p>
<p>The former VP continued: "Here's the deal. Are you able to own a machine gun?"</p>
<p>"Machine guns are illegal," the man said.</p>
<p>"That's right. Well AR-15s [should be] illegal," Biden said.</p>
<p>Biden otherwise received an overwhelmingly positive response from the autoworkers while courting the union vote in a final push as Michigan residents vote in the presidential primary.</p>
