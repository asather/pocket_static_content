<p>A group of Pittsburgh Penguins helped provide a warm meal to kids and their families who normally rely on schools and community pantries for their meals.</p>
<p>Teddy Blueger, Tristan Jarry, Sam Lafferty and John Marino donated 500 personal pizzas. Fox’s Pizza Den matched for a total of 1,000 pizzas.</p>
<p>The pizzas were delivered to Northview Heights Housing on the North Side, the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Western Pennsylvania in McKees Rocks, the Turtle Creek Ambulance Station, the Tarentum Marina and White Lily Baptist Church in Chartiers City.</p>
<p>“We are proud of our players for continuing to step forward in this way to assist members of our community,” Penguins president and CEO David Morehouse said. “During these challenging times, it’s important for all of us to come together in support of those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.”</p>
