<h1>With no fireworks, parades or taverns, the Fourth was different this year </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For sisters Katie and Jacie&nbsp;Eisel, celebrating the Fourth of July has always been a big tradition in their family. Every year, they would go to the annual Brentwood Fourth of July Celebration – where their father grew up – and watch the parade filled with marching bands and vibrant floats that would draw in thousands of cheering people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Today was our dad’s birthday, so the Fourth is really big for us because we kind of remember him for that. But ultimately, the day itself just makes you feel proud,” Jacie Eisel said Saturday.</p>
<p>“It reminds me what you’re thankful for living in America and spending time with your family and it’s just a day that’s important all around for us,” Katie Eisel added.</p>
<p>However this year, the Eisel sisters said the celebration had been canceled. Instead, the were sitting under the shade of a tree on the lawn at Point State Park with their children, trying to make the best out of the hot summer day. Later, they planned to try to catch a fireworks show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But they wouldn’t be doing it at Point State Park, which is usually packed with people waiting for the Fourth of July show but attracted only a few dozen people Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Like Brentwood’s annual celebration, the fireworks show at the Point was also canceled due to the pandemic, which turned Independence Day into one devoid of many usual festivities in the region and around the country. For those who didn’t travel to the few fireworks shows that still went on — with safe distancing in cars for some — it was a day to relax or host their own barbecue.</p>
<p>Not that there weren’t fireworks near the Point.</p>
<p>At around 10 a.m., boats coasted into the South Side Marina, waving Trump 2020 flags and Blue Lives Matter flags for the&nbsp;“4th of July Trump Team PA Boat Parade and MAGA Rally” that was planned for 11 a.m. until 1 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the event started, hundreds of protesters from organizations Pittsburgh I Can’t Breathe, Project Matters, TransYOUniting, LGBTQ Coalition and more came to the marina to&nbsp;“shut it down.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dressed in all black and holding signs that read&nbsp;“Defund the Police,” protesters chanted&nbsp;“No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA” as supporters of President Donald Trum played “God Bless the U.S.A.” on their boat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At around 11 a.m., around 40 boats started down the Monongahela River towards The Point as protesters went onto the Hot Metal Bridge. One of them, Nicole Basham, said it felt good to see more protesters than boats on the marina.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Basham, 38, of Grove City, said this is her seventh protest this year.&nbsp;“We have to get him out of the office,” Ms. Basham said.&nbsp;“I actually voted for Trump. I was a Republican literally until quarantine when I watched him every day for 30 days. I used to think it was Black people not liking him, but I realized it’s because he’s probably one of the most racist people here. And the fact that he runs the country makes me want to cry.”</p>
<p>Tricia Cunningham, the organizer of the boat rally, said she thought it was a successful turnout.</p>
<p>“If we have one boat with us, it’s a success,” Ms. Cunningham said. “It’s amazing, the energy out here.” She said she invited leaders from the counter-protesters to&nbsp;“sit down and have a talk” with her, but she said she didn’t receive a reply.&nbsp;“Because I was watching the news and saw one of the protester’s posters that said ‘say their name’ with pictures of faces. I want to hear all their stories.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two sides met again on the pier on the North Side where police with horses intervened. Both groups then eventually moved away from one another. Protesters then continued to take to the streets at another protest that started at 3 p.m. in Market Square and lasted for more than three hours before it peacefully broke up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the protests that happened throughout the city, streets that would have been busy for the Fourth of July were silent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On East Carson Street, where people would go to the bars before heading to see the fireworks show at the Point, only a handful of people were seen walking on the sidewalk in the late afternoon. Most businesses, such as Jimmy D’s, Steel Cactus, and Mario’s were closed after Allegheny County shut down bars and restaurants on Thursday because of a spike in COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Jessica Hinsch and her friend Moua Lee were among the few walking around. Ms. Hinsch said she was showing the city to Mr. Lee, who was visiting for the weekend from his home in Wisconsin, when they decided to pick up some beer for take out at Fat Head’s Saloon – one of the few restaurants that was open for take out only on East Carson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Fat Head’s, kitchen manager Averill “Apple” Grimes said Fourth of July is usually packed every year until 8 p.m. when everyone heads to the Point to see the fireworks. On Saturday, the restaurant was empty, with a skeleton crew there to finish take out orders.</p>
<p>“Since last week when we weren’t allowed to sell liquor, dining slowed down and then they hit us with no dine-in at all, so our business came to a halt. We’re still doing to-go’s but not as many as before, not as many as during quarantine,” Mr. Grimes, 41, of Brentwood, said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The phones should be ringing off the house,” he said,&nbsp;noting that the restaurant had to cut one of the line-cooks on Saturday because they weren’t getting enough business. Fat Head’s was closing one hour earlier Saturday at 9 p.m. due to the light business. Mr. Averill said he hopes the county’s orders will only last for a week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the nearby Three Rivers Vintage clothing store, worker Kayla Leidtke said she would also closing early due to the light amount of business – one customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think a couple of our die-hard fans definitely are always coming through to support us, but our normal Saturday foot traffic is around 200 people. But with everything, it’s been very minimal,” Ms. Ledtke said. Instead, her store has kept busy with internet sales, one thing the coronavirus has been unable to shut down.&nbsp;</p>
