<h1>Fourth line is a question mark for the Penguins, at least for the moment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>TAMPA, Fla. – When Sam Lafferty put a shot past Washington Capitals goalie Ilya Samsonov in Sunday’s win, it didn’t just snap his scoreless skid. It was the first goal the Penguins received from their fourth line in nearly three weeks.</p>
<p>Of course, most teams don’t expect much scoring from their fourth line, and the Penguins are no exception. But with two months left in the regular season, there doesn’t appear to be a clear identity for their mishmashed fourth line, which on Thursday was Lafferty between Alex Galchenyuk and Anthony Angello.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan was asked before Thursday’s game against the Tampa Bay Lightning at Amalie Arena what he would like the identity of that line to be.</p>
<p>“We want them to continue to play to the identity of the Penguins,” he said. “And I think simplicity is an important aspect of that, just making sure that we make good decisions, that we force teams to play 200 feet, that we stay on the right side of pucks, all of the details that we talk about daily with our guys.”</p>
<p>But in the team’s three games prior to Thursday, the Penguins allowed 13 scoring chances in just over 18 minutes with Galchenyuk on the ice at 5-on-5, per NaturalStatTrick.com, and opponents attempted twice as many shots.</p>
<p>Galchenyuk, hardly a hard-nosed player, still looks lost in his limited ice time.</p>
<p>Lafferty had gone 16 games without a goal before Sunday but occasionally flashes two-way potential. Angello, who made his NHL debut last week, is a big, physical winger whose skating and skill level are a question mark at this level.</p>
<p>Andrew Agozzino, a healthy scratch the last two games, was named an American Hockey League All-Star this season. But the center hasn’t chipped in much offense in Pittsburgh and too often gets knocked off the puck.</p>
<p>Injuries up the lineup have led to a revolving door on that line. Three weeks ago Patric Hornqvist was skating with Galchenyuk and Agozzino and they did some good things. Then Dominik Kahun suffered a concussion and Hornqvist got bumped back up into the top six, leading to a different fourth-line trio.</p>
<p>If Kahun and Nick Bjugstad at some point return, or if general manager Jim Rutherford is able to trade for a forward or two, perhaps then the Penguins will be able to get four lines rolling. But for now, the fourth line is a concern.</p>
<p><strong>Kahun skates, ‘making progress’</strong></p>
<p>Sullivan on Thursday provided updates on Kahun, Bjugstad and another injured player Brian Dumoulin, none of whom traveled with the team to Florida.</p>
<p>Sullivan said Kahun, who suffered a concussion against Boston on Jan. 19 and has sat out the four games since, skated Thursday “and is making progress.”</p>
<p>Bjugstad and Dumoulin, meanwhile, have not been skating back in Pittsburgh, the coach said, adding that both players have been rehabbing off the ice.</p>
<p>Bjugstad, who had surgery to repair a core muscle in November, had been skating last month but hasn’t been spotted on the ice in three-plus weeks. Dumoulin had surgery to repair lacerated tendons in his left ankle on Dec. 1.</p>
<p><strong>Tanev exceeding expectations</strong></p>
<p>Brandon Tanev entered Thursday’s game first on the Penguins with 192 hits, first among their forwards in blocked shots and sixth on the team in takeaways.</p>
<p>“I think he’s the guy we thought we were getting and then some,” Sullivan said of the winger, who signed a six-year, $21 million extension this past summer.</p>
<p>The “and then some” would be scoring. Tanev had 11 goals and 23 points through 52 games, putting him on pace to blow by his career highs. Entering Thursday, he had four game-winners, including one Sunday in Washington.</p>
<p>“He’s been a real important player for us,” Sullivan said. “We knew he was going to be a guy that was going to bring us an element of speed, an element of physicality. We knew that he was going to be hard to play against. But he’s really adding an offensive dimension as well. He’s really scored some big goals.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Tampa has a great chance’</strong></p>
<p>Evgeni Malkin was asked about countryman Nikita Kucherov, the reigning MVP who is looking to add a Stanley Cup to his resume. Malkin gave high praise to a Tampa Bay team that has another Russian in goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy along with other recent All-Stars in Victor Hedman and Steven Stamkos.</p>
<p>“I think Tampa has a great chance. It’s not easy for sure. But they have a good team. They have everything – goalie, defensemen, power play, forwards,” he said. “We have good team, too. Washington has good team. Boston. It’s not easy.”</p>
<p>The Penguins will host this Lightning team at PPG Paints Arena on Tuesday.</p>
