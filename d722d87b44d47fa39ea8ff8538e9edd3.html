<h1>Robison sisters lead Rochester to finals berth in victory over Clairton</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rochester had never even played for a WPIAL championship until last season.</p>
<p>The Rams are now a win away from capturing their second straight title.</p>
<p>Rochester’s Robison sisters, Alexis and Mekenzie, combined to score 35 points, and the Rams used a stout defensive performance to throttle Clairton, 57-37, in a Class 1A semifinal Tuesday at Moon.</p>
<p>Alexis, a junior, scored a game-high 19 points, and sophomore Mekenzie added 16. They vaulted the defending champion and top-seeded Rams (23-1) into Friday’s final, where they will take on unbeaten West Greene (24-0) at 3 p.m. at Petersen Events Center. The Rams beat West Greene in last year’s final.</p>
<p>“I’d be kidding if I wasn’t thrilled,” said Rochester coach C.J. Iannini. “We’re super excited for our program. It’s huge for our town and huge for our community.”</p>
<p>Rochester’s high-powered offense never did get on track against Clairton — the Rams shot 35% (22 of 62) from the field — but because of the way the Rams were playing defense, it wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p>After limiting Aquinas Academy to six first-half points and 24 overall in the quarterfinals, Rochester stymied Clairton, particularly in the first half when the Bears were just 4 of 28 from the field and committed 14 turnovers as they fell behind, 29-12. For the game, the Bears shot 26% (15 of 56).</p>
<p>“Coach C.J. preached at the beginning of the season that defense is going to win everything for us, and he’s right,” Mekenzie Robison said.</p>
<p>Iyauna Chapman and Taylor Jackson led Clairton (20-4) with 10 points apiece. The Bears, who had won 10 games in a row, were playing in the semifinals for the first time since 2005.</p>
<p><strong>Other semifinal</strong></p>
<p>Greene County is certainly no bustling metropolis, but the basketball players sure know how to get downtown.</p>
<p>In a WPIAL Class 1A semifinal game in which points were at a premium, the Pioneers sank three 3-pointers in the third quarter and four in the second half to escape with a 46-45 victory against Sewickley Academy.</p>
<p>Brooke Barner netted 14 points and Jersey Wise had 13 to pace the Pioneers.</p>
<p>West Greene was held scoreless for the first 4:18 of the third quarter before Wise nailed back-to-back 3s 30 seconds apart. Elizabeth Brudnock dropped in another as the quarter was winding down. In the fourth, Barner hit another 3 and Brudnock got three points the old fashioned way as she was fouled while making a close-range shot.</p>
<p>“We shoot a lot of 3s,” said West Greene coach Jordan Watson. “Jersey had two daggers and Elizabeth had one in the third. Brooke Barner hadn’t hit one in a long time — she’s a four [position] — and she had a big dagger in the fourth.”</p>
<p>A poor shooting effort from the floor and the foul line doomed the Panthers (14-11). They were just 2 for 17 from the free-throw line. In the last 30 seconds of the game, they missed five shot attempts from inside the paint. That includes a missed layup and putback with 6.8 second remaining while trailing by one point.</p>
