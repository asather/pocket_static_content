<p>ANKARA, Turkey — The president of Turkey on Friday formally converted Istanbul’s sixth-century Hagia Sophia back into a mosque and declared it open for Muslim worship, hours after a high court annulled a 1934 decision that had made the religious landmark a museum.</p>
<p>The decision sparked deep dismay among Orthodox Christians. Originally a cathedral, Hagia Sophia was turned into a mosque after Istanbul’s conquest by the Ottoman Empire but had been a museum for the past 86 years, drawing millions of tourists annually.</p>
<p>There was jubilation outside the terra-cotta-hued structure with its cascading domes and four minarets. Dozens of people awaiting the court’s ruling chanted, “Allah is great!” when the news broke. A large crowd later prayed outside it.</p>
<p>In the capital of Ankara, legislators stood and applauded as the decision was read in Parliament.</p>
<p>Turkey’s high administrative court threw its weight behind a petition brought by a religious group and annulled the 1934 Cabinet decision that turned the site into a museum. Within hours, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signed a decree handing over Hagia Sophia to Turkey’s Religious Affairs Presidency.</p>
<p>In an address to the nation, Mr. Erdogan said the first prayers inside Hagia Sofia would be held on July 24 and urged respect for the decision.</p>
<p>“I underline that we will open Hagia Sophia to worship as a mosque by preserving its character of humanity’s common cultural heritage,” he said, adding: “It is Turkey’s sovereign right to decide for which purpose Hagia Sofia will be used.”</p>
<p>Mr. Erdogan had spoken in favor of turning the hugely symbolic UNESCO World Heritage site back into a mosque despite widespread international criticism, including from U.S. and Orthodox Christian leaders and politicians in Greece, Cyprus and Russia.</p>
