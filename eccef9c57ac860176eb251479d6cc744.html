<h1>Paul Zeise: Expanded College Football Playoff? Sure, but no more than eight teams</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NCAA has lost hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that number could climb into the billions if the football season is shortened or takes place without fans.</p>
<p>A number of measures are apparently already being considered by athletic directors and school presidents to try and recoup some of those losses.&nbsp;One easy money grab will be to expand the College Football Playoff to include more teams, and <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/why-the-fiscal-fallout-from-covid-19-will-lead-to-college-football-playoff-expansion-160851276.html" target="_blank">according to Yahoo Sports reporter Pete Thamel</a>, that is almost assuredly going to happen.</p>
<p>Thamel talked to a number of officials around college football and reported that it is pretty clear this is likely to happen. <a href="https://twitter.com/PeteThamel/status/1250106149900374022?s=20" target="_blank">Thamel also reported</a>&nbsp;that athletic directors are asking for some relief from sports sponsorship minimums, and that means cutting some sports programs (Cincinnati just cut men’s soccer) will also be on the table as a cost-cutting measure, which is predictable but unfortunate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is always a push for more teams in the College Football Playoff. I don’t necessarily hate the idea, provided we don’t lose our minds and make it too big.</p>
<p>The maximum number of teams in College Football Playoff should be eight. That&nbsp;includes everyone that needs to be included and doesn’t include a bunch of teams who don’t deserve to be there. That could include the champions of the Power Five conferences, the highest ranked Group of Five team and two wild cards. Anything more than that is just excessive and waters down the playoff.</p>
<p>Some people want the College Football Playoff to become college basketball’s NCAA tournament, where everyone with a pulse seems to earn a bid. That’s not what a championship playoff should be about.</p>
<p>I have often said that when it comes to determining a national champion, the college football system is far superior to the college basketball system.&nbsp;That’s because in the football system, you can argue a case for a few teams that maybe could have been included, but you cannot make an argument that the four teams who were selected didn’t deserve to be there. If you are one of the four teams in the playoff,&nbsp; you have had an elite season by any measure. And the playoff should be a reward for teams that have an elite season.</p>
<p>The college basketball system of taking 68 teams is fun for people who want to fill out brackets. It has essentially created two holidays for people to skip out of work at noon and watch basketball all day long. But it also means a whole lot of mediocre teams get a chance to compete for the national championship, and that is silly.</p>
<p>That’s my biggest fear if you include too many teams in College Football Playoff. There are not 16 teams worthy of competing for the national championship every season. There aren’t even 12, and some years I think eight is probably a stretch.</p>
<p>Take this past season as an example as what an eight-team playoff versus a 16-team playoff would be. The eight-team one (using my suggestion above) would have been LSU (SEC), Ohio State (Big Ten), Clemson (ACC), Oklahoma (Big 12), Oregon (Pac 12), Memphis (Group of Five), Georgia (wild card 1) and Baylor (wild card 2). Those eight teams had a combined total of eight losses (prior to the bowls), which means it was an elite field, even though Memphis was ranked 17th.</p>
<p>That is more than enough to make sure that everyone who deserves to be included is included. If you go to 16, you then have to start getting into two- and even three-loss teams and at that point it makes the whole thing seem kind of like a farce.</p>
<p>I understand the need to expand and the need in these times to try and generate revenue.&nbsp;But any more than eight teams is unnecessary.</p>
