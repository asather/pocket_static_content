<h1>Pitt's chancellor on black community : 'We let them down.'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police, University of Pittsburgh Chancellor Patrick Gallagher says initial shock at&nbsp;“another case of unbelievable police brutality” shifted to reflection about what he and Pitt have done to combat racism.</p>
<p>What he learned made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>On Thursday, in extraordinarily candid remarks to faculty leaders, Mr. Gallagher outlined a broad effort to rethink inclusivity and social justice at Western Pennsylvania’s largest university — a place he said holds itself up as a beacon of hope but in some respects has not lived up to the aspiration.</p>
<p>Areas being looked at range from re-examining the name of Pitt’s medical school building and possibly creating a required course on black studies to greater police diversity training and additional faculty and staff support for black student organizations that address community inequities.</p>
<p>He said a committee will be formed to re-examine the name of the building housing Pitt’s medical school, Scaife Hall, and if complaints that it has links to racism are warranted, he is willing to forward a recommendation to trustees to remove it.</p>
<p>In 2018, Pitt trustees <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2018/06/29/Pitt-removes-Thomas-Parran-Jr-name-Parran-Hall-Tuskegee-study-Guatemala-experiments/stories/201806290094" target="_blank">removed the name </a>of the university’s Graduate School of Public Health building given that Thomas Parran Jr., the former dean for whom it was named half a century earlier, was linked to the infamous Tuskegee experiments on African American men.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nationally, similar efforts to remove vestiges of racism have touched various arenas amid the Black Lives Matter movement, including higher education. This week, Louisiana State University announced that it plans to strip from its library the name of a former president tied to segregation.</p>
<p>During Thursday’s University Senate council meeting, Mr. Gallagher said his discussions with black students in recent days as well as employees brought home that — even before Mr. Floyd’s dead last month and the national reckoning that followed — the university was not&nbsp;conveying what those students and faculty needed.</p>
<p>He described that as collegiality, but also friendship. It should be part of their experience on campus and in the city, he said.</p>
<p>“One of the most painful things is the degree to which we let them down ... that their experience didn’t live up to the ideals that we uphold at the university, whether it was in explicit ways or implicit ways,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Floyd’s death last month has sparked national and international calls for police reforms, but it also has been highly personal and is “possibly one of the biggest moments I’ve lived through,” Mr. Gallagher said. It’s made him re-examine his own role.</p>
<p>“Have I been an instrument for oppression or anti-racism?” he said.&nbsp;“That’s happening for everybody.”</p>
<p>“We love to talk about Pitt and this shiny university on the hill that has changed Pittsburgh for the better and has been an angel of opportunity,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the revitalization enjoyed by much of the city has not happened in black communities&nbsp;“within the shadow of the Cathedral of Learning,” he said.</p>
<p>The 10-story Scaife Hall, which opened in 1955, is named for Alan Magee Scaife, according to&nbsp;“Pitt: The History of the University of Pittsburgh 1787 to 1987.’’ In his book, Robert C. Alberts writes that Mr. Scaife’s wife, Sarah Mellon Scaife, raised the first spade in 1954 for a building that would later carry her husband’s name.</p>
<p>“There have been allegations that either the person for whom it was named or was responsible for the naming was involved in eugenics activities and this was a problem,” Mr Gallagher said.&nbsp;Eugenics is the controversial study of ways to selectively breed humans to promote superior traits and to discourage reproduction of those with perceived flaws.</p>
<p>The Pitt-published University Times on Friday noted that Mr. Scaife’s daughter, Cordelia Scaife May, was associated with anti-immigration policies.</p>
<p>Pitt’s strategic planning process, now on hold, will be amended to more explicitly state action and measurable five-year goals to promote not just equity and inclusion but social justice, Mr. Gallagher said.</p>
<p>“Is the goal broad enough? Specific enough?”&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s about accountability and “getting to some of those harder, more uncomfortable questions,” he said.</p>
<p>“You don’t make change by focusing on the parts of the story you already know or that you want to believe in. You do it by putting up a mirror in front of yourself, and in our case our own organization, to see how we can be better,” he said.</p>
<p>He said ideas are still being developed, but noted that items already underway include:</p>
<p>— Adding faculty and staff support in a number of schools across Pitt for black student organizations whose members may feel they have been neglected, among them the <a href="https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/Student/Student-Programs/Excel/Overview/" target="_blank">Excel&nbsp;program</a> in the Swanson School of Engineering focused on recruiting, retention and graditional, in particular under represented groups;</p>
<p>— Working with the United Way of Western Pennsylvania to create an impact fund in the next annual university campaign to support groups and organization addressing barriers to success and discrimination;</p>
<p>— Additional diversity training for Pitt police, including areas specifically focused on African American studetns;</p>
<p>— Adding black representation to the chancellor’s advisory committee on public safety;</p>
<p>— Examining curriculum adjustments that could promote inclusion and understanding, including the possibility of a required course for all university students in black studies.</p>
