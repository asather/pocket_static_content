<h1>Clergy leaders deliver demands for police reform to Peduto, Fitzgerald</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Members of the Concerned Clergy of Western Pennsylvania gathered Monday at Freedom Corner to announce that they would be delivering a letter directly to Mayor Bill Peduto and County Executive Rich Fitzgerald demanding police reform and accountability.</p>
<p>A copy of the demands have also been sent to City Police Chief Scott Schubert.</p>
<p>“We’ve come together to continue to say that ‘enough is enough,’ ” the Rev. Richard Wingfield said.</p>
<p>In the letter, the group calls for the reallocation of a “substantial portion” of the Pittsburgh police department’s 2021 budget of over $114 million to be re-invested in six areas: public safety, education, transportation, housing, mental health and recreation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For public safety, the group calls for a task force to&nbsp;“explore alternative ways to respond to harm,” as well as sponsoring a violence intervention initiative that’s convened by clergy and community. It also calls for the creation of community-based violence prevention and interruption programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For education, the letter calls for strength-based programming to teach students the laws of public safety and cites a national program called the&nbsp;“Public Safety Cadets” that prepares young adults for careers and leadership in public safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For transportation, the letter calls for an increase in funding for neighborhood transportation services provided by community groups and increase funds for public transit in order to provide extended service and additional routes to urban and outlying communities.</p>
<p><em>Here is a copy of the letter:</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the letter demands an increase in investment in local mental health organizations and funding for 24-hour recreation centers with sports programs staffed by coaches and athletes, arts programs, libraries and other cultural centers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The letter did not specifically state how much money should go into each.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We didn’t list an amount or percentage,” Rev. Wingfield said. “What we’re saying is that you need to look at the whole system, and there’s things that need to be taken care of across the board. And whatever amount it takes, needs to be used.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rev. Wingfield also recognized how <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/15/Pittsburgh-groups-demands-police-reform/stories/202006150065" target="_blank">other activist groups have provided demands</a> to defund the police and fund black communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We applaud their efforts and honor their efforts, however we come as clergy to do our part to let city and county elected officials know that the clergy across Western Pennsylvania are just as concerned and involved as well,” Rev. Wingfield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After meeting with Mr. Peduto in his office, Rev. Wingfield said he thought it went well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re very pleased thus far,” Rev. Wingfield said.&nbsp;“And we will continue to follow up with that. He really recognized the fact that there are some issues that needed to be addressed in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Rev. Wingfield said the mayor specifically noted in the meeting the importance of investing in mental health and entrepreneurship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rev. Earlene Coleman, also present at the meeting, said she thought the mayor was&nbsp;“sincere” with their concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He was knowledgeable already about some of the concerns we raised,” Rev. Coleman said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while Mr. Peduto told the group that a task force has been put together to address concerns, Rev. Wingfield said he hopes to hear back from him in 10 days with a clear idea of action.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald was not available when the group arrived at his office on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
