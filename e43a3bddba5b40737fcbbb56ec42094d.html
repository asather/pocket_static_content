<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: How creative should pro sports get upon their return? </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lenny Randle and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt Saylor, @matt_saylor:</strong> Here’s an off the wall idea for playoff hockey overtime... 1st OT 5-on-5, 2nd OT 4-on-4, 3rd OT and any subsequent OTs 3-on-3. Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Hello, Dr. Saylor. You’re not crazy. About the only good to come from the sports-world stoppage is the out-of-the-box thinking it has spawned.</p>
<p>However, I’d rather see 4-on-4 the whole time in playoff overtime — and before anybody gives me the “Oh my God, how can you defile my pure and precious sport like that?” let me ask: Are we talking about the same sport that decides regular-season games with 3-on-3 overtimes (which I love) and breakaway contests (which I also love)?</p>
<p>Are we talking about the same sport where sensitive skin gets you an extra two minutes on the power play (you know, drawing blood, which might the single most ridiculous rule in all of sports).</p>
<p>Point being, let’s not get too haughty over hockey. If your playoff field is going to be decided at least partially on who does best in 3-on-3 hockey, why would it be so blasphemous to decide a playoff game in 4-on-4?</p>
<p>By the way, I’m also in favor of larger nets and going 3-on-3 for the first or second 10 minutes of the second period of every regular-season game. Home team decides which 10. It would be incredible. It would be no more a defilement of the game than slapping a minor on a guy who accidentally puts the puck over the glass.</p>
<p>I could go on here.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Dee, @JDeePGH:</strong> If you had to be quarantined with any local sports media personality, who would it be and why?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Mullsy, because I know what I’m getting. I was quarantined with him for six years.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Mueller. @ChrisMuellerPGH:</strong> The KBO (go Kiwoom Heroes) allows ties, even in the postseason. Should MLB explore this?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Speak of the devil.</p>
<p>Yes, Mullsy, and I am touched by you reaching out by way of old-school mailbag. You can also contact me via Poni Express. Get it?</p>
<p>MLB should explore all kinds of creative changes, not just this year but in years ahead. Better than a tie, however, would be a home-run hitting contest to decide the matter. I’m dead serious. How would that be any more impious (do you like that word, Mullsy?) than a hockey game decided by a breakaway contest (and I love shootouts) or a possible football rule where a team — after scoring — automatically retains the ball with a fourth-and-15 at its 25?</p>
<p>Sports should be fun. Now more than ever. This is a chance for some creative, intelligent thought across the landscape. But I also have no problem with a tie, especially if you’re trying to squeeze in tons of games in a shortened season.</p>
<p><strong>not a pirate, @RevD98:</strong> Jordan, LeBbron, Kobe......who’s the next young guy to dominate his generation.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Did you miss Steph Curry, Mr. not a pirate? All he did was win three NBA championships, two MVP awards and a scoring title and completely change the game from youth levels on up.</p>
<p>Having said that, he isn’t quite to the level of Jordan, LeBron or Kobe. I will acknowledge that. I suppose what you’re asking is, who comes after LeBron?</p>
<p>My answer: Nobody, yet. I don’t have an answer. Kevin Durant is an all-time great scorer but hardly a cultural icon. Giannis Antetokounmpo is unlike anything we’ve seen, but he needs to win a championship or three. James Harden hasn’t won. Kawhi Leonard might be the best player in the league, but his Q rating — fair or not — is nowhere near Magic, Michael, Kobe, LeBron levels.</p>
<p>Anyway, my All-Time NBA team, with old-school positions:</p>
<p>Point guard: Magic Johnson</p>
<p>Shooting guard: Michael Jordan</p>
<p>Small forward: LeBron James</p>
<p>Power forward: Bill Russell</p>
<p>Center: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</p>
<p>Sixth man: Larry Bird</p>
<p>All 2010s team:</p>
<p>Point guard: LeBron James (Let’s just say I’m comfortable with the ball in his hands)</p>
<p>Shooting guard: Steph Curry</p>
<p>Small forward: Kawhi Leonard</p>
<p>Power forward: Giannis Antetokounmpo (he can play anywhere)</p>
<p>Center: Anthony Davis</p>
<p>Sixth man: Kevin Durant</p>
<p>Why no James Harden, you ask?</p>
<p>Because I want LeBron James, Steph Curry and Kawhi Leonard to touch the ball, too.</p>
<p>I would, however, like to apologize to Russell Westbrook. I love the way he plays. No “load management” for this guy, which makes me want to take him over Kawhi, come to think of it. Westbrook plays every second like its a championship-clinching game — but until he actually wins one of those, I can’t pick him.</p>
<p><strong>Stu Ohler, @s_ohler:</strong> Which is the best neighborhood pick up sport: baseball (Wiffle or tennis), basketball, football or hockey (street or pond)?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Without question, it’s street hockey, Dr. Ohler.</p>
<p>We used to have a 2-on-2 league in Snyder, N.Y. (suburb of Buffalo). We wore shin guards in goal (all the better to make sliding saves), painted our goalie masks and of course enacted the ritual of shaping plastic stick-blades over a steaming pot of water.</p>
<p>We also had the perfect “rink” on a dead-end road shown in the photo that accompanies this answer. My teammate Ray Staff — we would watch Hockey Night in Canada on many a Saturday as we were playing “Battling Tops” — sent this to me out of the blue a few weeks ago. We still treasure that 2-on-2 league 40 years later.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph Grabowski, @ctbno1:</strong> Pitt football just picked up another three-star signing. Really starting to feel a momentum with the program. Hopefully same with Jeffress for [basketball]. School rep on the rise, Heather Lyke, coaches Capel and Narduzzi, providing stability. All lead better days ahead. Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Encouraged at the moment, Ralph. The QB recruit from Texas, Nate Yarnell, seems like a player on the rise. In the meantime, if there is a college football season, Pitt appears to have the kind of schedule and roster — certainly on defense — that could lead to a breakthrough season.</p>
<p>The question then becomes, how does one define “breakthrough season?”</p>
<p>I would define it as a Coastal Division title combined with an overall excellent year, meaning 10-2 in the regular season. I truly believe that is the bar.</p>
<p>As for basketball, the William Jeffress signing was a huge step forward for Jeff Capel. That is Pitt’s highest-rated recruit since Steven Adams, and there is additional size and skill coming into the program.</p>
<p>So yes, the ingredients are coming together. Now we’ll see if the cooks (Capel, Narduzzi) can whip up something special.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Zemba, @CraigZemba:</strong> Is Belichick really running with the current QBs he has on the roster this season? If so, is he taking aim now for Trevor Lawrence in next year’s draft?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> He’s not tanking for Trevor, Craig, but there is also nothing about New England’s offseason that tells me Belichick is in win-now mode. I think he knows they can’t win it all this season (if there is a season), and I think he is willing to take a step back in order to reload for 2021.</p>
<p>The Patriots traded out of the first round. They lost several key defensive players. Their quarterback’s gone. They could go 9-7 and make the playoffs, sure, but the big reload will come in 2021. And I still find it hard to believe Jarrett Stidham is his guy for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Donald Hilenbrant, @Hildebeest24:</strong> Do you like chess, Joseph Starkey?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I hate chess, Donald Hilenbrant. My brain doesn’t work in chess dimensions. I have never won a chess match — I would estimate my career record at 0-8 — even though I invariably believe I’m going to win halfway through each one. It’s like I’m playing checkers and my opponent is playing … chess.</p>
<p>Also, I’m constantly surprised at the moves that precipitate my demise. Never saw it comin’, every time.</p>
<p>I will never play chess again.</p>
<p>I also hate checkers.</p>
