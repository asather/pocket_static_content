<h1>Jeff Banister among Pirates’ 15 layoffs in baseball operations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Longtime Pirate Jeff Banister was among the club’s 15 layoffs Friday, as they restructured their baseball operations department under new general manager Ben Cherington.</p>
<p>Banister rejoined the Pirates as a special assistant in January 2019. Before he spent four years managing the Texas Rangers, Banister spent 29 years in the Pirates organization, in a variety of roles.</p>
<p>Banister worked in player development and was a finalist for the managerial job that ultimately went to Clint Hurdle in 2010. He was Hurdle’s bench coach until 2014.</p>
<p>It was thought that Banister might replace Hurdle after the 2019 season, and he participated in the first round of interviews; however, after former GM Neal Huntington was fired, Banister was not among the final candidates.</p>
<p>Banister went 325-313 with the Rangers and won back-to-back AL West titles in 2013-14. He interviewed with the Houston Astros this past offseason to potentially succeed A.J. Hinch, though the job ultimately went to Dusty Baker.</p>
<p>With the Pirates, Banister also served as a minor league manager and field coordinator at the major and minor league levels.</p>
<p>The Pirates drafted Banister in the 25th round of the 1986 draft. He got one major league at-bat, pinch-hitting for Doug Drabek and singling off Dan Petry at Three Rivers Stadium.</p>
