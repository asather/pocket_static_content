<h1>Partisan fight over slowed mail delivery raises worries ahead of 2020 election</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The report released Wednesday by Sen. Bob Casey’s office contained serious findings: The average delivery time for drug orders to pharmacies increased by 18% to 32% this summer, delaying medications and hiking shipment costs by as much as $700,000 for one health provider during July.</p>
<p>“This report shows what we have feared all along,” Mr. Casey stated. Recent organizational changes at the U.S. Postal Service had caused “real, potentially life threatening, consequences for people.”</p>
<p>In an interview about an hour after the report was released, Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters, dismissed Democrats’ concerns about the U.S. Postal Service as an attempt to confuse Americans and doubled down on his claim that such worries were a “conspiracy theory.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They’re not even close to running out of money,” Mr. Reschenthaler said, pointing out the U.S. Postal Service has $14 billion in cash on hand as of June 30. “This is a completely manufactured crisis.”</p>
<p>Two months before Election Day, the partisan fight over the U.S. Postal Service continues to split Democrats and Republicans in Pennsylvania and beyond.</p>
<p>The starkly divergent views on Capitol Hill on the performance of mail delivery has cast a shadow over the looming presidential election in November, when millions of Pennsylvanians are expected to cast their vote by mail amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Democrats have expressed alarm at changes imposed by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. A memo in July outlined Mr. DeJoy’s changes that, citing a need to trim costs, prohibited overtime pay, shut down sorting machines early and required letter carriers to leave mail behind when necessary to avoid extra trips or late delivery on routes.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked the Postal Service,&nbsp;calling the agency “a joke” and demanded it raise package rates by 400% before he would approve any funding. In August,&nbsp;Mr. Trump told Fox News he wanted to block funding because he opposed mail-in voting, claiming there would be widespread fraud.</p>
<p>The Postal Service has removed hundreds of mail-sorting machines, and mail had been delayed recently in Western Pennsylvania, a union official told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month.</p>
<p>Mr. DeJoy, facing pressure from lawmakers, pledged to halt any more changes to mail delivery operations. But he has declined to bring back machines that have already been removed.</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Casey joined 10 U.S. House members from Pennsylvania in asking the postmaster general to immediately return 30 letter-sorting machines that have been removed from Pennsylvania mail facilities. The letter was signed by all&nbsp;nine members of the state’s Democratic delegation and one Pennsylvania Republican, U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Bucks, who faces a re-election battle.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, Mr. Casey’s office had received 108,917 letters on the U.S. Postal Service from constituents since Mr. DeJoy’s policies went into effect on July 14, according to a spokesperson. Since Mr. Trump’s Fox News interview on Aug. 13, the office has received 67,310 letters from all 67 counties in Pennsylvania and 2,580 calls in support of the Postal Service, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Mr. Reschenthaler — pressed on whether the removal of mail-sorting machines had not happened or mail delivery had not slowed — said he was not aware of any issues.</p>
<p>“I’ve not to my knowledge had any constituent reach out and complain” about slowed mail delivery, Mr. Reschenthaler said, adding, “I’m super suspect on the timing” of Democrats’ reports.</p>
<p>“You have individuals trying to undermine confidence in the U.S. Postal Service right before an election where you’re going to have a very large bloc of the American public voting by mail,” Mr. Reschenthaler said.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey, ranking member of the Senate Aging Committee, portrayed Wednesday’s report, released with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as quantifying mail delivery delays.</p>
<p>The two senators sent letters dated Aug. 19 to five major pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers that provide mail-order service: Cigna/Express Scripts, CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance, UnitedHealth/Optum and Humana.</p>
<p>They asked for prescriptions filled this year and the delivery times compared with the same period one year ago.&nbsp;More than 170 million prescriptions were filled by mail in 2019, and that number is poised to significantly rise during the pandemic.</p>
<p>All five companies responded, and the data showed mail delays and increased costs due to reshipment and shifting to other carriers, the senators reported.&nbsp;One company reported a “marked increase in July in the number of patients experiencing shipment delays of seven days or more.”</p>
<p>If&nbsp;the cost increases continue, they warned,&nbsp;consumers and taxpayers may be on the hook as the government buys prescription drugs under Medicare,&nbsp;Medicaid and other federal programs.</p>
<p>Only one of the five companies reported no unusual delays, but that company relied more on private shippers than the Postal Service.</p>
<p><strong>No ‘meddling’</strong></p>
<p>In interviews in recent weeks, Pennsylvania Republicans took the view that the Postal Service was operating just fine. They voted against a bill passed by the Democratically controlled House last month that would provide an additional $25 billion to the Postal Service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Throwing additional money at the problem is not the answer,” said Rep. John Joyce, R-Blair. “We need better evaluation and better implementation.”</p>
<p>Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Centre, called the bill&nbsp;“unnecessary” and pointed out the Postal Service operates independently from any taxpayer funding.&nbsp;“We shouldn’t be meddling with them right now,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Reschenthaler and Mr. Thompson said they would support lifting the mandate that the Postal Service pre-fund pensions of its employees — a major factor to heavy financial losses.</p>
<p>But mail volumes have been declining for years. Even with a bump in package delivery revenue during the pandemic, the Postal Service lost $2.2 billion from April to June, almost the same loss reported from April to June 2019.</p>
