<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation announced on Friday morning that slide remediation work on Forbes Road in Monroeville and Trafford will begin on Monday, July 27.</p>
<p>The announcement said that the road work, which begins at approximately 9 a.m. on Monday, will close Forbes road to traffic between Haymaker Road and Westmoreland Road/Stewart Station Drive through to mid-November.</p>
<p>Through traffic will be detoured via Route 130 (7th Street/Forest Avenue/Broadway Boulevard) through Trafford.</p>
<p>An official at PennDOT said that average daily traffic on the roadway is about 5,700 vehicles, but that traffic is still down due to COVID-19. PennDOT therefore does not expect any major traffic disruptions due to the reduced traffic volume and straightforward detour route.</p>
<p>The announcement also said that slide remediation, shoulder reconstruction, paving and other miscellaneous construction work will occur on the $1.34 million project.</p>
