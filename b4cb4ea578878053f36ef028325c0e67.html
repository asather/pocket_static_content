<h1>#ItsGoodToGive: Christine Biancheria</h1>

<p><em>#ItsGoodToGive is an occasional feature for the SEEN column that highlights people giving back in meaningful ways.</em></p>
<p>Given the chance to do something hard, something great and something that others may find impossible, would you do it? That was the question Christine Biancheria grappled with in 1993 after law school and a civil and human rights internship in Geneva, Switzerland. Ms. Biancheria had been assigned to an international commission of lawyers and judges who consulted for the United Nations. “That’s where I met Dilbur Parakh,” she said. That’s where the seed of transformation would be planted.</p>
<p>After returning from Switzerland, the Squirrel Hill woman and a partner opened a private practice focused on civil litigation and civil rights work in the areas of adoption and employee discrimination. “My heart was in public interest work, but litigation paid the bills,” she said. One restless afternoon, she decided to look up Ms.&nbsp;Parakh and see where she was. “I was blown away,” she said as she read about what Ms.&nbsp;Parakh was doing in Mumbai, India.</p>
<p>“She had left a very sought-after position in Geneva and had returned to India for her greater purpose. I realized this was how you make change. This was about values and taking action.” As she researched, she realized she, too, could make a lasting impact on the world. “I always felt overwhelmed by all the problems in the world. You don’t often get to see the impact, and I wanted to know I could help make a difference.”</p>
<p>In 2016, Ms. Biancheria’s law partner died, and she was at a crossroads. “That was rough, but I’m a firm believer that good comes from bad.” The first trip that Ms. Biancheria took was to visit her friend in India.</p>
<p>Ms.&nbsp;Parakh had begun the <a href="https://www.aseema.org/" target="_blank">Aseema Charitable Trust</a> in 1995. Aseema, whose name is a Sanskrit word for “limitless,” works to educate children living in extreme poverty in the slums and streets of Mumbai. Ms.&nbsp;Parakh told Ms. Biancheria that there were laws in place in India on children's rights and protections but implementing them was a problem.</p>
<p>“Dilbur said, ‘We have to do this ourselves,’” she recalled. “Most people would think it’s unsolvable. This organization takes children who are living in the worst circumstances and provides them with an education that is so all encompassing by focusing on their needs. These children are graduating and passing the tests at rates well above the rest of their region, including those attending private schools.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did it start? “It was a hard sell,” said Ms. Biancheria. “The people living in the slums are rightfully suspicious of outsiders. Aid organizations come and go, so there isn’t a lot of trust.” They began going into communities with social workers and local supporters. Eventually, they were able to borrow a room after hours in a school. Few of the first 20 students had ever held a pencil or sat at a desk. They were fascinated by electric lights. There was no focus.</p>
<p>The organization began educating itself on educational practices and decided to implement the Montessori method. That shift to principles espoused in the early 20th century by an Italian physician, Dr. Maria Montessori, was a game-changer. There are four schools currently serving 2,700 children ages 5-18. “We have alumni now. These kids are so altruistic. They come back from college to help the next in line. It’s truly amazing,”&nbsp;Ms. Biancheria said.</p>
<p>Back home, Ms. Biancheria decided to create the Pittsburgh-based <a href="https://friendsofaseema.org/" target="_blank">Friends of Aseema</a>, a foundation to help raise funds and awareness of the work being done in Mumbai. “I believe helping out locally is important, but when you give on a global level, it creates an oasis of hope,” she said.</p>
<p>“Cross those artificial lines in our minds and connect. The interconnectedness of the world ... that is the vision of hope. When raised in all-encompassing love and knowing you are valued, it helps increase altruism in the world. We need more of that.”</p>
