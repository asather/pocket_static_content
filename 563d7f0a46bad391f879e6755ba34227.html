<h1>Pirates mailbag: Which players are untouchable?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>This mailbag is being released on the day of Major League Baseball’s trade deadline.</em></p>
<p><em>What’s fun is that means we have plenty to talk about. What’s not so fun is that it means all of these answers could be rendered useless in less than 12 hours. Normally it takes twice that long!</em></p>

<p><strong>Brad (@Brad13____):&nbsp;</strong>How many trades do you think we’ll see the Pirates make this deadline?</p>
<p><strong>Mike Persak:&nbsp;</strong>The best answer I think I can give is not as many as I think people want. In addition to the trade that sent Jarrod Dyson to the White Sox, I think we see one, maybe two more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/08/30/Pirates-Ben-Cherington-trade-deadline-Jarrod-Dyson/stories/202008300173" target="_blank">Listening to Ben Cherington</a> speak Sunday on his weekly radio show, he didn’t sound like a man who was ready to sell off a ton of players as quickly as possible. He’s implied that before, too.</p>
<p>There were a whole flurry of moves Sunday, but none felt truly monumental, and the Pirates held pat. There’s been smoke around Trevor Williams, Chad Kuhl and Joe Musgrove, but Cherington is emphasizing that deals need to be correct for the Pirates to pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>Johnny (@johnnyswhere):&nbsp;</strong>Who on the roster/system is considered untouchable?&nbsp;Is there a guy in particular that Cherington really likes in the organization?</p>
<p><strong>Persak:&nbsp;</strong>Obviously, Cherington isn’t going to come out and trash anybody. What I think is more consequential here are the players who have gotten every opportunity so far this season.</p>
<p>For example, even before he turned into one of the Pirates’ best hitters, Erik Gonzalez got a lot of chances to prove himself early. Cherington has been extremely complimentary of him. On Sunday, he pointed to him as an example of a player who can improve with a fresh start or more opportunities.</p>
<p>We know from the past that Cherington and the Pirates cherish Josh Bell. They’ve put a lot of work into Cole Tucker’s outfield transition. That certainly counts for something. Bryan Reynolds and Kevin Newman almost surely aren’t going anywhere in the near, 24-hour future. (Note: This list isn’t exhaustive.)</p>
<p>Cherington also addressed trading fan favorites away last week and didn’t rule it out. That point is tangential to this question, but something to keep in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Raymond Arke (@Rarke8):&nbsp;</strong>With Gonzalez being one of the few highlights of the year so far, where does this leave Newman? Any chance one or the other will shift positions?</p>
<p><strong>Persak:&nbsp;</strong>I think Newman’s going to switch to second base at some point. If not for Gonzalez, then for Oneil Cruz or someone else in the future.</p>
<p>Newman has struggled at shortstop. Already this season, in 18 games, he is worth minus-2 defensive runs saved. At second base, in just five games, he has a positive defensive runs saved compared to the average MLB mark. That’s a small sample size, but it was also true last season.</p>
<p>For this to make sense, Frazier will have to leave. There were rumors he’d be traded last winter and again at this deadline, so it seems a safe bet that Frazier will be playing elsewhere in, at least, the relative near future.</p>
<p><strong>@SteeloCity:&nbsp;</strong>What do you think Bell’s future with the Pirates is?</p>
<p><strong>Persak:&nbsp;</strong>There is no part of me that believes the Pirates are going to cut bait soon. If things don’t turn around, I fear that arbitration next offseason could be strange for Bell, because of how large the gap between his highs and lows are.</p>
<p>To answer the question, I think the Pirates want to avoid that. I think they will pay him more than he might earn on the open market for next season. I think they will try to help him find his offensive spark again while in Pittsburgh over the next few seasons. Right now, I don’t see teams incredibly eager to drop a bag on Bell’s front porch. I don’t see them extending him prematurely, either. This one probably needs more time to have a feeling of how long, beyond the next few seasons, Bell could be in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Krieger (@Jovenator22):&nbsp;</strong>Do you see Jacob Stallings as a viable extension candidate?</p>
<p><strong>Persak:&nbsp;</strong>Stallings, the 30-year-old catcher, will enter his first season of arbitration eligibility this offseason. That sentence helps underscore how wild his development has been. He is currently the Pirates’ best all-around player in 2020. Using your time traveling device to tell yourself that fact one year ago would be a waste of resources, but it’s a fun thought exercise.</p>
<p>The nature of his contract, combined with his age, tells me the Pirates don’t have to worry about this quite yet. I don’t think he’s a candidate for it, though. Stallings at 30 is really solid. I don’t know how long he can make that last.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin (@gone_postin):&nbsp;</strong>Has there been any interesting feedback from players or coaches about the work being done at Altoona?</p>
<p><strong>Persak:&nbsp;</strong>Things seem kind of tough out there, but they’re making due. I imagine that’s the case for every alternate training site.</p>
<p>Basically, there aren’t enough position players to fill out a field for a full scrimmage. Even if there were, there wouldn’t be enough pitchers to have them all on the same schedule to fill nine innings. Like I said, kind of tough!</p>
<p>Cody Ponce mentioned when he first pitched with the Pirates that morale can sometimes get low in Altoona. That seems understandable. I think they’re doing the best with what they have. They should at least be commended in that a lot of the players the Pirates have called up have been ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>ethomp (@niceshirtbro):&nbsp;</strong>OK, I’ll bite. Is Kumar Rocker the far and away consensus No. 1 pick in the draft? Trying to decide if my constant rooting for the Bucs to be competitive but lose is worth it?!?</p>
<p><strong>Persak:&nbsp;</strong>Ah, the apple of everyone’s eye. Vanderbilt right-hander Kumar Rocker is the consensus best player in the 2021 MLB draft. I have not seen that waver at all. So, yes, the very presence of consensus tells me he is far and away the favorite for first overall.</p>
<p>I have seen his teammate, right-hander Jack Leiter, mentioned as a potential competitor but not nearly enough for me to consider it a possibility just yet. Really, it’s hard for me to consider 2021 at all right now. The world is a strange place. Other than Rocker, of course. He’s the best.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Varley (@</strong><strong>kvarley13):&nbsp;</strong>Pull out your crystal ball. Pirates starting nine opening day 2022? Not asking much I know...</p>
<p><strong>Persak: </strong>I’m not hard to find. You can yell at me if you think I’m dumb:</p>
<p>C: Jacob Stallings</p>
<p>1B: Josh Bell</p>
<p>2B: Kevin Newman</p>
<p>SS: Oneil Cruz</p>
<p>3B: Ke’Bryan Hayes</p>
<p>LF: Bryan Reynolds</p>
<p>CF: Travis Swaggerty</p>
<p>RF: Cole Tucker</p>
<p>P: That’s right. It’s Kumar Rocker. No it isn’t. It’s Jameson Taillon.</p>
