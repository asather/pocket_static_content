<h1>Wiz Khalifa will launch Genius Live series with free concert Thursday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Genius —&nbsp;a leading source for music lyrics online — is launching a new concert platform, Genius Live, that will begin with Wiz Khalifa at 9 p.m. Thursday.</p>
<p>While the concert streams for free at <a href="https://live.genius.com/" target="_blank">live.genius.com</a>, fans will be able to vote on which songs make the setlist, leave a tip, chat with each other and, for a fee, receive a personal shoutout or go ‘on stage’ with the Pittsburgh rap star.</p>
<p>The concert will be simulcast on YouTube Live, Instagram Live, Facebook Live, and Twitch, but the interactions between Khalifa and fans will happen exclusively on Genius Live.</p>
<p>By Khalifa’s choice, all proceeds raised during the concert will go to The Black Political Empowerment Project (B-PEP), a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit dedicated to encouraging the city’s African-American community to vote.</p>
<p>The show will be hosted by Genius’ Rob Markman and feature a pre-show DJ set by S.WHiT.</p>
<p>Here are the fees to participate:</p>
<p>Vote on the setlist: Free</p>
<p>Join the watch party: $10</p>
<p>Ask for a shoutout: $100</p>
<p>Ask a question: $200</p>
<p>Genius co-founder and CEO Tom Lehman said in a statement, “From day one, Genius has built new ways for artists and fans to interact, always with a shared love for music knowledge at the center, and Genius Live will carry that sensibility to the virtual live performance space. Artists make most of their revenue from touring and live performances, and with in-person concerts mostly paused and the industry quickly evolving, we want to provide a unique experience that empowers artists to leverage this revenue stream from anywhere in the world—certainly at this moment, but also beyond. To launch Genius Live with Wiz Khalifa, who has generously chosen to donate all proceeds from this inaugural event to B-PEP in his hometown of Pittsburgh, is a total dream. He’s a singular talent who has always shared a close connection with his fans.”</p>
