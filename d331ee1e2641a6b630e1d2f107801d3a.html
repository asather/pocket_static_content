<h1>Meet Andrew McCutchen's alter ego, 'Uncle Larry'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It turns out laughs weren’t the only thing Philadelphia radio and television personality Howard Eskin generated when he completely whiffed in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/02/12/andrew-mccutchen-phillies-spring-training-2020-howard-eskin/stories/202002120135" target="_blank">identifying Andrew McCutchen</a> back in February, referring to him in a tweet as “Lawrence McCutcheon.”</p>
<p>Nope. His post has become the inspiration for an entire alter ego the former National League MVP and current Phillies outfielder has been workshopping social media during these months of pandemic lockdown.</p>
<p>“Uncle Larry,” as he’s called, has become a consistent presence on the former Pirate’s Twitter profile, starring in a number of goofy short video clips poking fun at the incident. Here’s a sampling.</p>
<p>Now Uncle Larry is making his way onto the field. With the Phillies once again training for the 2020 season, McCutchen appeared on the Citizens Bank Park turf Tuesday sporting a shirt that pays homage to the gruff elder version of himself.</p>
<p>The nom de plume represents fun McCutchen wasn’t able to have much of last season, when he tore his ACL in June and missed the rest of the year.&nbsp;Recovery for the originally scheduled start of 2020 was uncertain. He was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/06/andrew-mccutchen-injury-update-acl-philadelphia-phillies/stories/202004060076" target="_blank">ruled out for Opening Day</a> but had hoped to be back by April.</p>
<p>Now it’s July, more than a year since the injury took him down, and things are looking up. Phillies general manager Matt Klentak told reporters last week that he <a href="https://www.nj.com/phillies/2020/06/phillies-gm-prepares-for-spring-training-20-admits-safety-will-be-a-challenge.html" target="_blank">expects McCutchen to be ready</a> when his team begins its season July 24 at home against Miami.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old will start the season with a cool-as-heck baseball card in distribution, too. Topps debuted it late last month, and he’s looking pretty fly in those cool ’80s era Phillies threads.</p>
<p>Now that’s something even Uncle Larry can get excited about.</p>
