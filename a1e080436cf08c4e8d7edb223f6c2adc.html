<h1>Mylan donating 10 million doses of malaria drug for experimental COVID-19 treatment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Generic drug maker Mylan said Wednesday it was donating 10 million tablets of the malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine sulfate to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for possible use in clinical studies or in emergencies as a treatment for COVID-19 infections.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration is permitting the emergency use of the medication supplied from the strategic national stockpile for experimental treatment in patients hospitalized with the novel coronavirus for whom a clinical trial is not available, or participation is not feasible, Mylan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company, which is run from executive offices in Cecil, also said it was donating product to the World Health Organization to support the investigation of the potential effectiveness of several medicines in treating COVID-19.</p>
<p>Additional shipments to wholesalers in the U.S. also are underway, Mylan said.</p>
<p>Mylan announced March 19 that it had restarted production of generic hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets at its Morgantown, W.Va., plant to meet increasing demand.</p>
<p>Beside malaria, the medication is used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Some patients with those diseases have reported having trouble filling their prescriptions in recent weeks because of shortages because of interest in the drug as a possible treatment for COVID-19.</p>
