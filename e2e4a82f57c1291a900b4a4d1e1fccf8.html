<h1>Clarion University's fall semester will go online</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Clarion University on Wednesday became the sixth of Pennsylvania's 14 state-owned universities to announce it has reversed course and will take the fall semester largely online in light of concerns about escalating COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>“This approach will decrease the population density on campus and ensure academic continuity for students by removing the possibility of a switch to remote learning later in the semester, should conditions warrant it,” the school said in a statement.</p>
<p>The school joins Edinboro, West Chester, East Stroudsburg, Millersville and Lock Haven universities that in recent days have made a similar decision.</p>
<p>"As a committee continued to monitor news about COVID-19, they determined the safest course of action is to move the majority of classes to remote delivery for fall 2020,” said Clarion President President Dale-Elizabeth Pehrsso.</p>
<p>Schools that have moved online have raised concerns ranging from lack of available testing to difficulty enforcing social distancing in residence halls, and off campus. There are also concerns about the unpredictability of surges in the virus that has seen hot spots appear in some 40 states, a number of which send students to Clarion and other Pennsylvania campuses.</p>
