<h1>Penguins mailbag: What's the next move after the Kasperi Kapanen trade?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome back to Mike’s Mailbag. The Penguins’ postseason run may have ended after just four games, but general manager Jim Rutherford is giving us plenty to talk about.</em></p>
<p><em>This week, he orchestrated a significant, multi-player trade. There are a number of accessory elements to the deal, but here are the meat and potatoes: speedy, 24-year-old right winger Kasperi Kapanen is coming to Pittsburgh. In exchange, Toronto will get the Penguins’ first-round pick in 2020 (15th overall) and forward prospect Filip Hallander.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s dive into the deal and what else the Penguins might do during a busy offseason.</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> What is your opinion of the Kapanen trade? A first-round pick seems like a lot to give up.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>First, I agree with the decision to give up picks and prospects in order to win now. Sidney Crosby is 33 and Evgeni Malkin is 34. The window is either closing or closed. The only way to keep it propped open is to get a player who can help right now, not in four or five years. Sure, with that first-round pick, maybe the Penguins had a winning lottery ticket that went uncashed. But I would caution everyone not to overvalue the potential of the pick. Alex Galchenyuk was a third overall pick in 2012 who is still trying to find his place in the league. Fan favorite Jack Johnson was another.</p>
<p>Then, when it comes to the player, Kapanen seems like a good fit. He’s young, fast, can kill penalties and will bring a bit of an edge to a team that needs one. His addition — coupled with the Jason Zucker trade — solidifies the top-six. The Penguins believe they have two right wingers in Kapanen and Bryan Rust, two centers in Crosby and Malkin and two left wingers in Jake Guentzel and Zucker. A lot of teams in the league would be signing up for that top-six.</p>
<p>So I like the philosophy. I like the player. But my one concern is I wonder if the Penguins could have received more in return or could have pried Kapanen from Toronto for less.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kapanen said himself that he went through a “sophomore slump” last year, scoring just 13 goals. For reference, Jared McCann scored 14 and was a healthy scratch in the postseason. (But then again, Nico Hischier scored 14 and was the first overall pick in 2017.) The club is banking on the fact that when Kapanen gets elevated into a regular top-six role, that production will take off. It’s going to need to for this trade to pay off.</p>
<p><strong>Rich:</strong> What other moves can you picture the Penguins making after this deal?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> With Kapanen in the fold, the Penguins believe they have solidified their top-six. To me, there are a few clear areas that will need to be addressed this offseason: goaltending, a third-line center and a right-shot defenseman.</p>
<p>Rutherford is on the record saying the Penguins will need to deal either Matt Murray or Tristan Jarry in order to stay under the $81.5 million flat salary cap. Murray seems like the most likely candidate there, given he’ll command more money. But I guess technically both restricted free agents could be on the trading block.</p>
<p>The third-line center has been a constant issue for years now. McCann had his shot at it in the postseason but ended up becoming a healthy scratch in the playoffs. Nick Bjugstad, who had core muscle surgery and spinal surgery this year, would be another option. It seems he’ll either have that chance or become part of the compensation that helps the Penguins bring in a new candidate.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d expect changes on the blue line. Coming into this season, odds were against the Penguins re-signing Justin Schultz, given their salary cap situation. After an injury-plagued regular season and a rough postseason, it feels like Schultz is as good as gone as an unrestricted free agent. Chad Ruhwedel is next on the depth chart. But if the Penguins want to upgrade their roster, they’ll need a better right-shot blue liner in their regular rotation.</p>
<p><strong>Katie:</strong> If Matt Murray gets traded in the near future, where do you see him going? What kind of return do you think we’ll get for him?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Had the Penguins dealt Murray before this season, a first-round pick — or more — would have likely been the compensation. But after a rough start to this season and a postseason that was average, at best, I’m thinking more in the range of a second or maybe more likely third-round pick. Because Murray is a restricted free agent, whichever team that lands Murray will have to negotiate a long-term deal. That hurts his value, too.</p>
<p>Maybe Murray for a third-line center and a defenseman would help fill the holes and solve salary cap issues?</p>
<p>In terms of where he could go, a lot of teams could use a goalie. Chicago, Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary were all playoff teams that could shore up their goaltending situations. San Jose, Ottawa and Detroit are three that missed the 24-team tournament. If they believe in Murray, they could rebuild around him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though I don’t know how realistic it is, my favorite possibility to imagine is Murray going to Vegas. Marc-Andre Fleury lost the net to Robin Lehner. With Lehner headed for unrestricted free agency and Fleury clearly unhappy with his role, maybe there’s a significant shakeup at that position out in the desert. It’s fun to imagine, even if it might not be the most likely outcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> I really like Murray but do you think a change of scenery might be the best thing for him personally?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> When I think of the Penguins goalie situation, I’m reminded of this phrase: You never want to replace the guy. You want to replace the guy who <em>tries</em> to replace the guy.</p>
<p>It seems there’s a segment of the fanbase that looks back nostalgically at Fleury’s time in Pittsburgh. They sometimes forget the postseasons during which he struggled and the fact that he was not very good his last season here. To that group, no matter what Murray did — even winning two Cups — they were always going to focus on the negative.</p>
<p>The moment that sums that up, to me, came this season when Murray received Bronx cheers after a rough start against the Bruins. Murray took the high road after the game, giving a “no comment” response when asked about it. But the moment spoke volumes.</p>
<p>Look, Murray was bad in November and December. He played one great game in the playoffs, one bad one and one average. While no one should forget what he did for the Penguins, maybe going to a new city would be best for everyone involved.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> How hot is the seat under Mike Sullivan? And given how out of sync the coach and GM are with each other and the players, can there be a fix to make the Penguins competitive again?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I wouldn’t necessarily say Sullivan and Rutherford are out of sync. I would have agreed a few years ago when Rutherford started bringing in bigger bodies like Ryan Reaves that didn’t fit the speed game Sullivan wanted to play. But recently, the Penguins have doubled down on the speed-based approach. Brandon Tanev is one of the fastest players in the game. Zucker, too. And Kapanen.</p>
<p>With that said, it seems Rutherford is giving Sullivan what he wants. Now it’s time to do it.</p>
<p>By firing three respected assistants —&nbsp;Sergei Gonchar, Jacques Martin and Mark Recchi — Rutherford sent a pretty clear message. That’s basically as close as you can get to firing the head coach without actually pulling the trigger The pressure is surely on Sullivan to win early next year.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Am I the only one who can’t perceive any possible way NHL hockey can come back for any type of “regular season” play in any shape or form due to COVID concerns?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>That’s a good question. The NHL said its hope is to restart the 2020-21 season in December. Will the world be dramatically different by then? Probably not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One report from John Shannon said that the NHLPA and the NHL have discussed creating four bubble cities and rotating all 31 teams in those venues in eight-game increments. The issues would be getting players to agree to more time away from home and owners to agree to forgo more ticket revenue. I’m sure we’ll see about 65 other proposals before we get a concrete answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yankees Fan:</strong> Do you think the Pens will move or buy-out Jack Johnson this offseason?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Any time Rutherford is asked about Johnson, he backs the blue liner. Why? I can think of three possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does he simply believe in Johnson and feel he’s a capable third-pairing defenseman, even if the “advanced metrics” aren’t so kind? Is that because he knows it will be hard to unload a 33-year-old who is signed through 2022-23 on a deal that carries a $3.25 average annual value, especially with every team struggling to stay under a flat salary cap? Or is it because he doesn’t want to devalue an asset before he moves it?</p>
<p>I guess we’ll find out this offseason.</p>
