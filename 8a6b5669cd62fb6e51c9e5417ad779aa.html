<h1>Gov. DeWine gives reopening dates for Ohio’s day cares, gyms and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio parents looking to return to work received long-awaited word on Thursday that child day-care centers and day camps may reopen on May 31 but with fewer children and strict health monitoring.</p>
<p>That means some parents may find there’s no longer room for their children at centers facing tighter restrictions.</p>
<p>Bureau of Motor Vehicle offices may reopen on May 26 as may gyms, recreation and fitness centers, dance studios, tennis clubs, and similar entities. On that date sports leagues for low or no-contact sports like softball and tennis may resume, but availability of indoor gymnasiums and other school facilities for that use remains up in the air.</p>

<p>Publicly regulated pools may also open on May 26, but amusement and water parks have not been given the green light yet.</p>
<p>Campgrounds that have been operating on a more limited basis may more fully open on May 21. Horse racing is expected to return on May 22, but there will be no spectators. Also, don’t expect to return right now to the slots parlors attached to the racetracks, let alone to the state’s larger casinos.</p>
<p>But even as the state moves toward greater economic and personal activities, the coronavirus numbers being monitored by Gov. Mike DeWine and state health department director Amy Acton moved in the wrong direction Thursday.</p>
<p>New coronavirus infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and intensive-care unit stays climbed over the previous 24 hours, exceeding the average daily increases seen over the last 21 days for those metrics.</p>
<p>New infections climbed by 636, well above the daily average of 555, for a new total of 26,357. Deaths rose by 51 to a total of 1,534 in the state, compared with the daily average of 42. Hospitalizations increased by 100 and ICU stays by 20.</p>
<p>Lucas County also saw coronavirus numbers increase on Thursday. Overall cases rose modestly to 1,889 from 1,844, but deaths saw one of the largest single-day jumps since the pandemic began, with 182 deaths recorded as of Thursday compared to 167 the day before.</p>
<p>“As we open up and see more activity, it’s just incumbent upon us to be more careful,” Mr. DeWine said during a news briefing Thursday. “What we don’t want, frankly, is what we’ve seen. ... In Europe where they shut down, then they opened up, [and] now they have to retrench and start moving back again.”</p>
<p>The new rules for day-care centers will limit classroom sizes to no more than nine preschool and school-age children or six toddlers and infants.</p>
<p>Routine practices will include wearing face masks, taking temperatures of children as they arrive and sending them home if they are at 100 degrees or more, frequent hand=washing, and having children escorted into the building by an adult staffer rather than a parent.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to gamble ... on anyone in Ohio,” Dr. Acton said. “There’s nothing that we care about more than getting our citizens safely through what we’re all facing, which is a terrible virus.</p>
<p>“That means we’re all trying to live with it over the next year or two,” she said. “We know that part of opening in any way we do makes child care an absolutely essential piece of this.”</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine said the day-care centers reopening date was set after meetings with experts including pediatricians, children’s hospital representatives, child-care professionals, caregivers, parents, and infectious disease experts. But he said there is a shortage of good data having to do with children and this coronavirus.</p>
<p>Knowing the toll that the new restrictions will take on the bottom lines of day-care providers, Mr. DeWine announced than the state will use more than $60 million in federally approved funds to help them fill the financial gap.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what demand for day-care centers will be in the coronavirus era. With schools closed, many parents have been torn between returning to work and the lack of child care.</p>
<p>But Lt. Gov. Jon Husted noted that with unemployment running as high as it is, there may be fewer parents right now having to make that decision.</p>
<p>Restrictions will also be put in place for businesses like gyms, and state officials said that local public health departments and municipalities can enact their own restrictions, too.</p>
<p>While physical BMV locations will reopen, Mr. Husted strongly urged Ohioans whenever possible to use new online services to renew registrations, renew license plates, and update addresses rather than personally visit the BMV. A new law has extended the lives of current drivers’ licenses and registrations during this crisis without fear of being cited by police.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of new unemployment claims continued to drop, but still 51,125 Ohioans applied last week, according to the Department of Job and Family Services.</p>
<p>Over the last eight weeks, nearly 1.7 million Ohioans have filed claims, more than the last three years combined.</p>
<p>The state has distributed $2.4 billion in payments to date to 587,000 Ohioans and says it has processed 90 percent of all claims received. Claims can be filed at unemployment.ohio.gov.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Husted acknowledged the struggles that some Ohioans have had in getting through online or to the state’s beefed-up call center.</p>
<p>“I know that there are least 100,000 people who don’t have answers, that have qualified and they haven’t received money yet,” he said. “I know there are still people out there whose calls have not been heard. To them, I tell you we are building what we can with the technology we have and the resources we have. That’s not an excuse. It’s just an explanation.”</p>
<p>The state this week finally began processing claims under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Program, which provides claims for contract, self-employed, and part-time workers who are not usually eligible for unemployment compensation. Those claims may be filed at pua.unemployment.ohio.gov.</p>
<p>While Mr. DeWine and other top officials held near-daily 2 p.m. coronavirus briefings in the early days of the pandemic, that habit has started to taper off. The governor did not hold a briefing on Wednesday, for example, and as of Thursday evening he had not scheduled a briefing for Friday.</p>
