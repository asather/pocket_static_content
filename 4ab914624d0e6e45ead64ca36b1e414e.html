<h1>Peduto defends travel to D.C. that caused him to self-isolate</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto is defending his recent travel to Washington, D.C. —&nbsp; a trip that caused him to self-isolate for the past several days — saying that he had&nbsp;“no word” from the federal government that there was a serious travel risk.</p>
<p>The mayor said Wednesday that when he got on a plane to the nation’s capital in mid-March, the COVID-19 pandemic risk only became apparent while he was there.</p>

<p>Despite the virus already <a href="https://apnews.com/375d303232a6cf9dea634bb06bc0c9b0" target="_blank">hitting the Seattle area</a> and being <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/person-in-nyc-tests-positive-for-covid-19-officials/2308155/" target="_blank">identified in New York City</a> in early March, the mayor’s two-day itinerary,&nbsp;beginning March 10, included launching an international cities project with the D.C.-based Progressive Policy Institute and two German think tanks, as well as attending the National League of Cities conference.</p>
<p>“We were chosen as one of the three American cities that would be given the resources to be able to do even more to look at opportunities for everyone’s benefit in a changing economy,” he said.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Peduto’s flight home on March 11, the city had already announced the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/11/Pittsburgh-cancels-St-Patrick-s-Day-parade/stories/202003110107" target="_blank">cancellation of the St. Patrick’s Day parade</a>, following several other international and U.S. cities, including Dublin and Boston.</p>
<p>Shortly after the announcement, mayoral Chief of Staff Dan Gilman held a press conference announcing that in addition to the parade cancellation, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/11/Pittsburgh-City-employees-suspended-business-air-travel-COVID-19/stories/202003110121" target="_blank">administration would ban all international travel</a> for city employees and only grant special permission for domestic travel and restrict large city meetings.</p>
<p>Those decisions were a “direct result” from conversations that the mayor had with national health officials that day, the administration said.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto said&nbsp;“there was a lot of discussion” by mayors around the county that up until that point&nbsp;“there was no word from National Institutes of Health or the Center for Disease Control that there was a danger.”</p>
<p>“While I was down there, I had the opportunity to meet with people from the Centers for Disease Control, and what they basically said to us was, ‘we need you,’ meaning local government, ‘to lead right now,’ ” he said.</p>
<p>While the federal government has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/22/Unlike-nationwide-European-lockdowns-aggressive-restrictions-in-movement-depends-on-location-U-S/stories/202003190150" target="_blank">no authority to issue a sweeping lockdown</a>, some top level health officials had already begun warning about the risks of travel, particularly European and cruise ship travel, and of being in poorly ventilated crowded spaces, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/" target="_blank">telebriefing transcripts</a> and <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/covid-19-reminder-challenge-emerging-infectious-diseases" target="_blank">media advisories</a> from the CDC and NIH.</p>
<p>On March 13, among several staff and news media members in his Downtown conference room, Mr. Peduto <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/13/mayor-bill-peduto-press-conference-covid-19-city-response-virus-residents/stories/202003130170" target="_blank">announced an emergency declaration and a executive order</a>&nbsp;to limit social gatherings to 250. The administration tightened that figure to 50 just three days later.</p>
<p>“If you go back and look at the timeline, the city of Pittsburgh was far ahead of the federal government and was even ahead of the state government in being able to put limitations on social interaction. and that was a direct result of the conversations that I had with CDC officials in Washington,” he said.</p>
<p>If they hadn’t already begun, other localities began swiftly implementing restrictions over the following days, including the <a href="https://apnews.com/8e7c2334a3b6bf49d107973a6718254e" target="_blank">rescheduling of primary elections</a> in several states.</p>
<p>On March 19, the mayor took to Twitter to announce in a video that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/19/Pittsburgh-Mayor-Bill-Peduto-self-quarantines-isolation-coronavirus-COVID-19/stories/202003190175" target="_blank">he would begin self-isolation</a> after learning that two people at the conference had contracted COVID-19.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>The National League of Cities in a written statement defended its decision to carry on with the conference, citing partnerships between local, state and federal officials are&nbsp;“critical to public health.”</p>
<p>“[W]e leveraged our annual legislative conference in early March to ensure that coordination was front and center during the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19),” wrote Lauren Sinclair, NLC spokeswoman. “We actively monitored the guidance from DC Health and implemented illness prevention measures onsite so we could best protect the health and safety of our conference attendees.”</p>
<p>Counting back from the date of possible exposure to COVID-19 — that being March 10 — the mayor ended self-isolation Wednesday, saying by phone from his home that he had never experienced any symptoms and that he planned to report to his office at the City-County Building.</p>
