<h1>Defense wants more time to review evidence against man accused in plot to destroy North Side church</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The defense team for accused terrorist Mustafa Alowemer said Thursday it needs more time to review massive amounts of evidence turned over by the government, much of it in Arabic.</p>
<p>The judge in the case said she'll grant lawyers a 90-day extension next month but is unlikely to grant the 180 days that Andrew Lipson, a federal public defender, said he wants.</p>
<p>Mr. Alowemer, a 21-year-old Syrian refugee from Northview Heights, is accused of plotting to blow up a North Side church in the name of ISIS.</p>
<p>Mr. Lipson said the government has turned over 15,000 pages and another 27 gigabytes of evidence, such as audio and video recordings, documents and electronic communications, that defense lawyers and experts they've hired are sifting through.</p>
<p>While Assistant U.S. Attorney Soo Song said the case was "not factually complex," Mr. Lipson said the volume of material and the fact that it is mostly in Arabic will require more time to process than the evidence in a typical federal prosecution.</p>
<p>"We're putting all the resources that we have into this case," he said.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Marilyn Horan had set March 20 as the deadline for pre-trial motions and indicated she'll give the defense another 90 days after that. But Ms. Song objected to granting 180 days and the judge said she's not likely to give the defense that much time without a good reason.</p>
<p>Ms. Song also said that the investigation into Mr. Alowemer is ongoing and that there is a possibility of a superseding indictment, meaning additional charges could be filed. She provided no further details, although new charges would likely delay the case further.</p>
<p>Mr. Alowemer, who appeared in court flanked by U.S. marshals and court security officers, said nothing as he listened to an interpreter explain the case developments.</p>
<p>He is accused of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and distribution of information related to explosives in furtherance of a crime of violence.</p>
<p>Federal agents said he planned to use a backpack bomb to blow up the Legacy International Worship Center, a Nigerian church in Perry South. His co-plotters turned out to be undercover FBI agents, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>He is being held in the Mahoning County Jail.</p>
