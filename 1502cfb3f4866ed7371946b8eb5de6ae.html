<h1>Seneca Valley football shuts down because of COVID-19 exposure</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Another WPIAL Class 6A football team has shut down for two weeks because of a player's possible exposure to COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>The Seneca Valley School District issued a release saying football practice was suspended as of Tuesday. The district said it was following Pennsylvania Department of Health Protocols in shutting down the team.</p>
<p>The shutdown means Seneca Valley has to postpone its first game against North Allegheny on Sept. 11, and also cancel a Sept. 4 scrimmage against Pine-Richland. Seneca Valley’s decision comes one day after Mt. Lebanon, another Class 6A team, shut down until Sept. 2 because a player tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Seneca Valley said it has not been determined when the football team can resume practice. The reason for the postponement of the first game is because any football team in Pennsylvania must go through five heat acclimatization practices on five consecutive days, and then 10 more practice days before it can play a game.</p>
<p>With the shutdown, Seneca Valley would not be able to meet the practice minimum before the first game.</p>
<p>The Seneca Valley-North Allegheny game is declared a “no contest” for now, under WPIAL guidelines that were released Monday. But the game is a Quad County Conference contest and conference games are used to determine playoff qualifiers.</p>
<p>The WPIAL said Monday that the league will determine at the end of September or early October how to treat games that are “no contest” and might affect playoff qualifiers.</p>
