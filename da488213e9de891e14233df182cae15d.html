<h1>Olympic gymnastics champ Hernandez opens up after ex-coach Maggie Haney banned for 8 years</h1>

<p>Olympic champion gymnast Laurie Hernandez is now comfortable sharing her story.</p>
<p>Hernandez took to Instagram on Thursday, a day after her longtime U.S. Olympic coach Maggie Haney was banned by USA Gymnastics for eight years for verbal and emotional abuse of athletes.</p>
<p>The move came after two months of hearings, including testimony from Hernandez.</p>
<p>“The idea of sharing my story with the world feels extremely nerve wrecking and vulnerable,” Hernandez, who won team gold as a member of Team USA at the 2016 Rio Olympics, wrote, “but after hearing positive results last night from the panel, I felt that sharing my story could help others, or at least raise awareness to emotional and verbal abuse.”</p>
<p>Haney, 42, who also coached Hernandez at MG Elite Gymnastics in Monmouth Junction, N.J., is now barred from working with any USA Gymnastics athletes or member clubs for eight years.</p>
<p>“I had so many experiences (with Haney) that lead to multiple panic attacks where I’d just stand in front of the equipment and … cry. Hard. I felt like I couldn’t breathe; and I just wanted to go home but I couldn’t cause I was just a kid.”</p>
<p>Hernandez, who was coached by Haney for 11 years, said the abuse led her to question whether she was “too sensitive.”</p>
<p>“I questioned if my experience actually happened at all; or if it was all in my head.”</p>
<p>Haney’s abuse according to Hernandez included comments about her gaining weight, forcing her to work out on multiple injuries and yelling so loud that people in the parking lot outside the gym could hear.</p>
<p>Hernandez says she tried to tell her parents “small versions” what she was dealing with, but that led to phone calls between her mom and Haney that simply led to more abuse.</p>
<p>“Her anger at my mother’s phone calls became so strong, she’d take it out on me during practice.”</p>
<p>That led to Hernandez keeping the abuse to herself until her mom overheard a 2016 FaceTime call with one of her teammates that led to Hernandez finally revealing the full extent of the abuse.</p>
<p>“I thought I hated gymnastics,” Hernandez — who also won an individual silver medal on the balance beam in Rio — admitted, “and it wasn’t until mid 2018 I realized that it was the people that made the experience bad, not the sport itself.”</p>
<p>Hernandez, who moved to California for a “fresh start” to try and earn a spot on the 2020 Olympic team (the Tokyo games are now delayed a year due to the coronavirus pandemic) called her mental health journey “quite a rollercoaster.”</p>
<p>She called having to speak at Haney’s hearing “a painful surprise” and said he will likely spend “forever” trying to heal from the abuse.</p>
<p>Hernandez capped her post with “Here’s to speaking up” with a heart emoji.</p>
<p>Haney attorney called the ruling “regrettable” and called the investigation and hearing “heavy-handed.”</p>
<p>“There is no fundamental fairness to the manner in which these matters are resolved,” Russell Prince, Haney’s attorney, told the Southern California News Group. “Clearly, I would anticipate an arbitration.”</p>
<p>Judie Saunders, a lawyer representing Hernandez and some of the other gymnasts in the case, said the penalties against Haney were “a micro step in the right direction for how athletes are treated in the hypercompetitive world of sports.”</p>
<p>Haney’s suspension is the latest turbulence in a period of upheaval for USA Gymnastics after revelations that Larry Nassar, a national team doctor, had sexually abused hundreds of athletes. The organization has filed for bankruptcy and offered $217 million to settle legal claims brought by athletes molested by Nassar, who in 2018 received prison sentences of up to 175 years.</p>
<p>The disciplinary hearing for Haney began on Feb. 3. She received an interim suspension that day barring her from contact with minors in the sport.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until she was suspended at the start of the hearing, Haney continued to coach at national team camps while under investigation. Haney also coached at last summer’s Pan-American Games, where McCusker won five medals.</p>
<p>Concerns about the practices of Victoria Levine, an assistant MG Elite coach who is partial owner of the gym where the team trains, were raised during the hearing. Levine received an interim suspension on March 17 that barred her from unsupervised contact with minors.</p>
<p>Haney has had at least one athlete on the junior or senior national team every year since 2013.</p>
<p>Until recently, she had coached Riley McCusker, a member of the United States team that won the 2018 world championship, at MG Elite.</p>
<p>McCusker, 18, is considered a strong candidate to make the American team for the Tokyo Olympics next year, though she had to withdraw from a selection camp for last year’s world championships because of mild rhabdomyolysis, a muscle disorder associated with overtraining. McCusker moved in February to train with the Arizona Sunrays, working alongside Jade Carey, another national team member.</p>
<p>McCusker, through her mother Jessica, declined to comment.</p>
