<h1>2020 NFL draft: Kenny Robinson, a Wilkinsburg native, is first XFL player drafted</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em><strong>This is a developing story and will be updated.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Kenny Robinson’s</strong> “lifelong dream” — one that looked so improbable a year ago — was fulfilled Saturday.</p>
<p>Robinson, a Wilkinsburg native and former Imani Christian star, was selected by the Carolina Panthers at No. 151 overall, the sixth pick in Saturday’s fifth round. The former West Virginia safety was the first XFL product to be selected in the 2020 NFL draft.</p>
<p>“It would mean the world to me,” Robinson told the Post-Gazette in March, on the prospect of being drafted. “I’d be able to do what I love for a living.”</p>
<p>Robinson’s journey to the draft is certainly unique. After registering 77 tackles as a sophomore with the Mountaineers in 2018, he was expelled from West Virginia, being flagged for student misconduct related to classwork. Instead of transferring elsewhere — a tricky avenue given his academic standing — Robinson opted for the XFL.</p>
<p>Robinson hoped to help his parents financially, with his mother’s colon cancer diagnosis a year earlier in the forefront of his mind. He was drafted by the St. Louis Battlehawks in October 2019, and in five games, he logged two interceptions.</p>
<p>Taking his production at West Virginia into account, the 6-foot-2, 200-pound safety has nine picks in his last 30 games. New head coach Matt Rhule and the Panthers — who also took a chance and signed XFL star quarterback PJ Walker — are banking on Robinson bringing that play-making ability to the NFC South.</p>
<p>Robinson was the first WPIAL player to hear his name called, followed a little later by McKeesport standout and Michigan linebacker <strong>Khaleke Hudson</strong>. The athletic blitzer — who was ranked No. 250 overall by Dane Brugler, The Athletic’s draft analyst — went earlier than most expected. Hudson was selected by the Washington Redskins at No. 161 overall, the 17th pick of the fifth round.</p>
<p>Hudson, the Post-Gazette’s 2015 high school football player of the year, appeared in 52 games at Michigan with 37 starts at the Wolverines’ “Viper” position, a safety/linebacker hybrid role. He holds Michigan’s record for most tackles for loss in a single game (eight, vs. Minnesota in 2017) and is a versatile piece now for Ron Rivera in Washington.</p>
<p>“He’ll play over the slot, and he’ll match up over tight ends. He’s a little bit tight in his change of direction, but he does have some thump as a tackler,” NFL Network draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah said on ESPN’s broadcast. “I think he plays bigger than his size at 5-foot-11. ... I think he’s going to have to make this team for what he does on fourth down and on special teams.”</p>
<p>Hudson and Robinson aren’t the only players with local ties to find a new home this weekend. Five Penn State players — defensive end <strong>Yetur Gross-Matos</strong>, wide receiver <strong>KJ Hamler</strong>, cornerback <strong>John Reid</strong>, linebacker <strong>Cam Brown</strong> and defensive tackle <strong>Robert Windsor</strong> — were drafted. Gross-Matos and Hamler went to the Panthers and Denver Broncos, respectively, in the second round, while Reid, Brown and Windsor were picked up on Saturday.</p>
<p>Reid, a three-year starter with the Nittany Lions, was selected by the Houston Texas at No. 141 overall, the 35th pick of Saturday’s fourth round.</p>
<p>Reid is a crafty corner who might have gone higher if not for an ill-timed injury. The former St. Joseph’s Prep (Philadelphia) star started all 14 games and earned an honorable mention All-Big Ten nod as a sophomore in 2016, but tore his ACL in 2017. Reid’s playing confidence took a hit with the injury, as he needed time in 2018 to knock off the rust and return to form.</p>
<p>But his noteworthy man-to-man skills re-emerged this past season, enough to be picked up in the fourth round. The Texans are also getting a smart kid; Reid, an electrical engineering major who graduated in December, interned with Intel two summers ago. Maybe Reid can help out Houston’s IT department, too, when he’s not competing for time at corner.</p>
<p>“This year, he put it all together,” ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. said on the broadcast. “This season, you could make a strong argument he was one of Penn State’s best defensive players. Week in and week out, the consistency he showed was really impressive.”</p>
<p>Brown, meanwhile, was taken by the New York Giants at No. 183 overall, the fourth pick of the sixth round.</p>
<p>Brown, a rangy, 6-foot-5 tackler, served as a team captain for Penn State in 2019 and landed on the All-Big Ten third team, as voted on by the coaches. The former four-star recruit out of Maryland started all 13 games last year, tallying 72 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, two sacks and four pass breakups.</p>
<p>Brown benefited from Penn State's pass rush, led by Gross-Matos but aided by Windsor, whom the Colts selected 193rd overall. Windsor, who was also named to the 2019 All-Big Ten third team by the coaches, had 3.5 sacks last season but was more productive in 2018. The Wisconsin native recorded 11 TFLs and 7.5 sacks two years ago.</p>
<p>With Reid, Brown and Windsor already accounted for, Penn State&nbsp;offensive guard <strong>Steven Gonzalez</strong> might go in the seventh round.</p>
<p>Pitt’s <strong>Dane Jackson</strong> — like Reid, an impressive man-to-man option in the secondary — is still on the board despite earning fifth and sixth-round grades. New Castle standout and Iowa safety <strong>Geno Stone</strong> ought to hear his name called, too.</p>
