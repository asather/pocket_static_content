<h1>Penn Hills man arrested for theft of $19K from ATM vehicle outside Rite Aid in McKees Rocks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Penn Hills man was arrested Wednesday morning after police said he broke into an ATM serviceman's vehicle outside a Rite Aid in McKees Rocks and stole $19,500 back in December.</p>
<p>After more than four months of investigating the incident, Allegheny County police charged 48-year-old Luis Carde. He was taken into custody Wednesday at his home in Penn Hills without incident, police said. They would not say how they came to the conclusion that Mr. Carde is a suspect, citing an&nbsp;“ongoing investigation.”</p>
<p>Mr. Carde is charged with theft by unlawful taking, criminal conspiracy, theft from a motor vehicle and criminal mischief.</p>
<p>Authorities on Dec. 30 met with the employee of a company that fills ATMs for a report that $19,500 had been stolen from their vehicle in the 1700 block of Pine Hollow Road in Kennedy. The passenger window of the vehicle had been smashed while the worker serviced an ATM out of view in front of Rite Aid, county police said.</p>
<p>“It was not obvious what the vehicle was,” Allegheny County Police Sgt. Todd Dolfi said.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for June 16 before&nbsp;District Judge Carla M. Swearingen-Batch.</p>
<p>Anyone with information concerning this incident is asked to call the Allegheny County Police Tipline at 1-833-255-8477; callers can remain anonymous. Police can also be reached via social media.</p>
