<h1>20 albums to anticipate in 2020, from Cardi B to the Doobie Brothers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s been a little slow lately for new music, but things will pick up in the next few weeks and 2020 should be a busy year.</p>
<p>Here are some releases that we know about:</p>
<p><strong>Halsey, “Manic”</strong> (Jan. 17): The electropop hitmaker from New Jersey has stated that her third record will in fact be manic and all over the place stylistically.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Flag,&nbsp;“20/20 Vision” </strong>(Jan. 17): Reacting to three years of Trump, expect a fiery album from the veteran Pittsburgh punks.</p>
<p><strong>Kesha, “High Road”</strong> (Jan. 31): Kesha promises a return to her pop roots on this fourth album that features guest appearances by Big Freedia, Sturgill Simpson and Brian Wilson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Frances Quinlan, “Likewise”</strong> (Jan. 31): The first solo album from the emotive Philly-bred Hop Along frontwoman, recorded with her bandmate Joe Reinhart, comes with a cover of Built to Spill’s “Carry the Zero.”</p>
<p><strong>Green Day, “Father of All ...”</strong> (Feb. 7): We can expect the usual exuberance, and maybe then some, from the ageless pop-punk trio that will head out on the Hella Mega Tour with album No. 13.</p>
<p><strong>Tame Impala, “The Slow Rush”</strong> (Feb. 14): At last, the follow-up to 2015’s “Currents,” recorded, produced and mixed by Australian psych-rocker Kevin Parker, who told The New York Times, “A lot of the songs carry this idea of time passing, of seeing your life flash before your eyes, being able to see clearly your life from this point onwards.”</p>
<p><strong>Grimes, “Miss Anthropocene”</strong> (Feb. 21): Five years after “Art Angels,” the Canadian art-pop singer-songwriter returns with what she’s called “a concept album about the anthropomorphic goddess of climate change.”</p>
<p><strong>The 1975, “Notes on a Conditional Form”</strong> (Feb. 21): The fourth album from the British band is expected to include 20 tracks, including the screaming single “People.”</p>
<p><strong>Alanis Morissette, “Such Pretty Forks in the Road”</strong> (May 1): The 25th anniversary of “Jagged Little Pill” is timed with a Broadway musical based on the album’s themes written by Oscar-winning writer Diablo Cody (“Juno”). Morissette is also releasing her first new album since 2012, led by the single “Reasons I Drink.”</p>
<p><strong>Weezer, “Van Weezer”</strong> (May 15): Would you believe this is the 14th album from Weezer? This time, the band will go with heavy riffage, leaning on influences like Kiss and Van Halen, the inspiration for the title.</p>
<p><strong>The Killers, “Imploding the Mirage”</strong> (spring): The first album in three years from the Vegas rockers was preceded by a politically charged gospel-inflected ballad, “Land of the Free,” brought to life with a Spike Lee-directed video.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Berninger, “Serpentine Prison”</strong> (TBA): Speaking with NME, The National frontman said of his debut solo album, produced by Memphis soul legend Booker T. Jones, “I just wanted to see if I could do something by myself, so I brought in 20 of the most brilliant musicians and some of the coolest people I know.”</p>
<p><strong>Code Orange</strong> (title and date TBA): This week marks three years since the Pittsburgh hardcore/metal band released “Forever,” the breakout third album that earned them widespread acclaim and a Grammy nomination. In 2020, we’ll hear what brutal sounds they’ve been brewing.</p>
<p><strong>Ozzy Osbourne, “Ordinary Man”</strong> (TBA): The metal icon will head out on “No More Tours 2” with this 12th studio album backed by producer/guitarist Andrew Watt, bassist Duff McKagan (Guns N’ Roses) and drummer Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers) and preceded by the singles “Under the Graveyard” and “Straight to Hell.”</p>
<p><strong>Cardi B</strong> (TBA): The NYC rapper will follow her Grammy-winning 2018 debut, “Invasion of Privacy,” with a second album that may or may not be called “Tiger Woods.”</p>
<p><strong>Dua Lipa, “Future Nostalgia”</strong> (early 2020): The British dance-pop sensation says she was aiming for more of a “live element” on her sophomore album, which was inspired by artists “from Gwen Stefani to Madonna to Moloko to Blondie and Outkast, to name just a few.”</p>
<p><strong>Lil Baby, “My Turn”</strong> (early 2020): The Grammy-nominated Atlanta rapper behind “Drip Too Hard” posted on Instagram that for his second album, “I called it ‘My Turn’ ’cause I feel like everybody else had a lil’ turn. It’s my turn now.”</p>
<p><strong>Marilyn Manson</strong> (TBA): The shock-rocker, who recently released an explosive cover of The Doors’ “The End,” is working with Shooter Jennings on the follow-up to 2017’s “Heaven Upside Down.”</p>
<p><strong>Doobie Brothers</strong> (TBA): On this 50th anniversary year, the Doobies, working with producer John Shanks (Bon Jovi, Sheryl Crow, Goo Goo Dolls), will release their first new material since 2010’s “World Gone Crazy.”</p>
<p><strong>Dixie Chicks, “Gaslighter”</strong> (TBA): For the first studio album in 14 years, the country-pop trio hooked up with hitmaker Jack Antonoff (Taylor Swift, Lorde, St. Vincent).</p>
