<p>A North Versailles man was arrested Tuesday on charges that he robbed a bank in the township last fall, according to authorities.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office said&nbsp;D’el Mackey, 38, had been wanted on a federal warrant since Nov. 13 in connection with the robbery of Huntington Bank in the Great Valley Shopping Center near Walmart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police said Mr. Mackey passed a note to the bank teller asking for money — and they obliged — before he fled. He was identified as wearing a yellow rain jacket, a black hat, white gloves, black pants and carrying a backpack in surveillance video.&nbsp;An arrest warrant was issued for Mr. Mackey less than seven hours after the incident, police said.</p>
<p>Authorities said they arrested him Tuesday at a friend’s house in the 500 block of Third Street in Clairton after learning where he was living, police said.&nbsp;He was arrested without incident and taken to FBI headquarters on the South Side to be interviewed.</p>
