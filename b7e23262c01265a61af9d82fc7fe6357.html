<h1>Church rebounds from cluster of COVID cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Early in the second week of March, when people were still going to classes and concerts and jobs, Paul Wood was attending a committee meeting at Eastminster Presbyterian Church when the topic of the looming coronavirus came up.</p>
<p>“We were thinking the worst-case scenario the building could be shut down,” recalled Mr. Wood, an elder and the clerk of the East Liberty church’s session or governing body.</p>
<p>Within three days, the building was indeed shut down, as were most churches before long. But unlike most, Eastminster had more on its hands than figuring out how to get everyone onto the livestream.</p>
<p>On the Thursday of that week, the church learned a couple of members had tested positive for COVID-19, at least one of whom had attended church the previous Sunday, March 8.</p>
<p>By that Thursday, March 12, the virus was already spreading in the congregation. The pastor had come down ill at a well-attended mid-week service the day before, and his positive test came back that Sunday.</p>
<p>In all, more than a dozen people connected with the congregation came down with COVID-19. All have gotten over the worst of it, and there don’t appear to be any new cases. One member was seriously ill enough to be hospitalized but is now on the mend, church leaders said.</p>
<p>But in those days of mid-March, “all of a sudden our congregation was in the middle of this,” said the Rev. Paul Roberts, the longtime pastor of Eastminster, who has now recovered with just residual symptoms. “We were the epicenter.”</p>
<p>The outbreak required numerous people to self-quarantine if they had contact with infected parishioners.</p>
<p>The church quickly mobilized care teams for the parishioners, regularly checking on those who were sick, and those living alone, and offering to deliver food, medicine and other necessities.</p>
<p>So while the church did put some worship activities online, leaders had to set priorities, Mr. Wood said. “What is our goal? The goal was to care for people.”</p>
<p>Even if that care wasn’t what people were used to , Mr. Wood said.</p>
<p>“It’s surreal,” he said. “We delivered soup to a couple who were ill with COVID-19 — some soup, some bread, some apple pie. They came to the door, we walked up and sent it on the ground and we stepped back 10 feet. it’s uncomfortable. We’re used to hugging.”</p>
<p>The church’s ordeal began the Sunday of March 8. At least one attendee had returned from a ski trip out West, where the virus had been spreading at mountain resorts.</p>
<p>In the following days, Rev. Roberts began having slight cough. The church had a midweek Lenten gathering on the 11th.</p>
<p>“It hit me Wednesday night, about halfway through,” he said. “I just said, man, I'm feeling rotten, I'm hot and I'm exhausted all of a sudden. By the time I got home, now I was starting to have some chills, I took my temperature, and sure enough I was running a fever.”</p>
<p>He went to the couch&nbsp;“and lay there for days, not doing anything,” he said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the church learned of the member’s infection. The Allegheny County Board of Health provided it with information that the church circulated to the congregants to alert everyone who was potentially exposed.</p>
<p>Rev. Roberts got the test and, as he awaited results, church leaders moved swiftly to close the building, notify members and prepare online worship and care teams. Elders had emergency Zoom meetings that weekend.</p>
<p>“It was at that second meeting that our pastor said, ‘Guess what? ... I've been diagnosed,’” recalled Mr. Wood. “There was an audible gasp.”</p>
<p>The pastor was in multiple groups at risk for getting the brunt of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“I am a type 2 diabetic, I’ve had two heart attacks and I'm asthmatic,” Rev. Roberts recalled. He’s also over 60. But the illness never turned serious.</p>
<p>“That’s part of the mystery of this whole virus,” he said, “why for some people it immediately attacks the respiratory system and it’s devastating, and for some people it’s not.”</p>
<p>Rev. Roberts’ wife and daughter also recovered from COVID-19.</p>
<p>The county’s policy is not to comment on specific cases, but it confirmed its protocol for contact tracing when there are clusters of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>“If the Health Department identifies a common exposure among several cases, the department can provide specific infection control guidance to that facility or the people infected to help stop the spread of the disease.” said county spokeswoman Amie Downs.</p>
<p>Rev. Roberts acknowledged this is the sort of event he never trained for in seminary.</p>
<p>Nor has been the larger arc of his and the church’s ministry, where he has been pastor for the last 18 years.</p>
<p>The church has made a deliberate effort at racial diversity. Of its 150 regularly attending, Rev. Roberts estimated that about 45 percent each are African-American and white, the rest other ethnicities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The church put in “years of hard work,&nbsp;hiring cross culturally, having racial reconciliation classes, programming cross-culturally,” he said.</p>
<p>And those bonds remained firm during the recent crisis, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Wood said as he spoke to church members about fellow congregants being infected,&nbsp;“I didn’t hear anyone saying, “Oh my goodness, what’s going to happen to me?’ I just heard, ‘Are they OK? Is there anything we can do for them?’”</p>
<p>He added: “That’s I guess very churchy, but it’s also what happens.”</p>
