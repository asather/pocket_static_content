<h1>Heinz Endowments boosts COVID-19 relief efforts by $6 million </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Heinz Endowments is doling out another $6 million in grants targeted for COVID-19 relief efforts in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>The funding includes money to be used for public and environmental health initiatives, food, small business assistance, and support for artists and arts groups.</p>
<p>The endowments, a Downtown-based philanthropy created from the fortunes of heirs to the H.J. Heinz food conglomerate, last month formed a $5-million emergency fund to address critical needs during the pandemic and made 43 grants to nonprofits involved in relief.</p>
<p>At a board meeting last week, its directors unanimously approved supplementing those efforts with $6.4 million.</p>
<p>“A crisis like this tests nothing so much as what we truly value,” Grant Oliphant, president of the endowments said in a statement. “These grants express a commitment to a community that prizes its creativity, its environment, its potential, and the need shared by all its people for everything from food and shelter to dignity and meaning.”</p>
<p>The new funding includes 18 grants totaling $4.5 million plus nearly $2 million in a contingency fund for artists, arts groups, and relief and outreach efforts in the Hazelwood neighborhood.</p>
<p>The endowments is a partner in Hazelwood Green, a development located on a former steel mill site along the Monongahela River in Hazelwood, and has been working for years to integrate the development with the adjacent community.</p>
<p>The largest grant in the endowments’ new funding round is $775,000 to the Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project, which will help craft policies on public health impacts of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Other large grants include $600,000 to Trying Together, an advocacy agency for childcare and education; $400,000 to Locally Grown to support entrepreneurs and residents at its business accelerator and community center in Wilkinsburg; $200,000 to Bridgeway Capital to assist small businesses impacted by the pandemic; and $230,000 to the Hill Community Development Corp. for programs that address health and economic impacts of the virus in the Hill District.</p>
<p>At last week’s board meeting, the endowments also approved $7 million in grants focused on equity issues including criminal justice reform and support for minorities in the region.</p>
<p>Though that funding is separate from its COVID-19 relief, Mr. Oliphant acknowledged the pandemic is “exacerbating issues of poverty and racial inequity in our community.”</p>
