<h1>Sides make closing arguments in the Wilkinsburg mass shooting trial</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Both sides in the Wilkinsburg mass murder trial have made their&nbsp;closing arguments and the jury will get the case later Monday&nbsp;afternoon following a lunch break and the judge's instructions.</p>
<p>They will consider both first- and third-degree murder charges against&nbsp;Cheron Shelton, who is accused of killing five adults and an unborn&nbsp;child on March 9, 2016 in Wilkinsburg.</p>
<p>Prosecutors believe Shelton, 33, of Lincoln-Lemington and another man,&nbsp;Robert Thomas, who was charged but had his case dismissed one week ago&nbsp;for lack of evidence, opened fire on a group of unsuspecting victims&nbsp;during a backyard cookout, spurred by a vendetta Shelton had against&nbsp;one of the attendees.</p>
<p>Shelton's lawyer, Randall McKinney, spent an hour trying to convince&nbsp;jurors that the prosecution's case amounted to a series of red&nbsp;herrings and weak evidence that investigators tried to bend to their&nbsp;will in order to implicate Shelton.</p>
<p>Mr. McKinney dissected each piece of the prosecution's evidence —&nbsp;surveillance video, a cache of ammunition found in Shelton's mother's&nbsp;house, letters sent from jail and jailhouse video — and tried to&nbsp;convince jurors to view it in a light favorable to Shelton. While&nbsp;prosecutors strung the evidence together and said it pointed to&nbsp;Shelton being guilty, Mr. McKinney asked the jury to attribute far&nbsp;more benign motives.</p>
<p>Mr. McKinney cast his client as a drug dealer seeking to make money,&nbsp;one who had just been released from jail the day before the shooting&nbsp;over a domestic dispute and was happy and eager to see his girlfriend,&nbsp;their children and his friends.</p>
<p>Shelton, he said, is not a ruthless killer who set out to gun down&nbsp;members of a family as an act of revenge.</p>
<p>Mr. McKinney told jurors that prosecutors must take a brick wall that&nbsp;represented proof beyond a reasonable doubt and entirely dismantle the&nbsp;obstacle so that not a single brick remains. He contended that the&nbsp;Allegheny County District Attorney's Office had not done that.</p>
<p>He acknowledged a natural urge to hold someone accountable for horrific crimes.</p>
<p>"But you have to resist it," Mr. McKinney said, "because the evidence&nbsp;in this case, the lack of evidence in this case, proves to us that the&nbsp;only appropriate verdict is not guilty."</p>
<p>Deputy District Attorney Kevin Chernosky, who had the last words in&nbsp;the courtroom in asking the jury for a guilty verdict, dismissed Mr.&nbsp;McKinney's arguments.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that prosecutors had a circumstantial case — no&nbsp;fingerprints, DNA, eyewitnesses or murder weapons — but he said they&nbsp;had a timeline and surveillance video that taken together put Shelton&nbsp;leaving his mother's house in Homewood with a rifle, arriving at the&nbsp;crime scene and then leaving after the shooting at 10:53 p.m.</p>
<p>"This case is a circumstantial case, and sometimes that comes off with&nbsp;a bad connotation. But the circumstances don't lie to you," Mr.&nbsp;Chernosky said.</p>
<p>Holding up a long, battered piece of painted blue wood from the crime&nbsp;scene, Mr. Chernosky said, "This railing was the only thing between&nbsp;him and the victims in this case when he opened fire unmercifully."</p>
<p>There were 48 shots total fired — 18 from a .40-caliber handgun that&nbsp;police believe Thomas used, and 30 from a rifle firing 7.62-caliber&nbsp;bullets that they say Shelton wielded.</p>
<p>"There were times when he stopped," Mr. Chernosky said, alluding to&nbsp;the sound of gunfire that was played for the jury earlier in the&nbsp;trial, "there were times when he could have stopped."</p>
