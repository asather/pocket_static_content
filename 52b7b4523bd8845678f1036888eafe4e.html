<p>Six more employees at the Smithfield Foods Inc. meat processing plant in Arnold tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to Pittsburgh Post-Gazette news partner KDKA.</p>
<p>According to United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1776, the total number of employees at the plant that have tested positive is now at 12.</p>
<p>The union represents just over 100 people at the plant and about 35,000 workers throughout the state.</p>
