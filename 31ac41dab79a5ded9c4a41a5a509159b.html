<h1>Ben Roethlisberger on Steelers drafting a QB: 'That's their prerogative'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Ben Roethlisberger said he doesn’t pay the slightest bit of attention to offseason coverage of the Steelers, especially mock drafts that try to take into account their strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement.</p>
<p>So former NFL quarterback — and one-time Roethlisberger backup -—&nbsp;Bruce Gradkowski must have informed him that more and more national draft analysts are advocating for the Steelers to eschew wide receivers, running backs and defensive help in favor of drafting a quarterback of the future with their first pick next week.</p>
<p>“They have to do what they have to do,” Roethlisberger said of the Steelers’ use of their second-round pick Thursday on Gradkowski’s SiriusXM radio show with Bruce Murray. “We’ve got some quarterbacks on the roster, but if they feel like there’s a better one out there, then they have to go get him. And that’s their prerogative. That’s why they’re the owners, the GMs and the coaches, and we just play. It’s not going to change my mindset, my mentality, my motivation.</p>
<p>“I’m <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2020/03/20/ben-roethlisberger-update-steelers-offseason-2020-ramon-foster/stories/202003220038" target="_blank">trying to come off an injury</a>, so I’m going to give everything I have. If they go draft a quarterback with our first pick in the second, it’s not like it’s going to make me go out there and try to be any better, because I’m already trying to do that anyway.”</p>
<p>The most recent projection to raise eyebrows is ESPN’s Mel Kiper slotting Oklahoma dual-threat quarterback <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/15/Jalen-Hurts-to-the-Steelers-Mel-Kiper-explains-why/stories/202004150112" target="_blank">Jalen Hurts to the Steelers</a> at No. 49 overall, but other draft gurus have placed Washington’s rifle-armed pocket-passer Jacob Eason there. Dan Orlovsky, an ex-NFL quarterback who now appears on ESPN, even suggested the Steelers trade up for Utah State’s high-upside project Jordan Love.</p>
<p>It was just two years ago the Steelers used a third-rounder on Mason Rudolph, who now enters Year 3 in Pittsburgh after filling in for Roethlisberger last season until injuries and a benching ended his season.</p>
<p>“I don’t even look at it,” Roethlisberger said of the draft speculation.&nbsp;“I don’t worry about it, care about it. That probably sounds like a bad way to say it, but these guys — everybody that’s played in college is great, right? It doesn’t mean they’re going to be a great NFL player. There’s been some great, great college football players that haven’t done anything in the NFL. There’s been some good or average college players that have been great in the NFL.</p>
<p>“To me, until you come to this team and you show me that you can do something on Sundays, it’s hard for me to get really excited. Because we’ve got guys on this team already that have shown what they can do on Sundays, you know?”</p>
