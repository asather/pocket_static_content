<h1>Penguins camp primer: When it comes to the third line, whose line is it anyway?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With the NHL targeting July 13 for the start of full-squad training camps in Phase 3 of its return-to-play plan, Penguins beat reporters Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are counting down the days until Pens Camp Part Deux by examining some of the key questions that will be waiting when the Penguins hit the ice.:</em></p>
<p>To fully appreciate the Penguins’ newfound forward depth at training camp, let’s first remember how desperate things got.</p>
<p>On Oct. 16, they weren’t just injured, they were decimated to an almost comical point that defenseman Juuso Riikola added a slash to his job description, suiting up as a fourth-line winger. Asked how he thought he played, the soft-spoken defenseman said, “not a lot.”</p>
<p>How things change. When the Penguins open camp, they’ll do so with a lineup bolstered by trades and benefitting from the extended layoff. There’s an argument to be made that no team gained more from the NHL’s pause than the Penguins because they’ll get Jake Guentzel back.</p>
<p>Now, with the All-Star winger back in action, coach Mike Sullivan will be faced with a good problem: options, and plenty of them.</p>
<p>It’s a sign that nature is healing that we’re once again talking about Penguins line combinations. Let’s start with what we know.</p>
<p>During Phase 2, Sidney Crosby, Guentzel and Conor Sheary skated together during the informal sessions. That’s probably not a coincidence. That trio formed the so-called “Sid and the Kids” line during the 2017 Stanley Cup run. With Guentzel back from his major shoulder injury and Sheary again in the fold after a deadline-day trade, that’s a possible — if not likely — combo for the top line, especially with Dominik Simon out for the playoffs following labrum surgery.</p>
<p>Moving on, Evgeni Malkin and Bryan Rust both enjoyed outstanding seasons while paired together. For Malkin, it was a bounce-back year during which he was tied for the fifth-most points per game (1.35). And for Rust, it was a career year during which he led the Penguins in goals with 27. If there’s a good reason to split up these two, it’s hard to think of one. The question is, who is the third wheel? Assuming Guentzel is on the top line, Jason Zucker would be a pretty decent bet. The Penguins didn’t give up a first-round pick and their best prospect, Calen Addison, only to play Zucker in the bottom-six.</p>
<p>Skipping to the fourth line, Zach Aston-Reese, Teddy Blueger and Brandon Tanev stuck together more than any other combination this season. Together, this group found a clear identity as a tight-checking, defensively conscious unit. It would be no surprise to see this trio together — and playing against the opponent’s top line.</p>
<p>That brings us to the biggest question: What do the Penguins do with the third line?</p>
<p>Since Jared McCann came over from Florida last season, there have been questions about exactly how he fit. Is he a center or a wing? Top-six or bottom-six? Hornqvist has obviously scored some significant postseason goals for the Penguins in a top-six role. But with the newfound depth, could he slide down into a different part of the lineup? Patrick Marleau played some on the Malkin line when he was acquired. Was that because the Penguins like him in that role, or was it out of necessity? And what happens with Evan Rodrigues, Sam Lafferty, Anthony Angello and others? Are they just depth, or do the Penguins have a vision for them?</p>
<p>The third line will help answer a lot of those questions — ones that could get more complicated if Nick Bjugstad returns from spinal surgery.</p>
<p>It’s just a guess, but one possible lineup would be Marleau on the left wing, Hornqvist on the right and McCann down the middle. However, Marleau has also played center, so he and McCann could flip flop. Or maybe one of the others fights for time on the third line.</p>
<p>No one knows exactly how the pieces will fit just yet. But one thing is for sure: Don’t expect to see Riikola at forward.</p>
