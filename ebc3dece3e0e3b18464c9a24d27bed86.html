<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburghers talking about their reactions to the 2018 Tree of Life massacre will be presented in an interactive webinar on Tuesday, as part of an oral history project by New York’s&nbsp;Museum of Jewish Heritage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tuesday virtual event,&nbsp;titled “After The Synagogue Shooting: Pittsburghers Reflect On Antisemitism and Racism,” is part of <a href="https://hac.bard.edu/programs/meanings/" target="_blank">“Meanings of October 27,”</a> a project created by Noah Schoen and Aliza Becker “that explores Jewish and non-Jewish Pittsburghers’ life histories and reflections” on the day when 11 congregants were killed in a Squirrel Hill synagogue shooting.</p>
<p>It was the most deadly attack on a Jewish community in the history of the United States.</p>
<p>An audio portion of&nbsp;“Meanings” —&nbsp;featuring Pittsburghers Tammy Hepps, declaring,&nbsp;“We are not afraid and we will speak truth to power”; Ira Frank, talking about synagogue security; and Monica Ruiz, sharing what it was like to be a non-Jew at a community vigil in Squirrel Hill — is available <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-273644587/meanings-promo." target="_blank">at the museum website</a>.</p>
<p>The event is free and will be live streamed via Zoom,&nbsp;<a href="https://mjhnyc.org/events/after-the-synagogue-shooting-pittsburghers-reflect-on-antisemitism-and-racism/" target="_blank">https://mjhnyc.org/events/</a>, at 2 p.m. Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
