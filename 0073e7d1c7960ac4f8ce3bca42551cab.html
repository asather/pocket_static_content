<p>BERLIN — Six people have been killed and several were injured in a shooting in the southwestern German town of Rot am See, police said Friday.</p>
<p>A suspect was arrested shortly after the shooting, which took place at 12:45 p.m. (1145 GMT) Friday near the town’s train station, police said. They said no other suspects are believed to be at large.</p>
<p>“According to my information, there were six dead and several injured,” Aalen police spokesman Rudolf Biehlmaier told German broadcaster n-tv.</p>
<p>“We are working on the assumption that this was a single attacker,” he said.</p>
<p>Biehlmaier said the initial information suggested the suspect, a German citizen, and one or more of the victims knew each other.</p>
<p>Some of the victims belonged to the same family, he added.</p>
<p>In a statement, police said further information would be released at a news conference with prosecutors and local officials at 4:30 p.m. (1530 GMT.)</p>
<p>Rot am See is located about 105 miles northwest of Munich.</p>
