<h1>Mail-in ballots could mean faster results when polls close in today's Pa. primary election</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A significant chunk of election results could be available as soon as polls close in Tuesday’s primary election in Allegheny County, officials say.</p>
<p>This would be a departure from past elections, when counties weren’t permitted to start tallying their absentee ballots until at least 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Now they’re allowed to start counting absentees —&nbsp;and the thousands and thousands of mail-in ballots that were a new feature in this year’s contests as well —&nbsp;at 7 a.m., a task that Allegheny County is committing dozens of staffers to in a guarded warehouse.</p>
<p>If all goes as planned, when 8 p.m. hits, they’ll have tallied a majority of the more than 188,000 mail-in or absentee ballots they’ve received, and will be allowed to post those results right away, officials said —&nbsp;giving the public an immediate look at who’s winning all the races.</p>
<p>Results will be partial, though, and the final outcomes of races won’t be determined —&nbsp;in most cases —&nbsp;at least until in-person votes from Tuesday’s polling places are counted, which could take a few hours.</p>
<p>There could also be holdups in the dayside absentee and mail-in counting, officials acknowledged, which could levy unforeseen delays.</p>
<p>“We’ve never scanned 180,000 ballots here before,” elections division manager David Voye said Monday. “It may take a lot longer than we anticipate.”</p>
<p>“We have over 100 people working on this,” Mr. Voye added. “I don’t know what time we’ll finish, but we intend on staying here until we’re done.”</p>
<p>Another factor that could potentially delay the final outcomes in some races is that Allegheny County voters are now allowed to postmark their mail-in or absentee ballots on Tuesday and put them in the mail. Gov. Tom Wolf, by executive order on Monday, pushed back the deadline one week for the county —&nbsp;and five others —&nbsp;to count those ballots by mail.</p>
<p>While 188,000 voted ballots had been returned to Allegheny County as of Monday, more than 280,000 had applied.</p>
<p>Voters in Allegheny County can still submit their mail-in and absentee ballots in-person on Tuesday, if they choose, by dropping them off in the lobby of the county-office building at 542 Forbes Ave. between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m.</p>
<p>The county gave reporters a walkthrough of its ballot-counting operation on Monday, a multi-step process that includes using letter-opening machines to extract mail-in and absentee ballots from envelopes and high-capacity scanners to tally them.</p>
<p>Technicians will be on site in case there are issues with either machine type, said Chet Harhut, deputy manager of the elections division.</p>
<p>Mr. Voye said the county ran a computer-generated test of the ballot scanners —&nbsp;which are being used for the first time this election —&nbsp;with a test sample of 50,000 ballots.</p>
<p>“All ballots were tabulated correctly and matched the outcome we expected,” Mr. Voye said.</p>
<p>The test run took about four hours, and didn’t include the physical opening of envelopes, Mr. Voye said.</p>
<p>When polls close at 8 p.m., the warehouse also will begin to receive the locked ballot boxes from in-person polling places —&nbsp;hand-delivered by authorized officials. The only people who have the keys, officials said, are the ballot scanner operators.</p>
<p>Once batches of ballots are scanned and tallied, the machines print off a piece of paper indicating how many ballots were in that particular batch, what time it was printed and which machine they were scanned on, officials said.</p>
<p>The tallied ballots are then stored in a locked room.</p>
