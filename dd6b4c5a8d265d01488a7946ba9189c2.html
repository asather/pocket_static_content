<h1>Quaker Valley's Dom Reiter selected Pa. soccer player of year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was back in December that Quaker Valley High School senior Dom Reiter was named the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-soccer/2019/12/13/Post-Gazette-Boys-Soccer-Player-of-the-Year-Dom-Reiter-all-area-team/stories/201912110009" target="_blank">Post-Gazette Player of the Year </a>for the WPIAL. Six months later, he gets another POY award for the entire state.</p>
<p>Reiter was named the Gatorade Pennsylvania Player of the Year on Monday. Although high school soccer in Pennsylvania is played in the fall, Gatorade waits until the spring to select players of the year for each state.</p>
<p>Reiter had a tremendous senior season, leading Quaker Valley to a 24-2 record and WPIAL and PIAA Class 2A championships. A forward, Reiter tallied a school-record 55 goals and 24 assists.</p>
<p>Reiter also had a flair for the dramatic, coming up big in Quaker Valley’s biggest games. His twin brother, Fritz, also played a big role in Dom’s memorable moments.</p>
<p>In the WPIAL championship against Deer Lakes, Dom scored the winning goal in overtime after Fritz lofted a ball over the top that Dom chased down. Quaker Valley won the PIAA championship with a 2-1 victory against New Hope Salisbury. The Reiter brothers scored the two goals and also assisted the other.</p>
<p>Dom Reiter finished his Quaker Valley career with 85 goals and 53 assists. He graduated in December and enrolled at Pitt for the spring semester. He will play for the Panthers in the fall.</p>
