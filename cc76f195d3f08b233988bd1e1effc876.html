<h1>Plum's defense takes center stage against Hampton</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Most of the talk surrounding Plum’s undefeated start centered around the Mustangs’ explosive offense, which ranked third in Class 4A entering Week 5 with an average of 38.3 points per game.</p>
<p>In a big-time battle Friday at Hampton for first place in the Greater Allegheny Conference, Plum’s defense proved it can be just as powerful, stifling the Talbots (3-2, 3-2) for a pivotal 20-7 win.</p>
<p>Mustangs senior Reed Martin caught five passes for 107 yards and a touchdown and added a 14-yard rush, while junior Logan Brooks caught three passes for 38 yards and scored on a 74-yard run to help Plum seize the momentum early.</p>
<p>With the win, the No. 5 Mustangs (5-0, 5-0) are in the driver’s seat in the race for the conference title, and an undefeated regular season is looking more and more like a possibility. Still, Plum coach Matt Morgan isn’t allowing himself or his players to look too far ahead.</p>
<p>“It’s something we’ve got to take day by day,” Morgan said. “We talk about it every week — we write our own chapters every week, and this was just the next chapter in our book.”</p>
<p>Hubner set the tone for the Mustangs right off the bat with an interception on the first play from scrimmage. He then orchestrated a seven-play, 59-yard scoring drive, capped by a 14-yard touchdown run by sophomore Eryck Moore to put Plum on the board first.</p>
<p>Brooks then took an end-around for a 74-yard touchdown on the first play of the Mustangs’ next possession. He raced past everybody down the left sideline before Hampton senior Gage Galuska sprinted in and attempted to make a diving tackle just before the goal line. But Brooks maintained his balance on his way into the end zone.</p>
<p>“I was excited,” Brooks said. “I thought it was going to go for a touchdown regardless, and it did.</p>
<p>“I was kind of gassed, I’m not even going to lie. I was slowing up, but it still worked out.”</p>
<p>The Talbots put together a couple promising drives in the second quarter but couldn’t come away with any points. Brooks made an interception in the end zone the first time Hampton made it inside the 20, then the Talbots turned it over on downs on their second trip to the red zone, allowing Plum to take a 13-0 lead into the break.</p>
<p>The Mustangs received the second-half kickoff and quickly added to their lead, first appearing to score on a highlight-reel 50-yard touchdown reception by Brooks that was called back for a holding penalty. On the very next play, Martin caught a screen pass from Hubner and went untouched down the left sideline for a 62-yard score, giving Plum a 20-0 lead early in the third quarter.</p>
<p>“I was thinking in my head, ‘Take it to the house,’ ” Martin said. “My teammates had perfect blocks. I just ran right between them and kept running.”</p>
<p>Hampton got on the board late in the third quarter thanks to an impressive 12-play, 74-yard scoring drive, capped by a 1-yard touchdown plunge by senior Joe Liberto, who finished with 68 yards rushing on 21 carries. An injury to starting center Ryan Mankevich, however, cost the Talbots dearly in their attempted comeback.</p>
<p>Several high snaps got away from quarterback Matt DeMatteo after Mankevich left the game, costing Hampton a chance to score on a drive that started at the Mustangs’ 29-yard line after a blocked punt. Both teams traded takeaways in a sloppy final quarter, but Plum’s defense got the job done when it mattered, forcing a late turnover on downs to secure the win.</p>
<p>“It kind of got really ugly there for a while, but whenever you have a pretty solid defense, it kind of accommodates the lack of execution on offense and securing the ball,” Morgan said. “We’ve got to get better with that moving forward, heading into the playoff run here.”</p>
