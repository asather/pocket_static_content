<h1>Dormont woman honored by council for 'CoronaChoir'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There hasn’t been a lot that people could count on during the current COVID-19 pandemic. But for a couple of months, residents of Dormont could rely on neighbors standing in front of their homes every Sunday evening to lift one another’s spirits in song.</p>
<p>The Dormont “CoronaChoir” was organized by Amy Kline in late March after she was inspired by videos of Italian citizens singing from their balconies while on lockdown. She spread news of her idea via social media.</p>
<p>The debut performance of the choir — featuring selections from “Les Miserables” — drew more than 150 community members, who despite their numbers maintained social distancing while singing in front of their homes, on porches, driveways and sidewalks.</p>
<p>Residents continued to take part until May 31.</p>
<p>Ms. Kline was honored for her inspiring effort with a proclamation from the Dormont Borough Council at its Monday meeting.</p>
<p>Council member Joanna Bouldin said, “It was such a joy to see everyone” singing on Sunday nights. “It was just amazing and creative.”</p>
<p>Even though the CoronaChoir is over for now, Ms. Kline has been busy with her next project — organizing a boroughwide art show.</p>
<p>“I’m working with a few people forming this concept of an art show,” she said. The idea is to have community members who may have picked up a new skill or hobby during the COVID-19 lockdown to be able to show off their artwork to the public.</p>
<p>Ms. Kline hopes to be able to display the artwork in the windows of Dormont businesses and online.</p>
<p>Information on the hobby and art show can be found on the CoronaChoir Facebook page at https://​www.facebook.com/​groups/​499568217387343/.</p>
<p>In other COVID-19 matters, borough Manager Ben Estell said cases of the virus are on the rise in Dormont. There were seven cases from March through June, but since the end of June, there have been 11 new cases, bringing the total to 18 as of Monday.</p>
<p>“Allegheny County is seeing a very large increase” in cases, Mr. Estell said. “Please wear a mask.”</p>
