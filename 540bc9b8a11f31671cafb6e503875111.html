<h1>The playground? The library? The museum? With schools closed for COVID-19, where can kids go?</h1>

<p>When Joe Aracri, system chair of pediatrics for Allegheny Health Network, explains why drastic precautions are recommended even without a single confirmed case of COVID-19 in Allegheny County, he uses a hockey analogy.</p>
<p>“They’re not going to where the puck is,” he said. “They’re trying to stop the puck from going somewhere else. They’re trying to get ahead of it.”</p>
<p>What that means, in practical terms, is not to send a kid to hockey practice.</p>
<p>With all school districts in Pennsylvania shutting down for 10 days starting Monday —&nbsp;and some choosing to close for at least a month —&nbsp;parents are scrambling to figure out what activities are both safe and responsible. Can kids have playdates? Go to a playground? Hike in the woods? Eat at a restaurant?</p>
<p>First, Dr. Aracri recommends framing the issue to children as one of prevention.</p>
<p>“Children are terrified now, and a lot of adults are terrified too,” he said. “Your school gets canceled, all your stuff gets cancelled, kids will take that and blow it out of proportion like you won’t believe.</p>
<p>“This is all to prevent disease —&nbsp;not because of the disease.”</p>
<p>It’s become a well-known maxim in times of crisis to quote Mister Rogers: “Look for the helpers.” In this case, with the on-screen version of Mister Rogers (actor Tom Hanks) actually diagnosed with COVID-19, it’s the kids who are the helpers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Social distancing with kids</strong></p>
<p>To help, social distancing is the best weapon against the spread of COVID-19 —&nbsp;defined as keeping six feet away from another person.&nbsp;Children experience much less severe symptoms from COVID-19 than older people, though they can carry and spread the virus.</p>
<p>And wherever social distancing can be practiced, kids can go.&nbsp;“We don’t have to go crazy,” said Dr. Aracri. “We just want to be careful.”</p>
<p>A few examples: Going to a library to check out a book “while monitoring hand hygiene” would be fine, said John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases for UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, though he wouldn’t recommend participating in a library story time with a group of children. Some libraries, such as the Cranberry Public Library, announced Friday that they would close temporarily.</p>
<p>Similarly, “A small playground with lots of young children touching surfaces is probably not a great idea,” said Dr. Williams. “Young kids just aren’t developmentally able to think about where they put their hands and keeping them cleaned often.”</p>
<p>A quieter playground or a park large enough to have space in between children is perfectly acceptable, he said, as is a hike in the woods or a backyard.</p>
<p><strong>What about playdates?</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Aracri said that small playdates are fine, as long as none of the children are sick.</p>
<p>At this time, he would consider even just a runny nose in a child to be a reason to keep them at home. “COVID-19 in kids is very mild —&nbsp;most kids get it and don’t even know they have it,” he said. “During this time, I would say it’s better to be overly cautious.”</p>
<p>A crowded museum with lots of “touching” exhibits should be avoided, said Dr. Aracri, though one where a child could hold a parent’s hand and just observe would be acceptable. The Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh announced Friday that it is temporarily closing because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>As for sports, he said, it would depend on the size of the team and the location. An outdoor soccer practice for teenagers is different than a crowded preschool gymnastics class.</p>
<p>“Outside events are usually a lot safer —&nbsp;as long as everyone on the team is well, they should be OK,” he said. “An indoor event I would probably avoid.”</p>
<p>That said, many outdoor practices are being canceled —&nbsp;especially as schools close their facilities. “Close physical contact is usually involved even for ‘non-contact sports,’” said Dr. Williams.</p>
<p>Dr. Aracri said that families can go out to eat but cautioned against something like a McDonald’s PlayPlace or a buffet.</p>
<p><strong>Should you travel with kids?</strong></p>
<p>From his own patients, Dr. Aracri has heard a lot of questions about travel. He is not advising them to cancel spring break trips, even if they involve an airplane, but instead to practice hand washing and social distancing as much as possible. He recommends that children sit in window seats to distance them from other passengers.</p>
<p>Within the home, however, all social distancing is off.</p>
<p>“You take care of your kids, you love them, you do what you need to do,” he said. “Those kids need to be hugged.”</p>
<p>That does not extend to elderly relatives. “We’re not going to kiss Grandma on the face,” he said.</p>
<p>To keep kids busy indoors, Dr. Williams recommended trying to stay active, with dance parties or toys such as a mini trampoline. It may also be a good time for kids to prioritize contact with grandparents and other friends or relatives through FaceTime or Skype,</p>
<p>And if all else fails, said Dr. Aracri, “break out the Xbox.”</p>
