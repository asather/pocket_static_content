<p>Human remains were found Tuesday during the search for a missing soldier stationed at Fort Hood in Texas, Army officials told CNN.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/vanessa-guillen-missing-soldier-reward-baby-bash-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">Vanessa Guillen</a>, 20, has been missing since April. She was last seen in the parking lot of her barracks at the post on April 22, according to the US Army Criminal Investigation Command.</p>
<p>Investigators had "returned to an area of interest close to the Leon River, Bell County, Texas, for more investigative work" and discovered partial human remains, the Army CID said.</p>
<p>Authorities said the identity of the remains have not been confirmed.</p>
<p>The remains were found in a shallow grave and search operations have been suspended, pending identification, Tim Miller, the director and founder of Texas EquuSearch, told CNN.</p>
<p>Miller said the discovery was made approximately 26 miles from the site where earlier in June authorities found the remains of Gregory Wedel-Morales, a soldier who went missing last year while driving his car in Killeen.</p>
<p>While it's unclear whether there's a connection between Guillen and the remains, an attorney representing the soldier's family said her clients were heartbroken and continue to call for the truth about the soldier's disappearance.</p>
<p>"Our hearts are broken. We feel pain, frustration and devastation. This shouldn't have happened. We demand a congressional investigation. We demand the truth," attorney Natalie Khawam told CNN in a statement. "If this could happen to Vanessa, this can happen to any one of our sisters, daughters and mothers."</p>
<p>Guillen, a private first class, was last seen wearing a black T-shirt and purple fitness-type pants, according to the Army CID. Her car keys, room key, identification card and wallet were later found in the armory room where she was working earlier that day.</p>
<p>Guillen is described as 5 feet 2 inches, 126 pounds with black hair and brown eyes, according to the Army CID statement.</p>
