<h1>Artist Olek arrested for defiant trespass at museum </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Agata Oleksiak, a Polish fiber artist, was arrested Wednesday evening at the Mattress Factory after refusing to leave the contemporary art museum on the North Side.</p>
<p>Ms. Oleksiak, 41, who goes by the name Olek, came to Pittsburgh last month to be an artist in residence at the museum, but Mattress Factory leaders revoked her invitation after a Feb 2 altercation with a guest at a private party in the museum’s lobby.&nbsp;Hayley Haldeman, the museum’s interim director, gave Ms. Oleksiak a letter stating that she was not to return to the museum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, Ms. Oleksiak set a blanket down in the building’s vestibule and laid out her artwork, which consisted of crocheted penises, according to museum spokeswoman Mandy Wilson.</p>
<p>The artist offered to sell the fiber artwork to patrons arriving for a program featuring the work of artist Nathan Hall,&nbsp;a composer and musician who focuses on intimacy and kink.</p>
<p>Ms. Haldeman asked Ms. Oleksiak to leave but the artist refused so she called police. Police tried to persuade her to leave but she refused, Ms. Wilson said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Oleksiak&nbsp;was arrested, handcuffed and charged with defiant trespass, a misdemeanor. She spent the night in the Allegheny County Jail and has a court hearing scheduled for Feb. 19.</p>
