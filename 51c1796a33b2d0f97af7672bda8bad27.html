<p>ST. LOUIS – Kris Letang had one of the best seats in the house Friday at Enterprise Center and could only chuckle when Montreal’s Shea Weber ripped a 106.5-mph slap shot to win the hardest shot contest in the NHL All-Star skills competition.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I love that,” the blue-liner said. “I love to watch it. It’s definitely fun.”</p>
<p>Letang remembers tuning in as a kid to watch Al MacInnis and Al Iafrate challenge the laws of physics with stiff wooden sticks during All-Star weekends past. He still marvels at modern-day sledgehammers like Shea Weber and Zdeno Chara.</p>
<p>But he doesn’t expect to be invited to compete in that contest anytime soon.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’m a guy that has a good slap shot,” the 32-year-old lamented.</p>
<p>So far this season, only five NHL players have scored more goals on slap shots than Letang, who has five on 44 attempts. But he estimates that he uncorks his composite stick at full velocity on a slapper once every five or six games.</p>
<p>“Because guys are so much faster,” he said. “They get closer to you quicker.”</p>
<p>The use of slap shots has steadily declined over the past decade. In 2008, when Letang made his NHL debut, about 29% of the league’s shots were slap shots, according to data compiled by The Athletic. Last season, that figure was down to 14.5%. Meanwhile, players took nearly four times as many wrist shots.</p>
<p>While slap shots have been leaned into less and less over the years, Letang has continued to use them at a similar frequency – roughly one per game.</p>
<p>Given his longevity, they all add up. He has taken 593 slappers since 2009-10, tops on the Penguins and 22nd among all NHL players. But that is far from the league lead. Chicago’s Duncan Keith has bombed more than twice as many.</p>
<p>Letang has scored 33 goals on slap shots during his fine career. This season, his slapper has been more effective than ever. His 11.9 shooting percentage on slap shots would be a career high, beating his current best of 9.2% in 2017-18.</p>
<p>Asked if he is doing anything differently, he shrugged. “I didn’t even know.”</p>
<p>Letang, who says his slap shot has never been officially timed, is usually more worried about shot placement than velocity when he takes them in games. During his windup, he is subconsciously calculating where to aim, how much to put on a shot and what obstacles stand between him and the other team’s goalie.</p>
<p>The worst-case scenario is a blocked shot and a breakaway the other way.</p>
<p>“You don’t really think about it when you’ve been playing the game for so long,” the six-time All-Star said. “A slap shot will come if you have more time. If you have less time, you usually go with a half-slapper or a wrist shot. It depends.”</p>
<p>Teammate Evgeni Malkin, the only Penguins player with more career slap-shot goals, is more likely to make the highlight shows with a one-time blast on a power play. But Letang is adept at getting slap shots through to the net where someone like Patric Hornqvist is parked, ready to tip it or whack away at a rebound.</p>
<p>“Geno has a great one-timer. He has a great shot all the way around,” Letang said. “I’m just a better shooter when I do a half-slapper. I’m more accurate.”</p>
<p>While still a weapon for the Penguins, his “half-slapper” won’t get Letang in the NHL’s hardest shot contest. In years past, Letang competed in NHL All-Star skills competition events such as the shooting accuracy contest and skating races. This year, Letang made only a cameo in the “Save Streak” goalie competition.</p>
<p>The hardest shot contest remains a highlight for Letang anyway. He watched from near the bench as Weber and Washington’s John Carlson punished pucks Friday.</p>
<p>He believes, as the NHL evolves, we’ll see that less and less in actual games.</p>
<p>“I think one-timers, if you consider that a slap shot, they’re always going to be there,” Letang said. “But it’s probably going to go down because guys are so much faster, so quick to get out there. And guys wear more protection to block shots also. Maybe it’s going to be more about trying to beat a guy one-on-one.”</p>
