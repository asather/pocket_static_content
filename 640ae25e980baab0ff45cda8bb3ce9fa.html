<p>Two children were removed from a Wilkinsburg home at different times Wednesday morning after each was found unresponsive, according to Allegheny County police.</p>
<p>Wilkinsburg police were called to a home on Franklin Avenue at 7:35 a.m. after a five-year-old girl was not responsive. Once there, officers discovered that another child — a five-year-old boy — was taken by ambulance to the hospital around 1:45 a.m. when he was found unresponsive. One child is in critical condition. The other is in stable condition.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh firefighters responded to the scene to investigate for carbon monoxide and reported that the test results were negative.</p>
<p>Police said there were “no obvious signs of trauma,” and said detectives are working with hospital staff and the county crime lab to determine what caused the children to become unresponsive.</p>
<p>Anyone with information concerning this incident is asked to call the Allegheny County Police tip line at 1-833-ALL-TIPS (1-833-255-8477). Callers can remain anonymous.</p>
