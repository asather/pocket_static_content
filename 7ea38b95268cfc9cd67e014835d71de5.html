<h1>Investigators believe Nova Scotia mass shooting started as a domestic violence dispute</h1>

<p>After searching for answers for days following a mass shooting that left at least 22 people dead, investigators believe the rampage in Nova Scotia may have began as a domestic violence dispute.</p>
<p>Canadian law enforcement officials said Gabriel Wortman burned his house down before heading to his ex-partner’s residence and killing people who lived there. Dead bodies were found outside near the home, investigators said. However, it is still unclear if Wortman’s ex-partner was among those killed.</p>
<p>A “chaotic scene” followed when officers arrived and led to a 12-hour manhunt while Wortman attacked people at random and burned several more homes “to the ground,” according to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Chief Superintendent Chris Leather. Wortman was shot and killed by officers at a gas station nearly 60 miles away from Portapique, where the massacre started.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the RCMP revised the death toll to 22 but maintained that additional victims could be found, possibly in one or more of the burned down properties.</p>
<p>Investigators pointed to the “complexity of the tactics involved in this incident, specifically the impersonation of law enforcement with both a vehicle and a uniform, the use of fire as an additional weapon during the shooting, and the high number of fatalities,” as reason to believe Wortman had devoted serious planning to his plot.</p>
<p>“As a country, in moments like these, we come together to support one another," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. "Together we will mourn with the families of the victims, and help them get through this difficult time.”</p>
