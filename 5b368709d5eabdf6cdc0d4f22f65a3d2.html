<h1>Turtle Creek felon pleads guilty to fentanyl, heroin conspiracy with his sisters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Turtle Creek man indicted in 2017 in a heroin and cocaine conspiracy with his two sisters admitted his guilt Thursday in federal court and is facing many years in federal prison.</p>
<p>Jerry Coker, 28, pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fentanyl and heroin.</p>
<p>Coker admitted that on Sept. 11, 2016, his sister Marleka Robinson obtained a large amount of fentanyl from a dealer in Knoxville at his request. She came back to the house she shared with him and another sister, Monique Robinson.</p>
<p>Law officers investigating Coker then executed a search warrant on the home the next day and seized more than 285 grams of fentanyl and smaller amounts of heroin, cocaine and marijuana.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the house was strewn with materials for drug packaging and distributing along with two guns and nearly $9,000 in cash. Federal agents and police seized all of it.</p>
<p>A grand jury indicted Coker and his sisters in November 2017.</p>
<p>The cases against the women are pending.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Cathy Bissoon said she'd sentence Coker on May 18. Because of a prior felony conviction, he faces at least a decade in prison and could get life.</p>
