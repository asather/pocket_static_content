<h1>'Are we going to bet on horses or are we going to bet on our kids?'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One didn’t need much horse sense to know that Gov. Tom Wolf had picked a tough fight as he began a statewide tour Wednesday promoting his proposed $204 million&nbsp;scholarship fund for students attending the 14 state-owned universities.</p>
<p>Funding those need-based&nbsp;scholarships by taking dollars from the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development Trust Fund potentially puts him at odds not only with Republican lawmakers and some Democrats, but an industry within Agriculture that boasts revered names like “Smarty Jones,” the iconic racing horse and Kentucky Derby winner bred in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The horse's owner, Pat Chapman, of Annville, Lebanon County, already has blasted the fund diversion idea. The comments came in a statement released by the Pennsylvania Equine Coalition last Tuesday, even as the governor was before the General Assembly in Harrisburg unveiling the scholarship plan in his 2020-21 proposed Commonwealth budget.</p>
<p>"If the governor goes through with this proposal, the end is near for my breeding and racing days in the state of Pennsylvania and for many others," the owner said.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday, Gov. Wolf said a far larger principle is at stake for Pennsylvania’s 12.8 million residents — namely, the ability to educate future generations without crippling debt, and in the process, keep them in Pennsylvania to help drive the economy.</p>
<p>“We have to make some tough decisions sometimes in politics,’ the governor told his audience at Lock Haven University. “Are we going to bet on horses or are we going to bet on our kids? I’m going to bet on our kids.”</p>
<p>He said data shows 60 percent of future jobs will require higher education, but right now, far too many lower and middle-income families find campus out of financial reach.</p>
<p>His midday appearance was the first of 14 campus trips he plans to make across the State System of Higher Education touting the scholarships for those lower and middle income families. The awards would pay for campus costs not covered by other financial aid and would require students to stay in Pennsylvania each year they receive the award.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the scholarship converts to a loan.</p>
<p>Pennsylvanians graduate with the second highest debt in the nation, said Mr. Wolf,&nbsp; assuming costs do not drive them from campus short of a degree. Though it’s the state’s least expensive university option, debt-load across the State System averages $34,039, forcing graduates saddled with it to delay buying homes knowing they are one emergency away from bankruptcy, the governor said.</p>
<p>Those $391-a-month student loan payments “could instead be spent on things that would help our economy,” Mr. Wolf said.</p>
<p>“These are the people who are going to become our doctors, our teachers, our professors. They’re going to design our buildings,” he said. “They’re going to fly our planes.</p>
<p>“This is our future, folks,” he added.</p>
<p>The State System enrolls nearly 96,000 students on its campuses, which in Western Pennsylvania include California, Clarion, Edinboro, Indiana and Slippery Rock universities. Base average in-state tuition, not counting room and board, is $7,716 a year.</p>
<p>At Lock Haven, the governor spoke inside the Parsons Union Building beside a sign touting the Nelly Bly Scholarship Program, named for Pennsylvanian and journalist of the late 1800s, herself driven from college by costs</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf was flanked by Lock Haven President&nbsp;Robert Pignatello and senior Kalista Swartz, a psychology major and first generation student who qualified for a Pell Grant and institutional aid but still faces considerable debt.</p>
<p>“Everyone regardless of their economic background deserves a shot at college,” said Ms. Swartz, from&nbsp;Richfield, a community in Juniata and Snyder counties.</p>
<p>The Wolf administration says families earning up to $75,000 would be eligible at that&nbsp; at least&nbsp; 25,000 students would qualify. However, decisions are still begin made about whether scholarships would cover room and board as well as tuition, thus reducing the number of students served by about half.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said transferring $204 million would still leave the Horse Race Development Trust Fund with nearly $50 million, an amount he said is more than double New Jersey’s fund.</p>
<p>But opponents said it nonetheless would do irreparable harm, devastating a $1.6 billion horse race and breeding industry, affecting farmers, veterinarians, mushroom growers and others.</p>
<p>On Sunday, opponents&nbsp; mobilized, turning a planned stallion show in Lebanon County into a rally against the fund diversion.</p>
<p>“While we’re not critical of the governor’s support of education, we can’t kill an industry to achieve the goal,”&nbsp; Todd Mostoller, executive director of the Pennsylvania Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, told rally-goers at Equistar Farm.</p>
<p>Even before the governor took the podium Wednesday, the coalition warned that the diversion would devastate family farms, cost 20,000 jobs and with it investment in the economy.</p>
<p>It quoted&nbsp; Randy Brungard, whose family owns the 360-acre Brungard Farm in Howard, Pa., Centre County. They breed and raise 22 thoroughbred horses.</p>
<p>“You don’t rob hard working families to give money away to those who have not earned it.”</p>
<p>The governor’s office did not respond when asked about the time frame of the visits to all 14 schools.&nbsp;</p>
