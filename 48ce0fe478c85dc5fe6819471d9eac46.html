<h1>McMurray couple turn 8-day climb of Mount Killmanjaro into fundraiser</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The 15 minutes that David and Brenda Tenison, of McMurray, stood atop the summit of the highest mountain in Africa on Dec. 29, 2019, was the culmination of a 40-year dream for Mr. Tenison.</p>
<p>His wife’s motivation for climbing Mount Kilimanjaro was far more grounded.</p>
<p>“I decided I could either stay home and worry, or go with him,” she said.</p>
<p>The couple has turned the eight-day adventure into a fundraiser for the 160-bed homeless shelter of City Mission, 84 W. Wheeling St., Washington, of which Mr. Tenison is the chairman of the board of directors. The couple is hoping to raise $5,000.</p>
<p>“The actual climb is step by step for days on end.&nbsp;For our clients, recovery from addiction can be minute by minute at first, and then day by day,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Tenison, 60, is general manager of the Perryman Company in Houston, Washington County. Mrs. Tenison, 46, volunteers at City Mission, Jubilee Christian School, Bible Chapel, and Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix.</p>
<p>The nearly lifelong quest began for Mr. Tenison as a young man winter mountaineering in Mount Washington, N.H., and climbing the Seneca Rocks in West Virginia and others.</p>
<p>“Usually a challenge is mental or physical. This is both,” he said of its appeal.</p>
<p>As his 60th birthday approached, he decided to reach for the stars.</p>
<p>“I wanted to challenge myself to be in shape to climb a 19,341-feet mountain,” he said.</p>
<p>Mount Kilimanjaro was chosen as it is Africa’s highest mountain, and the highest freestanding volcano/mountain in the world, having been built on volcanic eruptions 2.5 million years ago.</p>
<p>Traveling to Africa would also mark the fifth continent the couple visited together, with only Antarctica and Australia remaining to fulfill another of their goals.</p>
<p>Their first step of the trip was the planning, during which Mr. Tenison underwent hip surgery to be able to make the climb. After that, the couple began physical training for a year, hiking locally in 10- to 20-pound weighted vests to intensify the workout and simulate carrying backpacks.</p>
<p>“This adventure was originally my husband’s, but it quickly became my own, and I wanted to summit Mount Kilimanjaro as well,” Mrs. Tenison said.</p>
<p>The couple arrived in Tanzania on Dec. 23. In the distance loomed the massive, snow-capped, rugged landform towering into the clouds.</p>
<p>“You can look at it and be completely put off – how will I ever do that? Or, you can say, ‘one step at a time I will get to the top and accomplish my goal,’” Mrs. Tenison said.</p>
<p>“I felt ‘this will be great,’” said Mr. Tenison, who video recorded much of the trip.</p>
<p>Their journey began the next day in a rain forest at 8,500 feet. They were accompanied by two guides and 11 porters, the latter who carried tents, food, toilets and more.</p>
<p>While there are seven paths to the summit, the Tenisons chose the longer one for altitude adjustment, or acclimatization.</p>
<p>They traveled four miles in two-and-a-half hours in rain and mud. The next day they covered seven miles and 4,000 feet on the Shira Plateau trekking through water flowing down from the mountain.</p>
<p>“‘Pole Pole,’ which means ‘slowly slowly’ in Swahili, was our motto from the guides,” Mrs. Tenison said.</p>
<p>While the entire trail is 43 miles, it sometimes required going up 1,000 feet, and then down 1,000 feet.</p>
<p>They slept in a tent city camp with hundreds of other climbers.</p>
<p>“Climb high and sleep low,” is the mountaineering rule for getting used to the altitude, Mr. Tenison said.</p>
<p>The weather became progressively colder and windier the higher they climbed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tenison said Day 5 was the most challenging for the two-hour steep rock climbing of the 900-foot Barranco Wall, which she did not anticipate.</p>
<p>“I was terrified, but the guides were fantastic,’’ she recalled.&nbsp;“Now that I did that, I can do anything.’’</p>
<p>On “summit day’ they started out at midnight as it was safer with the rock frozen solid, and morning was more likely to yield a clear summit for viewing.</p>
<p>Head lamps on their hats steered their trek of six inches at a time.</p>
<p>“When I saw the pink of the sunrise I knew we were close.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was all I needed to keep going,” Mrs. Tenison said.</p>
<p>At 5:30 a.m., they set foot on the summit.</p>
<p>“There are no words,” Mrs. Tenison could be seen mouthing on the video of the top-of-Africa view and the experience of getting there.</p>
<p>They could only remain for 15 minutes as, at 19,000-feet, there is half the oxygen of sea level, which also makes the 15-degree temperature feel much colder.</p>
<p>The six-day ascent was following by a two-day descent off the mountain. Both agreed they would do it all over again.</p>
<p>The couple concluded their African adventure with a six-day safari in Tanzania of the Serengeti and Ngorongoro wildlife conservation areas.</p>
<p>The Tenisons said working so hard to make their dream of a successful climb a reality makes it the perfect fundraiser for City Mission.</p>
<p>“It takes determination, persistence and training to climb a mountain,” Mr. Tenison said.</p>
<p>“We feel there are a lot of parallels between doing this and the road to recovery,” Mrs. Tenison said.</p>
