<h1>Kennedy's Ashley Marina will not be singing in the next round of 'America's Got Talent'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In reality television, it’s possible to be loved, yet lost.</p>
<p>Kennedy Township’s Ashley Marina, 12, will not be advancing to the live shows on NBC’s&nbsp;“America’s Got Talent.” The singer/songwriter who came back to impress even Simon Cowell earlier this year was part of Tuesday night’s Judge Cuts episode.</p>
<p>Talking to the panel via streamed interview on a gigantic screen, Ashley was given the bad news by Howie Mandel.</p>
<p>“I want to tell you that this decision was not unanimous,” he said.&nbsp;“And this is really hard for me to say but for now, it’s a&nbsp;‘no.’”</p>
<p>Heidi Klum immediately chimed in:&nbsp;“Don’t give up because you’re great, OK?’” Sofia Vergara, the fourth judge, said she agreed.</p>
<p>Earlier in the show when&nbsp;“AGT” raced through video clips from 100 auditions, Vergara, who is married to Mt. Lebanon native Joe Manganiello, saw Ashley and remarked&nbsp;“I want to clap again for her.”</p>
