<h1>Speckled Egg cracks open Downtown, as does Bae Bae's Cafe</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rare are the places that a Downtown office drone can get both their morning jolt of caffeine and take the edge off with a happy hour nip and a hearty if not healthy breakfast and lunch in between.</p>
<p>But that’s just the idea at The Speckled Egg, which opened officially Monday morning in the lobby of Downtown’s opulent 102-year old Union Trust Building after a brief soft opening last week. It is the newest dining and drinking option at the landmark 11-floor office tower, which was constructed in 1917 by industrialist Henry Clay Frick.</p>
<p>Jacqueline and Nate Schoedel aren’t yet 30 (she’s 28, he’s 29) but already are a pair of Pittsburgh-area restaurant veterans and an aspiring culinary power couple.</p>
<p>“I’m happy to surprise people and I’m happy to give them good food Downtown,” she said of the menu at their 40-seat restaurant which includes everything from fresh juice elixirs ($6) to poppy seed pancakes ($10) to whole-grain avocado toast ($8) to a Turkey Devonshire ($12).</p>
<p>“It’s a bunch of stuff that Nate and I like to eat and it’s the kind of stuff that you want to eat to start your day and then keep going [throughout],” she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Schoedel said that the couple’s dream is to eventually open a diner, and customers at The Speckled Egg could “expect everything you can at an all-American diner. The food will feel good going down but also after you eat it, too. They call diners greasy spoons for a reason. This will have that same warmth, but you’ll be able to feel good afterward. You won't need a nap.”</p>
<p>Local products abound: they’ll serve Commonplace Coffee and cocktails with Maggie’s Farm Rum; breads, bagels and croissants come from Mediterra; muffins and scones are from Threefifty Bakery; bacon is from Heritage Craft Butchers; and pies, cookies and cakes are from Hillrun Bakery, and gluten-free products from Gluten Free Goat.</p>
<p>A native of Youngstown, Ohio, Ms. Schoedel came to Pittsburgh in 2010 to attend culinary school and most recently was the executive chef at Mediterra Bakehouse in Sewickley. She was part of the inaugural class of chefs at the Strip District’s Smallman Galley. She also has worked at Mount Washington’s bygone Isabela on Grandview and appeared on season eight of the Food Network series “Cutthroat Kitchen.”</p>
<p>Mr. Schoedel grew up in South Park and has worked in management and kitchen positions at Muddy Waters in East Liberty, Gaucho Parrilla in the Strip and was part of the field crew at Rivendale Farms in Washington County.</p>
<p>The Speckled Egg opens at 7 a.m. Monday through Friday, and weekend brunch hours are in the offing.</p>
<p>Also Downtown: Bae Bae’s Cafe has opened in the former Toonseum space at 945 Liberty Ave., four doors down from flagship Bae Bae’s Kitchen. The pocket-sized cafe offers specialty tea, coffee, milk and juice drinks as well as smoothies, soups and sandwiches for eat in and takeway.</p>
