<h1>Meet Brennan Malone and Liover Peguero, the Pirates' return in the Starling Marte trade</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Starling Marte has been traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Brennan Malone and Liover Peguero. Here’s a brief scouting report on the two prospects, a pitcher and shortstop, respectively.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Brennan Malone, pitcher —</strong> At just 19, he’s really young and therefore lacks much in the way of a professional track record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Diamondbacks drafted him with the third pick in the second round — No. 33 overall — in the MLB draft this past June. They invested a lot in him, too, by signing him to a bonus of&nbsp;$2,202,200 out of IMG Academy, located near the Pirates’ spring training home in Bradenton, Fla.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously a University of North Carolina commit, the righty signed in enough time to pitch in seven games professionally with Arizona’s rookie and short-season affiliates, posting a 4.50 ERA and eight strikeouts across eight innings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numerous outlets — including ESPN, MLB.com, Baseball America and Fangraphs —&nbsp;ranked him among the top 25 players available in his draft. At the time of the trade, he was ranked No. 9 in the Diamondbacks system.</p>
<p>He’s best known for his fastball and is generally projected as a power arm. <a href="http://m.mlb.com/prospects/2019?list=ari" target="_blank">MLB.com</a> breaks down his repertoire this way:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The North Carolina native who moved to IMG for his senior year of high school has the makings of four solid pitches and improved consistency in using them throughout a start. He regularly runs his fastball up to 96 mph and has shown an ability to maintain that velocity deeper into starts this spring. He now features two distinct breaking pitches, with a plus slider a big reason for his step forward. It's a true out pitch and it's better than his average curve, which is a bigger 11-to-5 breaker when he maintains his high three-quarter arm slot. He has feel for his changeup, though he can slow his arm a bit on it at times.</em></p>
<p>That scouting report matches up well with his formidable 6-foot-4, 204-pound frame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some highlights from his appearance in the 2018&nbsp;Perfect Game National Showcase.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Liover Peguero, shortstop —</strong> He’s even younger than Malone, having just turned 19 on New Year’s Eve, though his professional track record is a little bit longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since signing with Arizona for&nbsp;$475,000 out of the Dominican Republic in 2017, he’s appeared in 101 games at the Dominican Summer League, rookie and short-season levels, hitting .299 with a .354 on-base percentage and .428 slugging percentage, good for a .781 OPS. He’s also stolen 18 bases and smacked five homers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MLB.com ranks him as the Diamondbacks’ 18th-best prospect. And though he measures just 6-foot-1 and 160 pounds, the publication likes his ability to make an impact offensively.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Peguero has the chance to be a special hitter. He has an impactful swing from the right side of the plate, with plus bat speed that enables him to smash good velocity and make consistent barreled contact, and it's easy to envision him developing some game power as he adds strength to his projectable frame. He has an advanced approach for a teenager and already shows the ability to recognize spin and control the strike zone, with his plus speed that aids him on both sides of the ball.</em></p>
<p>As for his glove, MLB.com likes the progress he’s made and believes he has the physical skills to manage at the position, though his bat could allow him to play in other positions, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September, he helped his Hillsboro Hops to a win in the Northwest League playoffs by smacking a game-winning two-run double in the bottom of the ninth inning against the&nbsp;Salem-Keizer Volcanoes.&nbsp;</p>
