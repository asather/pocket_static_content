<h1>The best and worst of the 'Dancing With the Stars' premiere</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Does it shock you to know that the “Dancing With the Stars” premiere included a Carole Baskin controversy?</p>
<p>It shouldn’t. Baskin was clearly cast on the ABC competition series because she is a headline magnet. She became one of 2020’s breakout stars this spring when she emerged as the villain of “Tiger King,” Netflix’s enormously popular docuseries about feuding big cat owners.</p>
<p>Baskin has said the show destroyed her reputation; it repeated rumors that she killed her ex-husband, Don Lewis (who went missing in 1997), and fed him to tigers. Baskin calls this “the most ludicrous of all the lies.”</p>
<p>Although the internet ran wild with this allegation, creating countless memes and jokes, the Lewis family does not find the frenzy amusing. To remind people that they still don’t have answers about his disappearance, they bought ad time in multiple TV markets during “Dancing With the Stars” on Monday to ask for tips and information. They offered a $100,000 reward.</p>
<p>“Do you know who did this or if Carole Baskin was involved?” the family’s attorney asks, surrounded by Lewis’ daughters and former assistant. The commercial started making the rounds on social media and Baskin became a worldwide trending topic. Incidentally, Baskin (who danced the paso doble to “Eye of the Tiger") had the lowest scores of any contestant on opening night.</p>
<p>Here’s our ranking of all 15 pairs from the pandemic-era premiere, which featured an audience-free ballroom, new host Tyra Banks and judges Bruno Tonioli, Carrie Ann Inaba and Derek Hough:</p>
<p>1) Skai Jackson and Alan Bersten (tango, judge scores: 7, 7, 7 for a total of 21 out of 30 points). The&nbsp;18-year-old actress from&nbsp;Disney Channel shows “Jessie” and “Bunk’d” is&nbsp;the youngest contestant by far, which can be intimidating. Can she overcome her nerves?</p>
<p>Jackson has a shot to become one of the youngest winners ever as she dazzled everyone in her first performance. Bruno admired her mature attitude and Derek declared the sky’s the limit. Carrie Ann calls it a “beautiful and exciting” dance, and says that if she and Bersten can work around their height difference, they could be serious competitors.</p>
<p>2) Kaitlyn Bristowe and Artem Chigvintsev (cha-cha, judge scores: 6, 7, 7 for a total of 20 points). Bristowe, 35, was a “Bachelor” contestant who landed her own season of “The Bachelorette” in 2015. She says her&nbsp;longtime dream is to be a dancer. Can she live out her dream and win the show?</p>
<p>The judges were blown away and offered very specific critiques about her form, which is a surefire way to tell they consider her a true contender. Bruno went with “brilliant,” while Carrie Ann and Derek said it’s a terrific start for the first show.</p>
<p>3) Justina Machado and Sasha Farber (cha-cha, judge scores: 7, 7, 7 for a total of 21 points). Machado, 48, is best known for&nbsp;Netflix-turned-Pop-TV’s “One Day at a Time” and also starred in “Jane the Virgin” and “Six Feet Under.” She said she knows she’s not a professional dancer and just wants to have fun. Can she stay stress-free throughout the competition?</p>
<p>Machado may be self-deprecating about her dance skills, but she looked like she’s having a blast, and Bruno was already out of his seat cheering when she finished. “The confidence, the musicality!” he raved. Carrie Ann adores her and Derek said she filled the room with energy and “oozes charisma.”</p>
<p>4) Jeannie Mai and Brandon Armstrong (salsa, judge scores: 6, 6, 6 for a total of 18 points). The&nbsp;41-year-old stylist and TV personality is one of the co-hosts of “The Real.”&nbsp;She acknowledges she’s out of her comfort zone and wants to prove to herself that she can do anything. Will it work?</p>
<p>Bruno immediately loved her performance, raving that she’s radiant and an all-around “ray of sunshine.” Carrie Ann agreed and Derek is impressed, but they all critiqued her balance issues.</p>
<p>5) Johnny Weir and Britt Stewart (cha-cha, judge scores: 6, 6, 6 for a total of 18 points). The&nbsp;Olympic figure skater, TV commentator (often with Tara Lipinski) and fashion icon is counting on the fact that figure skating utilizes some of the same skill sets as ballroom dancing. Can he succeed?</p>
<p>Derek was a fan, but said Weir gets in his head too much. Bruno complimented his “wonderful, lyrical” quality, but said he should try to hit his steps more sharply. Carrie Ann declared that Johnny plus “DWTS” equals heaven, but she added that he needs some improvement to stay in the game.</p>
<p>6) Vernon Davis and Peta Murgatroyd (fox trot, judge scores: 5, 6, 6 for a total of 17 points). Davis, 36, is an&nbsp;NFL star who played for the San Francisco 49ers for almost a decade, won a Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos and retired in February. He’s used to dancing in the end zone. Can it translate to the ballroom?</p>
<p>Carrie Ann was impressed with his charisma and stage presence, but noted that he needs to work on a few things. Derek was surprised at the former tight end’s skills and Bruno raved over their “sizzling” chemistry.</p>
<p>7) Monica Aldama and Val Chmerkovskiy (fox trot, judge scores: 6, 7, 6 for a total of 19 points). Aldama, 50, is the head coach of the Navarro College cheerleading team in Texas who became famous in the Netflix docuseries “Cheer.”&nbsp;She’s used to coaching other athletes. Will she have trouble being coached?</p>
<p>Derek called her a breath of fresh air. Bruno agreed she nailed the dance, although he had some critiques for her arms. Carrie Ann acknowledged the fox trot is a tough dance, especially for the first night, but said it was clear that Monica put in a ton of effort.</p>
<p>8) Nev Schulman and Jenna Johnson (fox trot, judge scores: 7, 7, 6 for a total of 20 points). The&nbsp;35-year-old host of MTV’s “Catfish” helps people who suspect they are being duped in online relationships, but he’s very much not a dancer. Will that be a problem?</p>
<p>Carrie Ann deemed the dance “incredible” and “refined.” Derek proclaimed him a “great dancer,” although he said he needs to work on his frame. Bruno wasn’t as enthusiastic but offered a semi-positive critique.</p>
<p>9) Jesse Metcalfe and Sharna Burgess (quickstep, judge scores: 6, 6, 6 for a total of 18 points). Metcalfe, 41, is best known as the frequently shirtless gardener on ABC’s “Desperate Housewives" and now stars in Hallmark series “Chesapeake Shores.” He has no dance experience but feels like he could win the whole show. Is that realistic?</p>
<p>Definitely cast in the “hunk” role, he won gushes from the judges over his chemistry with Burgess. Bruno announced that he “got me into gardening.” Carrie Ann called the performance “a little wild” and cautioned him to watch his posture, but she liked that it had way more passion than you usually see in a quickstep.</p>
<p>10) Nelly and Daniella Karagach (salsa, judge scores: 5, 5, 6 for a total of 16 points). Nelly, 45, is a Grammy-winning rapper who blew up the charts in the early 2000s with “Country Grammar,” “Hot in Herre” and “Dilemma” featuring Kelly Rowland.&nbsp;He’s used to dancing onstage. Can he adjust to this stage?</p>
<p>Producers chose Nelly’s own “Ride Wit Me,” and he acknowledged that he had never performed the salsa to one of his songs before. He ended with a backflip, and the judges were blown away. Bruno advised Nelly to keep his shoulders loose and Carrie Ann said he needs to open up more emotionally in his next dance.</p>
<p>11) Anne Heche and Keo Motsepe (cha-cha, judge scores: 6, 6, 6 for a total of 18 points. The 51-year-old Emmy-winning actress dated Ellen DeGeneres in the ’90s and appears on NBC dramas “The Brave” and “Chicago P.D.”&nbsp;She boasts she’s “half a century” old. Can she triumph over the younger competitors?</p>
<p>The judges were delighted and seemed surprised. “You made me smile,” Derek said. Bruno thought it was “very, very good” but suggested she needed more hip action. Carrie Ann called Heche the star of the ballroom.</p>
<p>12) AJ McLean and Cheryl Burke (jive, judge scores: 6, 6, 6 for a total of 18 points). McLean, 42, was a member of the Backstreet Boys, one of the most iconic ’90s boy bands.&nbsp;The members of ‘N Sync were the superior dancers in the boy-band wars, according to his partner, Burke.&nbsp; Can he prove he’s a double threat?</p>
<p>The judges were cautiously optimistic, saying they liked his energy but that he needed to focus on his footwork. Carrie Ann added that he can’t be afraid to “go big” with his moves, even if he’s worried about making mistakes. “You feel comfortable out there. This is going to be great,” Derek said.</p>
<p>13) Chrishell Stause and Gleb Savchenko (tango, judge scores: 4, 5, 4 for a total of 13 points). Stause, 39, is the breakout real estate agent star on Netflix’s reality show “Selling Sunset.” She has zero dance experience. Can she overcome that?</p>
<p>Yikes! Bruno said she got the tango into escrow, but they’re far from closing. The real estate metaphor was a kinder way of saying “everything went wrong.” Carrie Ann said Stause has lots of potential, despite the fact that she botched the dance.</p>
<p>14) Charles Oakley and Emma Slater (salsa, judge scores: 4, 4, 4 for a total of 12 points). The&nbsp;56-year-old former NBA&nbsp;star played for the Chicago Bulls and New York Knicks, retiring in 2004. He appeared recently in Michael Jordan’s “The Last Dance” documentary. Oakley&nbsp;knows little about dance but is excited to learn. Will that be enough to keep him around?</p>
<p>The judges enjoyed his enthusiasm, but also tried to nicely say he could do much better. He got ahead of the music and Derek noted he was flat-footed. Bruno encouraged him to turn up the energy.</p>
<p>15) Carole Baskin and Pasha Pashkov (paso doble, judge scores: 4, 4, 3 for a total of 11 points. Baskin,&nbsp;59, is an animal activist and Big Cat Rescue owner who was the villain of “Tiger King” on Netflix.&nbsp;She has no dance experience. Does that even matter?</p>
<p>It was rough. Carrie Ann appreciated that Baskin didn’t hold back, but also found this as surreal as anyone else: “Carole Baskin just danced the paso doble to ‘Eye of the Tiger,’ everyone!” Derek said she “smashed” the dance and Bruno found the performance pretty dull. But he knows how this show works: “I’m sure you’ll be back next week.”</p>
