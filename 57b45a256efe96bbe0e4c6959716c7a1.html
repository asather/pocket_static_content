<h1>Police make arrest in Beltzhoover slaying of heroin dealer</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At first, after hearing a gunshot in Beltzhoover, the witness looked out the window and thought someone had tossed a garbage bag out of the silver car with tinted windows.</p>
<p>But after grabbing a pair of binoculars and looking again, the witness realized it was no garbage bag, but rather a human body.</p>
<p>The car sped off, leaving the city with another homicide victim.</p>
<p>It was just after 11:30 a.m. on Feb. 26. Police identified the man lying in the 200 block of Taft Avenue as Robert Fulton III, a drug dealer who had been fatally shot in the torso. Scattered around him were 13 stamp bags of heroin, a spent shell casing, a fired bullet and an iPhone. Fulton died within the hour at UPMC Mercy.</p>
<p>Using a range of tools — an eyewitness account, cellphone records, surveillance video and search warrants —&nbsp;Pittsburgh police tracked down a suspect. On Friday, they charged Daniel Miles, 31, with the killing and a gun violation.</p>
<p>The one tool that didn’t help them? The city’s usually reliable ShotSpotter gunfire detection system.</p>
<p>In this case, the system — which uses sensors, algorithms and trained people to detect gunfire — appears to have failed, according to the criminal complaint against Miles. The gunshot was mislabeled by ShotSpotter as&nbsp;“other” rather than&nbsp;“single gunshot.” Police were not dispatched until 11:39 a.m. It was not clear from the complaint what time officers actually arrived on scene.</p>
<p>ShotSpotter representatives did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Amie Downs, Allegheny County’s spokeswoman, said Medical Examiner Karl Williams would not speculate on whether quicker medical care would have saved Fulton’s life. A Pittsburgh police spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p>A day after the shooting, detectives reviewed text messages and phone calls on Fulton’s cellphone. They found a rental car agreement from an Avis in Penn Hills for a silver Chevrolet Malibu with Ohio plates.</p>
<p>On Feb. 25, police said, a message was texted from Fulton’s phone to a contact called&nbsp;“D Loc” that said,&nbsp;“You gonna have the rest of that bread for bro tonight or tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The next day — the day of the homicide — a series of text messages and phone calls were exchanged between the two from 6:14 a.m. to 10:48 a.m.</p>
<p>Combing through investigate reports, police eventually learned that D-Loc was a nickname used by Miles.</p>
<p>Having established communication between suspect and victim, police found surveillance video from the area of a silver car with an Ohio license plate. Detectives tracked the car as it went through the Liberty Tunnels outbound around 11:20 a.m., shortly before the shooting a mile away.</p>
<p>Detectives again found the vehicle, this time in Hazelwood, about 20 minutes after the shooting. An alert was put out to police officers in the area, and one spotted the vehicle outside a house in the 100 block of Marsden Street.</p>
<p>Pulling more surveillance video, police saw a man going in and out, wearing a sweatshirt with what detectives called a distinctive logo. He went back and forth between there and a house in the 100 block of Flowers Avenue.</p>
<p>Police got another clue when they learned that the phone recovered from the homicide scene had searched an address in Ohio Township. A Pittsburgh detective contacted the Ohio department and learned that the silver Chevy had come through the township down Interstate 279 about a half hour before the shooting. Video showed a front-seat passenger wearing a sweatshirt with a logo that matched the man in the video from Hazelwood.</p>
<p>Detectives also noted a white cup in the center console. Police would later learn that fingerprints on the cup matched Fulton.</p>
<p>On Feb. 27, police searched the house on Flowers Avenue. They found Miles — who had an active arrest warrant —&nbsp;along with two other adults and four children, heroin, a gun in a cabinet under a bathroom sink, and a a silver Chevy Malibu key fob inside a Victoria’s Secret bag in a closet. Also inside the house: a hooded sweatshirt that police said matched the one seen in the videos.</p>
<p>During the search, the complaint said, Miles told officers that everything in the house was his.</p>
<p>The rest of the case quickly fell into place.</p>
<p>That next day, detectives checked the Malibu and determined that the inside door handles and touch screen display had been wiped down. Inside a garbage bag in the trunk filled with clothing they found heroin stamp bags inside a hat. They were marked&nbsp;“Off White” — the same name as the stamp bags found around Fulton’s body.</p>
<p>Also that day, the county’s crime lab confirmed that the gun found in the Hazelwood house was the one used in the slaying.</p>
