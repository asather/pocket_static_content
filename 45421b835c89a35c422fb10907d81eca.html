<h1>In Washington, COVID-19 leads to canceled tours, shuttered offices and a state of emergency </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The nation’s capital is bracing for the spread of the novel coronavirus, after 10 cases of COVID-19 were reported as of Thursday and fears grew among a globally diverse population in which frequent travel and large-group meetings are the norm.</p>
<p>The tourist-friendly city on Thursday saw the closure of public access to the U.S. Capitol complex and the White House.</p>
<p>“We are taking this temporary action out of concern for the health and safety of congressional employees as well as the public,” House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul D. Irving and Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael C. Stenger said in a joint statement announcing the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center and legislative office buildings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only staff members, the news media and those conducting official business will be able to enter until at least April 1, according to the announcement.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the understanding of those with planned visits interrupted by this necessary, but prudent, decision,” they wrote.</p>
<p>The moves come hours after Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel E. Bowser declared a state of emergency, which allows the city to enforce quarantines and event cancellations. No deaths have been reported from the 10 known coronavirus cases, according to official numbers.</p>
<p>Major organizations and government offices began to cancel public events and allow employees to work from home.</p>

<p>The Washington National Cathedral will close for at least two weeks, joining other churches in the Episcopal Dioceses of Washington and Virginia. The Walter E. Washington Convention Center canceled upcoming events, and concerts at the Anthem, the 9:30 Club, the Lincoln Theater and U Street Music Hall.</p>
<p>Museums run by the Smithsonian Institution will remain open, though the group said it is canceling public events through at least May 3. The Smithsonian’s National Zoo will remain open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After meeting on Thursday, Congress was scheduled to go on a one-week recess — but the coronavirus was creeping into regular business on Capitol Hill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A staffer for Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., tested positive for coronavirus — an announcement that&nbsp;prompted Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, to temporarily close his offices on Thursday. Ms. Cantwell serves on the Senate Finance Committee with Mr. Brown and has an office near Ms. Cantwell in the Hart Senate Office Building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Brown said in a statement said he will “practice social distancing, and will be self-monitoring,” adding that the senator and his staff are experiencing symptoms. Neither Brown nor his staff are experiencing symptoms at this time.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown said his office remains “open to serve Ohioans by phone, and will be in consistent contact with the Senate’s Attending Physician and medical authorities to determine when it is appropriate to reopen the office.”</p>
<p>Other lawmakers joined him, posting notices to their office doors. Visitors going through security placed their personal items into sealed plastic bags before putting them through the scanner.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., will keep his office open and fully staffed, a spokeswoman said, but his staff will conduct all meetings virtually via video and/or phone conference through the end of March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staff for Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., will be work from home beginning Friday, a spokesman said. Mr. Toomey’s seven state offices will remain open but will not accept walk-in visitors or participate in large events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, and Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, both said they would keep their offices open while monitoring any change in official guidance.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee was forced to postpone consideration of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2019/11/06/Trump-district-judge-Ogletree-Pittsburgh-labor-attorney-Scott-Hardy/stories/201911060154?cid=search" target="_blank">William Scott Hardy as a judicial nominee</a> to the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Pennsylvania because too many senators skipped the hearing.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/10/covid-19-coronavirus-landing-page-insert-new-banner" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>The committee chair, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., made no mention of the coronavirus as a cause of the absences — even though one member of the committee, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was in voluntarily self-quarantine after he was potentially exposed to the virus at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several other Judiciary Committee members serve with Ms. Cantwell on the Senate Finance Committee.</p>
<p>“I’m sure people are busy with different things,” Mr. Graham said as he adjourned the meeting. His office did not return a request for comment.</p>
