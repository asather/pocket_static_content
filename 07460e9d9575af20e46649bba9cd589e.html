<h1>North Allegheny Human resources director steps down </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The North Allegheny school board Jan. 22 accepted the resignation of Mary Hawley, director of human resources. Her last day will be May 29.</p>
<p>She joined North Allegheny three years ago.</p>
<p>In other business, the board approved a $58,050 change order for additional rock excavation necessary to install underground utilities at the baseball and softball fields at the senior high school. The project will allow the fields to have restrooms and a concession stand.</p>
<p>Also, the board honored Ingomar Elementary School physical education teacher Dean Boronyak, who was named the State Elementary Health and Physical Education Teacher of the Year in Lancaster last month. Mr. Boronyak has been at North Allegheny since 2008.</p>
<p>“I’m proud to be a part of the North Allegheny School District, where I feel that so many of my colleagues could have received the award, and I would not be the teacher that I am today without the NA team,” he said.</p>
<p>Before joining North Allegheny, he taught kindergarten through sixth grade in the Seneca Valley School District, as well as graduate classes at Gannon University in Erie. He holds a B.A. in health and physical education from Slippery Rock University and a master’s in curriculum and instruction from Gannon University.</p>
<p>Mr. Boronyak helped create and implement the health and physical education curriculum that focuses on fitness, nutrition, social and emotional learning and physical literacy, and has addressed state and national conferences.</p>
<p>“Students always look forward to his class even after they have had him for six years. That in itself speaks volumes for his ability to connect with his students and have them begin building lifelong healthy habits,” said Tracie Michalowski, Ingomar principal.</p>
