<p>Allegheny County will not extend an eviction moratorium for nonpayment of rent, according to an order issued Monday by President Judge Kim Berkeley Clark.&nbsp;However, the order allows for district judges to provide additional time for tenants and landlords to apply for and receive assistance through a statewide aid program.</p>
<p>A statewide eviction moratorium was set to expire Monday, and it was unclear if it might be extended by the Gov. Tom Wolf.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf, a Democrat, last week said he would not extend the moratorium further and asked state legislators to step in. On Monday he <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/08/31/Governor-Wolf-hints-extend-Pennsylvania-eviction-moratorium-pandemic/stories/202008310084" target="_blank">hinted he might take additional action, but later said he could not</a>.</p>
<p>The statewide program to distribute federal funds to renters and landlords <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/08/28/program-aid-renters-Allegheny-County-landlords-applications-funds-Pa-housing/stories/202008280116" target="_blank">has been slow to get money to needy households</a>; as of Friday, it had only paid out 34 of more than 5,000 applications in Allegheny County.</p>
<p>Activists in Pittsburgh on Monday called on the governor, state legislators, and local court officials to take action to extend the moratorium.</p>
<p>“Folks are just in dire straits,”&nbsp;said Celeste Scott, housing justice organizer for Pittsburgh United.</p>
<p>Advocates have argued that with high unemployment and a pandemic still raging, the moratorium is needed to keep people housed.</p>
<p>“Home is the foundation. When you take away someone’s home, you take away everything,” said Ms. Scott.&nbsp;</p>
