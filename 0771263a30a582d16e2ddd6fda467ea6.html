<h1>Florists give flowers to front-line workers </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With the wedding business on temporary hiatus, Karen Toole’s floral studio, <a href="https://www.andflowerspgh.com/" target="_blank">And Flowers</a>, has been dormant for several weeks. But the Highland Park resident is busy coordinating volunteer efforts to bring flowers to front-line workers to brighten their day.</p>
<p>“You’ve got all these talented people in the wedding industry with their events canceled,” Ms. Toole said.&nbsp;“I wanted to create an opportunity to make something beautiful for other people, and we’re very grateful for the team that’s keeping things under control.”</p>
<p>Her <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/flower-bouquets-for-hospitals" target="_blank">GoFundMe</a> fundraiser is nearing its $4,000 goal, which will purchase enough flowers for 400 bouquets as well as wrapping supplies and a delivery van. She credits her friend, Astrid Bitzer, with the idea and helping to run the campaign. Ms. Toole, who teaches couples how to arrange their own wedding floral arrangements, will host a virtual networking party on Wedneday to instruct a group of volunteers in wrapping bouquets.</p>
<p>She’ll bring the flowers to a pair of UPMC hospitals, St. Margaret and Passavant, at the end of each shift during the day.</p>
<p>EngineHouse25 has donated wine for the virtual party and networking event, and EZPZ gatherings is providing a charcuterie board. Eleven business owners ranging from The Sycamore Shop (design and calligraphy) and Olive &amp; Rose Events to Bethel Bakery and Darla Photography have signed up so far, and Ms. Toole says she’s aiming for 20 volunteers.</p>
<p>“I got involved because this is a simple way to do something good,” said Krystle Grandy of <a href="https://www.kgrandymedia.com/" target="_blank">KGrandy Media</a>, which she founded in 2018 to help businesses with social media.&nbsp;“I’m not a nurse, I can’t help on the front line, but this is something we can do.”</p>
<p>Ms. Grandy, 30, met Ms. Toole at an entrepreneurship class at Chatham University.&nbsp;“It’s always good to meet other women in business,” she said.</p>
<p>If the initial flower donation is successful, Ms. Toole intends to repeat the process to donate bouquets to seniors in nursing homes.</p>
