<h1>WPIAL considering two proposals for new football alignment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was almost like a “town hall” meeting for WPIAL football.</p>
<p>School principals, athletic directors and coaches were invited to North Hills Middle School Wednesday night so that the WPIAL could present them with two drastically different conference-alignment proposals that the league is considering for next season. After presenting the proposals on a big screen in the school’s auditorium, the WPIAL asked for comments and questions. There were only a few.</p>
<p>Now, the WPIAL wants all 119 football-playing schools to inform the league by Monday about what proposal they would prefer. The WPIAL will consider the opinions and then make a decision for alignment. The league will release conference alignments Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Although the two proposals are different, one thing is clear: The WPIAL will continue to have six classifications in football and six playoff tournaments. But about the two proposals:</p>
<p>— Proposal one is pretty much status quo from before. The WPIAL conferences would continue to be made up strictly by classifications and geography, when possible. They will schedule nine weeks of games, with teams having the option of playing a Week 0 contest against an opponent of their choice.</p>
<p>What’s different from the past, though, is all non-conference games will be played at the beginning of the season and scheduled by the WPIAL based on geography and competitiveness. In the past, the WPIAL scheduled non-conference opponents randomly and some teams were playing non-conference games in the last or second-to-last week of the regular season.</p>
<p>Also under proposal one, playoff spots would continue to be determined by conference games.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, one conference would have teams in Class 4A, 3A and 2A and would include Aliquippa, Ambridge, Beaver, Blackhawk, Central Valley, Freedom, Hopewell, New Brighton, New Castle and Western Beaver.</p>
<p>Under Proposal 2, playoff teams would be determined by a power ranking system where teams earn more points for victories against teams from a larger classification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judging from a WPIAL survey that schools answered in November — and judging by comments from coaches and WPIAL associate executive director Amy Scheuneman — proposal one is the one likely to be passed.</p>
<p>In the survey, almost 60% of schools said they would prefer a system that keeps the “status quo” with six classifications. Some people, from fans to coaches, had been saying the WPIAL should go back to a four-classification system.</p>
<p>“There’s always the non-vocal majority and the vocal minority,” Scheuneman said. “With hand-selected [non-conference] games, that’s different than before because the biggest complaint we heard before was someone like a Beaver Falls driving far to play a non-conference game.”</p>
<p>When asked if the WPIAL will choose the system based solely on responses from schools, Scheuneman said, “If it’s overwhelming one way, then yes. ... I don’t care either way. We’re still going to get six tournaments. But the first [proposal] addresses the concerns of the group.”</p>
<p>The WPIAL also showed those in attendance Wednesday night schedules for teams. With hand-picked non-conference games in the first proposal, the WPIAL had Pine-Richland, which dropped from Class 6A to 5A this year, still playing 6A powers North Allegheny and Central Catholic in non-conference games. Teams that have struggled to be competitive play a similar team.</p>
<p>“The second proposal with teams from different classes is unique, but I don’t see it being realistic, just from talking to people,” said Penn-Trafford coach John Ruane.</p>
<p>Gateway coach Don Holl, whose team won the WPIAL Class 5A championship this year, complimented the WPIAL for putting the effort in to come up with two vastly different proposals, but sounded like he would prefer the one that is pretty much “status quo.”</p>
<p>“The right teams should be playing each other in non-conference,” Holl said. “If you win a championship, you should have a challenging non-conference schedule. If you’re struggling, you should get to play struggling teams.”</p>
<p>North Hills coach Pat Carey echoed Holl’s sentiments, saying, “It does matter who you’re playing in non-conference games and when you’re playing them.”</p>
<p>The WPIAL football steering committee will meet Jan. 16, consider the opinions that the schools provided and make a decision on one of the proposals. The committee could also tweak the proposal.</p>
<p>The committee will make a recommendation to the WPIAL board of directors for a vote Jan. 20.</p>
