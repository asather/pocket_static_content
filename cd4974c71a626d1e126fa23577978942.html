<h1>GNC moves to furlough 'significant portion' of its staff</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>GNC Holdings said late Friday that it was temporarily furloughing “a significant portion” of its store and corporate associates “across all levels of the organization,” citing the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The announcement did not specify how many GNC employees would be impacted. The company did say that furloughed associates would keep their health benefits in GNC-sponsored plans at least through April, with the company paying the premium.</p>
<p>In addition, the Pittsburgh-based health and wellness retailer has implemented a hiring freeze and eliminated corporate merit increases.</p>
<p>In a March regulatory filing, GNC said the company employed about 12,400 people, including approximately 4,400 full-time and 8,000 part-time workers at the end of 2019.</p>
<p>“These decisions were extremely difficult but necessary as we navigate the challenges ahead of us,” said Ken Martindale, chairman and chief executive officer in a release.&nbsp;“We expect these measures will give us the footing to continue to provide solutions to help others live well.”</p>
<p>While the COVID-19 outbreak has hurt many retailers, GNC was particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>Last month the Downtown company announced that it did not have the cash to pay nearly $700 million in debt that comes due in May. GNC shares, which had already fallen to $1 from a 52-week high of $3.42, immediately lost half their value.</p>
<p>Then last week GNC officials acknowledged that negotiations with an Asia-based lender to refinance the debt had fallen through, putting further pressure on the company.</p>
<p>GNC shares closed Friday at 40 cents, down from 44 cents at Thursday’s close.</p>
