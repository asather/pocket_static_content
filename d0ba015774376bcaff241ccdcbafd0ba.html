<h1>On the medical frontlines in New York City, Shaler native hopes COVID-19 curve is flattening</h1>

<p><em>One in an occasional series.</em></p>
<p>Just off his 14th straight 12-hour shift screening patients for COVID-19 at Metropolitan Hospital in New York City, physician assistant and Shaler native Ross Morgan sounded surprisingly energized late Thursday night.</p>
<p>“I got my second wind,” Mr. Morgan, 30, said from the Park Central Hotel in midtown Manhattan where he and 400 other physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and respiratory therapists are being housed as they temporarily provide additional staffing at city hospitals.</p>
<p>“I’m doing well. I have a good rhythm. Earlier in week I felt the exhaustion.”</p>
<p>His regeneration could be because the number of patients he’s now screening for COVID-19 symptoms has declined by half — to about 20 per shift — from the numbers he was seeing his first week of duty. Fewer people are coming into the East Harlem hospital’s&nbsp;makeshift emergency department annex with symptoms caused by fear of contracting the novel coronavirus, he said.</p>
<p>Or maybe his second wind was psychological because he recently found out that rather than working 21 straight days, he’s going to get a day off Sunday. It would have been his 17th straight day. He plans to do laundry, take coffee to his roommates in their Hell’s Kitchen apartment and “go for a long walk anywhere that’s not near a hospital.”</p>

<p>The Shaler Area High School, University of Pittsburgh and Pace University graduate is among those on the medical front lines of the COVID-19 battle. New York City is the epicenter of the outbreak nationally with 123,146 cases, including at least 8,632 deaths as of Thursday.</p>
<p>Like many of the medical personnel hired by New York City to temporarily expand city hospitals staffing, he was able to take the job because the primary care practice in Manhattan where he worked is closed. The majority of those he’s housed with are from Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Texas and California. They are daily shuttled to and from work.</p>
<p>Local restaurants have been donating meals. On Thursday, dinners came from World Central Kitchen, a not-for-profit organization founded by celebrity chef José Andes to provide meals in the wake of natural disasters.</p>
<p>“Working and living in new environments keeps the fact we’re here to do a job at the forefront of your mind. I don’t stay up late, I keep a good routine. Going through this surrounded by other people also going through it keeps you motivated.”</p>
<p>He plans to sign up for another 21-day stint, but in an effort to reduce burnout, his hours will be reduced to 60 per week.&nbsp;“That’s only five 12-hour shifts and then a day off,” he said excitedly.</p>
<p>While he sees some positive signs that the spread of the virus is slowing, he urged the general public not to get overly excited. He called recent protests against a shutdown of all but essential businesses and self quarantining “very concerning.</p>
<p>“It does seem more and more like this is going to be a marathon. It’s important the general public doesn’t treat it as a sprint. It’s going to take patience. Otherwise, it’s going to spread.”</p>
