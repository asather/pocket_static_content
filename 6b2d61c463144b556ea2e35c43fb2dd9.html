<h1>China reports 63 new cases, but none in newly reopened Wuhan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BEIJING — China’s National Health Commission on Thursday reported 63 new COVID-19 cases, including 61 which it says are imported infections in recent arrivals from abroad and two “native” cases in the southern province of Guangdong.</p>
<p>There were no new cases reported in Hubei, the central province hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak. Two new deaths however were reported, both in Hubei.</p>
<p>The provincial capital of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, ended its 76-day lockdown Wednesday. Long lines formed at the airport and train and bus stations as thousands streamed out of the city to return to their homes and jobs elsewhere.</p>
<p>The National Health Commission also reported 56 new cases of people who tested positive for COVID-19, but did not show any symptoms. In total, 77,370 people in China have recovered from the disease and 3,335 people have died, according to the commission.</p>
<p>As for the Wuhanese, some people couldn’t wait to leave town. Others just wanted to get outside and feel free again. All of them wore face masks against the virus that had forced them to stay in their homes for more than two months.</p>
<p>Many of the thousands who boarded trains, planes and long-distance buses had come to visit relatives during the Lunar New Year holiday in late January and were trapped when the coronavirus lockdown was announced with no advance warning.</p>
<p>A Qinghai province resident who gave her surname as Zhang was with her parents and two children at the airport after being stuck in Wuhan since a vacation that started on Jan. 15. “My husband has been alone at home for almost three months,” she said. “I can’t wait to go back.”</p>
<p>A Shanghai resident who gave his surname as Wang was marking his and his wife’s 80th day in the city by catching the first flight back home. “I’m more than excited to go home,” he said.</p>
<p>When the outbreak started in Wuhan — an industrial city of 11 million people on the Yangtze River — authorities cut off and shut down the&nbsp;original epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in a desperate bid to stop the disease from spreading. It still killed more than 2,500 people in Wuhan, by far the highest death toll in China, and grew into a pandemic.</p>
<p>Once the lockdown was lifted, drivers took to the roads and people went to parks and public plazas. Residents who wanted to enter a building or board a train were still checked to see if they were running a fever, though. The fear has subsided but not gone away.</p>
<p>Indeed,&nbsp;the city that has reopened after more than 10 weeks is a profoundly damaged one, a place whose recovery will be watched worldwide for lessons on how populations move past pain and calamity of such staggering magnitude.</p>
<p>In Wuhan, sickness and death have touched hundreds of thousands of lives, imprinting them with trauma that could linger for decades. Businesses, even those that have reopened, face a wrenching road ahead, with sluggishness likely to persist. Neighborhood authorities continue to regulate people’s comings and goings, with no return to normalcy in sight.</p>
<p>Amid streets newly bustling with cars and pedestrians, Wang Chun celebrated the lifting of a virus lockdown on her hometown of Wuhan on Wednesday with a dance outdoors after 2 1/2 months largely cooped up at home.</p>
<p>“I’m so happy Wuhan has defeated the virus,” Wang said after recording a K-Pop-inspired duet with a male partner for posting on the internet. Neither of them wore face masks, at least for a brief few minutes.</p>
<p>After she put on the mask again, Wang confronted the question many of the city’s 11 million residents are asking themselves: When will they be going back to work?</p>
<p>“That’s a very good question,” Wang responded with a giggle.</p>
