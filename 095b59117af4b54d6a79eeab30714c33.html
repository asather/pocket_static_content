<h1>A West End thrift shop with charm and love for animals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Animal Advocates Thrift Shop reopened on June 1, and it’s newly stocked with one-of-a-kind collectibles, unique pieces of clothing, jewelry, housewares and pet products.</p>
<p>The West End shop is a major fundraiser for homeless cats and dogs, and animal lovers can help in two ways. They can shop in the store, and people who have been decluttering their homes during coronavirus quarantines can now take their castoffs to the shop at 35 Wabash St., Pittsburgh 15220.</p>
<p>One of the charms of the shop is the shop cat. A friendly and social feline always lives there until someone adopts it. The current shop cat is the all-white fluffy Sam, who is 16 years old, and that makes him special.</p>
<p>Sam, who is sweet and loves to cuddle, is part of the Senior to Senior long-term foster program. If a senior citizen takes Sam into his or her home, Animal Advocates will pay his veterinary bills for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>People interested in Sam can meet him at the shop or send email to animaladvocatespgh@live.com or call 412-928-9777.</p>
<p>Although the shop was closed because of the pandemic, 42 dogs and cats were adopted in March, April and May, said Patricia Murphy, a board member and longtime volunteer at Animal Advocates. All animals are kept in foster homes, and more people volunteered to foster animals during the quarantine, she said.</p>
<p>Don’t just show up, unannounced, with donations. Call 412-928-9777 or email animaladvocatespgh@live.com to let them know you are coming. Donated items especially appreciated are women’s summer clothes, jewelry, knickknacks, kitchen items and small kitchen appliances.</p>
<p>The shop has already been deep cleaned multiple times and will follow safety precautions.</p>
<p>Shoppers should ring the doorbell to gain admittance. Only two shoppers at a time will be allowed in the store. Everyone must wear face masks and stay 6 feet apart. At this time, shoppers cannot try on clothes or use the restrooms.</p>
<p>Regular shop hours are in effect: 11 a.m.-2 p.m. Monday; noon-3 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday; 10:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Thursday; noon-3 p.m. Friday; and 11 a.m.- 3 p.m. Saturday.</p>
<p>The shop will also have a sidewalk sale from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. June 20.</p>

<p><strong>Rabies vaccinations</strong></p>
<p>As shops and services open up more, in the wake of coronavirus shutdowns, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture and the Pennsylvania Veterinary Medical Association remind pet owners to make sure rabies vaccinations are brought up to date. By law all cats and dogs older than 3 months must be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Check the website of a shelter near you for low-cost vaccination clinics, including those at the Beaver County Humane Society in Center. Clinics are scheduled on June 12, 16, 19, 24 and 26.</p>
<p>Appointments must be made in advance. Call 724-775-5801, ext. 192, or schedule on the Beaver County Humane Society Facebook page.</p>
<p>Before your appointment time, fax your animal’s prior vaccine history to BCHS at 724-709-8357. A signed rabies certificate is the only acceptable form of proof for prior rabies vaccines.</p>
