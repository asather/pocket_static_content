<h1>Police release new details in officer-involved shooting on North Side</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A 25-year-old Mount Oliver man was shot and killed by police and an officer wounded Thursday night in a traffic stop on the North Side, Allegheny County police said in a press conference Friday.</p>
<p>Elijah Brewer, a passenger riding in a 2002 Lexus, was identified by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office early Friday as the person killed during the traffic stop. An unidentified city detective was shot in the leg, police said. The officer remains in stable condition at a hospital, police said.</p>
<p>The incident began just before 7 p.m. Thursday night when police in an unmarked GMC Yukon pulled over a Lexus containing a driver and Mr. Brewer in the 200 block of East Ohio Street, for unclear reasons. Police said upon stopping the car, they smelled "burnt marijuana" inside and asked the driver to exit.</p>
<p>That's when Mr. Brewer got out and fired "at least two rounds" at detectives, police said. Four detectives fired shots back in an exchange, resulting in the wounding of one officer and the death of Mr. Brewer, police said.</p>
<p>Police said they recovered a 9mm handgun from Mr. Brewer.</p>
<p>He was taken to Allegheny General Hospital where he was pronounced dead 41 minutes after the traffic stop, according to the county examiner's office. The number of times police shot Mr. Brewer is pending county medical examiner reports, police said.</p>
<p>Detectives were not wearing body-worn cameras during the event, police said. The driver of the vehicle, who fled the stop during the exchange of gunfire, was later captured and detained.</p>
<p>Mr. Brewer was on state parole from a 2014 guilty pleas to aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and firearms violations.</p>
