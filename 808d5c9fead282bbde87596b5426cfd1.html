<h1> Obituary: Gerald D. Hines | Real estate developer and patron of architects </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gerald D. Hines, a Houston-based real estate developer who became a preeminent patron of major architects, hiring such renowned designers as I.M. Pei, Frank Gehry, Philip Johnson and Cesar Pelli to build office towers, shopping centers and concert halls around the world, died Aug. 23 at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 95.</p>
<p>His real estate firm announced the death. He reportedly had cancer.</p>
<p>Mr. Hines was an engineer who was drawn to Houston from his native Indiana because its hot, muggy climate was a natural place to install air-conditioning systems. He soon became interested in real estate and in 1957 established the company that would become one of the world’s largest developers.</p>
<p>At first, his firm — originally Gerald D. Hines Interests, now simply Hines — was a one-man operation: The first buildings Hines put up were warehouses. He began to make a mark on Houston’s landscape in 1970, when the first phase of the Galleria shopping mall was completed on what had been prairie land.</p>
<p>Designed by Gyo Obata of Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum, the mall was based on the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milan. Mr. Hines insisted on installing an ice-skating rink, which was considered an extravagance at first, but soon became a major attraction.</p>
<p>“Many developers just want to tell the architect what they want,” Mr. Obata told the Houston Chronicle in 2007. “I think he’s one of the few developers that really listens to the architect.”</p>
<p>Within the next few years, Mr. Hines developed several buildings that would transform Houston’s skyline, first with One Shell Plaza, a 50-story skyscraper designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill that opened in 1971.</p>
<p>Four years later, two other buildings, both designed by Mr. Johnson and John Burgee, had an even more striking impact: One Post Oak Central, near the Galleria mall, was a curvilinear skyscraper reminiscent of New York’s Flatiron Building; and Pennzoil Place, which consisted of two adjacent trapezoidal towers on the same city block, shooting up from the ground like dark glass stalagmites.</p>
<p>“Gerry Hines has changed the whole development outlook with his approach to quality architecture,” Mr. Burgee told the Chronicle in 1990. “He is the first one to do it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hines often contacted architects on his own, asking if they’d be interested in working on projects with his company. He had the architects trim budgets by eliminating frills and usually hired them only for the initial design.</p>
<p>“Excellence in architecture does not mean that you throw away the budget,” Mr. Hines said in 2002, when he received the J.C. Nichols Prize for Visionary Urban Development from the Urban Land Institute. “It means that you design the best quality within that budget. ... Not all our buildings will win an award, but they will all be very good citizens in their community.”</p>
<p>Gerald Douglas Hines was born Aug. 15, 1925, in Gary, Ind. His father was an electrician at a steel mill, his mother a homemaker and teacher.</p>
<p>Mr. Hines served in the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II, then received a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering in 1948 from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. He worked for a manufacturer of air-conditioning systems and accepted a transfer to a job in Houston.</p>
<p>After buying a building and doubling his money within a few years, he went into real estate development in 1957.</p>
<p>His first marriage, to Dorothy Schwarz, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife since 1981, artist Barbara Fritzsche; two children from his first marriage, Jeffrey Hines and Jennifer Hines Robertson, both of Houston; two children from his second marriage, Serena Hines of New York City and Trevor Hines of Los Angeles; 15 grandchildren; and one great-grandson.</p>
