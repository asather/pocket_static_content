<h1>Keeping markets open: Farmers markets will return, but with changes </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>We’re a little more than a month into stay-at-home orders, social distancing, crowd limitations and the cancellation of sporting and cultural events because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s understandable that many people are desperately longing for some sign of a return to normalcy.</p>
<p>Organizers of the many farmers markets in the area — spring and summer mainstays in numerous communities — are making plans to continue bringing fresh produce from local farms to urban customers, even if it requires some major changes in procedures. But for continuing that small slice of a warm-weather tradition, we can be thankful.</p>
<p>Emily Bourne, program manager in Pittsburgh’s Office of Special Events, which coordinates five farmers markets in the city, informed vendors that the markets will open sometime in June, about a month later than the usual mid-May launch.</p>
<p>And yes, there will be changes to minimize the risk of spreading the coronavirus. The most obvious will be that customers cannot browse and sample the produce. Instead, they will have to shop, order and pay vendors online and go to the markets to pick up their orders. In addition, there will be no food prepared on site.</p>
<p>Vendors will be spaced out to observe social distancing, and customers will have to likewise spread out and make their visit as short as possible.</p>
<p>There will be hand-sanitizing stations and, unfortunately for pet lovers, no pets will be permitted in the markets this season.</p>
<p>Other farmers markets in the city and surrounding counties are also hoping to be open this season with similar changes and restrictions to keep patrons safe.</p>
<p>It’s a huge difference for what has become for many a weekly tradition of shopping the many vendor offerings of fruits, vegetables and other food items. Longtime customers have come to know the vendors and looked forward to the weekly visits and conversations. They are quintessential community gatherings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things will be very different this year, but organizers are hopeful it’s a temporary disruption that regular customers will understand and accept as a way to keep the markets open — and look forward to better days ahead.</p>
