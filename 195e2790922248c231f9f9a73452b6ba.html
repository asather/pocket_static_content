<h1>Buying Here: Spectacular views from the edge of Mount Washington priced at $575,000</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At first glance, the house at <strong>320 William St.</strong>&nbsp;on Mount Washington looks like it’s waiting for climate change to raise the Monongahela River. But it’s not really a house on stilts. The building is&nbsp;securely&nbsp;embedded in the hillside.</p>
<p>“That’s just [to support] the decking that we added,” explained owner and listing agent Reed Pirain of the Reed Pirain Group / NextHome PPM Realty.</p>
<p>The three-bedroom, three-bath house (MLS No. 1451985) is listed for $575,000 (<a href="http://thereedpiraingroup.com/listings/0,163798/320-William-St-Carson-PA-15203/" target="_blank">thereedpiraingroup.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;412-812-6117).&nbsp;It is currently under contract.</p>
<p>Mr. Pirain recognized the potential of this hillside abode as soon as he saw it.</p>
<p>“Having sold homes in the area, we knew the views were something special,” he said.</p>
<p>The views of Downtown are spectacular from the wraparound deck off the main living level, an upper balcony and a rooftop deck. There’s also something to be seen from every room in the 1,512-square-foot house, thanks to its new open floor plan.</p>
<p>Mr. Pirain first visited the house, which is on Mount Washington’s border with Allentown, as a potential listing.</p>
<p>“The house had been on the market with another agent for quite some time,” he said. “After meeting with the seller, we realized the best-case scenario for her was an easy transaction that would help her move and not have to worry about potential repairs and unexpected costs that may come with a traditional sale.”</p>
<p>Mr. Pirain bought the property for $140,00 in April 2019 and spent seven months gutting and&nbsp;renovating&nbsp;the four-story space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We were able to maximize the amazing views and city skyline from almost every level of the home as well as bringing in today’s modern amenities,” he said.</p>
<p>New flooring, a new kitchen and new bathrooms make this a rare “new” single home on the coveted slopes of Mount Washington. Mr. Pirain said it was a big job but&nbsp;well worth the expense and effort.</p>
<p>“I&nbsp;used to live on Bailey Avenue just a street away and most of my family has lived in Mount Washington at some point in their life,” he said. “Our family-owned real estate company started in Mount Washington 30-plus years ago with our first apartment building purchase and we have been representing buyers and sellers in the area ever since.”</p>
<p>The property’s assessment is $147,100. It is one of a handful of houses on this side of William Street, which is the border between Mount Washington and Allentown. Over the last seven years, only two houses have sold, both on the Allentown side of William Street, for $82,000 in November 2015 and $452,000 in May 2013 (<a href="http://www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/GeneralInfo.aspx" target="_blank">http://www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/GeneralInfo.aspx?</a>).</p>
<p>Once the home was ready for market, Mr. Pirain invited the former owner back to see the transformation.</p>
<p>“When she walked in after seeing it completed, she started to cry,” he said. “She was just so happy to see that another family will soon start their own memories there.”</p>
