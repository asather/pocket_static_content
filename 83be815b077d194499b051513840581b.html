<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 04.09.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Zeise</strong>: Let’s get it rolling</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Hi Paul, did you watch 'The Scheme' on HBO? If this stuff goes on, everyone knows it, and it basically goes unpunished, can Pitt basketball ever compete at the highest level trying to do things 'the right way'? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: This is a great question but I would answer it this way. From about 2002 until about 2012 Pitt competed at the highest level and was a couple of bounces of the ball from getting into the Final Four. Pitt won the Big East Tournament a couple of times even though dirty programs like Syracuse and Louisville were clearly making their own rules. Pitt was a No. 1 seed at least once (maybe twice actually). Pitt has proven it can compete at a high level and do it without getting involved in these kinds of things.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Do you think Fillipponi really believes that Jameis to the Steelers is a good thing, or a possibility, or is he just doing it for the Twitter action and to get people worked up? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: He is a talk show host and one of the most naturally talented talk show hosts I’ve worked with. He does believe Jameis Winston would be a good fit for the Steelers. But clearly now he has turned it into almost a parody and is getting the reaction he has wanted. It is fun and it is what makes him good at his job.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Do you think the Rooneys called in a favor to avoid having to do 'Hard Knocks'? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t know, I am not big into sports conspiracies. However, it wouldn’t shock me ha ha The two sports conspiracies I do subscribe to are The lottery being fixed for the Knicks to get Patrick Ewing and the lottery being fixed for the Penguins to get Sidney Crosby. Ewing to the Knicks was great for the league and Crosby to Pittsburgh might have saved hockey in one of the NHL’s most important markets. Of course I have no proof of either but these are the only two conspiracies that I think might hold some water</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Paul: Since we may be eschewing handshakes for good, should hockey teams now end their playoff series with elbowing each other to the head, high sticking or cross checking? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Just keep their gloves on and fist bump each other as they go through the line</p>
<p><strong>BB Fan</strong>: Schools are done for the year. I hate to be political but, we need to do more testing to get back to sports and somewhat regular activities. What do you think? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Absolutely. And that is what will happen. They aren’t going back to sports unless there is testing available readily.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: This is purely a compliment. My wife hates your voice. She makes me turn it down in the car. She also hated Myron Cope's voice. And you two newspaper background guys have that in common....and you're very good. So how would you rate your voice? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Your wife obviously has terrible taste in men’s voices....... I have no idea where my voice rates, I just talk on the radio and hope people are entertained</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: You mentioned on the air you like golf. If things happen as plans, how are the networks going to deal with golf's majors all in the middle of football season? Me, I'll go nuts. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It will be incredible. And believe me - the networks will love having too many sports to try and squeeze in. They have lost a lot of revenue and will happily try and make it back. I close my eyes an envision a Sunday when I watch the Masters all day, the Steelers at 4:15 and a playoff baseball game at 8</p>
<p><strong>FatBuddy</strong>: Paul, do you think we address our needs for back up lbs in this draft? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes. I actually do. And it won’t shock me if it is with that early (No. 49) pick</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Paul, the Winston-to-Pittsburgh talk will probably prove fruitless, but what if the Steelers approached it like this: Bring him in (if somehow, they can afford it) and get him up to speed on the offense in case Ben has a relapse. If Ben is fine, then at some point during the season, when some team is looking to replace an injured QB, the Steelers can flip him for a draft pick. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: That would be bad business. I would only want him on like a 5-year deal so Ben’s successor is in house and the transition would be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: As a long time Pitt football season ticket holder, I can assure you we have been practicing social distancing at games for many years. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: This has been the running joke since Heather Lyke said she can’t imagine football without fans.....</p>
<p><strong>Randall</strong>: 1) What is your son Elijah doing as far as football. 2) Do you think Ben R. really influences Steeler backup QB or drafting QB situation. He has never endured a QB controversy where fans chant for backup after an interception. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Elijah is done. He took his one shot at the NFL and played in four preseason games. He got cut and came home and said “I’m good, time to move on from football, I have no regrets now” and he used his dual accounting/finance degree to get a job working for a financial firm here in Pittsburgh. I couldn’t be prouder of him. And I would say Ben’s reaction to the drafting of Mason Rudolph - it was very negative - suggests he has no power to control what the Steelers do in terms of signing and drafting a backup QB</p>
<p><strong>DavieJ in WI</strong>: I know it’s early but Steelers D...top 3 in the nfl? Yay or nay? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think so provided they stay healthy. They really don’t have a ton of depth. They need Bud Dupree, TJ Watt, Minkah Fitzpatrick, Cam Heyward and both corners to stay healthy. But yes I think they can be that high of a level of a defense</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Kudos to you Paul for your recent radio show soliloquy on mental health and depression during this time of social distancing and self quarantine. I have no doubt that your words and advice will benefit a number of people now and in the future. THANK YOU PAUL! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Thanks - if people can get to the point where they view and treat their mental health the same way they view and treat their physical health we will be in a much better place.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Please provide some tips for those out there having a hard time dealing with the isolation, lack of sports, and social contact. Those who might be prone to depression. Thank you. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Sure. Again depression is real. I’ve lived with it, fought with it and battled it my entire life. I’ve been hospitalized for it multiple times. And times like this are very tough on people who suffer from depression and this is a critical time to take care of yourself. So here are some things that have helped: Get enough, consistent sleep. I try and get in bed at the same time and get out of bed at the same time every day. Notice I didn’t say wake up I said get out of bed. You need to get up and move. You need to eat good, but don’t over eat (when we are bored it is easy to sit around and snack all day). You need to be informed but don’t overdo it with watching the cable news and whatnot - it can become overwhelming and doom and gloom is not good for your mind. So you need to get away from the TV. Take a few walks a day. Yesterday I rode a bike for almost 10 miles. Just the fresh air and change of scenery helps. Also make sure you take your medication <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Those things all help me cope with what is going on.</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Hi Paul, hope you and your family are doing well. The loss of college spring football practice gives a big advantage to the junior- or senior-dominated teams next season, provided that the games are played in the fall, doesn't it? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t know. Spring football is very overrated to me.I would say this - a new coaching staff or a staff with a new coordinator who is gonna change the scheme is at a disadvantage. Those spring practices are important for that kind of installation</p>
<p><strong>DavieJ in WI</strong>: Hola PZ! ANY reason why the Steelers CANT win their division this year (barring injuries)???? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The Baltimore Ravens? Ha ha. I think the Steelers can win the division but I don’t know that they will. I think the Ravens are better and the Browns will be better than they were. It will be a tough ride</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong>: Paul, is the NBA or MLB paying their players? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes both have some sort of fund and pay scale for their players during this. I read about it a few weeks ago. Veterans get one amount, middle aged type players get a little lower amount and the least experienced players get a lower amount</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hi Paul, hope you and your family are staying safe. I know the Steelers are looking for playmakers on Offense and I totally agree that we need someone who can get the ball in the end zone, but from looking at the depth behind Bush, Williams, Watt, and Bud, I have to say its would be scary if say Watt and/or Bush got hurt for an extended period of time. Do you think they look to the Draft for depth or do you think they could bring a guy like Clay Matthews in being that he played both Inside and Outside LB for GB? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t know what Matthews would cost but there is no doubt they will, either by draft or signing, address the lack of depth at linebacker. They need to and they know they need to. Matthews might be out of their reach but they will have to get someone.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: I’ve been a Pitt fan since 1963, so I have witnessed it but still defies belief to me an historical football program like this can be mediocre, not better, not worse, for nearly the last 40 years. What holds them back Paul? Is the only way out of this is to catch lightning in a bottle with a coach who turns out to be a dynamic recruiter? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I actually think the opposite - they need to stop changing coaches all the time and build a program. They seem to be on the right track with Pat Narduzzi and just need to let him keep doing his thing. There are various reasons why it hasn’t worked out for 40 years but if you count interim coaches there has been about 16 different Pitt coaches since 1975. That’s not ideal</p>
<p><strong>Cherry Picar</strong>: All time with Pens Best 2 centers are Lemiux and Crosby. Who would number 3 be? Francis or Apps? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: i would say Evgeni Malkin</p>
<p><strong>Steve in Ohio</strong>: Hi Paul, <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Hello</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Paul, I watched the 1979 World Series Game 5 replay on Major League Network Monday. Great seeing those old Pirates greats. I think the key that season was when the Pirates traded to get Bill Madlock, a great-hitting third-baseman, from the Cubs. Do you think we will ever again see the Pirates make a smart trade like this and become a pennant contender? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They have made some smart trades the last few years. They have also made some bad trades. But the A.J. Burnett trade was one that I’d say sprung the Pirates into contention.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>: Paul -- it seems that the Steelers are plugging offensive holes with adequate replacements -- Ebron, WIsnewski, etc. Is adequate good enough or is Ben the difference. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think both players have a chance to be more than adequate. They are both players who can help the Steelers win. I think both are upgrades over the players they will replace</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: I am concerned Rudolph may suffer from shell shock. His first year as a starter he was knocked unconscious, hit over the head with his own helmet, accused of using racial slurs, and suffered a serious, painful injury that ended his season. That is a lot to endure in one season for a young guy. Does his makeup indicate he can bounce back with no residual effects. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I thought he was shell shocked the next week after he got hurt. But then he got benched for a few weeks and he was able to recover and I thought he played well when he returned for that one game. He will be fine</p>
<p><strong>Amanda</strong>: I haven't forgotten Paul you and Walls making fun of me on the air. Promoting drinking is a sin and not morally right on a sports show. I wish I could tell you that in person so maybe you'd get it. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I’m gonna take you by surprise, and make you realize, Amanda! I’m gonna tell you right away, I can’t wait another day, Amanda! I’m gonna say it like a man and help you understand, Amanda, I love you......</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: I'll get skewered for suggesting this but if his neck is healthy and he'd be willing to be the back up at a reasonable cost, I'd prefer Joe Flacco over Rudolph or Hodges. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes you will get skewered and should because he is done. As in done done. As in CNP, which stands for can not play......</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: I just saw the clip of Dave Parker throwing out Brian Downing in 1979 All Star game. The man deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I agree it is nonsense that he isn’t. Baseball is the one two-way sport that really truly values defense when it comes to things like all star and hall of fame voting</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Heard Coach Dambrot in your show. Did he really say allplayers will be able to transfer without sitting out a year in the future? That sounds like the end of mid majors? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes and he is right. They are changing the rules. It will hurt mid-majors at first but I think mid-majors will benefit from it in the long run. They will have plenty of players transferring from bigger programs to them in order to get more playing time. It will work both ways</p>
<p><strong>Jason Thompson</strong>: I haven't played baseball for the Pirates in decades. What am I up to these days? How come the Pirates never invite me to come see them play? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: While Jason Thompson, they could have used you the last few years!</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Paul every year you keep making excuses for Narduzzi. This guy might be a solid coordinator but he is definitely not an above average head coach. His gameday decisions stink, he doesn't recruit well and Pitt will never go to the next level with him. Yet you keep defending him. It's a joke. I bet if Pitt wins 7 games this season you'll defend him again. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: How am I defending him by saying Pitt should give him more time. Do you like the revolving door of coaches? Was 2009-2015 fun for you? He has built the program and it should be a breakthrough year for them. If he only wins 7 games this year it would be a very bad step for the program. I’m confident they will win more than that</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Hi Paul...if the Steelers draft an edge defender at #49, is that possibly a signal that they don’t think Dupree will sign a long term deal? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t think they can sign Dupree and they know it. And I think they will draft a linebacker early because they need depth there and also a long-term solution</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: NCAA charges officials to officiate their baseball games. With the canceled schedule for 2020, the ncaa has decided to keep 75% of the fees they charged for 2019. Isn't this group outdated and ridiculous? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Unfortunately I have no idea what you are talking about. It sounds wrong but I don’t know the details so I can’t give you an opinion</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: Madlock came from the Giants <br> <strong>Scott Stout</strong>: Hey Amanda, do you know what the difference is between intelligence and your stupidity? Intelligence has limits. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Fight nice now children!</p>
<p><strong>RebelLaw</strong>: with the changes with the CBA, why not take a flyer on bringing Martavious back? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: How about, no. That would be a disaster. They finally have rid themselves of all their pain in the ass players</p>
<p><strong>Church lady</strong>: Who is this Amanda bozo? <br> <strong>jake</strong>: Amanda is an idot <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Amanda seems to be struggling to win friends and influence people......</p>
<p><strong>Rich from Indio</strong>: I can't underatand why the Steelers would draft a WR. They have 3 quality WR's now plus 2 TE's. A 2nd round pick doesn't get on the field much in 2020. A RB is more reasonable but the OL and ILB need help/depth. Do you think they go WR or RB in 2nd round. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t. I think they will go linebacker, Oline or tight end</p>
<p><strong>Bizzee Bee</strong>: How is it possible that the NFL players that Marty Blazier ripped off did not kick his a_s? It is even crazier that he is not in jail. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: That’s the American way - make a deal, tell on some others, stay out of jail.</p>
<p><strong>Damien</strong>: Thoughts on what it would take to acquire someone like Philip Lindsay? Obviously very doubtful something like that would ever happen, but the writing on the wall in Denver seems like he may be on his way out. Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Is he even available? I think he is under the contract. And I don’t think they would trade much for a reserve running back</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Paul will you please explain to all of us what Amanda is talking about? I am very curious. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I have no idea, it is some kind of clown show</p>
<p><strong>Suds</strong>: What is going with Heywards contract ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Nothing yet. He is in his last year. I would assuke <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: assume they would want to resign it.</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: I see that Augusta has an annual Ladies amateur golf tournament there. Has there been any talk of having a LPGA tournament there also? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think this Is something that has been discussed in recent years. It needs to happen soon, though having multiple events means having to close the club for multiple weeks and members may not go for that <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well this has been fun but I got to go!! Have a great day and let’s do it again</p>
