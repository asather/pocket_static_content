<p>Ryan Shazier is moving out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/Steelers-Linebacker-Ryan-Shazier-Selling-15295979.php" target="_blank">Realtor.com’s Randy White</a> reported Tuesday that the Steelers linebacker is putting his Fox Chapel home up for sale with a hefty $2.95 million asking price.</p>
<p>He purchased the property for $2.6 million in 2017, soon after the spinal injury that has put his football career on pause. Now it appears he’s looking to unload the spacious 9,000 square foot home -- which features seven bedrooms and 7.5 bathrooms -- for a tidy profit.</p>
<p>Shazier and wife Michelle welcomed a son, Lyon, to their growing family in January of 2019.</p>
<p>He has not played with the team since his 2017 injury, but he remains an official member of the roster. The Steelers placed him on the reserve/retired list.</p>
