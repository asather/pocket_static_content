<h1>Positivity pays off for Gregory Polanco, Pirates offense</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gregory Polanco’s struggles have been impossible to ignore. Entering Saturday’s game, the Pirates outfielder was hitting just .085 with 24 strikeouts in 47 at-bats, an absurdly high rate.</p>
<p>While teammates have insisted that Polanco has been putting in the work and his smile has remained, the results have been non-existent.</p>
<p>It’s actually been similar to the Pirates offense on the whole.</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton has talked in recent days about maintaining a positive approach, believing the results — specifically the runs and wins — will come. The Pirates simply need to keep chipping away.</p>
<p>Facing the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday at PNC Park, Polanco, Shelton and a few other Pirates hitters made those predictions look like more than smoke with an offensive onslaught that led to a 12-5 rout.</p>
<p>In winning consecutive games — and a series — for the first time this season, the Pirates got eight extra-base hits, including three home runs. Over their past two games, they’ve now totaled 28 hits and 19 runs.</p>
<p>“A win is always fun,” Polanco said. “You know, you get two wins in a row, that’s a good sign. We’re going to keep working. We’re gonna stay hungry. That’s our mentality right now. We’re going to stay hungry , and we’re going to fight through the season no matter what.”</p>
<p>Strong offensive performances came from several different places Saturday, as the Pirates improved to 6-17. Adam Frazier, batting in the No. 2 spot, had a home run, three hits and three RBIs. Colin Moran smacked three doubles. Bryan Reynolds, Polanco and Jacob Stallings had two hits apiece, the catcher belting his first home run of the season.</p>
<p>As encouraging as all of that was, it’s hard to look at Saturday’s game and not focus on Polanco, who’s become a polarizing figure in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>After Wednesday’s loss to the Indians, many fans wanted Polanco cut, traded, designated for assignment or forced to live in Cleveland. He had one hit in his previous 20 at-bats and struck out in 10 of those.</p>
<p>It looked like Polanco needed a break, a miracle or maybe both.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shelton continued to back Polanco both publicly and privately. The conversations, Shelton explained, are ongoing with several players, but there was seemingly an added weight to those that occurred with Polanco.</p>
<p>In the cages, Polanco said he appreciated the pats on the back he received from hitting coach Rick Eckstein, who also continued to preach positivity.</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to stay positive,” Polanco said. “Every day I go to the cage, and Rick helps me a lot. Like, ‘Hey, think like an MVP. Think like a winner. Think like you’re the best.’ That’s how you get out of a slump, you know?”</p>
<p>Apparently.</p>
<p>In addition to his home run, Polanco also doubled, the two balls exceeding 105 mph in exit velocity. For his home run, Polanco crushed a hanging curveball from Brewers starter Josh Lindblom, the 434-foot, two-run shot giving the Pirates a 3-1 lead.</p>
<p>“He’s been working real hard the past few days,” Frazier said. “It showed up in the game [Saturday]. I know he’s happy about it. We’re happy about it. Happy for him. Hopefully we can start feeding off of each other and keep the ball rolling.”</p>
<p>The funny thing about the Pirates offense, specifically Polanco, is that its struggles have morphed from physical to mental.</p>
<p>Nobody has discovered some sort of mechanical flaw in their swing. Players are simply underperforming and reminding themselves of that on a daily basis. The abysmal record also hasn’t helped.</p>
<p>But the past few games seem to indicate the Pirates are getting close to breaking out.</p>
<p>Moran had three doubles, including two off lefties. After bouncing between third, first and eighth, it’ll be interesting to see if Shelton decides to keep Frazier in the No. 2 spot and bat Kevin Newman leadoff when he returns to the lineup on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Pirates also strung together a few more big innings, which they have had a tough time doing. Polanco’s homer made it a 3-1 game in the fourth. Then Reynolds — who homered, tripled and had four RBIs Friday — crushed a ball to the North Side Notch after Frazier’s homer.</p>
<p>Stallings’ two-run shot in the sixth capped another strong game for him. The Pirates catcher has started six of the last seven behind the plate and has gone 8-for-17 (.471) during that time.</p>
<p>And when Dovydas Neverauskas let the Brewers creep to within three by giving up a three-run homer in the seventh, the Pirates actually responded in a positive way, getting a bases-loaded walk from Stallings, a two-run single from Erik Gonzalez and a two-run double from Frazier.</p>
<p>The game ended with Polanco flashing an ear-to-ear smile and the Pirates finally getting to enjoy the end of a baseball game for a second straight day. But their hope is that there’s momentum starting to build here, the belief that this offense might not actually be as bad as it once appeared.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of positives that these guys can take away from the past two games to use for the next game," said Derek Holland, who earned his first win as a Pirate with five innings of one-run ball. "Just continue to have that momentum, that positive mindset.</p>
<p>"We've put the work in. I'm not worried about the past, how many games it's been or anything like that. We just have to keep plugging away because we know things are going to happen for us."</p>
