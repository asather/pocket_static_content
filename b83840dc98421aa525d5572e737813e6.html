<h1>Judge: Groups suing Gov. Wolf over COVID-19 restrictions must respond by Monday to motion to stay</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The group of plaintiffs who sued Gov. Wolf over his COVID restrictions and won a ruling from U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV this week have until Monday to respond to the Wolf administration's motion to stay the order.</p>
<p>Judge Stickman on Thursday set a deadline for a response for Monday at noon.&nbsp;The plaintiffs are the counties of Washington, Butler, Greene and Fayette, along with U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of Butler County and state Reps. Marci Mustello of Butler County, Daryl Metcalfe of Cranberry and Tim Bonner of Grove City.</p>
<p>The Wolf administration late Wednesday asked the judge to stay his order striking down several of the main restrictions imposed by Gov. Wolf and his secretary of health, Rachel Levine.</p>
<p>The judge's ruling means that gatherings of more than 250 people outside and 25 inside, not including bars and restaurants for routine business purposes, are now permitted despite the fact that the state continues to urge citizens to avoid big gatherings.</p>
<p>Attorney General Josh Shapiro's office asked for the stay pending an appeal to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and to "maintain the status quo with respect to the stay-at-home, business closure, and congregate limit orders."</p>
<p>In the motion to stay, state lawyers said that lifting the restrictions now will endanger the lives of Pennsylvanians.</p>
<p>"The virus still exists and continues to infect hundreds of Pennsylvanians each day," they said.</p>
<p>In just the two months since the state filed its response to the complaint, they said, nearly 55,000 new cases have been diagnosed.</p>
<p>"Suddenly abandoning the current mitigation efforts will open the floodgates and allow the virus to freely spread throughout the Commonwealth," the motion says. "And all of the progress Pennsylvania has made over the last six months will be for naught."</p>
