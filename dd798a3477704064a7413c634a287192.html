<h1>World briefs:  Cartel head’s son to face U.S. charges </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s top security official said Friday that authorities are prepared for possible retaliation from crime syndicate figures following the extradition to the United States of the son of a major drug cartel leader.</p>
<p>Mexico did not issue a special alert about potential danger, but authorities were monitoring for criminal activity that might result from the extradition, Alfonso Durazo, Mexico’s federal secretary of public security, told reporters.</p>
<p>His comments came a day after Mexico extradited Ruben Oseguera Gonzalez to the United States to face federal drug charges.</p>
<p>Mr. Oseguera, 30, is known as “Menchito,” after his father, Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes, 53, the fugitive leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, considered one of Mexico’s most violent and fastest-growing crime syndicates.</p>
<p>In an interview with Mexico’s Milenio news outlet, the younger Oseguera’s Mexican attorney, Víctor Beltran, said his client denied the allegations and accused U.S. authorities of inventing charges against Mr. Oseguera.</p>
<p>Washington has offered a $10 million reward for help in capturing the elder Oseguera, who has long eluded arrest in Mexico.</p>
<p>The younger Oseguera, who was born in the United States, faces drug-trafficking and other charges in federal court in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>IS supporter pleads guilty in bomb plot</strong></p>

<p>She also shared terrorist documents through groups using the Telegram messaging app between August 2019 and October 2019.</p>

<p><strong>France promises aid after poor ski season</strong></p>
<p>After slamming a French ski resort in the Pyrenees for helicoptering in snow to cover its bare slopes, French Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne is promising to help mountain resorts deal with the effects of climate change and ever-warmer winters.</p>
<p>In a “constructive” meeting with Ms. Borne late Thursday, ski-industry representatives agreed airlifting snow isn’t sustainable and best avoided, said Laurent Reynaud, general delegate at industry group Domaines Skiables de France. The government will put together a plan in the next six months for affected mountain resorts, it said after the meeting.</p>
<p>“Climate change is already a reality in our resorts,” said Mr. Reynaud. He said Ms. Borne understands the stakes, and the meeting allowed for a broad discussion on how to make mountain resorts sustainable. “It’s not enough to say, ‘there will be less snow.‘ We have to adapt, we have to change.”</p>
<p>France is one of the world’s three top skiing destinations with around 10 million annual visitors, vying for the lead with Austria and the U.S.</p>
