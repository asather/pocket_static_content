<h1>Penn State athletics hits pause on 'several' programs after latest COVID-19 report</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State said Wednesday that “several” sports have hit pause on team activities after the athletic department reported that 48 athletes tested positive for COVID-19 out of 920 tests conducted from Aug. 31 through Sept. 4.</p>
<p>Penn State has reported the results of department-wide tests for athletes each week since the fall semester began. Before that, starting in July, reports came on a bi-weekly basis.</p>
<p>The school two positive athlete tests for the previous two testing periods (Aug. 24-28 and Aug. 17-21).&nbsp;Penn State doesn’t designate gender nor sport when reporting positive tests. Penn State also didn’t say which athletic workouts were paused or how long the pause would last.</p>
<p>“These results represent a 5% positivity rate for Penn State athletics and have set in motion many of our established protocols. Based on these results and out of an abundance of caution, Penn State athletics has paused team activities for several programs and initiated standard isolation and precautionary quarantine,” the athletic department said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Contact tracing is being performed, and there is no evidence to suggest COVID-19 was transmitted during practice or training activities.”</p>
<p>Athletes, including football players, began their phased return to campus in early June, and last month the Big Ten Conference announced it was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/psu/2020/08/11/big-ten-fall-seasons-postponement/stories/202008110122" target="_blank">postponing fall sports</a> due to the pandemic.&nbsp;Wednesday’s news comes less than a week after officials said <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/09/04/Penn-State-University-COVID-19-coronavirus-fall-classes-infection-Barron-colleges-online/stories/202009040128" target="_blank">the school plans to&nbsp;weigh</a> a temporary or sustained switch to remote learning this fall after a near tripling of COVID-19 cases, nearly all of them on the main University Park campus.</p>
<p>That increase was among several reported in recent days by Pennsylvania colleges, something that has the attention of Gov. Tom Wolf. Schools including Temple and Bloomsburg universities had infection totals into the hundreds as of late last week.</p>
<p>“The administration is concerned and is monitoring cases and outbreaks linked to campuses,” said Lyndsay Kensinger, spokeswoman for the governor.</p>
<p>“We know the virus is here, and I am of course concerned by the numbers and trends we are seeing,” Penn State President Eric Barron said last week. “Our ability to manage transmission and rate of growth of positive cases is critically important.</p>
<p>“Next week, we will assess data following the holiday weekend, and determine whether we need to take mitigation steps at University Park including temporary or sustained remote learning.”</p>
