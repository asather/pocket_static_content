<p>The Pittsburgh Marathon is officially off.</p>
<p>Organizers for Pittsburgh Three Rivers Marathon, Inc., which is in charge of the marathon, announced Tuesday that the race weekend scheduled for May 1-3 has been canceled because of the city’s ban on gatherings of 50 or more people aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“All of us at P3R are disappointed and frustrated that this year’s DICK’S Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon has been canceled,” Troy Schooley, CEO of the marathon’s organizing group, said in a statement. “But we know that this is really the only decision the City of Pittsburgh could make given the current environment and that it’s the right thing to do to ensure the safety of our participants, staff, volunteers, medical professionals, security personnel and spectators.”</p>
<p>Organizers said <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pittsburgh-marathon/2020/03/16/pittsburgh-marathon-status-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak-running-clubs/stories/202003160096" target="_blank">as recently as Sunday</a> that they were proceeding with plans to run the race as scheduled. But as many things in Pittsburgh and beyond amid the COVID-19 pandemic, plans changed.</p>
<p>Instead, participants will be given the option to run the race virtually — meaning at home or in a safe place from which they can submit their time — and will receive race gear including a medal, an event shirt and sunglasses.&nbsp;If participants cannot complete the race virtually, they can also opt for a refund of their registration fee.</p>
<p>Many of the large run clubs preparing for the marathon had already canceled group runs even before the race was officially called off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelly Walburn, director of the Pro Bike + Run club, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Monday that many of her members had been preparing for the race since December and recently ramped up training runs to as much as 20 miles on weekends. She added that she didn’t know what most of them will do now, considering races elsewhere are also likely to be canceled — or have been canceled — in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>“It really kind of depends how much training you’ve invested in this particular race,” Walburn said.&nbsp;“If it’s just a training to make it to a six-mile relay leg, then people will probably just continue to run as usual. But it it’s someone who’s running a first-time marathon and they’ve built up a distance tolerance for the last 3-4 months, then they have some bigger decisions to make.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Honestly, I think that decision is as personal as the array of runners that we have in our group.”</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh cancellation is far from the first change to a major race. Last week, the Boston Marathon was pushed back to September.&nbsp;In recent days, the Rome Marathon was canceled, the Paris Marathon was postponed from April 5 to Oct. 18 and the Barcelona Marathon was postponed from March 15 to Oct. 25, all over concerns around COVID-19.</p>
<p>This month’s Tokyo Marathon was expected to have 38,000 participants but was limited to elite runners due to concerns over the outbreak of the virus in Japan. And spectators at the Los Angeles Marathon, held earlier this month, were advised to practice social distancing.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people — from 47 states, two U.S. territories and 23 countries — descended on Downtown last year for Pittsburgh Marathon events. Craig Davis, then-president and CEO of VisitPittsburgh told KDKA last year that his organization estimated direct spending of more than $13 million related to the event, which was revived in 2009 after having been defunct since 2003.</p>
<p>For that reason, losing the event this year will likely take a toll on the area’s economy. Still, local tourism officials are supportive of the decision.</p>
<p>“I understand runners and fans of the DICK’s Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon are disappointed by today’s cancellation, but this is the appropriate move given the current situation,” Jennifer Hawkins, executive director of SportsPittsburgh said in a statement to the Post-Gazette on Tuesday. “I know that this decision was made with the health and safety of the athletes, staff, volunteers and all who support the marathon in mind. I applaud the marathon staff and the P3R board of directors for providing a virtual race option and moving forward with the awarding of medals and gear.”</p>
