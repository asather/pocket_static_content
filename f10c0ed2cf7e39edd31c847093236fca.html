<p>Testimony in the case against Cheron Shelton, 32, of Lincoln-Lemington and Robert Thomas, 31, of Homewood is scheduled to begin Feb. 3 before Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski.</p>
<p>Attorneys on Wednesday selected two jurors, bringing the total to 11. The people chosen on Wednesday included a man who works as an architect and a woman who works in nursing. The panel includes six men and five women.</p>
<p>If either or both of the defendants are found guilty of first-degree murder, the case will move into a penalty phase, where the jurors must decide on a sentence of life in prison with no chance for parole or capital punishment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Judge Borkowski dismissed a juror who had been seated during the first week of selection. No reason for the dismissal was given in open court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shelton and Thomas are accused of killing Jerry Michael Shelton, 35, Brittany Powell, 27, and Chanetta Powell, 25, who was eight months pregnant, Tina Shelton, 37, and Shada Mahone, 26, during a cookout on Franklin Avenue on March 9, 2016.</p>
