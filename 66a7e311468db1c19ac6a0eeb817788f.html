<h1>Penn State students hold candlelight vigil for closed Taco Bell</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>They showed up with signs. They showed up with candles. They showed up with heavy hearts.</p>
<p>One even showed up in a taco costume.</p>
<p>That was the scene Sunday night as dozens of Penn State University students gathered in front of a Taco Bell near campus that had recently shut its doors.</p>
<p>The students mourned the late night College Avenue food spot by holding a vigil that started out as an idea on Facebook, and turned into a nationally trending topic on social media.</p>
<p>“Join us as we spice things up outside of our beloved downtown food establishment,” the “Taco Bell Vigil” Facebook event created by computer science major&nbsp;Prajesh Patel read. “Being one of the best spots to spend a late night out, Taco Bell can never be replaced,” organizers wrote.</p>
<p>The vigil was organized about six days prior, and word quickly spread around campus as Penn State’s own <a href="https://www.collegian.psu.edu/news/borough/article_ca5b92ee-590e-11ea-acb1-cf2cec040fd3.html" target="_blank">Daily Collegian newspaper promoted the event</a>.</p>
<p>Video of the ceremony that spread around social media shows students holding flowers, giving speeches, and laying candles in front of the closed fast-food establishment. Taco Bell’s own twitter shared a video to its account writing “Gone, but never forgotten.”</p>
<p>Students also played somber music like "See You Again” by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth, “In The Arms of the Angel” by Sarah McLachlan, according to the Daily Collegian.</p>
<p>The Taco Bell opened on College Avenue in 2011. It was not clear what caused the restaurant to board up its doors.</p>
<p>This is not the first ever vigil held for a closed Taco Bell. In 2018, patrons in Montgomery, Alabama, held a mock ceremony after a Taco Bell location caught fire and burned down, according to <a href="https://time.com/5113535/taco-bell-montgomery-fake-vigil/" target="_blank">TIME</a>.</p>
