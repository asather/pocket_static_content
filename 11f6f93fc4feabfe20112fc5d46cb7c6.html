<h1>Latrobe takes down Hempfield in Penguins Cup semifinals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Both Hempfield and Latrobe were among the PIHL Class 2A leaders in goals scored during the regular season, so there’s no doubt both can put the puck in the net.</p>
<p>But when the two met in the Penguins Cup semifinals at Robert Morris University Island Sports Center, it was a stalwart defensive performance that lifted the Wildcats into their first title game since 2017.</p>
<p>Latrobe goaltender Greg Irons tuned aside 22 of the 24 shots he faced, including six in the third period as Latrobe clamped down in the neutral zone, as the Wildcats pulled out a 3-2 victory over their Southeast Division rivals.</p>
<p>“That was just the mentality we had,” Latrobe forward Alex Walker said. “We just tried to regroup and got back to doing what we were trying to do out there and that’s what really pulled us through to the end of the game.”</p>
<p>Walker scored the first two goals of the game, but after Hempfield tied it up, it was Alex Schall, who deflected a Lane Ruffner point shot past Hempfield goaltender Joe Behler at 6:37 of the third period for what turned out to be the game-winning goal.</p>
<p>Cole Ferri assisted on all three Latrobe goals and got the puck out to the point for the original shot.</p>
<p>“I saw the puck go up to the blue line and I was just trying to get in front of the net and put a stick on it and it ended up going in,” Schall said. “I was excited and it’s nice to finally get over the hump and get there.”</p>
<p>Latrobe looked like it might have an easy night after Walker scored his second of the game just 39 seconds into the second period to give the Wildcats a 2-0 lead. But Matt Traczynski beat Greg Irons from the low slot at 5:31, then Nicholas Bruno tied it on a breakaway just 57 seconds later and the two teams went into the third period tied, 2-2.</p>
<p>“They made an adjustment between the second and third periods, we knew they were going to make that adjustment and I think they did the best they could and they adjusted to us and that’s how it works,” Hempfield coach Eric Grant said. “If you had four goals against that team, you’d still have to play the full game, just like you would against us.”</p>
<p>After the tying goal, Latrobe clamped down on the Hempfield attack. The Spartans had 10 shots in the first period, but only mustered 14 the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Conversely, Latrobe peppered Behler with 44 shots, 36 of which came over the final two stanzas.</p>
<p>“As a coach, that’s definitely what you want,” Latrobe coach Josh Werner said. “You want to play a tight one-goal game, we can and, if you want to run-and-gun, we’ll play it. We’re able to play anything.”</p>
<p><strong>Other game</strong></p>
<p><strong>Baldwin 3, Mars 2 (OT):</strong> Noah Fischer scored at 4:41 of overtime to send the Highlanders into the championship game. Baldwin has not won a title since 1988. Baldwin led, 2-1, into the third period on goals by Joey Jacobs and Zach Pender, but Wes Scurci tallied the equalizer and sent it to overtime when he beat Highlanders netminder Tanner Cindrich at 9:22 of the third period.</p>
