<h1>Dormont brothers create 'Virus Protection Kit' to benefit Broadway star Nick Cordero</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While bells are ringing for front-line workers, people are singing with the hashtag #WakeUpNick to show their support for Nick Cordero. The Tony-nominated actor has been in an induced coma for a month and had his leg amputated last week due to complications from COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two Dormont brothers and natives have come up with another way to help — raising funds by selling Virus Protection Kits with masks, hand sanitizer, wipes and disposable gloves.</p>
<p>Ted Brunetti, who was Cordero’s castmate in “A Bronx Tale” on Broadway, asked his brother Joseph — a designer for Crocs Shoes, Tommy Hilfiger and Bath &amp; Body Works, as well as virus protection products for Whole Foods —&nbsp;to help him come up with fundraiser for the Cordero family, including wife Amanda Kloots and infant son Elvis.</p>
<p>The brothers also have two sisters who are nurses, “so supplying protective products was already a labor of love,” Joseph said. In early April, he partnered with Andy Berliner, the founder of Amy’s Kitchen, and donated thousands of masks to nurses throughout the country.</p>
<p>The Brunettis have worked “day and night” for a month to gather all the components, according to a news release.&nbsp;While Joseph handled the design and production, Ted created a website to take orders.</p>
<p>“My brother and I are so proud of this project, which we created to help our dear friend and his family while also providing a product that everyone can use,” Joseph Brunetti said via email.</p>
<p>The Brunettis were moved by Cordero’s ordeal, which has been chronicled on social media by Kloots.&nbsp;The star of shows such as&nbsp;“Bullets Over Broadway” and&nbsp;“Waitress” was admitted into ICU and diagnosed with the new coronavirus on March 31. Kloots has continued to post updates on her Instagram, while fans and fellow actors continue to sing and share prayers using #WakeUpNick.&nbsp;</p>
