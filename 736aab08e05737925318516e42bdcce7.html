<h1>Boisterous crowd sends Pitt a noontime message: Divest from fossil fuels holdings</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>About 125 students and others waved signs and broke into chants outdoors at the University of Pittsburgh during a protest Thursday demanding Pitt vote this month to shed fossil fuel holdings in it $4.3 billion endowment.</p>
<p>Speaking from a Cathedral of Learning balcony from which a large orange Divest sign was draped, activists working with the Fossil Free Pitt Coalition delivered a series of speeches, some of which accused university leadership of being complicit in, and profiting from, harm being done to the environment by coal, gas, oil and related fuels.</p>
<p>The noon-hour crowd made noise but did not disrupt people coming or going from the Cathedral of Learning’s Bigelow Boulevard entrance.</p>
<p>Some in the gathering repeated shouts of, “We’re gonna win!” and held signs with messages that included, “People over Profits” and “I’d rather be in school but this is important.”</p>
<p>Thursday’s protest rally was the latest in a five-year campaign by a collection of campus groups and community activists. They are looking to the Feb. 28 Pitt trustees meeting on the Oakland campus for a commitment to divest.</p>
<p>The rally coincided with Fossil Fuel Divestment Day, in which 50 student campaigns across the world were to call on universities to divest from such holdings, Pittsburgh organizers said.</p>
<p>Pitt has stopped short of committing to divest, but its chancellor, Patrick Gallagher, said following a 2018 study on the issue that the school would create an approach for socially responsible investing.</p>
<p>Pitt has said it is committed to fighting climate change and is weighing investment policy changes In order to take into account environmental, social and governance factors.</p>
<p>In September, Pitt spokesman Kevin Zwick said: “Our chief financial officer is working toward the goal of presenting the environmental, social and governance criteria to the investment committee of the Board of Trustees for consideration by February.”</p>
