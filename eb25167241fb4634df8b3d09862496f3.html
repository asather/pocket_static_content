<h1>HBO to offer 'Watchmen' among free content featuring Black voices, storytellers this weekend</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This weekend, HBO presents a marathon of the Peabody-winning series “Watchmen” beginning at 1 p.m. June 19. It will show all nine episodes of Damon Lindelof’s history-bending series, which weaves the 1921 Greenwood massacre through its sci-fi story of a vigilante detective played by Regina King.</p>
<p>The series takes on the subject of systemic racism in America, beginning with the true story of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/hbo-2019/the-massacre-of-black-wall-street/3217/" target="_blank">Greenwood</a>. In 1921, the Ku Klux Klan and a mob of White rioters killed between 100-300 citizens of this Tulsa, Oklahoma, neighborhood.</p>

<p>Greenwood had been a self-sufficient part of the city, often referred to as “Black Wall Street.” Stores, churches and government centers were burned and looted. More than 9,000 were left homeless, and thousands were sent to internment camps for weeks. Bodies were buried in mass graves.</p>
<p>HBO is highlighting Black experiences, voices and storytellers with content available at HBO.com and On Demand. Expanded titles include&nbsp;“Being Serena,”&nbsp;“Bessie,”&nbsp;“Whoopi Goldberg Presents Moms Mabley,”&nbsp;“The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,”&nbsp;“The Apollo” and one episode each of “Treme” and “True Detective.”&nbsp;</p>
