<p>An infant has died in the hospital after a shooting in Pittsburghâ€™s Spring Hill neighborhood Monday evening.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police responded just after 6 p.m. to calls and a ShotSpotter alert of shots fired in the 100 block of Rhine Place. When they arrived, officers were directed to a nearby residence where they found a 1-year-old boy with a gunshot wound to his head.</p>
<p>Police immediately transported the infant to a hospital in critical condition, with two officers sitting in the backseat of a cruiser with the baby, attempting to control the bleeding.</p>
<p>Officials said that the 1-year-old was pronounced dead at the hospital several hours later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police say that the initial investigation shows that the shots emanated from the outside, then traveled through a window and two walls before hitting the infant.</p>
<p>VCU and homicide detectives are investigating. No arrests have yet been made.</p>
