<h1>Pirates place Kevin Newman on 10-day IL with bruised knee</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The bad news for the Pirates is that Kevin Newman’s season is over.</p>
<p>The good news is that there was no structural damage to his left knee, and the infielder won’t need offseason surgery.</p>
<p>Newman was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/09/19/kevin-newman-derek-shelton-injury-pirates-cardinals/stories/202009190099" target="_blank">hit in the left knee</a> with a 97-mph fastball from Cardinals reliever Genesis Cabrera in the ninth inning of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/09/19/Bullpen-spoils-Mitch-Keller-no-hit-bid-in-Pirates-loss-5-4-St-Louis-Cardinals/stories/202009190100" target="_blank">Saturday’s 5-4 loss</a>. On Sunday afternoon, the Pirates placed Newman on the 10-day injured list with a contusion to the peroneal nerve of his left knee.</p>
<p>Derek Shelton said X-rays came back negative, though the Pirates manager said Newman was in a bunch of pain.</p>
<p>Thus ends a frustrating season for Newman, who finishes with a slash line of .224/.281/.276, down significantly from .308/.353/.446 in 2019, his first full season in the major leagues.</p>
<p>Newman also made a team-high seven errors in 44 games, as he bounced between shortstop and second base.</p>
