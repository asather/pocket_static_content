<h1>Donnie Shell never lost faith that he would make the Pro Football Hall of Fame</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Donnie Shell was a four-time All-Pro and a four-time Super Bowl winner with the Steelers. He was known from his first training camp practice as a fearsome hitter and that would remain his calling card throughout his career (just ask Earl Campbell).</p>
<p>Shell’s coverage skills were underappreciated. Former Steelers defensive coordinator George Perles discovered that this former college linebacker could play slot corner in addition to strong safety and implemented him as a key piece in the “Steel Curtain” defense. Shell would finish his 14-year NFL career with 51 interceptions.</p>
<p>So when Shell fell off the ballot of the Pro Football Hall of Fame selectors in recent years, he wasn’t the least bit concerned. He figured, in time, his career would be recognized.</p>
<p>“The one thing that kept me going was my faith,” Shell said Thursday morning. “I had faith they would make the right decision. I never lost confidence. The [Hall of Fame] bylaws say it’s your body of work. I had a 14-year career. There was nothing I could do. The hay was in the barn. You could pout. You could be sad. You could be disappointed. I was never that. I thought when my time came, I would be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.”</p>
<p>Shell’s dream was realized Wednesday morning when he was officially inducted into the hall. He will be enshrined during a ceremony in Canton, Ohio, later this summer with the rest of the centennial class, the 15 new Hall of Famers who were chosen by a blue-ribbon panel in conjunction with the NFL’s 100 anniversary. The other five members of the 20 for ’20 class will be chosen the day before the Super Bowl next month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s been a hectic couple of days for Shell. He was informed by Hall of Fame president and CEO David Baker of his election by a phone call Monday night. He flew to New York the next day and appeared on the NFL Network’s “Good Morning Football” show Wednesday morning when the class was unveiled to the public.</p>
<p>Shell then spent the better part of Wednesday fielding phone calls from former teammates. Joe Greene, Franco Harris, Mel Blount, Tony Dungy and John Stallworth were some of who phoned in congratulations.</p>
<p>Shell’s teammates and the Steelers organization did their best to keep his name relevant in the Hall of Fame discussion after he had fallen off the ballot. The panel that eventually elected him was comprised of Hall of Famers, former NFL executives and Hall of Fame selectors.</p>
<p>“Tony was a great advocate for me,” said Shell of Dungy, his old roommate at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, where the Steelers still hold preseason practices. “John Stallworth, Franco, Joe Greene. … When I read their words, it brought tears to my eyes. It was like we were back playing again. I was happy for the way they advocated for me.”</p>
<p>Shell became the 10th Steelers player from the four Super Bowl teams of the 1970s to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Five played offense and five played defense. And five of them — Shell, Stallworth, Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert and Mike Webster — arrived in the same year, 1974.</p>
<p>“It’s great to look back,” Shell said. “When you’re playing, you don’t have time to look at it. When you’re out of the game and look back at what we did, it was an awesome accomplishment. Not only did we have great players; we had great people.”</p>
<p>Shell, who played for the Steelers from 1974-87, said he had three special memories from his time in Pittsburgh:</p>
<p>• His three-interception game against Cleveland quarterback Brian Sipe on Nov. 23, 1981.</p>
<p>• His bone-crushing hit on Earl Campbell on Dec. 3, 1978, that knocked the future Hall of Fame running back out of a game the Steelers won in the Astrodome.</p>
<p>• Watching Steelers founder Art Rooney, “The Chief,” be presented with the Lombardi Trophy on Jan. 12, 1975, after the Steelers won their first Super Bowl against the Vikings.</p>
