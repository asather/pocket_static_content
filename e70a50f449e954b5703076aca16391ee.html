<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — The seats at Nationwide Arena — all 20,000 of them — will be empty when the Penguins visit the Columbus Blue Jackets on Thursday night. Well, that’s assuming the game gets played at all.</p>
<p>Wednesday night, the NBA announced that it was suspending its season&nbsp;“until further notice” following Wednesday night’s games. That stunning news came minutes after multiple media outlets, including ESPN, reported that Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert, an All-Star player, had tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Pressure is now building for other North American professional sports leagues to follow suit. The NHL said late Wednesday it will have an update Thursday.</p>
<p>“The National Hockey League is aware of the NBA’s decision to indefinitely suspend its season due to a player testing positive for the coronavirus,” an NHL statement read. “The NHL is continuing to consult with medical experts and is evaluating the options. We expect to have a further update [Thursday].”</p>
<p>The Penguins are awaiting word on whether they will play Thursday’s game in Columbus. If they do, it will be inside a mostly empty Nationwide Arena.</p>
<p>The Blue Jackets announced in a statement Wednesday that amid concern over the spread of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, admission to Thursday’s game in Columbus will be limited to home and visiting club personnel, credentialed media and broadcast partners, essential club and arena staff, and NHL officials.</p>
<p>So the game, the statement read, will be closed to the public.</p>
<p>The Blue Jackets’ statement about Thursday’s game was released hours after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that an order prohibiting mass gatherings in the state of Ohio was forthcoming.</p>
<p>“We have been in contact with the National Hockey League regarding this matter and will abide by the state’s mandate,” the Blue Jackets stated. “Remaining home games while the order is in effect ... will be played as scheduled, but with restricted attendance in compliance with [Wednesday’s] announcement.”</p>
<p>The Blue Jackets were the first NHL team to announce that they would close one of their home games to the public due to COVID-19. The San Jose Sharks soon followed suit, announcing an hour later that their next three home games will be played as scheduled at SAP Center but will be closed to the general public.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/03/11/Only-essential-staff-and-limited-family-at-NCAA-basketball-tournaments/stories/202003110148" target="_blank">NCAA also announced</a> that this month’s men’s and women’s basketball tournaments would be played without fans in the arenas, as well.</p>
<p>Media access to the Penguins had wrapped up prior to the Blue Jackets’ announcement. But asked Saturday about the possibility, captain Sidney Crosby said it “absolutely” would be strange to play an NHL game in an empty arena.</p>
<p>“We’ve discussed kind of the situation and, you know, been brought up to speed on what’s going on,” he said after Saturday’s loss to Washington. “But I haven’t given any thought to that. Couldn’t give you an opinion either way.”</p>
<p>The Penguins, for now, say their next home game will be open to the public.</p>
<p>The Penguins on Wednesday released a statement that read that they are “aware of the most recent guidance and recommendations from the Allegheny County Health Department” and that their next game at PPG Paints Arena, Sunday against the New York Islanders, will go on as scheduled in front of fans.</p>
<p>The Penguins said that in response to “growing awareness and concern” over COVID-19, elevated safety procedures will be implemented. They include sanitary gloves worn by food handlers, ticket takers, ushers and suite attendants; cleaning and sanitizing of public areas; and hand sanitizers placed around the arena.</p>
<p>The team’s statement added: “As a reminder, guests who are feeling sick; who have traveled to or have been in contact with travelers to high-risk areas; or who have serious underlying health issues, such as respiratory or cardiac conditions, should not attend events at PPG Paints Arena until further notice.”</p>
<p>The Penguins said they will remain in regular contact with health agencies, the NHL and other authorities for continued advice and direction, and any additional information that becomes available will be communicated to the public.</p>
<p>The news that Thursday’s game in Columbus will be closed to the public came two days after the NHL, in a joint agreement with three other North American professional sports leagues, announced they would <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/09/NBA-NHL-MLB-MLS-coronavirus-covid-19-locker-rooms/stories/202003090137" target="_blank">close access to locker rooms</a> and clubhouses to all non-essential personnel in response to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>The NHL, NBA, MLB and Major League Soccer said Monday that they made the decision “after consultation with infectious disease and public health experts.”</p>
<p>After the Penguins practiced Wednesday at Nationwide Arena, a few players took off their gear and walked to a staged media area. Three tables were set up in the place of lecterns and black pieces of tape were put down on the floor about six feet away. Media members stood behind those lines during the interviews.</p>
<p>“This is weird,” Justin Schultz said, summing up that scene for all involved.</p>
<p>Prior to Wednesday’s announcement, the NHL had urged players to limit contact with fans, suggesting they avoid handshakes, close contact and autographs. The league had also previously implemented a policy that stated that league office employees are banned from traveling outside of the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>“We’ve been told to limit our interaction with fans and stuff like that, which is really unfortunate,” blue-liner Jack Johnson said Saturday. “That’s just kind of the world we live in right now. Everyone is going to do their best to not get it. I don’t know if there’s much we can do about it. But you might as well try your best.”</p>
<p>With Thursday’s game at Nationwide Arena closed to the public due to fears over the spread of the COVID-19, the Penguins won’t have to worry about interacting with fans. But as they wait for the NHL to announce how the league will proceed, players are wondering if they’ll suit up for a hockey game anytime soon.</p>
