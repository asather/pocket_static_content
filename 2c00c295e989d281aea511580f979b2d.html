<p>Here’s how events are unfolding today:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11:43 a.m.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trump followed established U.S. policy in holding Ukraine aid, White House lawyers say</strong></p>
<p>Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Mr. Trump, pointed to several other instances in 2018 and 2019 that Mr. Trump decided to freeze or renegotiate military aid to other countries. Aid was held in those cases, he said, due to concerns that those countries were not sharing enough of the burden in fighting corruption, terrorism or other problems identified by U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Aid was withheld to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, El Salvador and South Korea, he listed, citing sworn testimony by Fiona Hill, a Russia expert formerly at the National Security Council, before the House Intelligence Committee in November.</p>
<p>Therefore, they argued, Mr. Trump acted within his right to question the nearly $400 million in military aid due to Ukraine.</p>
<p>"To say the president of the United States was not concerned about burden-sharing, that he was not concerned about corruption in Ukraine ... the facts establish exactly the opposite," Mr. Sekulow said.</p>
<p>White House lawyers have also claimed Ukrainian officials could have felt no pressure because they were unaware of the hold on U.S. aid at the time of Mr. Zelensky's July 25 phone call with Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>White House deputy counsel Mike Purpura pointed to public statements from Mr. Zelensky that publicly described that conversation “good phone call” and “normal” and insisted that “nobody pushed him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10:37 a.m.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trump’s phone call transcript at center of debate as White House opens arguments</strong></p>
<p>The White House legal team opened arguments in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial by saying Mr. Trump did “nothing wrong” and House Democrats “hid evidence” in the last three days that would have proved the president’s innocence.</p>
<p>‘They have the burden of proof, and they have not come close to meeting it,” White House Counsel Pat A. Cipollone said the session began in front of all 100 senators.</p>
<p>In the opening minutes, Mr. Trump’s defense focused on a summary of Mr. Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that the White House released last September.</p>
<p>Democrats have argued that Mr. Trump abused his power by freezing nearly $400 million in security aid and withholding a coveted White House meeting in an attempt to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, an opponent in this year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>But Mr. Cipollone said that conclusion was wrong, that Democrats refused to share the fact that two leaders discussed broad anti-corruption efforts and U.S. efforts to push Europe to do more to help Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Yes you are absolutely right,” Mr. Zelensky told Mr. Trump, according to the White House summary of the call, read aloud by Mr. Cipollone. “Not only 100%, but actually 1000%.”</p>
<p>Mr. Zelensky went on to say he had recently told German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron “they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing. … I'm very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The White House strategy attempts to rebut House Democrats’ central claim that Mr. Trump cared only about his re-election prospects and diverged from established U.S. foreign policy in temporarily freezing the aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Every time you see one of these pieces of evidence, ask yourself: Why didn’t I see that in the last three days?” Mr. Cipollone said.</p>
<p>The argument will likely play to Senate Republicans — who have been skeptical of the Democrats’ arguments — while failing to convince Senate Democrats.</p>
<p>Shortly before the session began, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., weighed in on Twitter to “implore the White House counsel to present a substantive argument as to why the president shouldn’t be impeached.”</p>
<p>“Don’t continue to insult the country by saying he did nothing wrong,” Mr. Casey wrote.</p>
