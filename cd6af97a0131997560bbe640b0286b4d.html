<h1>Three arrested after leaving drugs, needles accessible to children</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three people were arrested after police searched a Marshall-Shadeland house where drugs and needles were kept next to childrens’ toys, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>John Malick, 52, Zackary Malick, 28, and Nicole Talerico, 26, were charged Friday with prohibited acts and endangering the welfare of children.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, officers arrived with a search warrant at the Marshall-Shadeland home at 9:12 a.m. The three suspects were inside the home with two children.</p>
<p>A complaint describes the living conditions as “deplorable” and&nbsp;“unsafe,” filled with trash, old food, animal feces and crawling with bugs.</p>
<p>Drugs and paraphernalia were easily accessible to children, court documents said. A bedroom mattress was stained and covered in dirt, and pills were scattered on the dining room floor. Inside a playroom, an uncapped syringe was found next to a sippy cup.</p>
<p>Officers found several empty stamp bags of heroin and another syringe —&nbsp;“sticking up in the air” — in the same room as a baby doll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While authorities waited for workers from the Office of Children, Youth and Families, one of the children said she was hungry, the complaint reads. When officers looked inside the refrigerator, there was nothing inside except an open pack of hot dogs and water. In the freezer, there was a crack pipe next to a box of waffles.</p>
<p>The children were taken by CYF workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zackary Malick and Talerico were both charged with possession of drugs and endangering children in June 2016, court records show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three suspects are in Allegheny County Jail. Their preliminary hearing is set for Feb. 21.&nbsp;</p>
