<h1>Benny Snell bent on being better-built back for Steelers in Year 2</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One rep after another, Mike Tomlin wanted to see No. 24 in the drill, and Benny Snell obliged. In what Tomlin has called a&nbsp;“featured” competition period in camp, with running backs facing off against linebackers or defensive backs in open field, Snell ran past, around and sometimes through the defender, often with attitude.</p>
<p>“With Pittsburgh being a really gritty town and a hard-nosed, blue-collar people —&nbsp;not really flashy and things like that — I&nbsp;could see, sometimes, how they could misperceive Benny,” Kash Daniel, Snell’s teammate and classmate at Kentucky, was saying last week. “But at the end of the day, Benny’s the hardest-working football player I’ve been around.”</p>
<p>Snell and Daniel have been tight since they arrived at Kentucky together as cornerstone recruits in 2016 and helped revitalize football in Lexington. They’d drive golf carts from practice back to their dorm as freshmen, Snell smiling wide as an instant star and Daniel living vicariously through him as a feisty linebacker limited to special teams duty.</p>
<p>So Daniel knows as well as anyone the transition Snell has had to go through since college. He went from being the biggest fish in an SEC pond to a rookie running back fighting for everything he got in the NFL.</p>
<p>“Just knowing Benny and how he is, I could see how he went from ‘The Man’ here in Kentucky to having to basically do it all over again to become the man there,” Daniel said. “But Benny’s not a guy to shy away from hard work, not a guy to shy away from a challenge.”</p>
<p>Daniel, a two-time captain for the Wildcats who went undrafted this year, has closely followed his friend with the Steelers. In fact, he immediately thinks back to last summer and a clip he saw on Twitter from the annual&nbsp;“Friday Night Lights” practice at Latrobe Memorial Stadium during training camp.</p>
<p>Snell is facing off against first-round pick Devin Bush in the team’s famous&nbsp;“backs on backers” blocking drill, and Bush steamrolls the fourth-rounder onto his back. Part of Daniel was actually glad to see it.</p>
<p>“Everybody was roasting him on social media during practice for getting run over, but that was probably one of the best things that could happen to Benny,” he said. “Because I’m sure it pissed him off and made him a better player.”</p>
<p>The Steelers saw flashes of that in Snell’s rookie year, such as his 75-yard breakout in a win at the Chargers, his 98 yards in a victory at Cincinnati and even his 91 yards and a touchdown in a losing effort at Baltimore in the season finale. They’re seeing more of it now this training camp, with a reshaped Snell minus 12 pounds to 212 running with more burst, same power.</p>
<p>Daniel and Snell met up in the offseason <a href="https://kentuckysportsradio.com/football-2/watch-benny-snell-and-kash-daniel-star-in-new-local-commercial/" target="_blank">to film a commercial</a> for the UK Federal Credit Union in their college town. The first thing his old teammate told him?&nbsp;“Damn, man, you look pretty good.”<em>&nbsp;</em>Steelers players and coaches have been saying that all month, but Friday night, fans got to see it for themselves if they were watching the team’s live stream of practice.</p>
<p>In a scrimmage-like setting, Snell took a handoff to the left, got to the corner quickly, stiff-armed outside linebacker Ola Adeniyi and ran through safety John Battle before finally being taken out of bounds. Just like he’s been showing in those one-on-one competitions.</p>
<p>“Really, that’s a snapshot of what we want to see from everyone,” coach Mike Tomlin said afterward. “We want to do drills that are&nbsp;football-like, where we get an opportunity to work on certain aspects of play and display certain skills, but it’s only relevant if they can take those skills and talents to 11-on-11 football. ... Benny is showing those talents in drill work, but it’s showing up, more importantly,&nbsp;on the 11-on-11 stage.”</p>

<p>That was Snell’s whole goal in fine-tuning his physique this offseason, to improve his quickness, durability and even his top-end speed. This time last year, he averaged a whopping 1.9 yards per carry in the preseason, as sure a sign as any that he wasn’t quite ready for the speed of the pro game.</p>
<p>Once the regular season came and Snell was counted on more to spell starter James Conner, his reward was staring at defenses that had a pretty good hunch the Steelers were handing off to their hard-running rookie when he was in the game. According to NFL Next Gen Stats, Snell faced eight-plus defenders in the box on 39.8% of his rushes, second-most in the league. That’s partially due to his own lack of credentials as a pass-catcher, but the inexperience at quarterback last year didn’t help anyone in the ground game.</p>
<p>“It’s going to pick up tremendously,” Snell said. “Ben [Roethlisberger] is able to change the pace of the game, be able to&nbsp;make the calls at the line much quicker. It makes us all one when we’re out there. It’s huge that he’s back.”</p>
<p>From a lineman’s perspective, tackle-turned-guard Matt Feiler&nbsp;“wouldn’t necessarily say it was an issue” that Mason Rudolph and Devlin Hodges weren’t as adept at making tweaks pre-snap. But Feiler is impressed with the conditioning and maturity he has seen in Year 2 players, Snell included.</p>
<p>“You can kind of get a sense that they understand what’s expected of them and what we expect from&nbsp;them,” Feiler said. “They’ve made some changes to their bodies and their work ethic. They’re&nbsp;coming back healthy and ready to go.”</p>
<p>Which takes us back to this offseason for Snell, who was much more loquacious than the typical Steelers newcomer last spring. His catchphrases of&nbsp;“Snell Yeah!” and&nbsp;“Benny Snell Football” followed him from campus to camp, which left up to interpretation whether he was just a fun-loving 21-year-old or the next Steelers diva.</p>
<p>To hear it from Daniel, who knew him before the fame, Snell is much more outgoing than outsize ego. A Kentucky legend himself, Daniel insists he has never personally known a player who works harder, who’s so serious about football and who takes every snap — even in practice — so personally. In one Zoom interview, Snell wasn’t nearly as boisterous as he was last August, and didn’t once mention himself in third-person. It seems to be all in focus for him now, even if it was once viewed as arrogance.</p>
<p>“I can see how people could say that, with how his personality is, but that’s just Benny’s confidence,” Daniel said. “That’s something, as players, that a lot of people don't really understand. The way I look at it is it’s almost like wrestlers, in a sense, and how they get themselves hyped up. They have this persona and they have this character that allow them to go out there and perform in front of thousands and thousands of people.</p>
<p>“The altar ego of ‘Benny Snell Football’ or ‘Snell Yeah’ is the thing that perhaps gives him confidence to go out there and perform in front of Heinz Field’s finest.”</p>
