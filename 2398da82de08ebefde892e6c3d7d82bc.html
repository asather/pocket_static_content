<p>NFL fans have spoken, and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2019/02/05/immaculate-reception-franco-harris-steelers-greatest-plays-james-harrison-interception/stories/201902050092" target="_blank">the Immaculate Reception</a> stands the test of time.</p>
<p>During Fox’s pre-game show Sunday ahead of the 2020 Super Bowl, the famous Steelers play was announced as the greatest moment in NFL history as voted by fans to commemorate the league’s 100th season.</p>
<p>The play, of course, happened during an AFC divisional round playoff game between the Steelers and Raiders in 1972. Franco Harris’ improbable catch and score on fourth-and-10 lifted the Steelers to 13-7 win at Three Rivers Stadium.</p>
<p>“It is unbelievable how this play has stood the test of time," Harris told Steelers.com. "I would probably look at it this way. That play symbolized the spirit of winning, of never giving up and the unexpected can happen at the most unexpected time. I mention to people that The Chief, Mr. Art Rooney Sr., got on the elevator thinking we lost and when he got off, he got off a winner.”</p>
<p>The Steelers didn’t win the Super Bowl that year but went on to win four in six seasons in the 1970s and early 80s.</p>
<p>“When you look at what makes this so special, this started a string of playoff appearances and Super Bowl wins that never happened before in the NFL,” Harris told the website. “Do we connect that to that first playoff win? I think we do. It gave a feeling to us players that we now are one of the best teams in the league. We went on to show we were the best team in the league.</p>
<p>"This play started our first step into what was to become an incredible run that continues today."</p>
