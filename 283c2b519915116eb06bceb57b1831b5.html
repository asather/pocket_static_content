<h1>Pittsburgh Public Schools board endorses bills on charter school law reform</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools board on Wednesday voted in support of two bills on charter school law reform expected to be introduced in the Pennsylvania Legislature in the near future.</p>
<p>House Bill 2261 and Senate Bill 1024, which have identical language, aim to reform the way charter schools in the state are funded.</p>
<p>The bills would require that charter schools be reimbursed using the special education fair funding formula for special education students already used by public school districts. They also institute a statewide cyber charter school tuition rate.</p>
<p>"Charter school funding is, to me, something that's broken. The funding formula is broken," school board member Pam Harbin said. "We are overpaying charter schools for students, particularly students with disabilities."</p>
<p>Public school districts pays tuition for students who live in their districts but attend charter schools. The costs fluctuate from district to district, and they increase significantly for special education.</p>
<p>The state's charter school law and funding formula have not been substantially reformed since being instituted in 1997.</p>
<p>"It is incomprehensible that this has been going on for so long," school board member Bill Gallagher said. "I hope that the public realizes where their money is going. It is not going to the right place.”</p>
<p>School board member Sala Udin was absent, but all other members were present and approved supporting the bills.</p>
<p>The bills also require charter school trustee meetings to be conducted in accordance with the Sunshine Act, the same as public school board meetings. It also enforces the same financial ethic reporting requirements by charter school trustees and administrators as school board members and district officials.</p>
<p>State Rep. Joe Ciresi, D-Montgomery County, is sponsoring the House bill, while the Senate bill is being sponsored by state Sens. Jim Brewster, D-McKeesport, and Lindsey Williams, D-West View.</p>
<p>The cost-saving provisions in the bills are similar to those made in Gov. Tom Wolf’s 2021 budget proposal. Mr. Wolf said imposing the same special education funding formula used to distribute money to school districts on charter schools would save districts $147 million.</p>
<p>The governor also seeks to establish a flat $9,500 per student per year tuition rate that cyber charter schools can charge districts for educating students who reside within their borders. Currently, districts pay between $7,700 and $21,400 per student, because the rate is based on a percentage of what districts pay to educate their own students.</p>
<p>Ana Meyers, executive director of the Pennsylvania Coalition of Public Charter Schools, sent a letter this week to school board President Sylvia Wilson and other members of the board urging them not to endorse the bills.</p>
<p>The letter said that the children who would be most impacted by the bills would be charter school students who receive special education services.</p>
<p>“Our families support charter school reforms that are fair, not arbitrary spending cuts designed to reinstate school districts’ monopoly on public education,” the letter said. “It is clear that the intention of these lawmakers is not to enact legislation that is fair and beneficial for all public school students. If that was their goal, they would be collaborating with the charter school community to pass meaningful charter reform that strengthens accountability for charter schools and addresses the funding concerns of school districts, all while preserving charter school for the 143,000+ students who rely on these schools.”</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools 2020 budget showed that the district expected to spend about $102 million on charter school costs this year, accounting for about 15% of the overall budget.</p>
<p>"This comes down to common decency and fairness," Mr. Gallagher said.</p>
<p>The school board on Wednesday also approved a resolution to schedule additional budget planning workshops throughout the year to encourage public participation in the process and provide residents with opportunities to share their budget priorities to best serve students’ needs.</p>
