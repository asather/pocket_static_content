<h1>Pirates squander strong start from Joe Musgrove, lose 4th game in a row to Cardinals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If the Pirates’ season has felt like a bad dream, Sunday’s game was a recurring one.</p>
<p>For the second straight game against the St. Louis Cardinals, the Pirates got an impressive, six-inning outing from their starting pitcher. On Saturday, it was Mitch Keller’s hitless effort. On Sunday, it was Joe Musgrove striking out 11 batters — more than any Pirates pitcher this season.</p>
<p>And then the seventh inning came. It may not have been as drastic as Saturday, when two different Pirates relievers blew a four-run lead, but it was the same result. Left-hander Derek Holland pitched the seventh after Musgrove was finished, hanging onto a one-run lead. The first batter he faced, Matt Carpenter, ripped a single into left field, and the second, Yadier Molina drove a ball 389 feet over the left field wall for a two-run, go-ahead home run.</p>
<p>Yet again, the Pirates blew a lead in the seventh, and yet again, they could not manage another run in the remaining innings. On Sunday that meant a 2-1 loss in the series finale with the Cardinals. It is their fourth loss in a row and their 12th in the last 13 games.</p>
<p>“I was worried about myself today and my performance,” Musgrove said after the game. “I know the bullpen’s not going out there trying to give up games. Everyone’s doing what they can to do their part. I know that doesn’t feel good for Derek, but by no means, I don’t want him carrying the weight of me feeling upset about it as well. I know he’s down on himself about his performance tonight, but by no means am I upset for him blowing a win or loss at this point in the year, man.”</p>
<p>Musgrove’s start comes one outing after a tough, five inning, four-run loss to the Cincinnati Reds his last start. After that game, he discussed that he had to come out better at the beginnings of games. It fit into his theory that the Pirates’ starters could improve by getting deeper into games.</p>
<p>In the end, Musgrove did that, though someone expecting the worst may have been shaken in the first inning. The first batter Musgrove faced ripped a fly ball deep to the warning track in right field, but Gregory Polanco corralled it safely. After a strikeout to the next hitter, Cardinals first baseman Paul Goldschmidt smoked a single up the middle, the hardest-hit ball against Musgrove all game. The righty got the next batter looking to escape the first.</p>
<p>Then, he really started grooving. He struck out two Cardinals each in the second, third and sixth innings, and three in the fifth. The 11 combined strikeouts are the most of his career. The last Pirate to have more in a start was Jordan Lyles against the San Diego Padres in May 2019.</p>
<p>Not to mention, part of Musgrove’s point after the Reds loss was that the Pirates’ starters had just two quality starts all season to that point. This weekend, against the Cardinals alone, they had three.</p>
<p>That is encouraging for the Pirates. What isn’t encouraging is that they went 1-2 in those quality starts and 1-4 in the series overall.</p>
<p>“It's frustrating that we got out with one win,” manager Derek Shelton said. “In the long term of it, we had three really good starts that we're gonna build on, and that's a really good sign moving forward for our starters. I think those are the things we need to focus on. For us to win games, we're going to have to score runs, and we haven't scored runs. But on the pitching side, it's really positive.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, Holland gave up the game-winning homer, but the Pirates’ offense had just two hits all game. Their only run came on a double, a bunt and a sacrifice fly. Cardinals starter Jack Flaherty went toe to toe with Musgrove, and the Pirates had no answer at all.</p>
<p>It was the continuation of a trend when Musgrove pitches. In his seven starts this season, he has received a total of four runs of support from his offense. He has been matched up with opposing team’s aces in most of those starts, but the Pirates’ offense has been anemic, at best, in those seven games.</p>
<p>That was true again Sunday. In the bottom of the ninth, the Pirates brought the top of the order up against Cardinals lefty Andrew Miller. Center fielder Bryan Reynolds popped out to third base, second baseman Adam Frazier ground out to second and Colin Moran struck out weakly.</p>
<p>By that point, Musgrove’s start was rendered moot in terms of garnering a better team result, just as Keller’s had been the night before. With seven games left in the season, the Pirates are well outside the possibility of a playoff push. At this point, it’s just about improvement and hopefully waking themselves up from this nightmarish season.</p>
<p>“As much as you’d like to say, ‘Put it behind you, go out and win the next one,’ when you go through a week or two of poor performance, there is added pressure,” Musgrove said. “Because every year, you’re aiming for one goal, and every team’s aiming for that same goal. You feel yourself slipping and slipping farther away from that, you have no choice but to press. Things have to turn around at some point if you want to still have a chance to compete.</p>
<p>“I’m really hoping that in these last handful of games here, we can not take a selfish mindset but really look at our own careers and our own effort and mentality that we’re taking every day and try to improve on our own game and make strides to carry over into next year.”</p>
