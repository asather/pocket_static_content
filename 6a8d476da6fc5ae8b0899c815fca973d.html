<h1>Analysis: Are there outfield options out there for the Pirates?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates hired Ben Cherington in mid-November. He&nbsp;<em>really</em> became the Pirates’ general manager Monday.</p>
<p>Sure, Cherington hired a manager in Derek Shelton, assistant general manager Steve Sanders and a bunch of new coaches over the past couple months.</p>
<p>But Cherington’s tenure will start to be defined by what happens after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2020/01/27/starling-marte-trade-arizona-diamondbacks-pirates-next-steps-josh-bell/stories/202001280059" target="_blank">trading Starling Marte to the Arizona Diamondbacks</a> in exchange for two prospects (pitcher Brennan Malone and shortstop Liover Peguero) and $250,000 in international signing bonus pool money.</p>
<p>Marte’s eight-year career with the Pirates had its ups and downs, but his production won’t be easy to replace. We won’t know for a few years if the Pirates got a good return for the trade. What we do know is that Marte’s value was unlikely to get any higher.</p>
<p>Hate it or love it, the deal got done. Let’s get into what’s next for the Pirates.</p>
<p><strong>Outfield options</strong></p>
<p>Cherington told reporters this week that he does want to add another center fielder into the fold. The new GM said the Pirates are speaking to free agents and other teams for trades.</p>
<p>One intriguing name to watch is <strong>Michael A. Taylor</strong> of the Washington Nationals.</p>
<p>Taylor is a good defensive outfielder and a speedy base runner. He could be an everyday center fielder on most teams.</p>
<p>His problem in Washington, however, is that Victor Robles, who played in 155 games for the World Series champions last year, isn’t going anywhere. Taylor, who turns 29 next month, has a favorable contract ($3.3 million in 2020) that could be enticing for a team whose current payroll is projected to be around $50 million.</p>
<p>Another interesting name is Padres outfielder <strong>Manuel Margot</strong>,&nbsp;who has talent but hasn’t quite panned out in San Diego. The 25-year-old, who was sixth in National League Rookie of the Year voting in 2017, hit .234 with 12 homers and 37 RBIs last season and could benefit from a change of scenery. Margot also won’t be a free agent until 2023, which could allow the Pirates to acquire him for a discounted rate.</p>
<p>In terms of the free agent market, <strong>Kevin Pillar</strong> is one quality name still out there. The veteran is 31 but still moves well in the outfield and played 156 games for the San Francisco Giants last season.</p>
<p><strong>More moves?</strong></p>
<p>Trading Marte is a sign of a rebuild, even if the team won’t say it out loud.&nbsp;The question is, how intense will that rebuild be?</p>
<p>For instance, a deal involving your biggest star — All-Star first baseman<strong> Josh Bell</strong> — would signal a pretty intense one. But the Pirates are pretty deep at other infield positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adam Frazier</strong>, a Gold Glove finalist in 2019, has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/25/adam-frazier-trade-rumors-piratesfest-pittsburgh-2020/stories/202001250041" target="_blank">a decent amount of trade value</a>. The Pirates could move him, which would open up a spot for <strong>Cole Tucker</strong> to play every day at shortstop with<strong> Kevin Newman</strong> at second base.&nbsp;Cherington, however, said fans shouldn’t expect such a move at least before spring training.</p>
<p>• Reliever&nbsp;<strong>Keone Kela</strong> could fetch a decent return from a contending team, but he’s on the last year of his deal and teams may want to see him perform well in the first part of the season before making a move. At this point, there’s no rush to move Kela.</p>
<p>• <strong>Chris Archer</strong>’s struggles since joining the Pirates have been well documented. He went 3-9 with a 5.19 ERA in 2019. But Shelton and new pitching coach Oscar Marin are encouraged that Archer is ready to return to the form that made him a two-time&nbsp;All-Star&nbsp;in Tampa.</p>
<p>“The one thing about Chris Archer is he’s really good. But when he’s motivated, he’s even better,” Shelton said recently. “And I think ‘Arch’ thrives on people telling him he can’t do things. He’s going to prove to you that he can.</p>
<p>“I’m excited about Chris Archer this year. I’m excited talking to him, just knowing him as a person, hearing it in his voice, the way he is. I’m excited about where Arch is at.”</p>
<p>If Shelton and Marin are right, Archer, who has a team option on his deal for 2021, could evolve into a hot commodity at the deadline.</p>
<p>For now, though, it appears the Pirates will enter the season with a lot of familiar faces on the field. Time will tell how this team looks by the end of July.</p>
