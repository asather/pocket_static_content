<h1>Joe Starkey: Steelers to be trusted on WRs — but what about J.K. Dobbins?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Before we jump ahead to Steelers-Ravens drama, let’s go back to the very beginning. As it turns out, Round 2 of the NFL’s virtual draft was infinitely more entertaining than Round 1 …</p>
<p><strong>7:02 p.m.:</strong> ESPN opens with shots from players’ houses. Not a ton of social distancing happening, but at least it’s not like Thursday, when agent Drew Rosenhaus appeared in a player’s home wearing a mask around his <em>chin</em>.</p>
<p>That’s not the way it works, Drew.</p>
<p><strong>7:08:</strong> Roger Goodell, seemingly in the same outfit as the night before (who’s not going back-to-back these days?) mentions <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/24/nfl-draft-ratings-night-1-espn-2020-virtual-mike-tomlin-steelers/stories/202004240119" target="_blank">Thursday’s record TV rating</a> and says, “That’s a tribute to all of you and your passion for football.”</p>
<p>Actually, that’s tribute to the fact that SPORTS ARE GONE.</p>
<p>Having said that, I like Goodell way better in this minimalist environment. He’s more real. Some people think he looks ridiculous in his basement, but you know what really looks ridiculous? A 61-year-old man doing flying chest bumps with 22-year-old football players.</p>
<p><strong>7:10:</strong> The Bengals had an entire day to think about their pick, but they will apparently use their full time allotment.</p>
<p><strong>7:15:</strong> They take Tee Higgins, and for some reason we are suddenly watching a women’s basketball game (turns out Higgins’ mom played hoops).</p>
<p>Trey Wingo informs us that Wiggins has the fifth-longest arms of any receiver in the past eight years, or something.</p>
<p><strong>7:21:</strong> The Colts take Michael Pittman — a player linked to the Steelers.</p>
<p>But then, which player hasn’t been linked to the Steelers?</p>
<p><strong>7:34:</strong> The strangest moment of the draft — even stranger than the kid in the blue chicken suit at Mike Vrabel’s house — just happened: Bill Belichick turned into a dog.</p>
<p>Seriously, a husky is sitting in Belichick’s spot at the kitchen table. The only way this would be better is if the dog were wearing a hoodie with cut-off sleeves.</p>
<p>The Ringer’s Rodger Sherman tweets:</p>
<p>“THE PATRIOTS DYNASTY IS OVER</p>
<p>BRADY IS GONE</p>
<p>GRONK IS GONE</p>
<p>BELICHICK HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH A DOG”</p>
<p>How else to explain them taking a player from Lenoir-Rhyne? And of course we see him playing basketball. I didn’t see this many basketball highlights on the Michael Jordan documentary.</p>
<p><strong>7:46:</strong> Steelers-related tension building around running backs J.K. Dobbins, Jonathan Taylor and Cam Akers — all still on the board.</p>
<p><strong>7:48:</strong> The Texans take defensive tackle Ross Blacklock, and we are now watching basketball highlights again.</p>
<p>OK, wait, this is legit: His dad, Jimmy, played for the Harlem Globetrotters.</p>
<p><strong>7:48:</strong> The Colts trade up for Taylor at No. 41. Steelers eight picks away.</p>
<p><strong>7:55:</strong> Jags take receiver Leviska Shenault Jr.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/24/steelers-second-round-who-to-pick-nfl-draft-2020/stories/202004230158" target="_blank">He was linked to the Steelers</a>, too.</p>
<p><strong>8:02:</strong> Did Wingo just say the Bears now have 10 tight ends on their roster?</p>
<p><strong>8:09:</strong> There’s Bruce Arians on his back porch. The Steelers once were linked to him.</p>
<p>This is beginning to feel anticlimactic. The Steelers are going to take Dobbins or Akers, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>8:11:</strong> Broncos go with KJ Hamler (linked to you-know-who) and now have so many weapons that Drew Lock could play terribly and still be good.</p>
<p><strong>8:18:</strong> Atlanta and Seattle choose defensive linemen at Nos. 47 and 48. The Steelers waste no time. Their pick is in, and if Booger McFarland ever stops talking, we’ll see it.</p>
<p><strong>8:25:</strong> Back from break, we get a shot of quarterback Jalen Hurts, who has been linked to … oh, never mind. GM Kevin Colbert appears to be sitting in a furniture store.</p>
<p>With the 49th pick, the Steelers take … <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/24/steelers-2020-nfl-draft-picks-round-2-3-chase-claypool/stories/202004240125" target="_blank">Chase Claypool</a>? Of course, the one man in the entire draft who has not been linked to them.</p>
<p>We are suddenly inundated with breathless reviews of the 6-foot-4 Claypool, including Chris Simms saying he’s the best athlete he’s ever seen and ESPN saying he’s the “second fastest receiver ever at 230-plus pounds,” running the 40 in 4.42 seconds. Only Calvin Johnson was faster.</p>
<p>All of which raises a question: Why’d he last until the 49th pick?</p>
<p>We are now watching Claypool’s high school highlights, and he is so much bigger than his opponents that he looks like Andy Reid in the punt-pass-and-kick competition.</p>
<p>“Bruh who was he playing against in high school,” tweets ESPN’s Ryan Clark.</p>

<p>Listen, the Steelers are to be trusted on wide receivers. They draft them better than anyone, and this kid has enticing talent. But I would have gone for Dobbins.</p>
<p>James Conner might be one-and-done here and has trouble staying on the field. Maybe the Steelers are more confident in Benny Snell Football than we think. Maybe they’re in on Leonard Fournette. Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>8:38:</strong> There goes Akers, to the Rams.</p>
<p><strong>8:40:</strong> There goes Hurts … to the Eagles?</p>
<p>Everyone seems thrilled, except Hurts. Perhaps because he’s thinking, “I just went to a team that has a 27-year-old quarterback with a $128 million contract.”</p>
<p><strong>8:54:</strong> The Ravens, of all teams, take Dobbins. They were already the best running team in NFL history.</p>
<p>It’ll be mighty interesting to track his progress vs. Claypool’s.</p>
<p><strong>9:17:</strong> The Patriots take edge rusher Josh Uche. The Uche family has two interesting items in the background: a giant Marilyn Monroe picture and a now-maskless Drew Rosenhaus standing too close to people.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, we move ahead in our coverage …</p>
<p><strong>11:29:</strong> Goodell is now making picks from a grandpa-style easy chair. All he needs is a pipe. I’m telling you, this is making him likable.</p>
<p><strong>11:49:</strong> The Patriots trade into the 101st spot and choose tight end Dalton Keene, who looks like an Allman Brother.</p>
<p><strong>11:52:</strong> The Steelers at No. 102 opt for an edge rusher in Charlotte’s Alex Highsmith. Louis Riddick likes the pick, saying the Clemson linemen were very complimentary of Highsmith.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I knew Charlotte had a college football program.</p>
<p>But then, I didn’t know Lenoir-Rhyne had one, either.</p>
