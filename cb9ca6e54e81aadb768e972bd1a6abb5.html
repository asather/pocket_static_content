<h1>Pirates shut down offensively, lose to Cardinals again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ST. LOUIS — For Adam Wainwright, this sort of thing must be about as surprising as brushing his teeth or backing out of the driveway.</p>
<p>During a 14-plus-year career spent entirely in St. Louis, Wainwright has grown accustomed to frustrating the Pirates, his loopy curveball and lanky frame having beaten Pittsburgh a total of 19 times before Saturday — tied with the Brewers for his most against all MLB clubs.</p>
<p>And No. 20 came in familiar, fitting fashion, too, as the 38-year-old Wainwright gave his team six strong innings, the Pirates failed to get much of anything going offensively, and the Cardinals guaranteed an opening series win with a 9-1 victory at Busch Stadium.</p>
<p>Wainwright allowed one run on three hits over six innings, walking one and striking out five. He threw just 83 pitches (53 strikes) before relying on the Cardinals’ bullpen to finish the job.</p>
<p>The right-hander flipped over 24 curveballs, downshifting as low as 70.6 mph, but the Pirates managed to put just four of those in play. While it was only one game, they did not hit Wainwright hard at all.</p>
<p>“This guy's been pitching for a long time, and he's been able to execute pitches and change his stuff throughout his career,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “When he got into big spots, he made good pitches. That’s what guys who’ve pitched for as long as he has do.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh's only run came in the second, via John Ryan Murphy’s bases-loaded walk. Of the 18 outs Wainwright recorded, the ball left the infield on just four of them. The Cardinals legend retired 14 of the final 15 batters he faced, mixing his curveball with a terrific cutter and four-seam fastball.</p>
<p>In fact, the Pirates managed three hits the entire game, none after the fifth inning, and made just five outs on balls that reached the outfield. The Pirates got a runner to second base just once — in the second inning.</p>
<p>“These guys are going to hit,” Shelton insisted. “They’re going to have better at-bats. We just have to get our feet on the ground and get going.”</p>
<p>After hitting three home runs in a 5-4 victory Friday night, the Cardinals wasted little time getting back to work, as first baseman Paul Goldschmidt gave St. Louis a 1-0 lead in the first inning with a solo home run off the second deck in left field.</p>
<p>Trevor Williams was ahead in the count, but he missed with a four-seam fastball. Goldschmidt — who has 30 or more homers in five of the past seven seasons — pounced on it, the ball leaving his bat with an exit velocity of 104.1 mph.</p>
<p>“He made a bad 0-2 pitch to [Goldschmidt],” Shelton said. “Other than that, [Williams] did a pretty good job of executing pitches.”</p>
<p>That Williams missed with a four-seamer is notable because he saw the slugging percentage he allowed on that pitch jump from .338 in 2018 to .509 in 2019, when he gave up 27 home runs, including 14 on four-seamers.</p>
<p>Saturday’s outing was actually fairly diverse for Williams, however, as he threw 22 four-seamers, 21 sliders, 10 changeups, 10 curveballs, three sinkers and one cutter, according to BaseballSavant.com.</p>
<p>“It’s fun to have a new weapon in my repertoire, a weapon that I can trust,” Williams said of the curveball, which he intends to throw more this year. “We got the results with it that we wanted.”</p>
<p>Saturday was actually a reasonably close game until the seventh inning, when the Cardinals struck for four runs off Kyle Crick and tacked on two more in the eighth off Robbie Erlin.</p>
<p>The Crick trend is a little concerning, as he has yet to find his 2018 form; he failed to field a pair of comebackers, issued another walk and gave up back-to-back, two-run singles to Goldschmidt and shortstop Paul DeJong.</p>
<p>The bullpen remains a concern for the Pirates as they hand the ball to Mitch Keller for Game 3 of this series on Sunday. They also need to get more than one hit from the top four in their lineup.</p>
<p>But as far as failing to generate much off of Wainwright or Jack Flaherty on Friday, those guys are really good.</p>
<p>In Wainwright’s case, he’s been doing it a long time. And there’s a big part of Saturday’s loss that simply involves tipping your cap to someone who will eventually be feted with so many of the terrific players who’ve called St. Louis home.</p>
<p>“Wainwright out-pitched us,” Williams said. “He really did. He’s a Hall of Famer. He’s a guy that knows how to pitch, knows how to get into the sixth inning, and at the end of the day, they pitched better than us and it got ‘em that win.</p>
<p>“As far as pressure, if we’re putting too much pressure on ourselves, I don’t see it that way. I know that going into every game we’re ready and prepared to play to the best of our abilities.”</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>Dating back to last season, the Pirates have now lost 12 of their past 13 regular season games against the Cardinals. ... Cole Tucker made a sliding catch in right field to end the eighth inning. ... Chris Stratton and Nik Turley combined for 2 1/3 innings of scoreless relief.</p>
