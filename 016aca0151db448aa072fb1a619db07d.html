<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 03.02.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Good afternoon, everybody. After an absolutely thrilling five days in Indianapolis for the combine I'm back in Pittsburgh. And of course I now know with 100 percent certainty which guys are going where in the NFL draft. Let's do this.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: what's the most important position to get in the upcoming draft? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'm still leaning TE, but with OL a close second. To me, good O-linemen can land on your team in any number of ways. High picks like David DeCastro, mid-to-late rounders and then of course you see all the success the Steelers have had with undrafted gems. But tight ends? Most of the good ones around the league are home-grown, and it seems like second/third round is the sweet spot (outside of George Kittle, of course).</p>
<p><strong>Nixie</strong>: Brian would you be happy with WR Hamler with first pick if available from what you’ve seen at combine? Even being small not great of course but playmaking ability.. I Like are you? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Possibly. He'd instantly be the fastest guy in this receiving corps, even though he didn't run the 40 at the combine because of a hammy. You could probably use him in a lot of different ways to boost this offense. But he sure is small at 5-8 and does he have enough speed to be the deep threat that James Washington might not pan out to be? We'll see what he does at Penn State's pro day. There are a LOT of wideouts in this class. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Also, with a KJ Hamler question, I'd be remiss not to link you to Gerry Dulac's story on him from the combine <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/psu/2020/02/27/kj-hamler-nfl-draft-prospects-penn-state-football-scouting-combine/stories/202002270158" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/psu/2020/02/27/kj-hamler-nfl-draft...</a></p>
<p><strong>GPT</strong>: The Steelers lack a dynamic threat on offense. Do you see them going for more of a speedster at TE or WR vs. a Zach Gentry/James Washington type? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think it certainly helps to bring in different skill sets. At WR, to me, that's either a guy with legit take-the-top-off speed or maybe a bigger target, like a 6-3 or 6-4 jump ball specialist. As for TE, it'd be ideal to get an all-around type, a pass-catcher but also competent blocker. But that's what everyone wants to find, right? I really have no idea what to expect out of Zach Gentry going forward, or even what he might morph into at the NFL level.</p>
<p><strong>Tomlin's Heroes</strong>: Hey Brian - what is your opinion on what Brady may do this year. Stay in New England or take a ton of money somewhere else? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The scuttlebutt keeps pointing more and more toward him leaving, but I don't know, I'm just in "believe it when I see it" mode as far as Tom Brady in a jersey other than the Patriots. So, I'm sticking with NE as my prediction despite all the speculation otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Thanks for the chats as always Brian...I know its early but do you have any idea when the Steelers may find out if in fact they are for sure the choice for HBO's HardKnocks or another team was chosen? Thanks in advance and keep up the awesome job! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No problem, sean. Last year, the Raiders weren't officially announced until June. The year before, the Browns season was finalized in May. So probably sometime late spring/early summer. Have to imagine the Steelers will hem and haw as long as possible to try to wiggle out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Artie Bridge</strong>: I read those eye-popping numbers from Chase Claypool's scouting combine. 1) Does he fit with Steelers needs? and 2) Is he likely to be available when we pick? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, the big wideout from Notre Dame was a big winner last week. Measured in at 6-4, weighed 238, and ran a 4.42 40 at that size. Also jumped 40.5 inches. Pretty crazy. I do think he fits as a big target who's technically a wideout but has the body of some TEs. Anyone who provides something this offense doesn't have is a fit. And with how loaded this WR class is, I'd say there's a good chance he'll be there at 49 overall.</p>
<p><strong>Steelers2020</strong>: The NFL Draft has concluded, if you were to select a WR in the 2nd Rd, who wood you select? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: With no restrictions, sign me up for Henry Ruggs from Alabama. But he won't be there. Chase Claypool from the previous question is an interesting name/riser. But Ray Fittipaldo just posted his second mock draft, the post-combine version, earlier today and he has a different receiver going to the Steelers at No. 49. A flat-out speedster ... if he's still there in the mid-second: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/02/pittsburgh-steelers-2020-nfl-mock-draft-jalen-reagor-anfernee-jennings/stories/202002280120" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/02/pittsburgh-ste...</a></p>
<p><strong>VAsteelersFan</strong>: Hi BB . . . have you reached the point where you could answer questions re: BJ Finney re-signing with the Steelers in your sleep? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I dreamt about B.J. Finney last night</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Thanks for the chats. The NFLPA need not wonder why they have the worst deal in all 4 major sports. Pounceys rant as well as many others has to give leverage to the owners. You think they would figure that out. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not sure the rants have an effect on it one way or the other. The rank and file guys comprise the majority of the union, and they're the ones who stand the most to gain by this new CBA. In the end I think their votes will get the job done for the league. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The owners, I should say</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Must be a BPA at 49 regardless position right? Other than QB and TE which will Not be BPA, if a defense great player is there take it other than CB maybe.. your thoughts Brian <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That's pretty much what I'm thinking, Mike, except it would be almost too cute to not add to what was such a brutal offense last year. There are few glaring holes, at least right now, but also so many areas the Steelers can upgrade on that side of the ball. I wouldn't necessarily jump to the conclusion that a TE won't be the best guy available at 49. Depends how the first round and first half of the second shakes out.</p>
<p><strong>Picksixlisberger</strong>: Brian, Assuming Dupree signs Franchise Tag, what is the most glaring need <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: On defense, it's probably the defensive line. The interior, specifically, assuming Javon Hargrave is a goner. But you could also argue that grabbing a developmental edge-rusher to groom BEHIND Bud Dupree is a need. And Kevin Colbert said a couple times that the Steelers like the edge-rushing group in this draft. And, depending on what happens with Mark Barron and/or Vince Williams at inside linebacker, perhaps you want to find another every-down guy there to stick next to Devin Bush. Also, depth-wise, safety might be a spot you want to add to for 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: With the limited time players can practice with pads, isn't this a fair tradeoff for a 17th game ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Eh, not really. Padded practice time has already been decreased over the years. Plus, games take much more of a toll on a player's body anyway. Don't think there really is a fair tradeoff other than more money, and as you can see, even that isn't sitting well with a lot of the higher-paid veteran guys.</p>
<p><strong>AA</strong>: Why is it that many Steelers fans think they should cut Tuitt and resign Hargrave? First if all, I think they would have too much of a dead money hit for cutting Tuitt. Also it seems to me if Hargrave were better, he would have been playing instead of Tuitt when both were healthy. Am I wrong? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Can't say I've seen "many" Steelers fans saying that. Every once in a while we'll get that question or something along those lines in the chat. But the "why" is because of Stephon Tuitt's injury history, for the most part. Javon Hargrave has been extremely durable, on the other hand. But no, I don't disagree with your overall point and I'm not one who advocates for cutting Tuitt, in favor of Hargrave or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Tomlin is God, or god-like</strong>: Have the Steelers ever had a player with the oh-so-sweet first name of Clyde? Is this not reason enough to draft in Rd. 2 that Darren Sproles-ish RB from LSU? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Clyde is a pretty sweet name, indeed. But what about Flozell? And Cortez? And Bubby? Even on the current roster, you've got Tuzar and Ulysees. In this draft, Clyde also has stiff competition from Prince Tega Wanogho and BoPete Keyes.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: When do you think Cam Heyward contract extension will get done? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The only real deadline is before the season begins. But they wrapped up Maurkice Pouncey and Ramon Foster's extensions last March. Ben Roethlisberger in April. And then Joe Haden not until early September. So, your window is basically "any day now" until Week 1.</p>
<p><strong>rman</strong>: Hi Brian. What day is the draft? I'm not one of the folks that enjoys the lead up and speculation of the event. The Steeler' <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It's always nice to answer a straight factual question every once in a while for a change. The draft begins at 8 p.m. April 23 with the first round, then the second and third rounds on the 24th, and wraps up with the final four rounds on the 25th. The lead-up and speculation is what it's all about!</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Good afternoon Brian what prospects looked good at the combine for our second round pick <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hey Ryan, I went to quite a few interviews with players at the combine and believe it or not, they're all very versatile, smart and physical and can help any team. Granted, I've never covered it before, but this might be the best draft ever.</p>
<p><strong>CM</strong>: Do you agree with Kevin Colbert's assessment that a 38 year old QB who had elbow surgery and didn't play last year, could be better ? Or, is this the GM's (and/or pittsburgh sports writers) way of coping with the fact that Big Ben has the Steeler's organization over a barrel with his current contract. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I mean, his stated logic that he's basing that statement on is that Ben Roethlisberger's arm might've been bothering him prior to the injury without him really knowing or being fully aware of it. Not a doctor, but that seems plausible. To the second part of your prompt, no, you probably won't see the Steelers or any other team openly questioning giving huge money to an aging veteran. The money speaks for itself in terms of how much they believed in him at the time, and even if they're doubting that now, why say it publicly?</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Brian, I definitely agree with Ray that Steelers need speed at WR. As much as I like players like Hamler and Reagor, I'd like to see them draft someone like Mims or Justin Jefferson. Guys who are also tall. Hopefully, they would make a great red zone target, too, in addition to being a deep threat. What say you? Thanks! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah Nate, those two also had a really strong combine. Justin Jefferson from LSU is someone I don't expect to still be there at 49. Denzel Mims is more likely to drop, or at least he was, before running a 4.38 at 6-3. There's really just a lot to like about this receiving class.</p>
<p><strong>SteelCity21</strong>: Who are players that will be cut by Steelers? What savings doe that give them? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't have a crystal ball, my friend, but the most likely candidates - as they have been really since the season ended and we started discussing this a lot - remain Ramon Foster, Anthony Chickillo and Mark Barron. Mainly because they'd all save more than $4 million on the cap. Other guys who aren't as highly paid but just might not be in the plans for 2020 are probably Jordan Berry, Dan McCullers and, someone who's not being talked a lot, maybe Rosie Nix? He was hurt a lot last year and barely played even when he was healthy.</p>
<p><strong>FL Fan</strong>: Hi Brian, great chat as always - as noted several places the Steelers are pretty top heavy in regards to contracts, when do you think some of the big money guys (Pouncey, Ben, Heyward) might start to age out via retirement or release? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well, Maurkice Pouncey has said before that when Ben goes, he goes. I don't think many people expect No. 7 to play beyond this current contract that has two years left. And Cam Heyward is still playing at a high level, but heading into his age 31 season, conventional wisdom would say this next deal will be his last long-term contract. Al Villanueva also turns 32 in September and is entering the final year of his deal.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Medium Chest</strong>: Hi Brian, its been awhile (completely my fault) I wouldn’t draft a TE high for the following reasons: Bens return makes Vance a more productive player, not a great TE class &amp; more pressing needs. What are your thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I might never forgive you. Anyway, it's no guarantee that Ben's return will turn Vance McDonald into his 2018 self. But yes, if the Steelers believe that season wasn't an anomaly, it will lessen their need to restock at that spot. Talk around the league is that the TE class this year is lacking, but hey, that could mean you get one of the better options at 49. IF you want to go that route. To an extent, it also depends on how much they think last year's fifth-rounder Zach Gentry can improve in Year 2.</p>
<p><strong>Country Guru</strong>: Hi Brian...do the Steelers have any chance of signing TE Austin Hooper? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He's probably the best (or at least most reliable) TE on the market, which means I just don't see how they'd be able to pay him what he's worth.</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Does it bother you to hear people say we must take a TE in rd 2, OL in rd 3, etc Then those same people complain that the Steelers reached for a need? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nothing bothers me about these chats. They're the highlight of my day and week, every week.</p>
<p><strong>Alan F</strong>: Who was the impressive prospect you saw in the combine who would look really good in Black &amp; Yellow? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Black and gold, Alan F, black and gold! I don't want you to get chewed out by the same fans who have yelled at me in the past. But anyway, speaking of black and gold or black and yellow or whatever, Geno Stone has already looked good in that color scheme. Basically the same darn jersey as the Steelers wear. He's also a Western PA guy, from New Castle. I wrote about him over the weekend and think he'd be an intriguing pick to slot in as the backup to Terrell Edmunds in the late rounds: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/28/geno-stone-nfl-combine-draft-prospects-malik-hooker-new-castle/stories/202002280150" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/28/geno-stone-nfl...</a> <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well would ya look at that, we're all out of time.
