<h1>Whether it's offense or defense, life as an outfielder fitting Pirates' Cole Tucker like a glove</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cole Tucker admitted that he has a problem.</p>
<p>Not a bad one, mind you.</p>
<p>But the Pirates infielder-turned-outfielder revealed Saturday that he has a substantial collection of baseball gloves at his house. One is signed by Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith. Another belonged to Adam Jones. Tucker has even picked a few up from current and former teammates.</p>
<p>Tucker doesn’t use any of them in games, but it has amounted to quite the collection for Cole and his father, Jackie.</p>
<p>“I have a problem, that’s for sure,” Tucker said, laughing. “Worse things to be addicted to.”</p>
<p>The glove Tucker is currently using has a neat story associated with it, too.</p>
<p>Whenever the Pirates decided to try Tucker in the outfield, one of the only game-ready gloves they had available was a Rawlings model that belonged to manager Derek Shelton.</p>
<p>Twins center field Byron Buxton actually gave it to Shelton last year as a gift. It has “Shooter” — Shelton’s nickname — inscribed on the side, along with a label for the Platinum Glove (highest fielding percentage) that Buxton won with Minnesota in 2017.</p>
<p>Tucker has since ordered a few of his own gloves, but they’ve not yet arrived. In the meantime, he’s happy with the rentals.</p>
<p>“When we played the Twins, I was like, ‘Yo, Bux, I got your glove!’ ” Tucker said. “He said, ‘I saw that. I love it.’ So, it’s cool to have his blessing to use his platinum glove.</p>
<p>“I’m a glove guy. I love gloves. Me and my dad have been collecting gloves forever. We probably have 100 baseball gloves at my parents’ house back home.”</p>
<p>Tucker may also have a new position, although he said he hasn’t given up on the infield portion of his work life. On games where he doesn’t start in the outfield, Tucker still takes ground balls in the infield.</p>
<p>But he’s also fallen hard for this outfield thing, learning the nuance of the position and also taking charge more frequently. On one ball Friday night, Tucker called off Bryan Reynolds, which is actually what he was supposed to do.</p>
<p>“When I caught it and threw it in, I thought to myself, ‘Did I just call him off on a ball he could’ve easily caught?’ But it was just second nature and kind of happened.</p>
<p>“I’m just trying to be aggressive out there and let my athleticism play. There’s a lot of space out there, so I’m just trying to be rangy and fast and make plays in the gaps.”</p>
<p>Tucker has certainly improved with his outfield work, but he’s nudging his way more and more into the lineup because of how well he’s hit. Entering Saturday’s game, Tucker was 6-for-12 in his past four games with an at-bat, raising his batting average to .256.</p>
<p>While Jarrod Dyson has struggled, the most productive use of time seems to be to play Tucker and let him gain valuable experience, especially if he’s going to produce offensively.</p>
<p>A big thing for Tucker has been similar to other Pirates who have struggled: timing and syncing up to the fastball. Tucker said he’s been more aggressive early in counts, thinking he might get something hard, and he hasn’t been thinking about his mechanics.</p>
<p>“All the stuff I worked on in the offseason and in spring training is just who I am now,” Tucker said. “That’s not saying I’m going to be 6-for-12 or hit .500 forever. But I feel like I have a baseline with mechanics and approach that that will play for me as long as I’m on time and swinging at stuff.”</p>
<p>So Tucker has an approach and a position, maybe even a starting one. Soon, he’ll even have his own glove.</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>• The Pirates said that closer Keone Kela, who left Friday’s game five pitches into his outing with right forearm tightness, was re-examined on Saturday.</p>
<p>He’s day-to-day, and they’ll re-examine his throwing status early next week.</p>
<p>• As for Kyle Crick, who threw live batting practice Friday, Shelton said he had not yet talked to Crick about any sort of next steps.</p>
<p>• Kevin Newman saw his nine-game hitting streak end on Friday, as he went 0-for-4 with a strikeout. As a result, he got a well-earned day off.</p>
<p>Shelton explained that he wasn’t about to mess with Newman’s streak.</p>
<p>“Being a former hitting coach, I have kind of a thought process that you don’t mess with that,” Shelton said. “He’ll be back out there [Sunday].”</p>
