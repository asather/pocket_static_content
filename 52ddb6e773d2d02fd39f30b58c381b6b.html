<h1>NYSE to begin process of delisting GNC shares</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange has notified Pittsburgh-based GNC Holdings, Inc. that it will begin the process of delisting the health and wellness retailer’s common stock from its exchange.</p>
<p>In a filing Tuesday, GNC said the NYSE told the company it is no longer suitable for listing now that it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Stock exchange officials had earlier warned GNC of a possible delisting based on its average share price falling below $1 as well as insufficient capitalization.</p>
<p>GNC officials said in Tuesday’s filing that they do not intend to appeal the delisting and that it expects trading of its stock “will transition to the OTC [over-the-counter] Bulletin Board or “pink sheets” market shortly.</p>
