<h1>Gene Therapy / Update: Lawn mowers still lethal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Accidentally or not, this column has begun to build something of a reputation for public service in difficult times, if we do say so ourselves.</p>
<p>For example, one recent installment, headlined, “Things to worry about while worrying that you’re worrying too much,” drew 24 comments, some of which may have been highly appreciative.</p>
<p>I don’t read the comments, so I can’t say for sure, but when someone explains that you needn’t worry about COVID-19 in every waking hour when there are killer hurricanes and wildfires and murder hornets about – to say nothing of galloping fascism – it’s only logical that such information is comforting.</p>
<p>In its way.</p>
<p>That’s why I am channeling some more “good news” for your holiday weekend, and again, no need to thank me:</p>
<p>Your lawn mower can kill you.</p>
<p>You probably haven’t thought about that in a while, but mowers like yours slay about 90 Americans per year, more than sharks, snakes, bears, and alligators combined, but not as many as deer, who take out about 200 of us annually.</p>
<p>One might think there’s enough accounting to do these days at Johns Hopkins University, busy with its highly reliable statistics on coronavirus, but apparently the esteemed academic institution still manages to maintain a busy garden department.</p>
<p>“Despite consumer education programs and warning labels, lawn mower injuries in the United States remain a serious public health concern,” is a quote that flowed into my email recently from Dr. Deborah Schwengel, assistant professor of anesthesiology and critical care at Hopkins’ School of Medicine.</p>
<p>I guess to be clear, Dr. Schwengel was talking about a study done two years ago, but while lawn mower swashbuckling has likely increased during the Hunker Games, the good news is that even though the average lawn mower injury requires surgery and about $37,000 in hospital bills, all of your other garden equipment is way more dangerous.</p>
<p>According to one analysis from data herded by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (the USCPSCNEISS), almost three quarters of lawn and garden injuries are caused by things other than your mower. I’m talking about internecine contraptions like your blowers, chainsaws, pruners, portable generators, power washers, weed-whackers and hedge trimmers.</p>
<p>I’m fortunate in these areas because my late father, gone 10 years and bestower of many blessings, left me with a finely cultivated terror of sharp objects, particularly if they are plugged in or, worse, whirring and whirling at high speed and powered by flammable mixtures/potential explosives.</p>
<p>To him, only two things could happen to someone (me) at the controls of, say, a hedge trimmer. I could accidentally trim the cord and electrocute myself, or, in his very words, “You’ll cut your arm off with that thing.” This was a variation of his instructions once I became old enough to shave, in which, razor in hand, he explained that I should “be careful with this thing, or you’ll cut your head off!” That’s why, I figured, I was told to shave over the sink, to keep my severed head from bouncing out into the hall and down the steps. Mom was always saying, “If I see one more severed head come bounding down these steps . . . “</p>
<p>OK not always.</p>
<p>No wonder my enthusiasm for lawn mowers is virtually non-existent, similar to my interest in the lawn itself. That term, lawn, is a most charitable identifier for what I have, which is grass, another term that’s pretty charitable for this property. But even that which is charitably called grass has to be cut, and there’s a lot of it, which is why I happened to brush up on the lawn mowing safety tips and instructions recently, that and the fact that I was just informed I’m deep into the age bracket of America’s most endangered lawn mower operators – 60 to 70.</p>
<p>Tip No. 1 was that I should read the owner’s manual.</p>
<p>Unless John Grisham wrote it, probably a no.</p>
<p>Tip No. 2 went something like “take the time to do basic maintenance to ensure your equipment operates safely for the season and is ready to get the job done.”</p>
<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p>
<p>Tip No. 3 was about your surroundings: “Before you rev up, remove objects such as sticks, glass, metal, wire, and rocks from the area.”</p>
<p>Dude, if it weren’t for sticks, glass, metal, wire, rocks, roots, rabbit holes, and forgotten dog toys, I wouldn’t have a yard.</p>
<p>Tip No. 4 had to do with alcohol: “Drink plenty of water when working outside and save the beer for after all of your work is done for the day.”</p>
<p>I usually switch the order on that, then forget about the water.</p>
<p>Tip No. 5 (and I would have made this No. 1): Let someone else do your yard work.</p>
<p>Yes; I always knew that one day, there’d be a solution.</p>
