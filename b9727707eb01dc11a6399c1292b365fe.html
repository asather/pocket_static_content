<h1>How Oscar Marin is trying to improve the Pirates' pitching staff</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Oscar Marin has a seemingly tall task in front of him in 2020 and beyond.</p>
<p>The Pirates pitching staff finished 2019 with the fifth-worst team ERA in the league. If now-Rays pitcher Tyler Glasnow is to be believed, the last Pirates coaching staff lagged behind in terms of using analytics and the tools at Major League Baseball teams’ disposal to provide their pitches with all the information possible.</p>
<p>Marin, the Pirates’ first-year pitching coach, is in charge of fixing that and, ideally, any other issue facing the Pirates’ pitching staff.</p>
<p>To start, right-hander Jameson Taillon said Marin basically sat his pitchers down in spring training and gave them what Taillon called an “analytic seminar for dummies.”</p>
<p>“The hardest thing to understand with this stuff is understanding the numbers that they’re getting from sheets or information, whether it’s Trackman, whether it’s units that we have like a Rapsodo, things like that. So we simplified it for them,” Marin said. “And this came from when I was a coordinator, I had it simplified for myself when I first started learning it, and I dumbed it down for myself, which in turn made it a lot easier to teach people how to do it after I did it for myself. It started with the coaches and then from coaches transitioned onto the players.</p>
<p>“So it’s basically taking all that information and simplifying it so you’re able to understand and eliminating the noise on things that maybe they don’t have to see and going from there.”</p>
<p>From there it’s been different work with different pitchers. Perhaps Marin’s most hands-on case has been right-hander Trevor Williams. Both Marin and Williams spent the COVID-19 layoff in Phoenix, so they got to work together closely.</p>
<p>That meant working to perfect both of Williams’ breaking balls over a 12-week span, rather than tinkering with them game to game.</p>

<p>Left-hander Derek Holland, who signed a one-year deal with the Pirates this offseason, came to Pittsburgh in part because of Marin. He was a minor-league pitching coach in the Texas Rangers’ organization when Holland was a Ranger. At one point, Holland served a rehab assignment with Marin’s team, and Holland speaks fondly of the way Marin helped him build himself back up.</p>
<p>Holland, then, can speak first hand about the type of impact Marin can have as a pitching coach.</p>
<p>“It is, no joke, amazing how he can catch something so quickly when I’m out there throwing on the mound or whatever the case may be, to be able to find that adjustment, so quick that maybe I couldn’t find it as fast,” Holland said earlier this week.</p>
<p>Really, though, Holland says Marin’s plan with the Pirates has been different for every player. For now, that has mainly focused on ensuring that the pitchers were doing just enough to continue to improve over the break but not too much to threaten injuries.</p>
<p>Ideally, then, entering summer camp, the pitchers aren’t starting over, but are ready to pick up where they left off.</p>
<p>“We had a look at all of our guys individually and first making sure we communicated and talked about what they had around them,” Marin said. “So depending on whether they had a facility to go get physical therapy or they had a gym at home, something like that where they can get similar workloads off of just the throwing, that’s what we really had to keep in mind. So some guys who learn a little quicker than others, but that’s what we took in mind when we put these plans together.”</p>
<p>Marin’s time with the Pirates has not come without adversity. Entering his first year, he knew he would be without Taillon. He knew Chad Kuhl and Steven Brault were battling back from injuries. Just last month, his most tenured starter Chris Archer went down, having surgery for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome.</p>
<p>Obviously, Marin wishes none of those things had happened. He says, however, that while that is true, he and the Pirates simply have to move forward, working to maximize the pitchers they do have rather than worry about the ones they don’t.</p>
<p>The results have been positive so far, by all accounts. Asked simply if he was happy with hiring Marin, manager Derek Shelton laughed and emphatically said yes.</p>
<p>How things go on the field in 2020 and the years to come will ultimately define the success of Marin’s tenure.</p>
<p>“If you spend any time talking to any of our pitchers, the first thing they’re going to rave about is his ability to communicate,” Shelton said. “Because you can know all the other things, but if you can’t translate that into the players’ language — and each individual player’s language — then it doesn’t matter. The one thing about communication is if it’s not consistent and understandable, it’s chaos. And we don’t want chaos. We want consistent information that people understand and his ability to break it down for each guy.”</p>
