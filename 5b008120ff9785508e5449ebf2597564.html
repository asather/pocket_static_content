<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 05.20.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi folks. Welcome to my weekly Pirates chat. Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to ask your questions now. I'll be back at noon to answer them. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, kids. Let's do this.</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: in the best interest of management why doesn't the brass simply get rid or all the players they see that have potential, that way they can make more money with a lower payroll every year and that way the so called fans can watch players with no talent playing in the majors . stop having give away nights, that costs the owner money, stop fireworks, that cost money and then up the price of concessions, the fans don't seem to mind how management treats them anyway, remember, build it and they will come !!!!! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi paullochrane, please stop being so optimistic. There's no such place for that here. Seriously, if you have a legitimate questions, I'm happy to answer it. If you wanna complain about the Pirates being cheap, I don't know what to tell you. I'm pretty sure I don't make financial decisions for them.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Let’s see your 30 man roster. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Does it have to include Pirates players, or can it be, say, musicians? Pirates-wise, here goes nothing ... lineup (8): Newman, Reynolds, Frazier, Bell, Polanco, Moran, Dyson, Stallings ... starting pitchers (5): Archer, Keller, Musgrove, Williams, Holland ... bench (5): Osuna, Gonzalez, Riddle, Maile, Heredia. ... bullpen (8): Kela, Crick, Rodriguez, Burdi, Santana, Feliz, Stratton and Brault. ... extras (4): Holmes, Erlin, Hayes, Tucker.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Hello Jason. My deepest condolences to Starling Marte and his family. My thoughts and prayers are with them. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi James. Thank you for sharing. I agree. Just a terrible circumstance for Starling and everyone involved. Same on the deepest condolences.</p>
<p><strong>Too Tall 21</strong>: Jason, I hate the DH, but hey, better to play what I’d describe as exhibition games than not play at all! So, as far as the Bucs go this year, my ideal would be to keep Bell playing first base and DH Moran/Osuna/Craig/??. That way Hayes gets to play 3rd everyday and we find out if he’s gonna be good enough with the bat. What’s your best guess as to what Shelty will do? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Too Tall 21. Good question, although I don't think I would call these exhibition games. It's going to be rather intense if they do figure out a way to play. A couple things I think Shelton will do: 1. Rotate the spot. He said previously that they're not going to "David Ortiz or Travis Hafner it." ... 2. I like Moran there. I think you give Bell a chance to show he can be a better fielder. DH'ing Moran gives you a chance to play Hayes. ... 3. I wouldn't DH Craig. His best asset, at this point, is his glove. If you're going to do anything with him in the big leagues, you need to DH Bell and play Craig at first. ... 4. I would use Polanco there intermittently if his shoulder is bothering him. Director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk told us a couple months ago that this would be a recurring issue with Polanco. They need to do all they can to preserve his arm and body and keep him in the lineup.</p>
<p><strong>RC</strong>: Hey Jason, how was the idea of the National League playing with the designated hitter (If there is a season) instituted? Did this come from the Commissioner? Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey RC. I think it came from a couple different places. The commissioner is one, yes, but the teams, too. In a normal year, maybe they fight it. But with a quick ramp-up, the fact that pitchers didn't hit during the spring and needing to make games as entertaining as possible for a TV -- and not in-attendance -- audience, it only makes sense. I think it's probably here to stay, to.</p>
<p><strong>Too Tall 21</strong>: If/when Frazier gets traded, who becomes the second sacker in the near term? Would Newman move over and Tucker become the SS or does Tucker take over 2nd? Kevin Kramer is showing on the 40 man as an outfielder, so is he now out of the picture at 2nd? (I’m assuming Cruz is out of this discussion for another year or so). <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Another good one. And yes, I believe Frazier will be traded. Just a matter of when they find the right fit. And not that they don't like Frazier, either; more that if he has value, it makes sense to turn him into multiple prospects, the same as it would for other guys such as Archer or Keone Kela. I think Frazier encounters a little different scenario because of the Pirates actually having a few good, young middle infielders, guys like Newman, Tucker, Cruz and even Liover Peguero. ... As for who plays there, I think that's still TBD. It won't be Cruz, I can tell you that. Could be Newman or Tucker. I think both would be comfortable there. I don't know enough about Peguero.</p>
<p><strong>AlCal</strong>: What direction do you sense that the Pirates will go in the upcoming draft, C/position of need or best available ... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi AlCal. I've spent a decent amount of time thinking about this lately. Probably, like most things baseball-related, too much. But I think they're gonna go best player available. Taking Patrick Bailey is a bit of a reach. It's prioritizing need over BPA. If I'm Cherington, I take someone else -- maybe the lefty Detmers or Heston Kjerstad, the power-hitting corner outfielder -- and try to snag a catcher with my comp pick. But they do need to get catching in some shape or form here.</p>
<p><strong>Cheryl</strong>: Do you think the Pirates have a better chance to keep Josh Bell if the National League adopts the designated hitter permanently? Could Nutting be willing to spend more money to after high level free agents? Thx Jason! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Cheryl. Honestly, I don't know how much having the DH impacts Bell's future here. Might be not at all. I think the bigger question is 1. What Bell wants followed by 2. Is Nutting willing to spend on a quote-unquote franchise player. They got McCutchen because he took a sizable discount. With Boras representing him, I have a tough time seeing Bell do likewise. But on the other hand, I think Bell really does like it here, and I think -- no, I know -- that Boras really likes Cherington and (in a huge upset) Nutting. I do think talks will advance past where they are now. Speaking of which, here's the last thing I wrote on that. Might help: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/29/josh-bell-contract-pirates-mlb-coronavirus-pandemic/stories/202004290051" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/29/josh-bell-contr...</a></p>
<p><strong>Too Tall 21</strong>: Non-baseball question — Been binge-listening the Dead for the last 2 months. Would you chose the Barton Hall/Cornell show in May ‘77 or the Closing of Winterland, New Year’s Eve ‘78 if you had only those 2 choices? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Bless you. Love the non-baseball questions. Seriously. ... This might be an unpopular opinion among Deadheads: I would take the Winterland Show. Bill Graham serving breakfast in the morning! I know Cornell is special, and I'm not saying it stinks or anything like that. But I'm equally as impressed -- and maybe more so -- with the other shows on the Get Shown The Light box set, especially the next night in Buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri</strong>: With there only being 5 draft rounds, will that cause the Pirates to consider making more trades and put more money into free agents? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Yuri. I don't know about make more trades -- they can only make so many because of what they have -- but I do think it will increase the importance of maybe finding some undrafted free agents, which has actually been a strength throughout Ben Cherington's career. A big area for that might be internationally, as the current bonus structure -- just $20,000 -- for domestic, undrafted guys stinks.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: The pirates should sign Yasiel puig and have him play RF or DH to give polanco some time off <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You know, I get this question/suggestion every week. I normally don't agree with its premise. If the Pirates aren't going to compete for a division title (I don't think they will), then what's the point in signing someone like Puig? Just save the money and use it whenever you are going to compete. However, I don't know if it's a shortened season or what, but my feelings are softening there. I still worry about the personality fit.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: Who do you see being the pirates breakout player for 2020? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think all the signs are there for Mitch Keller to take a huge step forward. He looked excellent during spring. He also had the stuff. I think he's finally developing the attitude and temperament to go with it. I also think this new regime has a much better idea on how to develop him than the old group did with their young pitchers. They're letting him be a power pitcher, a strikeout guy who relies a lot on spin stuff. The other group would've made him pound sinkers down in the zone.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: I think polanco is going to have a big season. Do you agree? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: If he stays healthy, I agree with it. We're not the only ones, either. One of the scouts I respect the most in this game said the same exact thing a couple weeks ago: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/27/pittsburgh-pirates-2020-season-colin-moran-gregory-polanco/stories/202004270012" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/27/pittsburgh-pira...</a> <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: But again, he has to stay healthy. I don't think any of us have a guarantee that will happen.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: a lot of the buzz seems to be college bats for pirates. Do you think that’s the direction they go? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I'm not sure. I think it makes sense for them to go that route. I also think that's an easy line to draw because they're picking No. 7 and there are several very good college bats available there. But I also know you can never have enough pitching, and last year they had very little high-end pitching talent. It's better now but still could use some work. They also have no legitimate catching prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Walt</strong>: Hi Jason... I also want to extend my sympathy to Starling Marte and the Marte family. I would like to know if you have visited the Roberto Clemente museum. I highly recommend it. Do you think Roberto’s number will ever be retired? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Walt. I have visited the Clemente Museum. It's incredible. My first time -- shame on me; it shouldn't have taken this long -- was this past Clemente Day. I was blown away. ... Yes, I think they will retire it. I think it should be retired now. But his legacy is so big, so cool. Very similar to Jackie Robinson. They need to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Wyan</strong>: Any progress in these meeting between the players and the owners? Are you more confident this week or last week doing this chat about a season happening? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Here's what I know. I wouldn't necessarily describe it as progress, but it should describe where things stand. One, medical/health/safety is a much easier hurdle to clear than the financial, if you can believe it. Or at least that's what is believed at this point. Both sides feel like there's some common ground, and there's support within individual states to get something off the ground in terms of safe ways to play. The bigger issue, then, is money. That's not good right now. The players think they've negotiated their salaries for the 2020 season -- prorated and paid according to how many games are played. Owners aren't gonna do that. They're introducing a 50-50 revenue sharing plan that the players, whether they're right or wrong, think equates to a salary cap. Then yesterday it comes out that the owners basically said negotiate a new deal or wait until the whole thing is over, implying that nothing has been decided. I don't have a lot of faith the owners are going to propose some sort of super ... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: player-friendly deal here, and suddenly there's not going to be an impasse. I think it's an intense game of chicken, and neither side is showing signs of budging. And that stinks.</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: I agree mostly with your 30 man "player" roster. I have been reading that a lot of teams are considering a 3rd catcher. An option versus 3rd leftie? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Could be. But I have a tough time seeing position players taking up three of the four extra spots, and I think they want to get Hayes and Tucker involved. Plus, Brault was hurt and might wind up functioning more as a starter. One thing we should think about -- and I might include Chad Kuhl over Clay Holmes for this reason now that I think about it more -- is starting pitching. Guys won't be built up. You may look to go 3 + 3 to get through 6 innings for awhile, thus the need for Brault, Kuhl, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: Could the Pirates draft Bailey as an underslot guy and use the saved money with picks 31 and/or 44? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yeah, they probably could. But you can bet he has projections on where he'll go and will want around that slot $$$, if not more. So, OK, you repurpose those dollars but you've also sort of reached for a guy. To make that move, you better be confident that money is necessary with the next two picks, and I think that's hard to predict. (That said, lemme contradict myself here for a second and say that I really like Bailey and having a catcher of the future they can start developing.)</p>
<p><strong>Bruce</strong>: Jason I think we have to face facts there won't be a season this year. Agree? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't Bruce. While I certainly have questions, I see no sense in just blindly packing it in right now. I love baseball. I miss it. I wanna watch more of it and write about it. I still think they can figure this out. They should be able to figure this out.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen P.</strong>: I watched the Last Dance on ESPN focusing on Michael Jordan. Who would you choose to be the focus of a similar Pirates documentary? Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: What a question. Does it have to be a current Pirate? ... I guess we're assuming that person has to be alive since Jordan was. And let's say ex-player, too. ... Maybe Steve Blass? I don't know if I could see Blass doing it. ... They should do one on Bob Nutting, honestly. That would be fun.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson</strong>: I literally am listening to your hit from yesterday with Cook and Joe. You said you know of no players with pre-existing conditions--has Taillon made it known if he would play if able, considering he would certainly fall under that umbrella, no? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Taillon is out for the year. He's not coming back under this scenario. I think he would want to later in the year when his TJ rehab is done, but they're saying it's not smart for his long-term health. So, he's begrudgingly waiting until 2021. Thank you for listening!</p>
<p><strong>Bracus</strong>: So Jason can I please ask you something? Why do you and other sports media guys keep giving the Pirates a pass regarding payroll? And act like you believe that Nutting THIS TIME will spend when necessary? I mean why on earth didn't he do it to build on a 98 win team after the 2015 season? Now it came out we have the lowest payroll in all of mlb in like 6 years! It's disgraceful sir and I'm tired of you and others acting like because the owner brought in a different mgmt team he is trusted to spend money down the road. It's ridiculous. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Um, excuse me, Bracus. I'd love for you to show me where I wrote or said that it's acceptable for Bob Nutting to be spending what he is. Answer: I haven't. He and they should be spending more. They also screwed up how they built upon the 2015 team -- essentially, they didn't. And I believe they understand that mistake and will do things differently next time. I don't see how it's being a shill for them by pointing that out. Where I come down on Nutting and Co. now is this: I understanding not spending $100 million now because of where you are in the cycle, but I do think they should at least be spending, I don't know, $75 million? $85 million? Something, anything more than they are.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmie</strong>: The realization that restored my perspective on the Pirates is this: if we stop supporting the team completely, the owners will eventually have to leave and Pittsburgh will become a AAA city like Indianapolis, Nashville, Buffalo, etc. So we have to accept the fact that we are a small market city, but we are at least in the Big Leagues. That means that at least we can support the GM as he builds a team from within. All those fans in AAA cities don't get to do that! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: That's a fair point, Jimmie. And it's OK to embrace that. You can win and do OK as a small-market team, but the Pirates have been a bad small-market team the past couple of years. They haven't brought in enough talent. They've let too much of it get away. They're developed pitchers poorly at the major league level. And they didn't have the back-fill ready when they lost players after 2015. They've made bad trades. All of that is potential improvement without spending a single dollar. ... And I get being mad at Nutting. I get being mad at the Pirates. I don't get just continually complaining about the same things over and over and acting almost incredulous when they don't change. Again, not endorsing it. Not saying you shouldn't be mad. But if I walk into Giant Eagle every day and scream that they charge too much for coffee, it doesn't mean they're going to put it on sale.</p>
<p><strong>Tammy</strong>: Jason, Dave Parker would be a good choice for the Last Dance question. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: He would, Tammy. You're right. I left him off, though -- and I should have explained this -- before I feel like he already had a really cool documentary made of his career. Would highly recommend it. "The Cobra at Midnight."</p>
<p><strong>Jackson</strong>: Sorry, I was more meaning has Taillon mentioned if he would feel safe playing considering he's a cancer survivor? I know he's out for the year. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I gotcha. Taillon would have zero issue, trust me. He would play on the moon right now if someone let him.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: Sign me up for a Dock Ellis “Dockumentary” !! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Very good point. Gotta have the biggest star alive, though.</p>
<p><strong>Too Tall 21</strong>: The Winterland show gets my vote, too! When Graham says to the crowd that morning, “Stay as long as you like”, that’s just unreal. Would never happen in this day and age! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Never, ever. That's one of the many things I love about the Dead. Pretty much everything that happened with them would never happen today. I'm only 36, but I fantasize often about what it would be like to live back then, in that culture.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard</strong>: Jason does it concern you that because of the pandemic and chances that a season won't happen, that Bob Nutting will use that as an excuse to keep the payroll really low a lot longer than the fans want. To me as a Pirates fan that is the most worrisome part. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Umm ... I have concerns, yeah, but maybe not directly what you're asking about. I worry about the whole business. People are complaining about Nutting being cheap, but nobody has pointed out how long he has held the line on employees. Angels, Rays, Marlins and I believe a few others have furloughed people. Pirates have not. Penguins have furloughed people. Pirates have not. Should Nutting spend more on major league players? I think so. But is he a reprehensible, repugnant human? No. He tends to take a cautious, conservative approach, and that's the part that concerns me. There will be a back-on-track period for the Pirates, and how long will that process take? Hopefully there are games soon, and that minimizes the damage on some really good people in the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Alicia</strong>: Hi Jason! So can you tell me if there is no vaccine developed yet into 2021 do we the fans have to worry about not being able to go to games for years? I can take this year without going but into next season and beyond would be terrible! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Alicia. I think that's a very real concern. And I wish I could tell you something that would make going to baseball games without a vaccine entirely safe, but we all know I can't. And I don't think MLB will try to have fans in the stands until a vaccine is readily available. I think we just need to cross our fingers and hope that we have one by then. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. Looks like that will do it for this week. Some great questions this week. Appreciate the participation. Until next Wednesday!</p>
