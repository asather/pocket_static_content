<h1>Local companies awarded Farmers to Families Food Box Program grants </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Several local companies and a nonprofit have been awarded millions of dollars in federal grants to box up the bounty from the region’s farms and give it to people in need due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday announced the first round of grants in what it calls the Farmers to Families Food Box program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April, as part of the the Coronavirus Farm Assistance Program, companies were invited to bid on their ability to put together and deliver to non-profit groups boxes of agricultural products — as a fresh fruit/fresh vegetable box, a dairy products box, a precooked meat (pork and chicken), fluid milk and/or a combination box of the above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Farm to Table Buy Local, which champions Western Pennsylvania food, won $281,880, which it will use with local farms, dairies and distributors to deliver the boxes to public housing residents, food banks and food pantries and other non-profits. The boxes will be like those people receive for their community supported agriculture, or CSA, subscriptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Farm to Table’s Erin Hart planned to hold a virtual meeting Monday with partner farms and one with the USDA on Tuesday. She says her group will distribute 100 to 500 boxes per week with partner producers including&nbsp;Clarion River Organics,&nbsp;Dillner Family Farm,&nbsp;Emerald Valley Artisans,&nbsp;Goat Rodeo Dairy,&nbsp;Harvie Farms,&nbsp;Triple B Farms,&nbsp;Turner Dairy,&nbsp;Twin Brook Dairy and&nbsp;Who Cooks for You Farm.</p>
<p>She said she’s “thrilled” to be part of this effort.&nbsp;“This is something that’s actually securing food.” She expects to start delivering boxes by next week.</p>
<p>Other Western Pennsylvania organizations participating in the Farmers to Families Food Box include: Marburger Farm Dairy in Evans City (granted $78,636), Monteverde’s Inc. in Thornburg ($1,440,000), Paragon Wholesale Foods in Marshall ($3,816,000), Schneider Dairy Inc. in Whitehall ($4,270,000) and Turner Dairy Farms in Penn Hills ($315,450).

<p>Ms. Hart says the food box program ensures that lack of transportation, financial distress and grocery store scarcity do not create a barrier to fresh food. Farm to Table has honed its door-to-door food delivery protocols with another program, funded by a $40,000 grant from the Heinz Endowments, to provide a meal from a local restaurant to all of the residents in the Allegheny County Housing Authority and the North Side YMCA. “By the end of this week, Farm to Table staff will have delivered more than 4,500 meals door-to-door to residents in 29 senior high-rise buildings and family communities,” says Ms. Hart, who notes that Farm to Table also has been helping 412 Food Rescue deliver to county housing sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She says the initial contract period with USDA is May 15 to June 30, but it can be extended in two-month increments for as long as through December. She says Farm to Table plans to&nbsp;start delivering 3,100 boxes per week now and expand to 3,900 boxes per week in July through October. If funded through the end of the year,&nbsp;the total contract for Farm to Table is $1,785,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this first round, the USDA approved $1.2 billion in contracts for the program. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a release, “We were pleased to see the abundance of interest from both food distributors and non-profit organizations.”</p>
<p>Through the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) may elect to extend the period of performance of the contracts, depending on program success and available remaining funds, up to $3 billion.</p>
