<h1>Joe Starkey: Totally baffled by baseball’s glorious, hideous return</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just to make sure it meant what I thought it meant, I looked up “cognitive dissonance” before sinking into my Pirates recliner Thursday night for the first game of what promises to be the strangest baseball season there ever was.</p>
<p>We were minutes away from Yankees-Nationals, and Major League Baseball still hadn’t revealed how many teams would qualify for the playoffs or where one of them (Blue Jays) would play “home” games.</p>
<p>And those were minor issues compared to this: One of the night’s headline participants, Juan Soto, tested positive for COVID-19 Thursday morning and was in quarantine. Soto was originally tested Tuesday morning, then played in a scrimmage against the Baltimore Orioles that night.</p>
<p>Sooooo …. shouldn’t anyone who came in close contact with Soto be quarantined, too? Teammates? Orioles? Umpires? And what about the possible danger of afflicted Nationals players taking the field Thursday without results of that day’s tests?</p>
<p>Should they even play the game?</p>
<p>That news hit around the time the Boston Red Sox shut down opening day starter Eduardo Rodriguez on account of COVID “complications.” Virus reports nationwide were mostly terrible.</p>
<p>And yet, I felt excitement at the prospect of tuning into a real, live baseball game after 266 days without one. Couldn’t wait to watch Max Scherzer match strikeouts with Gerrit Cole.</p>
<p>Conflicted as such, I went to the site simplypsychology.org, and this is what I found …</p>
<p>“Cognitive dissonance refers to a situation involving conflicting attitudes, beliefs or behaviors. This produces a feeling of mental discomfort leading to an alteration in one of the attitudes, beliefs or behaviors to reduce the discomfort and restore balance.”</p>
<p>I’m all about reducing discomfort. It’s one of my favorite hobbies. The money quote came next: “For example, when people smoke (behavior) and they know that smoking causes cancer (cognition), they are in a state of cognitive dissonance.”</p>
<p>Yes, and when people get psyched for a baseball game (behavior), and they know baseball in the middle of a deadly pandemic probably isn’t something to get psyched about (cognition), well, you know what state they’re in.</p>
<p>For better or worse, I took my cognitively dissonanced self to the man cave and grabbed the clicker.</p>
<p>This is how the night played out …</p>
<p><strong>6 p.m.</strong> My plan is to toggle between ESPN’s “SportsCenter” and MLB Network’s “MLB Tonight” in the hour leading to the game. “SportsCenter” of course begins with a shot of the American flag and the Baseball Hall of Fame and a sappy voiceover saying “at last the spirit of the game is in the air, and in our hearts.”</p>
<p>Please. The money-grubbing owners nearly killed the season. The players didn’t help. The two sides will be at each other’s throats again in no time, and the virus is raging because of our own ineptitude and denial. Just get to the game.</p>
<p>It looks as if MLB Network is following the same syrupy path, but Tom Verducci’s show-opening essay, as read by actor Jon Hamm, is actually phenomenal and speaks to why I’m drawn to this sport with such childlike enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“This is why we need you now,” Verducci says to baseball. “It is not because you heal us. You do not end wars, solve social injustice or invent vaccines. We need the nourishment of your routine, a ballgame on the car radio, the way a game unfolds like a good book. … You are our companion from childhood, and such friends have a special hold on us. As best friends do, we pick up a conversation as if 266 days had never passed. Welcome old friend. It’s so good to see you.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know I missed it so much.</p>
<p><strong>6:08:</strong> Nobody seems overly eager to address the Soto situation. MLB Network does a better job, though the report from Stephen Nelson is a bit confusing.</p>
<p>“The Nationals did say that in terms of contact tracing, they got word from Major League Baseball that they were all good (how so?), but the players that did come into close contact with Juan Soto will be further evaluated (how so?). That being said, the results of those (Thursday) tests will not be back in time for the game to be played tonight.”</p>
<p>So again, should the game be played tonight? The Washington Post reports some good news — that the Nationals gave Soto “multiple instant-result tests, both saliva and nasal, and the tests all came back negative.”</p>
<p>Maybe the first test was a false positive. Something tells me there will be many days like this.</p>
<p><strong>6:32:</strong> There is surreal and then there is flipping to ESPN and seeing Donald Trump and Mariano Rivera playing catch on the South Lawn, both dressed in blue suits.</p>
<p>Am I hallucinating?</p>
<p>Trump is fundamentally sound, using two hands to catch Rivera’s throws. It only gets weirder when Rivera launches into an interview.</p>
<p>“What does it mean to you, as the president of the United States, to have baseball back?” he asks.</p>
<p>Trump: “Well, especially at this time, when we have the COVID, and we have all of the things going on and we’re opening our country again …. it’s a spirit, it’s a time, it’s a special time.”</p>
<p>Isn’t it though?</p>
<p><strong>6:38:</strong> ESPN reporter Alden Gonzalez, live from Los Angeles, delivers the incredibly unsurprising news that Clayton Kershaw has been scratched on account of back stiffness. Gonzalez speaks from the stands behind home plate, in front of rows of cardboard cutout fans.</p>
<p>The jarring part here is how the cutouts are starting to seem normal. I like them.</p>
<p><strong>6:53:</strong> The Nationals raise their World Series banner. Morgan Freeman and several others appear on the scoreboard and deliver messages of social justice. The managers and select players are wearing masks as the teams line up. Both clubs take a knee before the national anthem but stand when the song begins.</p>
<p><strong>6:58:</strong> Dr. Anthony Fauci “throws” one of the five worst ceremonial first pitches in baseball history. It flies directly to his left and lands in the grass. Will Brinson of CBS tweets, “Fauci finally flattened the curve.”</p>
<p>Somewhere, Trump is snickering.</p>
<p><strong>7:09:</strong> Alex Rodriguez, working the ESPN broadcast with Matt Vasgersian, points out that baseballs are being replaced more often than usual.</p>
<p>“We might use more baseballs this season, in a 60-game season, than ever before,” he says.</p>
<p>I hadn’t thought of that, but he’s right.</p>
<p><strong>7:15:</strong> The public-address announcer is in excellent form. Fake crowd noise is piped in from the video game “MLB The Show.” The organist happily pecks away. Buster Olney is seated behind a chain-link fence in what appears to be the second deck.</p>
<p>Couldn’t they get him a better seat, since, you know, ALL OF THEM are available?</p>
<p><strong>7:16:</strong> Giancarlo Stanton just ruined a baseball. Couldn’t have hit it farther if Fauci had thrown it.</p>
<p><strong>7:17:</strong> A bald man with a three-ring binder is seen climbing the steps to retrieve the ball. Nobody seems to know who he is. Vasgersian labels him “The Wanderer.”</p>
<p>This is getting very weird.</p>
<p><strong>7:30:</strong> Adam Eaton homers off Cole and points to the stands as he rounds third. Who is he pointing to? Nobody’s there!</p>
<p><strong>7:44:</strong> I switch to a live NBA exhibition game on the NBA TV. Lakers-Mavericks. So bizarre. Players from both teams are three rows deep on the benches. Feels like an AAU game.</p>
<p><strong>8:01</strong>: Vasgersian: “There’s nobody in the ballpark, except for Buster Olney. But there are people on the edges, if you will.” The camera pans to the roof of a hotel, where there isn’t a ton of social distancing happening as people watch the game.</p>
<p>The game, however, has become normalized. Looks like baseball to me, and that is a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>8:22:</strong> Reports of approaching lightning force camera operators from their positions. “Even the weather’s going 2020 on us,” A-Rod says.</p>
<p><strong>8:43:</strong> First Pirates mention of the night, and of course it’s a graphic showing how Cole only reached his vast potential once he left here.</p>
<p>“He was good in Pittsburgh,” Vasgersian says. “But he wasn’t what he is now.”</p>
<p><strong>8:49:</strong> Commissioner Rob Manfred joins the broadcast, likely feeling lucky there aren’t fans in the stands to savage him.</p>
<p>“Commissioner Manfred,” A-Rod says, “I want to ask you about the leadership of having to direct the efforts, to put together all this protocol between the players and the clubs. Just a tremendous job.”</p>
<p>Is there a question in there?</p>
<p>It gets better.</p>
<p>Vasgersian: “So, eight teams from each league, best overall record in each league gets a first-round bye. Do I have that right?”</p>
<p>Manfred: “No.”</p>
<p><strong>8:55:</strong> A biblical rain is now falling on Nationals Park. Literally looks like Niagara Falls in parts of the stands. I am worried Olney will be swept away. Game delayed.</p>
<p><strong>9:20 or so (I’ve lost track):</strong> ESPN throws to Karl Ravech for the second game, and he unwittingly offers a quote that should be played whenever somebody wonders what baseball was like in the pandemic season of 2020.</p>
<p>“One of the all-time great ballparks,” Ravech says of Dodger Stadium. “Unfortunately, because of COVID-19, we will begin the season with nobody there. Although the Dodgers, unlike the Nationals, have cardboard cutouts of fans, and, in fact, cardboard cutouts of dogs.”</p>
<p>Thank you Karl.</p>
