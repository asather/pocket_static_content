<p>Three students and a staff member at four Pittsburgh Public Schools may have had indirect exposure to someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19, a school district spokeswoman said in a statement Friday morning.</p>
<p>PPS spokeswoman Ebony Pugh said families and staff at Pittsburgh&nbsp;Brashear High School, Pittsburgh Carrick High School, Pittsburgh Oliver Citywide&nbsp;Academy and Pittsburgh South Hills received a robocall Friday&nbsp;morning alerting them of the potential indirect exposure to the virus.&nbsp;The indirect exposure occurred prior to the&nbsp;closure of the district.</p>

<p>The potential exposure happened while students were completing a vocational education program off-site at a community organization. In addition, a staff&nbsp;member assigned to Pittsburgh Oliver Citywide Academy had contact with the students before the closure of schools, Ms. Pugh said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Grab and Go meal site at Pittsburgh&nbsp;Oliver Citywide Academy will discontinue as a result of the exposure. Today was the last day for the site.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Carrick has been cleaned since the exposure, and Pittsburgh&nbsp;Brashear and Pittsburgh South Hills are currently scheduled for deep cleaning, Ms. Pugh said.</p>
<p>The school district said it will continue using its robocalling system to keep families and staff informed.&nbsp;Families can submit a ticket through the district’s&nbsp;Let’s Talk system at www.pghschools.org/LetsTalk to update their telephone number to&nbsp;receive calls.&nbsp;</p>
