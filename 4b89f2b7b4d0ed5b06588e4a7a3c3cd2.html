<p>WASHINGTON — A House measure to spend an unprecedented $100 billion in <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/disconnected/" target="_blank">rural broadband development</a> will close the digital divide, solving gaps in access to education and health care exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The legislation, called the Accessible, Affordable Internet for All Act, was approved on Wednesday as part of a broader, $1.5 trillion infrastructure package drawn up by House Democrats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The infrastructure package, called the Moving Forward Act, was unveiled two weeks ago by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/06/22/Infrastructure-package-Conor-Lamb-Guy-Reschenthaler-Donald-Trump/stories/202006170089?cid=search" target="_blank">lawmakers in both parties expressed optimism</a> that 2020 could finally be the year to fix the country’s crumbling highways, rails and waterways.</p>
<p>Yet the package passed by a near-party-line vote of 233 to 188, with just three Republicans joining virtually all Democrats.</p>
<p>Republicans railed against the plan’s provisions that aim to fight climate change — the “far-left Green New Deal initiatives,” in the words of Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters. In a statement, Mr. Reschenthaler said he opposed provisions like $325 million for electric school buses and $100 billion for housing programs.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle, as chair of the congressional panel overseeing telecommunications issues, has made universal broadband a top priority — the pandemic, he said, has&nbsp;only increased the urgency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We think these things are important and have been neglected for too long,” said Mr. Doyle, a co-sponsor of the broadband bill who took to the House floor Tuesday to praise the measure.</p>
<p>“We think these are going to be economic drivers,” he added, in the interview.&nbsp;“This is another great way to get this economy jump-started again.”</p>
<p>The bill was introduced by the House Rural Broadband Task Force, a group of lawmakers led by Rep.&nbsp;James Clyburn, D-S.C.,&nbsp;with the goal of reaching the 18 million Americans who currently lack broadband access by 2025. It was endorsed by organizations including the Communication Workers of America, American Library Association and a variety of technology trade associations.</p>
<p>The bill includes $80 billion directly for the deployment of broadband infrastructure. It&nbsp;would also provide $5 billion to support remote learning for students without internet access and $1 billion in grants to state governments to encourage people to sign up for broadband when it’s available.</p>
<p>At a hearing held by Mr. Doyle’s panel in January, Joshua D. Edmonds, director of digital inclusion for the&nbsp;City of Detroit,&nbsp;showed wide disparities in broadband availability and broadband adoption.</p>
<p>In Mr. Doyle’s district, spanning Pittsburgh and the Mon Valley suburbs, broadband was available to 96% of households and yet only 52% had adopted it, according to data from the FCC and Microsoft.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to do a lot of things to close this homework gap,” Mr. Doyle said on Thursday. “I think we need to do a more aggressive approach to allow states to map out ways to increase adoption and give them the tools and resources to get out into the communities and help people.”</p>
<p>The bill requires internet service providers to include low-cost options for plans offered on new infrastructure. It provides low-income customers a $50 monthly voucher and directs the Federal Communications Commission to collect and publicize data on prices charged for broadband service throughout the country.</p>
<p>A new office within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration would oversee efficient use of the funds, the bill states.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle recognized the House infrastructure package will have to be reconciled with any version put forth in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans.</p>
<p>The Senate has yet to propose a dollar amount for infrastructure or broadband investment, but there&nbsp;were big spending gaps between the two chambers’ surface transportation bills: The House’s highway bill totaled nearly $500 billion, while a Senate bill under debate totals $287 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle said he felt an urgency to pass infrastructure legislation — and bills to aid the country’s ailing economy — before Congress’&nbsp;six-week August recess.</p>
<p>“We’ve laid out our markers, we’ve shown our hand, our cards are on the table,” he said.&nbsp;“We’re ready to sit down and have a negotiation.”</p>
