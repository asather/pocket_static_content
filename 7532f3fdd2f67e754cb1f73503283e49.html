<h1>Pirates prioritize upside with South Carolina pitcher Carmen Mlodzinski</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">With the 31st pick in the MLB draft, the Pirates selected South Carolina pitcher Carmen Mlodzinski.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Mlodzinski struggled to get going in his freshman year in 2018 and sat out most of 2019 with a broken foot, but he bounced back in a big way after that. In the Cape Cod League, he had a 2.15 ERA and 40 strikeouts through 29.1 innings.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">That performance led him to being a second-team preseason All-American for Baseball America and he didn’t disappoint, putting up a 2.84 ERA with 22 strikeouts in 25 1/3 innings in a shortened season with the Gamecocks.</span></p>
<p>Mlodzinski, a 21-year-old junior, stands at 6-foot-2, 230 pounds and throws hard, sitting in the mid-to-upper 90s with his fastball, possessing a strong slider as his out pitch and another breaking ball for good measure.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“We really liked the way, simply put, he can make the ball move,” said Joe DelliCarri, Pirates senior director of amateur scouting. “He throws different pitches. He’s worked on different pitches. He has a variety of different pitches that can move in different directions. I would say that’s first and foremost. He’s worked on a little bit of cutter as well as slider, curveball, makes the fastball move to both sides of the plate. So it’s simple for us. Competitor, strong, like the way he does it, and he can really make the ball move.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">By drafting Mlodzinski, the Pirates selected their second player of the night who helped themselves in the Cape Cod League. No. 7 overall pick, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/10/Pirates-New-Mexico-State-infielder-Nick-Gonzales-number-7-pick-MLB-draft/stories/202006100132" target="_blank">shortstop Nick Gonzales</a>, used the better competition in Cape Cod to show his numbers at New Mexico State weren’t a fluke. Mlodzinski used it to show his struggles with injuries and performance in his first couple of years at South Carolina were not indicative of his overall ability.</span></p>
<p>DelliCarri shared that Mlodzinski’s past, specifically battling back from injuries, has helped shaped a fiery competitiveness in the young pitcher, and the Pirates were drawn to that.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“He’s fierce,” DelliCarri said. “With fierce comes intensity. And at times you might want to share with him our understanding that that’s terrific, it’s going to serve you extremely well, and there’s times he’s shared with us that he’s learned to harness some of that. We definitely don’t want to take a lot of that away from him in how he has gone about it.”</span></p>
<p>The addition of Mlodzinski adds some more depth to a pretty good group of young arms, which includes last year’s first-round pick Quinn Priester.</p>
<p>Of course, Mlodzinski is two years older than Priester, so how quickly he can work his way up the organization may depend on his durability and how well he can develop his off-speed stuff to round out his arsenal.</p>
