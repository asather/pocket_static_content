<h1>Steelers tight end Eric Ebron's cap hit, salary will jump in 2021</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After meeting tight end Eric Ebron for the first time at a Christianity conference on marriage in January, Ben Roethlisberger liked him so much he politicked coach Mike Tomlin to sign him.</p>
<p>It is not known if Roethlisberger ultimately swayed the Steelers to sign Ebron, but his pitch apparently didn’t hurt. They signed the seventh-year pro to a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/02/eric-ebron-steelers-contract-tight-ends-nfl/stories/202004020163" target="_blank">two-year, $12 million contract</a> that includes a $5 million signing bonus.</p>
<p>Ebron’s deal was structured so it was salary-cap friendly in 2020 and allowed the Steelers to be in compliance with the cap limit of $198.2 million.</p>
<p>Ebron will receive $1 million in base salary and count only $3.5 million against the cap this season. But his numbers jump in 2021 when his base salary is $6 million and he will count $8.5 million against the cap.</p>
<p>The Steelers did not have to restructure any more player contracts to get under the cap, other than the five they had previously reworked — Roethlisberger, tight end Vance McDonald, cornerbacks Joe Haden and Steve Nelson and kicker Chris Boswell. Those moves allowed the Steelers to clear approximately $20 million in cap space for 2020.</p>
<p>General manager Kevin Colbert said the Steelers liked Ebron when he was coming out of North Carolina in 2014, but they knew they likely wouldn’t have a chance to draft him with the 15th overall pick. They were right. Ebron was selected with the 10th overall pick by the Detroit Lions.</p>
<p>But, after four seasons with the Lions and two with the Indianapolis Colts, Ebron became an unrestricted free agent after the 2019 season. On a conference call with reporters Thursday, he recalled seeing Roethlisberger’s name on a list of people attending the January conference put on by the NFL Players’ Association and hoped to meet him.</p>
<p>“I thought he’d be pretty cool to meet,” Ebron said. “He actually came up to me. I told him I was a free agent and didn’t know where I was headed. Maybe he pulled a string or two, who knows.”</p>
