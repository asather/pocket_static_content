<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two nursing homes in southwestern Pennsylvania confirmed Wednesday night that a resident tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Rochester Manor and Villa in Beaver County confirmed a resident tested positive and is now quarantined in a&nbsp;“secure, isolated unit.”</p>
<p>Southminster Place in Washington also confirmed Wednesday that a resident had tested positive. The home, a part of&nbsp;Presbyterian SeniorCare Network, announced on Saturday that an employee had tested positive.</p>
<p>The resident at Rochester Manor and Villa has been placed in a&nbsp;“re-opened personal care wing” that was prepared in anticipation of a case of COVID-19 in the home.</p>
<p>“We treasure every single one of our residents and have taken extra precautions since the outbreak to protect their welfare, safety, and health,” executive director Kristin Oeder wrote in a statement. “It’s critical for us to be transparent and let our community know what precautions we have been and are taking.</p>

<p>“We are actively monitoring all residents for signs and symptoms and coordinating closely with the Pennsylvania Department of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health departments.”</p>
<p>The resident at Southminster Place was one of 47 who were tested Monday for the virus; the other 46 of those came back negative. Eight of the home’s staff members who were in contact with the affected employee also tested negative.</p>
<p>“Since the start of this pandemic, we have been aggressive about implementing network-wide precautionary measures and restrictions in accordance with federal, state and local guidance,” Presbyterian SeniorCare’s senior director of clinical services Kristin Henderson wrote in a release. “And we have been constantly updating and adjusting our protocols and procedures as the guidance and learnings have continued to evolve.”</p>
<p>The nursing homes both said the measures they’ve taken to mitigate spread include following government protocols on mask usage and social distancing.</p>
