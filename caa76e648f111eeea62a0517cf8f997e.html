<h1>Three indicted in scheme that used fraudulent cell phone numbers to impersonate IRS agents</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three men are under indictment in Pittsburgh on wire fraud charges in connection with activating and programming cell phones for use by criminals impersonating IRS employees to harass unsuspecting citizens into paying purported tax debts nationwide.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury last month returned charges against Ronnell Taylor Jr., 37, of Jeannette; Barry Nealer, 40, of Pittsburgh; and Michael Galanis, 31, of Export.</p>
<p>The case was unsealed last week in U.S. District Court and announced Thursday by the U.S. attorney's office.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that Mr. Taylor, the reputed ringleader, and the others inserted SIM cards into pre-paid cell phones and programmed the numbers to automatically forward calls to voice over internet protocol phone numbers, which were then used by IRS impersonators to defraud people in several states.</p>
<p>From March 2016 through August 2017, the grand jury said, the IRS impersonators placed VoIP calls to victims using falsified caller ID to display the phone numbers programmed by Taylor and the others.</p>
<p>The grand jury said Mr. Taylor bought SIM cards on eBay and had them delivered to UPS Store mailboxes he leased in Monroeville, then taught the other two how to activate and program the numbers associated with the cards to forward to the VoIP numbers. He also paid the other two men for their work.</p>
<p>The phones were then used by impersonators to rip off people in California, Michigan, Georgia, Connecticut and North Carolina.</p>
<p>In the case of one California victim, for example, a cell phone number was activated on March 7, 2016, by a phone registered to a cell tower 1.3 miles from Mr. Taylor's home, the grand jury said. The next day, someone pretending to be an IRS employee called the victim, identified as C.B. in the indictment, using that same number. The impersonator told C.B. to wire money for an alleged tax debt, and C.B. sent $7,000.</p>
<p>The indictment lists several other similar scenarios involving victims in other states.</p>
<p>The three defendants appeared briefly in federal court last week and entered standard not guilty pleas.</p>
