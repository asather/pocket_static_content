<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Broadway has given in to the inevitable and will remain dark at least through Jan. 3.</p>
<p>This is the fourth time the Broadway League has announced a push back for reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic — first, it was to April 12, then June 7, and most recently, Sept. 6.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.broadway.com/buzz/199499/broadway-performance-suspension-extended-through-january-3/" target="_blank">According to Broadway.com</a>, productions will offer refunds and exchanges through Jan. 3, but no official return date has been announced.</p>
<p>Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, said in a statement, “We are determined to bring back the people who rely on this industry for their livelihood, and to welcome back all those who love this vital part of New York City, as soon as it is safe to do so.”</p>
<p>The league has been working with the actors and stagehands unions, among others, to find a way to safely reopen and restore an estimated 96,000 jobs, not to mention the restaurant and hotel businesses it helps to sustain.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, the next scheduled Broadway tour is “Hamilton,” due at the Benedum Center Jan. 5-Feb. 7, 2021.</p>
<p>Some shows, including Disney’s “Frozen,” have announced they will not return when Broadway opens again. “Hangmen” by Martin McDonagh has said it will not open in New York, while another London transfer, the pop musical “Six” that was about to open on Broadway when the pandemic hit, is starting a drive-in tour — in the UK.</p>
