<h1>What have the Penguins been up to in Phase 2? Here's a peek behind the curtain</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>During a normal summer, the average NHL player doesn’t leave his hockey skates tucked inside a musty equipment bag for more than two or three weeks.</p>
<p>When the season ends, he may head to the beach or, in the case of Sidney Crosby last summer, drive across Europe. But he soon eases back onto the ice by skating with a small group of peers or working with a specialized skills coach.</p>
<p>During July, summer leagues and high-level pickup games are played in hockey hotbeds. Most Penguins return to Pittsburgh in August for player-led skates at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex. Training camp is in September. When the regular season begins in early October, players are near peak condition.</p>
<p>Add it all up, and that’s at least three months on ice before the puck drops.</p>
<p>As we are reminded daily, this is not a normal summer. NHL players, after what for many has been the longest non-injury layoff in over a decade, may only get seven weeks to knock off rust and get their engines revving back up again. Oh, and their first game back? It’s Game 1 of a best-of-five playoff series.</p>
<p>This race to the Stanley Cup will be a unique physical challenge, and the team that best utilizes limited ice time now may be the one that goes the distance.</p>
<p>“After this extended [layoff], it just makes it that much more important to get back to being an athlete on skates and not trying to gain it all back during Week 1 or 2,” skills development coach Ty Hennes said. “It’s going to take a little bit of time. But if it’s done properly, our guys should be ready to perform.”</p>
<p>The process began last week, when the NHL <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/25/nhl-phase-2-guidelines-return-to-play-pittsburgh-penguins/stories/202005250064" target="_blank">gave players the green light to step back inside team facilities</a> for the first time since the season was suspended March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Phase 2 of its return-to-play plan allows groups of six players and one supervisor inside a facility at a time.</p>
<p>The workouts are not open to the public or media. Non-essential team employees aren’t yet allowed in the building. So the only glimpses into the voluntary skates at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex come via photos and snippets of video the Penguins provide to media outlets and share on social media.</p>
<p>In a phone interview this week, Hennes, who in 2013 <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/01/13/pittsburgh-penguins-ty-hennes-skills-development-coach/stories/202001130119" target="_blank">turned down a career as a sports chiropractor to get into coaching</a>, pulled back the curtain to give a peek at what the Penguins are up to and discussed the challenge at hand.</p>
<p>At least three groups of players have been cycling through the facility. Hennes leads the one consisting of Sidney Crosby, Jake Guentzel, Conor Sheary, Brian Dumoulin, John Marino and Casey DeSmith. Penguins management blocks out time, typically about three hours, for a group to be inside.</p>
<p>Each day players must undergo temperature checks and record symptoms when they arrive. Masks must be worn when players are not working out. Sheary said Tuesday that he has also winced through multiple nasal swab tests.</p>
<p>“It’s not the most fun test to take,” the winger said, adding, “They pretty much stick a Q-tip way up your nostril. It feels like it’s in the back of your brain.”</p>
<p>Some days players hit the weight room first, with Hennes overseeing the Crosby group as it goes through workouts designed by team strength coaches. Other days they skate first, with a maximum of 60 minutes for on-ice workouts.</p>
<p>When time is up for a group, the players leave the facility, long gone when the next group of six arrives. Hennes said the staff at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex must first thoroughly sanitize wherever the last group had been.</p>
<p>“The rink is as clean as it’s ever been,” he said. “I think all the players do feel safe with the protocols that are set up, with the testing. You are quarantined in your own little bubble, your group, but it’s still a working environment.”</p>
<p>So what are these guys actually doing when they step onto the ice?</p>
<p>With a handful of exceptions, most NHL players had not been on skates since the season halted. Penguins strength coaches created dry-land workouts for individuals based on what equipment they had around their homes. Hennes provided skill drills for any player who asked. Some guys<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/11/jason-zucker-penguins-nhl-suspension-players-rollerblading/stories/202005110004?cid=search" target="_blank"> laced up rollerblades</a>.</p>
<p>“The work that they’ve done starting March 13 has put them in a great position,” Hennes said. “But hockey is an unfortunate sport in the sense that no matter how much exercise you do off the ice, there’s still nothing that can replicate the stress in the lungs and the burn in your legs from actually ice skating.”</p>
<p>Right now, the emphasis is on edge work, puck skills and shooting, just getting used to the feel of the ice and the puck again. There is no physical contact.</p>
<p>Hennes said “a leader” from each group will communicate with the supervisor about what they would like to focus on during the next day’s skate. The Penguins have a “playlist” of every drill coach Mike Sullivan ran the players through this season. Hennes will take that feedback and suggest specific drills to try.</p>
<p>“For a lot of guys, it’s getting back on the ice and feeling comfortable out there again. It’s getting your legs under you, getting your hands back,” Guentzel said. “There’s a lot of different things you’re working on. ... Each day is different.”</p>
<p>An NHL sheet of ice is 200 feet long and 85 wide. But that is not a ton of space for elite players, who can go goal line to goal line in about as much time it takes you to get a sip of hot coffee. Steps are taken to practice social distancing.</p>
<p>Many of the drills Hennes recommends separate the players into stations.</p>
<p>“At one station, one player works on puck-handling. In the neutral zone, one player is working on a skating pattern. At the far end, another guy is working on shooting. And then there’s three different stations on the opposite side,” he said. “They may go for two or three minutes a station and then they rotate.”</p>
<p>By stacking up all those individual drills over a few weeks, the Penguins hope to have their players ready for competitive line rushes, physical contact and draining puck battles along the boards during Phase 3, the training camp phase.</p>
<p>“The players are just building that engine in Phase 2,” Hennes explained.</p>
<p>The NHL is targeting July 10 for Phase 3. The league has not announced how long camps will be. Many have speculated they could last three weeks.</p>
<p>Hennes said the biggest challenge over Phases 2 and 3 will be managing player workloads to avoid injury and fatigue while preparing them for what they hope will be a long playoff grind. That will take a collective effort among players, the medical staff, coaches and strength and sports performance staffers.</p>
<p>“We are in a condensed period of time to get players to go into the most intense period of time in playoff hockey. We need to be smart with our daily workouts,” Hennes said. “I think just managing the workload and the physical stress we put on the players through the training camp will be imperative.”</p>
