<h1>Synagogue shooting webinar explores antisemitism and racism</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jews and non-Jews, an estimated 300 people from around the country, crowded a virtual seminar this week to discuss antisemitism, racism and community response.</p>
<p>The webinar Tuesday was inspired by the oral history project “<a href="https://hac.bard.edu/programs/meanings/" target="_blank">Meanings of Oct. 27</a>,” that began as a result of the&nbsp;shootings that killed 11 and wounded six at the Tree of Life-Or L’Simcha synagogue in Squirrel Hill in 2018.</p>
<p>“After the Synagogue Shooting: Pittsburghers Reflect on Antisemitism and Racism” is the initiative of Aliza Becker, an associate fellow at the Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities at Bard College in New York, and Noah Schoen, a Pittsburgher who lives in Boston and who had just completed a fellowship with the Jewish Organizing Institute and Network for Justice when Ms. Becker contacted him.</p>
<p>The Zoom program, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svpaocRJHPI" target="_blank">now on YouTube</a>, asked attendees what brought them to the discussion and what they were curious to learn about. Samantha Shokin, the host, manages public programs for the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York, which hosted the webinar.</p>
<p>She reported “a flood of comments.” Throughout the hourlong program, comments sometimes appeared so rapidly on the computer screen that you couldn’t read one before it was covered by another: “...to learn and understand why people treat people as others…” “How can I as a non-Jew help?” “.. to learn more and … resilience.</p>
<p>“They’re out to get us.” “I was taught that it will happen again.”&nbsp;“...serious problems with racial slurs in… school system.”</p>
<p>The group discussed nuances that keep racism and antisemitism from being synonymous.&nbsp;Among the speakers, Jasiri X drew numerous comments for his reflections.</p>
<p>“I never really looked at the history of the Jewish experience in the world, of being persecuted, looking for signs, being very sensitive to language. For a Black person, my life has been about being dehumanized,” said the founder and CEO of 1Hood Media.</p>
<p>He said that in his discussions with Jews after the synagogue shootings, he listened to their comments about antisemitic language,&nbsp;“and I thought, in my mind ... that’s not a big deal. But I was looking at it through my experiences. My experiences and my people’s experiences and not somebody else’s. So I’ve had those moments where I was like,“Oh, OK.”</p>
<p>Jasiri X talked about the “Stronger than Hate” T-shirts that so many people wore after the synagogue shootings. The shirts showed a yellow Star of David as part of the iconic logo of U.S. Steel and the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
<p>“For a Black person to see that, it’s something you wish was true but doesn’t apply to you,” he said.</p>
<p>“Ouch,” came one comment, then, “seconding that ouch” and “heartbreaking.”</p>
<p>Mr. Schoen noted that between 12% and 15% of Jews are not white.</p>
<p>Ms. Becker said Jews need to grapple with the challenge of racism, including among their own: “How can we be better listeners, to root supportive action in deep listening?”</p>
<p>Leslie Aizenman, director for refugee and immigrant services at Jewish Family and Community Services, was asked how the shootings have affected her. She referenced the onset of the Nazi regime, when people had to make decisions.</p>
<p>“It’s like the canary in the coal mine,” she said. “Do I leave? Where do I go? Everyone talks about how the smart people got out in time.”</p>
<p>Mr. Schoen said there is not agreement about what antisemitism is or what should be done about it, but he said that non-Jewish Pittsburghers “are reckoning with antisemitism and some are really listening.”</p>
<p>Near the end of the discussion, a comment read, “Please come to do a talk in Santa Barbara when COVID is over.”</p>
<p>Mr. Schoen, who grew up in Squirrel Hill, said he saw an opportunity&nbsp;“to come back to Pittsburgh and go through my processing of the shootings.&nbsp;My background is in community organizing, and I am interested in the stories communities have, all the individual stories that make up the communal story. There’s a quote I love: Throughout history, the truth is a multi-vocal art.</p>
<p>“One of our hopes is that this will be an archive that is engaged with, a tool of community research. We&nbsp;hope this is just the beginning of finding ways to open up spaces for people to engage — Pittsburghers and people beyond Pittsburgh. When you listen to someone talk about antisemitism, the opportunity for transformation begins with the listener saying, ‘What’s my relationship with antisemitism?’”</p>
<p>He said the goal of the oral history project is to complete all interviews by the end of 2020. The project will be housed at the&nbsp;Rauh Jewish History Program &amp; Archives at the Heinz History Center. Its director,&nbsp;Eric Lidji, said the value of the oral history project is multifaceted.</p>
<p>“[It] will be a deep and definitive record of local perspectives from the first years after the attack — before a collective narrative begins to coalesce and harden,” he said. “Archival documents are remarkable in many ways, as evidence, as illustration, as something tangible from the past. But they are always brought to life by the simple addition of actual human speech, just as a breeze can make the tallest trees sway.</p>
<p>“Today, these oral histories will provide comfort, encourage conversations. In the future, they will be an invaluable source of insight into the places our hearts and minds have traveled these past few years.”</p>
