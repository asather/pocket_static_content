<h1>Man sentenced for abuse in Ohio Amish community</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WARREN, Ohio — For the second time in less than a week, members of an Amish community sat in a courtroom where one of their own was sentenced to prison for sexually molesting a minor from their community.</p>
<p>Judge Andrew Logan of the Trumbull County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas sentenced Daniel Ray Kurtz to two years in prison. Kurtz had pleaded guilty in December to two counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for engaging a 14-year-old boy in oral sex in the summer of 2019 at his rural home in Middlefield, Ohio.</p>
<p>A half-dozen men and women from his Amish community, dressed in modest, dark suits and dresses,&nbsp;observed Tuesday’s sentencing.</p>
<p>Looking on from elsewhere in the courtroom were about 10 advocates for victims of child sexual abuse in Amish and related churches. They had traveled from various Ohio counties, part of a growing trend throughout the region, in which they’re showing up for court hearings in silent solidarity with victims.</p>
<p>Kurtz made a statement of remorse, and his attorneys noted that this was his first criminal conviction.</p>
<p>But Judge Logan pointed out that during the pre-sentencing investigation, Kurtz had admitted to having molested other children.</p>
<p>“You further acknowledged other violations with other children,” Judge Logan said. That&nbsp;“belies the suggestion that you’re not a potential recidivist.”</p>
<p>The judge did not indicate when the earlier abuse occurred or whether it is under investigation.</p>
<p>“It is a very serious offense,” Judge Logan said.&nbsp;“… When you have relations with a minor child, that affects them for the rest of their lives.”</p>
<p>After the sentencing, Kurtz, 54, was handcuffed and led out by officers for transportation to prison. While he was being walked up the courtroom aisle, one of the women from his community briefly clutched his arm in a gesture of support. Another wiped away tears during the hearing.</p>
<p>Members of the group declined to comment to a reporter afterward.</p>
<p>In a separate case last Friday, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/24/Lancaster-County-Amish-David-Stoltzfus-Smucker-sentencing-sex-abuse/stories/202001240122" target="_blank">David Stoltzfus Smucker</a>&nbsp;was sentenced in Lancaster, Pa., to at least 38 years in prison for his convictions on 20 felony counts of sexually abusing four girls. Attending that hearing were members of a Lancaster County Amish community that included Smucker and the victims, as well as victims’ advocates who had traveled from various parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia.</p>
<p>In its 2019 series, <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coverings/mennonite-amish-sexual-abuse-forgiveness-in-their-communities/" target="_blank">Coverings</a>, the Post-Gazette reported on growing awareness of child sexual abuse in conservative Mennonite, Amish and related “Plain” Anabaptist communities.</p>
<p>Historically, church leaders have often treated such offenses as sins to be dealt with through church discipline rather than crimes to be reported. Because of the Anabaptists’ emphasis on forgiveness, victims have reported being pressured to reconcile with their abusers who make a show of repentance.</p>
<p>Plain church leadership is highly decentralized, but leaders in major Plain population centers say they’ve improved cooperation with law-enforcement agencies and their understanding of abuse as a compulsive and devastating crime. Advocates say progress is uneven.</p>
<p>After the Kurtz sentencing on Tuesday, a relative of the victim said she hoped it would help set an example in the Amish community of the need to hold offenders to account.</p>
<p>“I do appreciate the judge’s bringing up the fact it was not just a one-time offense,” said Cindy Coblentz, who grew up in the local Amish community before leaving it, and who continues to live nearby.</p>
<p>“I’m all for forgiving all those who have offended you, but that does not free them from the consequences of their actions,” she said. Someone with&nbsp;“true repentance would be willing to face the consequences of their actions.”</p>
<p>Others who attended in solidarity with the victim, who was not in court, echoed the words.</p>
<p>Barbara Ann Miller of Trumbull County said it was important to be&nbsp;“a voice for the innocent children that have no voice.”</p>
<p>In addition to his prison sentence, the judge said Kurtz would have to register as a sex offender for the next 25 years.</p>
