<h1>As lanternfly proliferates, quarantine imposed on companies traveling through Allegheny, Beaver counties</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny and Beaver counties have been added to a quarantine zone intended to minimize the impact of a “bad bug.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/outdoors/2019/10/06/spotted-lanternfly-Pennsylvania-Penn-State-Extension/stories/201910060043" target="_blank">Pennsylvania’s spotted lanternfly</a> quarantine, initially imposed on several eastern counties, requires the owners of commercial vehicles traveling into or out of the quarantined counties to obtain a free permit verifying that the driver of the vehicle can recognize and will remove spotted laternflies and their egg masses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Russell Redding, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, announced Tuesday that 12 counties were added to the quarantine zone. The counties added Tuesday were Allegheny, Beaver, Blair, Columbia, Cumberland, Huntingdon, Juniata, Luzerne, Mifflin, Northumberland, Perry and York. With this addition, the quarantine for this invasive pest now covers 26 counties.</p>
<p>"The spotted lanternfly is more than a pest in the literal sense," said Mr. Redding. "It's wreaking havoc for home and business owners; kids who just want to play outside; Pennsylvania agriculture and the economy of the state we all call home. Whether you think it's your job or not, we need every Pennsylvanian to keep their eyes peeled for signs of this bad bug — to scrape every egg mass, squash every bug, and report every sighting. We need to unite over our hatred for this pest for our common love: Pennsylvania."</p>
<p>Native to eastern Asia, the spotted lanternfly has no predators or controls in the United States. Lycorma delicatula likes to suck the sap out of apple trees, grape vines, some hardwood trees and other high-value agricultural crops and timber.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2020/01/19/Spotted-lanternfly-costing-Pennsylvania-damage-destroy-invasive-hardwoods-industry/stories/202001190037" target="_blank">Penn State released a study</a> that said the lanternfly is costing the state economy about $50 million and eliminating nearly 500 jobs annually.</p>
<p>The new counties under quarantine are not completely infested, but include municipalities with a confirmed infestation.</p>
<p>"Most of these municipalities have already been aggressively treated," said Dr. Ruth Welliver, director of the Bureau of Plant Industry. "With continued aggressive treatment and monitoring, and an actively engaged community, we can strike spotted lanternfly from these counties."</p>
<p>Shannon Powers, spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department, said Tuesday’s quarantine additions were a preemptive strike in advance of the insect’s spring hatching in mid-May. Spotted lanternflies are not alive during the winter months, but their egg masses survive winters at Pennsylvania’s latitude.</p>
<p>“In late autumn, egg masses were confirmed in parts of [Allegheny and Beaver counties],” she said.&nbsp;“When we get reports like that we send a team out and they surveyed the area. There’s no treatment other than to scrape off the masses and smash the eggs. Now we’re asking everyone to look around their areas and do the same thing.”</p>
<p>The response team that inspected municipalities in Allegheny and Beaver counties was funded through a Rapid Response Disaster Readiness clause included in the 2019 Pennsylvania Farm Bill. The bill proposes another $3 million to combat the spotted lanternfly, plus an additional $1 million in uncommitted funding to be available in the event of the next agricultural disaster.</p>
<p>The egg masses can be found on outside wood, including firewood and loading pallets; stone, including walls and rocks; and plastic. The masses look like a brown smear. Inside are neat rows of 30 to 50 eggs.</p>
<p>The permit is required of businesses, agencies and organizations located or working within the&nbsp;spotted lanternfly quarantine zone that move vehicles, products or other conveyances within or out of the quarantined area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quarantine applies to trucking firms, train lines and any company that sends vehicles of any kind into or out of the impacted zones.</p>
<p>Spotted lanternfly permits can be obtained by responding to a questionnaire at&nbsp;agriculture.pa.gov, search keywords&nbsp;“spotted lanternfly permitting.” The questionnaire is intended to educate company owners and managers and requires that they instruct employees on how to identify and kill spotted lanternflies. The fine for noncompliance can be up to $300 for a criminal citation, or up to $20,000 for a civil penalty.</p>
<p>Ms. Powers said the permits will be required after the information is published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, a process expected to take a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>She said many firms in southwestern Pennsylvania already have spotted lanternfly permits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Folks don’t want their businesses to be brought to a screeching halt by embargoes, which is always a possibility,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homeowners and residents within quarantine zones are encouraged to contact their regional Penn State Extension office to learn more about spotted lanternfly management.</p>
