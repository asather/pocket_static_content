<h1>Chief U.S. judge bars all court visitors, employees, prisoners with possible COVID-19 exposure</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The chief federal judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania on Friday imposed restrictions on people who will be allowed to enter federal courthouses, barring anyone who might have COVID-19 or may have been exposed to someone who does.</p>
<p>The federal courthouses in Pittsburgh, Erie and Johnstown remain open for business and judges are handling cases, although most have been postponed and the majority of court employees are working from home.</p>
<p>But Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak said he is closely monitoring the virus outbreak and is following the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control in trying to control it.</p>
<p>His order bars these people from entering a U.S. courthouse:</p>
<p>Anyone who, because of exposure to COVID-19 or travel to a country or region with an outbreak, has been advised to quarantine themselves or is self-quarantining; people who live with or have close contact with someone who has been advised to self-quarantine; people who have traveled to a foreign country in the 14 days before trying to enter the courthouse; and anyone with one or more of the symptoms of respiratory illness such as a cough, fever, nasal discharge or shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Anyone trying to enter one of the buildings, including those who have meetings at the U.S. probation offices, will be asked to confirm that none of those factors apply to them. If they are barred for one of the reasons listed, they are to contact whatever party they were planning to visit to explain their circumstance, the judge ruled.</p>
<p>Those who feel they are being wrongfully denied entry are asked to contact the judge's chambers at 412-208-7433.</p>
<p>The judge said the new rules also apply to court employees, grand jurors and prisoners brought in by the U.S. marshals.</p>
