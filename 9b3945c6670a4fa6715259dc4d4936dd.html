<h1>Paul Zeise mailbag: Will a lack of fans spark a lack of interest in sports?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Joe:&nbsp;</strong>Do you think sports coming back with no fans will cause some people to not watch, or do you think it won't make a difference?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> This is a great question. I had to read a few times to really come up with an answer. It makes a lot of sense to me why you would ask it, but my honest answer is I don’t know. I think a big part of the fan experience is engagement with the team. Fans like the tangible part of sports — being able to see games live, get autographs, get photographs, be in the stadium, go to training camp, etc. None of that will happen this year in any sport. I think we are so sports-starved that people will initially come back and watch sports, and I think the NFL will be fine in this category. I could easily see people not caring nearly as much about the NHL and NBA now that we are into the July/August grind of the summer. People have also gotten used to not watching sports or relying on sports for their nightly entertainment. My gut tells me that fans will watch the games, but I don’t know what the ratings will ultimately be.</p>
<p><strong>Jaxson:</strong> Are the Patriots, now that they signed Cam Newton, the most overrated team in football? They still look like an 8-8 team to me, but some people have them in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> They are going to be viewed as one of the Super Bowl contenders, but that is premature. If Newton is healthy and back to some version of what he was, yes, they will legitimately be contenders. I just don’t know how anyone could know what he is going to be and whether he will legitimately be back to normal. And he will still have the same problem Tom Brady had last year: he doesn’t have any weapons, and that is a big problem for any quarterback. They are the Patriots and they still have Bill Belichick, so they will be a factor, but I agree with you that they are probably not Super Bowl contenders.</p>
<p><strong>Chad:</strong> With nobody remaining on the Steelers roster from the 2016 draft just 4 years later, is it safe to say that was the worst draft class in Steelers history?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> That is a really bad draft because none of those players except for Javon Hargrave panned out, and even he had a mostly limited role until last season. Artie Burns was a bust. Sean Davis was barely average. Tyler Matakavich was a good value in the seventh round, but for the most part the draft was bad. The 1997 draft wasn’t very strong, either, but first-round pick Chad Scott was worlds better than Burns, so 2016 is worse.</p>
<p><strong>Trags:</strong>&nbsp;Are the Pittsburgh MLB media guys the only people who don’t think Yaisel Puig is mentally ill? All of the rest of MLB thinks he has severe problems and that is why he is available.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> The push for Puig is kind of funny, isn’t it? It reminds me of the push for Jameis Winston, Cam Newton and every other backup quarterback on the planet for the Steelers a month or so ago. Puig would not fit with the Pirates. I don’t know if he is mentally ill but he is a bad clubhouse guy, a selfish player and not the kind of influence you want in your clubhouse full of young players. There is no good reason for the Pirates to even entertain signing him.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> What are your thoughts on Boomer Esiason hinting that Southern football teams are purposely trying to develop herd immunity now so they don’t lose players during the season?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> It is very irresponsible, especially given who he is and the time we are living in. People are on edge and way too willing to believe any conspiracy that comes down the pike. Esiason has a lot of credibility so when he says something like this, a portion of people will believe it. I don’t know if it is true or not, but let me just put it this way: That is a hell of an accusation to make and one that you better have proof of if you are going to make it. Now think about it logically. Do you really believe that coaches, administrators and strength coaches would knowingly expose their players to a deadly virus given all the issues around liability and everything else that would go with it? If one kid has some condition that they don’t know about gets extremely sick or dies, do you realize the issues the school, program and coaches would have? It would be a huge lawsuit, probably resulting in criminal charges, and not one person on that staff would ever work in college athletics again. It isn’t even logical, so to entertain that thought is, in my opinion, irresponsible and not at all helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Greg:</strong> How can you put up with Andrew Philliponi? All he does is troll Pittsburgh fans and give hot takes that are just designed to get people upset with him. Isn’t he supposed to be pumping up the local teams? I know he is your co-worker at the radio station but you can’t possibly like working with him.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Well, first of it is Fillipponi, with an F not a Ph. He is a good friend of mine and he is actually very good at what he does. The fact that you — and so many others — are so frustrated with him that you wrote to my mailbag about it speaks volumes on this. Columnists, radio hosts, opinion makers in general — the job is to try and make people think. If you can write or say something that is intelligent, well-thought out and a strong opinion, you accomplish this. Yes, his schtick is to be the&nbsp;“Syracuse guy who hates Pitt’” troll and he likes to get a rise out of people by challenging conventional wisdom. But if you listen to him, he backs it all up with data — OK, except for when he names Doug Marrone as one of the top 10 NFL coaches, that was just dumb — and is one of the most well-researched people in this business. He is actually good at what he does. People just need to learn not to react to some of his hot takes.</p>
