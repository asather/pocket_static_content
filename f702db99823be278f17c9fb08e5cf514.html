<h1>Families of nursing home residents upset with owners’ statement on COVID-19 deaths</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Families of current and past residents who have died at the Beaver County nursing home that has the worst and most deadly COVID-19 outbreak in the state said Wednesday they were incensed by a statement by the home’s owners Tuesday regarding the number of deaths and positive cases there.</p>
<p>“Wow. That place, man. I don’t even know what to say about that place anymore,” said Keri Boyer, whose father, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/06/Brighton-Rehab-and-Wellness-Beaver-PA-nursing-home-coronavirus-positive-cases/stories/202004060124" target="_blank">Earl Denbow Jr., 73, died April 3</a> after contracting COVID-19 at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center. “I think that’s just them covering their [butts]; that’s what I think.”</p>
<p>The nursing home’s owners issued the statement late Tuesday night to the Post-Gazette <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/28/Disturbing-events-at-Beaver-County-nursing-home-as-COVID-19-deaths-rise-to-52/stories/202004280137" target="_blank">after a dramatic increase in the number of resident deaths&nbsp;</a>from COVID-19 at the nursing home — from 39 to 52 — was posted earlier in the day by the state Department of Health. On Wednesday the count rose even higher, to 58 cases, as did the number of positive cases at the home to 248.</p>
<p>The state does not specifically identify which nursing homes the cases occurred at but does list them by county. Based on that information, the Post-Gazette was able to figure out the total number of cases and deaths that occurred at Brighton Rehabilitation — a figure the building’s owners did not dispute in their statement.</p>
<p>In that statement, the nursing home said, in part: “In the last two months, the number of staff and residents at Brighton is approximately a thousand people. Approximately 75% of those people have seemingly been unaffected by Covid19. Of the 25% who were affected, a percentage have passed after being diagnosed.”</p>
<p>“It should be understood that some of these people passed from non-Covid related illnesses, or natural causes. Once a person is diagnosed, the death is mis-recorded as a Covid death, even when Covid played no role. Some residents who passed were on hospice care. Others passed due to Covid19, but might have been saved had they not had advanced directives prohibiting life-saving measures, and in some cases life-sustaining treatment. Conversely, there is a large group of residents who were diagnosed as Covid+, that have now seemingly fully recovered, and returned to baseline. The number who have recovered well exceeds fifty, and many more are on their way to recovery,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Barbara Peer, whose boyfriend, Rich Edmonds, 81, <a href="https://www.copelandfuneralhomes.com/obituary/MRichard-Edmunds" target="_blank">died on April 14 at Brighton Rehabilitation</a> after contracting COVID-19, said the statement sounded to her as if they treat the nursing home “like it’s just a holding cell. Like, ‘Here we are, we’re just a bunch of old folks sitting here waiting to die.’”</p>
<p>“Rich wasn’t about to die,” she said. “He had dementia. But [operators of a horse therapy site he visited in good weather] were talking about getting him on a horse in April.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to see [Brighton] close down. It’s just so awful,” she said.</p>
<p>Jodi Gill, whose father, Glenn Gill, 81, is still a resident at Brighton Rehabilitation, sued the state Department of Health on Tuesday because she believes the state failed to properly oversee what she believes was the use of an inappropriate experimental treatment on her father and others at the nursing home.</p>
<p>She said the statement by Brighton Rehabilitation’s owners did not surprise her.</p>
<p>“I think that [statement] is ridiculous,” said Ms. Gill, of Ambridge. “I think they’re cooking the numbers [of cases and deaths], and they’ve been cooking the numbers the entire time.”</p>
<p>She was particularly upset with the owners’ use of the argument that because of the way they have to classify the death of anyone with COVID-19, that their deaths are “mis-recorded” as COVID-19-related, even if they died of some other cause but had tested positive for the infection.</p>
<p>“The nicest way I can say it is I think they’re negligent at best,” she said.</p>
<p>Her attorney handling a federal class-action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Bob Daley, said the owners’ list of reasons why people died reads like a laundry list of excuses.</p>
<p>“They’re just worried about liability,” Mr. Daley said.</p>
<p>He noted, however, that Ms. Gill is not asking for financial damages in her lawsuit.</p>
<p>“We just want the state Department of Health to get in there and find out what’s going on,” he said.</p>
<p>During her Wednesday online news conference, Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said the state is doing all it can to help Brighton Rehabilitation and its residents and staff.</p>
<p>“Certainly the situation at the Brighton nursing home has been extremely challenging and we’re doing absolutely everything we can to help that home,” Dr. Levine said. “We actually have installed a temporary manager to help the facility. We have contracted and brought in our consultant, ECRI, to do infection control and education. We have pushed out personal protective equipment. We have more than daily phone calls. And so we are concentrating on that nursing home, doing everything we can to protect the vulnerable residents and staff.”</p>
<p>That was the first time Dr. Levine or anyone with the state has said anything about installing a manager to help Brighton Rehabilitation. But no additional details were provided Wednesday.</p>
<p>ECRI, formerly known as the Emergency Care Research Institute, is a nonprofit organization in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. It is a frequent contractor for the state’s Department of Health.</p>
<p>On its website, ECRI says it works with providers, insurers, government agencies and medical associations to improve “the safety, quality and cost-effectiveness of care across all healthcare settings worldwide.”</p>
<p>But ECRI is not working on-site.</p>
<p>Dr. Karen Schoelles, ECRI’s vice president of clinical excellence and safety, said the organization is providing information and education by phone to Brighton Rehabilitation’s staff when they have questions about infection control issues.</p>
<p>“Sometimes we’re just on the phone with them listening and trying to find additional information for them,” Dr. Schoelles said Wednesday. “They might ask what they should do for patients who have to leave the building to go to therapy, like dialysis or physical therapy, and we help them figure that out.”</p>
<p>Because Brighton Rehabilitation is short-staffed and has high demand now for assistance with residents, some of those questions are coming from people who normally work in administration but don’t know basic information about how to properly put on a mask or other personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>She said ECRI is working with about 80 nursing homes across the state, and the issues that Brighton Rehabilitation is working with are fairly common in each of them.</p>
<p>“In general what we’re finding out is the people are panicking in the long-term care facilities because they weren’t adequately prepared,” she said. “Sometimes we’re just telling them to calm down and trying to help them.”</p>
<p>“It’s certainly not a normal situation for this to be happening in any nursing home,” she said.</p>
