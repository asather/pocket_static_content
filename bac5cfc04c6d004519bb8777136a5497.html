<h1>Zoom reports widespread outage of videoconferencing platform</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Zoom users were unable to join meetings Monday as the online teleconferencing company worked to resolve outages nationwide.</p>
<p>Zoom meetings and webinars are experiencing partial outages, the company said on its status page, which it began investigating before 10 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>People in North America and parts of Europe have been reporting problems with the service, according to the website Down Detector.</p>
<p>Zoom did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the scope of the problem. But on social media the company is responding to people’s complaints by saying: “We have received reports of users being unable to start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars. We are currently investigating and will provide updates as we have them. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.”</p>
<p>Zoom’s phone and chat services are still online, the company notes on the status page. The outages for meetings and webinars are tied to an authentication problem with Zoom’s website, which the company says it has identified and is working to fix.</p>
<p>Created as a business communication tool nearly a decade ago, Zoom's popularity exploded at the beginning of this year, as millions of people in lockdown began using it to host events ranging from birthday parties to religious events and even to cabinet meetings.</p>
<p>The company grew from 10 million users in December to more than 300 million daily meeting participants today.</p>
