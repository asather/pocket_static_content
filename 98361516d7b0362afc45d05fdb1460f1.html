<h1>Inside bench coach Don Kelly's pivotal role at Pirates camp</h1>

<p>BRADENTON, Fla. – Imagine having to account for the needs of nearly 100 men of various ages. Some of them are coworkers who will be teaching alongside you. One is your boss, who will oversee the entire operation but has entrusted you with a pivotal part of it.</p>
<p>You have to plan out arrivals. Then you have to structure specific activities that enlighten and entertain them. You have to factor in that some are audial learners, and some are visual.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that you also have to build a new culture at a job you’ve only been working for less than 90 days, with most of the group meeting you for the first time.</p>
<p>Think you can handle it? Probably not.</p>
<p>But Don Kelly can, and that’s the task in his first season as Pirates bench coach. Kelly designs the structure of big-league camp for the Pirates. He picks the hitting, pitching and fielding groups. He decides what time every one of the players is at his specific station.</p>
<p>“It’s a process. We’ve tweaked a couple of things,” Kelly said.” I think there’s always going to be adjustments that you can make because ultimately, we want to make it the best for the players out on the field, and make sure that we try to be as efficient as we can to get them out there, get the work in and get them off the field into the waiting room or whatever it is.”</p>
<p>Thursday was a productive day on and off the field for the Pirates. The Mt. Lebanon native is responsible for making sure it moved smoothly.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s exciting. The guys, they’re pumped up, they’re coming out, there’s a lot of energy, and guys are excited to be here and get started,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>Pirates manager Derek Shelton wants to make the camp as individualized as possible while serving the greater good of the unit. Reaching that goals requires daily and sometimes hourly adjustments to previous plans.</p>
<p>“As you sit there and look at it and meet with the staff in the morning and ask for input, and in their area of how we could adjust it to make it better, we’re always looking to do that,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Kelly, he has the wisdom of Shelton at his disposal.</p>
<p>“It’s been a process, talking to Derek and the staff and working our way through it,” Kelly said. You want to be efficient and get the guys the work in that they need but not have them out there all day. But Shelty was unbelievable and helped me through it. He’s done it the last couple of years in Minnesota. He was a tremendous help.”</p>
<p>Kelly got to work immediately after taking the bench coach job in December. There were a lot of phone calls between him and Shelton before the team landed in Florida. Shelton had a witty retort when asked the hardest part of working with Kelly.</p>
<p>“The difficulties for me were making sure he didn’t screw it up,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>The new manager quickly got down to business in the next few moments.</p>
<p>“He’s done a good job with it. He’s been very diligent with it,” Shelton said. “It takes a lot of time and effort. So far, its been clean and smooth. Everyone has been in their right spot. He’s done a great job so far.”</p>
<p>Players are noticing that practice time isn’t as long as last year’s camp. They get their work done and get more time to recover. Josh Bell saw that quickly on his first day in camp Thursday.</p>
<p>“There is going to be a lot of individual work for players on what they need to get better at,” Bell said explicitly. “Instead of a group taking groundballs, it’ll be more about each guy getting the work they need each day. Everything we’re doing has a purpose.”</p>
<p>Kelly believes that if the Pirates stick to the plan, they can catch people sleeping on them in 2020.</p>
<p>“We have the guys to go out there and compete,” Kelly said. “To watch what they did last year in the first half, I know that the second half was rough, but there’s talent on the team.”</p>
