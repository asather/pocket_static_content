<h1>Pirates ‘doing our part’ for MLB COVID-19 test</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Four hundred members of the Pirates organization will voluntarily participate in a massive study for COVID-19 antibodies that was announced on Tuesday, part of a 10,000-person sample size to be obtained across Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>The study, which was first reported by ESPN.com, is aimed at quantifying how widespread COVID-19 is in metropolitan areas across the country. It’s being run by Stanford University, USC and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory (SMRTL).</p>
<p>Volunteers will be in both Pittsburgh and Bradenton, said Pirates vice president of communications and broadcasting Brian Warecki. Many of those people picked up their testing materials on Monday.</p>
<p>“We’re doing our part to help researchers gather needed information,” Warecki said.</p>
<p>Baseball’s wide swath was apparently enticing, as it will include players, front-office staff, concession workers and others — including a variety of races and nationalities.</p>
<p>The test kits draw blood via a pinprick and produce results in around 10 minutes.</p>
<p>According to ESPN, the test looks for IgM, an antibody that’s present in those with COVID-19, as well as IgG, which doctors have said lasts long after an infection occurs.</p>
<p>A positive test tells the taker he or she did contract COVID-19, regardless of symptoms. Unlike other testing, the IgG/IgM tests do not detect active COVID-19.</p>
<p>Those running the study made sure to note that, by MLB participating, it does not expedite the sport’s return — other than how this might impact society’s efforts to combat COVID-19.</p>
<p>The test kits will not take away from front-line workers or decrease the ability of the most vulnerable to be tested, Dr. Daniel Eichner, the president of SMRTL, told ESPN.com.</p>
<p>"MLB did not partner with us for any selfish reason to get their sport back sooner," Eichner told ESPN. "They jumped in for public health policy. That was their intention and their only intention."</p>
