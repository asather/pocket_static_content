<h1>Democrats need to do some flipping to find electoral college success</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the Democratic presidential field narrows to two front-runners with different ideological bents, their campaigns and the national groups gearing up to support their general election bids are eyeing several different geographic paths to win back the White House, starting pragmatically in the Rust Belt —&nbsp;where experts say it’s easiest —&nbsp;to more aspirational routes in the Sun Belt.</p>
<p>The path to beating President Donald Trump and securing the necessary 270 electoral votes will require the eventual Democratic nominee —&nbsp;either former Vice President Joe Biden or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders —&nbsp;to hold onto all the states that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 while flipping a combination of states that Mr. Trump carried.</p>
<p>The most conventional path, according to experts and pollsters, runs through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where Mr. Trump won by a total margin of about 77,000 votes en route to winning the electoral college, but not the nationwide popular vote. Democratic groups have been pouring resources into these three states since last year, aiming to convince working class voters and suburban women that Mr. Trump has not carried out his promises.</p>
<p>But with handicappers noting that Wisconsin has run more red since 2016, Democrats are also eyeing the swing state of Florida and traditionally-red states like Arizona, Texas and Georgia, where a win in even one would make the Midwest less of a mathematical necessity for the party’s nominee.</p>
<p>Kyle Kondik, who manages the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ D.C. office and edits its nonpartisan elections newsletter Sabato’s Crystal Ball, said no matter who the Democrats choose to be their nominee, the general election starts at a 50-50 toss-up against the incumbent Republican president.</p>
<p>In an analysis for the center released late last month, Mr. Kondik wrote that the Democrats nominating Mr. Sanders would start the party off with “somewhat of a penalty” in the electoral college, perhaps complicating his chances in the Sun Belt’s highly-educated suburbs.</p>
<p>“Certainly some Democrats would say that Sanders would start at a disadvantage. I think a lot of Republicans would say that, too, and I think Sanders would have more to prove in the Sun Belt than Biden, at least to start,” Mr. Kondik told the Post-Gazette, “but I think it’d be dangerous to write off Sanders as a possible general election winner, too.”</p>
<p>Both of the Democratic front-runners have insisted that they, unlike their opponent, would be best to win back the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by appealing to working class voters.</p>
<p>A recent memo from the Sanders campaign noted that he performs well against Mr. Trump in head-to-head general election polling in the three “industrial battleground states,” noting his strength with suburban voters, young people and the working class. It even pointed to a statement from Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, in which he said Mr. Sanders is “tough in places where people are making $12 an hour.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, too, has touted his appeal to working class voters that sided with Barack Obama twice then flipped to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Kondik said the former vice president could be more “palatable” in the suburban areas of Pennsylvania where Democrats will have to do better than they did four years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Tough to flip</strong></p>
<p>No matter the candidate, Wisconsin could be the hardest of the three for Democrats to flip, Mr. Kondik said, because it’s less diverse —&nbsp;and because Republican support in the suburbs of greater Milwaukee, for example, hasn’t eroded enough.</p>
<p>Charles Franklin, who has directed the Marquette Law School Poll in Wisconsin since its inception in 2012, said six polls since August have shown a tight race, with both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders running slightly ahead of Mr. Trump in most cases —&nbsp;but almost all within the margin of error. The school’s most recent poll in February showed Mr. Sanders over Mr. Trump by 1 percentage point and Mr. Biden tied with the president, though it was administered before three prominent moderates in the field lined up behind Mr. Biden.</p>
<p>Noting that Mr. Trump’s approval numbers have improved over the past year in Wisconsin with more favorable perceptions of the economy, Mr. Franklin said he expects a high turnout and a general election that could tip either way between now and November.</p>
<p>“An economic downturn would be a challenge for the incumbent,” Mr. Franklin said. “But perceptions of whether the Trump administration handles the coronavirus outbreak well or poorly is also likely to play a role as every president is judged by how they handle crises.”</p>
<p>While Mr. Kondik and several other experts consider Michigan an easier target for Democrats, his colleague, Seth Moskowitz, has pointed out that if the Democratic nominee wins there and in Florida, they would win the presidency even if Mr. Trump held onto Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump won Florida by about 1.2 percentage points in 2016 and launched his 2020 re-election campaign there.</p>
<p>Russell Tuff, chair of the Republican Party in Trump-friendly Collier County, Fla., said he’d have a difficult time imagining Florida not voting for Mr. Trump again, with income levels rising statewide and “anyone who wants to work [having] a job.”</p>
<p>“Unless some major catastrophe happens, why would anyone vote for a leadership change?” Mr. Tuff asked.</p>
<p>But according to the Tampa Bay Times, Democrats in Florida are heavily pursuing the state’s fastest growing demographic: Hispanics. The party has hired dozens of staffers there, many of whom are bilingual, to engage with Latino voters, The Times reported. Mr. Trump got about 35% of the Latino vote in 2016.</p>
<p>Mr. Moskowitz also has written that Democrats wouldn’t have to win any of the Midwestern states if they flipped Florida and Arizona, which Mr. Kondik deemed “the best target for Democrats among the usually Republican Sun Belt states that have been becoming more competitive.”</p>
<p>There hasn’t been a major poll of Arizona since early January, before the race consolidated. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders were in statistical ties with the president in head-to-head matchups, but Mr. Biden fared better in polls in 2019.</p>
<p>This week, Mr. Biden picked up the endorsement of U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., who said Mr. Biden represents “Arizona values.”</p>
<p>“I am voting for former Vice President Joe Biden — a pragmatic, practical leader best positioned to get things done for everyday families,” Ms. Sinema said in a statement passed along by the campaign.</p>
<p>Though Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told an Arizona Republic podcast recently that voters there rejected “Trumpism” in statewide elections in 2018, Mr. Trump rallied in the state in February, talking up the creation of more than 230,000 jobs in the state since he took office.</p>
<p>Of the two Democratic contenders, Mr. Kondik said polling suggests Mr. Biden might do better among white suburbanites in highly educated areas in Arizona, though he acknowledged “you could flip it around” and say that Mr. Sanders could inspire greater minority turnout.</p>
<p>The Sanders campaign has insisted he is strong with Latinos, which will help him in Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Texas.</p>
