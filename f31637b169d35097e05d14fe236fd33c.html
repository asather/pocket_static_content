<h1>Allegheny Health Network to resume full medical services</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny Health Network said Tuesday that it will resume elective surgeries and in-person appointments for other medical services for patients.</p>
<p>With the Pittsburgh region not seeing the large number of COVID-19 cases as the eastern part of the state, officials with the health system said they feel comfortable moving forward with providing full services.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, hospitals in the AHN network&nbsp;as well as those of competitor UPMC have restricted such elective surgeries, testing and preventative care at its facilities while it focused on treating coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>“It appears we have flattened the curve regionally, and at this point we are confident that we can safely resume clinical appointments and elective surgeries,” said Dr. Sri Chalikonda, AHN’s chief medical operations officer.</p>
<p>In a sign of increasing comfort with the gradual reopening of parts of the economy, the Pennsylvania Department of Health last week gave the go-ahead for hospitals to resume elective surgeries and in-person medical appointments under new guidelines.</p>
<p>The guidelines dictate that elective procedures can only resume if they will not "jeopardize the safety of patients and staff."&nbsp;The guidelines recommend that facilities ensure that they have enough ICU beds, test kits and personal protective equipment stockpiled and trained staff to manage a "surge" in COVID-19 cases. Facilities should also not have to resort to "crisis standards of care" in the event of a surge, state health officials said.</p>
<p>As it resumes more medical services, AHN said it will continue to screen patients and employees for COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors.&nbsp;Officials said COVID-19 patients will use separate entrances and treatment areas.</p>
<p>Further measures at AHN facilities will include: extending office hours with staggered staffing shifts to spread out the patient traffic flow; spacing out chairs in waiting rooms; and installing sneeze guards in reception areas and other patient areas.</p>
<p>Previously, people seeking medical care had been encouraged to use online telehealth services during the pandemic.</p>
