<h1>Shooting at Louisiana memorial service left 13 wounded</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At least 13 people were wounded, one critically, after a shooting in Bogalusa, La., on Saturday just after 9 p.m., according to the Bogalusa Police Department.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred near Martin Luther King Drive and East 4th Street, where a large crowd was gathered for a memorial service for a man who was recently found murdered and whose body had been left in the woods.</p>
<p>Bogalusa police said they began receiving calls about gunshots at 9:12 p.m. and responding officers arrived at the scene to find a large crowd gathered for what appeared to be a memorial service for Dominique Audrell James, who was found dead in his car Friday morning in a heavily wooded area a few miles west of the city.</p>
<p>James, 29, had been reported missing two days earlier.</p>
<p>"It is very unusual -- it would be unusual for any town," said Major Troy Tervalon, who was working on the case for the Bogalusa Police Department.</p>
<p>Tervalon said the police department did not yet have a motive for the homicide or the shooting that happened afterward, and officials were urging the public to come forward with any information that might help move the case forward.</p>
<p>He described the area around the scene as being sparsely populated with residences and a dollar store.</p>
<p>An adult man was in critical condition following the shooting, Tervalon said, adding that the police department was still gathering information on the conditions of the other victims because they had been taken to different area hospitals.</p>
<p>After the incident, the local police department found several victims with gun shot wounds and asked for help securing the scene. The Washington Parish Sheriff's Office, the Louisiana Fire Marshal's Office, Louisiana State Police, the Varnado Police Department, the Bogalusa Fire Department and Northshore EMS responded, officials said.</p>
<p>"All the law enforcement in Washington Parish responded to that," said Randy Seal, the Washington Parish Sheriff. "It was a horrible, unfortunate thing. I don't understand it."</p>
<p>As of Sunday morning no eye-witnesses have come forward yet, Tervalon added.</p>
