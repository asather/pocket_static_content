<h1>Derek Shelton clarifies what's important for Pirates' pregame routine</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CINCINNATI — On Saturday, Josh Bell made the joke, after homering for the second game in a row without taking pregame batting practice, that he may never take batting practice again.</p>
<p>It was said with the first baseman’s tongue firmly in cheek, but Monday, when manager Derek Shelton was asked about Bell’s production with a reference to the batting practice comment, Shelton made the point that he actually doesn’t mind if Bell does or doesn’t take batting practice before games.</p>
<p>“The batting practice thing really gets overblown because, honestly, our guys can take batting practice any day they want and not take batting practice any day they want,” Shelton said. “One of the things that I learned the longer that I was the hitting coach was that traditional batting practice is extremely overrated. It depends on how you take it. Guys can go out and take it and just hit homers; guys can go out and take it and work on things. Because it’s an allotted period of time, it’s really not functional.”</p>
<p>Shelton went on to say that batting cage work or early batting practice, when coaches and players can have more instructional time, is far more important to the Pirates.</p>
<p>That is true in trying to improve the team this season, but it’s also true in the Pirates’ front office evaluation of their team going forward.</p>
<p>By the time this 60-game season ends, there will still be question marks on their roster. It is hard to draw a definite conclusion on any player within that small of a sample size.</p>
<p>Some of that pregame work, however, can serve the dual purposes of both helping players work on their game and showing how they develop in this time, hopefully helping to project where they will be in the future.</p>
<p>“The pregame work can be identified a bunch of different ways,” Shelton said. “Pregame work can be identified as early BP time where it’s just [hitting coach Rick Eckstein] and a certain two players on the field and making evaluation. Or doing [velocity] machine or curveball machine, a live [batting practice] setting of watching guys throw. It can be bullpen setting in the cage. It could actually just be in the cage doing work.”</p>
<p>Yes, for some that includes a normal round of batting practice for games. For others, it doesn’t. For Shelton and the Pirates, the point is more identifying which players can and can’t benefit from different pregame workouts and using that time in the most effective way possible.</p>
<p>“A lot of traditional batting practice helps with outfield defense. ... [Cole] Tucker being out in the outfield because he’s getting true reads with balls off the bat, Jason Martin being in the outfield getting true reads off the bat,” Shelton said. “But the guys actually hitting? For some of them it’s important but for other guys it’s not important — or as important is a better way to put it.”</p>
<p><strong>Positional flexibility strikes again</strong></p>
<p>In Sunday’s blowout loss to the Kansas City Royals, Shelton moved Tucker to the infield, his natural position, for the first time all season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past, Shelton has made similar moves in blowouts with the next day in mind, giving them a chance to see the field in a low-pressure situation before starting them there the next game.</p>
<p>That is not the case here, since Tucker was back in the outfield for Game 1 against the Reds. Instead, Shelton viewed it as a chance to keep Tucker comfortable with a position he may still play at times in the future.</p>
<p>“Just a chance to get him back in the infield with it being out of hand,” Shelton said. “I wanted to get Martin on the field and get [second baseman Adam Frazier] off the field because he’s probably played more than anybody except for [Colin Moran], and C-Mo has [played designated hitter] in about half those games. ... So I wanted to get him back on the infield. He didn’t get any ground balls, but to get in the flow of his timing and how he’s feeling and being there, that was important.”</p>
