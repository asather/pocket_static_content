<h1>NYSE warns GNC its shares could be delisted </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>New York Stock Exchange officials have warned GNC it is in danger of being delisted, a move that would strike another serious financial blow to the Pittsburgh-based health and wellness retailer.</p>
<p>The warning, dated April 22 and disclosed by the company on Tuesday, is based on two factors: GNC shares averaging below $1 at closing and its average market capitalization falling below $50 million over 30 trading days.</p>
<p>As of April 21, GNC’s average closing share price was 56 cents and its market capitalization was $47.3 million.</p>
<p>GNC has six months to become compliant but, in a release Tuesday, the company said, “No assurance can be given that the company will be able to regain compliance.”</p>
<p>The company also acknowledged the serious financial implications if its shares are suspended or delisted.</p>
<p>Should that happen, the GNC release said, “It would likely reduce the liquidity and market price of the shares; reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire the shares; negatively impact the company’s ability to access equity markets and obtain financing; and impair the company’s ability to attract and retain employees by means of equity compensation.”</p>
<p>GNC, whose shares were trading near $50 five years ago, saw its stock price fall precipitously in the 2015-2017 period, starting a downward trend that has slowed but never quite reversed.</p>
<p>The company did make notable moves to right its financial ship, rebranding itself as One New GNC in December 2016 and, after changing CEOs three times between 2014-2017, bringing stability to the c-suite with the appointment of current President and CEO Ken Martindale in September 2017.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Martindale’s leadership, GNC has expanded its global reach, partnering with Harbin Pharmaceutical Group which included a $300 million investment by the Chinese company, signing a master franchise agreement with Rapid Nutrition in Australia and, most recently, reaching a partnership with Brazilian retailer BFG Brasil Comercial de Vitaminas LTDA.</p>
<p>But online sales of vitamins and supplements by competitors, an excess of brick-and-mortar stores and mounting debt, have continued to weigh down the company.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, GNC announced it was temporarily furloughing “a significant portion” of its employees after negotiations to refinance some $600 million in debt fell through.</p>
