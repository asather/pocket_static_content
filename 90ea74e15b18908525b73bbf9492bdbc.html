<h1>Q&amp;A: ESPN analyst, former Pitt star Louis Riddick on virtual NFL draft coverage</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Louis Riddick will have a satellite truck parked outside his south New Jersey home this time next week. Yes, a satellite truck. Like the ones stationed outside stadiums on game day. ESPN isn’t taking any chances.</p>
<p>First-rounders won’t be ferried to a fountain stage in Vegas, but the NFL draft is still taking place, starting next Thursday. The yearly spectacle is pushing on virtually despite COVID-19, with coaches, general managers, even commissioner Roger Goodell operating from the comfort of their homes. And that means Riddick, a former Pitt star and NFL scout turned television analyst, needs crystal clear video connection.</p>
<p>Hence, the satellite truck.</p>
<p>“The alternative is you get a thunderstorm, your internet goes out, and I’m in the middle of talking about [Alabama wide receiver] Jerry Jeudy and boom, there goes the picture,” Riddick told the Post-Gazette on Thursday afternoon with a laugh. “Like, ‘Well, we’ve lost Louis.’ You can’t have that. That’s what has people freaking out. How do we make sure those things don’t happen?”</p>
<p>Connection issues or not, next weekend’s draft is going to be weird. Riddick acknowledged that, chatting on the phone from his home office, which has become his temporary TV studio. Five steps from his foyer staircase is where the former Philadelphia Eagles director of player personnel will dissect picks, break down film and perhaps provide an escape for a sports-deprived world.</p>
<p>All eyes will be on Riddick, host Trey Wingo and fellow analysts Mel Kiper Jr. and “Booger” McFarland as they head ESPN’s coverage of the quarantine’s biggest sports weekend. And Riddick, perhaps more than anyone on the virtual panel, understands how coronavirus has affected not only the telecast, but also the behind-the-scenes work done by NFL scouts and executives.</p>
<p>We talked with Riddick, a former Pitt captain and two-time Academic All-American, about his ties to the Panthers, how the NFL’s decision to still hold the draft could affect front offices and why the broadcast will be a “producing extravaganza.”</p>
<p><em>(This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Before we get into the draft stuff, what is life like for you right now? Working at home, I’m sure you’ve got your bookshelf backdrop all ready to go for next weekend.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yeah, it’s been cool. ESPN does a good job with their remote setup people, who literally drove all the way down here from Bristol to set up my office. They moved a few things around on my bookcase, brought lights, cameras, everything in here. That’s just the way it goes. ... But you know, in our line of work we crave structure and schedules and part of the juice is getting out and knowing you have to be somewhere and changing your scenery. That keeps you energized.</p>
<p>All of us are connecting with our families and with our priorities in ways that we never would have before. There is some benefit to it. But it’s challenging in many ways. I could easily go and shoot baskets with my son outside for two hours. I could sit down and play some “NBA 2K” for an hour. Because it’s all here at my disposal. You have to set a schedule where you’re getting your stuff done and remember that, hey, you are still getting paid to do a job. That’s one of the things I constantly remind myself of every morning.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Now, I noticed on the bookshelf you use as an on-air backdrop you’ve got a Pitt helmet. I’m guessing that was purposefully placed front and center?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> You know, that school, it’s funny. When you’re there, you’re just handling your business and trying to get to the pros and graduate and all that. But the longer you’re gone from it and as your life matures and evolves, you look back on some of your years in college as some of your best years and most formative. Then you develop real, adult relationships with the people at the school now. [Athletic director] Heather Lyke is someone who I have a ton of respect for. [Associate athletic director] EJ Borghetti is someone who I keep in contact with. They send me gear all the time. ... UPMC and the Pitt medical school, their work on this coronavirus vaccine, that gives you a sense of pride.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think two things are happening. One, because of everything that’s going on, people are re-evaluating and, two, realizing, [shoot], I’m getting older. I’m becoming an old man. I start looking at things a little different and valuing different things. I’ve always built relationships. But I’m proud of my school. There’s no question about that.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Obviously as researchers around the world work toward combating COVID-19, sports are canceled or postponed. But the NFL chose to move forward with the draft. From a “should they or shouldn’t they” perspective, what are your thoughts on that decision?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I’ve vacillated back and forth. The basic human instinct side of me says, we’re in a global fight for maintaining our way of life. There are some times that you say to yourself that you could give a [crap] about football right now. I’m worried about whether I can go to the grocery store, come home and not worry about five days later being admitted to an ICU. That’s real. ... So why are we doing stuff for football?</p>
<p>Then at the same time, if you sit around and think about that stuff all the time and that’s all you do is watch CNN or whatever channel you watch, it can start messing with you mentally. Then you need those distractions, those things you’re passionate about. If we’re not putting anyone in danger by what the NFL is doing, then I can understand their viewpoint, too, by saying, ‘We can still adjust. We can still get our business done.’ ... Plus, you have people hitting you up on social media saying, ‘You guys talking about the draft gives us something to look forward to. I would otherwise just sit around and worry about my life all the time.’ You go back and forth and have all those competing emotions.</p>
<p>How do I net out on this thing? I see more and more how much sports means to people. I don’t even want to say it’s an escape. I know I’m biased, but football in particular, in this country in particular, people really depend on it. And if you shut that down and took it away — if we stopped talking about football, no news, none, zero, zilch — I really wonder what that would do to people’s psyche. It’s like, where do we go now? Now what do we turn to? Because there’s nothing. So that gives you the impetus to say, look, it’s all right. Let’s do our job.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> And it’s interesting, too, because before you were at ESPN you were a scout and director of player personnel. How would you do that job now without having everyone’s verified medical records and hosting top-30 visits? I’m sure you still have friends in that part of the business. If you were in their shoes like you were 10 or so years ago, that’s got to be a totally different beast.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It does make it difficult because the two things you don’t want to screw up on with evaluations are character and medical. Those are two things that are no-nos in the scouting world. And at this point, you can’t really get that last bit of character evaluation that you typically rely on with one-on-one interactions. And you can’t get that last bit of medical information. The two things that can a lot of times cost you your job because they lead to a player not turning out the way you want, you can’t get access to. So that’s not reassuring.</p>
<p>But the good thing, if there’s a good thing, is that everyone’s dealing with the same thing. Owners know that. You’re still going to be held responsible and accountable for making the selections that you do and the signings that you do. That means you’re going to have to rely a little more on your scouting intellect and rely more on second-hand information and the relationships you build up.</p>
<p>You just hope that your scouting department has the right amount of experience and the right number of quality contacts and they really did their work from August to December before the all-star games started to get the pertinent background. Just so you’re not sitting there, scrambling and saying, ‘Damn, I don’t have anything on this guy.’ ... You’re going to get exposed if you have too much of that.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Now from a coverage perspective for you, we’re less than a week out from this thing. What are your expectations for how this will go?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Well, the information will flow a little bit differently. The juice is a little bit different because you don’t have the crowd screaming at these live venues like we’ve had the past couple of years. It’ll be harder to jump in and have that banter back and forth like [Jon] Gruden and Mel used to have. ... I’m going to be sitting in my office hundreds of miles away from Mel. Mel’s going to be in Baltimore, Booger’s going to be in Tampa, [NFL Network’s] Dan Jeremiah’s going to be in California, Trey’s going to be in Bristol. I don’t know how it’s going to flow.</p>
<p>Our producer, Bryan Ryder, is going to have to do a great job of directing the traffic a little bit more. Whereas before, it was like, “Trey, this is what we want to do and this is how we want to go. Louis, just play off of what Trey says. Louis, you take this highlight, and Mel you take the next one.” And Mel could look at me, and you have that eye contact. There’s none of that now. It’s going to be a producing extravaganza. The producers and the hosts, without a doubt, the most stress is going to be on them.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Now in the buildup to the draft, does this format affect your preparation at all? Is being at home actually helping you lock in on film?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> My prep is the same. I’m doing it where I’ve always done it, in this office. So that’s all the same. I mean, I would’ve went to more pro days this year, and I love that part of the job. But that hasn’t been an issue. I’m grinding like it’s any other year. I’m really focusing for myself on the top 200 guys, top 250. I’m actually circling back again and rewatching some guys just to be sure.</p>
<p>Because here’s the other thing. When you’re doing TV like this as opposed to being on a desk, on your desk on TV you’ll see a Microsoft Surface, and I have all kinds of information on there. On that desk, if Mel was on camera, it’s right there at my fingertips and I don’t have to be looking at the camera. I can pull up any information I want. You can’t really do that now. I need to have as much of the information committed to memory as possible. So the prep has maybe been a little more intense, just because of the way the show has to be shot.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are you going to have flash cards or something to get all this down?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> (laughs) I’ll have tables here. But it’ll be intense. It’ll be intense.</p>
<p>But one thing too, something you can’t lose in this environment is that people are going to want to be entertained. They don’t want to see people who are uptight and sweating this thing. And I think we have to find that right balance. I don’t think it’s about perfection. The draft is about the players and the picks, man. It isn’t about us.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are you expecting fans to gather and social distance outside Goodell’s house to boo him after every pick?</p>
<p>A: (laughs) That would be cool. You know, every year there’s some kind of crazy stuff that happens. It’s Tyreke Hill’s allegations hitting, it’s Laremy Tunsil in a damn bong mask. Who knows? There will be something.</p>
