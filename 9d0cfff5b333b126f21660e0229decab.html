<h1>WPIAL sticking with 'status quo' with new football conference alignment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The WPIAL officially unveiled its new set of football conference alignments for the 2020-21 cycle Monday, and for the most part, the league’s six-classification system will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>After initially presenting <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-football/2020/01/08/WPIAL-football-alignment-proposals-Amy-Scheuneman/stories/202001080163" target="_blank">two drastically different alignment proposals</a> in a “town hall” style meeting with school principals, athletic directors and coaches Jan. 8 at North Hills High School, the WPIAL asked its 119 football-playing member schools to inform the league which method each prefers. The WPIAL football steering committee met Thursday to make a final decision on the alignment, and the board of directors approved it Monday.</p>
<p>The verdict is in, and the answer is clear — the vast majority of schools wished to keep things “status quo,” and the WPIAL obliged.</p>
<p>“It was a lot of work,” said WPIAL associate executive director Amy Scheuneman. “I think a lot of people benefit from that work, so it’s time well-served.”</p>
<p>Under the “new” alignment, the WPIAL will still have six classifications and six postseason tournaments, and conferences will continue to be made up strictly by classifications and geography, when possible. Playoff spots will still be determined by conference games.</p>
<p>While the WPIAL has decided to stick with the status quo, there will still be some changes in this two-year cycle — most notably when it comes to non-conference games.</p>
<p>In the past, the WPIAL scheduled non-conference opponents at random and the games were spread out throughout the season. Under the new alignment, all non-conference games will be played at the beginning of the season and scheduled by the WPIAL based on geography and competitiveness. The league hopes this will help alleviate concerns expressed by some schools about traveling too far for non-conference matchups.</p>
<p>“I think the compromise we came up with will address their issues, because we have realigned those crossover games,” Scheuneman said. “So when you look at proposal No. 2, a lot of those matchups will still occur — it’s just how they qualify for the playoffs that may be different in that regard.”</p>
<p>The other proposal would have called for a “regional” approach to conference alignment, in which schools would be placed in conferences based on geography, while conferences would have teams from two and sometimes three different classifications. This would have required a power rankings system to determine playoff spots, in which teams would have received more points for wins against opponents from larger classifications.</p>
<p>The WPIAL issued a survey in October asking schools if they preferred the six-classification system or would rather go back to four classifications, and almost 60% of member schools said they preferred the current system. As for the two proposals issued on Jan. 8, 72.1% of schools voted for the proposal that keeps the “status quo,” making it the obvious choice for the league.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to promote football, and the way you promote it is to get people at the games,” Scheuneman said. “People aren’t going to drive two hours to go to a football game, but you might get someone who’s close to the border who is only 10 minutes away from the school they’re playing that can take that ride over.</p>
<p>“So in an effort to make that happen, that hopefully will spark some interest in football.”</p>
<p>Aside from non-conference scheduling, the other main difference that comes with the new alignment is the shift in teams to higher or lower classifications. As expected, Pine-Richland is dropping from Class 6A down to Class 5A, while South Fayette is moving up from Class 4A to Class 5A. Aliquippa, meanwhile, is being forced up from Class 3A to Class 4A, pending an appeal to the PIAA.</p>
<p>This raises some questions about how many teams will qualify for the postseason, especially in Class 5A. Last year, 16 out of 23 teams made the postseason in Class 5A. This year, there are only 18 teams in Class 5A, making it highly unlikely that 16 teams will qualify for the postseason.</p>
<p>Schedules for both conference and non-conference games will be released in the next few weeks.&nbsp;WPIAL executive director Tim O’Malley said the league won’t know how many teams will qualify for the playoffs — let alone which classifications will play their WPIAL championship games at Heinz Field — until February at the earliest, after the schedules have been unveiled.</p>
<p>“We don’t even know where we’re plugging into their tournament, and won’t know on a first-reading basis until Wednesday,” O’Malley said. “It’s going to be a while before we know when we’re playing, how many get in. ... The parameters for playoff qualification will be determined at a later date.”</p>
