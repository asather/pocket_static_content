<h1>Ex-comptroller at Steubenville Diocese admits to tax fraud, stealing $300k</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The former comptroller of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Steubenville, Ohio, pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court in Columbus to tax crimes and embezzlement.</p>
<p>David A. Franklin, 67, admitted to failing to pay the IRS payroll taxes withheld from diocesan employee paychecks, filing false tax returns and embezzling nearly $300,000 from the diocese from 2008 to 2017.</p>
<p>Mr. Franklin was the comptroller from 1985 through 2016.</p>
<p>In that role he was in charge of finances at the diocese as well as at two related institutions — the Office of Social Ministry and the Mount Calvary Cemetery Association. His duties included withholding federal income taxes, Social Security and Medicare taxes from paychecks and paying them over to the IRS.</p>
<p>He was also in charge of filing state tax returns for all three entities.</p>
<p>From 2004 through 2016, Mr. Franklin caused payroll taxes to be withheld from paychecks for the diocese and the Office of Social Ministry but did not pay the funds over to the IRS. From 2013 through 2016, he did the same thing with paychecks for the cemetery association.</p>
<p>As a result, the institutions had to pay the IRS $2.7 million in withheld payroll taxes and the employer portion of the employment taxes owed.</p>
<p>While Mr. Franklin was cheating the IRS, according to his plea, he also stole $299,500 from the entities by preparing fraudulent checks issued to himself.</p>
<p>In addition, he also filed false personal income tax returns for a tax loss of $33,672.</p>
<p>“The actions of David Franklin were egregious and caused significant financial harm to Catholic Diocese of Steubenville and the Mount Calvary Cemetery Association who entrusted him to provide sound accounting and financial reporting services, not to divert monies for his own personal use,” said Bryant Jackson, Special Agent in Charge of IRS-Criminal Investigation in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>The plea agreement requires Mr. Franklin to pay $299,500 in restitution to the diocese to replace what he stole.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Sarah D. Morrison could also order restitution for the tax loss, interest and penalties sustained by the diocese. Because of his actions, the the diocesan entities had to pay a total of nearly $1 million in interest and penalties to the IRS.</p>
