<h1>Dapper Dan honors: Pitt volleyball team is 'making a statement' nationally</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Chinaza Ndee can tell Pitt’s volleyball team is making its mark on both Panthers athletics and Pittsburgh at large because of the kids.</p>
<p>On Jan. 12, the team held its annual winter skills clinic for 10- to 18-year-olds interested in honing their volleyball skills with the city’s best talent. Ndee, a junior, said about 20 kids usually show up.</p>
<p>This year, however, Ndee said about 200 kids poured into Fitzgerald Field House to learn from a team that went 30-2 last season and swept the ACC. For those accomplishments, the Pitt volleyball team will be honored as&nbsp;Sportswomen of the Year at the&nbsp;<a href="https://one.bidpal.net/dapperdan20/welcome" target="_blank">84th Dapper Dan Dinner &amp; Sports Auction</a>.</p>
<p>“We’re so grateful for your support,” Ndee said, referring to both the honor and the city embracing her team. “The energy at our games, being able to see that we have regulars, people that we see every weekend. Seeing the same kids go through our camps, that kind of stuff is just priceless.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t do any of that stuff without the support of the city, so we’re just really, really grateful.”</p>
<p>This year’s dinner and auction will take place at 6 p.m. Feb. 10 at the Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh Downtown. The Pitt volleyball team will be honored alongside Steelers defensive end Cameron Heyward (Sportsman of the Year), Steelers coach Mike Tomlin (Dr. Freddie Fu Sports Leadership Award) and legendary broadcaster Bill Hillgrove (Lifetime Achievement Award).</p>
<p>This is the second year in a row that Pitt athletics earned Dapper Dan Sportswoman of the Year honors after athletic director Heather Lyke <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2019/01/25/Heather-Lyke-Dapper-Dan-Sportswoman-2018-pitt-athletic-director-pittsburgh/stories/201901270014" target="_blank">received the same award</a> for 2018.</p>
<p>“It’s an acknowledgement of what [Coach] Dan Fisher and the volleyball program are building at Pitt,” Lyke said. “There’s no question they are making a statement not just in the ACC, but nationally. It’s really nice for them to be acknowledged.”</p>
<p>During his seven years in Oakland, Fisher led Pitt to three ACC titles in the last three seasons and the highest NCAA tournament seed (No. 6 overall) in school history last season. He was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/01/02/pitt-womens-volleyball-ncaa-tournament-acc-championship/stories/202001020153" target="_blank">rewarded for his efforts</a> earlier this month with a seven-year contract extension.</p>
<p>Fisher commended his players for both their on-court accomplishments and how well they represent themselves in the community, including the fact they maintained a stellar combined GPA of 3.558 during the fall semester.</p>
<p>“One of the things that I’ve said the last two years is that it’s not only been a good run for us, but it’s been really neat to watch Pittsburgh get behind a women’s team,” Fisher said. “This is another thing that adds to that.”</p>
<p>None of the program’s success would have been possible without star players such as Ndee and Kayla Lund, a junior who, like Ndee, helped usher in this period of sustained excellence.</p>
<p>“It really speaks to what Fish has done here, what the whole coaching staff has done,” said Lund, the 2019 ACC Player of the Year. “Every year, he brings in really great players. Our job is to buy into what he’s preaching, the culture he’s created. It’s really hard to not buy in because you see how successful it is.“</p>
<p>She and Ndee both credited Lyke for giving their team the resources to succeed, the latest example being Pitt’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/01/14/Pitt-athletics-Heather-Lyke-reveals-Victory-Heights-facilities-plan/stories/202001140138" target="_blank">“Victory Heights” facilities plan</a>.&nbsp;More details on the initiative&nbsp;were announced earlier this month, and it includes a 3,500-seat arena for the volleyball, wrestling and gymnastics programs, as well as their own “state-of-the-art [practice] facility to recruit to and train in and compete in,” as Lyke put it.</p>

<p>As a veteran Dapper Dan honoree, Lyke fondly recalled hobnobbing at last year’s dinner and auction with Steelers legends such as Jerome Bettis and Bill Cowher. She hopes the volleyball team enjoys its Dapper Dan experience and said they represent the “comprehensive excellence” for which all Pitt athletic programs strive.</p>
<p>“We’re working hard to make all Pitt fans proud and the city of champions proud, too,” Lyke said. “We’re excited about the trajectory and growth and impact that has yet to come for Pitt athletics.”</p>
<p>Fisher said the team’s goal this year was “to be the greatest team in the history of Pitt women’s volleyball,” and he believes “you could make an argument we did that.” He definitely has a point, but that historic season ended in a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2019/12/07/Pitt-volleyball-s-season-ends-NCAA-Cincinnati/stories/201912070066" target="_blank">second-round NCAA tournament loss</a> to Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Though Lund was excited about the Sportswomen of the Year recognition, the rising senior is focused on ending her Pitt volleyball career on a high note.</p>
<p>“We just ask that you continue to give us your support and continue to come to games,” she said. “Because our stories aren’t even near to being finished.”</p>
