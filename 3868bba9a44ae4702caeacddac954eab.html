<h1>No time like now to celebrate 50th anniversary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Fran and Richard Hensel of West Deer Township celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary Saturday. They were going to do a cruise to the Rhine to celebrate, which of course got postponed. Knowing the couple was disappointed, their family celebrated with a social distancing surprise parade.</p>
<p>Fran's brother, Peter Ferraro, of Ross Township, understands how disappointing it can be to not have the 50th anniversary you wanted. "We couldn't do it in the same fashion we wanted to either," said Ferraro. He had big plans to celebrate with his wife when she was diagnosed with cancer. They celebrated at Ricco's in the North Hills before she passed in 2017. When his niece came up with the idea for a new way for Fran and Richard to celebrate, he was all in.</p>
<p>They decorated about a dozen cars with balloons, placards, streamers and rode past their home blowing horns and playing loud music. Fran and Richard grew up together in Sharpsburg. Richard came back from Vietnam and the two reconnected at Ferraro's wedding. They wed in 1970. They had one son, Jason, who is a Sgt. in the North Strabane police department.</p>
