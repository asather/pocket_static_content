<h1>How the Pirates' pitching plan will change under Oscar Marin</h1>

<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Joe Musgrove led the Pirates’ pitching staff last year in starts, innings pitched and strikeouts. He was, for lack of a better term, their de facto ace.</p>
<p>This offseason, Musgrove has spoken repeatedly about taking more of a leadership role, and he already carries with him a reputation for being super competitive, a legitimate athlete who’s more than just a pitcher.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">But for much of last season, Musgrove was a couple other things, especially as they related to integrating technology into the Pirates’ pitching program via Rapsodo and TrackMan, a pair of data gathering/analyzing tools. The 27-year-old right-hander was both confused and intimidated when it came to the abundance of information he was being asked to process.</span></p>
<p>“I’m not afraid to say that I’m not very well-educated on it,” Musgrove told the Post-Gazette on Monday at Pirate City as most pitchers and catchers reported for spring training. “I’m not exactly sure what the numbers all mean and what you’re trying to get out of them.”</p>
<p>Which is why, Musgrove said, he can’t wait for one of Oscar Marin’s first official meetings of the season, when the Pirates’ new pitching coach has promised to explain both systems in detail, setting the stage for what should be more of a data-driven approach.</p>
<p>What Marin plans on doing is not terribly new — the Pirates did their best to integrate more technology last season, too — but it could wind up having a profound impact if the Pirates are able to finally modernize their pitching program.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I think he can add a lot,” Chad Kuhl said of Marin. “It’s nice to have someone who’s very analytically inclined. I think he knows a lot about that sort of thing. It’s nice to work with him and with a lot of the new-age stuff that we were missing out on.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Just to be able to go over some of that stuff — Rapsodo and TrackMan — I think that’s going to be big for us.”</span></p>
<p>TrackMan and Rapsodo, as you probably know by now, are everywhere around baseball. Their primary function is to capture velocity, movement, spin rate and all kinds of fancy stuff. The Pirates employed both last season, too, although it seems like there was something of a breakdown in their implementation.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Analysts tracked and gathered data. They supplied it to coaches, too. But at that point, without pointing any fingers, there was obviously a breakdown somewhere where the information was never properly implemented.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Last year, it seemed like we were trying to go in an analytical route with the Rapsodo and the numbers and the information that was made available to us,” Musgrove said. “But some of it was getting lost in translation from the analytical guys to the players.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Having a pitching coach that we spend every day with and we talk with and see and communicate with regularly, him being educated in that department is huge for us. Now we have multiple lines of communication, and we have constant feedback.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Musgrove learned first-hand how important nerding out with pitching preparation can be. Over his last “four or five starts,” Musgrove took it upon himself to take a deeper dive into the numbers. Maybe against one hitter he’s more likely to have success with a slider away, while with another, in a different count, that guy might not react well to a four-seamer inside.</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Musgrove started learning about spin efficiency, spin axis and which pitches and locations offered the best chance of producing desirable outcomes. Instead of pitching and reacting to hitters, Musgrove turned into a little more of a card counter.</p>
<p>“The time I’ve spent in the big leagues, I’ve never really been big on looking at the Rapsodo and trying to get my spin efficiency and the axis and all that right,” said Musgrove, who went 3-0 in his final five starts with a 2.89 ERA and 32 strikeouts against just five walks. “I just know what a good fastball looks like and what a good fastball feels like. I’m not trying to turn myself into a robot or a machine, but I’m also trying to be a little smarter with how I’m working, trying to make my job a little easier.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">How the Pirates’ pitchers function under Marin won’t be solely about using machines, either. In <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/02/10/pittsburgh-pirates-spring-training-chris-archer-houston-astros-cheating/stories/202002100102" target="_blank">his session with the media</a> on Monday, Chris Archer referenced Marin’s extensive background in biomechanics, where Marin has been able to break down not only pitch usage, but also how those delivering those pitches use their body in space.</span></p>
<p>“I’ve already had conversations with Oscar that I never had with other teams that I’ve been on,” Archer said, later adding, “He has an old-school mind but a new-school brain.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Marin’s brain and how he thinks about things should offer another difference for this group, as it looks to lower its ERA from the 5.18 it produced a season ago, which is among the worst marks in franchise history.</span></p>
<p>While Marin doesn’t plan on accepting substandard work, he also actively tries to avoid harping on negative stuff, preferring instead to accentuate the positives.</p>
<p>“If you’re doing something well, you should do more of it,” Marin said late last month. “That’s something I truly believe in. There is room for improvements with some things, but those are things that we’re going to figure out together as we go along.”</p>
<p>That sort of stance will resonate with pitchers, who probably don’t want the new guy tearing them down before the two sides get to know each other, even if the new guy might be right about a few things.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Keone Kela has known Marin longer than anybody in the Pirates’ clubhouse, dating back to their time together with the Texas Rangers. Kela described Marin as brutally honest but also crazy smart when it comes to preparing a staff to pitch in 2020.</span></p>
<p>“We’re going to continue to develop collectively and use analytics to help us progress with who we are as pitchers,” Kela said. “We want to be able to figure out what works and what doesn’t work. We want to improve our pitch-planning.</p>
<p>“One thing I love about Oscar is that he never takes away the measure of heart. He’ll allow us to feel confident to throw our best [stuff] even if it’s also the hitter’s strength. He gives us the confidence to throw our best stuff but with conviction.”</p>
