<h1>Steel Valley-Serra Catholic football game postponed</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The WPIAL football game between Steel Valley and Serra Catholic set for Friday night has been postponed due to a COVID-19 case.</p>
<p>The game was scheduled to be played at Serra, and Serra athletic director Bill Cleary confirmed the postponement Thursday. But he declined to elaborate, saying the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh would be making a statement. Serra, a private school in McKeesport, announced <a href="https://www.serrahs.org/" target="_blank">on its website</a> that school is closed Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>Cleary said a makeup date has not been established for the football game. The game was the season opener for both teams and is a Class 2A Allegheny Conference contest. The WPIAL is urging schools to make up postponed conference games.</p>
<p>The Steel Valley-Serra Catholic game is the sixth WPIAL contest to be postponed Friday because of COVID-19.</p>
