<h1>Police believe Indiana County man, 21, shot own baby by accident</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A 21-year-old father shot his own baby by accident last week inside an Indiana County home, police said Monday.</p>
<p>“Troopers do not have any reason to believe that this was an intentional discharge of the firearm,” a Pennsylvania State Police news release said.</p>
<p>The shooting, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/02/01/infant-baby-shot-white-township-indiana-county-pennsylvania/stories/202002010066" target="_blank">which wounded a 4-month-old boy</a>, happened around 6:16 p.m. Saturday inside an apartment on College Lodge Road in White Township.</p>
<p>Police said the only people home at the time were the child and his parents.</p>
<p>“Troopers believe that the father, while inside the&nbsp;apartment, fired a single round from a 9mm handgun. The round struck the child, resulting in&nbsp;significant injuries to the child,” police said.</p>
<p>The boy was shot in the upper body. He was in stable condition at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Police said when the investigation is done, the results will be turned over to the Indiana County District Attorney’s Office.</p>
<p>“It’s possible that some criminal charges might be filed,” Trooper Cliff Greenfield said, declining to elaborate.</p>
<p>The trooper said that as far as he was aware, the gun was legally possessed.</p>
<p>When the shooting occurred, the child’s parents immediately alerted a neighbor, who called 911.</p>
<p>“We have a good idea of how it happened,” Trooper Greenfield said, but he declined to provide details, saying there was more to investigate.</p>
