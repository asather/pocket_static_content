<h1>Local projects win historic preservation awards</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Five state historic preservation awards announced Monday will go to local projects, including a reconstructed park fountain, a former Carnegie Library-turned-museum and a 19th-century electric shop, all on the North Side.&nbsp; In September, Preservation Pennsylvania will honor 24 individuals or organizations during a statewide conference in Easton, Pa.</p>
<p>A winner in the category of small residential project was the conversion of a two-story brick building on Beech Avenue known as the Electric Shop because its former owners stored electrical equipment in the auxiliary building. The home’s renovation was designed by architect Christine Brill, co-founder of the Studio for Spatial Practice.</p>
<p>In the construction project category, winners included Strada Architecture for its work on the former Salvation Army building Downtown that became the Distrikt Hotel, and&nbsp;MuseumLab, a project of the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh in the former Carnegie Library of Allegheny. Architect Julie Eizenberg of Koning Eizenberg turned the Richardsonian Romanesque landmark on the North Side into a place where tweens and teenagers can create art, learn about technology and work in maker spaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A preservation planning award went to North Side leaders of&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/brian-oneill/2019/05/06/Brian-O-Neill-Allegheny-Commons-Park-fountain-North-Side-Pittsburgh-Dan-Onorato-Patricia-Rooney/stories/201905060016" target="_blank">community effort to recreate the historic fountain</a> that again stands in the northeast quadrant of Allegheny Commons. Also honored was a&nbsp;former City of Pittsburgh public works building that became an exhibit staging area at Phipps Conservatory &amp; Botanical Gardens in Oakland. The building, which opened in 2019, is on a remediated brownfield and is heated and cooled by geothermal wells. A lagoon next to it stores rainwater. The project was overseen by Jeffrey Davis of FortyEighty Architecture. The project will receive an initiative award for sustainability in historic preservation.</p>
<p>Other awards include the Historic Gettysburg Adams County Barn Preservation Project and Grant Program, which will receive the Henry A. Jordan Award for its efforts to preserve 356 of an estimated 1,500 historic barns in the county.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A preservation award in the category of small residential project will go to Beth Gunnion and her husband, Vernon, who spent seven years restoring the Catharine Barge Tavern in Strasburg, Lancaster County. The female tavern keeper&nbsp;catered mostly to German immigrants when she opened the&nbsp;two-story log building in the 1780s. The contractor on the project was Museum Quality Building Restoration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preservation Pittsburgh, a statewide nonprofit, has recognized outstanding historic preservation since 1979. The awards will be given out Sept. 16 at the Simon Silk Mill in Easton, Pa, as part of a heritage conference on Sept. 16-18.&nbsp;</p>
