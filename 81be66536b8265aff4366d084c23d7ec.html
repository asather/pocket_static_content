<h1>Troy Polamalu talks Antonio Brown, Hall of Fame voting and Steelers' growth on defense</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Troy Polamalu is balancing his hopes for Pro Football Hall of Fame this weekend with concern for an ex-teammate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former Steelers safety made a rare appearance on Radio Row, <a href="https://twitter.com/usatodaysports/status/1223248671170412545" target="_blank">speaking with USA Today Sports</a> at the Super Bowl on Friday, and touched on an array of topics. Among them was Antonio Brown, who turned himself into Florida police earlier this month on chargers burglary with battery, burglary of an unoccupied conveyance and criminal mischief&nbsp;and has exhibited increasingly erratic behavior over the past year.</p>
<p>Polamalu said he’s reached out to Brown to let him know that he and other former teammates&nbsp;“love him” and are genuine in offering him their help. He also expressed hope that Brown’s situation will improve eventually.</p>
<p>“I feel bad for him because it’s tough, especially for people in that situation that he’s coming up from,” Polamalu said. “I mean, he had nothing in his life. He grew up here in Miami, couldn’t trust anybody. You get to the league where they just want to use you for your talents and not necessarily for who he is. And it’s hard to find trust in anybody given in that position. But I definitely hope the best for him. And he’s overcome so much in his life. This is, to me, I feel it’s just another hurdle that he’ll overcome as well.”</p>
<p>Polamalu is in Miami as a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s Class of 2020. The class will be announced Saturday night and could potentially include former&nbsp;teammate Alan Faneca as well.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old predictably took the humble round when explaining what it would mean to be immortalized in what is just his first year of eligibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s a tremendous honor for me,” he said.&nbsp;“I think about my teammates, and that’s honestly the first thing that I think about. I definitely feel unworthy of any sort of recognition because I grew up watching the Ronnie Lotts and even played as a contemporary with Ed Reed, Rodney Harrison and a lot of these players who either are in the Hall of Fame or not in the Hall of Fame, so it’s always hard for me to sit there and think that I’m deserving of something like this.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polamalu did not leave the Steelers on the best of terms, as the terms of his retirement strained the relationship. He has not been around the team much for events or Super Bowl reunions; he won two titles with the team after the 2005 and 2008 seasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has, however, been heartened by the resurgence of the Steelers defense after some struggles following his retirement in 2015.</p>
<p>“I’ll definitely always make the argument that the Steeler organization is not only built through the locker room, but built through the defense,” he said.&nbsp;“No Steeler team can ever win a Super Bowl without having a great defense, let alone any team for the most part. But it was really great to see the defense come through the latter part of the season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“And I really think that they’ve gone through a lot of cultural changes internally as well, and I think that’s really great for them. And I think the team leadership has really stepped up. I know coaching gets a lot of credit, but the coaches have been the same for the last few years. I think the leadership internally with the locker room is what’s really changed the dynamic of the organization.”</p>
