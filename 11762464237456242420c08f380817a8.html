<h1>Remembering a visionary: Joan Apt helped build Pittsburgh’s cultural scene</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Thanks to a number of visionaries among us, Pittsburgh has become a center of arts and culture over the past 50 years.</p>
<p>One of those visionaries, Joan Apt, the co-founder of Pittsburgh Public Theater, died last week at age 93.</p>
<p>Five decades ago our city did not stand out for the performing arts. The Cultural District did not exist. That area was largely composed of rundown buildings occupied by bars and massage parlors, Pittsburgh’s “red light district.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre was in its infancy and not nationally recognized. The Pittsburgh Symphony performed in Oakland at a Shriners hall. The Benedum Center was a movie theater.</p>
<p>Along came Ms. Apt, the granddaughter of industrialist Isaac Frank and a lover of the arts from a young age. Having a resident professional theater company in town was a goal that she and her co-founder, Margaret Rieck, were driven to accomplish.</p>
<p>Ms. Apt was a determined fundraiser who didn’t take no for an answer. She and her co-founder raised $370,000 in 1975 — $1.8 million in today’s dollars — to launch the company. The Public Theater opened with Tennessee Williams’ “The Glass Menagerie” at the Allegheny Theater (now the New Hazlett Theater) on the North Side. She stayed active as a board member and patron through 45 seasons.</p>
<p>In addition, prior to her theater work, she was active with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra as it planned its move to the newly renovated Heinz Hall. In 1971-72, she planned the successful subscription campaign for the move downtown.</p>
<p>Nonprofit arts organizations do not succeed on artistic merit alone. They require generous patrons and skilled board members who oversee the business aspects of the organizations.</p>
<p>They require champions, who work tirelessly for the cause with no self-interest in mind.</p>
<p>The arts found one of their greatest champions in Ms. Apt.</p>
