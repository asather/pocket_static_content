<h1>Range Resources pleads no contest to criminal charges after investigation of Washington County wells</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Range Resources, one of the largest shale gas drillers in the state, has pleaded no contest to criminal charges of negligent oversight of two well sites in Washington County.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced the pleading Friday, which comes as the result of a two-year state criminal grand jury investigation into environmental crimes committed by shale gas drilling companies across the state.</p>
<p>The grand jury’s investigation found Range “knowingly covered up” leaking problems at a drilling waste pit and a 3 million-gallon hydraulic fracturing fluid flowback impoundment at its Yeager well pad in Amwell Township, Washington County.</p>
<p>And at the Brownlee drilling site in Buffalo Township, Washington County, a wastewater storage tank leak breached a “poorly secured” containment liner and flowed onto neighboring property and into Buffalo Creek. The leak contaminated a small farm field and its cleanup required the removal of approximately 100 trees and 12,000 square feet of soil.</p>
<p>“In Pennsylvania, clean air and pure water is a constitutional right, yet too often frackers from across the country come to our Commonwealth, walk into our communities, and―sometimes without care or consequence―strip us of those basic rights,” said Mr. Shapiro in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ilbiqyzeyzmyaoy/Official%20Range%20Resources%20Announcement%20%7C%20Attorney%20General%20Josh%20Shapiro.mp4?dl=0" target="_blank">video announcement of the charges and pleading</a>.</p>
<p>“Backed by big investors and big influence, too many fracking companies act like they’re above the law, and put themselves ahead of the people who work on the job site, as well as the farmer, neighbor, and children impacted by their operations. We’re here to remind these fracking companies that the people of Pennsylvania come first.”</p>
<p>Range pleaded no contest in Washington County Court of Common Pleas for the Brownlee drilling site to one count of disposal, processing and storage of residual waste, one count of unlawful conduct under the Solid Waste Management Act, and one count of prohibition against discharge of industrial wastes.</p>
<p>At the Yeager Pad, the no contest pleas were on two counts of disposal, processing and storage of residual waste and two counts of unlawful conduct under the Solid Waste Management Act.</p>
<p>As part of the Brownlee site plea, Range will pay a $6,000 fine to the Solid Waste Abatement Fund, $3,000 to the Clean Water Fund, and a $16,000 charitable contribution to the Washington County Watershed Alliance.</p>
<p>For the Yeager plea, Range will pay a fine in the amount of $41,000 to the Solid Waste Abatement Fund, and an $84,000 charitable contribution to the Washington County Watershed Alliance.</p>
<p>“Today, Range Resources has answered for their actions, and they know what they’ve done as indicated by internal documents and their own plea,” Mr. Shapiro said. “But this is just the beginning. We are in the first stages of a long process to hold the well-connected accountable and meet the promise of our constitution to protect our environment for generations to come. That’s why we’re here today, and why my office will uphold our Commonwealth’s environmental laws until we meet the promise of our Constitution.”</p>
