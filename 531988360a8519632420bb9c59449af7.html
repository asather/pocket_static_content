<h1>Pitt postgame silence leaves Pat Narduzzi ... encouraged?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For Pat Narduzzi, silence was golden.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/10/03/n-c-state-pitt-football-recap-acc-pat-narduzzi/stories/202010030084" target="_blank">After losing to N.C. State</a>, a 14-point underdog, last Saturday, Pitt’s players were quiet in the Heinz Field locker room. They were mum, too, on Sunday night at Pitt’s South Side facility while rewatching the debacle at their routine film session.</p>
<p>Pitt’s players saw their heralded defense collapse on N.C. State’s final drive. They saw an unmitigated disaster at the 1-yard line early in the third quarter. And they saw 13 penalties pile up. Speechless, the Panthers took it all in as they watched their undefeated record and national ranking disappear -— which&nbsp;proved something to the guy tasked with preparing Pitt for its next game, a road test at Boston College.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I’ve ever been in a team meeting where they were as quiet, which tells me it hurts,” Narduzzi said Monday. “I really think it hit our kids in the stomach. Like, what just happened? And sometimes you need a wake-up call to figure out what’s real, what’s fake and who do you listen to. Sometimes you listen to the outside noise, and it can affect you. But I think our guys learned.</p>
<p>“So I like where we are after that loss. If a loss can be good for you, I think it’s going to be good for us. We’ll see how we respond. That’s going to be the key this week in practice. And from our history, we always respond. So that’s what I expect.”</p>
<p>Of course, the Panthers don’t <em>always</em> respond positively after a defeat. Pitt’s record following a loss is 14-12 under Narduzzi. If Notre Dame is included as a partial member, the Panthers have lost back-to-back ACC games six times since 2015.</p>
<p>By the same token, some of Narduzzi’s best wins have followed defeats. The Panthers’ 2016 upset win at Clemson came on the back of a 23-point loss to Miami. Pitt’s improbable 2017 win over the Hurricanes happened a week after an uninspiring loss to Virginia Tech. And last year, the “Pitt Special” takedown of Central Florida came seven days after a gutting afternoon in State College.</p>
<p>Pitt’s record after a loss last year was actually 4-1, the best of any year during Narduzzi’s tenure.</p>
<p>Pitt fans will remember the Panthers following up their shutout loss at Virginia Tech with a dud against Boston College to close the regular season. But Narduzzi doesn’t think a flat loss like that will happen again this weekend, as he lauded Pitt’s leadership and complimented its muted but “[ticked] off” attitude during Sunday’s film session.</p>
<p>“I get mad when they don’t get mad,” Narduzzi said. “... I mean, I’ve walked into team meetings after getting beat by 20 and the guys are all laughing. Like, do you know what happened less than 24 hours ago? That’s the age we’re in. Kids let things go quickly.</p>
<p>“But our kids were locked in (on Sunday). They understand the kind of sacrifices they’ve made this year with the pandemic. Like, we’re doing all this, and we can’t go out and play like that. It comes down to having your mind right, and obviously I didn’t do a great job of getting them mentally prepared to come in and play that football game. Sometimes you have to learn by fire, and I think that’s what happened.”</p>
<p><strong>ACC nod</strong></p>
<p>Even in defeat, DJ Turner’s performance was too good to ignore.</p>
<p>Turner was named the ACC’s co-wide receiver of the week after catching eight passes for 186 yards in Pitt’s loss to the Wolfpack. Fittingly, Turner earned the honor alongside N.C. State’s Emeka Emezie, who bodied Pitt’s secondary for 102 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>N.C. State’s Devin Leary was also named the ACC quarterback of the week after picking apart the Panthers to the tune of 336 yards and four touchdowns.</p>
<p>Turner’s day was a historic one, though. His 186 yards were the most by a Panther since Greg Lee’s 188 in a game at Syracuse back on Nov. 6, 2004 — pretty impressive for a player who transferred in from Maryland less than two months ago.</p>
<p><strong>Game time announced</strong></p>
<p>Pitt’s game at Miami next week will kick at noon and air on either ABC or the ACC Network, the conference announced Monday.</p>
<p>If it’s televised on the ACC Network, it will be Pitt’s sixth consecutive contest on the ESPN-affiliated network. Television information will be finalized after this weekend’s slate of games.</p>
