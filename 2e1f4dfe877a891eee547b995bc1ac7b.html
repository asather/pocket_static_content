<h1>Plan for new fitness center at Pitt moves forward</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A plan for a new fitness, health and recreation center at the University of Pittsburgh advanced Thursday as a trustees committee authorized demolition of the existing Learning Research and Development Center building and O’Hara parking garage on the Oakland campus.</p>
<p>The board of trustees’ property and facilities committee unanimously approved the project <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#search/Zwick/WhctKJVjXpwBMQZDnpVlpSrmjjjvpHDjkCTlwRjMMZXbxlLrvdDvPnzBJtGZSCFwFMTQlPQ?projector=1&amp;messagePartId=0.1" target="_blank">during a meeting that also saw authorization of renovations</a> to both the ground floor of the Cathedral of Learning and the third floor of the Biomedical Sciences Tower.</p>
<p>The new fitness center for students, faculty and staff is is slated to open in 2022 and is intended to link the upper and lower campuses in Oakland, officials said. It is expected to have 300,000 square feet.</p>
<p>“Our vision is to create a cutting-edge, centrally located wellness and recreation space,” said Kenyon Bonner, vice provost and dean of students, said in April when the planned building was announced.</p>
<p>Pitt has hired&nbsp;architect Moody Nolan to design the center. Construction is slated to begin in spring 2020. The work is part of Pitt’s campus master plan released in late 2018.</p>
<p>As campus development in recent decades has spread north of Fifth Avenue, including such projects as the Petersen Events Center, residence halls and other athletic facilities, Pitt officials have looked for ways to connect students who must traverse hills to reach destinations.</p>
<p>The committee has delegated authority from Pitt’s full board to approve certain construction and renovation projects. The full board meets Friday.&nbsp;</p>
