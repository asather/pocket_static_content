<h1>How MLB’s three-batter rule could impact the Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — The three-batter minimum that will go into effect on Thursday was designed by Major League Baseball to speed up games. No longer will there be a parade of pitching changes in the later innings, basically eliminating the term LOOGY (left-handed, one-out guy) from the baseball vernacular.</p>
<p>The loss of the LOOGY shouldn’t impact the Pirates too much given the limited left-handed options they currently have in their bullpen — they could conceivably begin 2020 with all righties — but there will be an interesting chain reaction as a result of the rule.</p>
<p>“The rule is going to change how people build their lineups and how managers manage their bullpen with right-left splits,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “There are a lot factors that come into play.”</p>
<p>What are some of those factors? Let’s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>‘Real pitchers’ needed</strong></p>
<p>The most obvious factor here is bullpen construction. Because relievers now must pitch to three batters — unless there’s an injury/illness or they finish an inning — guys like Jesse Orosco, a LOOGY until he retired at age 46, are obsolete.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, again, the bullpen-construction angle won’t have a huge impact. With Derek Holland tracking toward a rotation spot and Steven Brault injured, Robbie Erlin and Sam Howard are their two most experienced bullpen options.</p>
<p>Lefties have a .291 batting average and .757 OPS against Erlin lifetime and marks of .243/.754 against Howard. Their overall performance this spring — not great — is much more important than their ability (or lack thereof) to get lefties out.</p>
<p>One interesting thing to watch might be the usage of Richard Rodriguez. While he’s previously been deployed as a fireman — entering the game with runners on base and counted upon to escape the jam — Rodriguez actually has some interesting reverse splits.</p>
<p>For his career, lefties have hit just .216 with a .653 OPS against Rodriguez compared to .268/.766 for right-handed hitters.</p>
<p>Rodriguez and Michael Feliz both stranded 85.2 percent of baserunners in 2019. Only 13 throughout MLB fared better. Those factors, plus Rodriguez having a solid history against lefties, could further increase the need for Feliz to take a step forward this season.</p>
<p>It would also allow Edgar Santana — who has not yet allowed a baserunner this spring — to pitch the seventh inning when the Pirates have a lead, serving as a bridge to Kyle Crick and Keone Kela at the back end.</p>
<p>But the most basic takeaway here is this: Everybody in your bullpen must be able to get multiple hitters out.</p>
<p>“It is going to separate individuals and show who really has good stuff,” Kela said. “When you can’t lean on a specialist role, we’re going to find out if you’re a real pitcher.”</p>
<p><strong>Walk this way</strong></p>
<p>Look for walks to increase around baseball, especially intentional walks. According to ESPN research, 753 intentional walks were issued in 2019, which is the fewest in a season since 1961. The Pirates accounted for 22 of those, the third-lowest total in the National League.</p>
<p>But with the new rule, it could make sense for the Pirates and other teams to simply put a guy on base as opposed to trying to survive a matchup where the odds are stacked against them.</p>
<p>One example of this could come against the Cubs, who often have Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo and Javier Baez occupying successive spots in the order.</p>
<p>Rizzo is a lefty who hits righties especially well (.962 OPS compared to .806 against left-handed pitchers). If the Pirates have a right-handed reliever on the mound, it simply might make more sense for Pittsburgh to pass on facing Rizzo.</p>
<p>“It will be interesting to see how that works out with the pitcher,” Shelton said. “It’s just one of those things we're going to toy with. It may be different in how we create our roster, but going forward, I think it's going to be a little fluid.”</p>
<p>Managers could also look to walk more batters intentionally in the middle of an at-bat to manipulate the rule. Whoever throws the final pitch of the at-bat gets credit for facing that hitter, so Shelton could conceivably “waste” one of his pitchers’ three batters by making a move mid-count.</p>
<p>Mid-at-bat pitching changes have always been rare; there were 45 in 2019, according to ESPN research. The reason is that they’re usually hated by pitchers or seen as a manager trying to show up one of his pitchers, but if this version of that creates an advantage, chances are it will be embraced.</p>
<p><strong>Offensive impact</strong></p>
<p>The rule will also impact how Shelton and his cohorts construct their lineups, likely clumping lefties and righties together to avoid this scenario. It could also change how Shelton deploys his bench players, especially considering that four of the possible five have pretty drastic splits.</p>
<p>What does that realistically mean for the Pirates? Here’s one example.</p>
<p>Shelton the other day trotted out a lineup that looked like a potential season-starter with Kevin Newman, Bryan Reynolds, Adam Frazier, Josh Bell, Gregory Polanco, Colin Moran, Jarrod Dyson and Jacob Stallings occupying spots one through eight.</p>
<p>The issue there involves the cluster of lefties after Bell. Polanco (.219/.638), Moran (.236/.630) and Dyson (.233/.586) do not have very good career numbers against left-handed pitching, but there’s little the Pirates can do.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make sense to drop Newman — who led all major league players with a .328 average from the leadoff spot (minimum: 75 games) — down to No. 6 just for that reason, while you’d probably prefer Polanco over Frazier (.671 vs. lefties) in the five-hole protecting Bell.</p>
<p>Having three consecutive lefties there could mean an entry point for Guillermo Heredia pinch-hitting and taking over in center field for Dyson if it’s a lefty in a key situation, as Heredia’s OPS is 141 points higher against southpaws (.737 vs. .596).</p>
<p>As far as other bench guys, Shelton could potentially use Jose Osuna against right-handed pitchers and Erik Gonzalez vs. lefties. In 2019, Osuna hit .284 with an .849 OPS against righties and was at .228/.613 vs. lefties.&nbsp;Gonzalez, meanwhile, saw more success against lefties (.333/.735) than righties (.213/.559) in 2019.</p>
<p>“It's going to adjust how you build your lineup, and I think some people that felt strongly about going back and forth now may re-evaluate that,” Shelton said. “It’s something we'll continue to talk about, and we'll talk about with our group and scouts, probably with the players a little bit.”</p>
