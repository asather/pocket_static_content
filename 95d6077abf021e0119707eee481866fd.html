<h1>Trump declines to say whether he will accept election results, claims many COVID-19 cases are 'sniffles'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>President Donald Trump declined to say whether he will accept the results of the November election, claiming without evidence that mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic could “rig” the outcome.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging interview with “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace, the president also continued to play down the severity of the coronavirus crisis in the country, declined to say whether he is offended by the Confederate flag, and dismissed polls showing him trailing former Vice President Joe Biden by a significant margin.</p>

<p>The interview comes as the 2020 campaign has been upended by the pandemic, which has claimed more than 137,000 lives in the United States. Most in-person events have been canceled, and both political parties are planning to hold smaller-scale conventions to limit the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Several states switched to primarily vote-by-mail primaries earlier this year, and the U.S. Postal Service is bracing for an onslaught of mail-in ballots this fall as states and cities seek alternatives to in-person voting.</p>
<p>In the “Fox News Sunday” interview, Mr. Wallace asked Mr. Trump whether he considers himself a “gracious” loser.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump replied that he doesn’t like to lose, then added: “It depends. I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.”&nbsp;Mr. Trump’s comment echoed unfounded claims he has made in recent weeks that mail-in voting is susceptible to widespread fraud.</p>
<p>“Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?” Mr. Wallace asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump responded, “No. I have to see.”</p>
<p>Later in the interview, pressed on whether he will accept the results of the November election, the president again declined to say.</p>
<p>“I have to see,” he said. “Look, you — I have to see. No, I’m not going to just say ‘yes’; I’m not going to say ‘no.’ And I didn’t last time, either.”</p>
<p>During the final presidential debate of the 2016 campaign — which was moderated by Mr. Wallace — Mr. Trump similarly suggested that he might consider the November election results illegitimate because the process, he claims, is rigged.</p>
<p>“I will keep you in suspense,” Mr. Trump said at the time. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton described that answer as “horrifying,” saying Mr. Trump was “talking down our democracy.”</p>
<p>Elections officials are anticipating a high turnout in November, along with a dramatic increase in voters who choose to mail their ballots instead of risking exposure to the coronavirus at polling places.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s campaign responded to Mr. Trump’s remarks in a statement Sunday morning. “The American people will decide this election,” Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said. “And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on “Fox News Sunday,” Mr. Trump played down the recent spike in U.S. coronavirus cases, arguing that “many of those cases shouldn’t even be cases.”</p>
<p>“Many of those cases are young people that would heal in a day,” he claimed. “They have the sniffles, and we put it down as a test.”</p>
<p>The U.S. tops the global death toll list with over 140,000 and confirmed infections, with 3.7 million. More than 20 states are reporting seven-day averages in coronavirus-related deaths higher than at the end of June, underscoring the turnaround since May and June, when deaths declined nationally.</p>
<p>Mr. Wallace pressed Mr. Trump on the issue, noting that there are about 6,000 current cases in the entire European Union. “Is it possible that they don’t have the virus as badly as we do?” he asked.</p>
<p>“It’s possible that they don’t test, that’s what’s possible,” Mr. Trump replied. “We find cases, and many of those cases heal automatically.”</p>
<p>The president also defended his oft-made prediction that the virus will simply “disappear” one day.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right eventually,” he said. “I will be right eventually. You know I said, ‘It’s going to disappear.’ I’ll say it again. ... It’s going to disappear, and I’ll be right.”</p>
<p>On the issue of the Confederate flag, a symbol that for many represents the country’s racist past and history of slavery, the president declined to offer his own feelings.</p>
<p>“It depends on who you’re talking about, when you’re talking about. ... When people proudly have their Confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism,” Mr. Trump said when asked whether the flag is offensive. “They love their flag. It represents the South.”</p>
<p>Amid a nationwide debate over Confederate monuments and symbols, Mr. Trump has previously said he views the flag a matter of freedom of speech. He went further in the “Fox News Sunday” interview, appearing to equate the flying of the Confederate flag to the Black Lives Matter movement against systemic racism and police brutality.</p>
<p>“So you’re not offended by it?” Mr. Wallace asked Mr. Trump of the flag.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not offended, either, by Black Lives Matter,” Mr. Trump said. “That’s freedom of speech.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump said he could understand why Black Americans are upset about how police use force disproportionately against them.</p>
<p>“Of course I do. Of course I do,” the president said, adding his usual refrain that “whites are also killed, too.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump also hammered the Pentagon brass for favoring renaming bases that honor Confederate military leaders — a drive for change spurred by the national debate about race after George Floyd’s death.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what the military says,” the commander in chief said.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump stood behind his pledge to veto a $740 billion defense bill over a requirement that the Defense Department change the names of bases named for Confederate military leaders. That list includes Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Benning in Georgia.</p>
<p>The president argued there were no viable alternatives if the government ever tried. “We’re going to name it after the Rev. Al Sharpton?” Mr. Trump asked, referring to a prominent civil rights leader. “What are you going to name it?”</p>
<p>Amid a raft of polls showing him trailing Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump has remained defiant, and in the interview with Mr. Wallace, he again dismissed the survey results.</p>
<p>“First of all, I’m not losing, because those are fake polls,” Mr. Trump said. “They were fake in 2016, and now they’re even more fake. The polls were much worse in 2016.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wallace challenged Mr. Trump on some of his claims and called out the president at times, such as when Mr. Trump falsely asserted that “Biden wants to defund the police.” Mr. Biden has not joined with activists rallying behind that banner; in fact, he has proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump continued to insist that Mr. Biden “signed a charter” with one of his primary rivals on the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. At one point in the interview, Mr. Trump called on aides to bring him documentation to support his assertion. Mr. Trump, however, was unable to point to language from a Biden-Sanders task force policy document, released this month by the Biden campaign, to support his claim.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, 74, stuck to a campaign charge that Mr. Biden, 77, is unable to handle the rigors of the White House because of his age.</p>
<p>“I won’t lose,” he predicted.</p>
