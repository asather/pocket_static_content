<h1>Pitt's fall Olympic sports schedule delayed by the ACC</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While the 2020 college football season remains in limbo, Pitt’s fall Olympic sports — volleyball, soccer and cross country — were dealt a minor delay on Thursday.</p>
<p>The ACC announced that all Olympic sports will push back the start of competition until at least Sept. 1. The decision “allows each campus to further focus on ensuring return to competition protocols are in place to facilitate the resocialization process,” the conference noted in a press release.</p>
<p>The league also acknowledged that it continues to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on fall schedules “with the understanding that there may be future changes.”</p>
<p>The Sept. 1 date was selected by the ACC for an obvious reason: The conference’s football slate opens on Sept. 2, when NC State visits Louisville. Pitt’s 2020 season starts a few days later, as the Panthers are scheduled to host Miami (Ohio) on Sept. 5 at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>For now, that game is unmoved. But recent cases of COVID-19 on ACC campuses — and throughout college athletics — have prompted this Olympic sport delay, basically to buy the athletic departments a little more time.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, North Carolina paused its voluntary athletics workouts, while Louisville’s basketball program announced similar plans on Tuesday. Pitt has not announced any pauses or delays. It also will not disclose if student-athletes, specifically, test positive for COVID-19, instead updating an anonymous, campus-wide case count (including students, faculty and staff) on the university’s website.</p>
<p>Pat Narduzzi’s players returned to campus on June 8, while players from the men’s and women’s basketball, men’s and women’s soccer and volleyball teams returned on June 29.</p>
<p>Pitt’s soccer and volleyball players, as well as the cross country athletes, could potentially lose out on a few exhibitions and non-conference competitions. The 2020 schedules for those programs have not been released yet. Last year, Dan Fisher’s volleyball team announced its upcoming schedule in June, while the soccer programs announced in early July.</p>
<p>In 2019, Fisher’s ACC-winning squad, one that went 30-2 last season and featured <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2019/12/05/Pitt-volleyball-Kayla-Lund-s-journey-to-ACC-player-of-the-year-NCAA-tournament/stories/201912050159" target="_blank">conference player of the year Kayla Lund</a>, started its campaign with an intrasquad Blue-Gold scrimmage on Aug. 17, followed by an exhibition on Aug. 24 and three matches to close the month at Fitzgerald Field House.&nbsp;The women’s soccer team played two exhibitions and three games in August last year, while the men’s side had two exhibitions and its season opener. And Pitt cross country <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2019/08/29/pitt-cross-country-panthers-ncaa-carrie-blast-furnace-brad-herbster-darryl-weston/stories/201908280156" target="_blank">hosted its first home meet in decades</a> on Aug. 30, 2019.</p>
