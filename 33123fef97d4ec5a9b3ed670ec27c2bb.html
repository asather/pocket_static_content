<h1>Hospital ICUs are a chokepoint in caring for COVID-19 patients, Milan doctor says</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After the discovery of the virus that causes COVID-19 in Western Pennsylvania, the region should prepare for a rapid escalation in the number of cases that will fill hospital beds and stress the region’s medical system.</p>
<p>That’s the prediction of Giovanni Landoni, an anesthesiologist and intensivist at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, where the number of COVID-19 cases has been soaring since an outbreak of the new coronavirus in late February. It’s also the pattern seen in other places around the world where the novel coronavirus has been identified, he said.</p>
<p>“I’m quite sure it will be exponential,” Dr. Landoni, who has been working 19-hour days, said about the increase in cases in Western Pennsylvania. “That is what is happening everywhere.”</p>
<p>Outside of China, Italy has been the hardest hit area of the world, where at least 28,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed since the outbreak began Feb. 20 and more than 2,158 people have died. San Raffaele, a private hospital where Dr. Landoni works, is a 1,350-bed facility on a 72-acre campus near Milan, which is in the Lombardy region of Italy.</p>
<p>Lombardy is the epicenter of Italy’s outbreak.</p>
<p>Dr. Landoni’s experiences offer insights into how hospital intensive care units —&nbsp;and not emergency rooms —&nbsp;become the chokepoint in patient care when hospitals get overrun by new coronavirus patients. Lombardy physicians have also turned to assessing patients in tents set up outside hospital emergency rooms to reduce the chances of the infection getting inside the building, Dr. Landoni said.</p>
<p>“We’re still managing it, but we’re very close to a crash,” he said, adding that there is a waiting list of patients in the hospital who need to be intubated. “The ICUs are completely overloaded with dying patients. The situation is clearly worsening day by day and it’s not stabilized.”</p>
<p>Lombardy has some similarities to Western Pennsylvania but also some big differences: Lombardy’s population is 10 million compared to 2.3 million in the Pittsburgh metro area. And the Milan metro area had nearly 11 million tourists in 2019, which might help explain the rapid spread of the disease.</p>
<p>But like Western Pennsylvania, Lombardy has a large elderly population —&nbsp;22% age 65 and older compared to 19% in Allegheny County —&nbsp;and both regions have hospitals that offer sophisticated medical care.</p>
<p>Effective Tuesday, only emergency operations were being done at San Raffaele, which is the biggest surgical hospital in Italy, Dr. Landoni said.</p>
<p>“Emergency rooms are not the problem,” Dr. Landoni said. “The real issue is the ICU” where beds fill with new patients as quickly as they empty.</p>
<p>COVID-19 patients requiring treatment in an intensive care unit often suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome, where fluid leaks into the tiny air sacs of the lungs, interfering with the cellular exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen, Dr. Landoni said. Pneumonia caused by the virus is a common cause of ARDS and patients admitted to the ICU undergo intubation, where a slender plastic tube is inserted into the lungs, carrying oxygen from a mechanical ventilator.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the total cost of a pneumonia admission to the hospital for people with insurance ranged between $11,533 and $24,178, according to a new study by the Kaiser Family Foundation of San Francisco and New York City-based Peterson Center on Healthcare. Out-of-pocket expenses for patients with a pneumonia without complications averaged $1,464.</p>
<p>Although patients over 60 made up the early surge of ICU admissions to San Raffaele, later patients were in their 40s and 50s, he said, so the disease wasn’t limited to the elderly.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak, Lombardy’s 74 hospitals had about 720 critical care beds, which are usually 85% to 90% filled during the winter months, according to a review in Monday’s Journal of the American Medical Association. In the 18 days after the outbreak began with the first case Feb. 20, another 482 intensive care unit beds were added, about 60% of the region’s pre-crisis capacity.</p>
<p>Critically ill patients without the new coronavirus were moved outside Lombardy to make room for waves of new coronavirus patients. At the same time, ICU admissions “increased continuously and exponentially over the first two weeks” with 556 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals by March 7.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors of the JAMA study predicted between 869 and as many as 14,542 more ICU admissions to Lombardy hospitals by March 20.</p>
<p>“In practice, the health care system cannot sustain an uncontrolled outbreak and stronger containment measures are now the only realistic option to avoid the total collapse of the ICU system,” the study concluded. “Other health care systems should prepare for a massive increase in ICU demand during an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.”</p>
<p>All of Italy was placed on lockdown March 9, which was followed two days later by the closing of all non-essential businesses. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf took similar action Monday, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/03/16/pa-coronavirus-shutdown-pennsylvania-covid-19-gov-tom-wolf/stories/202003160109" target="_blank">ordering nonessential businesses to close for two weeks</a>, after the total number of people who tested positive for the new coronavirus reached 76.</p>
<p>Milan, a thriving international city normally bustling with visitors, has been turned into a “ghost town” by the pandemic, Dr. Landoni said.</p>
<p>UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside Hospital has the most hospital ICU beds in Allegheny County at 187 followed by Allegheny General Hospital with 122, according to the state Health Department. Many smaller community hospitals, including Heritage Valley Sewickley and Jefferson hospitals have none.</p>
<p>There are no intensive care hospital beds in Westmoreland County and only four in Bedford County, according to the health department.</p>
<p>But in case of emergency, hospitals could convert post-anesthesia and operating rooms to ICU beds, ramping up capacity in the event of a surge in the number of cases, according to the American Hospital Association.</p>
<p>Moreover, UPMC spokeswoman Susan Manko said in an emailed statement that the system’s hospitals have “always operated with the robust ability to flex up and flex down when needed.”</p>
<p>The JAMA article concludes with a warning that health care systems outside Italy “should prepare for a massive increase in ICU demand during an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.” In the meantime, disease detectives continue trying to track outbreaks and the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>“It’s completely unknown why this is striking us so severely,” Dr. Landoni said. “No common characteristic has been identified. There’s absolutely no pattern.”</p>
