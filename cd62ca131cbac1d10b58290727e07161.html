<h1>Gateway High to host in-person graduation at Monroeville Mall parking lot </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As high schools across the nation continue to find creative ways to celebrate their graduating seniors, Gateway High School in Monroeville has found its solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Gateway High School will host an in-person graduation ceremony in a parking lot outside Macy’s at Monroeville Mall. At 6:30 p.m., 239 seniors will take several buses —&nbsp;and stay socially distant — from the high school to the mall in a “parade-like” fashion, with an escort from the Monroeville police and fire departments.</p>
<p>At around 7 p.m., the seniors will be able to walk across a stage to receive their diploma covers. Friends and family can listen to a radio broadcast of the event safely from their cars. A live recording of the event will also be displayed on a large screen so the audience has a clear view of the graduates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gateway High School principal Justin Stephans said he&nbsp;“took off and ran” with the idea to host the graduation at Macy’s after Superintendent William Short first approached him about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It was an amazing idea,” Mr. Stephans said.&nbsp;“He’s a very innovative superintendent.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Stephans said the plan allows&nbsp;the seniors to graduate as an entire class, to walk across a stage, and gives friends and family members the chance to see the achievement.</p>
<p>“Those were the three goals to make it as special, as genuine, as authentic as we possibly can to a normal, traditional graduation, which we all know isn’t happening anywhere right now,” said Mr. Stephans, who is a 1996 Gateway grad.&nbsp;“I just know how important it is for the parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles that may have played an important part in the child’s life.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the plans were announced to students and their families, Mr. Stephans said he has received emails from grandparents thanking him for creating an opportunity where they can safely view their grandchildren’s graduation.&nbsp;“It’s definitely an exciting time for everybody involved,” Mr. Stephans said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macy’s store manager Danielle Meehan said she was excited to partner with the school after being approached by Tom Gerber, the mall’s general manager, about using Macy’s lot as the setting for the graduation. Ms. Meehan said the store will close one hour early at 6 p.m. Wednesday to provide time for the school to set up.</p>
<p>“My store team is excited,” Ms. Meehan said. So many of their family members or friends also have someone who goes to Gateway ... so being able to see this come together is exciting.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each senior will receive two parking passes, and Mr. Stephans believes there will be a huge turnout.</p>
<p>“They lost so much this year, that they deserve administrators working long hours to find creative ways to make an experience as special as possible and Macy’s and the Monroeville Mall helped make that happen.”</p>
