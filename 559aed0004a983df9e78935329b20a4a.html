<p>Disney+ did not throw away its shot with the live-action&nbsp;“Hamilton.” Now it’s at it again.</p>
<p>The premium streaming service has plans to present&nbsp;“Once On This Island,” a hit Broadway musical written by Dormont native Stephen Flaherty (music) and Lynn Ahrens (lyrics).</p>
<p>Jocelyn Bioh, who penned the acclaimed&nbsp;“School Girls; Or, The African Mean Girls Play,” will write the adaptation. Wanuri Kahiu directs, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Unlike&nbsp;“Hamilton,” it will not film actual performances but shoot it like a more traditional musical.</p>
<p>South Hills Catholic High School grad Flaherty (“Ragtime,”&nbsp;“Rocky”) and Ahrens lend song to the story of Ti Moune, a young peasant girl in the Caribbean who falls in love with a man above her station. Four gods play into her fortunes.</p>
<p>“Once On This Island” had its debut in 1990, with a Tony best revival-winning version in 2017 starring Alex Newell (“Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist”) and Hailey Kilgore. Casting has not been announced.</p>
