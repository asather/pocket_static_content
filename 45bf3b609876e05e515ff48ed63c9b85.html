<h1>3 new COVID-19 cases reported in Coachella Valley amid growing festival concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Riverside County health officials have announced three new cases of the novel coronavirus in the Coachella Valley, raising new questions about the fate of next month's Coachella music festival.</p>
<p>The individuals are believed to have traveled to an area with a known outbreak, or had contact with a known case, said Riverside County's public health officer, Dr. Cameron Kaiser. Two of the individuals have been isolated at home.</p>
<p>The third is at a Coachella Valley hospital. Riverside County announced its first locally-acquired case of a patient who is at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage.</p>
<p>The source of exposure is currently unknown and is considered a result of community transmission. Kaiser recommends that those in the Coachella Valley who are elderly and have underlying health conditions limit nonessential travel and avoid large public gatherings.</p>
<p>Riverside County also has a second confirmed case from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.</p>
<p>The passenger is receiving treatment at a Northern California hospital and has not been to Riverside County since leaving the ship.</p>
<p>The total number of COVID-19 cases in the county is six.</p>
<p>Riverside County declared a public health emergency after confirming its first case of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, Kaiser said no decisions have been made yet about the fate of the Coachella music festival, which is scheduled for the second and third weekends of April.&nbsp;Executives from festival promoter Goldenvoice or its parent company AEG have not made any announcements regarding cancellation or postponement of the festival, which has been long sold out — 125,000 fans are expected daily for each of its two weekends.</p>
<p>A petition calling for its cancellation had gathered nearly 15,000 signatures by Monday evening.</p>
<p>Riverside County public health officials said they’re in close contact with organizers and stand ready to make decisions based on the risks to the public.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure we can do anything to protect the community,” said Kim Saruwatari, the director of public health for Riverside County.</p>
<p>South by Southwest’s cancellation by city and county officials may have set a powerful precedent in how such massive music festivals deal with COVID-19.</p>
<p>AEG is not likely to unilaterally cancel the festival. If it calls off Coachella simply out of its own caution, the promoter’s insurance company would not be responsible for reimbursing AEG for its losses. However, in the event of a county-, city- or state-mandated cancellation, a “force majeure” clause (“superior force,” often referred to as the “hand of God”) would be triggered, and insurance would cover AEG’s expenses and lost revenue.</p>
<p>One industry executive familiar with Coachella’s financials said that it nets between $75 million and $100 million in profits annually, and that an insurance payout in the event of a force majeure could total between $150 million and $200 million.</p>
<p>Upon cancellation, ticket buyers would receive refunds.</p>
<p>Not everyone is hitting the panic button yet in the industry. One national festival executive who does not work on Coachella, speaking anonymously to be able to comment freely, said that “unless we’re told by the government to shut it down, we’re still moving forward with all our festival plans for the year.”</p>
<p>However, if Coachella does follow the examples set by Ultra and South by Southwest, the fallout could be significant for the Greater Palm Springs area, where hospitality is a dominant industry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, organizers of the BNP Paribas Open on Sunday canceled this year's tournament at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.</p>
