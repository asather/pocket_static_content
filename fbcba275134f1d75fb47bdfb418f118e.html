<h1>Allegheny County election officials describe around-the-clock efforts amid ‘perfect storm’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Convening for one last public board meeting before Pennsylvania's primary contests in two weeks, Allegheny County officials gave insight Tuesday into the difficulties facing their elections division as it processes a backlog of thousands of mail-in ballot applications and prepares for in-person voting in the midst of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Officials insisted that staffers in the elections division are working around the clock — three crews manning three shifts — to send mail-in ballots to voters in a timely manner, but confirmed that about 80,000 ballots are still waiting to be sent.</p>
<p>As those sit in the queue, applications continue to stream into the office every day — adding to the more than 225,000 applications it has received so far and the 189,000 it's processed, officials said.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>And as mail-in applications continue to flood their mailboxes, elections officials find themselves having to recruit poll workers for in-person voting precincts, make sure those workers are equipped with sanitary equipment and educate voters about where they're actually supposed to vote when the day comes.</p>
<p>All of this is what County Councilman and elections-board member Sam DeMarco called a "perfect storm” during Tuesday’s meeting, but for voters and the public at large, they'll have to wait until Election Day to see the results of the county's preparations.</p>
<p>Board member and County Councilwoman Bethany Hallam said her biggest concern remains how the elections division will have time to process all the mail-in ballot requests, "especially considering folks can request mail-in ballots up to one week before Election Day."</p>
<p>"I’m just worried about the timeline being two weeks out from election with 80,000-plus ballots yet to be mailed out," Ms. Hallam said, directing her inquiry to David Voye, who manages the election division.</p>
<p>Mr. Voye said the county is currently looking into “resourcing mailing companies” to do the mailing for them and help “pick up on the backlog.”</p>
<p>He also stressed that if there are voters who don’t receive their mail-in or absentee ballots on time, they can still vote a provisional ballot on Election Day. If it’s determined later that they already returned a mail-in ballot to the county,&nbsp;“the provisional will not be counted,” Mr. Voye said.</p>
<p>When asked by Ms. Hallam about voters who checked online to see their ballot was mailed out on May 1 but haven’t yet received it, Mr. Voye said the system is updated at the point a shipping label is printed — after which the county still has to pull the ballots, verify them, put them in envelopes with instruction forms and get them to the mail room.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t sound like a long process, but when you’re doing thousands of them, it takes time," Mr. Voye said.</p>
<p>One thing the county has crossed off its to-do list, officials said, is that they’ve sent mail-in ballot applications to all registered Democratic and Republican voters, as promised. The last batch of applications went out on May 13, Mr. Voye said. More than 600,000 have been sent in total.</p>
<p>"I know they're hitting mailboxes," Mr. Voye said, noting that he hasn't received any calls from voters worrying about the status of receiving an application.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the county continues to recruit poll workers to staff the 147 polling locations on primary day. Officials said they’ve recruited between 1,100 and 1,200 poll workers, close to their original target of 1,300 to 1,400.</p>
<p>"We feel confident that we should be able to have it adequately staffed by Election Day," Mr. Voye said.</p>
<p>Ms. Hallam — who joined her board colleagues in voting to increase poll worker pay to $200 — said that some poll workers have contacted her to say they've volunteered their efforts to the county&nbsp;and have been told they’re not needed. Mr. Voye insisted the county doesn’t want to turn anyone away, and said he is sure they can accommodate workers who are interested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before June 2, the county will mail every household information about changes in polling place, and post signage at defunct locations on Election Day directing voters where to go, Mr. Voye said.&nbsp;Some of the polling locations will have multiple check-in stations and multiple rooms, he added.</p>
<p>Voters will be encouraged by election workers to wear a mask and bring their own blue or black pen. Poll workers, in addition to being given printed guidance, will receive infection protection kits from the state — each with a personal bottle of hand sanitizer, gloves, masks, sanitary wipes and blue marking tape to mark off six-foot increments on the floor.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;“everything goes as planned” on Election Day, the county will start scanning and tallying the mail-in and absentee ballots at 7 a.m. — as permitted — and will be ready to put those results into the database shortly after polls close at 8 p.m., Mr. Voye said. Then, they’ll only have to scan the votes that were cast in-person.</p>
<p>The county has decided not to use precinct scanners this election&nbsp;“because we had so few poll workers trained on it,” Mr. Voye said.</p>
<p>Instead, votes will be tabulated and scanned at a central warehouse, which will require officials to transport ballot boxes the night of the election — a multi-step process that the county insists is monitored for security at each point.</p>
