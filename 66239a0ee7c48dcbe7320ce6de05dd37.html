<h1>Parish fish fries adapt to takeout-only recommendation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At St. Malachy Catholic Church in Kennedy, the fish-fry customers keep coming, even though the normally bustling cafeteria is quieter without the eat-in option.</p>
<p>Bishop David Zubik on Thursday urged parishes in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh to offer only take-out food rather than having the eat-in option, as part of the wider effort to reduce crowds and the potential spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>St. Malachy, which is part of Archangel Gabriel Parish, normally opens its fish fry at noon. But after 11, the customers were coming early as usual, and the volunteers filled a standing order of 80 fish sandwiches for a nearby business, said&nbsp;Janet Schipani, who takes the takeout orders by phone. On a typical Friday in Lent, the tables are full of eat-in customers as well.</p>
<p>“Elderly people, they like to come up here and talk with their friends, but they’ll have to take it home,” she said. The team is also taking other health precautions, like handing customers condiment packages individually rather than having them reach into buckets to get them.</p>
<p>Fish fries serve as both a major fundraiser and a social event that brings together members of the church and the wider community.</p>
<p>Churches such as St. Bernard and Our Lady of Grace in the South Hills switched immediately to takeout only.</p>
<p>St. Kilian Parish in Cranberry, which goes through more than 1,000 pounds of fish on a typical Friday in Lent, is keeping the eat-in option for this week only because it’s difficult to get the word out to everyone on short notice. But the Rev. Charles Bober, pastor of the parish, said the takeout portion of the evening fish fry has already grown each week this year and&nbsp;“we expect the largest portion of our sales are going to be takeout tonight.”</p>
<p>That said,&nbsp;“if someone is there and wants to eat in, there’ll be a space for them,” he said. But signs will be up everywhere announcing that starting next week, orders will be takeout only.</p>
<p>At Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church in McKees Rocks, which has a Lenten pierogi sale, the orders are coming in briskly, said volunteer Carol Lipchick. People pre-ordered 300 dozen pierogies, and&nbsp;“we’ll probably do 400 dozen” by day’s end. It is in a separate jurisdiction from the Diocese of Pittsburgh, and it is continuing to have space for eat-in customers, but most of the customers get takeout orders even in normal times.</p>
<p>Religious groups are adapting rapidly to the coronavirus spread. Bishop Zubik and other Pennsylvania Roman Catholic bishops have dispensed with Catholics’ obligation to attend Mass this weekend, but parishes will continue to offer Masses.</p>
<p>Orchard Hill Church will not hold in-person worship services at its Franklin Park, Strip District and Butler campuses. The services will be livestreamed.</p>
<p>At least two mosques in the region, the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, in Oakland, and the Muslim Association of Greater Pittsburgh, in Richland,&nbsp;canceled Friday Jummah prayers, the main service of the week, through the end of March.</p>
<p>The Muslim Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh, in Monroeville, is proceeding with Jummah prayers this Friday but urging anyone who is sick or vulnerable to stay home, and it’s asking anyone who has traveled internationally to wait 14 days before returning to the mosque. In Islam,&nbsp;“preventing harm is more important than bringing benefits,” said board member Salah&nbsp;Almoukamal, a primary-care doctor. The center is canceling Sunday school classes and will evaluate whether to hold Jummah prayers next Friday.</p>
<p>These announcements follow decisions by such congregations as Ascension Anglican Church and Rodef Shalom Congregation to cancel weekend services.</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints canceled worship services worldwide.</p>
<p>The Diocese of Greensburg postponed a men’s conference, which it anticipated would draw more than 1,000 attendees on March 21, to May 9.</p>
