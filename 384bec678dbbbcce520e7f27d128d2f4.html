<h1>Bert Kendall, former state championship girls basketball coach, resigns at Peters Township</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Only one season after his team went undefeated and won WPIAL and PIAA championships, Bert Kendall has resigned as Peters Township High School’s girls basketball coach.</p>
<p>Kendall had been the Indians’ coach for seven seasons and was selected the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2019/04/11/Girls-coach-of-the-year-Tim-McConnell-Chartiers-Valley-Bert-Kendall-Peters-Township/stories/201904080083" target="_blank">Post-Gazette co-Coach of the Year in 2019 </a>after Peters Township finished 30-0. The Indians are one of only five girls teams in WPIAL history to win a PIAA title with an undefeated record.</p>
<p>Kendall, 59, said his decision to retire had nothing to do with parents or school administrators. It was job related. He is a partner in a heating and air conditioning company and the job will require more travel in the future.</p>
<p>“I just have had an increasingly hard time balancing work and the time commitment to basketball,” Kendall said. “I see being out of town more in the fall and winter. How can you be the leader of a program and tell the kids to be committed, make every practice and then turn around and say, ‘By the way, I won’t be able to be here some next week?’</p>
<p>“We’ll have a brand new high school and gym next year. I’d love to have been around for that. But I know what it takes in terms of time to play at a championship level, and if I can’t do what’s right in terms of time, I have to do what’s right for the girls. I’m going to miss it, but I know it’s the right decision.”</p>
<p>Kendall spent seven seasons as Peters Township’s coach after nine seasons as an assistant for Jonna Burke at Bethel Park. Peters Township was 3-19 the season before Kendall took over. But Kendall won a section title in his third season and twice made it to the WPIAL Class 6A championship. His record was 110-58.</p>
<p>“It was a great run,” Kendall said. “I love the community and I love the school, but it’s just one of those things where there’s only 24 hours in a day.”</p>
<p>Peters Township was only 7-15 this year and missed the WPIAL playoffs, but Kendall isn’t leaving the cupboard bare. The Indians had only two seniors on the roster and feature Journey Thompson, one of the top sophomores in the WPIAL who already has Division I college scholarships.</p>
