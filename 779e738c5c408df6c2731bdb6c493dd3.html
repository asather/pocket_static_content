<h1>WATCH: Steelers’ James Conner surprises father with new truck</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just when we all thought James Conner’s story couldn’t get more heartwarming, he went and proved us all wrong yet again.</p>
<p>The Steelers’ running back posted a video to Twitter on Saturday of himself surprising his father, Glen Conner Sr., with a brand-new truck.</p>
<p>“Pop, it’s all yours!” proclaimed Conner, who is entering his fourth year with the Steelers.</p>
<p>His father was rendered speechless by the generous present, so Conner kept talking: “It’s yours. Look, it’s brand new. 2020, I got you. All black, you like it?”</p>
<p>Eventually, it seemed to sink in for Glen Conner that this truck was indeed now his, and he began to openly show his jubilation at the gift.</p>
<p>“Ain’t nobody can tell me nothin’ now!” he declared.</p>
<p>A few current and former NFL players praised Conner on social media for making his dad’s day in such an emphatic way.</p>
<p>Even actor Miles Teller weighed in with words of praise for Conner’s actions.</p>
<p>Conner isn’t the only Pittsburgh athlete to get his parents a new ride. Steelers receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster also <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/09/03/JuJu-Smith-Schuster-bought-stepfather-new-car-Cam-Heyward-Diontae-Johnson-Tyler-Boyd/stories/201909030124" target="_blank">bought his stepfather</a> a truck last September, and Pirates pitcher Chris Archer <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/12/26/pirates-chris-archer-christmas-surprise-parents/stories/201912260096" target="_blank">gave his parents</a> two new cars for Christmas last year.</p>
<p>At this point, Conner’s story should be well-known by everyone in Steelers Nation and beyond. The Erie native played football for Pitt, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in December 2015, announced he was cancer free in May 2016, finished his college career as a Panther, was drafted by the Steelers in 2017 and has been a staple of the team’s rushing attack ever since.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/02/james-conner-workout-covid-19-steelers-offseason/stories/202006020118" target="_blank">said last week</a> that even though he’s going into a contract year, money isn’t his main focus.</p>
<p>“I’m not playing for a contract or playing not to get hurt,” Conner said. “I’m playing to win, simple and plain. I have visions of us and me being a big part of Super Bowl No. 7 for this organization.”</p>
<p>Whether the Steelers make a Super Bowl run next season or not, Conner has already proven he is a champion-caliber son.</p>
