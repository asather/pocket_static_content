<h1>How a small, family owned deli shaped Pirates special assistant Oz Ocampo</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Growing up in Bergenfield, N.J., Oz Ocampo had an after-school activity different than most, one that would ultimately determine his career path.</p>
<p>When the dismissal bell sounded, Ocampo would load up his book bag and head to his parents’ deli store, where he’d work until 8 or 9 at night, operating the cash register, taking orders, stacking groceries, mopping the floor and even selling lottery tickets and cigarettes.</p>
<p>“You’d always see the same customers,” Ocampo said of the corner building (named Ocampo’s Phil-Am Deli Store) on Main St., a few blocks from where he attended elementary school. “You knew their orders. I even memorized peoples’ lottery numbers. I was pretty good at that.”</p>
<p>Ocampo has proven to be pretty good at this whole baseball thing, too, which is why the Pirates were thrilled to hire him as a special assistant to player personnel this past offseason after the 36-year-old decided to leave the Astros a couple weeks before allegations of their cheating surfaced.</p>
<p>In Houston, Ocampo led the Astros’ international operation from 2012-17, where he was responsible for scouting, player development, analytics and much more — a job that netted a heap of talented players.</p>
<p>Ocampo spent the past two seasons as a special assistant to former general manager Jeff Luhnow, where he traveled more with the major league club, helped with advance scouting and interpreted for players.</p>
<p>That role was great, Ocampo explained, but deciding to join the Pirates this offseason was a lot like his parents’ deli store: There’s ample work to do and a definite need for smart people to do it.</p>
<p>“I think there’s a strong core of young players here, and there are a lot of good things in place,” Ocampo said. “But there are things we all can continue to improve upon. I felt like that was going to be a fun and challenging situation with the people I met throughout the interview and get-to-know-you process.</p>
<p>“It felt like it was the right fit. It was very open and very much about wanting to learn and improve with a lot of great people.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Willing to do anything’</strong></p>
<p>The seven-day-a-week experience at the deli painted one picture of Ocampo’s passion, where he’d devour daily newspapers, chat up customers about their favorite teams and watch pretty much every Mets and Yankees game on TV.</p>
<p>But there’s also how Ocampo broke into baseball. During his senior year at Georgetown University, Ocampo decided to take a leave of absence and move to the Dominican Republic, basically going nuclear to nab a job in baseball and also following his own realization from the year before.</p>
<p>That’s when Ocampo spent a semester abroad, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and he witnessed first-hand the Superclásico soccer match between rivals Boca Juniors and Rivers Plate. That produced a pair of realizations.</p>
<p>"I knew I wanted to work in something that I was passionate about," Ocampo said. "What immediately came to mind was baseball."</p>
<p>And ...</p>
<p>"When I was thinking about how to get into the game, I had to really think about, what skills did I have could I bring to the table? I’ve always had a passion for baseball but also Latin America and working with people in leadership contexts."</p>
<p>So skip back to Ocampo's senior year, when he dropped everything to move to the Dominican Republic. He did so with no promise of a job and wound up cold-calling teams, trying to figure out what was available and who might be interested.</p>
<p>"I said I was willing to do anything," Ocampo said. "If you need me to throw batting practice, if you need me to hit fungos, if you need me to teach Spanish classes, if you need me to sweep the floor or do the cooking, I don’t care. I just want to work in the game."</p>
<p>Eventually Ocampo landed an internship at MLB's office of the commissioner in the Dominican Republic. And, when he moved back to the United States later that academic year, Ocampo fielded a call from the St. Louis Cardinals, who wanted Ocampo to run an academy they were starting in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>The salary was just $12,000, but the decision was a no-brainer for Ocampo.</p>
<p>"I remember seeing an alumni thing where they showed Georgetown graduates' starting salaries," Ocampo said. "There were probably a lot of people asking, ‘Hey, who's that guy making $12,000?' "</p>
<p>The same one who moved to the Dominican Republic early to start said job, finished his finals down there, then flew back for graduation, later earned his MBA at Columbia. The same one who would listen to Mike Francesca and Steve Somers on WFAN until 2 or 3 in the morning, obsessing over his baseball teams and also the Rangers and Devils.</p>
<p>When he did get free time as a kid, Ocampo would pretend he was Babe Ruth or Honus Wagner, then create fictional games where those players took on stars of the 1990s like Ken Griffey Jr. or Roberto Alomar.</p>
<p>"Baseball has been a love of mine since I was 5 or 6 years old,” Ocampo said. “That passion just grew and grew over the years that I worked at the deli.”</p>
<p><strong>'Over the long-term'</strong></p>
<p>What Ocampo did with the Astros has the attention of people around the industry. Current Houston prospects/stars Yuli Gurriel and Cionel Perez were signed out of Cuba on Ocampo's watch. Ditto for Mexico-born pitcher Jose Urquidy.</p>
<p>Franklin Perez, Jorge Alcala and Gilberto Celestino were pieces that helped them add Justin Verlander and All-Star reliever Ryan Pressly. Back in 2015, Ocampo pushed for Houston to sign Yordan Alvarez, a move that looks really good now after the Astros eventually acquired Alvarez via trade with the Dodgers, and he became the American League's Rookie of the Year in 2019.</p>
<p>For a team like the Pirates, who haven't had enough success on the international market, getting someone like Ocampo is huge.</p>
<p>"My job is really to assist and help out in any different area, where we can help the Pirates improve with scouting or player development and help to win over the long-term," said Ocampo, whose first name is actually Osbert, simultaneously honoring his dad (Oscar) and uncle (Robert).</p>
<p>Why Ocampo left the Astros had nothing to do with the cheating scandal, he said. His decision had actually been made a couple weeks before any of that stuff come out, and the biggest factor seemed to be wanting to spread his wings.</p>
<p>"I felt like I had done everything I wanted to accomplish while I was with Houston, building up the international program and doing that for 5-6 years, then going to the major league side and being with those same players that I had sort of moved up with through the minor leagues and into the big leagues," Ocampo said. "It was a really incredible experience and something that I was really grateful for."</p>
<p>After seeing general manager Ben Cherington take his current job, Ocampo said working for the Pirates was an easy decision. He’s known Cherington dating back to the latter’s time with the Red Sox, and Ocampo has a ton of respect for Cherington, especially his views on scouting and the value of international talent.</p>
<p>While the Pirates could sell Ocampo on opportunity, his presence will help them address two major needs: improving how they've fared on the international market and also filling the front office with as many talented and driven people as possible.</p>
<p>"My focus was trying to find the most challenging opportunity in combination of working with a great group of people,” Ocampo said. “Based off of all those factors, the Pirates offered the best overall situation.</p>
<p>"The ability to work across the organization as opposed to just focusing on one part, but also being able to do that in a very collaborative environment, was something that was really appealing to me."</p>
