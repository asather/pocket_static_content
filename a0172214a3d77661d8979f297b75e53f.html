<html><head><title>Police suspect drugs played role in death of convicted murderer at Fayette County prison</title></head><body><p>A murderer serving a life sentence for killing a Luzerne County fair queen died Monday at a state prison in Fayette County after, police say, he got high, fought with his cellmate and then had to be forcibly restrained.</p><p>Joseph Gacha, 42, was pronounced dead at 9:39 p.m. at State Correctional Institution Fayette, prison officials announced Thursday.</p><p>His autopsy results are pending toxicology and findings by a forensic pathologist, Phillip E. Reilly, the Fayette County coroner said.</p><p>But the lead investigator, Trooper Jason Zanolli, said Gacha was in a frenzied state when he died after fighting with his cellmate and prison guards.</p><p>“He was on some kind of illicit drug, and we’re waiting for toxicology to find out what was in his system,” Trooper Zanolli said.&nbsp;“They went in there and broke up the fight and dragged him out, and he petered out.”&nbsp;</p><p>The trooper added that Gacha was&nbsp;“more than likely” high on K2, a synthetic cannabinoid that has been the scourge of prison systems and local jails. Smoking the drug can make people sick from the fumes — Trooper Zanolli said there was no indication that happened in Gacha’s case — and can sometimes make users violent.</p><p>Problems began Monday night around 8:30 p.m. when Gacha, who was in general population, attacked his cellmate, the trooper said. Guards were alerted, and they rushed to his cell to break up the fight.</p><p>Prison staff put Gacha in a restraint chair and used pepper spray on him, according to Trooper Zanolli.</p><p>“They had a really tough time,” he said.</p><p>They took him to the infirmary, and it was there, while they were trying to remove his handcuffs, that he died as he struggled, the trooper said.</p><p>“He was fighting them the whole time.”</p><p>The trooper said the entire incident — including Gacha being restrained in the chair to his death — was captured on video. Tpr. Zanolli said CPR was performed on Gacha. EMTs from Brownsville Ambulance Service were present when he was pronounced dead, according to the prison.</p><p>Gacha came to SCI Fayette in December 2018.</p><p>In 2004, he killed Carrie Martin, a 20-year-old Luzerne County fair queen, by stabbing her dozens of times during a robbery that authorities say he committed with another man. The second suspect, Daniel Kukucha, killed himself in prison before trial.</p><p>Prison officials would not answer questions about the incident or the possible presence of K2 in the facility, citing ongoing investigations.</p></body></html>
