<h1>Starting nine: Jameson Taillon's progress, Nick Burdi's assist and Jose Osuna returns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A few nuggets from around Pirates summer camp on Wednesday at PNC Park:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Jameson Taillon continues to make progress in his return from a second Tommy John surgery and Tuesday threw off of a mound for the fifth time. This time, however, it was with the catcher squatting behind home plate.</p>
<p>The right-hander said he threw 20 pitches and was “pretty tired” afterward.</p>
<p>“The ball was coming out really, really well,” Taillon said. “Mechanics are feeling really strong. Waking up the next day and the elbow is feeling great, which is the most important thing.”</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">2.&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">The last time we talked to Taillon, he was unsure what the plan might be for him this season. Florida was one possibility. He could also remain in Pittsburgh. It seems it’s the latter, with an occasional trip to Altoona sprinkled in.</span></p>
<p>“I'm willing to do whatever it takes,” said Taillon, who won’t travel with the big club. “But I don't think going back to Florida is in the cards.”</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Another part of Taillon’s time in Pittsburgh will be functioning as a part-time coach. Some of that may involve helping with scouting reports. It could also include watching bullpens and offering feedback.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">It’s a role that Taillon said he’s still learning, especially when it comes to guys he doesn’t know as well.</span></p>
<p>“You have to earn some trust to be able to do that,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Nick Burdi’s wife, Rebecca, is pregnant. She’s also a nurse, works in an emergency room and is studying to become a nurse practitioner. However, Nick said that he never thought for a second about opting out.</p>
<p>He did, however, leave his wife back home, at least for a couple weeks, until Nick and Rebecca feel a little more comfortable with the whole situation.</p>
<p>“I think the Pirates have done a really good job here with the testing, masks, gloves, hand sanitizer everywhere,” Burdi said. “I think the medical staff needs to be applauded for that. At the same time, with that being said, I think MLB and the testing needs to get better so that we don’t run into a roadblock in a few weeks and we can get a season going.”</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> How the Pirates have fared compared to the rest of the league has been a popular topic of conversation. It really does seem as though they’ve taken this thing seriously, which Taillon discussed during his Zoom call.</p>
<p>“I'm glad that some guys around the league have spoken out because I think that brings attention to it and has made Major League Baseball take a review of what's going on and how they can get better,” Taillon said. “But I think we're running things really well here.”</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> In the week or so before he had surgery, Chris Archer started to pick Nick Burdi’s brain. Both had surgery to alleviate symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome, and Archer wanted to know what it was like.</p>
<p>Bad, Burdi would explain.</p>
<p>In the hospital for the first five days. Waking up every four hours. No water for the first day. Can’t eat much for the first three days. Burdi went on and on.</p>
<p>“I don’t think people realize how difficult of a surgery that really is,” said Burdi, who said it’s basically like being on bed rest for six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>Burdi said he actually sent Archer a basket of goodies that helped him — plant-based gummy candy and protein packets and brownies, basically a lot of stuff that’s high in fiber and carbohydrates but does not contain fat.</p>
<p>“You’re only allowed 20 grams of fat for the first four weeks,” Burdi said. “It’s a tough time, but we were able to talk. I think he’s recovering well, so it’s all trending in the right direction. Obviously the game of baseball needs him back and throwing again.”</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Tough break for Jose Osuna, who was among the group of players tested Friday who didn’t get their results back until Monday. Osuna said he was going stir-crazy sitting in a hotel room by himself, checking his phone around 6:30 every morning.</p>
<p>Osuna spent Tuesday working at first base and Wednesday at first and third base. But most of all, Osuna was simply happy to be back on a baseball field after a delay in testing.</p>
<p>“It’s where I wanted to be,” Osuna said.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Osuna spent part of the COVID-19 shutdown delivering food and other supplies to needy families back home in his native Venezuela.</p>
