<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf Saturday afternoon confirmed two new presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, bringing the total number of cases in the state to four.</p>
<p>Both of the new cases are individuals in Montgomery County who are in isolation at home, a release from the governor said. They&nbsp;“were exposed to an area of the United States where COVID-19 is present.”</p>
<p>“Even with these new cases, I want to reassure Pennsylvanians that the commonwealth is prepared and responding appropriately and swiftly so that information and resources are available,” Gov. Wolf wrote in the release.&nbsp;“I have been coordinating with legislative leaders from both parties, and we have agreed to immediately work toward a package that would provide resources to ensure we are aggressively mitigating the spread of COVID-19.”</p>
<p>The governor announced the state’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/07/pennsylvania-confirmed-coronavirus-cases-bucks-county-school/stories/202003070041" target="_blank">first two presumptive cases</a> on Friday were two adults, one in Delaware County and the other in Wayne County. They were quarantined in their homes and reportedly in&nbsp;“good physical condition” after they tested positive, Pennsylvania health secretary&nbsp;Rachel Levine said at a Friday press conference.</p>
<p>The virus on Saturday reached&nbsp;105,000 cases worldwide, including more than 3,500 deaths. There have been at least 401 cases and&nbsp;17 deaths in the United States.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department on Saturday again said there were no confirmed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/07/coronavirus-Allegheny-County-no-cases/stories/202003070043" target="_blank">cases in Allegheny County</a>.&nbsp;The ACHD is not providing information as to how many county residents have been tested or are in quarantine, department spokesperson Ryan Scarpino said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Thursday reported that a couple in Pittsburgh’s North Side were <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/05/Pittsburgh-COVID-19-quarantine-Grand-Princess-Frank-Tallarico-Kyle-Cunningham/stories/202003050194" target="_blank">under quarantine</a> after disembarking from the Grand Princess cruise ship, where 21 people on Friday <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/03/06/21-on-cruise-ship-off-California-test-positive-for-virus/stories/202003060165" target="_blank">tested positive</a> for COVID-19. The Pittsburgh residents said Thursday their preliminary tests were negative.</p>
<p>“We are making progress to increase our testing capacity to up to 150 specimens a day over the weekend,” Dr. Levine wrote in a statement. “This increased capacity allows us to continue to work with clinicians to ensure Pennsylvanians have access to testing.</p>
<p>“Since the start of flu season, we have encouraged Pennsylvanians to stop the spread of illnesses by washing your hands, covering coughs and sneezes, cleaning surfaces and staying home if you are sick,” Dr. Levine continued. “Those are the same healthy habits you should continue to practice to protect your family and yourself against the spread of this virus.”</p>
