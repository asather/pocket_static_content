<h1>Pittsburgh police make arrest in non-fatal Marshall-Shadeland shooting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh police have arrested an 18-year-old Duquesne man in a North Side shooting last month.</p>
<p>Tyrone Jackson is charged with attempted homicide, two counts of aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person and a firearms offense,</p>
<p>Police said Mr. Jackson wounded Jordan Greening, 18, of the North Side in a March 24 shootout along Brighton Road in the city’s Marshall-Shadeland neighborhood outside Hanini Market and Subs.</p>
<p>Detectives identified Mr. Jackson after reviewing surveillance video from a city camera and the convenience store that provided what a criminal complaint said was a clear view of the shooter’s face. They circulated the picture among their colleagues, and several police officers who had interacted with Mr. Jackson said they recognized him.</p>
<p>Police did not provide information in the complaint about a possible motive for the gunfire that they said broke out between Mr. Jackson and Mr. Greening last month around 7:30 p.m. in the 3200 block of Brighton Road.</p>
<p>They also did not indicate how badly Mr. Greening was hurt. He was driven to the hospital and walked in. The most recent update, right after the shooting, indicated that he had been wounded in the lower body but was in stable condition.</p>
<p>Officers were dispatched for two alerts on the ShotSpotter gunfire detection system, one for three rounds fired, and the other, five seconds later, for four rounds fired.</p>
<p>As they headed to the scene, a black Volkswagen Jetta sped past them in the opposite direction, blew through a red light and headed in the direction of Allegheny General Hospital. Police said Mr. Greening and three other men were&nbsp;in the car. Police seized the vehicle and found two places on the front passenger door where bullets had hit it.</p>
<p>A city camera on Brighton Road showed detectives the shooting as it unfolded.</p>
<p>Police watched as a tall, skinny man in a beanie and puffy, black jacket left the market and walked up to a vehicle. Mr. Jackson is listed in arrest paperwork as 6-foot-2 and 185 pounds.</p>
<p>The man then went to different vehicle.</p>
<p>“It appears that someone inside the vehicle may have handed the unidentified male a firearm,” the complaint said.</p>
<p>Then the man walked toward the Jetta, which was parked. He pulled a gun from his jacket pocket and started shooting at the victim from a few feet away, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Greening then drew a gun and returned fire, the complaint said.</p>
<p>The first shooter retreated and then started shooting again at Mr. Greening, according to police.</p>
<p>Mr. Greening got back in the Jetta, which sped away.</p>
<p>Police then got the video from the Hanini Market, which showed a man wearing the same clothing as the shooter leaving the market moments before the gunfire began, police said.</p>
<p>Five different police officers looked at the picture and identified Mr. Jackson, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Police arrested Mr. Jackson Wednesday afternoon during a SWAT situation at a house in the 1300 block of Woods Run Avenue in Marshall-Shadeland.</p>
<p>Detectives trying to find Mr. Jackson tracked him to the house where a suspect in an unrelated crime and a parole violation, Albert D. Johnson, was living, police said. According to a complaint, last week Johnson was listed on the state’s&nbsp;Board of Probation and Parole as one of the "Most Wanted Absconders."</p>
<p>Police set up surveillance on the house, SWAT made entry.&nbsp;Drugs, a gun and drug paraphernalia were found inside. Five&nbsp;of the six residents were arrested, either on outstanding warrants or drug charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson was arraigned and bail was set at $10,000. A picture provided by Pittsburgh police shows Mr. Jackson with what appears to be a surgical mask pulled below his chin.</p>
<p>In the complaint with information about Mr. Jackson’s arrest, police wrote: “Due to the current COVID19 pandemic, members of PBP [Pittsburgh Bureau of Police] utilized protective posture. The occupants of the residence were also placed into protective posture for their safety as well. (masks)”</p>
<p>Police also charged Mr. Greening with gun and drug offenses as well as tampering with evidence. His bail was set at $2,500 unsecured.</p>
<p>On Feb. 13, Pittsburgh police charged Mr. Jackson by summons with drug and motor vehicle violations, including driving with a suspended license.</p>
<p>Police said Mr. Jackson rolled through a stop sign on the North Side. An officer pulled him over and smelled marijuana inside the car, according to a complaint. Police found marijuana in the vehicle, which Mr. Jackson said belonged to him, the complaint said.</p>
