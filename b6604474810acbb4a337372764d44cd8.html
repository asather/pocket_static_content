About a month earlier, Conner had <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/07/Steelers-James-Conner-surprise-father-new-truck-video/stories/202006070118" target="_blank">gotten his father</a> a brand-new truck.</p>
<p>Current and form Pittsburgh athletes have been showing their families love in the form of expensive gifts quite a lot lately, from Pirates pitcher Chris Archer <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/12/26/pirates-chris-archer-christmas-surprise-parents/stories/201912260096" target="_blank">getting his parents two cars</a> for Christmas to former Pitt running back Qadree Ollison <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/22/Current-former-Pittsburgh-athletes-give-dads-unforgettable-Father-s-Day-weekend/stories/202006220083" target="_blank">purchasing his dad a house</a> for Father’s Day.</p>
<p>Enter Steelers receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who himself is no stranger to publicly expressing his appreciation for his family in the form of lavish presents.</p>
<p>In September, Smith-Schuster <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/09/03/JuJu-Smith-Schuster-bought-stepfather-new-car-Cam-Heyward-Diontae-Johnson-Tyler-Boyd/stories/201909030124" target="_blank">bought a truck for his stepfather</a>, Lawrence Schuster, a particularly thoughtful gift because he grew up in a one-car family and Lawrence would take the bus to work for the sake of his family’s comfort.</p>
<p>On Monday, he took care of his whole family by getting them a new house. As is usually the case with these videos, expect tears both from those involved and yourself.</p>
<p>Smith-Schuster has <a href="https://www.steelers.com/news/team-juju-starts-with-mom-19878096" target="_blank">one older sister and five younger siblings</a>, many of whom it seems will be living in this house based on the video.</p>
<p>The many sides of Smith-Schuster’s personality have been on display the last few days, from this effort to provide for his family to him putting on a giant fireworks show in the South Side on the Fourth of July.</p>
<p>Whatever you think of him as a person and football player, one thing’s for sure: Smith-Schuster’s content game has always been and continues to be strong.</p>
