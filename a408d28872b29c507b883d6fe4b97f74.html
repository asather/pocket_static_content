<h1>Tuned In: KDKA-TV adds 7:30 p.m. newscast</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>KDKA-TV will add a fourth evening newscast at 7:30 p.m. weeknights, beginning Aug. 17.</p>
<p>Meghan Schiller will anchor the half-hour of news, which will displace “Extra,” a syndicated newsmagazine.</p>
<p>KDKA-TV general manager Chris Cotugno confirmed KDKA’s latest expansion will be a traditional newscast but with a “focus on the more positive news of the day among other newsworthy items.”</p>
<p>He said the format of the show is a work in progress but it will include weather and possibly sports. The weather and sports anchors would be&nbsp; drawn from the earlier evening newscasts (Ray Petelin for weather, Bob Pompeani for sports).</p>
<p>WTAE introduced a live 7 p.m. newscast weeknights on Channel 4.2 over the air (and on cable) in February 2016. WPXI’s PCNC airs local news at 7 and 7:30 p.m. on cable.</p>
<p>“Extra” already runs an encore at 1:37 a.m. weeknights and may or may not get another run in an additional time slot once news takes over at 7:30 p.m.</p>
