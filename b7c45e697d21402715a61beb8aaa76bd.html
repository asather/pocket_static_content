<h1>Onetime Fred Rogers weekend retreat will be part of ‘forest with homes’</h1>

<p>The Hardie house — famous for once being Fred Rogers’ weekend retreat — will soon be a memory. Once it is torn down, a stone hearth and chimney that used to be the centerpiece of the original getaway will remain standing in honor of the television pioneer from Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Located on Old Mill Road, the home evolved from the Rogers retreat to the Hardie family home as Fox Chapel grew from a Pittsburgh outpost to a suburban enclave. When James Hardie died in 2018, the family sold the property to the borough for $885,000 with the provision that it become a park.</p>
<p>Since it acquired what is currently being called the Hardie Park last summer, Fox Chapel Mayor Alex Scott and the borough council have held community meetings so residents could have a say in how the park, which includes a waterfall and pond, is developed.</p>
<p>The council selected Pittsburgh-based landscape architect Pashak+MTR from a number of bidders to design the park.</p>
<p>The main reason the borough wanted the property is because it will become the keystone that connects all Fox Chapel parks and trails into one 350-acre nature preserve, keeping the borough’s identity as an environmentally conscious “forest with homes.” It will connect Old Squaw Trail to Riding Meadow Park and join with the Trillium Trail and Salamander Park, stretching from the O’Hara border to Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve on Dorseyville Road.</p>
<p>After many inspections and discussions, council unanimously voted last month to tear down the existing home and horse shed. As part of the Fox Chapel decree, every possible part of the house and barn was repurposed. Nova Environmental Remediation, of Ross, first contained and removed asbestos. Then Construction Junction dismantled and removed reusable materials from inside the home for resale at its Pittsburgh warehouse.</p>
<p>Leftovers were hauled away as part of the borough’s municipal complex stockpiled material contract.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott said the borough takes the same care when any new homeowner decides tearing down an existing home is the best way to create their dream. “It’s a project started by Jay Troutman to make sure we reuse and repurpose as much of the materials and plants as we can,” he said.</p>
<p>“It started with the plants,” said Mr. Troutman, vice president of Fox Chapel Borough Council. “I began to notice there was this wonderful landscaping around some of those homes. If the homeowners have no plans for the landscaping, we call garden clubs in the area so their members can take a lot of the plants around the house before they get trampled during the tear down.” Sometimes they sell them to raise money; sometimes they give them away; sometimes they keep them for themselves.</p>
<p>Cris Scott, the mayor’s wife and an honorary member of the Fox Chapel Garden Club, said members are notified by Mr. Troutman after the borough’s seven-member Environmental Advisory Council approves a building or grading permit for a homeowner. They and any of more than 20 local affiliates are then invited to save mature plants.</p>
<p>At the Hardie property, family member Janet Hardie showed garden club members Sally Foster and Peggy Jayme around the property so they could harvest flowers from around the home and ferns in the woods. “It’s nice to recycle these plants and have them to remember the family who came to us about them,” Mrs. Scott said.</p>
<p>Next come the building materials.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to reuse everything we can,” Mr. Troutman said. Windows, doors, cabinets and other fixtures are all removed and offered for resale. Sometimes the items are donated to the needy. In one case, appliances and other items from a property on Fairview Road known as Keith Turnbull’s Lake were donated to Allegheny Center Alliance Church on the North Side, where Mr. Turnbull’s son, Keith, is the pastor. Habitat for Humanity is another nonprofit the borough works with when distributing items.</p>
<p>“I like to think that’s what the residents would want us to do,” Mr. Troutman said. “I’d like to see this program continue long after my tenure on council.”</p>
