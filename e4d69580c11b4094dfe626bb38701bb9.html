<h1>Letters from Pirates camp: Bad baseball and a really good time</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">BRADENTON, Fla. — There’s always been something special about the (printed) newspaper and baseball, a symbiotic relationship akin to coffee and donuts, cookies and milk or ketchup and fries.</span></p>
<p>Before the internet, it was the only way to track what was happening around the league — who won, who’s hitting, all the numbers that make baseball great. Even now, as print is (sadly) dying, with fewer editions and way-too-early deadlines, there’s still nothing quite like a good baseball story in print.</p>
<p>That’s the way it is for me, and that’s the way it is for the other beat reporter at Pirates Fantasy Camp, Roy Berger, who spends his week here providing that service for a group of men and women who think the same way as we do. Berger watches games. He takes notes. He conducts interviews. And every morning, he produces a newsletter called The Jolly Roger, which is printed and placed in our lockers.</p>
<p>It’s a relatively new part of camp, as Berger last year approached Pirates director of alumni affairs, promotions and licensing Joe Billetdeaux — the guy who runs everything here at Pirate City — with the idea.</p>
<p>“I knew what the feeling would be like for everyone to walk into breakfast, to walk into their locker and pick up a paper and read about what happened to them the day before,” Berger said. “I think last year, from what I’m told, was a great success. They loved getting the online edition of this thing and sending it home to family and friends.”</p>
<p>“It’s something for people to send home and share with their families,” Billetdeaux added. “We’re posting it every day on our website. It helps some people at home, especially the campers who have done this before who aren’t here this week. It kills ‘em [not being here].”</p>
<p>What Berger, 67, does here really is neat. And also, before you laugh, know this: Fantasy camp is surprisingly competitive. Only minutes after my team’s 17-0 win Tuesday night at LECOM Park, one of my teammates, Randy Frame, had nailed down our playoff scenario: If we win Wednesday morning, we’re in. (We did, by the way.)</p>
<p>But while what Berger does helps all of us keep up on who’s winning, who’s losing and who’s putting up good numbers, it also adds a dose of levity in a (semi) public forum, which is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>For example, the top left of the front page includes a daily recap of Steve Blass’ Kangaroo Court, where every morning he doles out fines and has everyone in stitches — not literally — for 5-10 minutes. Much of Blass’ material here isn’t printable in a family newspaper, but the section gives campers something additional at which to chuckle.</p>
<p>There’s also a daily quote and a Did You Know section, with Wednesday’s pointing out that one of the campers (J.C. Loeber) is a standup comedian.</p>
<p>“The one feature that gets more readership than any is the Kangaroo Court thing because these people just cannot imagine some of these fines that are given out,” Berger said. “It has just turned out to be fun. It’s a lot of work for me, but it really is rewarding in the comments that I get and the appreciation that I get from these guys.”</p>
<p>It is a lot of work, as I can attest. Sitting here in the cafeteria, I’m stuffing a salad into my mouth while writing before I need to get ready for the second game of our doubleheader. But it’s also baseball in Florida in January — nowhere near anything to complain about.</p>
<p>Berger has an interesting story. He grew up on Long Island and became a Pirates fan because of his dad (who loved the Waner brothers) and also because of the 1960 World Series.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know any other thing,” Berger said. “I thought you had to be a Pirates fan.”</p>
<p>The day of Game 7, Berger ran home from school and made it in enough time to see Bill Mazeroski’s home run. And later, when his father got home from work, a rather special moment unfolded.</p>
<p>“When he got out of the car, we gave each other a hug on the driveway that will last me the rest of my life,” Berger said.</p>
<p>Fantasy camp was something Berger always wanted to do, and he decided to go for it in 2010, for the 50th anniversary of the ’60 series. Nervous he would fail miserably, Berger said he actually arranged plans to leave a day later — just in case.</p>
<p>The baseball was one thing, Berger thought. Maybe that will work out OK and get easier as the camp wore on. But he had no idea how he would muster up the courage to speak to some of his heroes — Mazeroski, Bill Virdon, Bob Skinner, Vernon Law, Bob Friend and Elroy Face — who would be at the camp.</p>
<p>“I stood there mesmerized,” said Berger, who recently moved to Las Vegas and lives in Summerlin, Nev., alongside several Golden Knights players. “I couldn’t believe it. I was scared to death to approach any of them.”</p>
<p>All parts of the camp grew easier, however, and Berger has since done nine Pirates, five Yankees and one Tigers camp.</p>
<p>“It’s become a way of life for me,” Berger said. “I have friends here who will be friends for the rest of my life, all because of this.”</p>
<p>Having covered high school sports for about seven years while starting out in this crazy business, I feel for Berger sometimes. We’re all trying, but we’re also not very good. He needs to watch all of that and make at least a little bit of sense out of it, enough to produce copy for the next morning.</p>
<p>(PNC Park’s Joe Klimchak is Berger’s design/layout editor.)</p>
<p>At the same time, Berger is having the time of his life. Retired from a PR career in the air medical business, Berger writes a blog called Sunday Morning Coffee (accessible via Facebook) and also does some writing for the Steinbrenner Field website, covering Yankees spring training.</p>
<p>“I think the role that I’ve evolved into is important to camp,” Berger said. “To me, there was always something missing. As a kid growing up, and still as an old guy today, a newspaper first thing in the morning is so vital to me.</p>
<p>“I’m really, really enjoying myself.”</p>
