<h1>Medical detectives could help open economy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Get ready for an army of medical detectives whose ambitious mission is finding everyone who came in contact with people infected with COVID-19 in the United States.</p>
<p>Experts say the unprecedented public health project will require hundreds of thousands of additional employees nationwide to make it work. It is work that needs to get done if the country hopes to reopen at all before any treatments or a vaccine for COVID-19 are created.</p>
<p>“Expanded testing [for COVID-19] on its own will identify the cases,” said Anita Cicero, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and co-author of the center’s April 10 analysis of what it would take to do <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/200410-national-plan-to-contact-tracing.pdf" target="_blank">a national COVID-19 contact tracing project</a>. “But without contact tracing we’ll never get ahead of the virus and we’ll always be chasing it.”</p>
<p>The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this week <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/principles-contact-tracing.html" target="_blank">provided general guidelines to state and local health agencies</a> about the role that contact tracing will have in the country’s attempt to reopen and warned them: “The time to start building the trained workforce is now.”</p>
<p>Both Allegheny County and the Pennsylvania Department of Health announced Wednesday that they have started to create expanded contact tracing teams as the state takes steps to reopen some parts of the state starting May 8.</p>
<p>“We’re developing a plan to figure out how many people we will need to hire, or work with other agencies who can help us with that,” said Allegheny County Health Department Director Dr. Debra Bogen at Wednesday’s online press conference.</p>
<p>Exactly how many workers the county or the state —&nbsp;which provides public health coverage for all but 10 municipalities and counties that have their own health departments, including Allegheny —&nbsp;will need to hire is not clear. Neither the state nor county health department have figured that out.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Department of Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said during Friday’s online press conference that the state’s 160 existing public health nurses will lead the contact tracing effort, and she expects hospitals and health systems to help, too, “and we’ll be hiring individuals to help us with that contact tracing.”</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Massachusetts, which has about 30% more COVID-19 deaths than Pennsylvania and about 20% more positive cases, began hiring 500 new health employees to help with contract tracing.</p>
<p>Allegheny County got a jump on its effort more than a month ago when it hired an unknown number of epidemiologists and medical workers to help its regular staff do contact tracing.</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen said despite those recent hires: “As we open up, we would need an increase in case investigators and contact tracers.”</p>
<p>Whatever the number is for the county and state, it will have to be duplicated nationwide to prevent a second deadly wave of infections, experts say.&nbsp;The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security study projected that at least 100,000 new employees would need to be hired nationwide to properly fill the needs. Former CDC director Thomas Frieden projected that it would need to be 300,000 new employees.</p>
<p>“Testing and contact tracing have to go hand-in-hand and both are enormously important in allowing us to relax social distancing rules,” Ms. Cicero said.</p>
<p><strong>Why it’s needed</strong></p>
<p>Contract tracing is as basic as it sounds: Tracking down everyone who an infected person had come in close, extended contact with —&nbsp;within six feet and for at least 30 minutes, the CDC says, though Allegheny County uses a minimum of 10 minutes —&nbsp;going back to two days before they began to show symptoms.</p>
<p>The contact tracers then call that list of people the infected person had contact with, quiz them about their own health and tell them to self-isolate for two weeks. If one of those contacts already has started to display COVID-19 symptoms, they are then asked to get tested, and contact tracing could be done on the contact. Dr. Catherine, a University of Pittsburgh associate professor of epidemiology and since March a member of Allegheny County’s contact tracing team, said she has had to contact as few as no contacts and as many as 15.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Historically, contact tracing’s first use appears to go back to the mid-1850s when </span><a style="font-size: 10pt;" href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-science-behind-contact-tracing-and-the-limitations-to-us-implementation-94c5c1a71186" target="_blank">a London physician named John Snow </a><span style="font-size: 10pt;">began doing contact tracing to track the spread of cholera. At about the same time, investigators used contact tracing </span><a style="font-size: 10pt;" href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=djglp" target="_blank">to track the spread of sexually transmitted disease among prostitutes</a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> and their customers.</span></p>
<p>But the practice did not become a formal part of public health practices in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/shm/article-abstract/9/2/195/1643760?redirectedFrom=PDF" target="_blank">Europe or the U.S. until the 1930s and 1940s</a>. That means it wasn’t used at all during the world’s last great pandemic —&nbsp;the 1918 Spanish Flu that killed millions around the world in a scourge that killed at least 4,500 in Pittsburgh, which gave it the highest death rate of any big city in the U.S.</p>
<p>“There really was no such thing as contact tracing then,” said Thomas Soltis, a professor of sociology at Westmoreland Community College who self-published a book last year about the impact of the 1918 Spanish Flu on Western Pennsylvania. “Remember, in 1918 they really didn’t even understand how it was transmitted.”</p>
<p>But in the century since that pandemic, contact tracing became a standard part of public health agencies’ weapons to stop the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>It has been used to stop the spread of tuberculosis, Ebola, SARS, and sexual transmitted diseases, including HIV, among others.</p>
<p>One big difference from those, however, is that they “haven’t been as widespread and not had nearly as many asymptomatic cases” as COVID-19, which will require many more people to trace every contact, said Dr. Mark McClellan, director of Duke University’s Health Policy Center and former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>“In that way, this effort [for COVID-19] is going to be at an unprecedented level,” said Dr. McClellan, co-author of a March 28 <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/National-Coronavirus-Response-a-Road-Map-to-Recovering-2.pdf" target="_blank">proposal for the reopening of the U.S. by the American Enterprise Institute </a>&nbsp;that called for an effort nationally to “massively scale contact tracing.”</p>
<p>Already during the COVID-19 pandemic, countries including New Zealand, Iceland, South Korea and China, credit effective contact tracing with helping to greatly flatten the curves in those countries.</p>
<p>The Johns Hopkins team looked at all of those countries’ efforts to try to figure out how many new contact tracing employees might be needed in the U.S., and found that the ratio of tracers to cases varied widely, said Ms. Cicero, who grew up in New Castle.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s a magic number that works best, but six figures [of new employees] is in the ballpark” based on what worked in other countries, she said. The center estimated those 100,000 new employees would cost about $3.6 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Armies or apps?</strong></p>
<p>Both the American Enterprise Institute and Johns Hopkins’ reports called for the use of technological solutions to help the army of public health workers who will be needed for this effort.</p>
<p>“Technologies are also needed to aid this process,” the Hopkins’ report said in part. “They can act as a force multiplier so that 1 worker can connect with many more people in the community. They can also enable contact tracing without exposing workers to infection.”</p>
<p>Already, Europe is using a phone app known as PEPP-PT —&nbsp;Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing —&nbsp;to identify the phones through an encrypted code of people who may have been in close proximity to those with the virus. That system is designed to avoid violating privacy.</p>
<p>Neither the state nor Allegheny County have identified any specific technological aid they would use, but Dr. Levine said Friday that the state will “look at what specific technology will be able to help us with this endeavor.”</p>
<p>Though PEPP-PT technology involves a phone app that measures distances and records an encrypted code that is then used to send a notification to all phones that came within close proximity of anyone who has become infected. Those people in turn are required to isolate themselves. The system is heralded for protecting privacy because it doesn’t record location, or any personal information or other data that would allow identification of the user, which was a problem with apps used in South Korea and China.</p>
<p>Contact tracing showed some success in recent epidemics but the time-consuming, labor-intense methodical process can take days, even weeks, to complete the investigation involving just one infected person.</p>
<p>For that reason, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, recently blogged that the use of cell phone apps in contact tracing is necessary for the process to succeed.</p>
<p>He said traditional contact tracing “involves a team of public health workers who talk to people via the phone or in face-to-face meetings.”</p>
<p>“This time-consuming, methodical process is usually measured in days, and can even stretch to weeks in complex situations with multiple contacts,” he said in the blog. “But researchers are now proposing to take advantage of digital technology to try to get contact tracing done much faster, perhaps in just a few hours.”</p>
<p>A British study showed that the traditional method of contact tracing failed to stay ahead of the virus.</p>
<p>”When they examined the situation in China, the researchers found that available data show a correlation between the roll-out of smart phone contact-tracing apps and the emergence of what appears to be sustained suppression of COVID-19 infection,” Dr. Collins stated. “Their analyses showed that the same held true in South Korea, where data collected through a smart phone app was used to recommend quarantine.”</p>
<p>For such a plan to succeed, all people must download the app, leading researchers to question the ethics of any apps that can raise issues about protecting privacy.</p>
<p>“Here at NIH, we have a team that is actively exploring the kind of technology that could achieve the benefits without unduly compromising personal privacy,” Dr. Collins said.</p>
<p>Lessons learned from the 2014-15 West Africa Ebola outbreak have helped the United States and other countries respond to COVID-19 but few would have thought it necessary to reach this stage, during which investigators are trying to track down and find every COVID-19 case while the virus is still being transmitted, one study said.</p>
<p>It concluded that developing a workable model involving contact tracing is difficult to achieve during a pandemic but offered recommendations on how public health administrators and modeling researchers could achieve that.</p>
<p>A March 2017 study in African Health Science journal, focused on the 2015 Ebola outbreak in western Africa, said proper testing, treatment and gaining public support all were key to the success of contact tracing.</p>
<p>“The strategy of contact tracing has a great potential to significantly reduce the incidence of cases of Ebola virus disease,” the study said. “However, its success is eventually determined by the level of trust between the community and the public health system and the quality of the diagnostic and treatment services.”</p>
