<h1>Unlike nationwide European lockdowns, aggressive restrictions on movement depend on location in the U.S.</h1>

<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues its exponential spread across the United States, the “new normal” for most Americans is social distancing and varying degrees of inconvenience to daily lives from the closure of non-essential businesses.</p>
<p>But when there is a spike in confirmed cases in America — an inevitability as testing increases in scale — what is the likelihood of an imposition across the U.S. of draconian government-ordered restrictions, such as the lockdowns seen in China, Italy, France and other countries trying to flatten the curve of virus exposure by requiring residents to stay in their homes with few exceptions?</p>
<p>Little if any. Despite the fact President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in connection to the COVID-19 pandemic under the National Emergencies Act of 1978, none of the 123 powers made available to him permit the all-encompassing shutdown of daily life that other countries have put into force, said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.</p>
<p>“Under federal law, a mandated national lockdown is not a possibility,” said Ms. Goitein, co-director of the center’s Liberty and National Security Program. “The United States has a different framework than other countries. Italy is a democracy but it is limited in the governmental and individual rights that we have.”</p>
<p>Ms. Goitein questioned why Mr. Trump even declared a national emergency on March 13 because all of the help the federal government has provided or is likely to provide was already empowered. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency on Jan. 31, which provided aid to the nation’s health care community, and Mr. Trump on March 13 invoked the Stafford Act of 1988, which provides for natural disaster assistance for state and local governments.</p>
<p>“Maybe optically he wanted to be seen as taking this seriously. Declaring a national emergency is more powerful sounding than saying you are invoking the Stafford Act,” she said.</p>
<p>The authority banning gatherings and all but essential services, and requiring residents to shelter in place, among other aggressive measures, rests individually with each state and, lacking that imposition, with municipalities. Understandably, the likelihood that all 50 states will order such lockdowns is small.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean Pennsylvanians in general or Pittsburghers specifically won’t face more aggressive restrictions than are already in place in a statewide effort to stem the rising tide of infection here. Much as in real estate, it all depends upon “location, location, location.” The worse the situation is in a locale, the likelihood increases that governmental authorities there or on a statewide level may impose more stringent strategies. For now, like so much of the trajectory of COVID-19, it’s just too early to tell.</p>
<p>For example, nearly seven million people in San Francisco and a large swath of northern California had been ordered by health officials to shelter in place since midnight Monday as authorities tried to stop the novel coronavirus from spreading. That order, and a mayoral directive closing bars, restaurants and other businesses in Los Angeles, didn’t affect the rest of California. But Thursday night, California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statewide stay-at-home order starting immediately, and affecting 40 million people, making for the most widespread and stringent measures imposed in the United States.</p>
<p>Earlier Thursday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bluntly rejected New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s suggestion that the city may soon implement a “shelter in place” order. “Look, I would know, I would have to authorize those actions. It’s not going to happen,” Mr. Cuomo told reporters.&nbsp;But by Friday, Cuomo did what Newsom had done less than a day earlier and issued a stay-at-home order for the state’s 19.5 million citizens.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuomo added that fears associated with the coronavirus are “as contagious or more contagious than the virus. Misinformation, emotion, fear, panic, [are] truly more dangerous than the virus.” But by Friday, Cuomo did that Newsom had done and ordered a state-at-home order for the state’s 19.5 million people.</p>
<p>And later Friday,&nbsp;Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a similar order for the state's 12.6 million residents to remain in their homes except for essential needs,</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, the governor has broad powers under an emergency declaration. On Monday, Gov. Tom Wolf extended a shutdown order to the entire state to nonessential businesses in all 67 counties. On Thursday afternoon,&nbsp;Gov. Wolf ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses in Pennsylvania to close their physical locations as of 8 p.m to slow the spread of COVID-19. “Enforcement actions against businesses that do not close physical locations will begin at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, March 21,” a very brief news release read.</p>
<p>The Wolf Administration also has closed schools, state-run liquor stores, state park facilities, and implemented no-visitor policies at correctional facilities and nursing homes statewide. Additionally, the Department of Transportation closed all driver’s license and driver’s license photo centers, and extended the validity of expiring driver’s licenses, vehicle registrations, and inspections until the end of April.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Gov. Wolf requested that the U.S. Small Business Administration implement an SBA disaster declaration to provide assistance in the form of SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans for businesses and eligible non-profits in all 67 counties in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto declared a state of emergency March 13 paired with an executive order limiting gatherings in city limits to 250 or less.</p>
<p>“This state of emergency authorizes the mayor to cancel or limit large gatherings, cancel or limit events that require city permits, encourages the use of social distancing to lessen exposure and transmission of the virus, cancel or limit city services, and cancel or limit public and private activities that can further increase exposure or transmission of the disease,” Dan Gilman, Mr. Peduto’s chief of staff said upon the announcement, adding that he is unaware of a time in Pittsburgh’s history when a mayor has taken that action.</p>
<p>Before the city could even get through the weekend, Allegheny County announced its first identified case of COVID-19 on March 14, and by nightfall on March 15, Mr. Peduto amended his order to ban gatherings of 50 or more.</p>
<p>In such emergency circumstances, the mayor is granted powers of enforcement under a matrix of state and local law, according to the city’s Law Department.</p>
<p>That mix includes powers granted under the Pennsylvania Disease Prevention and Control Law of 1955 and Emergency Management Services Code of 1996, as well as the Pittsburgh City Code and Home Rule Charter, traditional police powers and decisional law.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, the city had not taken enforcement action under the ban on gatherings, and some of the power shifted to state law enforcement anyhow when the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board announced it would be strictly enforcing a ban on dine-in venues licensed under the authority.</p>
<p>As for special event permits in the city — the St. Patrick’s Day parade, for example — “all of them have voluntarily either postponed or canceled,” said Timothy McNulty, mayoral spokesman.</p>
<p>“We have heard from a few venues scheduled to host banquets, weddings and other events to double-check the city’s ban on gatherings over 50 people,” he said in a written statement. “Everyone has been very understanding — no one wants to attend such events right now anyway.”</p>
