<h1>A $2.3 trillion question after stimulus bill: What more is needed for Pittsburgh?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Last month, Capitol Hill was a remarkable scene of solidarity: All 99 senators voted to pass the largest stimulus package in U.S. history, and, two days later, the House followed suit with fast-tracked approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so came the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, a $2.3 trillion economic spending package signed by President Donald Trump on March 27, providing loans to businesses, cash payments to most Americans and support to hospitals and health care research.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The agreement did not end there. Lawmakers from both parties acknowledged there would almost certainly be more legislation to come — after three COVID-19 response bills passed in March.</p>
<p>The virus has shuttered businesses, sent millions into unemployment, curtailed all non-essential travel and forced a nation of 329 million people to maintain a six-foot remove from one another. With Mr. Trump extending current health guidelines through at least April 30,&nbsp;talks have already begun on a fourth package.</p>
<p>“We have to pass another bill that goes to meeting the need more substantially than we have,”&nbsp;House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said last week.&nbsp;She has told reporters she hopes the bill will focus on “recovery” efforts instead of an emergency rescue.</p>
<p>The prospect of a similarly quick passage are dim for such a measure, with&nbsp;lawmakers and interest groups lining up to debate who should receive the coming windfall of government aid.</p>
<p>At the top of mind is Congress’ long-held plan to invest in infrastructure.&nbsp;Ms. Pelosi has supported an infrastructure plan, and Mr. Trump tweeted that he wants a $2 trillion investment.</p>
<p>“With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO,” the president tweeted last week, “this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill. It should be VERY BIG &amp; BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4.”</p>
<p>Such a plan would be a boon for Pittsburgh-area steel, construction and manufacturing industries.</p>
<p>“Infrastructure is a key way to get the economy back moving again,” said Thomas J. Gibson,&nbsp;president and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute.</p>
<p>The Washington-based steel association, joining construction trade groups, launched an advertising campaign last month to press Congress to fund roads, bridges and other transportation projects.</p>
<p>Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, pointed to the economic power of those projects — in Western Pennsylvania, he said, that means securing the electric grid, building resilience against landslides and flooding, and repairing century-old locks and dams.</p>
<p>“We can spend a lot of money for a public good,” Mr. Lamb said. “Personally, I think the money spent on transportation and infrastructure goes farther for the economy than almost any type of spending. It goes farther than things like tax cuts, and it does things that we really need.”</p>
<p>“These are all the kinds of things we can do in the next round of bills,” Mr. Lamb said.</p>
<p><strong>Proposals and battles</strong></p>
<p>Yet many proposals could lead to political battles.&nbsp;Last week,&nbsp;Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., threw cold water on Ms. Pelosi’s plans for a quick bill.</p>
<p>“I think we need to wait a few days here, a few weeks, and see how things are working out,” Mr. McConnell said. “Let's see how things are going and respond accordingly. I'm not going to allow this to be an opportunity for the Democrats to achieve unrelated policy items that they would not otherwise be able to pass.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to infrastructure, Ms. Pelosi said, she wants to review a contentious part of the 2017 GOP tax cuts that limited how much Americans can deduct from state and local tax deductions.</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., suggested last week that move would be a non-starter with Republicans.</p>
<p>“The ink is hardly dry on a $2 trillion-plus emergency package,” he said. “It’s far too soon to know whether, and of what nature, additional legislation is needed.”</p>
<p>“If we determine that another measure is necessary, it should not be the vehicle for Speaker Pelosi’s partisan, parochial wish list,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>Groups worried about the yawning federal budget deficit are sounding the alarm.&nbsp;A study last week by Morgan Stanley estimates the U.S. deficit will total at least $3.7 trillion in calendar year 2020 and run an additional $3 trillion in 2021. The deficit relative to the size of the economy could even approach 20% — numbers last seen during World War II.</p>
<p>The next bill needs to stay&nbsp;“laser-focused” on health care needs and targeting the pockets of the economy that will be slow to rebound, like airlines and hospitality businesses, said&nbsp;Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</p>
<p>“You know everybody’s going to dress up the same policies they’ve loved for years and promise they are the perfect elixir for a struggling economy,” Ms. MacGuineas said in an interview.&nbsp;“It breeds such political cynicism to see people pushing ideas like that at a time of a true national emergency, when we should be focused singularly on what will be best for the economy.”</p>
<p>The stimulus bill created a special inspector general for pandemic recovery, but that person must first be nominated by Mr. Trump and then confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p>How the next bill plays out could hinge on how small businesses and local governments respond to the stimulus money.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>The&nbsp;$350 billion loan program for businesses with 500 or fewer employees offers full forgiveness for loan money used on payroll, rent, utilities and existing business debt through June 30.&nbsp;The loan forgiveness may be reduced if the business lays off employees or cuts the paychecks of lower-wage employees.</p>
<p>“There is a recognition that this is the beginning of the federal government coming in to support the economy, not the middle or the end,” Matt Smith, president of the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, said.</p>
<p>“To me, the question of whether it’s enough is directly related to the speed with which it is deployed,” Mr. Smith said. “I think the faster that money is deployed, the more there’s going to be clarity on what the next step is going to be.”&nbsp;</p>
