<h1>Class 4A Greater Allegheny: No clear favorite in wide-open race for conference title</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Class 4A Greater Allegheny Conference looks as wide open as any heading into the 2020 season.</p>
<p>While the favorite to emerge as the conference champion at the end of the year is anybody’s guess, it’s no mystery who will be the marquee player to watch — <strong>Mars</strong> senior “Touchdown” Teddy Ruffner.</p>
<p>Ruffner (5-11, 185) finished sixth in the WPIAL with 1,919 yards rushing on 263 carries in his first season as a starter, while his 26 touchdowns were tied for eighth best. Now, with the Planets dropping down from Class 5A to 4A, Planets coach Scott Heinauer is expecting another big year out of the speedy tailback.</p>
<p>“Obviously, he’s going to have improvement,” Heinauer said. “He’s an important person to have.”</p>
<p>Ruffner won’t be able to do it alone, though, and fellow senior running back Ben Chizmar (6-1, 215), appears to be in for an increased role this season as Mars’ change-of-pace back. Still, with all-state lineman Michael Carmody having moved on to Notre Dame, it could be tough for the Planets to make their 15th consecutive postseason appearance if their inexperienced line can’t find a way to mesh quickly.</p>
<p>The only other team in the conference coming off a winning season in 2019, <strong>Knoch</strong> will have some holes to fill in order to get back to the postseason for the first time since 2014.</p>
<p>The Knights will have a hard time trying to make up for the lost production of running back Matt Goodlin, who put together back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons even while playing in only eight games as a senior. Keith Washington did rush for 458 yards last year on 82 carries, though it’s unclear whether he’ll start the season at quarterback or running back.</p>
<p>“Over the past three years, we’ve improved one win each year,” said Knoch coach Brandon Mowry. “Just continuing to build off that improvement and get into the playoffs, and once you get into the tournament, you never know what can happen from there.”</p>
<p><strong>Greensburg Salem</strong> went 5-2 in conference play to earn a playoff berth last season, although the Golden Lions failed to win a non-conference matchup and dropped their first-round playoff matchup to Blackhawk, 36-7.</p>
<p>This year, they’ll have top rusher Alex Briggs back after racking up 648 yards and five touchdowns as a junior. Paving the way for Briggs up front will be senior Joe McGough (6-3, 275), an all-conference selection last season, and junior Billy McChesney (6-1, 255), who has started on both offense and defense since his freshman year.</p>
<p>“We’ve created an identity of what we want to be and what we try to be,” said Greensburg Salem coach Dave Keefer. “We respect those teams like the South Fayettes and the T.J.s, and we look at it as a tremendous opportunity to go and compete against them.”</p>
<p>After an 0-4 start, <strong>Highlands</strong> rebounded to win three of its last six games in 2019, including a 28-22 upset vs. New Castle. This year, the Golden Rams must find a way to make up for the loss of high-flying wide receiver Johnny Crise on the outside. Crise, now a walk-on at Penn State, caught 38 passes for 729 yards and seven touchdowns last year.</p>
<p>Domenick Girardi’s squad does have its leading rusher returning in junior Brock White, who totaled 809 yards and seven touchdowns on 177 carries as a sophomore.</p>
<p><strong>Hampton</strong> is another team eager to experience some fresh competition after dropping down from Class 5A. Talbots coach Jacque DeMatteo said players such as Dawson Dietz and Gage Galuska will be counted on to step up on both sides of the ball.</p>
<p>“We had guys trying to go two ways against teams with a 75-man roster. We are a 45-man team,” DeMatteo said. “I see more of an optimistic approach from the kids. Not to take away from any of the teams that we’re playing, it’s just that now we’re playing against teams of our size.”</p>
<p>Yet another team dropping in classification is <strong>Plum</strong>, which has a plethora of starters returning from a team that finished 3-7 last year. The Mustangs will be an experienced group led by quarterback Jake Miller, running back Billy Guzzi and dynamic pass-catchers Reed Martin and Max Matolcsy.</p>
<p>Martin totaled 583 yards from scrimmage with 10 touchdowns last year, while Matolcsy added 527 yards and six scores.</p>
<p>At <strong>Armstrong</strong>, the days of the River Hawks being carried to the WPIAL playoffs by record-setting running back Zane Dudek are long gone. Still, Frank Fabian’s unit is only one year removed from its last postseason berth, and he believes last year’s 1-8 record may have been an anomaly.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Indiana</strong> coach Brandon Overdorff is hopeful that a veteran offensive line led by senior guard Matt Nelson (6-2, 275) has what it takes to keep junior quarterback Fox Van Leer healthy after a sophomore season in which he showed signs of promise.</p>
<p>“We’re still going to be pretty young,” Overdorff said. “But last year we were really young, too, and we got a lot of experience, so we got a lot of kids back. Especially at the skill positions, we’ll be young, but up front will probably be our strength.”</p>
