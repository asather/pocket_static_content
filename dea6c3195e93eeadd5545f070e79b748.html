<h1>Upcoming Western Pa. soccer tournament has public health officials concerned</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With a little more than 150 teams expected to attend a youth soccer tournament in Plum this weekend, public health officials are concerned about the potential for increased spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>The Plum Kick-Off Classic is a three-day tournament that hosts travel soccer teams from Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio for U9 to U14/15 teams. Previously, the tournament hosted more than 200 teams, but this year organizers have cut back due to coronavirus concerns.</p>
<p>As part of the tournament’s COVID-19 protocols, each player is permitted one spectator at the Plum or Monroeville fields and two spectators at the Murrysville Community Park or Murrysville Veteran’s Field. Spectators will have a designated viewing area, at least 20 yards away from the playing field.</p>
<p>All attendees are required to wear a face mask and adhere to social distancing rules.</p>
<p>Kevin Schlegel, the co-director of Plum Area Soccer, the group that organizes the tournament, said that the organization will have several of its board members that will act as site supervisors to enforce the protocols they have put in place. All staff members will have their temperature taken prior to starting.</p>
<p>Dr. Debra Bogen, director of the Allegheny County Health Department, is still concerned about the potential for the virus spreading at the tournament.</p>
<p>“If you have somebody who is not symptomatic — and again many people in this age group are asymptomatic — they can effectively spread the virus to a large group of people,” she said at a press conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The outdoor gathering capacity in Allegheny County is still capped at 50 people.</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen also noted that cheering and yelling is a very effective way to spread the virus and heavily encouraged all spectators to wear a mask.</p>
<p>But Mr. Schlegel said tournament organizers have taken the necessary precautions.</p>
<p>“I believe that the protocols that we have in place are solid,” said Mr. Schlegel. “They are very detailed, and they follow the recommendations of the state and county to have a safe environment.”</p>
<p>All players and coaches are expected to stay at least 6 feet apart and wear face masks on the sidelines. The only time a player can remove their mask is during warm-ups or playing time.</p>
<p>At the end of the tournament, organizers will not hold an awards ceremony for the winners.</p>
<p>The protocols also encourage everyone in attendance, including players, to bring their own hand sanitizer. Also, concession stands will not be open for this year’s tournament.</p>
<p>Mr. Schlegel said the&nbsp;guidelines the organizers came up with were submitted to the county two weeks ago through his group’s county representative.</p>
<p>County spokeswoman Amie Downs said that the health department is not currently approving any protocols or plans.</p>
<p>“My understanding is that we had no interaction with this group at all until yesterday [Wednesday] when we pulled the information that they had posted online and were going to reach out,” she said, adding that she would check with county officials to confirm guidelines were submitted.</p>
<p>County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said in a press conference Wednesday that the health department has plans to “check in” on the tournament this weekend.</p>
