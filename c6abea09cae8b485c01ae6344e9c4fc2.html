<html><head><title>Paul Zeise: NCAA tournament bid isn't an unrealistic goal for Pitt </title></head><body><p>Pitt will dive back into ACC conference play Saturday with a home game against Wake Forest. It is the kind of ACC game the Panthers haven’t played in a few years — one they are absolutely supposed to win. That in and of itself says a lot about the progress that has been made by Jeff Capel and his staff in less than two years on the job.</p><p>It was’t that long ago that the Panthers were winless in the ACC, and last season they weren’t really expected to beat anybody. This year is different, though, and looking around the ACC and looking at how the Panthers have played so far, the expectations should be higher for them.</p><p>The Panthers are not only better than they have been, the ACC is clearly weaker. And given the injuries that North Carolina has had in the past month, it has gotten even more so. Pitt isn’t likely to win 14 or 15 games in the ACC, but there are very few games that it can’t win and that is a far cry from where it has been in the recent past.</p><p>That’s especially true considering the Panthers have already played two games against two of the best teams in the conference, and they are 1-1. And their loss was on the road at Louisville, which was No. 1 in the country at the time, and they were in it until late when the Cardinals made a run to put the game away.</p><p>The top of the conference is still strong, but unlike last season, when it seemed like there were at least four teams who could win the national championship (and Virginia did win it) , I don’t know that there is a single team that is even a definite Final Four contender.</p><p>Duke, Louisville and Virginia are still a little bit out of Pitt’s league. I don’t expect Pitt to get blown out by any of them, but a Panthers win in those games would be a bit of a surprise.</p><p>Pitt beat Florida State in the opener at the Petersen Center and play the Seminoles again on the road. That’s another game I don’t expect them to win because Florida State is one of the best teams in the conference, and it is unlikely they are going to get swept by Pitt.</p><p>Add all of that up, and that is four games that I expect Pitt to lose, which would bring them to five conference losses. That leaves 14 conference games the Panthers have to play, and I defy you to find one that they shouldn’t be competitive in and have a chance to win.&nbsp;</p><p>At the start of the season, I thought an NIT bid was probably asking a lot of the young Panthers. Then after the Florida State win, I thought Pitt may be able to get to eight ACC wins this season, and that might be enough to put them in the NIT. Then I watched them play four Power 5 teams in late November and early December and win all four games, and my expectations got higher.</p><p>The other part of the equation, though, is the ACC has been very disappointing this year. I see four definite NCAA tournament teams and a whole lot of mediocrity. I see a conference that suddenly has opened up to some of the teams who were at the bottom of it. I thought when Capel was hired it would be tough for him to get into the top half of the league in his first two or even three years.</p><p>That was before I saw what has happened in the ACC. North Carolina is probably going to struggle to get to the NIT now. And teams like Miami, Notre Dame and Syracuse, which have made up the middle of the conference, are all struggling. I just don’t see nearly as tough of a path for the Panthers to get to 20-plus wins as I did at the beginning of the season.</p><p>Pitt is a young team and still is growing and learning, so there will be days the Panthers play poorly and lose games they could have won. But they are good enough and coached well enough to make a run at an NCAA tournament bid.</p><p>The Panthers have all the elements to be the kind of team that makes a big move from last season. They have great guards who are difficult to defend and who create offense. They have a defensive mindset. They play extremely hard and play without fear. They are also playing in a league that suddenly looks a lot more forgiving than we first thought.&nbsp;</p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/paul-zeise/2020/01/03/NCAA-Tournament-bid-isn-t-an-unrealistic-goal-for-Pitt-basketball-Paul-Zeise/stories/202001030116</original_url>
