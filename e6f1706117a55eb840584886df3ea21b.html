<p>A Derry Township woman was killed Monday morning by a bullet apparently fired from outside her home, according to State Police.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorities say that Tracy Marie Squib, 52, called 911 at around 4 a.m. in the bedroom of her Pandora Road home to report a wound in her chest. The wound was determined to be from a gunshot, one of multiple fired at her home from the outside as she slept, and she died shortly after being transported to a hospital.</p>
<p>Her death is being investigated as a homicide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re very saddened by what took place here.” State Trooper Steve Limani said at a press conference outside Ms. Squib’s home.&nbsp;“Right now we’re trying very hard to put the pieces together of what transpired here at this residence. It’s very early in our investigation.”</p>
<p>Trooper Limani said that three other people were sleeping inside the home when the incident occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also encouraged anyone with information, particularly others who live on Pandora Road, to report it to police at 724-832-3288.</p>
