<h1>Pirates fire about two dozen in large-scale restructuring</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When new leadership was hired this past offseason, the Pirates figured that eventually they would look to restructure the business side of the organization.</p>
<p>Just not this soon.</p>
<p>Multiple sources told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Thursday that the Pirates fired more than two dozen people, including several department heads, as part of a massive reorganization that was hastened by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Some of those affected have been with the club for decades, overseeing such things as business analytics, ticket sales and hospitality.</p>
<p>While one source said that "COVID probably expedited the process of evaluating staffing structure and job functions throughout the entire organization," the result became eliminating some positions and changing the responsibilities of others.</p>
<p>One source said the number affected was "believed to be around 25."</p>
<p>Those who were fired will receive full health care benefits, including the covering of employee contributions, at least through Oct. 31. Severance packages will be offered, although more details were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Thursday's moves are the latest in a series of responses to the pandemic and a lack of money coming in.</p>
<p>It's been a rough two months for all Major League Baseball teams with the regular season delayed to July 23 or 24 and the lack of fans taking away at least 40% of future revenue.</p>
<p>The Pirates on April 28 announced they were suspending 401(k) contributions and halting their fellowship and internship programs. That's also when members of the executive leadership team began taking voluntary salary reductions.</p>
<p>Less than a month later, on May 21, the Pirates announced they would furlough roughly 20% of their employees outside of baseball operations for an indefinite period of time starting on June 1.</p>
<p>Those furloughed continued to receive benefits for themselves and their families and were told they would be able to return whenever their job function allowed/required it.</p>
<p>Some of those fired on Thursday were furloughed employees who were told they would not be back.</p>
<p>The Pirates back in May also instituted pay reductions for remaining staffers, using a sliding scale from 5-25% depending on how much each employee made.</p>
<p>Ticket sales jobs were at least somewhat expected considering that it's unlikely MLB games this season will be played anywhere with fans in the stands.</p>
