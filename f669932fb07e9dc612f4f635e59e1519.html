<h1>Covestro to sell off part of former Bayer campus in Robinson</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Months before it finalizes its deal to buy the former Bayer headquarters in Robinson, Covestro is selling off part of the campus to a Moon developer.</p>
<p>Covestro confirmed Wednesday that it has reached an agreement to sell all of the property south of Bayer Road to DiCicco Development Inc.&nbsp;The transaction will include buildings 7, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 —&nbsp;more than 335,000 square feet of space in all. Terms have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, building 8 —&nbsp;a 150,000-square-foot space that houses Covestro’s polycarbonate and coatings, adhesives and specialties businesses —&nbsp;will be leased back to the company.</p>
<p>Buildings involved represent those on the side of Bayer Road not visible from the Parkway West, according to Covestro.</p>
<p>“The sale represents a positive step in the overall management of the site with DDI planning to aggressively search for new companies to occupy its property. DDI also plans to continue to share and enhance existing amenities with Covestro,” the company stated.</p>
<p>DiCicco representatives could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Covestro is scheduled to close on its purchase of the 260-acre Bayer campus at the end of December. That will be quickly followed by another closing involving its deal with DiCicco.</p>
<p>Last December, Covestro cut an agreement with Bayer to acquire the Robinson campus, which had been the German drugmaker’s North American headquarters for 60 years.</p>
<p>The purchase included 14 buildings.</p>
<p>Bayer decided to sell the property after announcing in January 2019 that it would shutter local operations as part of a corporate restructuring following its acquisition of Monsanto.</p>
<p>Covestro, formerly part of Bayer, spun off as an independent business in 2015 and currently leases space at the site.</p>
<p>Although Bayer has downsized its local presence in recent years, Covestro has grown to about 750 employees at the campus.</p>
<p>In announcing the purchase last year, Covestro noted that it did not need all the space and that it would be looking to use “the portion of the campus and assets that provide the highest value” and “divest those assets that aren’t relevant to us.”</p>
<p>Representing Covestro in the acquisition of the Bayer headquarters and in the sale of part of it to DiCicco were David Koch and E. Gerry Dudley, both executive vice presidents at the CBRE real estate firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Koch declined comment on Wednesday.</p>
<p>DiCicco has been a top developer in the Parkway West corridor, where it owns the Westpointe Corporate Center. The company recently purchased the 35.5-acre Baywood Conference Center in Moon that had been owned by Bayer for $1.7 million, according to Allegheny County real estate records.</p>
<p>It also has acquired the former Pittsburgh Post-Gazette building at 34 Boulevard of the Allies and an adjacent lot Downtown. It is planning to redevelop the building and add a new tower next to it.</p>
