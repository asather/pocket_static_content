<h1>Yet again, offense struggles as Pirates are swept by the Reds</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CINCINNATI — Entering the top of the ninth inning on Wednesday night, the Pirates faced a one-run deficit.</p>
<p>With a chance to end their series with the Cincinnati Reds on a high-note, left fielder Adam Frazier led off, gave a mighty swing and produced a sharp line out to left field. Third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes then weakly ground out to the pitcher, and designated hitter Colin Moran waved and missed at a ball in the dirt for the third out.</p>
<p>Thus ended a bad offensive night and series for the Pirates, who produced just six runs in 32 innings against the Cincinnati Reds over four games, striking out 45 times in the process en route to a four-game sweep.</p>
<p>For the eighth time in a row, the Pirates lost. This time, it was 1-0.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to be aggressive, but it has to be aggressive with contact,” manager Derek Shelton said after the game. “Part of it is our approach, 100 percent, not to shy away from that. And part of it’s, we’ve faced really good pitching the last four days even going back to the last day in KC, Keller threw the ball really well. Not only is it aggressive, but we have to have more contact to make things happen.”</p>
<p>Perhaps nobody exemplified the futility of the four-game series for the Pirates (14-34) better than catcher John Ryan Murphy. It would be an understatement to say he has struggled at the plate against the Reds. In his 12 plate appearances against Cincinnati this season, he struck out in all of them. That included an 0-for-2, two-strikeout performance on Wednesday, which ended when he was pinch-hit for by outfielder Bryan Reynolds in the top of the eighth.</p>
<p>Shortstop Erik Gonzalez, one of the more reliable bats in the Pirates’ lineup this season, finished 0-for-3 with three strikeouts. Second baseman Kevin Newman had two more himself. Right fielder Gregory Polanco extended his hitless streak to five games and now has two hits in his last 36 at-bats.</p>
<p>Basically, Reds starter Luis Castillo had his way with the Pirates, giving up just three hits — all singles — and lasting seven innings. That gave way to right-handed reliever Archie Bradley and closer Raisel Iglesias, and the Pirates found no answers against them, either.</p>
<p>The only real bright spots in the lineup were Hayes, who scalded a single into right in the first, and designated hitter Josh Bell, who did the same in the fourth, extending his current hitting streak to 10 games. Newman added another single, but that was all.</p>
<p>“I was there a couple weeks ago,” Bell said, referencing his own offensive struggles from earlier in the season. “It seems like every out feels like two or three, and you’re searching for hits instead of searching for quality at-bats, but all it takes is one to turn things around, and hopefully that starts tomorrow.”</p>
<p>It wasted a very good pitching performance from right-hander JT Brubaker, who allowed one run on five hits and struck out four Reds in 5.2 innings, and the Pirates’ bullpen, who gave up next to nothing. It was the first time since Aug. 30, and the fourth time all season, that the Pirates held an opponent to one run or fewer, but it still, somehow, was not enough.</p>
<p>Brubaker’s only blemish came in the fifth. After inducing two outs to start the inning, Jose Garcia and Curt Casali singled, eventually getting to second and third with savvy baserunning. Shogo Akiyama then singled to left field, scoring Garcia, but a quick throw in from left fielder Adam Frazier halted Casali in his tracks and caught Akiyama between first and second. Hayes turned, ran down Akiyama, then flipped around and caught Casali trying to sneak home to score, nabbing him at the plate to end the inning.</p>
<p>Other than that, Brubaker was very good. He mixed his sinker and slider well with his other pitches, getting whiffs on 33% of the Reds’ swings during his outing, and going tit-for-tat with the impressive Castillo.</p>
<p>“It was very enjoyable, just going out there, trying to make sure I wasn't the guy to give up that one run,” Brubaker said. “Unfortunately, I was. Just to see who gave up the run first was the enjoyable part of it. The battle between two starting pitchers, in my opinion, is the best part of baseball.”</p>
