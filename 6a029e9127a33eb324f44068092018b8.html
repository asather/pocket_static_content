<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Plum woman was charged with homicide by vehicle Thursday after she was involved in a fatal crash in White Oak last month, according to court documents.</p>
<p>Taylor Adams, 27, was responsible for the death of 59-year-old&nbsp;Donald Pivirotto of North Huntington, according to a police affidavit. Mr. Pivirotto died in a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2020/04/09/White-Oak-PA-car-accident-Jacks-Run-Road-police-investigating-crash/stories/202004090162?cid=search" target="_blank">crash on Jacks Run Road</a> on the afternoon of April 10.</p>
<p>Ms. Adams was driving a 2007 Isuzu box truck when she swerved into the opposing lane to avoid a vehicle that had stopped in front of her, the affidavit says. The maneuver put her in the path of oncoming traffic, and she hit Mr. Pivirotto head on.</p>
<p>According to the affidavit, a blood test showed Ms. Adams had used marijuana before the crash. She has been charged with three counts of driving under the influence and one count of homicide by vehicle while DUI.</p>
<p>The medical examinerâ€™s office said the cause of death for Mr. Pivirotto was blunt force trauma, and the manner was ruled accidental.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing for Ms. Adams is set for July 22.</p>
