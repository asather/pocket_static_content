<h1>Pitt football, ACC athletics suspended amid coronavirus concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt's Blue-Gold spring football game and the rest of the university's spring athletic calendar are in doubt.</p>
<p>The ACC announced Thursday afternoon that it suspended all athletic-related activities, including practices, games and recruiting, due to the spread of COVID-19, otherwise known as the coronavirus.</p>
<p>ACC commissioner John Swofford said the health and safety concerns marked “uncharted territory” and the decision was made to “protect from the further spread of COVID-19.” Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke supported the ACC's decision, releasing a statement shortly after.</p>
<p>“This decision was made with one priority in mind — the health and well-being of our student-athletes,” Lyke said. "We are very cognizant of the disappointment that may be felt by our young people who worked and prepared so hard for their seasons. However, this is an unprecedented circumstance and we must prioritize safety and responsibility in our response to it. The decision to indefinitely suspend all competition, practices and recruiting is one we fully support.</p>
<p>“Our administrators, staff and coaches will remain actively engaged with all of our student-athletes, ensuring their well-being during this time of suspended athletics activity and distance learning.”</p>
<p>This shift comes less than 24 hours after Pitt declared its home athletic events would proceed "as previously scheduled." The university announced Wednesday afternoon that it would extend its spring break to March 23 and transition to "distance learning" for the remainder of the semester. However, a university statement read: "Pitt athletics may continue its practice and competition regimen."</p>
<p>The spring game was on, and there were no fan restrictions. But that changed Thursday.</p>
<p>Now, it's uncertain whether or not Pitt football will have its annual scrimmage, scheduled for April 11 at Heinz Field. Unless the coronavirus concerns are quelled in a matter of days — which seems highly unlikely — the Panthers will not resume spring practice on Tuesday, as previously scheduled. Pat Narduzzi's squad was three practices in when Pitt's spring break started, and the team intended to have 12 more sessions, with the 15th being the spring game.</p>
<p>Narduzzi and his staff can't recruit in-person during this state of limbo, either. College football recruiting is currently in a “quiet period” until April 15, meaning recruits could take visits to college campuses. And from April 15 to May 31 is a scheduled “evaluation period,” allowing college coaches to visit prospects off campus. None of that will happen during the ACC's suspension.</p>
<p>A Pitt athletics spokesperson also told the Post-Gazette that Pitt's pro day — originally scheduled for March 18 — is “currently being evaluated.”</p>
