<h1>Obituary: Uniontown's Ron Sepic was great two-sport athlete and an 'Ed Sullivan Show' guest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was a really big show for a Western Pennsylvania high school basketball player, sharing the stage on a famous television show with another kid at the time named Lew Alcindor.</p>
<p>The year was 1963 and the Parade All-American high school basketball team was introduced live from New York on “The Ed Sullivan Show.” Teenage basketball players were brought onto the same stage where Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly had historic rock ’n’ roll performances. The final player to be introduced to a national TV audience was Alcindor, who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The second player introduced was Ron Sepic from Uniontown High School.</p>
<p>Fifty-seven years ago, a senior athlete from a WPIAL school was recognized as one of the top five players in the country. Sepic was good enough to make the same all-star team as Abdul-Jabbar, then a 7-foot sophomore from New York who would become an all-time great.</p>
<p>Sepic was a terrific basketball player but also one of the best two-sport athletes in the history of WPIAL sports. Sepic died of cancer at his Uniontown home on March 28. He was 75.</p>
<p>This fact tells everything about Sepic’s athletic ability: After playing basketball at Ohio State, Sepic was selected in both the NFL and NBA drafts.</p>
<p>“He was so highly talented in both sports,” said Don Yates, another Uniontown basketball great and former teammate of Sepic. “You know, I still have a picture of him on that ‘Ed Sullivan Show?’ That was a great, great honor.”</p>
<p>Sepic received many honors during his high school days. He played during a golden Uniontown era when the Raiders were annually among the best football and basketball teams in the WPIAL. As a senior, Sepic was a first-team all-state selection in both football and basketball.</p>
<p>“If you had a Mount Rushmore of Fayette County athletes, he’d be on it,” said George Von Benko, a longtime sports talk show host on WMBS radio in Uniontown and co-founder of the Fayette County Sports Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Sepic is a member of the Fayette Hall of Fame, but he also is in the WPIAL Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in October of last year.</p>
<p>As a Uniontown senior, Sepic helped the Raiders win a WPIAL football championship. Months earlier in March, when Sepic was a junior, he helped Uniontown win WPIAL and PIAA basketball championships. In basketball, Sepic was an anomaly. He was a 6-foot-5, 215-pound player who was a model of versatility.</p>
<p>“If you were 6-5, back in our day, you played center on the inside,” said Yates, who went on to play at the University of Minnesota. “Big players back then did not have the skill to move outside. But Ron had those skills. What made him such a good player is he could play so many different positions. His savvy and court vision were so good and that let him play inside and outside.”</p>
<p>As a senior in 1963, playing for legendary coach Abe Everhart, Sepic averaged 19.2 points a game for a team that was a heavy favorite to win another WPIAL title and possibly another PIAA championship. Uniontown headed into the WPIAL quarterfinals with a 36-game winning streak before losing to Norwin in what is considered one of the biggest upsets in WPIAL playoff history. Norwin featured 6-foot-9, 285-pound John Naponick who, along with Sepic, were the only WPIAL players to make first-team all-state in 1963.</p>
<p>Sepic was recruited by Division I colleges for both football and basketball, and Duke and West Virginia were his finalists. Legendary Ohio State football coach Woody Hayes wanted him for football and Sepic eventually chose the Buckeyes — for basketball.</p>
<p>Sepic played three years of basketball for the Buckeyes (freshmen weren’t eligible for varsity back then). He scored 1,107 points, averaged 15.4 points for his career and had double figures in points and rebounds in 19 games.</p>
<p>In 1967, the Washington Redskins selected Sepic in the 12th round of the NFL draft, even though Sepic never played a down of football at Ohio State. The Cincinnati Royals picked him in the ninth round of the NBA draft. Sepic ended up going to dental school instead and ran his own orthodontics practice for more than four decades in Uniontown before retiring in 2018. His son, Chris, of Farmington, took over the business.</p>
<p>“I never saw him play at Uniontown,” current Uniontown basketball coach Rod Kezmarsky said. “But I remember as a kid coming to watch some former Uniontown players in a basketball game against the Steelers. [Sepic] played and you could just see how good he was and I could only imagine how good he was in his prime. The thing about him, too, is that he was always a supporter of our program.”</p>
<p>Besides his son and wife of 54 years, Susan McMillan Sepic, Ron Sepic is survived by two other children, Ron Jr., of Hopwood, and Lynn Hime, of Morgantown, W.Va.; two sisters, Marlene Pensock and Patricia Thomas, of Uniontown; a brother, Melvyn Sepic, of Uniontown; and five grandchildren.</p>
