<h1>Mike White's high school sports chat transcript: 05.12.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Good morning, and good news. There are no high school sports, but there are certainly some notable things happening in WPIAL in past few days. Coaching changes, national federation voting down shot clock rule for basketball and WPIAL just released its new section alignments. Let's go. Fire away.</p>
<p><strong>Jojo</strong>: whats your thoughts on CC moving to a new section for boys basketball? seems odd. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Not at all. Some would say it's odd that Central played in the northern section for a lot of years. Now they are in a section with teams from the east, except Fox Chapel. Not odd at all. Over the years, Central has played in section with teams from east. So it's not odd. Plus, it's a good move for competitiveness. Let's face it, that section was proven to be very weak last season. And without Central, it would've had only five teams and been even weaker this season. So Central at least gives it a little more competitiveness. If you're going to have three section 6A, I think Central is now where it belongs, for a few reasons.</p>
<p><strong>littleschool</strong>: Some schools have been forced to move up a class for football and basketball. Is there also a path for them to move back down again. If so, what do they need to do in order to move back down. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: It's all based on school enrollment.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Have you heard anything about the Moon Girls Basketball coach search? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Have not.</p>
<p><strong>Todd</strong>: How in the world could the PIAA rule in favor of North Catholic’s girls team when it comes to the competitive balance formula? That school’s teams are made up of transfers every year. The students choose to go there each year, thus the students are transfers each year. The PIAA’s decision is a contradiction of its own rule. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: What? Never heard this absurd logic about "transfers." But North Catholic did not have a transfer the past two years. There was nothing for the PIAA to rule about. North Catholic had one player on its roster the past two years who wasn't on the previous season. But she was not a transfer. Case closed.</p>
<p><strong>Baller</strong>: Only 5 teams in the 6A north section for boys b-ball? 8 section games seems odd. How many teams from that section will make the playoffs? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: WPIAL exec. director Amy Scheuneman said board of directors will discuss playoff qualifiers at meeting next week. Look for it to stay at four and I'm good with that. The only thing is 6A girls. Class 6A girls had only two sections the past two years and will have only two again next season, while Class 6A boys has three. Next season, Class 6A boys will have 17 teams in three sections while Class 6A girls will have 15 teams in two sections. I really think WPIAL needs to change playoff qualifiers for 6A girls sections. Take five from each section. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: As for only five teams in Class 6A northern boys section ... If you're going to have three sections in 6A, one is going to have only five teams. It's not the first time the WPIAL has had a five team section. But I know there is concern among coaches and others in that five-team section about playing only eight section games. Do you know how hard it will be to get 14 non-section games? Basically 14 games that don't mean anything. Some in that section are asking to let them play 12 section games (play each team three times). I think it's a good idea. I've looked it up, in the past WPIAL has let five team sections play each team three times. I think it should be done again.</p>
<p><strong>Old guy</strong>: Avonworth hire was surprising. An in house assistant football coach with no Head-coaching experience. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well, everyone has to get their first head coaching job at some point. Mike Mancuso was hired at Avonworth last night. He's been an assistant at a few places and a football assistant. Was defensive coordinator for football team last year. He will give up football job. Why not give him a chance, if you believe in him? Plus, he's already a phys ed teacher in the district. So Avonworth didn't have to find him a teaching job.</p>
<p><strong>D9 Dave</strong>: What is it going to take to get the shot clock rule passed by the NFHS? Do you think PA should go ahead and at least put it to a vote and adopt it if passed at the state level? Are you in favor of a 35 second clock or something else? It's the way the game is played nowadays and the majority of players, coaches, and fans I believe would like to see it. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I am certainly in favor of a 35-second shot clock. I think it would be fun. People come up with drawbacks. Cost is one of them. But nine other states make it work. I think most coaches want it also. I do think it would hurt teams that are not as talented as their opponent, but overall it would be good for the game. PIAA could adopt it if they really wanted, but they are going by the notion that they follow NFHS rules.</p>
<p><strong>5A Fanatic</strong>: Thoughts on New Castle moving up to 5A in the boys bracket? If I recall they have most of their team returning. Are you aware of the other teams in 5A that will contend with them to win the WPIAL? Thanks. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: New Castle will be very good in 5A. They would be good in any classification. As for rest of 5A, Mars should still be pretty good. Number of kids return. Laurel Highlands still has Rodney Gallagher. And Penn Hills will still be very good. And don't forget Highlands won WPIAL 4A and moves up to 5A, although Highlands lost its top players.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Has NA hired a new boys basketball coach yet? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Any chance Lincoln Park wins their appeal. It is a complete joke that they are even appealing. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I have a better chance of winning Power Ball than Lincoln Park has of winning appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Pants</strong>: For sections with unbalanced number of teams, it's unfair to have same number of playoff spots for sections with 7 and 6 in the same class, right? Is there anyway around that? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No, it's not unfair. You're not going to have the same number of teams in all sections. Can <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: To continue with previous answer, it's not unfair. You can't have equal number of teams in sections when there is odd number of teams in class. And c'mon. Four teams from each section make the playoffs? FOUR!!!! If you can't make it with four, please don't cry it's not fair.</p>
<p><strong>The Ham</strong>: any predictions on where Davis and Ford will choose to play CFB? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No predictions from me yet.</p>
<p><strong>Be Like Mike White</strong>: Sending New Castle to that section seems odd don’t ya think? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well where else would you put them? No matter where you put New Castle in 5A, it's not going to be good. True, if they played in Section 4, Mars would be closer for them. But Section 4 has Armstrong, Highlands, Indiana, Plum. You really want New Castle to travel to those places. New Castle's section has Char Valley, Moon, South Fayette, Trinity, West A. Not optimum, but most of them they can come right down I-79. Section 1 has Al Gallatin, Connellsville, Laurel Highlands. Can't put New Castle there. Section 3 is full of teams in east. That would be horrible travel. So where do you want them to go?</p>
<p><strong>Hooper</strong>: Any news on NA boys coaching position? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: Any word when baseball sections will be announced. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Some time soon.</p>
<p><strong>tad</strong>: suprised north catholic girls moved down to 3a, i understand its due to enrollment but they will reload as always, figured they would play up to "compete" in 4a, any thoughts on if anyone will stop their reign? history says no <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: North Catholic will always be competitive. But you do know they started five seniors this year, right? They will most certainly not be the same next season. And look, they are in section with defending WPIAL 3A champ Mohawk, and also Laurel, which was in Class 2A final this year. Both of those teams were also young. Laurel started three freshmen. Mohawk started only one senior. So North Catholic will definitely get some competition in its new section.</p>
<p><strong>Pants</strong>: Best thing you mentioned is 6A girls should have more playoff teams. Last year 50% of 6A girls teams made playoffs (8/16) yet 12/18 from 6A boys for 66%. That's way out of balance, and hope the WPIAL changes it! <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I agree. If you're going to take 12 in 6A boys with 17 teams, you can't take only eight in 6A girls with 15 teams.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong>: For all the NA boys questions, as of right now, AD Bob Bozzuto has not placed anything in the board agenda for tomorrow’s board meeting. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Tomorrow's meeting is a work session/special meeting. Next week's meeting is a regular meeting. I think that's when hiring would take place.</p>
<p><strong>mwheat</strong>: you do know north catholic is a private school right? and one of their stud seniors tranferred in? they will just reload, they should have moved up to 5A, sad! <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Good golly! No, I never knew North Catholic was a private school. So insightful of you to point that out. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Tjfan</strong>: Mike, what’s your thoughts on high school football starting? I don’t see how it will happen, if nfl and college end up playing without fans, pretty sure high school will not follow. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I quit making predictions on what will happen in football. Let's just wait until maybe late June and look at things then.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy the Greek</strong>: So, Pine has it’s Board meeting on Monday the 18th &amp; NA’s the 20th. Prediction- Pine gets it’s top guy, NA may not due to dragging it’s feet <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Very doubtful Pine will have a hire by board meeting. Will probably take longer, although I have been told that some who applied at NA will also apply at Pine-Richland.</p>
<p><strong>Tony from USC</strong>: Mike, I enjoy reading content from many different local publications. From the PG, Trib, Observer-Reporter, Beaver County Times and others. If you could add one high school writer to the PG’s team, who would it be and why? Just a nice hypothetical for your Tuesday. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Bob Smizik.</p>
<p><strong>Tjfan</strong>: Football in spring, baseball in fall. Pennsylvania baseball starts in March anyway. Weather isn’t great. Could be a consideration. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: That has been talked about. But I don't see why you can't start baseball in May anyway and play through early to mid July. Why not? Because of weather around here, not many teams play many game before early April anyway. And these times call for adjustments. So let's adjust. Start baseball late and play until mid-July. Iowa does it. Build it and they will come. I hope we don't have to have high school football in March and April, but it is intriguing thought.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Mike if I can pose a hypothetical for you, which two teams from different years do you think would be a great hoops matchup? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Schenley 2007 team vs. Fifth Avenue 1976 or Schenley 1971.</p>
<p><strong>Tjfan</strong>: it will be very interesting to see, what kids are working? What’s kids aren’t? Will be a very interesting season either way. Being on lockdown, you can gain weight and be out of shape, or you can go the other way. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Some football teams are having "optional" workouts for players from their homes on video. Using Zoom or Google Meets, etc. I think that's great. Some teams are giving kids workout programs to do on their own.</p>
<p><strong>Mike in BP</strong>: Favorite Frank Costanza moment? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Never watched much of Seinfeld. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well that's about it for now. Will talk a little more high school sports with P-G buddies Ron Cook and Joe Starkey on their show at noon. Everyone, be good.</p>
