<h1>Auditor General calls for change to state's charter school law after review of PA Cyber, Lincoln Park</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale called upon the state General Assembly on Wednesday to reform Pennsylvania’s charter school law after his review of Lincoln Learning Solutions’ recent tax filings.</p>
<p>A statement from Mr. DePasquale’s office said that his findings revealed LLS’s nearly $82 million fund balance in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, along with a myriad of other concerns of how the charter management company spent its money.</p>
<p>LLS manages Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School and Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School in Midland, Beaver County. The schools receive millions of tax dollars each year. Based on state Department of Education data from 2018, the two schools have a combined enrollment of 11,000 students.</p>
<p>LLS, which is registered as a nonprofit organization, is almost entirely funded by public sources, according to Mr. DePasquale, but Pennsylvania’s charter school law prevents both the state’s auditor general and Department of Education from performing full reviews of charter management companies’ books, meaning that the money they receive cannot be fully tracked.</p>
<p>“At a time when school districts are facing enormous revenue shortfalls, taxpayers deserve to know exactly where their money is going,” Mr. DePasquale said. “The General Assembly should revisit Pennsylvania’s charter school law — which I believe is the worst in the nation — to make sure our limited education funding is not being diverted to benefit private companies.”</p>
<p>In 2019, Mr. DePasquale requested financial documents from LLS to determine how it spent the taxpayer money it received. According to his office, Mr. DePasquale then initiated a review of the company’s public Form 990 tax filings from the 2014 to 2018 fiscal years.</p>
<p>Within those filings, Mr. DePasquale found an $81.8 million reserve fund in LLS’s 2017-2018 fiscal year, which was tens of millions of dollars more than the reserve funds of any other charter management company that was similarly reviewed.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to Mr. DePasquale’s findings, LLS communications director Christina Zarek said the reserve fund to which the auditor general refers consists of company assets, which they use for employee salaries and benefits, monthly bills and operating expenses.</p>
<p>“Most of our funds are utilized for infrastructure, technology and curriculum development and&nbsp;delivery for students in Pennsylvania and elsewhere,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Later in his report, Mr. DePasquale said that some executives at LLS received large pay increases during that four-year period, with board president and CEO Robert Clements receiving a 50% pay raise. Then-chief financial officer James Livingstone received a 148% pay raise between the 2014-2015 fiscal year and the 2017-2018 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Mr. DePasquale also found that LLS reported spending over $622,000 on lobbying at the Pennsylvania General Assembly and other state legislatures during that same four-year time frame.</p>
<p>A similar review of other Pennsylvania charter management companies’ 990 tax filings showed that none reported spending any money on lobbying between their 2014-2018 fiscal years.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is absolutely imperative that the charter school law be updated to allow for greater transparency about where our tax dollars are going,” Mr. DePasquale said. “As recipients of public funds, charter school management organizations should operate under the same level of accountability that we expect of our school districts.”</p>
<p>LLS’s statement refuted Mr. DePasquale’s concerns with these findings, however.</p>
<p>“As far as our executives’ salaries are concerned, they are in line with their education,&nbsp;experience and responsibilities.” the statement said. “Mr. Livingstone received a raise because he was promoted from within the finance department to Chief Financial Officer.”</p>
<p>The company’s statement also notes that some of LLS’s contracts to which Mr. DePasquale referred have expired since his initial inquiry, including the marketing and lobbying contract with PA Cyber and its services contract with Lincoln Park PACS.</p>
