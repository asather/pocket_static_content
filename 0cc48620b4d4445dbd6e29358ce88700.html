<h1>After playing its best game against Saint Louis, Duquesne hopes to carry momentum</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Duquesne’s win over Saint Louis on Wednesday was probably its best game of the season.</p>
<p>Dukes coach Keith Dambrot thinks so, too. In fact, on Friday, he thought back on his three seasons with Duquesne and could only come up with a short list of games that rival Wednesday’s performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His two nominees were the Dukes’ 68-64 loss at Dayton and their 65-61 loss at Davidson, both in 2019. The major difference, of course, is that this time Duquesne won, beating the Billikens, 82-68, a team that is vying for the top four in the Atlantic 10 alongside the Dukes.</p>
<p>“Our coaching staff talked after the game, and I thought that that Saint Louis game was a culmination of two and a half years of work for us,” Dambrot said.&nbsp;“To go on the road with a good crowd and finish the job. Now, we’ve been close before, but we’ve never finished the job. There’s no secret to this. You’ve just got to keep putting time in, keep working, keep getting better players, never give up, never believe what people say — that you can’t win at Duquesne — and just keep fighting like a dog.</p>
<p>“Eventually, if you keep working, and you don’t give up, and you get good enough players, there’s no reason you can’t win. But that was two and a half years of work to get to that point. Now, we were good enough to beat some of the marginal teams, but finally we beat a good team on the road.”</p>
<p>The formula for doing so may not be entirely repeatable. Junior forward Marcus Weathers drew nine fouls and shot 13 free throws. Sophomore guard Sincere Carry had 14 points, eight assists and no turnovers. Junior forward Michael Hughes had five steals and three blocks. While all three of them have been key, solid contributors all season, it would be a tough ask to expect them to repeat those games in the future.</p>
<p>What might be repeatable, though, is the depth of the Dukes’ efforts on Wednesday. Dambrot played 10 different players against Saint Louis — some for as few as two minutes, but 10 players nonetheless. Some contributed a lot, some contributed a little, and some didn’t get much at all on the stat sheet.</p>
<p>But it was the realization of what Dambrot said he wanted to do more after Duquesne beat La Salle last Saturday.</p>
<p>“There’s two parts. I think we won a lot of games at Akron because at the end of the game, most people were playing eight and we were playing 10 and 11,” said Dambrot, who coached the Zips from 2004-2017.&nbsp;“So at the end of the game, our better players were fresher than their better players.</p>
<p>“And then the second part of it is, in order to win, you’ve got to have great team camaraderie, and when you’re only playing seven or eight guys, it’s difficult to have great team camaraderie because those guys don’t feel part of it. ... When you lose, it’s not hard to get guys in the game because you’ve got to make changes. When you’re winning, it’s a lot harder to make a lot of changes. But you’ve got to fight your resistance to it.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, the Dukes welcome St. Bonaventure on Saturday, a team tied with Duquesne for third in the conference standings. It isn’t a road game, so it isn’t exactly like the Saint Louis matchup, but it presents another step in Dambrot’s quest to bring the Dukes to prominence.</p>
<p>The Billikens are an extremely physical team. The Bonnies play a more finessed style. But, as Dambrot puts it, the best teams can win no matter the style of game that comes their way.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that Duquesne plays as well as it did against Saint Louis. No team can replicate the best performances night-in and night-out. But simply beating St. Bonaventure would place the Dukes alone in third place in the A10, and it might prove another step in the right direction for the team outlook as a whole.</p>
