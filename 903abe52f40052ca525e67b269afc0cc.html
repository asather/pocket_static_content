<p>For a second straight day, there are zero new deaths from COVID-19 in Allegheny County, according to the latest data released Monday, although the county said that figure should be treated cautiously.</p>
<p>“For full transparency, the reporting of no additional deaths today and yesterday may be due to a delay in reporting for the weekend,” the county health department said in a release.&nbsp;“ACHD reports data as soon as it is received but is uncertain at this time whether deaths have occurred this weekend but have not yet been reported.”</p>
<p>Statewide, the case count eclipsed the 50,000 mark, but there were only 14 new deaths reported. Eleven of them occurred at nursing or assisted living facilities.</p>
<p>The only county in Western Pennsylvania to report a death was Westmoreland, where its coroner reported one.&nbsp;Of Westmoreland’s 31 deaths, the office said 17 were female and 14 were male. All of the victims were white.</p>
<p>Allegheny County reported 20 new cases of COVID-19. With the new data, Allegheny County has 1,365 total cases and 102 deaths&nbsp;since the first case was announced on March 14.</p>
<p>Of the cases, 1,310 are confirmed and 55 are probable. Of the deaths, 92 are confirmed and 10 are probable. The county also said 194 cases — or 14% of the total cases —&nbsp;represent healthcare workers.</p>
<p>Allegheny County has the highest totals in Western Pennsylvania. Through Monday, there have been 238 hospitalizations in the county.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health said Monday&nbsp;that it had 50,092 cases COVID-19 and 2,458 deaths. Philadelphia continues to have the highest totals in the state with 13,316 cases and 424 deaths.</p>
