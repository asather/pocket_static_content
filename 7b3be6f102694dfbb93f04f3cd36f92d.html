<h1>COVID-19 quarantine can impact health even if there's no diagnosis, advocates say</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After weeks of staying home, postponing routine medical checkups and neglecting diets and exercise regimens, people’s health will suffer even if they never get a COVID-19 diagnosis.</p>
<p>As a result, health care consumers — individual families and the employers who offer workers insurance plans —&nbsp;are liable to see health care costs go up next year, two health experts say.</p>
<p>“Workers who have been furloughed are coming right back to your insurance, and they are going to cost a lot more money,” said Jordan Taradash, CEO of Spark360, a Cincinnati-based online health technology company.</p>
<p>That’s because quarantining has its own side effects, he said, ranging from a marked decrease in ambulatory medical visits to poorly managed chronic illnesses to an increase in overdose deaths.</p>
<p>Rather than blame the statewide shutdown order, Mr. Taradash and co-presenter Dr. Zane Gates said the real culprit is a bureaucratic and costly health care cost structure that encourages overuse. The pandemic is only bringing that underlying problem into sharper focus.</p>
<p>“We think there’s a better solution,” said&nbsp;Dr. Gates, chief medical officer for Empower 3 Center for Health, which has offices in Altoona, Murrysville and Johnstown.</p>
<p>Empower 3, he said, uses a direct-pay primary care structure where, for a negotiated fee, most routine care and screenings are covered without added deductible, co-payment or co-insurance costs.</p>
<p>While not new, the direct-pay model has been gaining traction as employers and consumers press for better value in their health care spending.</p>
<p>Direct-pay models are meant to eliminate much of the time spent and costs incurred from administrative billing and other tasks, with the goal of allowing physicians to spend more time with patients, focus on preventive care and the patient’s well-being —&nbsp;and lowering the cost of that care.</p>
<p>The two spoke in an online discussion Thursday to employer-members of the Pittsburgh Business Group on Health, which advocates for high-quality low-cost health care.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Mr. Taradash likened the direct-pay approach to the cost structure for auto insurance. Auto insurance will not cover routine maintenance such as replacing tires or getting an oil change. Instead, premium rates are based on covering the unpredictable, such as a serious car crash.</p>
<p>By including routine care in insurance costs, health insurance premium costs have increased an average 54% in 10 years, he said.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>“This is not a policy problem. It’s a math problem.”</p>
