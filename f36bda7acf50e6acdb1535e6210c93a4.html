<h1>Two PPS board members seek more transparency from school police</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two Pittsburgh Public Schools board members are seeking more information on interactions between students and police inside of city schools.</p>
<p>Board members Devon Taliaferro and Pam Harbin introduced a resolution during a school board meeting Wednesday calling on the district to release student arrest data to the public and form a community task force to&nbsp;“reimagine school safety.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s time that we really do what it takes to make sure that we are able to provide transparent data and information about areas which relate to our students as well as to be able to open up for community conversation,” Ms. Taliaferro said during a videoconference board meeting. “I’m happy to put forth this resolution today to be able to start that conversation and truly reimagine how we deliver school safety to our students, staff and the community.”</p>
<p>The resolution was the result of momentum generated by nationwide calls for police reform that has grown since a Minneapolis officer killed George Floyd in May. School districts in several large cities — including Minneapolis, Seattle and Denver — have suspended or cut ties with police.</p>
<p>The entry of the resolution comes after two days of public testimony before the school board in which community members addressed the topic of policing in schools and the possible removal of officers from district buildings. Dozens of people spoke in support of the Pittsburgh Public Schools’ police officers, but many also advocated for the district to get rid of its officers.</p>
<p>The resolution introduced by Ms. Taliaferro and Ms. Harbin does not ask&nbsp;for the removal of police officers, but it seeks “transparency and accountability” from the district’s department of safety.</p>
<p>The resolution requests that data collected by the district for the federal Department of Education&nbsp;Office of Civil Rights from the 2015-16 school year through the 2019-20 school year — as well as future years — is posted on the Pittsburgh Public Schools website.</p>
<p>That data includes the total number of students arrested, referred to police or issued a summary citation in each school, broken down by race, age, sex, disability and language proficiency.</p>
<p>In addition to the data release, the resolution seeks the formation of a community-majority task force on school safety.</p>
<p>The task force would lead&nbsp;listening sessions with school administrators, teachers, parents and students at schools with officers&nbsp;to identify and prioritize their needs; conduct a full review of the school safety manual including the role of officers, security guards and&nbsp;school safety practices; evaluate the effectiveness of safety practices; and recommend strategies for enhancing student safety and well-being through&nbsp;additional supports.</p>
<p>The board did not decide when it will vote on the resolution.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools employs 20 police officers who are unarmed but have arresting powers.</p>
<p>Advocates for school safety reform in Pittsburgh point to the fact that Black students are disproportionately arrested or referred to police compared with white students. They say the district should shift toward restorative justice initiatives, such as increased mental health services, in an effort to end the school-to-prison pipeline.</p>
<p>Ms. Harbin said this was not a time when the school board can afford to be passive and allow “oppressive systems for Black, brown and disabled students” to continue without change.</p>
<p>“There is no way that I am willing to sit back and say that I’m going to allow these systems to continue to occur without trying to disrupt them and to transform the systems,” she said.&nbsp;“I don’t believe it’s time for small changes. I believe it’s time for&nbsp;… deep thinking about what we can do differently.”</p>
