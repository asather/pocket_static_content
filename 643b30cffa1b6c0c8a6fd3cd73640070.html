<h1>Nova to sell stake in Texas chemicals venture</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nova Chemicals said it will sell its 50% stake in petrochemicals joint venture Novealis Holdings to its partner, Borealis, an Austria-based chemicals company.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Nova and Borealis formed the joint venture in 2018 and Novealis subsequently entered a venture deal with Total S.A. to create Bayport Polymers in Houston, Texas.</p>
<p>Bayport’s operations include an ethane steam cracker and polyethylene plants.</p>
<p>Nova, a Calgary, Canada-based plastics maker, has about 250 employees at an executive center in Moon, and 200 at a plant in Monaca, Beaver County.</p>
<p>Reports surfaced last year that Nova’s owner, Mubadala Investment of the United Arab Emirates, was exploring options including a sale of Nova.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that Chevron Phillips Chemical made an offer for the company which Nova declined to confirm.</p>
<p>Nova’s sale of its joint venture stake to Borealis is expected to close in the first half of 2020.</p>
