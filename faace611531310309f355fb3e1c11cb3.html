<h1>Pine-Richland's Rottinghaus family has rare perspective on pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The last name Rottinghaus is a big one in the Western Pennsylvania field hockey community.</p>
<p>Molly was a standout at Pine-Richland who now plays at Boston University.</p>
<p>Her sister, Ella, now stars for the Rams and was a Post-Gazette co-player of the year as a junior last fall when she led her team to a WPIAL championship.</p>
<p>Like all of us, the two have had to adjust to a different way of living due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Molly and Ella’s vantage point is different than most, though — their father is among those leading the charge in the fight against the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Talk to Dr. Dave Rottinghaus, and he comes across as a friendly, down-to-earth, humble guy. He’s also a giant among local health care professionals, as he serves as the chief medical officer of Butler Health System.</p>
<p>“Pittsburgh, as a community, I think has responded very well in terms of what has been asked of them,” Rottinghaus said. “There have been some tough decisions made for suspending businesses, and even churches and gatherings. ... I think Pittsburgh has done a really good job. I think we’ll see the impact of that.”</p>
<p>Life has changed so much in recent weeks for the Rottinghaus family. In March, Molly was in Florida for spring break, having some fun as she prepared for the stretch run of her sophomore year. Ella was getting ready for track season. She ran a leg on Pine-Richland’s 1,600-meter relay team that placed second at the WPIAL championships last year. They are now both at their parents’ home in Pine Township, along with their mom and two younger siblings, taking the necessary precautions for not obtaining or spreading the virus. That means keeping some distance between them and their dad, as well.</p>
<p>“He’s the chief medical officer, so he does a lot of administrative work, but he’s also in the emergency room working with patients,” Ella said. “When he started seeing people with [the coronavirus], he started to sleep in the basement. It’s been different.”</p>
<p>Dave Rottinghaus has developed a routine. When he comes home from work, he goes to the basement, showers, puts on some fresh clothes and does his laundry separate from the rest of his family’s. The nights end with him sleeping in the basement, but he hasn’t totally sheltered himself from his family. Far from it actually.</p>
<p>“We eat dinner together and are still spending time together in the same room, doing things like that,” said Margee, Dave Rottinghaus’ wife of 22 years. “But we’re not hugging him and we’re practicing social distancing at home.”</p>
<p>Back to the eating dinner part. There has been a change there, too, but not necessarily a bad one.</p>
<p>“I normally clear things off the kids’ plates when they’re done eating. Now, when I touch things, they become mine. That comes with its advantages when it’s something that is very good,” Dave Rottinghaus said, laughing.</p>
<p>Dave and Margee have four children — Molly, 20, Ella, 17, John, 15, and Georgia, 13. John is a ninth grader who plays football at Pine-Richland. Georgia is following in the footsteps of her sisters and playing field hockey. The family also has a 2-year-old English yellow lab named Hope, who Molly says “keeps us all sane.”</p>
<p>The family celebrated Molly’s 20th birthday April 4, which they said was fun, but likely would have been spent much differently if it had come a month earlier. The family kept it simple, going for a hike and ordering takeout for dinner.</p>
<p>“My family has been doing a lot of weekend hikes,” said Molly, who majors in nutritional sciences. “It’s been good and bad to be home. It’s harder with courses online. It’s harder staying on a schedule. I’m lucky to have my sister here to work out together and still pass the ball around.”</p>
<p>The sisters try to keep their field hockey skills sharp by practicing in the driveway. They recently ordered a piece of turf and a pop-up net they hope will help out.</p>
<p>Sports are big in the Rottinghaus family, and that goes way back. Dave and his two brothers played college football, Dave at Bowling Green. Margee’s sister played field hockey at Kent State and her father played football at Toledo. He has been a football coach for close to 50 years.</p>
<p>The family wonders, like the rest of us, how the pandemic will affect sports this fall. It will be Ella’s senior season at Pine-Richland.</p>
<p>“I really hope that we have a regular season. It’s very important to me with it being my senior year,” said Ella, who has already verbally committed to Boston University. “I really hope it happens, but I’m not sure. It starts in August. Hopefully we do whatever we can to have a season.”</p>
<p>Dave Rottinghaus remains hopeful that the fall season won’t be affected much, but did say that even if sports are played, they might not look the same.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of things will take on a different look,” he said. “I’m not sure we’re going to be able to pack stadiums. There’s nothing better than watching your kid play a sport or whatever their talent is. You love seeing what your kid loves to do. I think this year will take on a different appearance. Maybe it will be the attendance.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping the season goes on. Sports are a big part of life in Western Pennsylvania. When those decisions are made, I trust the people making those decisions to do it in the best interests of everyone.”</p>
