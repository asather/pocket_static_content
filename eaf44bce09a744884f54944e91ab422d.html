<h1>Highmark partners with referral network to help those facing food, housing crises</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Highmark Inc., Allegheny Health Network and Gateway Health are partnering with Aunt Bertha, a Texas-based online social care referral network, to help people facing a food shortage, a housing crisis or transportation.</p>
<p>The Aunt Bertha directory has geographic-specific information on social service agencies and community-based organizations throughout the U.S., including COVID-19-specific services.</p>
<p>The directory can be found at any of three Highmark Health websites: Medical and Community Resources page at HighmarkAnswers.com, AHN.org/coronavirus or GatewayHealthPlan.com/coronavirus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service is free and there are no income restraints, nor is the service restricted to Highmark members.</p>
<p>Highmark Health spokesman Dan Onorato said the partnership was already in the works before the COVID-19 outbreak but “at this critical time, we understood the importance of fast-tracking our implementation of the Aunt Bertha tool.”</p>
