<h1>Developer who illegally removed asbestos from former Westinghouse facility in Churchill sentenced</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Vikas Jain, who in 2017 used a crew of undocumented Guatemalan immigrants to illegally remove and dispose of asbestos from buildings on the former Westinghouse research property in Churchill that he owned, was sentenced Wednesday in federal court to one month of imprisonment, followed by three years of probation that includes nine months of home&nbsp;detention.</p>
<p>Mr. Jain, 48, a residential and commercial real estate developer who resides in Mt. Lebanon, pled guilty in October 2019 to knowningly violating federal Clean Air Act regulations.</p>
<p>Those violations stemmed from allegations by Churchill and Allegheny County Health Department enforcement officers that more than 130,000 square feet of asbestos floor tile and pipe insulation from two buildings was removed and disposed of by untrained workers who were not provided with protective clothing or breathing masks when grinding and handling the asbestos material.</p>
<p>The multi-million dollar redevelopment project, for which Mr. Jain had secured a $3.5 million state grant commitment, was shut down by the health department in May 2017 after Mr. Jain allegedly tried to cover up the violations and destroy evidence. A $1.5 million fine — the largest asbestos-related financial penalty in county history — is under appeal.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Joy Flowers Conti, imposed the sentence, which was much less than the 12 to 18 months of imprisonment suggested by federal guidelines, or the six to nine months requested by the U.S. Attorney’s office. She said the imprisonment, which can be served either in community confinement or home detention, would not begin until after Sept. 1, to allow time for the COVID-19 pandemic to abate.</p>
<p>The criminal violation of the federal Clean Air Act carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in jail, a fine of between $5,500 and $55,000 and restitution for potential victims.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Olshan told the court that his office was seeking&nbsp;“significant incarceration” because Mr. Jain was aware since 2012 that asbestos was a problem at the former Westinghouse reearch and technology park, but used untrained, unprotected, undocumented workers to accomplish its removal. He said Mr. Jain then took “active steps to&nbsp;mislead couny officials about what had happened.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The reason incarceration is apropriate in this case,” Mr. Olshan said,&nbsp;“is this is a college graduate who also attended medical school and was a successful businessman, who had a choice (whether) to break the law and then cover it up.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Jain’s attorney, Michael Leahey, requested no imprisonment of his client, instead suggesting probation or home confinement because he cares for his sick mother and has paid $500,000 to legally remediate the asbestos from one of the Westinghouse buildings and is in the process of spending a similar amount to abate asbestos problems in the second building, both of which he has sold at a financial loss.</p>
<p>Mr. Leahey said his client, who hs no prior criminal history, has “learned from this,” accepted resposibility and deserveds a second chance.</p>
<p>“I know I was wrong and should have been more responsible,” Mr. Jain told he judge as he choked back tears and his father, wife and two children looked on.&nbsp;“I will make sure I never again do something so out of character for me.”</p>
<p>He said he bit off more than he could chew as a developer in purchasing the sprawling, 135-acre Westinghouse campus and its seven buildings.</p>
<p>“I know how to do single family housing,” Mr. Jain said. “A lot of people are depending on me, and if you give me a chance I can rebuild myself. I can do it one house at a time.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judge Conti, who did not impose a fine, said the “modest” imprisonment term was warranted as a deterent and by the possible health harm caused to the workers and community from airborne asbestos, a known cancer-causing material.</p>
<p>“The imprisonment was appropriate because of the risk you put others in, particularly the workers,” the judge said.&nbsp;“The low range variance was appropriate because of the cleanup work and application of family resources to do it.”</p>
<p>She cited letters of suport from Mr. Jain’s tenants, contained in Mr. Leahey’s sentencing memorandum, as “touching and meaningful,”&nbsp; and said she believed he had “learned his lesson.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asbestos, a naturally occurring mineral, was once extensively used as insulation, a variety of flame retardant building materials, a cement additive, and ironically, cigarette filters.</p>
<p>Homes and buildings built before 1980 almost all contain asbestos. It is classified as a hazardous air pollutant and a carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>Prolonged exposure and inhalation of airborne asbestos fibers, especially worker exposure, can cause asbestosis, a serious and often fatal respiratory disease, lung cancers, and mesothelioma, a rare cancer that occurs in the lungs, abdomen and around the heart, and is almost always related to asbestos exposure.</p>
