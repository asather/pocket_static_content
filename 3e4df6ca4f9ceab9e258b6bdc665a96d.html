<h1>Pittsburgh Public Schools looks to commission school police data analysis</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools plans to hire a research organization to conduct an analysis that will match district police statistics with educational data.</p>
<p>The district said Wednesday night it selected&nbsp;RMC Research Corporation to prepare an&nbsp;analysis that should help the district not only understand the number of police calls, arrests and citations but also the characteristics and location of students facing those actions over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>“When it comes to taking the student educational data and putting it into the police data, that’s not something that is typically done because it’s not actually part of the juvenile record,” Ted Dwyer, the district’s chief accountability officer, said during a board meeting. “So what we’re doing is going an extra step to disaggregate the information in another way.”</p>
<p>The district said it chose RMC out of more than 30 research and evaluation firms that applied for the job.&nbsp;The district’s contract with RMC will be up for approval before the school board next week.</p>
<p>The analysis the district is seeking is separate from a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/06/24/Pittsburgh-Public-Schools-board-transparency-police-officers-district-safety/stories/202006240146" target="_blank">resolution introduced earlier this summer</a> by two board members who asked for more transparency from school police in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>But the district wants the analysis to provide information similar to what the resolution introduced by board members Devon Taliaferro and Pam Harbin had requested, such as data disaggregated by&nbsp;gender, grade, age, race, English language proficiency, economic standing and individual education plan status.</p>
<p>Mr. Dwyer said the district is not yet able to track that data on a live basis, but plans are in the works to create that process.</p>
<p>In a statement, Superintendent Anthony Hamlet acknowledged a report released Monday by the Black Girls Equity Alliance group that revealed African American students in Allegheny County continue to be referred to the juvenile justice system at a much higher rate than white children. The report also pointed to the Pittsburgh Public Schools as the largest source of referrals for Black girls in the county.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamlet said the report shows why the district needs the data analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This report reveals alarming truths to the systemic inequities affecting Black youth in our region and the racial disproportionality in referrals to the juvenile justice system,” Mr. Hamlet said. “We look forward to the results of this thorough data analysis that will help us better understand the sources and causes of inequitable juvenile justice engagements.”</p>
<p>The resolution Ms. Taliaferro and Ms. Harbin put forth in June asked for the release of school police data, but it also went further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The resolution called for the formation of a&nbsp;community-majority task force on school safety, which&nbsp;would hold listening sessions with school administrators, teachers, parents and students; conduct a review of the school safety manual, including the role of officers and security guards; as well as perform other duties.</p>
<p>It is unclear when the board will vote on the resolution, but Ms. Harbin said she planned for it to be in September’s legislative agenda.&nbsp;</p>
