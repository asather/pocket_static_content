<h1>Facial recognition bill to be introduced at county council</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A bill almost mirroring the city’s new regulations on facial recognition and surveillance tools used by law enforcement will be introduced in Allegheny County Council Tuesday.</p>
<p>Council members Bethany Hallam, D-at large, and Olivia Bennett, D-Northview Heights, are sponsors of the legislation.</p>
<p>If enacted, the ordinance would require County Council approval of the acquisition or use of surveillance and facial recognition tools by law enforcement except in emergency situations.</p>
<p>"It's about the fact that this data is being collected without people knowing and there's no oversight,” Ms. Hallam said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Hallam said she’s concerned about people being at risk for false identification, arrests and convictions based on the technology.</p>
<p>A 2019 U.S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology study that tested 189 software algorithms from 99 software developers found that false positives happened at higher rates among African American and Asian faces than white faces. The researchers found higher rates of false positives among Black females. The institute’s stated mission is to promote U.S. innovation.</p>
<p>The proposed ordinance would affect county entities, not individual municipalities, Ms. Hallam said.</p>
<p>Technology that would fall under the purview of the ordinance would include automatic license plate readers, body cameras, gunshot detectors, facial recognition software, social media analytics software and video cameras that can remotely transmit or be remotely accessed, according to the proposed language.</p>
<p>The legislation would also require that the county implement a policy on use and file annual reports.</p>
<p>The district attorney’s office does not “use any sort of facial recognition software,”&nbsp;said Mike Manko, spokesman for the the office.</p>
<p>“The overwhelming majority of cameras involved in the network that District Attorney [Stephen] Zappala has worked to create in partnership with municipalities are owned by the municipalities,” Mr. Manko said. “Additionally, none of the cameras employ any facial recognition software. The state legislature has clearly defined through Act 22 the way that police agencies can collect and disseminate data from these cameras and as such, any ordinance on the county level seeking to do the same thing is unnecessary.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office does not own facial recognition&nbsp;“devices” but uses the technology made available through the State Police&nbsp;“very sparsely,” said Chief Deputy Kevin Kraus.</p>
<p>Chief Deputy Kraus said that the sheriffs do not own any of the other technology listed in the bill, including body cameras.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Police did not respond to questions about the technology.</p>
<p>The county administration does not comment on pending legislation.</p>
<p>Ms. Hallam said the county bill has been “in the works for months” and that she was&nbsp;“really excited” when the city introduced its legislation.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council passed a similar ordinance in a nearly unanimous vote on Sept. 22. Councilman Anthony Coghill was the lone no vote. Mayor Bill Peduto signed the legislation into law two days later.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police currently do not own facial recognition technology, but a database from the Pennsylvania Justice Network — otherwise known as JNET — is accessible to police forces across the commonwealth.</p>
<p>In June the city suspended the use of an algorithmic tool used to predict where crime “hot spots” would occur, citing concerns of potential racial bias.</p>
