<h1>Study shows walking is an increasingly dangerous activity</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Walking can be a hazardous activity, and itâ€™s getting more risky every year, according to a study released&nbsp;Wednesday by the Governors Highway Safety Association.</p>
<p>The study, based on projections from pedestrian deaths in the first six months of 2019, estimates more U.S. pedestrians died than in any year since 1988. That continues a scary trend that shows in the 10 years from 2009 through 2018, all traffic deaths increased by 2% but pedestrian deaths rose 53%.</p>
<p>Pedestrian deaths also continue to be a greater percentage of all traffic deaths with the 2019 estimate of 17% of all traffic deaths involving pedestrians the highest since 1982.</p>
<p>For 2019, the study estimates pedestrian deaths increased by 300 people (5%) while overall traffic fatalities are expected to rise 3.4%.</p>
<p>Study author Richard Retting, of Sam Schwartz Consulting, attributed the high number of pedestrian deaths to a number of factors: more people walking; more light trucks and other larger vehicles on the road, causing more serious injuries; and cellphone use distracting drivers and pedestrians.</p>
<p>A high majority of pedestrian deaths occur at night. During the 10-year period, nighttime pedestrian fatalities increased by 67% compared to a 16% increase in daytime pedestrian deaths.</p>
<p>The numbers were much better for Pennsylvania, which was among six states showing double-digit decreases in pedestrian deaths for the first six months of 2019. The state had 74 pedestrian deaths through June 2019, down from 89 the year before.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, pedestrian deaths were steady from 2009-18, usually from four to six a year except for two in 2011 and three in 2012.</p>
<p>The study recommends installing automatic emergency braking systems as one way to reduce deaths. Reducing drunken driving, less attention to cellphones, improved lighting on roads and at intersections were cited as ways to reduce pedestrian deaths.</p>
