<h1>Pennsylvania launches portal for manufacturers to match healthcare supplies to demand</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A group of government, nonprofit and trade organizations working to connect manufacturers of medical supplies with the healthcare customers who need them, have launched an online portal to streamline their matchmaking.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://spportal.dot.pa.gov/ppeinventory/pages/mschain.aspx" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Manufacturing Call to Action Portal</a> invites manufacturers and distributors to input their capabilities and their needs, including workforce gaps.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The portal is the public face of what the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania and a number of technology and manufacturing groups have been doing for several weeks.</p>
<p>Kevin Sunday, director of government affairs for the Pennsylvania Chamber, said he hopes it will expand the reach of this public-private initiative.</p>
<p>“The state intends on focusing first on suppliers with existing capacity,” he said.&nbsp;“The challenge with those manufacturers is much of the supply chain is outside of Pennsylvania — and a lot of times, overseas.</p>
<p>“With every country in an intense bidding war for supplies, plus the virus perhaps heating up again in the section of China where a lot of key components are made, we are hoping that those who can retool will be able to do so as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>He said state legislation that deals with liability concerns from manufacturers and providers is expected to move through the General Assembly soon. “This is absolutely needed right now,” Mr. Sunday said.</p>
<p>Rachel Moore, a spokeswoman for the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, said the state’s healthcare facilities still have the same needs as when her organization released an <a href="https://www.haponline.org/Portals/1/COVID-19/Supplies-List-COVID19.pdf?ver=2020-03-26-184633-157" target="_blank">extensive list of supplies</a> to guide donations and manufacturers looking to retool.&nbsp;</p>
