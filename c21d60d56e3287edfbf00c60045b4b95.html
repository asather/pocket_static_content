<h1>With paving finished early, two South Side streets to reopen Friday afternoon</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Crews expect to finish paving work and reopen South 15th and South 17th streets on Pittsburghâ€™s South Side by 5 p.m. Friday, several weeks ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>When the streets were closed Aug. 10, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said it expected the streets to be closed between East Carson and Bingham streets until early September.</p>
<p>The work is part of a $16.3 million project to improve pedestrian safety on East Carson, which has an active nightlife and is the most dangerous area for pedestrians and bicyclists in the region. Golden Triangle Construction is scheduled to finish work between&nbsp; the Smithfield Street Bridge and South 33rd Street with new traffic lights, crosswalks and bump-outs by the end of November.&nbsp;</p>
