<p>The Alex Galchenyuk era is over in Pittsburgh after 45 games and five goals.</p>
<p>The Penguins on Monday <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/10/pittsburgh-penguins-trade-minnesota-wild-alex-galchenyuk-jason-zucker/stories/202002100139" target="_blank">traded the winger</a>, along with top prospect Calen Addison and a first-round draft pick,&nbsp;to the Minnesota Wild for Jason Zucker.</p>
<p>In a bit of a twist, Galchenyuk never would have been with the Penguins in the first place if they’d had their way last offseason. They <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/06/11/Pittsburgh-Penguins-Phil-Kessel-trade-Evgeni-Malkin-Kris-Letang-Jim-Rutherford/stories/201906110095" target="_blank">had a deal in place to acquire Zucker,</a> but Phil Kessel nixed it. That forced general manager Jim Rutherford to find another, less favorable deal for Kessel.</p>
<p>The Penguins ended up sending Kessel to the Arizona Coyotes, getting Galchenyuk and prospect P.O. Joseph in return. Don’t forget, they also got financial flexibility in that deal, allowing them to add Brandon Tanev in free agency and giving them the room to lock in Marcus Pettersson to a long-term extension.</p>
<p>Still, that deal should be viewed at least as a mild disappointment given that they hoped Galchenyuk would at least be a 20-goal scorer here this season.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/12/05/pittsburgh-penguins-phil-kessel-trade-alex-galchenyuk-arizona-coyotes/stories/201912050167" target="_blank">took stock of the Kessel trade</a> back in December, when Kessel returned to Pittsburgh. Pretty much everything we wrote then about the trade, a mixed bag for both teams, still holds true today. But let’s talk about what went wrong here with Galchenyuk, whose playing time has dwindled over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>During training camp, he occasionally flashed skill or showed off his big shot skating on a line with Evgeni Malkin. It was clear it would take time for Malkin and Galchenyuk to establish some chemistry. It didn’t help that Galchenyuk had a nagging lower-body injury that eventually sidelined him for several games.</p>
<p>When he was in the lineup early on, he did a lot of the same things that Kessel did in his final season in Pittsburgh. He hovered high in the zone, waiting for the puck to find him. He steered clear of the battle areas. He was not the most committed defender. But he didn’t do one thing Kessel did here — score.</p>
<p>It took Galchenyuk <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/11/25/Alex-Galchenyuk-Jake-Guentzel-overtime-win-Flames-Tristan-Jarry-Jared-McCann/stories/201911250147" target="_blank">15 games to get his first goal</a>, despite skating with Malkin and getting ample power-play time. He got bumped down the lineup and <a href="https://theathletic.com/1436646/2019/12/05/alex-galchenyuk-not-a-lineup-lock-when-penguins-get-healthy/" target="_blank">kind of called out </a>by Rutherford. Goals in back-to-back games in late December gave hope that he might get going. But he had one goal in his final 16 games.</p>
<p>Even more troubling was his minus-6 rating during those 16 games. The fourth line has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/06/Pittsburgh-Penguins-fourth-line-Alex-Galchenyuk-Sam-Lafferty-Anthony-Angello/stories/202002060167" target="_blank">lacked an identity of late</a>, in part because Galchenyuk doesn’t have the right disposition to fill that kind of role. Coach Mike Sullivan couldn’t even trust them to play more than a few minutes in either game down in Florida.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time until Sullivan and the Penguins removed Galchenyuk from their lineup, either making him a healthy scratch or trading him away.</p>
<p>They found a taker for him Monday in the Wild. Zucker, a smart two-way winger with wheels, should much better fit with how the Penguins want to play.</p>
<p>“[Galchenyuk] worked hard,” Rutherford told the Post-Gazette’s Mike DeFabo after the trade Monday night. “It just didn’t seem to work out for him. Maybe our style of play was a little bit difficult for him to adjust to. But I give him credit. He’s a good guy. He works hard. Never complained. I hope this move works for him.”</p>
<p>The Wild will get the next two months to evaluate Galchenyuk, who is set to become a free agent this summer, and decide if they want to try to re-sign him. If he struggles in Minnesota, too, he might not have many suitors. The former No. 3 overall pick has now been with four organizations before turning 26.</p>
<p>Galchenyuk is by no means an elite NHL talent, and his passive style of play and his jerky skating stride prevented him from putting his dangerous shot to use in Pittsburgh, where Sullivan wants the Penguins to play balls to the wall.</p>
<p>But given the All-Stars he got a chance to play with and the decent skill level he possesses, Galchenyuk’s disappearing act was a bit of a bummer, even if the Penguins on Monday ended up getting the winger they coveted all along.</p>
