<h1>HHS secretary says federal investigators looking at Brighton COVID-19 outbreak</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Federal investigators spent three days earlier this month at a Beaver County nursing home looking into the state’s largest and deadliest COVID-19 outbreak there that has led to the deaths of 76 residents, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Friday during a visit at a local hospital.</p>
<p>“We are particularly concerned about the terrible, terrible losses at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center across the street,” he said during his remarks at a press conference at Heritage Valley Beaver hospital, located about a quarter mile from Brighton, “and we are completing our own federal investigation of the conditions and circumstances there and will publicly release our findings soon, and, if merited, we will certainly demand accountability.”</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, whose district includes Brighton and who on <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2020/05/07/Nursing-home-COVID-19-Brighton-Rehabilitation-Wellness-Center-Conor-Lamb-pittsburgh/stories/202005170005" target="_blank">May 7 requested a federal investigation</a>, said after Mr. Azar’s announcement that he was told that the federal investigation’s initial findings did not find any “immediate jeopardy” issues, but it did find problems with infection control protocols, similar to a state investigation that occurred a month earlier.</p>

<p>Brighton’s owners did not respond directly to questions about the investigation, but said, in part, in an emailed statement Friday: “We remain committed to working hand-in-hand with all local, state and federal authorities as we combat COVID-19 together. We are proud of the way our staff has faced these challenges head-on and continues to serve our residents with incredible compassion and the highest levels of care possible.”</p>
<p>Although the state has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/30/Brighton-Rehabilitation-Wellness-Center-coronavirus-cases-Beaver-PA-manager/stories/202004300182?cid=search" target="_blank">hired consultants</a>, a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/05/08/State-will-impose-a-temporary-manager-at-troubled-Beaver-County-nursing-home-again/stories/202005080110?cid=search" target="_blank">temporary manager</a>, and even <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/05/18/Pennsylvania-National-Guard-Brighton-Rehab-nursing-home-Beaver-County-will-leave/stories/202005180122?cid=search" target="_blank">called out the National Guard</a> to help Brighton, Mr. Azar laid at least part of the blame for the outbreak in the 589-bed nursing home on the hands of the state government — which provides most of the direct oversight of nursing homes — under Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat.</p>
<p>“In terms of past actions, Brighton, this is public information, has had several instances of jeopardy findings, as well as fines regarding the safe treatment of patients,” he said. “There is a serious question: Has the state been aggressive enough in taking action there?”</p>
<p>Later Friday, state Department of Health spokesman Nate Wardle responded in an emailed answer with a long recitation of the various steps the state has taken to help Brighton over the last three months, and he added: “On March 18 nursing homes received guidance to help them in the decision-making processes on cohorting, visitation and testing of employees and staff. This guidance follows what was provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is under the direction of HHS and Secretary Azar.”</p>
<p>“The department also has been working with the CMS, which has outlined guidance on inspections of health care facilities, including nursing homes,” Mr. Wardle wrote.</p>
<p>Mr. Azar said though he met with hospital staff, he decided not to visit Brighton itself because “they’re under investigation right now both by the state as well as by CMS and I felt it didn’t feel appropriate pending the investigation.” CMS is the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>“But I wanted to be here. I wanted to be here at Heritage Valley,” he said. “And I wanted to be frankly near Brighton just so that the people of Western Pennsylvania know how seriously the national government is taking this issue. We want the state to take it seriously also.”</p>
<p>Earlier Friday, Mr. Azar said he met with members of the Allegheny Conference, a coalition of business leaders in the region, who, he said, told him “about the challenges they face as employers and the importance of reopening both for the economy as well as the health of our community.”</p>
<p>Then he toured Heritage Valley’s orthopedic and endoscopy centers that have largely closed during the state’s lockdown, and joined a roundtable with local officials, including the Beaver County commissioners, “to learn about the need to move forward with a safe reopening in places like Pennsylvania,” he said.</p>
<p>He also came to talk about the federal inspection of Brighton, announcing the federal investigation — which had been known by most officials in the region for weeks — during his prepared remarks.</p>
<p>He noted having federal investigators inspect a nursing home was “unusual” since such inspections are almost exclusively done by state Department of Health inspectors.</p>
<p>“But in this instance we felt the situation was frankly so devastating in terms of the human impact and the pervasiveness, we actually sent federal inspectors in for that,” he said. “It’s unusual. Remember the primary jurisdiction is for states to do the investigations, inspections, survey and certification of nursing homes. They license them. They certify them. We pay them to do this work.”</p>
<p>Mr. Azar is not the first official to criticize the state Department of Health’s actions with Brighton.</p>
<p>All three Beaver County commissioners —&nbsp;two Republicans and one Democrat — have criticized the state’s response and asked for more assistance for Brighton.</p>
<p>“I personally liked the fact that he sent in federal inspectors and wants to get to the bottom of what’s happened across the state” at Brighton, said Commissioner Jack Manning, a Republican, who attended the tour and roundtable with Mr. Azar.</p>
<p>Commissioner Tony Amadio, a Democrat, said: “It’s gonna be interesting to see the outcome of the investigation.”</p>
<p>And both of Pennsylvania’s senators, Democrat Bob Casey and Republican Pat Toomey, have pressed the federal government to put pressure on Brighton and other nursing homes with outbreaks, although Mr. Toomey put blame on the state and Mr. Casey on the federal response.</p>
<p>“Senator Toomey previously urged the Administration to look at Brighton and other nursing homes with COVID-19 outbreaks to determine what went wrong,” Mr. Toomey’s office said in an emailed statement Friday. “It is clear that aggressive measures should have been taken in Pennsylvania to protect nursing home residents and prevent outbreaks in long term care facilities, particular in those the PA Department of Health knew were struggling to hit performance standards.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey noted <a href="https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Nursing%20Home%20COVID%2019%20Protection%20and%20Prevention%20Act%20OnePager1.pdf" target="_blank">a bill he has proposed to invest in nursing homes</a> and said in an emailed statement Friday: “The situation at Brighton is devastating. This Administration has failed the residents and workers of Brighton, just as they have failed the 37,000 Americans in long-term care settings who have lost their lives to COVID-19. That’s why I have called for a national action plan to save lives in nursing homes that includes an investment of $20 billion in PPE and testing and the long-overdue transparency we desperately need.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb announced earlier this month that he sent a letter on May 7 requesting a federal investigation into the outbreak at Brighton.</p>
<p>He sent it to Seema Verma, administrator of CMS, asking federal officials to “immediately investigate the competence and performance” of Brighton during the outbreak.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb said Ms. Verma called him shortly after she received his letter telling him there would be an investigation, which began just a few days later.</p>
<p>“I would commend them on how quickly they responded,”&nbsp; Mr. Lamb said.</p>
<p>Although the final report from federal investigators has not been completed, their initial findings as described by Mr. Lamb do not sound dissimilar to what state investigators found at Brighton a month earlier, on April 17.</p>
<p>That state inspection initially was found to have “immediate jeopardy” violations, but that level of violation was later withdrawn, Mr. Lamb has said. It was downgraded to “minimal harm” but exhibiting a “pattern.” Why it was downgraded is not known.</p>
<p>The state’s official report on that inspection, <a href="https://sais.health.pa.gov/commonpoc/content/publicweb/ltc-survey.asp?Facid=020802&amp;PAGE=1&amp;NAME=BRIGHTON+REHABILITATION+AND+WELLNESS+CENTER&amp;SurveyType=H&amp;COUNTY=BEAVER" target="_blank">which went up online earlier this week</a>, found a variety of hygiene and infection control issues, as basic as failure to wash hands, exhibit effective social distancing, failure to properly store linens, and to have soap available for hand washing.</p>
<p>All of that led to a finding that the violations “created the potential for the cross-contamination and the spread of diseases and infections for seven of 11 nursing units,” the state’s report concluded.</p>
<p>As for pinning blame for Brighton’s outbreak on a failure of the state to properly investigate the nursing home, Mr. Lamb said “there’s enough blame to go around.”</p>
<p>“The problems [at Brighton] over the years have been noted by CMS as well,” he said.</p>
<p>He said he asked on Thursday if he could be part of Mr. Azar’s tour and roundtable discussion, but was told he could not be.</p>
<p>“I’m happy they came to town. I want the administration to see what’s going right and what’s going wrong,” he said. “I just think they could make an effort in a non-partisan way.”</p>
<p>He said it was a shame that Mr. Azar did not visit Brighton.</p>
<p>“I think it would have meant something to the workers and families to see something, that it’s at the top of the list” for the administration, he said.</p>
