<h1>MLB announces support package for minor league players</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Major League Baseball on Thursday afternoon announced plans to pay its minor league players through April 8 — the day before what would have been the start of their season.</p>
<p>The majority of those players were not getting paid because of the COVID-19 pandemic putting baseball — and everything else — on hold.</p>
<p>Each player with a minor league contract will receive a lump sum equal to the allowances that would have been paid through April 8. The exceptions include players not on the 40-man roster who are already receiving major league allowances; players who are currently receiving housing, food or other services from clubs; and players who were not participating in, or expected to participate in, minor league spring training.</p>
<p>MLB said it will remain in communication with clubs about the second half of this equation: how to continue to pay minor leaguers after their season would’ve started on April 9.</p>
<p>The league has already delayed the start of its season until mid-May and likely longer when factoring in the necessary buildup for games to start again.</p>
<p>In the last several days, MLB and the MLBPA together announced a $1 million donation to be split evenly between Feeding America (FeedingAmerica.org) and Meals on Wheels America (MealsonWheelsAmerica.org).</p>
<p>All 30 MLB clubs have also pledged $30 million — $1 million per club — to support ballpark workers.</p>
<p>“MLB takes the community impact of this crisis seriously,” MLB said in a statement announcing the minor league deal. “We will continue to monitor ongoing events and undertake the precautions and best practices recommended by public health experts to protect fans, players and ballpark workers, and we urge all baseball fans to follow suit.</p>
<p>“MLB extends its best wishes to all the individuals and communities who have been impacted by the coronavirus.”</p>
