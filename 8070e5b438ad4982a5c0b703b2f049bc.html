<h1>Excela Health net income falls $37 million in March as COVID-19 disrupts care</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Community hospital system Excela Health on Wednesday reported a stunning $37 million net income loss for the month of March as non-emergency medical services were halted in Pennsylvania to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The operating margin loss for the three-hospital system for the month was 21%, which eased to a loss of 2.3% or $9.8 million for the nine months ending March 31.&nbsp;Gov. Tom Wolf ordered hospitals to suspend non-emergency operations and other medical procedures March 19, cutting deeply into revenue for virtually every health care provider.</p>
<p>On May 8, Excela began resuming elective admissions, surgeries and other procedures, but anticipates “significant operating losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020,” the system said in its financial report.</p>
<p>Excela offset the losses by drawing a $15 million line of credit in May and received “significant advances” in reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in April, which many hospitals received.</p>
<p>Also, the third-quarter results do not include $10.4 million that Excela received in April through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, which provided $100 billion to hospitals and other health care providers for expenses incurred by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The emergency funding will be recorded in the health system’s fourth quarter.</p>
