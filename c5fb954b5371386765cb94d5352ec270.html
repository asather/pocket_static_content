<h1>Joe Starkey: Might as well shut down baseball’s Hall of Farce</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Integrity, my Astro.</p>
<p>This will be the last time I write about Baseball’s Hall of Farce, about how sportswriters invoke the “integrity” clause — reportedly written into the ballot by a segregationist — in order to keep two of the greatest players of all time locked out of a museum that already includes, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/sports/baseball/baseball-hall-of-fame-has-always-made-room-for-infamy.html" target="_blank">the New York Times’ Bill Pennington put it</a>, “multiple virulent racists, drunks, cheats, brawlers, drug users and at least one acknowledged sex addict.”</p>
<p>If the idea is to keep the bad guys out, it’s a little late.</p>
<p>Cheating is as rampant as it ever was, as rampant as it always will be, whether it’s the 1951 New York Giants using an elaborate sign-stealing system, or the 2017 Houston Asterisks doing the same. Whether it’s players pumping amphetamines or anabolic steroids — or who knows what these days?— to gain an edge.</p>
<p>But you go, sportswriters. Cast aside Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens while Bumblin’ Bud Selig, who kept one eye closed and both ears covered as artificially jacked-up sluggers saved his sport, slides in (thanks to a vote that included current Hall of Famers, executives and media members)</p>
<p>This much is clear: Bonds and Clemens <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/21/Barry-Bonds-misses-Baseball-Hall-of-Fame-Derek-Jeter-Larry-Walker/stories/202001210146" target="_blank">missed the cut again Tuesday</a> and have no momentum toward gaining the necessary 75% of the vote.</p>
<p>Harold Baines is in. Barry Bonds is out.</p>
<p>ESPN’s David Schoenfield: “The totals from the publicly revealed ballots — which are almost all from active baseball writers — are much more favorable to Bonds and Clemens (both had more than 70% on the public ballots) than the private voters, who tend to be the retired writers or football writers who used to cover baseball and the like.”</p>
<p>The miracle in all this is that sportswriters were somehow designated as arbiters of morality. I happen to know many sportswriters — I am one — and I can tell you that not unlike a lot of professions, this one is riddled with hypocrites, weirdos, jerks, jock-sniffers, back-stabbers and narcissists. And that’s just the Penguins beat over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>You have some fine people, too, and from afar I’ve always considered ESPN’s Buster Olney one. Here’s Olney from 2012 on the wording of the so-called “character” or “integrity” clause, which states voters are to “base their vote not just upon a player’s record and ability but also his ‘integrity, sportsmanship (and) character.’ ”</p>
<p>“The truth is that the character clause has been an almost entirely obsolete entity in Hall of Fame voting except when writers wield it like zealous vice principals and pluck one or two decorum violators from a hallway of humanity and assign them detention in baseball purgatory. The wording is believed to have been written by longtime baseball commissioner Kennesaw Mountain Landis. The fact that Landis was a segregationist who endeavored to keep blacks out of baseball should have compelled writers to ignore the questions of character and integrity.”</p>
<p>It didn’t, although legendary baseball writer Peter Gammons is one who finally saw the light two years ago, writing, “The Hall of Fame is the museum of baseball history, hence I am at the point where the best player in the last 40 years (Bonds) and arguably the pitcher ever (Clemens) need to be parts of that museum, with whatever addendum is deemed necessary for their plaques.”</p>
<p>It’s not like the voters are bathing themselves in glory on other fronts. One decided it would be cool to reject Derek Jeter on Tuesday (at least the other 396 got that one right), and Larry Walker somehow went from receiving 15.5% of the vote in 2016 to getting elected. Did I miss Walker’s MVP season of 2018, at age 52? What did he do to change so many minds in four years?</p>
<p>Some voters checked something like 10 boxes on their ballot this year. Why not just go ahead and induct Aki Iwamura and his knee brace while you’re at it, guys?</p>
<p>By all means keep Bonds and Clemens on the porch. Because they apparently used steroids during an era in which Canseco estimated up to 85% of all players did the same.</p>
<p>Let’s take those two and punish them forever.</p>
<p>I’m sure Kennesaw Mountain Landis would be proud.</p>
