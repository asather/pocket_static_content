<h1>Can Luke Maile add offensive value for Pirates?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates did not add catcher Luke Maile this offseason for his offense. Sure, they figured he’d improve upon his .151 average from 2019. That unsightly .440 OPS would probably trend upward, too.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">But they signed the 29-year-old to a one-year, $900,000 contract back in December because of the way he plays defense and handles pitchers, something manager Derek Shelton observed back when Maile was with the Rays and both Shelton and general manager Ben Cherington were with the Blue Jays.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Thus far, Maile has been everything the Pirates anticipated getting from a defensive standpoint, but could he potentially contribute more with the bat? He thinks so.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I haven’t felt this good in a long time,” Maile said Sunday on a Zoom call with local reporters. “It’s obviously early, but I’m pretty encouraged with the way I’m swinging the bat right now.”</span></p>
<p>Listed at 6-foot-3, 225 pounds and swinging from the right side of the plate, Maile has a pretty good idea how a better swing feels, although he joked that he’d probably struggle to articulate it. “I’m not a huge mechanical guy,” Maile said.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">But, he added, some of the telltale signs are there. His legs are more involved. He’s shorter to the ball. In the past, Maile said after he signed, his size and a tendency to swing out of his shoes has gotten him into trouble.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I just feel like I have a swing that I remember doing when I was 5, 6, 7, 8 years old,” Maile said. “I think that’s probably the best way I can describe it.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The Pirates will likely take it, even if how they plan to divide up reps between Jacob Stallings, Maile and potentially John Ryan Murphy remains to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">It wasn’t long ago that Maile was a competent offensive option behind the plate, the former Kentucky Wildcat producing 2.1 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) per FanGraphs in 2018. That’s the same number for Atlanta’s Tyler Flowers in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“It’s the highest level of baseball there is,” Maile said about the potential catching rotation. “If you’re playing well, you’re going to be back there. If you’re not, then you don’t really have much of a leg to stand on, especially in a 60-game season. Nothing changes.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Defense has always come fairly easy to Maile, who finished 15th (2019) and 13th (2018) in Fielding Runs Above Average in each of the past two seasons, according to Baseball Prospectus.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">While the Pirates have seemingly been impressed with Maile’s swing — he did homer in an intrasquad the other day — he’s been equally as impressed with the pitchers he’s been catching.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Many have upped their velocity since spring training, Maile said. Those who didn’t have added a little crispness to what they’ve been throwing.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Pretty much across the board, everybody has impressed me with how ready they’ve looked,” Maile said.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">During quarantine time, Maile was actually able to see a few Pirates pitchers throw, as a couple times a week he made the drive from his Palm Harbor, Florida, home to Pirate City, also working out himself.</span></p>
<p>Nothing was terribly intense, Maile said, but the sessions gave him enough familiarity that he was able to quickly feel comfortable on the defensive side. Now, the next task will be staying compact in his swing and adding value from an offensive standpoint as well.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I just feel like myself,” Maile said. “I really don’t have a great explanation. I’m not a huge mechanical guy. I feel like my legs are more involved. I feel like when my legs are involved, I’m a little shorter to the ball. Very basic stuff.”</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Quiet time</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">What does Maile think about having no fans in the ballpark? He doesn’t believe it’ll feel real until the first game of the season, but he has noticed a huge difference thus far.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">A truck-sized difference.</span></p>
<p>“Every time I move inside to a hitter, it feels like a truck's rolling through the infield,” Maile said. “It's like you're not really invisible anymore as a catcher, so I'm trying to get set later [with] targets a lot more often than I otherwise would, because whether it's right or it's wrong, you feel kind of naked out there without having that white noise in the background.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“So it will be interesting, but we'll make adjustments.”</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">In a blowout</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The Pirates seemingly have no shortage of arms if a game gets out of hand.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Jose Osuna threw gas last season. Jacob Stallings was deceptive and got by more on guile. If the Pirates need a third position player to pitch, perhaps they could go with Maile, who said he’s good friends with former knuckleballer Charlie Haeger.</span></p>
<p>“He kind of showed me the grip one day about six or seven years ago, so I just started throwing them back into a screen in batting practice and stuff,” Maile said. “It started to develop a little bit. It’s not great by any means, but I at least have an idea of what I’m trying to do.”</p>
