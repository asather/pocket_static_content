<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Wednesday nominated Christy Wiegand, an assistant U.S. attorney based in Pittsburgh, to sit on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Ms. Wiegand, 44, of Pittsburgh, has served since 2004 in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, where she has prosecuted a variety of crimes, including large-scale drug trafficking, child exploitation, illegal firearms and fraud.</p>
<p>Ms. Wiegand recently prosecuted a case against a Pittsburgh man accused of distributing heroin and fentanyl that resulted in the deaths of drug users.</p>
<p>Previously, Ms. Wiegand served as a law clerk to Judge D. Brooks Smith of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. She received her undergraduate degree from Princeton University and her law degree from Cornell Law School.</p>
<p>Ms. Wiegand’s nomination comes amid a flurry of new faces on the 10-seat Western Pennsylvania bench this year, as the Republican-controlled Senate has moved to confirm Trump judicial nominees.</p>
<p>Most recently, Robert J. Colville, formerly a judge on the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, was confirmed by the Senate by a 66-27 vote in December. Stephanie Haines, a 49-year-old assistant U.S. attorney based in Johnstown, was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in September.</p>
<p>Ms. Wiegand joins William Scott Hardy, a Pittsburgh attorney who represents businesses on labor and employment matters, as pending nominees.</p>
<p>As usual, both Pennsylvania senators released a joint statement praising the new nominee.</p>
<p>“Christy Wiegand has a wealth of legal experience,” Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., stated. “I believe Ms. Wiegand’s experience, intellect, and commitment to the rule of law will serve her and the people of Pennsylvania well.”</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., added that it was clear from her experience as a federal prosecutor that she has the necessary intellect, experience and character to faithfully and independently administer justice for the people of the commonwealth.”</p>
<p>Ms. Wiegand, among four judicial nominees announced by the White House, will await a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>
