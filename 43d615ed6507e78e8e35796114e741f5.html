<h1>Analysis: How the Pirates will — and should — approach the trade deadline</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Even in a shortened season, Ben Cherington expects to be active around the trade deadline.</p>
<p>The Pirates general manager also said on a Zoom call Friday with local reporters that nobody was off-limits.</p>
<p>But don’t get too excited.</p>
<p>Because while Cherington believes conversations and the exchange of information will likely mirror a normal year, he also expects to have many of the same players in Pittsburgh whenever things finally do turn around.</p>
<p>“I really do believe there are a lot of players on this team who will be part of our team when we’re good, and we’re excited about that,” Cherington said.</p>
<p>Nailing the trade deadline, which comes at 4 p.m on Aug. 31, will be an important and difficult task for Cherington and the rest of the Pirates front office, one made more difficult because of no minor league season and also some serious slumps for the players Pittsburgh should probably look to move.</p>
<p>For example, had he enjoyed a hot start, perhaps a team might take a chance on Jarrod Dyson, a veteran outfielder who still defends well and has a World Series ring. Making $2 million over a full season, Dyson’s remaining salary would’ve been a pittance for a contender. His leadership might’ve helped.</p>
<p>The problem: He’s hitting .133 through 16 games, has zero extra-base hits, nine strikeouts and three walks. Oh, and he recently turned 36.</p>
<p>But honestly, Dyson isn’t even the biggest of the Pirates’ deadline issues. The Chris Archer situation hurts, too.</p>
<p>Had he not required season-ending surgery and was pitching more like the guy the Pirates thought they were getting two years ago, the case could be made that he simply needed that change of scenery, a socially acceptable distance from former pitching coach Ray Searage, with the new regime allowing him to pitch more like he knows how.</p>
<p>Instead, the Pirates can’t possibly move Archer, and they have an easy escape clause (a $250,000 buyout) in his contract after this season. It’ll help free up money, but he’ll walk for nothing.</p>
<p>One of the only reasonable assets the Pirates have at the major league level is Keone Kela, and even his value is a bit of a wild card.</p>
<p>While Kela’s stuff is terrific, he does not come without questions. Last year for him featured a fight with a coach, the perception of clubhouse issues and two throwing-arm problems. This year, where arm injuries have increased across the league because of the shortened ramp-up, Kela has pitched just twice after missing about a month because of his bout with COVID-19.</p>
<p>“We came into the year feeling like we had a pretty good handle on who we have and who we don't have,” Cherington said. “We know that there are obviously a lot of things we need to do better and get better at as a team.</p>
<p>“If there are ways to move toward that between now and the deadline, we'll definitely pursue that.”</p>
<p>And opposing teams can ask about anyone, Cherington added.</p>
<p>“There's no one player that you know we can't talk about,” Cherington said. “There's no one player that we need to move either. So we'll just continue to engage in the conversations and see if there are ways we can help ourselves going forward over the next several days.”</p>
<p>An additional complicating factor here is sample size. That would seem to affect Adam Frazier, who was an attractive piece at the MLB winter meetings but began Friday’s game hitting just .171, dropping to eighth in the order as a result.</p>
<p>The Pirates are doing everything they can to ignite Frazier, but other teams aren’t stupid; they see that. It’s also quite normal for even the best hitters to endure a 20-game stretch where they hit .171 in the middle of a season.</p>
<p>What’s much more difficult is when it occurs at the beginning of a shortened season, where everybody pays extra attention, and also the rest of the league — in the form of trade interest — must react given it’s already close to the deadline.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure that 21 games is indicative of a particular player's performance or a team's performance,” Cherington said. “But it is what we have. And so in terms of how that informs us going into the deadline, I don't think it really does.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Cherington seems to expect that to pop up before or around the trade deadline — teams having different valuations on a player because of how he’s performed in a couple dozen games.</p>
<p>The employing team might see more and ask for more. The inquiring team would be on the other end of that scale. The trick will be whether those conversations ever produce anything substantive.</p>
<p>“We can't control how other teams are going to react to that, so we'll just have to listen and learn,” Cherington said. “There are plenty of guys here who we really like, value and believe are good players, and maybe they aren't performing up to their past levels.</p>
<p>“Doesn't mean they won't later on this year. Doesn't mean they won't next year. We’ve got a lot of time on a lot of these guys."</p>
<p>The part about having current players on the roster whenever the Pirates do turn the corner was interesting — and not just because Cherington actually admitted that the Pirates aren’t good right now. (Normally he has steered clear in making any sort of plain-as-day statements such as this one.)</p>
<p>Who’s he talking about here? And is that the right move? Cherington could be referencing Bryan Reynolds and Kevin Newman. In which case, great. It makes sense to sign those guys to extensions.</p>
<p>But what about the guys who are going through arbitration for the second time this offseason? That group includes Josh Bell, Trevor Williams, Frazier, Chad Kuhl, Joe Musgrove and Erik Gonzalez.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine all six staying, and it’s hard to imagine all six going. This season, the only tradable assets in that group would probably be Bell (whose stock is low), Williams (who might make sense) and Gonzalez (whose hot start still won’t produce much in the way of return, meaning it’s probably better to keep him under club control).</p>
<p>Bell is also a special case. He’s clearly someone the fan base cares about and might be upset if Cherington moved, calling it another Andrew McCutchen or Gerrit Cole situation.</p>
<p>“I think generally speaking, and I don’t want to speak for specific fans because I don’t want to pretend I’m in someone else’s shoes, but I’ve been a fan for a lot longer than I’ve done this job,” Cherington said. “I guess how I feel about it is the attachment is to the team and winning, and then of course we grow attached to the players, too, along that way.</p>
<p>“But we wake up every day thinking about the team first, and so we just have to keep that in front of us. What can we do in our jobs to help the Pittsburgh Pirates get better, move toward being a winning team and then be able to sustain that? There are lots of things that go into that. Trading players is one of those, and just about every successful team that I know of in baseball, including teams who are in somewhat similar situations to the Pirates, are doing that. They’re sometimes making those kinds of moves.”</p>
<p>Again, as Cherington said, it’s complex. There are many moving parts. And the Pirates absolutely should try to do as much as they can within the next 7-10 days to take advantage of this time. But they also must avoid coming off as desperate.</p>
<p>“I think we need to work as hard as we can to see if there are opportunities between now and the deadline to get better and help ourselves, put ourselves in a stronger position going forward,” Cherington said. “But we can’t force it. If you start thinking that you have to do something, it almost always leads to mistakes.</p>
<p>“We need to work as hard as we can to see if we can find opportunities to help us get stronger and put us in a better position, but I don’t feel like there’s anything we have to do.”</p>
