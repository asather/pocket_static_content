<h1>'Mini-news outlets' for businesses: chambers of commerce press for paycheck protections amid COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Across Pittsburgh’s 18 North Side neighborhoods, the business community ranges from industrial manufacturers and warehouses to professional sports teams and entertainment venues to shopping centers and small mom-and-pop retail shops and restaurants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From an office on Middle Street in East Allegheny, Gina Grone has been handling a flood of calls from businesses as the COVID-19 pandemic has shuttered operations and postponed live events. Ms. Grone, executive director and lone staff member of the North Side/Shore Chamber of Commerce, counts about 200 businesses as members, with 80% of those employing fewer than 20 people, she said.</p>
<p>Now, her job has been consumed with setting up webinars, sifting through the fine print of government loan programs and trying to give all the facts so businesses can make critical decisions.</p>
<p>“People are looking to their local chamber as a sort of trusted source for what is true right now,” Ms. Grone said.</p>
<p>Yet chambers of commerce are in the awkward position of working long hours to help small businesses understand federal emergency loans that they, the chambers, are excluded from.</p>
<p>Congress — which included loans for a range of businesses of all sizes in its $2.3 trillion economic rescue bill last month — left out trade associations from the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program. That program offered $349 billion of fully forgivable loans for small business’ payroll costs and other operational expenses through June 30.</p>
<p>The loans were extended to some nonprofits, including 501(c)(3) groups like churches and 501(c)(19) veterans organizations. But lawmakers left out other nonprofits like chambers, trade associations, labor unions and social clubs. Chambers are formed under the 501(c)(6) legal structure, which, unlike 501(c)(3) nonprofits, are permitted to&nbsp;lobby and advocate for political issues.</p>
<p>Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters, said he was disappointed chambers were left out and promised to push for it in the next major piece of legislation, which lawmakers are calling “phase 4.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They should’ve been included, especially in a time like this,” Mr. Reschenthaler said during an SBA webinar this month. “Trade associations can do a lot of good.&nbsp;So if we do go to a phase 4, I want to revisit that and try to see if we can expand that to those organizations.”</p>
<p>But chambers may be waiting at the end of a very long line.</p>
<p>Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, suggested any fix likely would come after lawmakers ensure the existing Paycheck Protection Program is working properly.&nbsp;Last week, Congress replenished the paycheck program with another $310 billion in loan money without changing the eligibility rules.</p>
<p>“My immediate concern is we have so many people in the pipeline right now that aren’t getting money yet, and we’ve blown through the $349 billion,” Mr. Doyle said earlier this month on a webcast hosted by the Pittsburgh Technology Council.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Association of Chamber Professionals counts 78 organizations that cover most major cities, towns or counties in the state. Some regions have multiple groups. Chambers covering the North Side and the Pittsburgh International Airport are two examples.</p>
<p>“Those regional and smaller chambers are really important cogs in the economic engine in a lot of parts of Pennsylvania,” said Matt Smith, president of the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce. “We want to make sure that 501(c)(6) change is made, hopefully in the next phase.”</p>
<p>The network of small and regional chambers can be crucial conduits of information during the economic shutdown.</p>
<p>“Our job has become very much like a mini-news outlet for our business community,” said Kellie Goodman Shaffer, president and CEO of the Bedford County Chamber of Commerce and chair of the statewide chamber association.&nbsp;“Small businesses are busy trying to keep their business going.&nbsp;They don’t have the time and resources to be monitoring all this information.”</p>
<p>For those chambers, it can be tough to make the payroll and keep the lights on with waived membership fees, cancelled fundraisers and refunded sponsorship money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Shaffer has allowed the Bedford County group’s 640 businesses, which employ more than 20,000 people, to defer dues payments during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’re a business also,” Ms. Shaffer said, who added she is taking the group’s finances “week to week.”</p>
<p>The African-American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania, with 566 member businesses has been forced to cancel nine events between March and June.&nbsp;Doris Carson Williams, the group’s president and CEO, said&nbsp;“we’ve been doing everything we can, and our members are holding on.”</p>
<p>Her days may get busier: When Congress refilled the loan program last week, it required&nbsp;participation by lending institutions serving&nbsp;minority-owned businesses.</p>
<p>“We’re making payroll, but we hope to be in the next round of money becoming available,” Ms. Williams said.</p>
<p>Melody Longstreth, executive director of the&nbsp;Greene County Chamber of Commerce, said the group’s “bank account keeps dwindling, but requests for help go up.”</p>
<p>“Not being able to access funding that we’re helping businesses get is ironic,” Ms. Longstreth said.</p>
<p>“It’s very frustrating that the powers in DC seem to think all chambers are lobbying organizations. We’re the grassroots. We’re not lobbying for changes in Harrisburg and DC. We’re here to serve businesses.”</p>
