<h1>Millennial Mayors call on students to join them in Pittsburgh Marathon </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Local politicians are going to be running again and it’s not for re-election.</p>
<p>They’re running in the Dick’s Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon as part of the three-day event’s relay teams on May 3. The FedEx Pittsburgh Marathon Relay breaks the 26.2-mile course into more manageable bites.</p>
<p>Calling themselves the Millennial Mayors, the team includes Braddock Mayor Chardae Jones, Bellevue Mayor Emily Marburger, Sharpsburg Mayor Matt Rudzki, and Etna Council members Jessica Semler and Megan Tunon. In addition, the town leaders are encouraging youths in their districts to participate in the Kids of Steel program and race powered through RUNwithP3R.</p>
<p>Each mayor is calling out the students in their school districts to join the teams. “Here’s looking at you, Fox Chapel Area School District students,” said Mr. Rudzki in his Facebook post on Feb. 19. “We have to do it this year,” he said.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old mayor is coming out of running retirement. He ran 5,000-meter, 10,000-meter and cross-country races while on the Washington &amp; Jefferson College track team and was inducted into the athletic hall of fame there but was later sidelined with turf toe. Since then, the attorney, mayor and new father has been rather busy and needs to start working out.</p>
<p>“I now do lots of biking, kayaking and walking,” he said.</p>
<p>“How many Northgate School District students will join me by running the Kids of Steel race” asked Ms. Marburger in her Facebook post. “I’ll bet we could have a lot of fun training together!”</p>
<p>Northgate, she said, already participates in the marathon’s Kids of Steel race, so she is training with the kids after school. “These kids have a lot of energy!”</p>
<p>The students will have to work hard to keep up with the 32-year-old mayor who has completed 10 half-marathons. “I haven’t run in a little while though, because mayoring has sort of taken over my life.”</p>
<p>Ms. Marburger was elected to lead the small town along the Ohio River two years ago, and it’s her first experience in public office. “I haven’t burned the place down yet,” she joked.</p>
<p>Ms. Marburger said her daily 3-mile runs and Saturday 5-milers have been a great way to disconnect and relax. “It’s been a great complement to being mayor.”</p>
<p>In her own post, Braddock’s Ms. Jones said, “Me and my fellow millennial elected officials are running a relay. I haven’t run since college, but, hey, it’s for a good cause and in good company.”</p>
<p>“My strategy is to build up endurance,” said Ms. Jones, who just turned 31. “I go to the gym every now and then and run on the treadmill.”</p>
<p>She said she hasn’t run on pavement since she was a student at Carlow University and would traverse the streets of Oakland. “Everybody has a portion [of the relay] that’s a different number of miles. Mine’s the shortest. I’m just excited to participate.”</p>
<p>Representing Etna are Ms. Semler, the newest council member, and Mrs. Tunon, one of the youngest.</p>
<p>“Mayor Matt roped us into it,” Ms. Semler said. “I hate running. I don’t run. But if you get asked to join the Millennial Mayors relay team you just say OK.”</p>
<p>She’s using the app From the Couch to a 10K as a training tool. “I should be ready.”</p>
<p>At 32, the council member stays active, lifting weights, doing yoga and riding an elliptical. She just avoids hard pavement. She said she’s jealous of Ms. Jones, who has the shortest leg of the run. Ms. Semler’s is just over 5 miles as is that of her fellow council member.</p>
<p>Ms. Tunon, who has 2- and 4-year-old boys, did the relay in 2017. “It was really fun,” she said. “There’s lots of excited people cheering you on. I’m happy to be included as an honorary mayor.”</p>
<p>While training, she plans to put her youngest in the jogging stroller while the oldest is in preschool. She’ll hit the Allegheny River Trail and the loop around North Park Lake. The stroller, she said, adds 50 pounds of resistance. “When you’re finished, you feel light as a feather.”</p>
<p>A three-year veteran of council, Ms. Tunon said she’s looking forward to the relay and the location Mr. Rudzki chose — the one closest to Etna, with which she is familiar. She’s ready to attack her leg of the relay, which is about 6½ miles but easier than the uphill portion chosen by the Sharpsburg mayor. “Matt’s definitely the strongest runner,” she said. “He’s going to do the uphill portion. He’s really taking one for the team.”</p>
<p>The two major stand-ins plan to reach out to Shaler Area School District through social media and perhaps use the Etna Ecodistrict platform to attract young teammates.</p>
<p>According to the Pittsburgh Marathon website, overall course pace is 16 minutes per mile. Those who lag behind can board a sweep vehicle to the finish line.</p>
