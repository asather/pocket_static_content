<h1>'This is my fault': Beltzhoover man arrested in shooting death of 3-year-old girl</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Beltzhoover man who was sleeping next to a three-year-old girl with a loaded shotgun under his pillow said he woke up to a loud bang early Sunday and found her dead from a neck wound, Pittsburgh police said.</p>
<p>"What do you want from me, man?" Marlin Pritchard, 52, later told detectives, according to a complaint. "This is my fault."</p>
<p>Pritchard, a felon, was charged Sunday with homicide, endangering the welfare of children and weapons offenses.</p>
<p>Pritchard said he was sleeping next to the girl and another child with his pistol-grip shotgun under his pillow and pointed in the direction of the children.</p>
<p>"Pritchard stated that he 'heard the bang' and saw that [one child] jumped up off the bed and run," an affidavit said.</p>
<p>But the three-year-old didn't move. Pritchard said he then saw blood and picked the girl up, saying "wake up" to her as he held her. She'd been shot in the right side of the neck. Authorities pronounced her dead at 1:34 a.m.</p>
<p>Officers initially responded to a call for "unknown trouble" at 1:20 a.m. at 258 East Warrington Avenue.</p>
<p>Two adult witnesses were standing outside in the rear when officers arrived and said someone may have been shot inside.</p>
<p>Police entered the rear door, found Pritchard in a bedroom and took him into custody. They then found the little girl lying unresponsive in the bed.</p>
<p>Police drove Pritchard to police headquarters where they said he confessed.</p>
<p>According to the affidavit, he said he had left for a contracting job at about 2:30 p.m. and drank a 24-ounce beer on the way. He came back around 8 or 9 but didn't drink any more, he said. He had also been taking Vicodin for dental pain, although he said he hadn't had one since Thursday.</p>
<p>When he arrived home, there were five people in the house: The two adult witnesses and three children. Pritchard's relationship to them was not specified.</p>
<p>He lay down in his bed while the three-year-old and the other child watched movies. Pritchard said he kept the gun under his pillow because people were out to get him. He said a couple for whom he had done contracting work had come to his house on Saturday morning to complain about his work and threaten him, which is why he had the gun under his pillow. He said he'd also been involved in an ongoing dispute for a year with someone named "Vic."</p>
<p>He said he was sleeping on the left side of the bed with the two children on the right side, with the television on, when the gun went off.</p>
<p>After the shooting, one of the witnesses said Pritchard took the gun outside and put it next to some tires. He then went back into the bedroom and held the little girl, police said.</p>
<p>When officers arrived, they said, he told them where he'd put the gun.</p>
