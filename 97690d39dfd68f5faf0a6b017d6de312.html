<h1>Pittsburgh school district blocks site after 'inappropriate' video</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools has blocked student access to a website that billed itself as offering safe content for children after a teacher posted a link to a video that turned out to contain “inappropriate” content.</p>
<p>“This morning, we took immediate action upon notification of an inappropriate video that was embedded in the link of an educational video on Safe YouTube,”&nbsp;Superintendent Anthony Hamlet said in a statement, referring to the site SafeYouTube.net, which&nbsp;bills itself as a free website aiming to prevent exactly this sort of incident, enabling viewers&nbsp;“to watch and share YouTube videos in a pure atmosphere ... without being drawn to any unrelated or offensive videos or comments.”</p>
<p>That didn’t happen in this case, Mr. Hamlet said.</p>
<p>“A teacher posted the link in an early childhood classroom dashboard on Schoology,” he said. “The link, which was supposed to contain a counting nursery rhyme, included inappropriate content. This is unacceptable.”</p>
<p>The district has blocked access indefinitely to SafeYouTube.net from district-issued devices.</p>
<p>“Even as educators, we are still learning ourselves and vow to continually make sure cyber security is a priority,” he said, encouraging parents and staff to be vigilant. “If you see something, say something. We are here to make E-Learning accessible and digitally responsible for all families.”</p>
<p>The statement did not indicate how the link was connected to the offensive video, but Mr. Hamlet cited reports of other cyberattacks hitting schools across the nation.</p>
<p>The incident involved an early childhood lesson at Pittsburgh Minadeo, and the district learned about it from a Facebook post by a parent who discovered the problem, district spokeswoman Merecedes Williams said.&nbsp;The link had originally connected to the nursery-rhyme video, and the teacher was unaware the link had been taken over to direct users to the inappropriate video.</p>
