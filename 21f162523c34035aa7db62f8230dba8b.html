<h1>Port Authority replaces chief of operations after 15 months</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Maurice Bell was hired as Port Authority’s chief of operations in January 2019, he was the last member of new CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman’s administrative team. Now, just over a year later, he’s the first one out.</p>
<p>The authority said Friday that Mr. Bell left the agency March 31, but it wouldn’t say whether he left voluntarily. His job has been divided into two positions — chief operating officer for operations and chief operating officer for maintenance —&nbsp;now held by Port Authority veterans.</p>
<p>“[Mr. Bell] no longer works at Port Authority,” authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said. “Anything else would be a personnel issue.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bell, who Ms. Kelleman was familiar with when they both worked in Dallas more than 10 years ago, came to the authority after two years in the private sector working for a firm developing technology for self-driving vehicles. One of his main goals here was to improve the agency’s on-time performance. which at about 67% lagged substantially behind peer agencies across the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Bell, 52, had a salary of $182,700.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelleman set a goal when she was hired in January 2018 to improve on-time performance to 73% within her first year. Two years later, that number remains below 70%, although it’s unclear whether that had anything to do with Mr. Bell’s departure.</p>
<p>The day after Mr. Bell left, Ms. Kelleman appointed Donald A. Rivitti Jr. as acting chief operating officer for maintenance at a salary of $133,356. Mr. Rivitti, 47, has been with the authority since Aug. 1, 2002, and had been the deputy overseeing maintenance.</p>
<p>At the same time, Michael T. Heidkamp, 57, was promoted from deputy overseeing transportation to acting chief operating officer for transportation. Mr. Heidkamp, who has been with the agency since Nov. 29, 1993, has a salary of $143,352.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether splitting operations into two jobs is a permanent move.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the answer to that and I don’t know if that’s been decided,”&nbsp;Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>At a virtual board meeting Friday, Ms. Kelleman said the agency is doing a good job providing reduced service during the pandemic despite having two new department heads.</p>
