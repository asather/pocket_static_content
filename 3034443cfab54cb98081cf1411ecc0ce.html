<h1>East End pain pill distributor gets 14 years in federal prison</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Wilkinsburg woman who acted as the broker for a ring of drug addicts and dealers who obtained prescription narcotics from bad doctors and resold them on the streets went to federal prison last week for 14 years.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak sent Antoinette Adair away on Thursday.</p>
<p>Adair, a 49-year-old mother of four, dealt in large quantities of pain pills that she initially received from Oliver Herndon, a prolific pill mill doctor, and later from another physician when Herndon went to prison.</p>
<p>She used some pills to feed her own addiction and resold thousands of others, acting as a leader in recruiting addicts to obtain pills for a lucrative street business funded by the government, since the pills were paid for by Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Brendan Conway said Adair bragged to another convicted ringleader, William Richardson, about her ability to "hustle" in getting pills and making money.</p>
<p>In one recorded call, she boasted that she had 12 people visiting Herndon to receive prescriptions to be turned over to her.</p>
<p>"So you know what kind of money I was making," she said.</p>
<p>Richardson, of Geyer Avenue in Woods Run, told her he'd been making up to $10,000 a month selling pills, some supplied by Adair and others from a Detroit source.</p>
<p>Adair's pill-collecting crew included her mother, Brenda Adair, and her sister, Alandia Adair, according to a statement she gave to the FBI.</p>
<p>Mr. Conway said Adair distributed huge quantities of oxycodone pills from 2007 to 2016.</p>
<p>He said she had also boasted to Richardson that she had threatened someone with a gun in protecting her business, saying "I ain't to be played with."</p>
<p>Adair's lawyer, Stephen Misko, said his client had a rough upbringing in the Hill District and suffered from sexual abuse at the hands of her mother's boyfriend as a teen. In 2011, while working at UPMC Mercy, she cracked her tailbone and tore her rotator cuff while trying to lift an obese man, Mr. Misko said. She received oxycodone from Herndon and became addicted.</p>
<p>He requested a light sentence of time served and probation, saying she can be "reintegrated into society through a rehabilitative and responsible road map" crafted by the judge.</p>
<p>But Judge Hornak decided on a heavy prison term, giving her 120 months for defrauding Medicare and 168 months for conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute oxycodone. The terms will be served at the same time.</p>
