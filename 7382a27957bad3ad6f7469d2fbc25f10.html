<h1>Joe Starkey’s mailbag: What does ‘too many Steelers in the Hall of Fame’ mean, anyway?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Princell Brockenbrough and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Ed Barr, @BigEdBarr71:</strong> Hey Joe! 1st time question. I keep hearing that, "Oh, there is too many ‘Steelers’ in the Hall of Fame.” To my knowledge, players are inducted as players, not as members of a team. Is this still the way it works?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Excellent question, Dr. Barr, and the idea that “too many Steelers are in the Hall of Fame” is patently ridiculous, as is the idea that you can’t induct a certain number of players from the same team in the same year.</p>
<p>Put the best players in.</p>
<p>Of course, I say this a day after <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/02/03/chiefs-win-super-bowl-liv-wasp-play-fmia-peter-king/?cid=nbcsports#the-lead-kc-wins-liv" target="_blank">Peter King revealed he did not vote for Troy Polamalu</a> for the Hall of Fame because, you know, he figured Troy would get in regardless of his vote and decided to use it elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was King’s reasoning:</p>
<p>“I think an explanation for the lack of vote for Polamalu on the final five is necessary. I believe he was one of the top five candidates this year, and I believe in voting for the best five candidates. But because I felt certain Polamalu would make it regardless of my vote, I decided to vote for three players I felt were marginal after listening to the deliberations—Atwater, Boselli and Lynch. I don’t feel great about doing that, honestly. Our jobs are to vote for the best five, and I was totally on the fence about the fifth yea vote had I marked down Polamalu. It still bothers me a little bit. But I felt so strongly about the cases of Atwater, Boselli and Lynch, who were exceedingly close in my eyes, that I wanted to vote for them, knowing that a vote not for Polamalu was not going to keep him out. I’ve done this a couple of times before, and I absolutely do not want to make it a habit. It just felt like the right thing to do this year.”</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Here’s one thing I think: Sportswriters should no longer be trusted as guardians of the Halls of Fame in football in baseball. Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds are not in the Baseball Hall of Fame, but Harold Baines and Ted Simmons are?</p>
<p>As for King, If you’re not going to vote your conscience every single time, why are you doing this?</p>
<p>Having said all that, I didn’t have a huge problem with Steve Hutchinson going in over Alan Faneca. Their resumes are virtually identical (Faneca was chosen first-team All Pro — chosen by sportswriters — one more time than Hutchinson; both were first-team members of the all-2000s team).</p>
<p>I felt badly for the richly deserving Faneca, however, and the good news is this: If you put Hutchinson in, you have to put Faneca in. It might take two more years — Peyton Manning, Charles Woodson and Calvin Johnson are up next year — but Faneca will absolutely get in.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Sliman, @RickSliman:</strong> Why aren’t Steelers talking to Greg Olsen?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> If they’re not, Mr. Sliman — and that’s a fairly safe assumption — it’s probably because he’s old and banged up. He is coming off somewhat of a bounce-back season with 52 catches for 597 yards and two touchdowns, but, like many of us, he is mostly a shell of his former self.</p>
<p>The real question is this: Should they bring back Vance McDonald?</p>
<p>Our very own <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/02/Pittsburgh-Steelers-Kevin-Colbert-Cam-Heyward-Vance-McDonald-Ramon-Foster-Anthony-Chickillo-Mark-Barron/stories/202001020107" target="_blank">Ray Fittipaldo’s take</a>:</p>
<p>“McDonald’s production dipped big-time last season. He went from 610 receiving yards to 273 and saw his yards-per-catch average plunge from 12.2 to 7.2. That should be alarming to the coaches. McDonald had trouble getting open against man coverage. The Steelers shouldn’t face as much man coverage when Ben Roethlisberger returns, but Colbert has to decide if his $7.2 million cap hit is too high for a player who not only is on the decline but has a history of injuries. The Steelers can save $5.6 million by releasing McDonald. Then there is this: He’ll turn 30 in June.”</p>
<p>My take: That all makes sense, but if McDonald was injured last season, and if the Steelers believe he will be sufficiently recovered from said injury, I take a chance and bring him back. It’s hard to believe his production would fall off so radically if he were healthy. He had an excellent rapport with Ben Roethlisberger, and the Steelers have so many other needs (they should still snag a tight end in the draft, even if McDonald returns) that I’d be willing to take the chance.</p>
<p>Your take: This, via my flash Twitter Poll (15 minutes) on Tuesday morning: Should the Steelers keep McDonald?</p>
<p>Nearly 400 responders said:</p>
<p>Yes: 27.9%</p>
<p>No: 55.3%</p>
<p>Maybe Mullsy did hit 9 3s: 16.8%</p>
<p>What we learned: The Mullsy thing just won’t die.</p>
<p><strong>BJO, @Bduq22:</strong> If Ben can’t go in 2020, is it Rudolph backed up by someone off the street? Or do they go after someone who can play a little?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Money is an object here, Mr. BJO. However, with the quarterback market likely flooded this offseason, it might be the perfect time to find a competent veteran who is both desperate and cheap and sign him to a one-year deal.</p>
<p>Do I think the Steelers will do that?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Would I do that?</p>
<p>Absolutely. I love the way Rudolph bounced back against the Jets, but I believe there are veterans out there who could give the Steelers a better chance to win if Roethlisberger isn’t ready.</p>
<p>By the way, I guess it’s encouraging to hear Ben might <a href="/%20https:/www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/03/ben-roethlisberger-elbow-injury-update-steelers-offseason/stories/202002040025%20" target="_blank">soon be cleared to throw light objects</a> and tennis balls in the near future, but I won’t be convinced of his good health until he can throw furniture off a balcony.</p>
<p><strong>jim davies, @dhrinak80:</strong> What could the halftime show of next year's Super Bowl be, so that it is even worse than this years?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Mullsy shooting 3’s? AB throwing rocks? Cook &amp; Joe taking calls?</p>
<p><strong>Derek P., @77thMan:</strong> What do you think of a hybrid DH system? Tie the DH to the starting pitcher... when a team pulls the starter the DH gets replaced by the reliever in the lineup ... make coaches coach again.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Brian DeVinney, @BJDeVinney:</strong> Why is catcher a priority? Most teams get by with a below avg hitters in that spot. I think only four catchers even qualified for batting title. So platoon okay guys who catch good game, right?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I’m partial to catchers who can hit and catch, Dr. DeVinney, but that’s just me. At the very least, I like catchers who hit better than .151 (hello, Luke Maile).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jacob Stallings is outstanding defensively and is a respectable .268 in 257 career at-bats. I just don’t believe he’s a legit No. 1 guy.</p>
<p>On the other, other hand, the Pirates can afford to wait to find their catcher of the future. It is clearly a rebuild year, so they might as well sink to the bottom and get themselves the best possible draft pick.</p>
