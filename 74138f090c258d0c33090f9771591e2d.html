<p>Penn State’s 2020 schedule is out. Again.</p>
<p>Days after the Big Ten announced its plans for football to return in October, the conference released its new slate of games Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The Nittany Lions will open their season Oct. 24 at Indiana. A big matchup looms in Week 2 when Ohio State visits Beaver Stadium on Halloween.</p>
<p>A road trip to Michigan on Nov. 28 and a season finale at home vs. Michigan State on Dec. 12 highlight the rest of the schedule.&nbsp;A ninth game (and the league’s championship game) will be played Dec. 19 based on conference standings. If that format existed last season, the Nittany Lions, who finished second in the East Division, would’ve played Minnesota, which finished second in the west. College Football Playoff selections are set for Dec. 20.</p>
<p>The schedule release comes as the state has expressed concern about rising COVID-19 cases in Centre and Cambria counties.&nbsp;Total COVID-19 cases at Penn State have nearly doubled in seven days to 1,372, up from 709 a week ago, according to data released Friday. Nearly all of the cases are on or near the main University Park campus,&nbsp;Penn State President Eric Barron said.&nbsp;This past Wednesday, Penn State’s athletic department reported 50 positive tests among 859 athletes tested in the most recent athlete testing period from Sept. 5-11.</p>
<p>The Big Ten has said it will begin daily antigen testing of its athletes, coaches and staff on Sept. 30.&nbsp;Team positivity rates and population positivity rate thresholds will be used to determine whether teams must halt practice or play. The earliest an athlete will be able to return to game competition would be 21 days following a COVID-19 positive diagnosis.</p>
