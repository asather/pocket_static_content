<h1>Fishing Report: Anglers hook big stocked trout, Northerns and muskie</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County) The state Fish and Boat Commission this week retained the yellow perch harvest limit of 30 per day for 2020. Six walleye of at least 15 inches are legal.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Wilhelm</strong> (Mercer County) A muskellunge in the legal 40-inch range was caught and released.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Forest County) Muskies and Northern pike were taken from shore and boat in the Tionesta Sand and Gravel pool.</p>
<p><strong>East Hickory Creek</strong> (Forest County) Keaton McCaslin, 7, of Ross landed a beautiful brook trout last Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Clarion County) Smallmouths and walleye were caught near Emlenton and Parker.</p>
<p><strong>Clarion River</strong> (Clarion County) Muskies, Northerns and walleye were taken near the confluence with the Allegheny River.</p>
<p><strong>French Creek</strong> (Crawford, Venango counties) Snowmelt flow was off-color, about 40 degrees and the fishing was slow when James Swearingen of Windgap and a friend fished on Saturday morning. “We left and then came back at around 1 p.m. after the sun came up and had a chance to warm the water a bit. Within an hour we had two big pike on the bank. Goes to show what a couple degrees in water temps can do.” Northerns spawn when the water hits 40 degrees. The fish were released.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Arthur</strong> (Butler County) “Crappie Crushin’ TV” YouTube channel host Joe Fazio of Mount Washington said when the water dropped from 57 to 53 degrees, mature crappies retreated to deeper depths. He and a friend switched tactics and had hookups drifting floating jigs in yellow chartreuse and fluorescent pinks tipped with medium minnows at 11-12 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Creek</strong> (Indiana County) Austin Aikins, 18, had the stream to himself last week when he landed trout measuring 19, 23 and 25 inches using spinners. The senior at Central High School in Oakland was included on the 2020 Bassmaster High School All-State Fishing Team on Tuesday and in March signed a full athletic and academic scholarship to attend Bethel University in St. Paul, Minn., as a member of the school’s bass fishing team.</p>
<p><strong>Pine Creek</strong> (Allegheny County) Gene Slevinski of Highland Park took a 19-inch rainbow trout on a Pecola's spinner. Derek Peluso of Ross limited out on trout near a bridge below North Park.</p>
<p><strong>Sewickley Creek</strong> (Westmoreland County) Alec Moran, 12, landed and released a big golden rainbow trout on 4-pound test line April 9. The fish went for a salmon egg. Often inaccurately called “palominos,” the orange fish are rainbow trout hatchery bred for their brightness. This year, the state Fish and Boat Commission stocked about 13,000 golden rainbows averaging 1½ pounds, 40% more than last year.</p>
