<h1>Cat lovers, unite: Submit a kitty video to help indie movie theaters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Here they come to save the day: Mighty cats are on their way.</p>
<p>You, too, can help save independent theaters with your cutie-pies, klutzes and coldly calculating kitties.</p>
<p>Row House Cinema in Lawrenceville is asking for your 30-second cat videos to compete to become part of a full-length film, titled “Quarantine Cat Film Festival.”&nbsp;When all is done and distributed online, 50% of ticket sales go directly to the theater, through Row House’s Online Cinema Portal.</p>
<p>The project is aimed at helping movie theaters nationwide.&nbsp;Everyone who submits a video will compete for cash prizes, to be judged in four categories: Cutest, Funniest, Bravest and Most Loving. There will be a Best of Show award as well. Theaters request that videos be in a horizontal orientation. Deadline is May 8; learn more at&nbsp;<a href="https://rowhouse.online/cats/" target="_blank">https://rowhouse.online/cats/</a>.</p>
<p>“Our customers are at home with their kitties. What we need is for everyone to film their cats doing amazing things, then send us the videos. This will bring us the revenue we need to reopen,” says theater owner Brian Mendelssohn of Row House Cinema.</p>

<p>When we were gathering in late February, Row House held the 2020 #CatVideoFest, a 70-minute reel of cat videos, culled from thousands of submissions every year. A portion of the proceeds went to local cat charities.&nbsp;</p>
