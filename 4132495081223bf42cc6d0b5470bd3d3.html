<h1>MLB adjusts COVID-19 policy, encourages players to leave spring facilities</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As of Saturday night, approximately 40 major league players remained at the Pirates’ spring training facility — LECOM Park in Bradenton, Fla.</p>
<p>That number should drop soon, as Major League Baseball sent a memo to all 30 clubs Sunday updating its policy for dealing with the COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic and encouraging players to go home.</p>
<p>MLB’s new policy basically says that, unless you’re rehabbing an injury or have another really good reason to stay at your team’s spring training site, it’s time to leave; informal workouts are discouraged, as MLB is trying to practice better social distancing.</p>
<p>“The strong recommendation from our infectious disease and public health experts is that the clubs should avoid all activities in which players congregate in significant numbers or are otherwise unable to practice the ‘social distancing’ protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” the statement reads.</p>
<p>“The risk of a player in a club facility contracting the virus is real, and we must implement protocols to protect the safety and well-being of our players and staff members. In addition, we must recognize that there is the potential for further federal and state restrictions that will impact our operations, including restrictions in travel.”</p>
<p>MLB included a few other things in its updated memo, which shouldn’t have a gigantic impact on the Pirates; they were in the middle of the pack when it came to how many guys they had sticking around the facility.</p>
<p>Non-roster players are to return to their offseason residences, as long as it’s feasible. If it’s not — maybe for an international guy or someone headed somewhere where COVID-19 is especially bad — the club should “work with the player to provide suitable accommodations.” If that player requires treatment for an injury, he may stay.</p>
<p>Players on 40-man rosters must be permitted to remain at spring training sites and are eligible to receive their spring training allowances, the memo said. Those workouts, again, will be on an individual basis only.</p>
<p>MLB commissioner Rob Manfred will hold a conference call at noon Monday to update clubs.</p>
