<h1>Buying Here: Linebacker’s house in Fox Chapel stacks up at $2.95 million</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What does a Steelers linebacker look for in a house?</p>
<p>Lots of room to roam, for starters. Nine thousand square feet of living space and 9.3 acres filled the bill for Ryan Shazier, his wife, Michelle, and two sons, Ryan Jr., 5, and Lyon,1½.</p>
<p>But now the seven-bedroom house at<strong> 2 Edgemoor Lane</strong> in Fox Chapel is on the market for $2.95 million (MLS No. 1445655) with Trudy Ward of the Ward Ley Team at Howard Hanna Real Estate Services (412-849-5767 or <a href="https://www.howardhanna.com/Property/Detail/2-EDGEMOOR-LANE-Fox-Chapel-PA-15238/Westpenn/1445655" target="_blank">www.howardhanna.com</a>). There is a virtual tour at <a href="https://www.propertypanorama.com/instaview-tour/wpn/1445655" target="_blank">www.propertypanorama.com</a>&nbsp;and tours can be arranged under COVID-19 guidelines.</p>
<p>When Mr. Shazier bought the house in July 2017, he said he was drawn by its size, open layout and entertainment areas, including a large, bright family room and a patio with an outdoor kitchen, bar and in-ground swimming pool.</p>
<p>“We loved how we could be in the kitchen or family room but still be together,” he said in a phone interview from Texas, where he and his family were staying with in-laws.</p>
<p>His family used the pool often, he said, especially when temperatures hovered near 90. “We went in every day. We all jumped in the pool.”</p>
<p>Ms. Ward said the pool and patio “definitely add some value right now,” with many public pools closed and families staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The real estate agent noted that French doors from the family room lead directly to the patio and it’s just a few steps up to the pool.</p>
<p>“It’s resort-like, the whole package,” she said.</p>
<p>The house, which was built in 1990, has a first-floor master suite, seven full bathrooms -- one in the pool house -- and two powder rooms. Mr. Shazier said the space and multiple bedrooms came in handy when friends and family visited.</p>
<p>“I like to play video games. The game room is upstairs and I could go up and be by myself.”</p>
<p>There is a two-story entry with a marble floor and high ceilings with clerestory windows in the family room and master suite.</p>
<p>“We loved the aesthetics of the house,” Mr. Shazier said. “We were looking all over Pittsburgh. We saw that house and fell in love.”</p>
<p>One of his favorite places is the kitchen, which has bronze appliances from Sub-Zero, Miele and Dacor. Mr. Shazier said he likes to cook, especially barbecue, ribs, spaghetti and chicken Parmesan. The family often gathered to eat together at the large center island, then headed to the family room for TV or board games, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Shazier bought this house five months before he suffered a severe spinal injury while making a tackle in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals in December 2017. He has since made an amazing recovery but is unlikely to play football again. Earlier this year, the Steelers placed him on the reserve/retired list.</p>
<p>He is a shareholder and partner with Alba Tull, wife of Steelers minority owner Thomas Tull, in Ramp ’N’ Rize, a high-tech, boutique fitness studio that opened in Sewickley in May 2019. That explains why this house has space for a workout area but no equipment.</p>
<p>The property’s assessment is $2.27 million. No homes have sold on Edgemoor Lane since Mr. Shazier bought this one for $2.6 million in July 2017 (<a href="/(http:/www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/Default.aspx" target="_blank">www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/Default.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>Mr. Shazier said he and his wife very much want to remain in Fox Chapel but are looking to downsize. “We love this area. We want something that’s not quite as big, something that’s family-friendly.”</p>
<p>This house would be perfect for a large family, he said. “Anyone would be happy here.”</p>
