<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 03.18.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi folks. Welcome to my weekly chat. Thanks for participating. We'll get going around noon.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Sunner in Orlando</strong>: Hey Jason! If this is a truly rebuilding season,why don't the Bucs keep Tucker with the Big club and start him at short to see if he is the future there; move Newman to second and put Frazier at third for a better defensive lineup. Then at the trade deadline, move Moran or Frazier for future pieces. What say you? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: And away we go ... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey Rick. I would not move Frazier, who was a Gold Glove finalist at second base last year, then look to move him. That's not how that works. I would look to move him, for sure, but I'd want to increase his value by keeping him at second base, not moving him and potentially ruining the progress he made. Also, Kevin Newman earned the right to play last year, not the right to be moved to second base because someone who has never consistently hit major league pitching can play every day. (And I really like Cole Tucker; he simply hasn't done enough yet to displace Newman, and he'd be the first to tell you that.) <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: While this year should be about rebuilding or progress or getting better -- I don't care what you call it -- I don't see how the moves you suggested make sense; they merely complicate the equation.</p>
<p><strong>Les</strong>: I love the Pirates but how can I continue being a fan of the team when there is little or no effort in spending the money to one day possibly being a contender?? It's so frustrating!! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know, Les. It's not my job to convince you to be a Pirates fan. That's a personal thing. If you're put off by their lack of spending, root for someone who spends. I understand why they believe they're a small-market team and agree with it to an extent, although I've said many times here, I, too, wish they were spending more. Or, if they can't, I wish Nutting would sell to someone who is willing to plunk more of his own cash down on the major league product. That being said, a failure to spend does not mean you automatically stink. Plenty of other MLB clubs are doing the small-market thing much better than the Pirates have of late. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: ***Should also add that I like this new regime. I think the Pirates have a very good chance of looking more like the Rays or A's with Cherington/Sanders/Shelton/Kelly/Marin in place than they were before.</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: Can MLB and other owners force Nutting to spend more $$ and try to be competitive? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They could try and institute a salary cap or floor, which I think they should do. But given the current rules that are in place -- read: not very many -- no. As much as it angers people in Pittsburgh, he's not breaking any rules. It's Major League Baseball's economic system -- whacked out as it is -- that it allows for this stuff. I don't think Nutting is pocketing money hand over fist the way many perceive, but I also think there should be only so low (and high) teams should be allowed to go.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: thanks for the chats...when we do start playing ball again what rule changes will be in place and have the most impact? Never sure which ones they test in spring training versus those that apply to regular season <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey Jeff. My pleasure. I think the three-batter rule would have the most impact; however, I'm curious to see what rule changes look like when they do start playing games again. The three-batter minimum seems like a big ask for pitching staffs that might have to get ready in a hurry. Similarly, I'll be curious to see if they permit larger rosters to cover for pitchers who are maybe only built up for 3-4 innings. I think there's a great deal that could be new, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>Sean Tischler</strong>: Jason, do you think there is a point where Nutting gets enough pressure from the fanbase to actually spend money and try to win? I've heard in the past he's the 10th richest owner and clearly has the shortest arms and deepest pockets I can ever recall. It's got to be especially difficult with the Pens &amp; Steelers being at the very top of well run organizations who strive to win in all of sports. Also, doesn't it make it incredibly depressing to cover this joke of a team? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi, Sean. To your second point: not at all. It's such a misconception among fans that beat writers are also fans. We're not. They win, we write. They lose, we write. Trust me, it gets beaten out of you pretty quickly because this becomes work. I think we should always maintain a sense of awe or amazement and try our best to think like a fan, but I honestly don't care what the Pirates do, the same as I didn't care what the Penguins do. I just want to avoid rain delays, overtime/extra innings and late lead changes. Those three things complicate my job, not whether the Pirates fail to spend money or the Penguins give up a bunch of odd-man rushes. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: The only thing that changes is the way you cover the team. With Penguins fans, yinz are happy and want to read about all the good things happening over there. Cool. I've found that people still care a great deal about the Pirates, too. Our web numbers and the participation in this chat bear that out, even though I hear often that they don't care. Anyway, Pirates fans are pissed. They want the coverage to be more critical -- and I get why. But it has nothing to do on my end with wins and losses. It's more about knowing your audience. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: On Nutting, my sense is he learned his lesson from the last time the Pirates were good. They need to do more to sustain winning than they did in 2013-15. They need to evolve. I truly believe that once Cherington/Shelton/etc. get this turned around, Nutting will spend. You might disagree on that being the right order of operations here, and I can't disagree with you. But I do think he will legitimately try to grow the payroll with this group.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: When the season starts if Brault is healthy, do you see him being the LH out of the bullpen and Holland to the rotation? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Interesting question, Bill. I think I do, yeah. I guess almost by default, just because, all things being equal, yeah, Holland was better in spring training. But I do think pitching staffs might be different with the new constraints here. Maybe it makes sense to use a six-man rotation and only pitch guys 3-4 innings, at least to start. Will be interesting to hear what Shelton has to say on the topic tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: Be honest. Bob Nutting wouldn't have paid the out of work workers if MLB didn't force him ? He doesn't care about them <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think he and the Pirates would have done something. I think Bob Nutting is extremely cautious with his purchases. I think maybe too cautious in some cases, especially for an owner of a pro sports teams, a guy fans look to to act out of emotion and take some chances that someone in the business world probably wouldn't take. But he's not the heartless [person] many people think he is."</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: Pirates still lose 100+ even with the May start ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think so, but you may want to temper all of the enthusiasm you're bringing to this space today, Colts Corral. I'm afraid it may be rubbing off on others.</p>
<p><strong>Shawn</strong>: I mean, are we kinda kidding ourselves thinking there's going to be baseball this year? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think there will be baseball this year. Even if they start in July, shoot, you could still play 81 and have playoffs. Plus, I'm just refusing to think like that. Maybe I'm idiot -- which I prove out in other ways, too -- but I want to believe that we're gonna get back to normal sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><strong>Shawn</strong>: Also, while it's a nice gesture, but does $1 million really even make a dent in lost wages for ballpark employees? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yes. I would think so. Let's say there are 500 people who work at PNC Park, to whom this money is headed. That's $2,000 per person. A June start would mean 26 home games lost. Get about $77/game. (It's probably more toward $100, but still). My point is that, yeah, I do think it'll make a dent.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: So after they trade Bell does Bob Nutting become the face of the franchise ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Nutting is already the face of the franchise in some ways, and it's too bad for the players, for people like Bell and Jameson Taillon, Joe Musgrove, Bryan Reynolds, Kevin Newman, etc. If they were better and spent more, people could focus on them instead of him, which is how it should be.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Martin-Bucs Fan in GA</strong>: Jason, Appreciate your time and efforts regarding our Battling Buccos! I am really pumped with what took place in ST. I really think that change was needed and I believe the players have embraced the change. Unfortunate the Corona Virus has prevented ST from continuing. However, what do you see happening once the season picks back up. Will they pick up where they stopped in playing the ST games? Or will they make their final cuts and take that team north and play a series of Exhibition games at PNC? Man, this no baseball thing is terrible. I understand that life goes on, but it doesn't seem logical for it to be spring and no baseball and no Pirates! Beat'em Bucs <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey Terry. I see them picking up the schedule on whatever date baseball returns. If it's May 26, say, I think the Pirates will start with a game in Cincinnati. I just think with the unpredictable start time, and the fact that you probably want to get going as quickly as possible, it makes more sense than creating an entirely new schedule. At this point, too, I think we can probably ditch any realistic hope of playing 162 and adding the missed games onto the back end of the schedule. I just don't see how you do that and finish in any sort of reasonable fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: I would disagree. I know people that work for his newspapers and say he makes Henry Clay Frick look like Art Rooney. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You disagree? No way!</p>
<p><strong>Gregg</strong>: Has there been any indications on what could happen with roster decisions, service, compensation--i.e. practical matters--even discussions not worth reporting yet, or is it just been safety at the moment? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Not a ton, honestly. There has been a decent amount of back-and-forth with MLB and MLBPA regarding that stuff. As such, there hasn't been much of anything to report. I am expecting more details to come out in the coming days.</p>
<p><strong>Gregg</strong>: It's completely possible that someone misses an opportunity--say Derek Holland--because another player (Brault) will now be healthy to start the season, right? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't see that happening. I think Holland did enough to start the season as the fifth starter. Does he stay? Do they have a sixth starter? I think that's what we need to determine. An interesting scenario will be if Holland struggles. Do they switch him and Brault? They need a lefty in the 'pen, so I definitely see Brault getting that chance, unless they decide to go with a six-man rotation because the season start will be non-traditional. It might make sense to use a six-man rotation in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Gerald</strong>: Hi Jason, I heard on 937 the fan the pirates had interest in bringing Jeff Locke back as the 5th starter, is there any truth to that? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Haha. Good one. Dude hasn't pitching anywhere since 2017. Believe he's retired. I don't think so.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: What pop culture are you catching up on with the increase in free time? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Ha. None, Josh. I'm horribly uncool. I've been spending more time with the family, trying to figure out how to work from home and trying to continue to generate content. My wife and I like watching standup comedy, so we've watched some Sebastian Maniscalco and Dave Chappelle. We also watched "A Star is Born" (her choice) and a documentary called "Bluebird" (my choice) about the songwriter club in Nashville. But pop culture? I wouldn't call it that.</p>
<p><strong>Sean Tischler</strong>: Do you think Josh Bell gets traded this year? What kind of return would you expect if so? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think he gets traded this year. Maybe this offseason, but not this season, in part because of the delayed start. It's also too early to speculate on potential return. We don't even know what we're trading, so it's kinda hard to say what they might be able to get.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Nesbitt had a good look at this, but how detrimental do you think this layoff is going to be to the Pirates' current plans? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I haven't read Stephen's piece. He's a friend and a great dude, but I simply don't read the competition. Messes with my head. My initial thoughts are ... not terribly detrimental. They can put the time to good use. They also need to turn some of their current assets into more assets in the future -- I.e. flipping Archer, Kela and a few others for prospects. They can still do that. It will certainly change some things, but I don't see it being "detrimental" in any way. I was never looking for the Pirates to content for the division or a playoff spot this season, but I took think they can take some steps forward and flirt with .500. That's still attainable.</p>
<p><strong>Patricia</strong>: Jason, do you think that at any time Cherington has flatly told Nutting "dude, you GOTTA open your wallet a little"? Not so much for free agents, but to keep players here (Reynolds, Bell, Newman). <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know if he phrased it like that, but I don't doubt the issue has come up, either with Cherington or Travis Williams. That's one of the reasons why I believe Nutting will operate differently in the future. No way those guys -- who worked for teams that spent -- would come here and be OK with not doing that, especially Travis, who was at the complete opposite end of the spectrum with the Penguins. I think they believe that things are going to be different, and my guess is the three of them have had conversations about how to make them different (I.e. spend more).</p>
<p><strong>Scotty</strong>: I feel bad for Hunter Strickland, but transactions aren't currently frozen, are they? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They are not, at least not as I type this. Agree with you, though. That stinks.</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: Anybody pick up Jung Ho ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think Milwaukee tried, but there was some issue with his Work Visa and working in another state, something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Scotty</strong>: Would Pirates be more or less likely to make the postseason in a wonky, shortened season? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Interesting question, Scotty. I suppose numbers-wise, it benefit them? If a team is predicted to fare worse, I guess technically that would reduce the possibility for error. But realistically, if they made the playoffs, there wouldn't be much of a statistical projector for that anyway.</p>
<p><strong>rs</strong>: With new ownership, will there be a change in the progression through the minors for younger players. Former ownership would keep players in minors until they were 25, 26 and always brought up super 2. I have never seen super 2 affect any pirate player ever so if a guy is doing well in the minors will we get to see him sooner? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think so. I think the new group will -- and should -- have a strong handle on how to develop guys well, something Cherington oversaw in Boston. That should drive this more than anything. So, yeah, I do think it will change some. Although Super 2 is not just a Pirates issue. It's a strategy in place around baseball for a reason, so I think it's always going to be something people in charge think about. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. Looks like that's going to do it for this week. Thanks, as always, for participating. Will talk to you again next Wednesday.</p>
