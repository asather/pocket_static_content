<h1>Allegheny County reports first flu death</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The first death in Allegheny County of this year’s unusually early and intense flu season was reported Wednesday by the Allegheny County Health Department.</p>
<p>The victim was an unnamed 90-year-old resident who had&nbsp;“underlying medical conditions,” according to the county’s press release.</p>
<p>“We have seen a larger number of flu cases this year compared to last year at this time, particularly Type B flu,” Dr. Kristen Mertz, the county epidemiologist said in the press release.&nbsp;“Despite the increase in overall cases, less than 1% of reported flu cases resulted in hospitalizations. It’s still too early this flu season to make any predictions or speculate what’s to come.”</p>
<p>The county has been the state’s hot spot for flu cases so far this year, with more than 5,000 confirmed cases, and 34 hospitalizations, through this past Friday, according to Pennsylvania Department of Health Statistics. Those 5,000 cases represent about 20% of the state’s 25,362 confirmed cases statewide, where 13 other flu deaths had already been reported outside of Allegheny County.</p>
<p>By comparison, by the same point last year, Allegheny County had only reported 128 flu cases, 8 hospitalizations, and no deaths.</p>
<p>In Wednesday’s press release, Dr. Mertz reiterated the recommendations during flu season:</p>
<p>“Residents should call their health care provider as soon as possible if they’re experiencing flu symptoms (fever, muscle aches, cough, sore throat and fatigue) to determine if antiviral drugs should be prescribed. Antivirals can reduce severity of illness and are recommended for those at high-risk for flu complications: the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and persons with chronic medical conditions. This medication works best if started within two days of onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>“The best way to fight the flu is to get vaccinated. While the effectiveness of this year’s vaccine has not yet been determined, it’s very important to get a flu shot every year. Not only does it protect you from getting sick, it can protect you from spreading the flu to your loved ones and those that cannot be vaccinated. It’s never too late to get a flu shot and we encourage residents to get one if they haven’t already done so.</p>
<p>“To prevent flu transmission, you should also wash your hands frequently, cough or sneeze into your elbow or shoulder and not your hands and stay at home if you’re sick.”</p>
