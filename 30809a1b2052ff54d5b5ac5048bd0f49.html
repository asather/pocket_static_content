<h1>World briefs: Pompeo backs&nbsp; Zelenskiy in Ukraine visit; Taliban carries out record high attacks; Aussie capital under threat from forest fire</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stood beside Ukraine’s president Friday and promised that the U.S. would “not waver” in its support for the country as it battles Russian-backed separatists in its eastern region.</p>
<p>“Today I’m here with a clear message: The United States sees that the Ukrainian struggle for freedom, democracy and prosperity is a valiant one,” he said. “Our commitment to support it will not waver.”</p>
<p>The message from Mr. Pompeo came as the Senate continued its impeachment trial of President Donald Trump on the basis that the president conditioned U.S. military and diplomatic support for Ukraine on an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Mr. Pompeo denied that the Trump administration set such an investigation as a condition for a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. But he could not offer a date when the two countries would arrange an Oval Office sit-down between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelenskiy.</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials have desperately sought such a meeting with Mr. Trump since Mr. Zelenskiy, a former comedian with no political experience, won the presidency in spring 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Taliban carries out record high attacks</strong></p>
<p>The Taliban and other groups carried out a record number of attacks in Afghanistan during the last several months of 2019, according to an inspector general report released Friday. The increase in violence occurred during a period in which President Donald Trump tweeted that the U.S. was “hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!”</p>
<p>The number of attacks — detailed in the quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a government watchdog formed in 2008 — highlights once more the disparity between talking points on suppressing the Taliban and the reality on the ground: Despite a concerted bombing campaign and U.S. and Afghan offensive-ground operations, Taliban fighters are still able to attack at levels similar to those a decade ago.</p>
<p>The Taliban and other armed groups carried out 8,204 attacks in the final quarter of the year, 37% of which inflicted casualties, according to the report.</p>
<p>U.S. and Taliban negotiators restarted peace talks in December and are once more close to agreeing on a deal, U.S. officials say, although the negotiations have been bogged down as the two sides wrestle over how to reduce violence in order to move the peace process forward.</p>
<p><strong>Aussie capital under threat from forest fire</strong></p>
<p>The Australian capital region declared a state of emergency on Friday because of an out-of-control forest fire burning erratically to its south.</p>
<p>It’s the first fire emergency for the Australian Capital Territory area since 2003, when wildfires killed four people and destroyed almost 500 homes in a single day.</p>
<p>The threat is posed by a blaze on Canberra’s southern fringe that has razed more than 53,000 acres since it was sparked by heat from a military helicopter landing light Monday, the Emergency Services Agency said.</p>
<p>“The state of emergency sets a clear expectation for our community that we need you to be vigilant,” Emergency Services Minister Mick Gentleman said. “This is the worst bushfire season in the ACT since 2003.”</p>
<p>Unprecedented fires across southern Australia have claimed at least 33 lives since September, destroyed more than 3,000 homes and razed more than 26.2 million acres.</p>
