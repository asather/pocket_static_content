Their footsteps crunched in the two-inch snowfall illuminated by their headlights. At an elevation of nearly 17,800 feet, they breathed air so thin it contained half as much oxygen as at sea level.</p><p>Last year, she and her husband, David, attempted to climb Mount Blanc, the highest mountain in Western Europe. But on Oct. 20, she and her guide, Subash Vihimire, celebrated the completion of the Annapurna Circuit, one of the most famous treks in the world, by running the last 35 feet to the top of the Himalayan mountain.</p><p>“When you cross those passes and see surrounding mountains covered with snow, the beauty is awesome,” said Ms. Barndollar, 60, of Bethel Park. “You feel like you’re almost on top of the world.”</p><p>What makes her adventures so noteworthy is that she has Type 1 diabetes, a disease in which the body does not properly process food for energy. She embarks yearly on adventures that test not only her physical endurance at an age when many Americans think of slowing down but also her ability to manage a potentially deadly disease.</p><p>“Challenging yourself to climb to a high altitude like the Himalayas, even for a young person, is a big challenge,” said Ms. Barndollar’s physician, Dr. Jamil Alkhaddo, with the Allegheny Health Network. “I don’t think she looks at herself as a diabetic. She’s ready to take on any challenge that comes her way.”</p><p><strong>Finding the energy</strong></p><p>Climbing mountains could be especially taxing for diabetics because it requires a lot of energy. Most of the food that people eat becomes glucose or sugar and is converted into energy. The pancreas secretes the hormone insulin to help glucose get into the cells of the body. In the case of diabetics, the body does not make insulin or use it effectively.</p><p>More than 30 million Americans have diabetes, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those, 95% have Type 2 diabetes, and the remaining 5%, like Ms. Barndollar, have the more serious Type 1 diabetes.</p><p>The CDC reports that diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke and can result in kidney failure, blindness and deadening of the nerves, which can lead to amputation of a toe, a foot or a leg.</p><p>Ms. Barndollar first learned she had diabetes at age 6. For decades, she gave herself daily injections of insulin. As technology improved treatment of the disease, she switched to wearing a pump that automatically injects insulin into her body.</p><p>But her husband, who had hiked in Nepal before they met, warned her of the country’s poor hygiene. Concerned that she might get an infection from using a dirty pump, she decided instead to give herself injections of insulin four times a day.</p><p><strong>The Annapurna Circuit</strong></p><p>Hiking the Annapurna Circuit gave the Barndollars a measure of satisfaction. Last year, as they climbed Mount Blanc, the couple had to spend the night in a hut too far from the top to allow them enough time to reach the summit. Their French guide told them they had to quit their ascent.</p><p>“You hate to go on a trek and not do what you set out to do,” Ms. Barndollar said.</p><p>Unlike Mount Blanc, the Annapurna Circuit is not technical, but there is somerisk. The travel guide Lonely Planet reports that trekkers have died on Thorong La because of altitude sickness, exposure, cold and avalanches.</p><p>The potential for danger was made evident in October 2014 when nearly six feet of snow fell in the region in 12 hours, killing 43 people, including 23 hikers on the Annapurna Circuit.</p><p>The Barndollars hiked the 100-mile Annapurna Circuit over 15 days. Mr. Barndollar has an irregular heartbeat that makes hiking at high altitude difficult, and he was recovering from surgery on a torn meniscus. As a result, he did not try to summit Thorong La. Instead, he hiked with one of their two porters, Arjun Vihimire, at a lower altitude.</p><p>Mr. Barndollar was pleased, however, that he managed to hike about 13,300 feet high.</p><p>The couple spent nights at tea houses and lodges. During the day they hiked past stunning vistas of the highest mountain range in the world. They spun Buddhist prayer wheels on a trail festooned with prayer flags and visited vibrantly painted Buddhist monasteries.</p><p>While on the trail, the Barndollars and their guide took a break on a bamboo swing. A line of villagers clapped their approval. And in the tea houses Ms. Barndollar astonished her Nepalese crew by eating the same hot peppers that they ate with no ill effect.</p><p>Despite her diabetes, the only physical problem Ms. Barndollar had was an irritated cornea from dust onthetrail. She went to a hospital where a doctor corrected the problem by giving her an antibiotic and moisturizing eyedrops.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest threat that Ms. Barndollar dodged came not from cold or snow but from mice.</p><p>She went to bed before her ascent of Thorong La and heard a strange noise in the middle of the night. Her husband compared the sound to “crinkling a bag.”</p><p>She opened her backpack and investigated. Mountain mice had nibbled the tuna fish, granola bars and fruit gummies inside a plastic bag and left a telltale sign — poop.</p><p>That might seem like a mere annoyance, but diabetics need snacks to maintain the proper level of blood sugar. If she did not eat enough carbohydrates, Dr. Alkhaddo said, “she could pass out.”</p><p>And the top of a mountain is not a good place to pass out.</p><p><strong>‘She did good’</strong></p><p>In a telephone interview from Nepal, her guide praised the pace Ms. Barndollar set. “She was pretty fast, more than I expected,” Mr. Vihimire said. “Sometimes, I had to slow her down.”</p><p>Because of the seriousness of her disease and all the medicine she was taking, he at first doubted that she would reach the summit. “I thought it might be a problem at the high elevation, but she did good,” he said.</p><p>Back at their home, the couple said they learned something from their trip.</p><p>”I missed Ginny when we weren’t together,” Mr. Barndollar said.</p><p>Likewise, his wife said she missed hiking with him after they split up. “I realized that you can do it by yourself,” she said, “but it’s nicer to do it with somebody you want to be with.”</p><p>Ms. Barndollar said she also learned that people should not be afraid to challenge themselves just because they’re older.</p><p>“I’ve had diabetes for 54 years,” she said. “With appropriate training and determination, anybody can do anything.”</p><p><em>Bill Zlatos, freelance writer: suburbanliving@post-gazette.com.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2020/01/03/Bethel-Park-woman-confronts-mountainous-challenges/stories/202001030007</original_url>
