<h1>Tuition freeze approved across Pa.'s 14 state-owned universities</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The board overseeing Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities voted Wednesday to freeze tuition systemwide for 2020-21 and tentatively approved a 1% increase for the year after that. It was also briefed on potential fall semester changes due to ongoing COVID-19 health concerns.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s vote marked the first time the State System of Higher Education has set two years of tuition over its nearly four-decade history, but the move was overshadowed in part by a pandemic that stands to compound enrollment losses and financial woes across the universities and their 96,000 students.</p>
<p>Plans to save $250 million are now slated to be accomplished in two to three years, instead of five, officials said. During the meeting, the board signed off on a wave of new retirement incentive programs for several unions and agreed to open the initiatives to non-union-represented workers, expediting an existing effort to pare the workforce and share academic and other programs.</p>
<p>“What we are doing is greatly accelerating that plan,” said board Chairwoman Cynthia Shapira.</p>
<p>Many State System students and high school seniors eyeing one of those campuses are watching to see how the fall semester could be impacted. They received a partial answer Wednesday.</p>
<p>State System officials confirmed they are preparing for multiple scenarios, from in-person classes to remote options. The system already expects another decline in students, 3.6%, but is planning for as much as a 10% enrollment reduction, said Chancellor Daniel Greenstein.</p>
<p>After the meeting, spokesman David Pidgeon described the range of scenarios, saying a decision is still four to five weeks away.</p>
<p>“A whole range of options are being considered, and choices will be driven first by the health and safety of the campus community, and then within that context, how can instruction be best provided,” he said. “(It) could be in-class, could be multi-modal, could be remote instruction.</p>
<p>“A lot on the table. We’re closely attentive to the governor and the state Department of Health’s guidance on this, too,” he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, University of Pittsburgh chancellor Patrick Gallagher said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/04/16/Pitt-academic-calendar-university-students-Pittsburgh-fall-semester-coronavirus/stories/202004160183" target="_blank">“back to normal probably is not likely” this fall</a>&nbsp;at his institution. Officials there are weighing hybrid options including fewer students on campuses in dorms to avoid an all-or-nothing choice between continuing online only instruction and returning fully to in-person classes.</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon President Farnam Jahanian <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/04/28/Carnegie-Mellon-University-fall-delayed-start-COVID-19-cmu-salary-furloughs/stories/202004280074" target="_blank">suggested those options</a> or possibly delaying fall semester by two to six weeks to better gauge public health risk. Penn State University <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/04/27/Penn-State-Eric-Barron-Pitt-Gallagher-salary-furloughs-jobs-pandemic-COVID-19/stories/202004270079" target="_blank">also is looking at various options for the upcoming semester.</a></p>
<p>Total enrollment across the 14 universities peaked at just under 120,000 in 2010, but now sits just below 96,000. Population loss and fewer high school graduates have hit campuses in the western part of the state especially hard, though other factors including affordability have been cited as issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system’s base yearly rate for in-state students, which will remain at $7,716, is well less than half that charged by Pitt and Penn State, but is nearly 40 percent higher than a decade ago.</p>
<p>Room, board and other fees are additional, and several system schools charge per-credit tuition for full-time students, have scrapped a discounted flat tuition rate. Average total cost across the system is about $22,000.</p>
<p>In January, Mr. Greenstein <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/01/15/State-System-of-Higher-Education-Daniel-Greenstein-PASSHE-APSCUF-higer-education-Pennsylvania/stories/202001150102" target="_blank">argued for funding beyond the system’s regular appropriation</a> request. He said the first $20 million installment on $100 million was necessary beyond a 2% increase in the System’s 2020-21 state appropriation, to $487 million. It would help develop infrastructure to allow campuses to deliver academic programs jointly, to share services and to reach new student markets through greater emphasis on learning online.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the system’s board approved “Enhanced Sick Leave Payout” programs with various unions, similar to one that led 220 faculty to retire early.</p>
<p>They allow individuals to be paid for larger numbers of accrued sick days, and are being offered to members of:&nbsp;&nbsp;American Federation of State, County and&nbsp;Municipal Employees (AFSCME); Service Employees International Union, Local 668 (SEIU&nbsp;Local 668); Office and Professional Employees International Union Healthcare Pennsylvania&nbsp;(OPEIU); PASSHE Officers Association (POA); State College and University Professional&nbsp;Association (SCUPA); and International Union, Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of&nbsp;America (SPFPA).</p>
