<h1>City heads 'Downstairs' for a Pittsburgh theatrical reunion</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For better or worse, a past left unresolved is bound to bubble to the surface.</p>
<p>“Downstairs,” opening Saturday in previews at City Theatre, explores how history and memory — not necessarily the same thing — have paved a troubled path to the present for a brother and sister.</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> City Theatre, MainStage, 1300 Bingham St., South Side.</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Previews Jan. 11-16; then Jan. 17-Feb. 2. 7 p.m. Tuesday; 1 and/or 7 p.m. Wednesday; 8 p.m. Thursday-Friday; 1, 5:30 and/or 9 p.m. Saturday; and 2 or 7 p.m. Sunday (1 hour, 45 minutes with no intermission; complete listing: citytheatrecompany.org).</p>
<p><strong>Tickets:</strong>&nbsp;$29-$65 (under age 30, reserve $15 seats by phone); citytheatrecompany.org or 412-431-CITY (2489).</p>
<p>The history of Pittsburgh theater and director Marc Masterson’s fond memories of working with local acting royalty are key to why the play has landed at City to start the new year.</p>
<p>The 2019-20 season was the first planned by Masterson in his second stint as City artistic director, and “Downstairs” marks his directorial return to the MainStage.</p>
<p>Before a recent rehearsal, seated at a table with his cast of three — Helena Ruoti, Martin Giles and John Shepard — he sees not only longtime friends and colleagues but also decades of theater experience.</p>
<p>“This right here is the reason I came back to Pittsburgh,” he says. “I don’t want to have to think about going to Broadway [with a new show]. I want to do great work like this, with great Pittsburgh actors like these three.”</p>
<p>His cast for the domestic drama, by prolific playwright and screenwriter Theresa Rebeck (TV’s “Smash”), reunites the veteran actors.</p>
<p>They may portray a troubled family in the play, but these days, when the sound of laughter can be heard behind the rehearsal-room closed doors, being reunited feels so good.</p>
<p>The three actors last performed together in 2004 for then-Pittsburgh Irish &amp; Classical Theatre in “A Woman of No Importance.” Masterson left City in 2000, having worked at one time or another with all three, to become artistic director of Actors Theatre of Louisville — Giles joined him there in 2005 for a role in “The Crucible.”</p>
<p>Masterson comes to “Downstairs” with another connection — in his time away, including at South Coast Rep in Costa Mesa, Calif., he has directed or produced five of Rebeck’s previous plays.</p>
<p>She wrote this play for actor-siblings Tyne and Tim Daily.</p>
<p>“They worked together in her theatrical home in Vermont, so it was for people she knows,” Masterson says of their ties to the Dorset Playhouse.</p>
<p>And this coming together of director and actors has that same feeling of a family reunion.</p>
<p>“We’ve been talking about this — we represent 200 years of theater experience, with [scenic designer] Tony Ferrieri and [technical director] Paul Ford.”</p>
<p>Ruoti, whose recent work includes “A Doll’s House Part 2” at Pittsburgh Public Theater and “HER” at barebones, was happy not only to be with her comrades, “but just to see a script for people of our age,” she says.</p>
<p>“What’s great is that this is for an older brother and sister,” she says. “That’s something you just don’t see. I can’t think of another play that does that.”</p>
<p>“Downstairs” refers to the cluttered basement of the house her character, Irene, shares with her husband (Shepard). It’s where her younger brother, Teddy (Giles), has come to roost, much to her husband’s annoyance.</p>
<p>“She has to go down and talk to him because he told her she has to,” Ruoti explained. She isn’t happy to be faced with either man in her life — a husband who can be abusive and a brother who bears burdens she’d rather not dredge up.</p>
<p>“Between her husband and Teddy, it’s exhausting,” Ruoti says of poor, put-upon Irene.</p>
<p>“He’s very complicated,” Giles says of Teddy. “He says he has this great job that he’s about to start, but for now he’s looking for ‘a a a a haven,’ as he says. There are signs that he’s not quite right — signs of mental illness — but there’s a lot going on. ... I don’t want to say too much.”</p>
<p>Lurking upstairs, with his presence felt long before his entrance, is Shepard’s Gerry.</p>
<p>Teddy has come in search of some much-needed nurturing from his sister, but what they find is a confrontation with their family history that explodes the circumstances of the present.</p>
<p>“It’s about memory and going back to a place in the past that you haven’t gone to in a long while — not in just a few years, but a long, long time,” Ruoti says. “There are all these things they haven’t thought about or repressed, and now it’s coming out.”</p>
<p>What she has found in exploring the work with this group is a humor that may not be evident from the story.</p>
<p>“It’s funny!” she says insistently, and there are smiles all around</p>
<p>“This,” Masterson says again.&nbsp;“When it comes right down to it, this why I came back.”</p>
