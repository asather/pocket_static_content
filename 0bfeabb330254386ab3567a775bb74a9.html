<h1>Chartiers Valley superintendent outlines reopening plans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The superintendent of the Chartiers Valley School District outlined plans to welcome back students in the fall during the board’s June 16 meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">Superintendent Johanna Vanatta said the district “started reopening planning long before the state said we had to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">“We will do our best as we possibly can for our students and our community with this reopening to make sure we have a safe and secure environment,” Ms. Vanatta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Last month, the district convened a task force to evaluate, prepare and plan for reopening the school district, which has been closed since mid-March due to COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Ms. Vanatta said the district must follow guidance from the Pennsylvania Department of Education when formulating</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;a plan to reopen the school buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Chartiers Valley, like all districts in the state, must create a health and safety plan to establish local guidelines for reopening. That plan must be approved by the school board and then submitted to the state education department. The plan also will be published on the district’s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The district will establish a pandemic team and a pandemic coordinator with specific roles and responsibilities relative to preparedness and response to pandemic planning. Training will be scheduled with all faculty and staff on the implementation of the health and safety plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Ms. Vanatta pointed out the district is preparing for all three phases — red, yellow and green — in the event that the county would revert back to one of the earlier phases. Currently, Allegheny County is in the green phase of Gov. Tom Wolf’s reopening plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;" data-mce-mark="1">The district will be sending out a staff and community survey in the next week to gather further details for its reopening plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Ms. Vanatta said the plan also may include protocols for distancing in classrooms, guidelines for hygiene practices, guidelines for face coverings and protocols for identifying and restricting nonessential visitors and volunteers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Ms. Vanatta said she anticipates the task force will have a foundation of its reopening plans to the board by June 30. She said the district is working to create a reopening page on its website, www.cvsd.net.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">However, she pointed out the situation is fluid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">“I had the opportunity to speak with various professionals with the department of health today and they said and warned school districts, ‘you’re trying to plan for two months in advance when we can only plan for two weeks in advance,’” Ms. Vanatta said.</span></p>
