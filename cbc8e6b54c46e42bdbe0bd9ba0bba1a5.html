<h1>Catchers in demand as MLB players look to stay ready</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As Major League Baseball players have been encouraged/forced to leave spring training sites and either return home or go to where they hope to spend the summer playing baseball, Michael McKenry’s phone has been blowing up.</p>
<p>On Tuesday alone, five friends called or texted the former Pirates catcher, asking if he could catch a bullpen for them.</p>
<p>“Everybody is scrambling,” McKenry said.</p>
<p>McKenry, who had surgery to repair his ACL on Jan. 17, can’t do as much as he would like these days, although he said he loves baseball so much that he’s going to try and catch while squatting and his sticking his leg out straight for one or two guys on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The issue is more what McKenry said — that guys must figure out how to stay in shape, especially pitchers, as they try their best to stay ready. Similar to hockey and goaltenders, that means available catchers are a hot commodity.</p>
<p>“Guys can’t take 2-3 weeks off then ramp back up,” McKenry said. “I told my wife [Jaclyn], if that was me, I’d probably break into a university or something. They couldn’t me keep me out.</p>
<p>“It’s your livelihood. Especially if you’re a minor league guy, you’re not making any money, you have time on your hands, you have to do something because once they say go, they’re not going to be like, ‘Oh, we’re going to take it really slow with you guys.’</p>
<p>“It’s going to be go time. You better be ready to go to spring training and get two or three weeks in and roll.”</p>
<p>Once the baseball season starts, McKenry will make Pittsburgh home, as the fan favorite was scheduled to work 160 games in some capacity, either as a color commentator for TV or radio or on AT&amp;T SportsNet’s pre- and postgame shows —&nbsp;at least before opening day was pushed back until mid-May or later.</p>
<p>For now, McKenry lives in Nashville and said he even had some middle school kids who had their season canceled ask if he could help them organize live batting practice.</p>
<p>The professional pitchers McKenry plans to catch Wednesday are good friends, as they work out at the same place where McKenry has been rehabbing his knee. The plan is to finish up and find an empty high school field in the area.</p>
<p>“I love it,” McKenry said. “If I wasn’t hurt, I would do it for 15 guys if they wanted it. Guys are leaving spring training. They’re just now getting back, and some guys are stuck. You have to figure that it’s either this or a wall.”</p>
<p><strong>Start it up</strong></p>
<p>Once we do flatten the curve and the coronavirus pandemic becomes a thing of the past — not soon enough for all of us — baseball will be left with a couple things to consider.</p>
<p>First will be how quickly it can restart and what that looks like. There’s a very real concern among pitchers about starting up too fast and what that might mean for the health of arms. It might actually make sense for MLB to expand rosters and allow teams to carry more pitchers.</p>
<p>But during that shortened spring training portion, here’s a suggestion: Why not hold it at teams’ home ballparks and allow fans who otherwise would never be able to travel to Florida or Arizona and give them a taste of what that would be like?</p>
<p>“I’d like to believe, if things go accordingly, we would get to a place where the weather would allow us to be in a place where we would actually have a minicamp within the cities,” said former Pirates first baseman Kevin Young, who’s now a special assistant in their baseball operations department.</p>
<p>“When you do that in the city, it would allow the fanbases to really get behind the feeling that, ‘OK, we have something to look forward to for those two weeks.’ I think there’s some energy there that would definitely happen.</p>
<p>“It would be a new thing, but so many people don’t get the opportunity to go down to Florida and see a spring training environment or a spring training practice.”</p>
<p>When games start, there would be an entirely new challenge: Does MLB pick up on, say, May 25 or 26 and play the schedule as is, or does it try to create a completely new one?</p>
<p>Logistically it might make the most sense to go the first route and either scrap the lost games or play them at the end of the year, but that would create a conundrum as it would change the competitive balance of the schedule.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say games started May 25-26 — accounting for the eight weeks off from mass gatherings recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Presentation and allowing two weeks to get ready.</p>
<p>The Pirates would have 54 games left against NL Central foes, while the Reds would have 61, the Cardinals 58, the Brewers 52 and the Cubs 51. Chicago and Milwaukee would have 18 and 17 interleague games remaining, respectively, while the other NL clubs would have 12.</p>
<p>The Pirates would have one more home game (55 to 54), while the Reds would have just 52 at Great American Ball Park and 57 on the road.</p>
<p>It’s doubtful that would be any sort of significant sticking point, but it does provide something to think about as MLB tries to figure out a way to play as much of the 2020 season as possible.</p>
