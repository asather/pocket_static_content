<h1>UPMC COVID-19 test site up and running</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The formal beginning of testing at UPMC’s South Side test site for COVID-19 started with a slow number of patients Tuesday morning — just six in the first two hours — and just one person who tried to get tested without a doctor’s order.</p>
<p>The creation of the test site in the former emergency room of the old South Side Hospital, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/14/covid-19-upmc-testing-coronavirus/stories/202003140044" target="_blank">announced on Saturday by UPMC</a>, is intended as a way for possibly infected people to be tested away from other hospitalized people and the public.</p>
<p>UPMC said it hoped to test up to 20 people a day the first few days, ramping up to about 100 people a day by the end of the week.</p>
<p>UPMC may have even started a day earlier than they announced.</p>
<p>Allegheny County said Tuesday that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/17/Allegheny-County-10-COVID-19-cases-coronavirus/stories/202003170092" target="_blank">it had one new confirmed case, and three new presumptive cases</a>.</p>
<p>The three presumptive cases were not classified yet as “confirmed,” the county said, because “they are from a lab that just started testing and require confirmation.”</p>
<p>UPMC’s lab is the only new lab operating in the region. The state’s lab, and four commercial labs – ARUP, Mayo, Quest Diagnostics and Lab Corp. – have all been up and running for awhile and no longer require confirmation.</p>
<p>UPMC would not comment about the lab or the test site Tuesday.</p>
<p>One of the first patients to show up at UPMC’s new COVID-19 test collection site at the former South Side Hospital Tuesday morning had a story that told a lot about the situation the country is in.</p>
<p>The woman, a college student who asked not to be named, was attending school in the United Kingdom – she would not say which part of the UK – until Thursday, when the school shut down.</p>
<p>She decided to fly home to Pittsburgh on Saturday, which is also when she started to feel ill with common COVID-19 symptoms: a cough and fever.</p>
<p>Despite coming from a country that is dealing with its own outbreak, and showing symptoms, she was able to go straight home after landing.</p>
<p>On Sunday, she called her primary care doctor’s office and because of her recent travel and symptoms, she got a referral to UPMC’s test site – a first step in the process of getting tested at UPMC’s site.</p>
<p>Later, her father took a call from a UPMC infectious control staffer who took down information from her father and approved her for testing Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Wearing a yellow facemask as she exited about 10 minutes after entering the test site, the woman continually coughed into her elbow, and warned a reporter to stay a safe distance away from her as she talked.</p>
<p>She said the process was quick and efficient, with staffers making sure she washed her hands with hand sanitizer before she came in, then that she was wearing a facemask, and before being led into one of the nine negative pressure rooms in the old emergency room.</p>
<p>In the emergency room, she was greeted by healthcare workers dressed in full gowns, gloves and a head-covering clear helmet with a respirator.</p>
<p>To the woman, it appeared they were wearing “hazmat suits,” she said. “It was weird. But I understood why.”</p>
<p>UPMC is using a nasal swab only to test patients at its site, rather than the three swabs — from nose, throat and sputum — the state was initially requiring, or even the two — just nose and throat — the state has more recently been requiring of samples it tests.</p>
<p>Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children’s Hospital, said at a press conference on Saturday that UPMC decided to just use the one sample from the nose because it “is the one that most often is positive” and tends to be the most accurate of the three samples.</p>
<p>The woman said she was told to expect results of her test within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Another patient who came to the UPMC test site, a woman in her 60s accompanied by her husband, said she came because she had symptoms and worked at the University of Pittsburgh, where she was worried she had contact with students who had recently traveled internationally.</p>
<p>“She probably doesn’t have it, but she’s just being careful,” her husband said.</p>
<p>A college-aged student came to the site to try to get tested without a doctor’s referral.</p>
<p>He said he was told “it wasn’t protocol” and quickly turned away by a security guard before he even entered the building.</p>
<p>UPMC’s test site was not the only site open on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On the other side of town, the Central Outreach Wellness Center in the North Shore, opened up a drive-through testing operation again on Tuesday, a day after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/16/Pittsburgh-COVID-19-coronavirus-screening-test-drive-thru-central-outreach-wellness-center/stories/202003160125" target="_blank">it took samples from 75 people in just 2½ hours</a>.</p>
<p>The nonprofit clinic got another 300 COVID-19 test kits in on Tuesday from Quest Diagnostics, the commercial lab that will do the testing. The nonprofit’s other two locations in Aliquippa and Washington also got more test kits Tuesday, but not nearly as many as the North Shore location.</p>
<p>Even before the clinic opened sample taking at 11 a.m. Tuesday, the line of cars snaked around the block and stayed that way for hours afterwards.</p>
<p>Most of the people in line gave sputum samples, which is a mixture of saliva and mucus coughed up by the respiratory tract.</p>
<p>That was because the swab that is used to take either a nasal or throat sample are in short supply, said Dr. Stacy Lane, the clinic’s founder who was taking samples herself among the long line of cars Tuesday.</p>
<p>The sputum sample is the easiest one to take, merely requiring a sample jar to hold it in.</p>
<p>“Any healthcare facility has the ability to be testing sputum,” Dr. Lane said.</p>
<p>But sputum samples are the least accurate and preferred among the three types, with nasal – it goes through to the back of the nose and actually gets it from the upper throat – being the best. The throat sample is the second best option, and sputum last, she said.</p>
<p>The clinic limited its use of the less plentiful and more accurate nasal or throat swabs to more high-risk and potentially critical patients, she said.</p>
<p>Many of the people in the line at the clinic had waited in their cars for upwards of 2 hours to get tested.</p>
<p>And even though some had mild symptoms, the word of the day from many was: “Better safe than sorry.”</p>
<p>“It’s not so much that we think it would be fatal for us,” said Jennifer Hartman, 33, who came to get tested with her husband, Nathaniel, 34. “We’re more worried about passing it on to someone else. His dad has COPD and we don’t want to harm him.”</p>
