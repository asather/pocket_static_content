<h1>FISA grants address systemic racism, women, people with disabilities </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A major component of FISA Foundation’s mission is to provide funding to help people with disabilities.</p>
<p>So when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the Downtown-based philanthropy became concerned that nonprofits that assist those individuals would be scrambling for money to buy masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>Agencies would also need to set up systems to provide remote education and therapy when schools and medical offices shut down.</p>
<p>“We really did worry about the impact of COVID-19 on our population,” said Kristy Trautmann, executive director of the Downtown-based philanthropy that focuses on funding initiatives that improve the lives of women and girls as well as people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The foundation awarded just over $1.4 million in grants during the fiscal year that ended June 30.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, it approved grants totaling more than $250,000 that include $55,000 to agencies that are helping people with disabilities cope with added challenges brought on by the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Among the grants was $10,000 to Global Links to procure and distribute clear face masks for people who are deaf or have other disabilities.</p>
<p>Other grants of $5,000 to $10,000 apiece are for agencies that provide teletherapy, residential care and other supports to people diagnosed with autism and other disorders.</p>
<p>FISA also approved $25,000 to help victims of domestic violence who may have been quarantined with abusive partners during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Women’s Center &amp; Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh will receive $20,000 for outreach and communications for victims of intimate partner violence; and Helping All Victims in Need will receive $5,000 for safe housing and support for victims of domestic violence in Armstrong County.</p>
<p>About half of the recent funding round aims to address systemic racism and was allocated to three nonprofits that focus on programs for Black women and girls.</p>
<p>Those grants include $52,500 to Gwen’s Girls to support professional development workshops for professionals who serve Black girls and for a campaign called See the Best in Me that allows Black girls to address issues such as leadership and inclusiveness.</p>
<p>Other grants that address racism are $45,000 to New Voices for Reproductive Justice, a nonprofit that advocates for Black women and girls, the LGBTQ community and other people of color; and $25,000 to the Black Women’s Policy Agenda, an initiative that is creating a policy to advance equity for Black women and girls in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>Other grants approved in the fourth quarter include $30,000 to Autism Connection for advocacy efforts and for training of police and others to work with people on the autism spectrum; $30,000 to Sisters Place, a Clairton agency that helps homeless parents and children; and $5,000 to the Pittsburgh Foundation’s COVID-19 Emergency Action Fund.</p>
