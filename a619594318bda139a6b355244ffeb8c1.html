<p>A press conference was held outside of Pittsburgh police headquarters at 11 p.m. Monday night to discuss the protest that occurred in East Liberty earlier that day.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, police Chief Scott Schubert, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich and other officials updated the public on how the protest in East Liberty turned violent, the current situation in East Liberty, how many protesters were arrested and the reasoning behind the use of riot-containment measures.</p>
<p>“I was there from 4 until 7, and what I saw was peace,” Mr. Peduto said. “But what happened from 7 to 8 was very different.”</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Peduto and others reiterated that the vast majority of protesters were peaceful, but that a small “splinter group” of outsiders turned the protest, which organizers ended around 7 p.m., into a more violent one.</p>
<p>Chief Schubert and other officials said that protesters began throwing rocks, bricks and water bottles at police, which prompted officers to use smoke, not tear gas, to disperse the crowd.</p>
<p>Mr. Hissrich said that nine officers were injured by the objects, but that all have been evaluated and released from the hospital.</p>
<p>Mr. Hissrich also said that 20 people were arrested following the protest, four of whom are not from Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Two protesters were also transported to the hospital and evaluated for their injuries, which officials said they got from bean bags.</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Peduto said that he ordered Chief Schubert to transcribe the police orders given and the timeline of events from 7 to 8 p.m. Monday evening, which&nbsp;Mr. Peduto, Chief Schubert and Mr. Hissrich will read over “line by line” Tuesday for inconsistencies.</p>
<p>If any inconsistencies are found,&nbsp;Mr. Peduto said, he will update the media and the public.</p>
