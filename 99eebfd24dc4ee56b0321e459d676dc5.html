<p>In another step to keep customers and employees safe from the COVID-19 virus, Port Authority will have all riders enter buses through the rear door beginning Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a news release Tuesday, the authority said riders will enter through the rear door and hold up their pre-paid ConnectCard or other product to show the driver. Cash customers will ride for free.</p>
<p>Riders who have to use the ramp or need priority seating can continue to use the front door.</p>
<p>There will be no change for riders on the light rail system.</p>

<p>The new policy begins as the authority institutes a 25% cut in service Wednesday. Most of the cuts will be to rush-hour service, where ridership has dropped dramatically due to companies that have closed or had employees work from home due to the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>“We are committed to the health and wellbeing of everyone in our community, and it is our belief that this small measure will go a long way,” said CEO Katharine Kelleman said in a news release. “While we continue to discourage anyone from going out who doesn’t have to, those who still need to are encouraged to use proper hygiene and maintain your distance from each other.”</p>
<p>The Butler Transit Authority instituted a similar policy on Monday as transit agencies take steps to continue providing service while protecting customers and employees.</p>
<p>Last week, Port Authority encouraged social distancing on transit vehicles by asking riders to sit away from the driver and from each other.</p>
