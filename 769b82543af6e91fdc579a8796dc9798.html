<p>After three months closed due to COVID-19, staffers at the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium have noticed that even the animals have missed the usual flow of onlookers inside the park.</p>
<p>When staffers walk by the flamingo exhibit, for example, they notice the tropical birds getting excited, said Brittany Balandis, the director of marketing and communications.</p>

<p>The flamingos will get back to something resembling normal on Friday, though, with the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium in Highland Park set to reopen to the public with a new timed ticketing system, part of a series of modifications in place to ensure the health and safety of staffers and visitors.</p>
<p>“The staff is so excited to get back to somewhat normalcy, and we know the animals are, too,” Ms. Balandis said. “We’re very excited to bring visitors back to see our animals.”</p>
<p>For zoo members, the timed tickets are complimentary. Tickets for non-members will cost $17.95 for adults, $16.95 for seniors and $15.95 for children. While the entry times are spaced out, there isn’t a requirement for how long visitors can remain inside the park.</p>
<p>“We’ve worked it out that they’re timed so far apart that it works out with the limited capacity,” Ms. Balandis said.</p>
<p>In addition to the staggered entry times for zoo guests, the playground areas, log ride and zip line will all continue to be closed. There will be no tram service, either, and there will be a single flow of traffic and single queuing lines.</p>
<p>The zoo also installed plexiglass barriers throughout the park, as well as social distancing markers, two precautions that go together with continual cleaning.</p>
<p>“We’ve upped our game with cleaning, for sure,” Ms. Balandis said. “We’re saying we have continuous cleaning because it truly is continuous. It’s throughout the entire day, doesn’t stop. We are just cleaning and sanitizing all day, every day.”</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium is largely operated through visitor revenue, so Ms. Balandis said being closed for three months has been “tremendously difficult.” The 7,000 animals still need to be cared for, even without people entering to view them.</p>
<p>The zoo formed an emergency operating fund, raising funds that go directly to caring for the animals. In addition, the zoo hosted several events to raise money, such as the Zoofari Drive-Thru and an upcoming virtual happy hour.</p>
<p>Still, Ms. Balandis said, the zoo has missed out on “a lot” of revenue.</p>
<p>So now, with the opportunity to reopen the park in a limited capacity Friday, park employees and flamingos alike are excited to finally see visitors once more.</p>
<p>“This has been a long, hard process,” Ms. Balandis said. “… So we are so excited to reopen.”</p>
