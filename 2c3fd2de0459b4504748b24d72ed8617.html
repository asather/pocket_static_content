<h1>Steelers confident in their NFL draft prep despite new limitations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said he is more than comfortable with his preparedness for the NFL draft that starts Thursday, even though his face-to-face visits and evaluations with prospects has been limited because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The travel restrictions and social distancing imposed by the league have given Tomlin even more time to watch film, something he does fervently, on draft prospects.</p>
<p>“I feel good from a preparedness standpoint,” Tomlin said on Monday. “The value I place on that tape, I’ve really had a good opportunity to delve in that, maybe more so than usual.”</p>
<p>In a Zoom conference call with Pittsburgh-area media on Monday, general manager Kevin Colbert said the Steelers do not have 40-yard dash times on 74 players and have incomplete physicals on 76 players. However, Colbert said they have 40 times on every wide receiver — a position of significant interest for the Steelers — they might consider in the draft.</p>
<p>Colbert said the Steelers have interviewed 125 players since the Senior Bowl, including 45 at the NFL combine and another 37 on FaceTime.</p>
<p>“I just watched more tape on the same number of players I usually watch,” Tomlin said. “I’ve had an opportunity to come back and look at another game or two on players we’re discussing. It’s providing an opportunity to take a deeper dive. There’s additional comfort from that perspective.”</p>
<p>Tomlin said he is not “fretting” about not having a No. 1 pick in the draft — “That first pick was Minkah Fitzpatrick,” he said — and added “we’re going to come out of this with guys we need,” even though the Steelers have only six picks as of now in the draft. The Steelers do not pick until 49th overall and have only two selections among the top 102.</p>
<p>Drafting an offensive skill player is the Steelers’ strongest desire, especially coming off a season in which they scored just 10 touchdowns in the final 10 games and were the only team to never score at least 30 points in any game.</p>
<p>But when asked if offense is the team’s top priority in the draft, Tomlin said, “We have some position needs, but, as we always do, we’ll let the development (of the draft board) do our work for us. There are a lot of good players on both sides of the ball that we can utilize.”</p>
<p>Colbert, though, said some of the offensive problems in the second half of the season should be eased by the return of Ben Roethlisberger, who is targeting a return for the regular-season opener, whenever that might be.</p>
<p>“We’re going on the assumption we’ll have Ben Roethlisberger available,” Colbert said. “When you have that caliber of a quarterback back, everyone’s play picks up. We’ll factor that into all the thinking we do in this draft.”</p>
<p>Colbert, though, acknowledged that the talent and depth at wide receiver is the strongest position in the draft.</p>
<p>“We do feel good about that group,” he said. “It’s a deep group. There are some dynamic players; some slot types, some big outside guys. We probably feel as good about that position as we do any other.”</p>
<p>Several national mocks drafts, including Mel Kiper Jr.’s most recent one, have the Steelers selecting Oklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts with their top pick. When asked about that, Colbert said:</p>
<p>“We look at every position, no different than any other given year, whether we pick 1, 32 or not picking. We evaluate the whole board. We have a good feel for those guys. But you feel good about Number 7 coming back, we know what we have in Mason (Rudolph). We’ll see where we go.”</p>
