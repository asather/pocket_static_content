<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>New cases of COVID-19 in Allegheny County remained in triple digits with the county reporting Saturday that another 146 people were infected per results of 1,631 tests performed from July 7 through Friday.</p>

<p>The daily report showed one additional death — a 93-year-old on July 17 — bringing the county total to 222 deaths. Hospitalizations climbed to 577 with four new cases. Since March 14, there have been 7,161 cases of COVID-19 in the county.</p>
<p>Statewide, the Pennsylvania Health Department reported Saturday there&nbsp;are 1,054 additional positive cases of COVID-19, bringing the statewide total to 106,625. All 67 counties in Pennsylvania have cases of COVID-19. Saturday marked&nbsp;the third time this week — and the fifth time this month — that Pennsylvania has reported a single-day total of more than 1,000 new cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In addition to Allegheny County, other counties reporting increases of more than 100 cases include Philadelphia County with 177 new cases and&nbsp;Delaware County with a hike of 110 cases.</p>
<p>There are 7,114 total deaths attributed to COVID-19, an increase of 13 new reported deaths, according to the state health department.</p>
<p>The state said the number of tests administered between July 18 and 24 was 157,974 with 6,384 positive cases. There were 24,891 test results reported to the state health department through 10 p.m. Friday, representing the total number of tests administered.</p>
<p>“As the state has put in place new mitigation efforts to offset recent case increases, we must renew our commitment to protecting against COVID-19 by wearing a mask, practicing social distancing and following the requirements set forth in the orders for bars and restaurants, gatherings and telework,” Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said in a press release. “Pennsylvania has been a model for the country on how to reopen effectively using a careful, measured approach. However, we know the virus has not gone away as we see cases rise, so we must work together to stop another surge.”</p>
<p>The release noted the department has seen “significant increases’ in the number of COVID-19 cases among younger age groups, particularly 19- to 24-year-olds. Leading the list was the state’s southwestern region — Allegheny, Armstrong, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Somerset, Washington and Westmoreland counties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“An alert was sent to healthcare providers about the changing COVID-19 case demographics, as there are more cases in younger age groups than in those 50-64 and 65+.”</p>
<p>The following regions have seen significant increases among 19 to 24-year-olds in each month from April to present in July:</p>
<p>SW – Approximately 5 percent of cases in April to approximately 20 percent of cases so far in July;</p>
<p>SE – Nearly 5 percent of cases in April to approximately 19 percent of cases so far in July;</p>
<p>NE – 6 percent of cases in April to more than 16 percent of cases so far in July;</p>
<p>SC – Approximately 7 percent of cases in April to 14 percent of cases so far in July.</p>
<p>NW – Nearly 7 percent of cases in April to more than 13 percent of cases so far in July; and</p>
