<h1>Gene Collier: A precaution that threatens the writing process</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Look, I don’t want to be difficult about this, but I can’t not touch my face.</p>
<p>That’s impossible.</p>
<p>It’s pretty much all I do. I write columns and I touch my face, often simultaneously. Columns from me are 10% typing, 90% staring at the screen for hours, most of it head in hands.</p>
<p>The basic pose, with variations, is elbows on desk, left hand covering right fist, chin on top of both, or supported by left thumb, eyes staring at (mostly blank) screen. I also do elbows on desk, left fist pressed into left cheekbone, right into right. Also there’s the one with the thumbs mounted on the cheekbones and all eight fingers forming a trans-forehead bridge if not actually massaging the forehead. Toggling among all of these, there’s plenty of eye swiping and nose rubbing. On particularly difficult pieces, I’ll let my hands slide up to scratch my head or possibly pull my hair out.</p>
<p>That’s “the writing process.”</p>
<p>The good news is I’m totally down with the hand-washing thing, even if I’ve been hearing for about a week now that I don’t know how to do it. If there’s one thing we’ve concluded definitively from the COVID-19 outbreak, it’s that there’s an urgent need for hand-washing instruction nationwide, apparently because Americans do not know how to wash their hands, among many, many other things.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing it wrong for 60-some years.</p>
<p>Last week I got an email with the subject line “Are you washing your face correctly?” Turned out I was. What a relief.</p>
<p>But the hands, well, I was not aware of the 20-seconds thing. This is apparently Gospel. Twenty seconds is the minimum you should commit to this task, a position shared by every source I’ve seen, meaning that, yes, it has transcended politics.</p>
<p>Fox News contributor Donna Brazile tweeted out a 12-panel illustration about hand-washing that looked like a page from my owner’s manual on how to work the car’s sound system, which I can’t. NBC did a story featuring Lawrence Jackson in which he suggested you sing “Happy Birthday” twice while you’re washing your hands to ensure you’ve done it for 20 seconds. I guess that’s fine, but if standing in an empty room in front of a mirror singing “Happy Birthday” to nobody creeps you out even a little bit, a deliberate tempo affixed to the first verse of John Prine’s “Dear Abby,” works just as well.</p>
<p>To refresh:</p>
<p><em>Dear Abby, Dear Abby</em></p>
<p><em>My feet are too long</em></p>
<p><em>My hair’s falling out and my rights are all wrongs</em></p>
<p><em>My friends they all tell me I’ve no friends at all</em></p>
<p><em>Won’t you write me a letter, won’t ya give me a call?</em></p>
<p><em>Signed, Bewildered.</em></p>
<p>You’re welcome.</p>
<p>Dr. Oz himself visited the set of Good Morning America and washed his hands for 49.52 seconds, emphasizing the fingertips and the thumbs, invoking the term “Turkish twist,” (I don’t know), then even suggested what you should be thinking about during your minimum of 20 seconds, but only after implying that the 20 seconds don’t start until you’ve lathered up. I haven’t seen a CDC ruling on that contention.</p>
<p>“Don’t think about just being calm,” he said. “Think about how we’re a can-do nation and we can stay ahead of this.”</p>
<p>If we can’t, it’s not going to result from a lack of information out there about hand-washing, which itself has gone viral (you’ll excuse the expression) on the Internet, where readily available topics include myths about and common mistakes about hand-washing.</p>
<p>Mistakes are one thing, but mythology? What, like the pinky sets out on a dangerous quest to please the Ring Finger God, but this greatly displeases the wrathful thumb? The pointer finger floods the battlefield with soap before joining the fray? Is it like that?</p>
<p>These, I imagine, are among The Common Mistakes of Hand-Washing.</p>
<p>Washing only one hand.</p>
<p>Washing fewer than 10 fingers.</p>
<p>Failing to determine in advance that the faucet is working and having to wipe your soapy hands on the dog.</p>
<p>These I imagine are among the Uncommon Mistakes of Hand-Washing.</p>
<p>Falling headfirst into the mirror and slicing open your upper lip.</p>
<p>Having the bar of soap pop free and slide across the counter into the toilet.</p>
<p>Uncommon mistakes, to be sure, but hey, be careful in there.</p>
<p>When the virus runs its course, we’ll look back on this and marvel at all the dubious precautions that were developed. The sports leagues are really struggling with this. The National Hockey League is considering closing locker rooms to the media, never mind that there are 20,000 people in the building who are not credentialed. The National Basketball Association has discouraged its players from high-fiving fans, never mind that the players have slammed their sweat-soaked bodies into each other for 48 minutes every night.</p>
<p>But we’ll figure it out.</p>
<p>Just remember, one hand washes the other, and both hands wash the . . . DON’T TOUCH YOUR FACE!</p>
<p>Sorry. I have to.</p>
