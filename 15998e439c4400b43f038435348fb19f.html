<h1>Mandy Moore on her comeback: 'This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for me'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rebecca Pearson is doing a singing gig in a Pittsburgh bar when she meets her future husband, Jack, in the hit series “This Is Us.”</p>
<p>In a case of life nearly imitating art, Mandy Moore, who plays Rebecca, planned to open her comeback tour here in Pittsburgh Friday with a band led by&nbsp;real-life husband, Taylor Goldsmith, of Dawes.</p>
<p>That tour, of course is postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, but “Silver Landings,” her first album in 11 years, is out now for everyone to hear.</p>
<p>It continues a career that began when the New Hampshire native, at 15, was signed in the teen-pop heyday of the late ’90s and started charting hits with “Candy” and “I Want to Be With You.” As a contemporary of Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, in 1999 she toured with both big boy bands — ’N Sync and the Backstreet Boys.</p>
<p>But she had her sights set on something bigger. In 2001, she made her screen debut in the comedy “The Princess Diaries,” and followed that in 2002 with the romantic drama “A Walk to Remember,” based on the Nicholas Sparks novel.</p>
<p>With 2007’s album “Wild Hope,” Moore shifted her musical career from bubblegum pop to a more sophisticated singer-songwriter style that drew comparisons to the likes of Sarah McLachlan and Fiona Apple, and she stayed on that course with 2009’s “Amanda Leigh.”</p>

<p>Of the many film and TV roles that followed, among the biggest was voicing Rapunzel is the 2010 Disney hit “Tangled,” which also earned her an Oscar and a Grammy for the song “I See the Light.”</p>
<p>Her album career, though, hit a roadblock during her relationship with volatile alt-country star Ryan Adams, whom she first met when she was 23. They married in 2010 and planned to work together on her seventh album. That project never materialized and they parted ways in 2015, with her later telling The New York Times that the #MeToo-ed musician was “psychologically abusive.”</p>
<p>It was after that marriage dissolved that she was cast in NBC’s “This Is Us,” launching in September 2016. Obviously, that’s kept Moore busy, but now her relationship with Goldsmith, whom she married in November 2018, has led to this first album in more than a decade.</p>
<p>“Silver Landings” — which was written and performed with Goldsmith and members of Dawes and produced by her longtime collaborator Mike Viola —&nbsp;is a polished “California pop” record, inspired by Fleetwood Mac, Joni Mitchell, etc.. It finds her reflecting on her life and career in such songs as “Fifteen” (about her teen-pop days) and “Save a Little for Yourself” and “Forgiveness,” clearly about her relationship with Adams.</p>
<p>This is what Moore had to say in a recent phone interview.</p>
<p><strong>So, I get the sense that Taylor must be a great working partner. Can you tell me how you met?</strong></p>
<p>We met because of Instagram. I heard those [Dawes] songs on the radio in LA. I didn’t know who they were and I put it on my Instagram, like “This band is amazing. This song is going to be the soundtrack of my summer.” I didn’t tag them, I wasn’t looking to make new friends or anything. And he saw it and wrote me a very sweet, innocuous, gentlemanly email and figured out a way to get it sent to me through his manager and my manager. So, because of that, we started corresponding and then we went out to dinner, and that was five years ago. And now we’re husband and wife, so, Instagram — not even sliding into the DMs, like the kids do — just because of Instagram existing as a platform is how I met him.</p>
<p><strong>At what point did you start to talk about making music together?</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much from the start of our relationship we talked about it, and it took a while to get there because it they’re busy, they’re on the road, they’re touring, we’re just newly into our relationship. And then six months later, I got “This is Us,” and it’s kind of been the last four years of my life.</p>
<p>But over the course of the last few years, even living with someone who is as prolific as Taylor, music is a constant throughline in our house. He’s always playing, we’re always playing records. Music is alive and well here, so it just was a no-brainer to think, “Oh, eventually if I was to make music again, I would be making it with him and no one else.” I can’t imagine having collaborated with anyone.</p>
<p>Mike and Taylor are two of the closest people in my life and they’re two of my favorite artists and songwriters. I have this incredible community of friends and musicians here in Los Angeles and I knew that making music again, and specifically making a pop record, I wanted to make it on my own terms of what pop sort of means to me. So being able to rely on the people I love made me feel very safe to wade back into the musical waters.</p>
<p><strong>How did you go about finding the sound you wanted, the musical approach?</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to make a pop record, and pop to me just feels live and organic. I wanted it to feel like sunny Southern California in the 1970s without leaning into being too retro. I wanted to make a record like they used to make records, so we recorded the album live to tape so it has that warm, heavy, kind of fat sound to it.</p>
<p>And I’d never made a record like that before, where we got three takes and then we’re gonna go into the control room and listen and if anyone f-ed it up we’re gonna go cut it again. It was so much fun. It keeps you on your toes, but I also felt like I was able to really sort of lead the band in a way I never had before. I never felt like I was ever part of a band.</p>
<p>I made my last record with Mike and he played everything, but my vocal was the last thing added to the track, so I was just singing on top of it, which didn’t really allow for a ton of freedom or maneuvering. I loved making a record specifically this way. It was like “Ahh, making music again is a conduit for getting back on the road,” and so cutting a record live like this, it just feels like, “Oh, this is what it’s going to feel like playing a show every night, to be on stage with these guys.”</p>
<p><strong>I talk to a lot of artists who will say, “Oh, I’m just writing characters.” But this sounds like you, like a very personal album. Is that right?</strong></p>
<p>It is. I wouldn’t know how to write characters at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Even though you play one …</strong></p>
<p>Right, for sure. I felt like me, as Mandy. I’ve lived a tremendous wealth of life in the last decade since I’ve made an album and I had plenty that I wanted to say, so it was like, “Let me get this out of my system first and then, you know, I can think about writing from someone else’s perspective.”</p>
<p><strong>“Fifteen” is fascinating. You sing, “She thought she was making music, but she was only filling seats.” Is that how you look back on your teen-pop days?</strong></p>
<p>I think, specifically, playing shows, for sure. People say, “Oh, you’re touring again, how exciting is this?” I’m like, “Well, technically, I’ve only toured once.” That was in 2007 for a record called “Wild Hope.”</p>
<p>Beyond that, as a kid, as a teen in the height of all of that stuff, we’d play radio shows, we’d open for the Backstreet Boys and ’N Sync, but you know, an opening act, especially then, it was like six songs or something. It wasn’t like I had a full show that I ever really truly played.</p>
<p>So in this sense, touring is going to be like a completely new endeavor. So, I do think back to those times, that specific time in my life, and in many ways it was just about filling seats. It wasn’t about anything substantive, which, I guess, it didn't need to be. It shouldn't have been. I was a 15-year-old singing about missing something like candy, which doesn't really make too much sense. So it was perfect for what it was. And I have a lot of affection for myself and for that time, in retrospect, because she was the reason I’m here today but, also, I think I handled myself pretty well.</p>
<p>I’ve been in this business now for 20 years and I came out of that time of my life relatively unscathed and as a functioning adult. I think I need to give myself more credit than I did when I was younger because I didn’t make these choices — I just went into the studio and sang whatever they wanted me to sing. So having the creative control now, it feels like night and day.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that would have been harder now, with social media, to come out unscathed?</strong></p>
<p>I think everything would be harder now. I am so glad I didn’t have to grow up with social media, mugging for Instagram and all this that kids have to deal with nowadays. We’re on set the other day and some of my “kids” were like, “Are you on Tik Tok, Mandy?” I was like “Tik Tok? No, no. THAT is for you. That is not for me.” Like, I can’t possibly have to learn about a whole other platform. I am full to the brim, thank you so much. I’m glad I don’t have to worry about that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>You do have a line about regrets in that song. Do you wish you had waited to be a more mature artist to launch your career?</strong></p>
<p>No way! I am so fortunate that, through luck and happenstance, I managed to find a record deal at 14, 15 years old. Here I am, 20 years later, still doing what I love, in the best chapter of my life, thus far. I think the regrets, truly, are a little more of a wink at the sillier, more surface stuff like some of my fashion choices.</p>
<p>The more substantive, true life-altering things — I’m not someone who lives with regrets. I am a big believer in things happening for a reason and a glass-half-full person, so I think the regrets are a little more of a silly thought than anything.</p>
<p><strong>“Forgiveness” is a powerful song in the middle of this record. You’re revisiting that painful part of your past. Did you feel like you needed to address that?</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to write that song because, ultimately, I think it’s about taking ownership for my side of the street and forgiving myself and not carrying around the baggage of regret or guilt or shame. So, yeah, I feel like I needed to write that song in that it addressed the past, but I think there were songs that delved more pointedly and deeper in the past that were written for this record and didn’t end up getting recorded because clearly I needed the catharsis of writing them but I have no interest in singing about that stuff every night.</p>
<p>There was a big mandate for me in what ended up making the album. Again, if this record is a conduit to getting back on the road, what do I want to sing every night? And I don’t want to have to relive miserable moments in front of an audience night after night. I have the creative control and freedom to make those choices. I’m not gonna go down that road if I don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel putting this out in the world?</strong></p>
<p>I am excited. I am thrilled. I can’t wait. I’m excited to hit the road and have this experience of making music every night with the people that I love the most. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for me and I’ve been dreaming about it.</p>
<p>I’ve had this dream of being on the road, kind of on a pedestal, for so long, so the chance to live this out, have my music out in the world, it feels like I am back in touch with a side of myself that has been dormant for too long —&nbsp;so to be nurturing that side of myself again, feels so fulfilling. I don’t mean to sound Pollyannaish or cheesy. I feel like this fully realized version of myself now.</p>
<p><strong>How will you work in older material on the tour?</strong></p>
<p>I think that’s something I’m really excited about, because of this band. I will play anything with this band. Honestly, we’re just getting into the rehearsal process for the tour and we’re figuring out what arrangements are going to be, but I have no doubt we’ll figure that out and we’ll have plenty of older material.</p>
<p>A lot of stuff from “Wild Hope,” a couple things from “So Real.” I was like we should try “I Wanna Be With You.” I don't know if I could sing a song like “Crush.” It feels weird to be singing about a crush at 35, but maybe we’ll figure that out too. Some of the material feels weird to be a full-blown adult to be singing about, but I think we’ll make it work.</p>
