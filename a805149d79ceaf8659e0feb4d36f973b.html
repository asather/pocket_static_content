<h1>Legislation would require state to inspect nursing homes for COVID-19, report findings</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Citing the state’s largest COVID-19 nursing home outbreak at a Beaver County nursing home, a state representative Monday proposed legislation to require the Pennsylvania Department of Health to inspect all of the commonwealth’s nursing homes and report to the public how many COVID-19 cases each of them has.</p>
<p>In addition, state Rep. Rob Matzie, D-Ambridge, also sent a letter Monday to state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, asking his office to investigate the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center after a federal class action lawsuit filed last week claimed that the Department of Health failed to oversee what the lawsuit calls improper “biomedical experimentation” of residents there during the outbreak.</p>
<p>Mr. Matzie, whose district does not include Brighton Rehabilitation but does include residents’ families in eastern Beaver County, said what has happened over the last five weeks at Brighton Rehabilitation made him want to find out more about how nursing homes and personal care homes are handling the COVID-19 pandemic, but he knows that the problem is statewide.</p>
<p>“There are outbreaks in long-term care facilities all over the state,” he said, noting Republicans in the Senate have proposed a similar provision to inspect and report on nursing homes. “We need to know more.”</p>
<p>The state has so far refused to provide details about the number of positive COVID-19 cases or deaths at any individual nursing homes, citing a decades-old law that lets them choose whether to release the information or not.</p>
<p>But data that the state began posting daily last month by county of the number of nursing homes and personal care homes that have at least one positive case <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/28/Disturbing-events-at-Beaver-County-nursing-home-as-COVID-19-deaths-rise-to-52/stories/202004280137" target="_blank">has allowed the Post-Gazette to determine that Brighton Rehabilitation</a> now has 61 COVID-19-related deaths — nine more than last week — and 297 positive cases there among residents, and 22 cases among staff.</p>
<p>The nursing home, the fourth largest in the state with a maximum 589 beds, had about 460 residents when the first positive COVID-19 case was detected there at the end of March.</p>
<p>“I got my first call about Brighton on Friday, March 27, and then county commissioners were asking what we have to do to get the state to issue a stay-at-home order for Beaver County because they quickly had double-digit cases and two deaths” at the nursing home, Mr. Matzie said, after proposing the legislation. “There was transparency with the nursing home for about a week after that. But in early April, that stopped.”</p>
<p>“We need to know what is going on there,” he said.</p>
<p>The state stopped all routine inspections of nursing homes on March 6, as a way to prevent further spread of the virus with state inspectors coming and going into the home.</p>
<p>“However, any surveys in relation to complaints and reported incidents at the immediate jeopardy level, infection control surveys and initial surveys are allowed and still expected to be conducted,” said state Department of Health spokesman Nate Wardle on Monday in an emailed answer to questions.</p>
<p>Mr. Matzie’s legislation would require an inspection of each facility’s infection control procedures, provide testing for every resident and employee, provide personnel and resources to each facility to deal with any outbreak, and report all findings back to the public.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardle said the state could not comment on proposed legislation.</p>
<p>Bob Daley, an attorney for Jodi Gill, the plaintiff in the federal lawsuit filed against the Department of Health last week, said the legislation Mr. Matzie proposed “echoes what we’re seeking in our lawsuit.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit is not seeking monetary damages. Instead, it is seeking an injunction that would require the state to inspect Brighton Rehabilitation over the claims made in the lawsuit and report to the public what it finds.</p>
<p>Ms. Gill, whose father, Glenn, 81, is still a resident at Brighton Rehabilitation and who filed the class action lawsuit last week, said she was “ecstatic” about Mr. Matzie’s legislation proposal.</p>
<p>She also was happy that Mr. Matzie sent a letter to Mr. Shapiro asking for an investigation into what the lawsuit alleges was improper experimentation on her father as the nursing home tried to prevent him from getting COVID-19 through the use of doses of hydroxychloroquine and zinc.</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine is the drug approved to help people with malaria that was, for a time, touted by President Donald Trump, at least until <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v1.full.pdf" target="_blank">a Veterans Affairs study found it did not benefit patients</a> and might have actually damaged other organs.</p>
<p>Citing Ms. Gill’s lawsuit, Mr. Matzie said in his letter to Mr. Shapiro, in part: “I have, for over a month, voiced my concerns to the PA Department of Health but people continue to die and become infected at alarmingly high rates. I’m asking you, as the Chief Law Enforcement Officer in our Commonwealth, to ensure this facility is adhering to all statutory requirements in light of the serious allegations of questionable experimental treatment on residents.”</p>
<p>Though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2020/03/30/fda-approves-anti-malarial-drugs-chloroquine-and-hydroxychloroquine-for-emergency-coronavirus-treatment/#42e73a185e5d" target="_blank">initially authorized experimental use of hydroxychloroquine</a>, only then to i<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or" target="_blank">ssue a caution against its use after the VA study</a>, Ms. Gill said her issue — as detailed in her lawsuit — was the way Brighton Rehabilitation pushed family members like her to sign consent forms.</p>
<p>“I’m a lawyer and I’m familiar with [institutional review boards that typically approve experiments] and I felt trapped” by Brighton’s language about needing to do everything she could to help her father, she said. “And I’m sure others who didn’t understand that situation as well as I did felt trapped, too.”</p>
<p>She said she agreed to allow the treatment on April 10 via email under duress, and her father — who has not tested positive for COVID-19 —&nbsp;apparently went through five days of treatment. But she said the nursing home has never told her if the drug had any impact on her father one way or the other.</p>
<p>“I’ve not heard a word about it since,” she said.</p>
