<h1>Letters from Pirates camp: Two errors and one realization</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — It would either be the golf cart or the pole. At one point Wednesday morning, I so badly wanted to pick one of them to punch, the result of my two errors turning a two-run lead into a tie game.</p>
<p>They weren’t hard plays. I’m pretty sure Jack Wilson could have made them with a napkin dispenser. But given the situation our team was in at the time, they absolutely had to be made. They weren’t. I biffed them. Bad.</p>
<p>What transpired in the moments that followed, and throughout the rest of the game, was fascinating, which is why I decided to write about it.</p>
<p>Earlier in my life, there’s a good chance I would have punched the golf cart or the pole. I might’ve thrown my glove. Keeping my cool was something I always had to work hard to have happen, though I wasn’t going to be that guy at Pirates Fantasy Camp.</p>
<p>Still, the fact that I was so steamed got me thinking.</p>
<p>Before this thing, I did basically no prep work. Didn’t have time with the Pirates offseason. If I ever do this again, I’m definitely going to find the guys who work out a couple nights a week in Wexford and throw, catch and hit before coming down here.</p>
<p>Why I was so mad, though, speaks to what happens at this camp. I wasn’t mad because I played a couple of ground balls off my glove at second base. Without any reasonable preparation, what sort of expectations should I have had?</p>
<p>I was mad because I let my teammates down, guys I’ve really grown to like.</p>
<p>Because of my poor fielding, we could have potentially missed the playoffs, though thankfully Wardo Brigham, our leadoff hitter/pitcher/infielder, came through with a huge, two-out double in the top of the seventh inning and Doug Frame, throwing about 47 mph, closed it out with a clean seventh.</p>
<p>The victory ensured we would play in the semifinals on Thursday morning. It made me feel less bad about fielding like I had frying pans taped to my hands, and it taught me something.</p>
<p>The allure of fantasy camp, at least I thought, was to live like a major leaguer for a week, to eat the food the Pirates eat, to play on their fields, to wear their uniform, to use their training room, to live where they live.</p>
<p>That’s obviously part of it, but it’s not all of it. A bigger selling point, in my opinion, is the friendships you form. Already I’m thinking about everyone going their separate ways on Saturday morning, many to other states, and that stinks. I’ll miss so many people I’ve met here. They’re awesome. I wish my wife and kids could meet them.</p>
<p>One example: When I was steamed, our center fielder, Bob Shaffer, was able to calm me down. I think he said something about needing to forget about it, we’re still going to get a chance, whatever. I’m not sure really sure. But I know I appreciated it.</p>
<p>This week I’ve learned that Bob looks way younger than his age (61), retired early because he and his wife wanted to ensure someone was home with their 9-year-old daughter, and he spent his career in computer software, helping companies implement and upgrade Oracle.</p>
<p>Bob, like other campers, came here once, was blown away by the friendships that were formed and simply couldn’t fathom missing another year. His wife, who nudged him the first time, practically pushed him back to Florida.</p>
<p>“I just love baseball,” said Shaffer, who lives in Kennedy Township. “It’s fun to play. It’s a great group of guys and girls down here. The first year people were so welcoming. I just had to do it again.”</p>
<p>I know how you feel, Bob. Even after making a couple of costly, boneheaded errors.</p>
<p><strong>Catching on</strong></p>
<p>Our second game Wednesday was meaningless. We’re locked into our playoff seed and can’t move either way. So we decided to take the opportunity to do a couple different things.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing second base, shortstop, third base and even one inning in the outfield, in addition to pitching, but for this game, I asked if I could catch.</p>
<p>Catching has always been my favorite position to play, even more so than pitcher. I love having the entire game in front of you and how you’re involved with every pitch. The strategy involved is awesome. Ditto for reading hitters’ swings and formulating a game plan for guys around that.</p>
<p>I tried a couple times to convince my coach at Westminster, Carmen Nocera, to let me catch, though he never relented — not until the final series of my senior year. Filled with excitement over my chance to get a couple games behind the plate, I wound up going 4 for 10 with a home run and a couple of runners thrown out at second base.</p>
<p>Wednesday wasn’t nearly as exciting, but it did feel good to move around behind the plate again, to block a few balls, to frame some pitches, to nail a runner at first on a dribbler in front of home plate.</p>
<p>I pitched the first inning of the game, although I’ve been dealing with stupid arm problems. Dru Scott, who’s the head athletic trainer for Triple-A Indianapolis, again worked on my right arm — and he could have taken me to the ground in tears if he pressed any harder on my pronator tendon.</p>
<p>As Scott explained, the pronator helps your forearm flex and rotate so your palm faces down when you throw. “You know literally everything you need to throw a baseball?” Scott said. “It’s that.”</p>
<p>So, great. That body part hurts, as does my rotator cuff. I have a blister on the inside of my right big toe and tightness in my legs, but other than that, I’m holding up OK. The arm problems, though, are the biggest bummer. I just want to get through the final few days healthy and maybe pitch some Thursday.</p>
