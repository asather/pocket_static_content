<h1>Holland, Brault make initial pitches for fifth starter spot</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — They’re left-handed and two of the more easygoing personalities in the Pirates clubhouse. They’re also very likely competing for the same spot — to become the team’s fifth starter.</p>
<p>Although it’s extremely early, with several more rounds ahead and Chad Kuhl still waiting to have his say, Sunday’s game against the Tigers at LECOM Park — an eventual 8-4 Pirates loss — offered an intriguing look at both Derek Holland and Steven Brault.</p>
<p>Holland worked around a leadoff home run and a poorly executed pitch the next inning, but he wound up striking out five over 1 2/3 innings. Brault, meanwhile, made quick work of Detroit’s lineup in the third inning, going 1-2-3 on just eight pitches.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of funny to say I got all the outs,” Holland said. “I wanted these guys to get some of the outs for me.”</p>
<p>Holland wound up throwing 34 pitches, 19 for strikes. Tigers center fielder JaCoby Jones led off the game with a homer to right, connecting with a fastball up and away from Holland. The Pirates pitcher was OK with that one, but he didn’t like the 83 mph changeup he threw to Tigers catcher Grayson Greiner an inning later, resulting in a second run.</p>
<p>“When we’re out there working, you don’t want to get lazy with anything,” Holland said. “I definitely got lazy with that pitch.”</p>
<p>Brault dealt with a shoulder injury last year and said he’s trying to build his arm up slower than he has in the past, hence why his afternoon was cut short.</p>
<p>Despite the limited work, Brault was able to use a couple different pitches, not relying solely on his fastball like he did at times last season.</p>
<p>“Some of spring training is working on stuff, getting pitches in,” Brault said. “I felt good about pretty much every pitch I threw [Sunday]. I only really missed once.”</p>
<p>The Holland element of this equation is probably the most intriguing because we know what Brault can do; during the middle of last season, he was the Pirates’ best starter, pitching a 3.24 ERA from May 29-Sept. 7.</p>
<p>If the Pirates are able to get the former version of Holland, the guy who had a 3.57 ERA for the Giants in 2018, perhaps they could insert him into the rotation, bump Brault to the bullpen and potentially flip Holland for prospects at the deadline, turning a cheap contract into future pieces.</p>
<p>But again, Sunday was one game. A shortened version at that. Holland still has plenty yet to prove and made a couple of mistakes, while Brault’s sample size was extremely small.</p>
<p>“This was a little bit of a slower approach this year for me,” Brault said. “It feels good. It’ll be an actual build throughout the spring, instead of trying to maintain. I feel good about that.”</p>
<p>As for Holland, pay attention to his changeup. His fastball had life and topped out at 91 mph. Holland also has a terrific slider. But he failed to finish his changeup, and the Tigers made him pay.</p>
<p><strong>Riddle rules</strong></p>
<p>JT Riddle has neither played second base nor batted leadoff much throughout his career, though he did both pretty well on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Jan. 31 acquisition opened the game by drawing an 11-pitch walk, then took an extra base when the Tigers were in a shift, and nobody covered third. That enabled Riddle to score with one out on Will Craig’s sacrifice fly.</p>
<p>After a bit of a cue shot that scored a run in the second, Riddle laced a triple to right in the fourth, again taking another base with a heads-up play while running.</p>
<p>“One thing I’ve always tried to work hard on is baserunning,” Riddle said. “Teams can win a lot of games because of baserunning.”</p>
<p>They can also win by taking pitches, wearing down starters and getting into the other team’s bullpen. Riddle did that extremely well on Sunday, which caught Pirates manager Derek Shelton’s attention.</p>
<p>“We see right there the kind of hitter he can be,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on Riddle. There’s a good chance he makes the team as a utility guy; his hands have been impressive to watch thus far in infield drills, and he can also play some outfield.</p>
<p>If he can hit, see pitches and runs the bases well, he’ll likely cement a spot on the roster.</p>
<p><strong>Kela electric</strong></p>
<p>Keone Kela had a funny exchange with home-plate umpire Laz Diaz during his fourth-inning outing: After striking out the first batter he faced on three pitches, Kela broke off a nasty curveball to Jorge Bonifacio that should’ve been strike three.</p>
<p>Diaz admitted to Kela that he missed it.</p>
<p>“He asked me where I got that curveball,” Kela said. “I said, ‘C’mon, Laz. I’ve had this for the last five years.’ He was like, ‘Man, that thing is nasty.’ I know if the umpire is having issues seeing it, the hitters are as well. Laz told me he’ll get me this season.”</p>
<p>Kela was laughing during the exchange, but he wasn’t laughing when he threw a couple first-pitch curveballs for strikes.</p>
<p>“I know in spring guys are trying to get their work in, as am I,” Kela said. “But I’m not going to give anybody some free juice, let ‘em pop me and hit it 450 feet.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’ve always been able to locate my curveball and throw it for putaway as well. I just wanted to see what that dynamic [of throwing it first pitch] looked like.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Enjoy everything’</strong></p>
<p>Holland would be the Pirates’ longest-tenured player if he makes the roster. He also might qualify as the Pirates’ most entertaining.</p>
<p>Already this spring we’ve seen him wear a straw hat for warmups, make a hilarious and late entrance to a charity event and joke around plenty with his teammates.</p>
<p>That’s by design, as Holland wants to be himself and also help the Pirates loosen up a little bit.</p>
<p>“We want to keep things loose in this clubhouse,” Holland said. “I know what’s happened in the past. I’ve heard about it. We’re not going to let that kind of stuff happen. We’ve got a good group of guys and a good, strong staff that’s going to keep these guys focused. I think that’s what it really comes down to. We need to enjoy everything.”</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>• Gregory Polanco went 0-for-2 with a walk in his first spring training game, although Shelton liked what he saw from the right fielder.</p>
<p>“The aggression of his swings was something that stood out to me,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>• Oneil Cruz was fun to watch. Crushed a ball the opposite way, off the wall in left for a run-scoring double. Then he made a smart read on the squibbed that Riddle hit and scored a run.</p>
<p>• Shelton on the Pirates traveling to Tampa to face Gerrit Cole on Monday: “Any time we can get in any bit of a rowdy atmosphere early on, that’s great. It’s good for our guys.”</p>
