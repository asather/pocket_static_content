<h1>Trump lawyers argue president can seek help for re-election, ahead of crucial vote on witnesses</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The motivations behind President Donald Trump’s demand that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son took center stage on Wednesday during nine hours of questioning by U.S. senators as <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/01/29/President-Donald-Trump-impeachment-trial-senators-questioning-John-Roberts/stories/202001290078" target="_blank">Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial</a> entered a crucial phase.</p>
<p>And at least three moderate Republicans — key to passing any measure to call witnesses — appeared to be conflicted about whether Mr. Trump was driven only by personal political gain, as House Democrats have asserted, or the public interest, as White House lawyers have argued.</p>
<p>Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. — speaking on behalf Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah — rose to ask the first question of the day: How should the senators assess Mr. Trump’s possibly competing motivations?</p>
<p>Part of the answer came a short time later, when Alan Dershowitz, an attorney for Mr. Trump, argued a public official could not be impeached for asking for a favor to get re-elected.</p>
<p>“Every public official that I know believes his election is in the public interest,” Mr. Dershowitz said. “If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.”</p>
<p>Patrick Philbin, another attorney for Mr. Trump, answered Ms. Collins that if the president felt a “smidgeon” of public interest in his dealings with Ukraine, he cannot be impeached, even if he were also motivated by personal political gain.</p>
<p>Those responses, which were roundly criticized by Democrats, could contain logic used by Senate Republicans as the trial nears a vote, expected on Friday, on whether to call witnesses. The question of mixed motivations also arose in Mr. Romney’s list of questions, which he posted to Twitter.</p>
<p>The question-and-answer session provided some insight into how senators have processed roughly 36 hours of arguments over six days. Senators asked roughly 100 questions, all written on off-white note cards and carried to Chief Justice John Roberts to be read aloud.</p>
<p>Many of the questions were pointed, with each party leading its side to restate or sharpen arguments that were already presented on the Senate floor over the last week.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans directed most of their questions to White House counsel, while Senate Democrats stuck to inquiries for the House Democrats. Answers were kept to five minutes, with Mr. Roberts, who has been presiding over the trial, occasionally cutting off the speaker with a gentle “thank you.”</p>
<p>“It’s highly unlikely that you’ll see either side asking questions of the other side,” Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., told reporters during an afternoon break in the trial. “The truth of the matter is, you don’t want to give someone an opportunity just to drone on forever without actually answering the question.”</p>
<p>But it also led to some answers that were unconvincing to both sides. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said he heard “nothing new or revelatory” during the questioning period that would change his mind on voting to acquit Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>The most closely watched questions were submitted by the small group of moderate Republican senators, including Ms. Collins, who are at the center of a political tug-of-war over witnesses.</p>
<p>House Democrats seized on Ms. Collins’ wondering about Mr. Trump’s motivations to press the Senate to call John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, as a witness.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolton’s upcoming book, entitled “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” reportedly details direct conversations with Mr. Trump, according to a report in The New York Times on Sunday.</p>
<p>If senators have any question if Mr. Trump had a public interest motive, “there is a witness a subpoena away who can answer that question,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.</p>
<p>“Don’t wait for the book,” Mr. Schiff said. “You can erase all doubt.”</p>
<p>Ms. Collins has said she is “very likely” to call witnesses, while Mr. Romney has said Mr. Bolton's book "strengthens the case" for witnesses.</p>
<p>Few other senators who are considered to be on the fence have shared their thoughts — but some conveyed their thinking on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At about 9 p.m., Ms. Murkowski, the moderate Republican from Alaska, rose to ask why the House managers had not attempted to resolve legal disputes with the White House over their subpoenas before sending the articles to the Senate.</p>
<p>Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, responded Mr. Trump “invented the theory” that the House needed to vote to “authorize” an impeachment inquiry before subpoenas were legally enforceable.</p>
<p>Further, Ms. Garcia said, the Constitution vests the House of Representatives with the “sole power of impeachment” and contains “no requirements for how the House must carry out that responsibility.”</p>
<p>Mr. Philbin, the White House lawyer, told Ms. Murkowski the House has “affirmatively avoided getting any litigation” done because "they had a timetable. … They had no time for the courts.”</p>
<p>The debate over witnesses raged on Wednesday, and the two sides sparred over how much longer the trial could last with compelled testimony.</p>
<p>The White House portrayed witnesses as paralyzing the Senate’s business for “months,” in the estimation of Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters that “we could get the whole thing done in a week.”</p>
<p>Mr. Schumer said “at least some” Republican senators were still weighing whether to join the 47 Democrats and Independents in approving such a measure.</p>
<p>But he was not holding his breath. “Is it more likely than not” that a witness deal will get done? “No,” he said.</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., emphasized to reporters on Wednesday that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/29/Pat-Toomey-Trump-impeachment-trial-Hunter-Biden-John-Bolton/stories/202001290119" target="_blank">he had not advocated for a deal on witnesses</a> and still believed they were unnecessary. And Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. — considered a possible swing vote as he faces re-election this year in a battleground state — told reporters he would vote against calling witnesses.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said in a video posted to Twitter that all the questions “keep coming back to what we’ve been talking about these last seven or eight days, which is relevant witnesses and relevant documents.”</p>
<p>“No manuscript, no book even, is a substitute for having a live witness in a chair,” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Casey asked House Democrats to “speak broadly to the duties of being a public servant and how you believe the president’s actions have violated this trust?” Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., replied that the president had abused his power and betrayed public trust.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey also joined another question led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., about how Mr. Trump’s freeze on aid to Ukraine differed from holds on aid to other countries.</p>
<p>“This is what it’s all about,” Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., responded. “The president abused his authority.”</p>
