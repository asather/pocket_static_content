<h1>Major League Baseball allowing players to leave spring training</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — About a month ago, Pirates players arrived at spring training buoyed by the excitement of a new regime.</p>
<p>Now, many of them are leaving to be closer to their families amid the COVID-19 outbreak, unsure of when the 2020 regular season may start, as well as how or where they’re going to prepare for it.</p>
<p>Speaking on a conference call on Friday afternoon, pitcher Jameson Taillon — the Pirates’ MLBPA representative — discussed several issues confronting the club, as everyone around the sport tries to figure out the best course of action.</p>
<p>Most basic and immediate is where to go. Shortly after Taillon finished talking, the news broke that players would have three options: stay in spring training and receive the normal living allowance; go to Pittsburgh; or go home, with players who don’t live in the United States warned that they might have trouble getting back depending on what happens with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Taillon said he planned to choose the first option, although it had more to do with his Tommy John rehab than anything else.</p>
<p>“For me personally, the best treatment will be here,” Taillon said. “My elbow doesn’t really know there’s a virus going around. I still have to look out for that, too, while also looking out for my safety.”</p>
<p>But the Pirates pitcher also understands the totality of the situation. Several of his teammates have pregnant wives, and they’d rather be there than here, participating in highly optional — and limited — workouts. Others don’t have housing in Florida past the end of the month and have leases beginning in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“At that point I think it’s probably best for guys to be able to go home until we figure out more as far as where we’re going to be and what our timeline and schedule is looking like,” Taillon said.</p>
