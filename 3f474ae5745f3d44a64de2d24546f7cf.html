<h1>Put your two cents in: Banks and stores appeal to customers to mitigate the nationwide coin shortage</h1>

<p>Quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies won’t kill COVID-19, stop people from spreading airborne viral particles or restock a bathroom. But they do have one thing in common with hand sanitizer, N95 face masks and toilet paper: There aren’t enough, and it’s causing problems.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve announced last month that coin distribution would be rationed as a result of dropping coin deposits and production rates — a symptom of the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement said pandemic conditions and the accompanying necessary safety measures had “significantly disrupted the supply chain and normal circulation patterns for U.S. coin.”</p>
<p>Cashless payments continue to rise in popularity nationally, but coins remain a critical part of the economy. The U.S. Mint produced more than 12 billion coins in 2019, which were then distributed to banks across the country.</p>
<p>Banks have noticed the shortage. Marcey Zwiebel,&nbsp;PNC’s director of corporate relations, said in an email that all 2,300 of the $21.6 billion Pittsburgh-based bank’s locations have been “equally affected,” although she declined to comment further.</p>
<p>The shortage is a big enough problem that many stores have started asking customers to avoid paying in cash amounts that require change when possible —&nbsp;or even banned all cash payments. Signs have been appearing at checkouts around the Pittsburgh area in recent weeks.</p>
<p>But going entirely cashless isn’t a solution for people without bank accounts or credit cards (around 8.4 million households in the U.S. are in this situation, according to <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/%20" target="_blank">a 2017 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. survey</a>).</p>
<p>Sheetz, an Altoona-based convenience store chain with 600 locations in six states, started thinking about ways to mitigate the effect of the shortage early on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a lot of retailers in our industry be affected,” said Nick Ruffner, public relations manager. “Gas stations and convenience stores tend to deal with a lot of cash.”</p>
<p>Sheetz has put up signs asking customers to pay with card, phone or exact change in-store, as well as suggesting use of the company’s mobile order-and-pay system.</p>
<p>But it tries to keep open the option of a transaction involving coins. It has helped that the annual Sheetz for the Kidz fundraiser — which collects donations in the form of spare change from customers — has provided a source of coins for the company’s stores (the donations are tracked throughout the fundraiser, and the total amount is donated at the end).</p>
<p>Greensburg-based grocery chain Charley Family Shop ‘N Save has been having an easier time finding enough nickels and dimes, company Vice President Tom Charley said.</p>
<p>The stores are in a “fortunate situation,” he said, because of the company-owned Coinstar machines (coin-deposit stations that convert change into cash and gift cards) that provide a steady supply of coins.</p>
<p>Because of the machines — and some coin rolls brought in by customers in exchange for paper cash — there hasn’t been a notable change in the stores’ operations regarding coins, Mr. Charley said. But he knows that the company has been lucky.</p>
<p>“If I didn’t have that, it’d be extremely impactful,” he said. “The banks are very limited in what they can send us.”</p>
