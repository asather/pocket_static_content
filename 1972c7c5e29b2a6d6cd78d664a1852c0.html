<h1>Allegheny County to resume work Friday on road projects in Penn Hils, Collier and South Hills</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Northeast Paving will resume work Friday on three projects for Allegheny County.</p>
<p>The county’s Department of Public Works said Tuesday that Northeast will resume work at 7 a.m., the earliest allowed under the state’s order authorizing construction to resume under strict social distancing guidelines due to the COVID-19 virus. Northeast has a $10.7 million contract for the projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Short traffic stoppages are expected as the projects resume.</p>
<p>The projects are:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Nadine Road between Allegheny River Boulevard and Nadine Road in Penn Hills, where work includes construction of two lateral-support walls, base repairs and milling and paving. A closure for as long as three months will be needed later this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Thoms Run Road&nbsp;from Forsythe Road to about 600 feet west of Dutch Hill Road in Collier, where work includes drainage repairs, base repairs and milling and paving. Three sections of the road will be closed at various times during the project.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Painters Run Road between Bower Hill Road and Cedar Boulevard in Mt. Lebanon, Scott and Upper St. Clair. The work includes improvements on two bridges as well as&nbsp;guide rail installation, drainage work, base repair and milling and paving that will require full closure at various times.</p>
