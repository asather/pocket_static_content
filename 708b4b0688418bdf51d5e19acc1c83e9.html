<h1>Port Authority will seek grants for remaining $27 million needed for Bus Rapid Transit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Call it the 12% gap.</p>
<p>That’s how much more money Port Authority needs&nbsp;— about $27 million&nbsp;— to finish the local share of funding for the proposed $225 million Bus Rapid Transit system to link Downtown Pittsburgh with Oakland using exclusive bus lanes. The system is designed to make bus service more reliable by keeping buses on schedule rather than several bunching together followed by longer stretches with no service.</p>
<p>The Federal Transit Administration said last week that despite substantial changes that include eliminating full reconstruction of Forbes and Fifth avenues in the Uptown neighborhood, the project remains highly rated. The authority is seeking a $99.5 million award from the Small Starts program to help fund the project.</p>
<p>The only elements believed to be holding back the federal funding are completion of final design — which should be done by September —&nbsp;and demonstration that the authority has the money to complete the project. The authority has commitments for about $98 million of the $125 million the project needs in local funding.</p>
<p>Spokesman Adam Brandolph said the authority is seeking sources for the remaining money but it isn’t concerned that the shortfall could delay the project. Work is expected to begin in 2021 and the system should be in operation by late 2023.</p>
<p>“There are several different ways [to close the funding gap], but the first would be filing for different [government] grants,” Mr. Brandolph said.&nbsp;“There are many options. At this point, we’re going to continue to seek grants.”</p>
<p>In addition to the expected federal grant, the project has funding commitments from Allegheny County ($31.5 million), Pittsburgh ($20.25 million), FTA for vehicles ($18 million) and Pennsylvania ($6.75 million). The authority also will contribute $22.5 million to the project.</p>

<p>If the agency hasn’t covered the remaining $27 million by the time final design is completed, then it will find another way to proceed with the project, Mr. Brandolph said. From the beginning, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald has said the system, which will link two of the three busiest economic activity neighborhoods in the state, is so important that the county would find another source of funding if it didn’t qualify for the federal grant.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“We will work with our partners and develop a solution,” Mr. Brandolph said. “There are other options we have beyond [grants], but I don’t want to go into that at this time.”</p>
<p>The project will involve the authority supplementing its existing fleet with 15 articulated, electric buses dedicated to Bus Rapid Transit. Those buses and others will provide inbound service from Oakland on Fifth Avenue and outbound via Forbes Avenue using dedicated lanes that will have signal priority at intersections.</p>
<p>The system also will have spurs that extend to Wilkinsburg via the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway as well as Highland Park and Squirrel Hill on city streets where buses will have priority lanes at intersections to move through traffic lights quicker.</p>
<p>Buses from the East End, eastern suburbs and Monongahela Valley that pass through Oakland also will use the dedicated lanes.</p>
<p>The system also will have protected bike lanes on Fifth Avenue between Downtown and Oakland with the Oakland lanes operating in what is now the contraflow lane for buses.&nbsp;</p>
