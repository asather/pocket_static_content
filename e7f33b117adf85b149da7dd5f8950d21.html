<h1>Port Authority driver charged with involuntary manslaughter in bus crash that killed Pitt student</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The driver of a Port Authority bus was charged Wednesday with involuntary manslaughter and three other counts after the bus she was driving struck and killed a University of Pittsburgh senior in January.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police said in a criminal complaint that driver Shavonne James, 33, had her view blocked by a passenger she had picked up where there was no bus stop and struck pedestrian Barbara Como, 20, as she and two others were legally crossing DeSoto Street at Fifth Avenue on Jan. 18. Ms. James of Squirrel Hill also was charged with hitting a pedestrian in a crosswalk, reckless driving and engaging in unlawful activities for driving while her view was blocked.</p>
<p>Ms. Como of Chester Springs, Pa., was walking on Fifth Avenue at DeSoto Street at 12:38 p.m. when she was struck by the bus. She was an anthropology major who was scheduled to graduate in the spring and planned to be a research psychologist.</p>
<p>In a criminal complaint prepared by Officer Ronald Wolfe of the Collision Investigation Unit, police said Ms. James picked up a passenger at&nbsp;“an undesignated stop” at Fifth Avenue and Desoto Street. Video from cameras on the bus, a traffic signal and a nearby building showed the passenger removed gloves and stayed in the front of the bus, beyond the line where passengers are supposed to stand, fumbling through his pockets.</p>
<p>With the passenger still standing too far forward, the complaint said, Ms. James resumed driving and turned right onto DeSoto, where the bus struck Ms. Como behind the right front wheel. The bus continued moving and ran over the victim with its rear wheels.</p>
<p>The traffic light on Fifth Avenue was green, and pedestrians had a walk signal when the incident occurred, police said. The other two pedestrians in the intersection were not injured.</p>
<p>Ms. Como’s death was a&nbsp;“direct result” of Ms. James driving with a passenger blocking her view of mirrors in violation of federal regulations.</p>
<p>“The passenger blocked the view of the mirrors of the bus, making it difficult [for the driver] to safely turn right. [The driver] operated the bus in an unsafe condition by moving with a standing passenger,” the complaint said.</p>
<p>Police said Ms. James told them she had stopped at the intersection before turning right and while she was turning passengers yelled at her. She said she drove about 5 more feet and then looked at her mirrors and saw the pedestrian on the ground before she stopped.</p>
<p>Another driver, Robert McSweeney, told police he was driving immediately behind Ms. James. He told them he&nbsp;“did not know how the driver did not see” the pedestrians in the intersection.</p>
<p>Ms. James, a bus driver with the authority since Aug. 8, 2016, has been on paid leave since the accident. Her salary was $51,867.</p>
<p>Since charges have been filed, authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said Ms. James has been suspended pending an internal disciplinary hearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This was an absolute tragedy,” Mr. Brandolph said.&nbsp;“Our hearts go out to Miss Como’s family.”&nbsp;</p>
