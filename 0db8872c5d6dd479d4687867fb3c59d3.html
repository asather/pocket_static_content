<h1>Groups sue Allegheny County officials alleging mistreatment of inmates with psychiatric disabilities </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two civil rights groups and a Downtown law firm sued Allegheny County health and jail officials on Tuesday on the grounds that the county jail has long been mistreating inmates with psychiatric disabilities in violation of the U.S. constitution.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs allege in the federal complaint that the jail is "rife with systemic deficiencies that deprive people with psychiatric disabilities of necessary care, and indeed, make their conditions worse."</p>
<p>The complaint also says the jail's "superficial or non-existent diagnostic care," lack of counseling services or group therapy, mismanagement of medication and "culture of punishment rather than treatment" amount to a system that rarely provides any real treatment.</p>
<p>It also says the mental health department is severely understaffed and has been for many years.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs are Shaquille Howard, James Byrd, Jason Porter, Keisha Cohen and Albert Castaphany, represented by the Pittsburgh law firm of Schnader Harrison Segal &amp; Lewis, the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project and the Abolitionist Law Project.</p>
<p>The defendants are Laura Williams, the chief deputy of healthcare services; Warden Orlando Harper; Mental Health Director Michael Barfield; and Allegheny County.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs are all jail inmates who suffer from psychiatric disabilities and have not received proper care, according to the suit.</p>
<p>Among other claims, the suit alleges violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act for the jail's "failure to provide adequate mental health care and its discriminatory and brutal treatment of people with psychiatric disabilities."</p>
<p>Mr. Howard, for example, suffers from depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and other issues and has spent over a year in solitary confinement, causing worsening depression and suicide ideation, the complaint says. He has also been sprayed in the face with OC spray while handcuffed and placed in a restraint chair multiple times when in need of mental health care, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>After jail staff and correctional officers ignored his requests for treatment and an officer encouraged him to commit suicide, the complaint says, Mr. Howard tried to hang himself on Feb. 10, 2020.</p>
<p>Mr. Byrd, another inmate, suffers from bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety and PTSD. He has been repeatedly issued misconduct punishments and kept in solitary for seeking mental health or medical care, the complaint says.</p>
<p>"He has been placed in the restraint chair approximately 20 times or more, including one instance of being strapped to the chair for 28 hours," the suit says. "These conditions have caused his mental health to deteriorate, and led to a series of self-harm attempts."</p>
<p>The other inmates have been similarly mistreated, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>The suit is seeking class action status for all inmates with similar histories at the jail.</p>
<p>At a news conference announcing the suit, attorney Alexandra Morgan-Kurtz of the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project said the investigation leading to the suit took a year and some 400 interviews of inmates, families and former jail staffers.</p>
<p>"Allegheny County has absolutely failed in its obligations" to provide treatment for inmates, she said.</p>
<p>Attorney Bret Grote of the Abolitionist Law Center said that the jail staff has been quick to use OC spray, restraint chairs and other punishments on inmates with psychiatric problems instead of providing the help they need.</p>
<p>"We've met many people who have been strapped to a restraint chair for eight hours, sometimes naked," he said. "Many people have been subjected to this degrading, torturous practice multiple times."</p>
<p>The suit says that although the jail houses many people with psychiatric disabilities, the facility lacks proper intake screening, medication management, counseling, suicide prevention and training.</p>
<p>"We recognize there are many employees at ACJ who try their best to provide care, yet face an impossible task due to inadequate systems, resources and direction," said Keith Whitson of Schnader Harrison Segal &amp; Lewis. "This lawsuit focuses primarily on the illegal systemic failures that make treatment nearly nonexistent, and the frequent imposition of punishment in place of treatment."</p>
<p>The civil rights groups said the jail has one of the highest suicide rates in the United States as a result. They also said that the conditions and practices harm black people disproportionately because 61 percent of those held in the jail are black, even though Allegheny County's black population is 13.4 percent.</p>
<p>In addition, they said, most people leave the jail worse off than when they went in, making it harder for them to re-integrate into the community.</p>
<p>“Allegheny County is failing its most vulnerable communities by incarcerating people with psychiatric disabilities and then refusing to uphold its moral and constitutional obligation to provide treatment,” said Ms. Morgan-Kurtz.</p>
<p>The county does not comment on pending litigation.</p>
