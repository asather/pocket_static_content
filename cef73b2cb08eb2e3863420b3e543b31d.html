<h1>Whitehall man charged with vandalizing police car during Downtown protest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A 26-year-old man is in jail after he being charged with vandalizing a Pittsburgh police cruiser that was set on fire May 30 in Downtown Pittsburgh as a planned demonstration against police brutality turned destructive.</p>
<p>Police have charged Shaheed Hatch of Whitehall with rioting, theft and vandalism, among other charges.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatch was arrested, authorities say, after multiple tips led to a photo on Instagram that showed him — after a large-scale protest following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in police custody — holding a stop sign on Washington Place while wearing a Pittsburgh police vest backwards as an unmarked cruiser is ablaze behind him.</p>
<p>The Downtown demonstration turned destructive with the vandalism and burning of a marked Pittsburgh police car, authorities say, during which Mr. Hatch was observed standing nearby. He then leaves the scene, grabs a construction sign and uses its metal pole to smash an unmarked police car's windows, according to a criminal complaint filed Wednesday in the case.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatch is then seen grabbing another man's container of yellow liquid and pouring the substance onto a rag near the cruiser's tailpipe, according to police.</p>
<p>After other people&nbsp;add more flammable objects, the police vehicle is aflame — causing multiple small explosions "that could have endangered innocent civilians or [e]mergency responders," according to the complaint — and everyone involved leaves the scene.</p>
<p>Police&nbsp;also say multiple videos show Mr. Hatch pick up a police life vest and put it on.</p>
<p>Four days later, Pittsburgh narcotics detectives working a Pleasant Hills demonstration say Mr. Hatch spoke with them about recent events in Pittsburgh. The detectives say they were able to identify Mr. Hatch as a man from the May 30 rioting.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatch is in jail on $25,000 bond.</p>
<p>“When I saw the video of George Floyd being murdered it sent a shockwave through my entire soul,” he said in his Instagram post.&nbsp;“So I went to protest peacefully.</p>
<p>“Once things got out of hand due to a select few&nbsp;… people and cops I saw this vest and stop sign on the ground and picked it up. The reverse side of the stop sign reads slow. I wanted the message to be clear for people to stop and slow down to think about why things are happening.”</p>
