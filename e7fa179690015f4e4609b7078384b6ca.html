<h1>Gene Therapy: Good neighbor Joe to run marathon on one street</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Among the most welcome arrivals to my email are sporadic observations from longtime friend and neighbor Joe Tedesco, even as they appear less frequently now that I no longer appear on the Nightly Sports Call, which, thanks to me, was for the past 11 years unquestionably the worst show on television.</p>
<p>Joe liked to comment on that.</p>
<p>Among Joe’s most recent messages was an advisory that he was plotting the route of his virtual marathon, shaping up as 42 loops of Wedgewood Drive, my street in the North Hills. Since I did not know what a virtual marathon was, I figured he was joking.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>A serious runner for the past quarter century or so — he’s done the Pittsburgh Marathon 15 times — his typical morning regimen of six miles almost always includes my street. Though he lives a few streets away, he’s often the first person I see when I leave the house in the morning. You know, like when you used to leave the house in the morning?</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve sometimes identified various sporting events that, if they were taking place outside my window, I’d close the blinds. The NFL draft would be one of those. But in the case of the first ever Wedgewood Marathon — essentially one guy running around this paperclip-shaped loop 42 times – I’ll likely make an exception.</p>
<p>But Joe, why Wedgewood?</p>
<p>“I wanted something that was safe and convenient,” he said. “And I thought if I could talk any of my family into joining me, or any of my friends, for a loop or two around, that would make it easier for me. The other reason is that the neighborhood is friendly enough that if something went haywire, you know, and I plan on bringing some water, energy drinks, my Vaseline if I need it, my phone. I was gonna set it somewhere near your place to be safe.”</p>
<p>For all its not-readily-evident charms, Wedgewood cannot offer marathoners, I mean marathoner, the energizing experience of pounding through Pittsburgh’s topographical crazy quilt of neighborhoods and cityscapes. The energy will mostly be generated by what I’d guess to be about a dozen Wedgewood dogs that diligently monitor the street proceedings. The two alert young boxers next door are going to lose their, uh, you know, over this, but they are good dogs who don’t approach the invisible fencing.</p>
<p>A small tract of mostly working-class homes hammered into a former fruit orchard in the ’50s, Wedgewood is indeed safe, convenient, and friendly, the kind of neighborhood of which people interviewed on the news say, “nothing like this ever happens around here.”</p>
<p>It’s also pretty boring. One drive around the loop yields not much to look at (unless Jim has his sweet black Buick Lacrosse out of the garage), so good luck with 26 miles in 42 loops at a marathoner’s pace.</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m a boring guy,” Joe said. “It’s why I run alone.”</p>
<p>We’re all boring in our way, I suppose, but I’ve mostly found Joe solid, disciplined, and wry. Graduated from St. Mary’s in McKees Rocks in ’72 and went right to work for Giant Eagle. Stayed 44 years. His daughter and our son were schoolmates for 17 years. One minute they were chewing on waffles shaped like Mickey Mouse’s head in the dining room before elementary school, the next they were slamming adult beverages in one of Ohio University’s infamous adjacent saloons. Even that was 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Hadn’t thought about this until recently, but seeing Joe Tedesco run in the mornings all these years is one of the great comforts of the neighborhood, and the fact is, he’s provided it despite some serious obstacles.</p>
<p>There was the heart attack in ’03, when he was 49, requiring two stents for a 95% blockage in one passage and 90% in another. He was back to running not six months later. There was last year’s stress fracture, which somehow did not prevent him from running the Pittsburgh Marathon.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t feeling well after the marathon, wasn’t having good times running, it was taking me forever,” he said. “Did a stress test, found out there was some blockage again. I was laying on the table and the doctor said, ‘Well, you do have quite a bit here,’ he told me 90%. I asked how blocked it had been during the marathon. He said about 90%. So I guess I dealt with it.”</p>
<p>Healthy again, this time ought to be a breeze, a veritable walk in the park, not that we’ve got a park. Of course, it won’t be; Joe knows he’ll have to play all his marathon mind games to perfection, as ever.</p>
<p>“In the marathon I have my different stretches where I question, ‘Why am I doin’ this? If turn here, I can go back, and I could be home.’ You know the (first) finishers are home and I’m still hitting my halfway point. But once I get into the teens, halfway, 13, 14 miles, you really say, ‘You can quit this. Don’t do this.’ And then I get to 20 and I say, ‘Ah, this is nothing more than a morning run now, six more miles to go.’</p>
<p>“I’ll try to trick myself. I’ll think, ‘Here comes mile marker 17,’ and it’s really 19, that kind of thing. There’s a handful of emotions that kick in when I know I’m gonna finish...relief,&nbsp;accomplishment, pride, and the joy that I see in the faces of my loved ones and supporters.”</p>
<p>Joe’s best marathon times have come in the neighborhood of four hours, 20 minutes. This year, in the virtual marathon, you can run it anywhere, any time, then submit your smart-watch recorded data to the Pittsburgh race website for registry and comparison.</p>
<p>Joe’s already gotten some blowback on his suggested start time. If you’re reading this on Saturday morning, he’s probably running right now, if he’s not already finished.</p>
<p>“I’ve told people whatever time I get out of bed, it might be 5:30, 6 o’clock, and that might be too early to get anybody to join me.”</p>
<p>Well yeah, that will eliminate me. Also, the running part.</p>
<p>But I’ll be out there clapping before long, and Joe can count on me not to steal his watch. Nothing like that ever happens around here.</p>
