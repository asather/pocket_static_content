<h1>Paul Zeise: NBA and MLS are hoping their bubbles don’t burst</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Way back in March when the COVID-19 pandemic began, there was a pipe dream that sports could come back in a bubble. Literally.</p>
<p>The thought was there would be a bubble city for each of the leagues. All teams would report there, players would be effectively quarantined and all the games would take place in the same arena.</p>
<p>There were plenty of skeptics of this idea. It was seen as unrealistic and not something athletes would go for. It was thought to be impractical and the plans had too many too holes to be considered realistic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of those theories will be put to the test over the next few weeks by the MLS and the NBA. Both leagues have chosen Orlando as their bubble city and teams from both leagues have already reported. The NBA players have begun to get tested, and so far only a dozen or so have tested positive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t know if this going to work, but I will be brutally honest — I never thought they’d even get to the point where teams would start reporting to a bubble city.</p>
<p>The most important reason is that I didn’t think players would sign off on it. The leagues have made some concessions to make it more attractive to be sequestered in one city, but asking players to go to a single city for two or three months seemed like a bridge too far.</p>
<p>Also, the health and safety issues seemed to be overwhelming. The number of tests it would take alone seemed astronomical. And keeping players socially distanced and separated from other people working in the bubble also seemed unrealistic.</p>
<p>The NBA has had a few players opt out of playing, but very few. The overwhelming majority of players will report and play, assuming the season goes on. It is crazy to think that we could be watching NBA games in a few weeks, but we are closing in on it.</p>
<p>The bubble will be tested, though, because cases are on the rise in Florida right now. They have closed bars and are talking about putting some more restrictions in place to slow down the spread of COVID-19. That is one reason why there were some questioning whether it was still smart to go to Florida. But again, if the bubble is held true and players and coaches and staffers all stay within it, they should be fine.</p>
<p>There are still more questions than answers at this point. What happens if one player teats positive? How about one team? And if they are all in a bubble together, isn’t that a recipe for a breakout if the virus finds its way inside? These are all things that have been discussed and considered, but until they actually happen, there is no way to know what could happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MLS seems to be in a better position to succeed than the NBA because that sport is outside. And it is probably a little easier to keep players socially distanced outside than inside. But they face many of the same challenges in the bubble, especially when the players are off the field and in the hotels.</p>
<p>The NBA bubble concept will not have fans but it is actually going to be fan friendly since they have an aggressive schedule of games. They will have to try and play about eight games a day in order to get all of the regular season games in.</p>
<p>That means we would have wall to wall coverage of NBA games to watch all day, every day. That’s the trade off for fans not being in the stands, but it is a good one.</p>
<p>I have no idea if we will have MLS or NBA to watch yet. They took the first step, though, and actually have arrived in the bubble, and that’s a lot more than I thought we would get to see. Maybe the bubble idea is actually going to become a reality.</p>
