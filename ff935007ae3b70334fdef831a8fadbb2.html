<h1>U.S. Department of Transportation releases framework for hyperloop development</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Proposed&nbsp;hyperloop transportation systems, which developers say can move pods with passengers or freight through low-pressure tubes at more than 500 miles an hour, have received a key endorsement: validation by the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao released a 22-page document Thursday called <a title="Pathways to the Future of Transportation" href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2020-07/NETT_Pathways_jul20_final_3.pdf" target="_blank">Pathways to the Future of Transportation</a> that’s designed to encourage innovation and place new transportation concepts under a specific regulatory agency. The document was developed by the Non-Traditional and Emerging Transportation Technology Council that Ms. Chao appointed about 18 months ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For hyperloop advocates, the important step was placing hyperloop proposals under the Federal Railroad Administration and making hyperloop projects eligible for federal grants to help fund projects.</p>
<p>“This is a turning point for the industry,” said Ryan Kelly, vice president of Virgin Hyperloop One, one of two developers proposing systems to link Pittsburgh with Chicago.</p>
<p>“It gives confidence to stakeholders that this is a priority. This is not a pipe dream.”</p>
<p>Virgin is working with the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission on a system that would connect Pittsburgh to Chicago via Columbus in about 56 minutes at a cost of about $93. The agency has completed environmental and feasibility studies for the system, which likely would be built in sections from west to east and take about 30 years to complete.</p>
<p>“Just the Federal Railroad Administration alignment for hyperloop is a big announcement,” said Thea Ewing,&nbsp;director of transportation for the Mid-Ohio group. “That alone is a pretty significant message from the U.S. Department of Transportation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Once you get to this point and you don’t have an answer for who regulates you, you don’t know what to do. [The proposal] becomes a non-starter for whoever you’re talking to.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly said the other important component to Thursday’s announcement is making hyperloop projects eligible for federal funding. The&nbsp;Pittsburgh-to-Chicago proposal always has been pitched as a public-private partnership, but at a cost of more than $20 billion it would be difficult for local agencies to pay for the public share by themselves.</p>
<p>The report said that once the technology is proven, hyperloop projects could be eligible under four different funding categories that have a combined $2 billion available in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>“This is an opportunity to compete,” Mr. Kelly said.&nbsp;“We are at the point where we want to get safety certified. We feel confident in our technology.”</p>
<p>The company operates a facility with a <a title="Virgin Hyperloop One test track" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2018/05/21/Virgin-Hyperloop-One-Mojave-Desert-test-facility-Nevada-transportation-high-speed/stories/201805200096" target="_blank">500-meter test track near Las Vegas</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other proposed hyperloop project with a Pittsburgh component is being developed by the&nbsp;Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency in Cleveland and would connect Pittsburgh to Chicago on a path through Cleveland and along the Great Lakes. That group is working with another technology firm,&nbsp;Hyperloop Transportation Technologies Inc.</p>
<p>Rob Miller, chief marketing officer for Hyperloop TT, said the DOT decision shows hyperloop technology&nbsp;“has moved into the mainstream in the government’s eyes.”</p>
<p>“The first thing is it shows the work that has been done [on the Cleveland project] really left an impression on them,” he said. That project has completed a feasibility study and soon will begin an environmental impact statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly said the next step is moving ahead with the selection of a site for government testing and certification. Virgin is reviewing proposals for possible locations for the several hundred million dollar center&nbsp;— including a site in central Ohio pushed by Ms. Ewing’s agency and one in West Virginia working with West Virginia University — and expects to pick a site by the fall, six months earlier that originally anticipated.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen some really strong proposals and we want to get started,” Mr. Kelly said.</p>
