<h1>Allegheny County selects new health department director</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dr. Deborah Bogen has been selected as the new director of the Allegheny County Health Department.</p>
<p>County Executive Rich Fitzgerald made the announcement at a news conference Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen’s appointment will be voted on by the county board of health Wednesday afternoon. Her appointment must also be confirmed by the state Department of Health. She is slated to assume the position on May 4.</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen is the vice chair for education in the Department of Pediatrics with UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>She earned her medical degree from the University of Colorado School of Medicine and completed post-graduate work at Johns Hopkins University. One of the founders of the Mid-Atlantic Mothers’ Milk Bank, she has been an advocate for issues of maternal and child health.</p>
<p>“This is an incredible opportunity to serve the community,” said Dr. Bogen, who described herself as “a community advocate for children’s health.”</p>
<p>She said the county must improve his infant mortality rate and said air quality is a “huge, important issue.”</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald said the search committee conducted a nationwide search but selected someone local who knows the county system.</p>
<p>Dr. Edie Shapira, a member of the board of health and the search committee, said Dr. Bogen is “strong, brave, strategic, and personally delightful.”</p>
<p>The search committee was co-chaired by Dr. Shapira and Grant Oliphant, CEO of the Heinz Endowments, with the help of search firm, Krauthamer &amp; Associates.</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen replaces Dr. Karen Hacker, who left for a position with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year.</p>
<p>County Controller Chelsa Wagner criticized the process used to select Dr. Bogen.</p>
<p>“While having in place a new Allegheny County Health Department director is certainly desirable given the critical challenges — globally and locally — that we face in the arena of public health, the more than nine-month period since Dr. Karen Hacker’s resignation announcement should have included robust public input and involvement and, ultimately, a public vetting of candidates under consideration. Instead, residents including health and environmental advocates had no indication where this process stood or that this announcement was imminent, Ms. Wagner said in a press release.</p>
<p>“It is important to remember that the recent, incremental improvements in Health Department enforcement of air quality regulations only followed scrutiny from my office through its performance audits and subsequent demands from the community. Similarly, the Department denied responsibility and failed to take meaningful action on Pittsburgh’s lead water crisis, and presented inaccurate blood lead testing data to the public. Accountability is what makes government work, and the public should have every confidence that these unfortunate episodes will not be repeated,” Ms. Wagner continued.</p>
<p>“A critical personnel decision affecting every resident of Allegheny County — especially the most vulnerable — should not have been made behind closed doors. Neither our elected representatives on County Council nor local public health advocates have vetted this appointment.”</p>
