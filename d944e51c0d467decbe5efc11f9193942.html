<h1>Fashion find of the week: Feel-good summer fashions from Whimsical Wardrobe Boutique</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COVID-19 has not only slowed sales for brick-and-mortar stores but also for fashion retailers on wheels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marissa Zimmerman decided before the new coronavirus outbreak to give her seven-year-old mobile boutique a makeover, rebranding it from the Vintage Valet to Whimsical Wardrobe Boutique.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The name was kind of misleading. I sold vintage-inspired clothes,” she said, “but I would get calls like,&nbsp;‘My great-grandmother or aunt passed away and has a whole attic full of vintage. Do you buy this?’ I just wanted to rebrand with something more general.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word&nbsp;“whimsical” is a nod to the aesthetic of the fashion truck’s clothing for sale: very romantic and feminine, with lots of lace, ruffles, embroidery, crocheted touches and a hint of sparkle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For summer, she’s stocked pleated dresses and plenty of bold, neon pieces, she said. Plus, there are colorful shell accessories to dress them up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s been tough, though, for Ms. Zimmerman to show off the truck’s new name — and her new inventory — because of restrictions prompted by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We primarily rely on events to do our business, so we’ve kind of had to pivot and focus more online and doing Facebook Live,” she said.</p>
<p>Now that Allegheny County and surrounding areas have entered the green phase, she’s optimistic about appearing at a few events this summer, including the farmer’s market in Bethel Park. Teaming with other businesses for a pop-up shop or holding a private shopping party with the truck by request outside someone’s house are other in-person options. Some items also are for sale inside Jacqueline’s Salon &amp; Spa on Grant Street, Downtown.</p>
<p>In the meantime, people can shop Whimsical Wardrobe Boutique online at whimsicalwardrobeboutique.com and on Facebook @WhimsicalWardrobeBoutique. Keep an eye on the website for updates to the truck’s event schedule.&nbsp;</p>
