<h1>Pittsburgh school board urged to change student-athlete eligibility policy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>More than a dozen people Monday evening endorsed introducing an intervention program into the Pittsburgh Public Schools student-athlete eligibility policy.</p>
<p>Participating in the program would afford students who fall below the 2.0 GPA eligibility requirement an opportunity to remain a part of school sports teams.</p>
<p>Parents, coaches and City League supporters encouraged the policy change in pre-written statements that were read aloud by district administrators during a virtual public hearing before the school board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The phrase&nbsp;‘it’s a privilege to play a sport’ has been used my whole life,” wrote city resident Jason Russell. “As I have gotten older, I’ve realized that for many high school athletes, sports is not a privilege — it’s a tool. A tool to teach students discipline, accountability, effort, responsibility, along with a family atmosphere that may be the most positive atmosphere some of these players have.”</p>
<p>Under the proposed policy, students with a 1.05 to 1.99 GPA at the end of the previous report period would be entered into the district’s academic intervention program.&nbsp;Students would be able to maintain their eligibility by&nbsp;completing the academic intervention program&nbsp;designated by the superintendent or designee and earning a 2.0 GPA&nbsp;by the end of the next report period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That would be a change from the current Pittsburgh Public Schools policy, which dictates that a student with less than a 2.0 GPA loses eligibility for the year.</p>
<p>“Exclusion is the worst consequence,” wrote Anthony Ferguson, a parent and coach. “During the time of exclusion is when I see a lot of students make bad decisions or surround themselves with peers engaging in negative behaviors.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students would be required to&nbsp;“fully participate” in the intervention program to be able to continue to play school sports, district spokeswoman Ebony Pugh said. Details of the intervention program were still being worked out, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools’ 2.0 GPA eligibility standard is higher than what is required by many school districts in the region as well as the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association.</p>
<p>“What’s happening with the grades for athletes being reduced a little bit can only help get more participants and better athletic teams with some of our kids coming back to the City League instead of leaving for WPIAL schools,”&nbsp;wrote Allderdice High School football coach Jerry Haslett, “which in turn will boost student morale, behavior and make for a more competitive league.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school board is expected to vote on the proposed policy change at the June 24 legislative meeting.</p>
