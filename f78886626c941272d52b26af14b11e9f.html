<h1>Low ridership during COVID-19 paints a bleak financial picture for Port Authority</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority’s&nbsp;chief finance officer told a board committee Thursday that the full effect of ridership cuts and rising expenses as a result of the COVID-19 virus won’t be known until at least May, but what he did say paints a bleak picture.</p>
<p>Pete Schenk told the committee during a video meeting the agency’s passenger revenue for last week was about $20,000. Under normal circumstances, the agency averages about $1.2 million a week in passenger revenue, which accounts for about 20% of its revenue.</p>
<p>Ridership on April 10, the most recent day available, showed the system carried 37,060 riders, down 83% from the same day in 2019. Passenger revenue for a month usually is between $7 million and $8 million — including students whose riders are paid by their school or college and weren’t part of last week’s figures — probably will be closer to $500,000 for April, Mr. Schenk said.</p>

<p>For March, which had about two weeks of ridership drops due to the novel coronavirus, overall revenue was down about $1 million, but Mr. Schenk said that was misleading because it included about $2 million in revenue from February.</p>
<p>“You’re definitely going to see [the financial implications] in the April statements,” Mr. Schenk said.</p>
<p>The agency said earlier this month it expects lost revenue and higher costs for cleaning supplies and overtime for cleaning crews that sanitize buses daily to reach $30 million by the end of the fiscal year June 30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is the agency continues to be under budget for expenses for the year and has $153.7 million in reserve funds. Additionally, Congress has approved $125 billion in federal reimbursements for transit agencies as a result of the virus and Port Authority is eligible for $141.75 million.</p>
<p>Because of ridership declines, the agency reduced service by about 25% last month and to curb the spread of the virus has passengers entering from rear doors. That means cash customers ride for free.</p>
