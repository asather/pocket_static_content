<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County police are investigating a stabbing Tuesday afternoon in Avalon.</p>
<p>An Avalon police officer on patrol around 12:45 p.m. near the Red, White &amp; Blue Thrift Store on Ohio River Boulevard heard screams for help and found a man bleeding from his chest.</p>
<p>The man had been stabbed and was transported to Allegheny General Hospital in critical condition.</p>
<p>The victim and suspect had been involved in a verbal altercation over a woman,&nbsp;according to county police detectives assisting with the investigation. Police said the suspect had produced a weapon and stabbed the victim numerous times.</p>
<p>The suspect was identified as Patrick Giesy, 39.</p>
<p>A witness to the incident, who police identified as the victim’s ex-lover, told police they called the victim to assist with their car battery, according to the criminal affidavit. The victim then followed the witness back to an apartment to make sure they arrived without further car trouble.</p>
<p>The victim got out of his car, said goodbye to the witness and gave the person a hug. Soon after, the witness heard Giesy, the current boyfriend, yell out from the witness’s third-story balcony,&nbsp;“Oh, this is what we doin’ now.”</p>
<p>The witness explained to police they had been arguing with Giesy earlier in the day. Geisy came down and began yelling and arguing with the victim.</p>
<p>The witness said they thought Giesy and the victim were throwing punches and had tried to break up the fight, when they noticed the victim was bleeding from his back and abdomen. They said they heard the victim say,&nbsp;“He got me. I’m hit.”</p>
<p>The witness did not say they saw Giesy with a knife, but told police Giesy carried one.</p>
<p>Giesy fled the scene and has not been located.</p>
<p>Medical staff at Allegheny General told police the victim was in surgery and had eight puncture wounds to his back, torso and abdomen.</p>
<p>A warrant was issued for Giesy’s arrest on charges of aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person. Geisy has had a criminal record dating back to 2000 and is a felon.</p>
<p>Anyone with information on this incident is asked to call the&nbsp;Allegheny County Police Tipline at 1-833-ALL-TIPS (1-833-255-8477). Callers can remain anonymous.</p>
