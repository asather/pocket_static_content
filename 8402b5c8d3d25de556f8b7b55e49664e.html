<h1>Penn State football will kick off athletes' return to campus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State is one major step closer to playing that Labor Day weekend game against Kent State at Beaver Stadium.</p>
<p>The school announced Thursday that Nittany Lion athletes will begin a&nbsp;phased approach to return to campus Monday, starting with 75 football players.</p>
<p>Players have started a “prescribed quarantine” in preparation for their return to campus, the school said in a statement. Each athlete will be tested for COVID-19 and quarantined once they arrive to University Park. If all is well, they will be allowed to engage in voluntary workouts on campus.</p>
<p>Those workouts are scheduled to begin June 15. They&nbsp;will be limited in size (groups of fewer than 20 athletes), and Penn State’s performance enhancement and sports medicine staff will supervise every conditioning drill.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to the return of our student-athletes in the coming weeks and hope this is the first steps to a full return for the fall,” athletic director Sandy Barbour said in a statement. “We are appreciative of President (Eric) Barron for including [intercollegiate athletics] in this first wave of students coming back to campus.”</p>
<p>The school will have a phased return to campus for each of the 31 athletic programs. Those will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>“We are very confident in our plan and will continue to keep the health, safety and well-being of our students, coaches, staff, and community as our top priority,” Barbour said. “Our outstanding sports performance group worked with medical experts at both the University, conference, and national level, as well as University leadership in developing an extensive return to campus plan for our student-athletes, staff, and facilities.”</p>
<p>The school says it is following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local government guidelines, along with recommendations from the NCAA Sport Science Institute and the Big Ten Conference’s task force for Emerging Infectious Disease, during this process.&nbsp;Protocols for athletes and staff include wearing masks, daily health screenings and small group activities.</p>
<p>Here is a more detailed list of the protocols according to the university.</p>
<p>• Education for all student-athletes, coaches and staff on Penn State’s COVID safety protocols.</p>
<p>• Mandatory daily health screening questionnaire and temperature check for student-athletes, coaches and staff.</p>
<p>• Required use of personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>
<p>• Adherence to social distancing guidelines for meetings and workouts, including the use of smaller groups for performance enhancement sessions.</p>
<p>• Enhanced cleaning for all athletics facilities.</p>
<p>• Limited and monitored access to facilities.</p>
