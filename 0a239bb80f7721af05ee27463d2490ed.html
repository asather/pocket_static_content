<h1>Tailgating will not be allowed Sunday on North Shore</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Football will be played on Sunday, but tailgaters won't be part of the festivities.</p>
<p>The parking lots and garages near Heinz Field will be closed, except for one, Gold Lot 2, which is bounded by North Shore Drive, Chuck Noll Way, W. General Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive.</p>
<p>That lot will open at 8 a.m., but Alco Parking Corp., which manages the lots on the North Shore, said tailgating will be forbidden.</p>
<p>“Anyone tailgating will be asked to leave,” said Ralph Reetz, Alco’s general manager.</p>
<p>The parking lot is open to those looking to visit the North Shore's restaurants, Mr. Reetz said.</p>
<p>The booths will be manned by lot attendants, he said.</p>
<p>While the city typically tows vehicles on certain streets — even the free, metered spots — during game days, that policy will not be enforced on Sunday, according to a manager at the Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The manager added that parking will not be allowed on General Robinson Street between Art Rooney Avenue and Chuck Noll Way.</p>
<p>The Steelers host Denver at 1 p.m. Sunday.</p>
