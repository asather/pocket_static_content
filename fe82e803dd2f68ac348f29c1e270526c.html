<h1>Pa. regulators reject calls for extended review of utility shutoff ban</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three out of four members of the state’s Public Utility Commission have finally agreed on something related to the ongoing moratorium on utility shutoffs.</p>
<p>For the first time in months, the four-member commission has broken the tie that hampered any movement on the topic. On Thursday, the regulators denied an effort by advocacy groups to launch a formal proceeding to decide how and when the moratorium should end won a majority of votes on the commission, whose one tie-breaking seat has been empty since the spring.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The PUC unanimously forbade utilities to shut off non-paying clients in March just as the country began to grasp the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and Gov. Tom Wolf ordered residents to shelter in place.</p>
<p>Since then, the commissioners have been unable to agree on a path forward.</p>
<p>Two members of the commission have wanted to end the moratorium since June, arguing that customers are accruing unpaid bills that they may be unable to pay in the future and that the indefinite halt in terminations may hurt utilities and, by extension, all of their customers.</p>
<p>The other two commissioners have been more cautious, hoping to wait until there are concrete plans in place to assist those in danger of being shut off and warning that Pennsylvania’s economy is far from being back to normal.</p>
<p>The petition, filed last month by a coalition of groups representing senior citizens, tenants and low-income utility customers, asked for a public review process to gauge the impact of lifting the moratorium and to develop a plan to deal with accrued utility debts.</p>
<p>Their proposal was similar to what Chairwoman Gladys Brown Dutrieuille proposed in July, when she asked to convene a stakeholder group headed by the PUC’s staff to hash out these issues. When that was voted down, Ms. Dutrieuille wrote a letter last month inviting comments from these stakeholders in a less formal way.</p>
<p>The receipt of those comments — nearly everyone who weighed in other than the utilities urged the commission to keep the moratorium in place, while all the utilities asked to lift it — means the PUC has already given a voice to stakeholders, the commission’s staff wrote in the motion to reject the petition, which was approved on Thursday.</p>
<p>Chairwoman Dutrieuille agreed, although she left open the possibility that a stakeholder process may be needed in the future.</p>
<p>Commissioner David Sweet was the one dissent on Thursday.</p>
<p>“Like the petitioners, I believe that prior to ending the moratorium, there should be a plan in place,” he wrote.</p>
<p>The input that the commission has received following the chairwoman’s letter last month hasn’t resulted in a strategy, he noted.</p>
<p>Referring to Ms. Dutrieuille’s original proposal for a stakeholder process back in July, Mr. Sweet bemoaned: “It is unfortunate that we did not act to establish the collaborative then, and it remains unfortunate that we are not establishing it now.”</p>
<p>The moratorium on shutoffs remains in place.</p>
