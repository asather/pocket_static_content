<h1>Beating death of McKees Rocks man, 73, leads to life sentence for killer</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Allegheny County judge Monday sentenced a Stowe man to life without parole in connection with the 2016 beating death of a 73-year-old man.</p>
<p>Police said that on June 1, 2016, Branden A. Frazier, 28, fatally beat Benito Nicoletti in the victim’s McKees Rocks home and then stole his rented Chrysler 300.</p>
<p>On Oct. 7, a jury found Frazier guilty of first-degree murder as well as burglary, receiving stolen property and theft.</p>
<p>Frazier appeared before Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Kevin G. Sasinoski, who&nbsp;sentenced him to an additional 10 to 21 years in prison in connection with the other charges.</p>
<p>Marvin Leibowitz, Frazier’s lawyer, said he remains hopeful that the outcome will change on appeal.</p>
<p>“I am a great believer in the jury system, but I just believe that the jury got it wrong in convicting him of first-degree murder,” Mr. Leibowitz said.</p>
