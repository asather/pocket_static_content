<h1>The Pirates' best and worst 1st-round picks since the turn of the century</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In their 20 drafts since the turn of the century, the Pirates have taken some true gems and embarrassing duds with their 24 first-round selections. Here’s a look back at their best and worst as they prepare to pick two players in the first round of the 2020 draft, which begins Wednesday night.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Best</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Andrew McCutchen —</strong>&nbsp;He has the resume of a first-overall pick, and you know it well. National League MVP in 2013. Leader of a moribund franchise’s first three playoff teams in 20 years. A dazzling, Gold Glove defender in center field and, to top it off, an active force for good in his community. One couldn’t ask for more in a face of the team than the Pirates got in McCutchen, and yet 10 teams passed on him before the club snatched him up at No. 11. Former general manager Dave Littlefield’s regime produced some truly embarrassing misses that we’ll get to shortly. But give him credit for getting his most important pick right with the man they call Cutch.</p>
<p><strong>Gerrit Cole —</strong>&nbsp;Hard to feel good about this one considering he was dealt away for a pretty nominal return and has since blossomed into a perennial Cy Young-caliber starter, signed this past winter to one of the richest contracts in baseball history. Fans will be asking “what if?” questions about him for years to come. Still, he was a foundational member of a rotation that delivered three playoff bids, and his 2015 season was one of the best by a Pirate since the early 1990s: 19-8 record, a 2.60 ERA and an impressive 202 strikeouts. One could argue the Pirates could have done better with the first overall pick in 2011, but they probably could have done a lot worse, too.</p>
<p><strong>Neil Walker —</strong>&nbsp;It’s possible that his Pine-Richland roots caused his legend to grow beyond his performance at times. In terms of wins above replacement, his best season here would rank as only McCutchen’s fifth-best, even as their stars were of similar magnitude locally. That said, you won’t find many more consistently solid performers than the Pirates found in him. In each of his six full seasons with the club, he posted a WAR total of at least 1.9, according to FanGraphs. While fellow first rounders had their ups and downs as PIrates, he was always consistent. You knew what you’d get from him. And those are the types of players small-market teams need to reach the playoffs year after year as the Pirates did beginning seven years after his selection at No. 11 overall in 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Honorable mentions:</strong> Paul Maholm, Pedro Alvarez, Jameson Taillon.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Worst</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>John Van Benschoten —</strong>&nbsp;He and Bryan Bullintgton, who we’ll get to in a minute, are often remembered as twin disasters after being selected in back-to-back drafts in 2001 and 2002. Van Benschoten’s career was probably the far bigger mess from a development perspective, though. As a junior at Kent State, he led all of Division I in homers with 31. Despite that pedigree, the Pirates drafted him eighth overall to be a pitcher, and boy, was he … not. Called up as a midseason rotation replacement in 2004, he immediately struggled, posting a 6.91 ERA in six appearances. And that was as good as it got, as he posted ERAs over 10.00 across 20 appearances in 2007 and 2008 after shoulder surgery cost him all of 2005 and most of 2006. His career 9.20 ERA is second-worst in big-league history among pitchers who’ve thrown at least 80 innings. Probably should have just let him swing the bat.</p>
<p><strong>Bryan Bullington —</strong>&nbsp;His numbers are not as historically awful by comparison. He just never managed to get a toe hold in Pittsburgh despite going first overall in 2002. After a forgettable debut with the big club in 2005, he, too, was beset by shoulder issues that cost him all of 2006. Upon his return to action in 2007, he spent most of the year the minors before joining the Pirates in September and posting a lackluster 5.29 ERA in five appearances, three of them starts. The club was unimpressed and never brought him back to the majors. He floundered in the minors in 2008 until he was designated for assignment, ending his Pirates tenure with just 18.1 innings pitched. He got a few more shots at glory with Cleveland, Toronto and Kansas City, but he never stuck and ended his big-league career in 2010 with a 5.62 career ERA.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Moskos —</strong>&nbsp;Here’s a partial list of players who were available when the Pirates were on the clock at No. 4 overall in 2007: Matt Wieters, Madison Bumgarner, Jason Heyward and Devin Mesoraco. All of them went on to be All-Stars, just not for the Pirates. Instead, they selected Moskos out of Clemson to immediate derision from fans and media, as his ceiling was likely no higher than the club’s future closer. He ended up falling decidedly short of even that, pitching in just 31 games with the big club in 2011 before getting cut loose in 2012. His 2.96 ERA wasn’t awful. He just never showed the wipeout stuff you’d want to see as a staple of any bullpen, a major reason he had a losing record and ERA over 4.00 in the club’s farm system.</p>
