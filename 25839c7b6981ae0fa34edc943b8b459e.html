<h1>Upper St. Clair student’s sock drive&nbsp;collects for homeless </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When fourth grader Audrey Wetterau learned that Pittsburgh’s homeless population didn’t have access to new, clean socks, she took the initiative to do something about it.</p>
<p>Audrey, 10, attends Baker Elementary in Upper St. Clair, and started her own organization, Socks With a Mission, and held a drive at her school in February that collected more than 2,000 pairs of socks for homeless people in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“Homeless people walk miles everyday,” Audrey said. “Socks are such a basic necessity.”</p>
<p>She got the idea after attending her school’s leadership academy, led by Baker Elementary teacher Eric Wiesemann, who has his own organization that benefits homeless individuals.</p>
<p>Mr. Wiesemann, in addition to teaching kindergarten and working with the leadership academy, also runs a yo-yo club at the school. The All Wound Up Yo-Yo Club not only teaches kids how to yo-yo, but also supports local nonprofits. Mr. Wiesemann also has his own organization, Light in My City, which provides lanterns and flashlights to homeless individuals.</p>
<p>Audrey first started with a supply drive in her neighborhood during which she collected 300 pairs of men’s socks, 144 pairs of men’s underwear, 41 pairs of women’s socks and 181 packages of disposable washcloths along with hundreds of other personal care items.</p>
<p>Then Audrey decided to take her collection to the next level, after finding out socks were the No. 1 requested item at homeless shelters.</p>
<p>Months of planning went into the schoolwide sock drive at Baker Elementary, which was held over the course of a week in February. Audrey wrote a proposal to present to her principal, Patrick McClintock-Comeaux, and made flyers to hang in the school.</p>
<p>“This was totally her idea,” Mr. Wiesemann said.</p>
<p>Upon completion of her sock drive, Audrey had a chance to visit a homeless camp in Pittsburgh and meet some of the people.</p>
<p>“It was really humbling to see how grateful he was for the socks,” Audrey said.</p>
<p>Audrey’s mom, Amy Wetterau, said her daughter has inspired her.</p>
<p>“We’ve always tried to give and volunteer here and there,” she said, but Audrey took it to another level.</p>
<p>“I look at things differently now. It’s humbling to see the community support.” </p>
<p>“It’s not just about her, it’s about her inspiring others to do the right thing,” Mr. McClintock-Comeaux said of Audrey’s initiative.</p>
<p>As for the future of Socks With a Mission, Audrey said, “I just want to see where it goes.”</p>
<p>To date, Audrey and Socks With a Mission have collected more than 4,000 pairs of socks. Many of the socks have been delivered to Light of Life Rescue Mission on the North Side.</p>
