<h1>St. Paul Cathedral opens doors for Mass</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Rev. Kris Stubna started the noon Sunday Mass in a most unusual way.</p>
<p>“It’s so good to see all of you today!” he said from the altar of St. Paul Cathedral in Oakland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approximately 180 people nodded, but if they were smiling with happiness, that wasn’t apparent, for virtually all of them were wearing face masks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The doors of the vast and ornate Gothic Revival-style Roman Catholic cathedral opened Sunday for the first time in months after the coronavirus pandemic caused shutdowns and quarantines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before starting the Mass, the pastor of St. Paul Cathedral parish explained a number of changes. “Since this is all relatively new to you, masks are required. That’s not an option. If you want to be in the cathedral, you have to wear a mask.”</p>
<p>A few people sitting in the back of the cathedral pulled masks from pockets and purses and put them on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are looking for more volunteers to clean and sanitize after each Mass,” Father Stubna said.&nbsp;“We are glad to have all of you here. Do your part to keep the cathedral clean.”</p>
<p>No collection baskets were passed through the congregation. There were no hymn books in the pews and there would be only two communion stations, Father Stubna said. Communion would be moved to the end of the Mass, with people receiving the hosts in their cupped hands and then exiting the cathedral.</p>
<p>There was no choir — just a cantor who sang while Ken Danchik played the organ with over 5,000 pipes that were installed in 1968.</p>
<p>The scent of incense filled the air, which was a touch lacking from the virtual Masses that have been broadcast on television and Facebook.</p>
<p>Dozens of stained-glass windows cast jewel-like light on the 180 people who came to worship Sunday. Green tape was strung on most of the wooden pews, marking them as off limits. People were allowed in every third pew, and social distancing was required except for families who live together.</p>
<p>The vacant pews were a stark contrast to the usual Mass that ushers said can attract more than 2,000 people, counting those who stand in the aisles after the pews fill up.</p>
<p>People had to go to <a href="http://www.ghocatholics.com" target="_blank">www.ghocatholics.com</a>&nbsp;or call the parish office at 412-621-4951 to register in advance for the Sunday Masses at 6:30 a.m., 10 a.m. and noon. Father Stubna said each of the services had the 180 maximum people.&nbsp;The website also has his updates for scheduled Mass in the future.</p>
<p>“People are thrilled to be back,” Father Stubna said in a brief interview prior to the noon Mass.&nbsp;“We have at least 15 volunteers cleaning after each Mass, many of them kids from the parish.”</p>
<p>Dominic and ChunLim Abbott traveled from Fox Chapel to attend the noon Mass. Sunday was&nbsp;“a happy day,” Mrs. Abbott said. They usually attend Mass at the cathedral every Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>Shelly Andrews traveled from Munhall because she said the cathedral&nbsp;“is a special, beautiful jewel of the city. I love the cathedral and the music.”</p>
<p>Though she said she is a Protestant, Ms. Andrews has been coming to Mass at St. Paul Cathedral for 30 years for&nbsp;“the reverence of the Catholic service. I go to Protestant services, too.”</p>
<p>Beginning June 20, a maximum of 72 people will be able to attend the 4 p.m. Saturday Mass at Saint Rosalia in Greenfield. The St. Paul Cathedral Parish is a merger of the cathedral and Saint Regis, St. Rosalia and Saint Stephen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At this time, individuals are only permitted to register for one Sunday Mass a month. We want to give as many people as possible an opportunity to attend.” Father Stubna’s message on the website says. “Once we assess the demand and numbers of people registering for these Masses, we might be able to make some changes.”</p>
