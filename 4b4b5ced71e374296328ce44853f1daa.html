<h1>Mayor Peduto seeks recommendation on fate of Columbus statue in Schenley Park</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto has asked the Pittsburgh Art Commission to begin the public reviewing process to determine the future of the Christopher Columbus statue in Schenley Park.</p>
<p>The commission plans to discuss the issue at a virtual hearing scheduled for 2 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
<p>The statue was vandalized in 2010, 2017 and again in June and July — part of nationwide protests against monuments honoring the Italian explorer, whose history includes the enslavement of indigenous people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the incident in June, an online petition was created calling for the statue’s removal.</p>
<p>In 2018, Mr. Peduto also called upon the Art Commission for advice in handling the Stephen Foster monument in Oakland, which ultimately was removed from the park.</p>
<p>“Public art is an essential element of community identity, public history, and evolving culture. It reflects and reveals who we are and what our communities mean to us,” Mr. Peduto said in a news release on Tuesday. “As they did with the Stephen Foster Memorial, I know that the Art Commission will take this opportunity to thoughtfully lead the City through this evaluation with the backdrop that the public process is very important.”</p>
<p>There will be a period of time for the public to submit their opinions and recommendations to the commission, and a special hearing portion of the review process that will allow those interested to speak in front of the commission on what they think should be done with the statue.</p>
<p>Once the review process is finished, Mr. Peduto has requested a final report, which would include public comments and a recommendation from the Art Commission.</p>
<p>The Columbus statue, owned by the city and sculpted by Frank Vittor, has been in Schenley Park since 1958.</p>
