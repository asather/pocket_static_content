<h1>Pat McAfee finally learns how Troy Polamalu ruined his chance to score a touchdown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NFL punters generally aren’t known for scoring very many touchdowns during their careers. So when the rare opportunity arises for them to carry the ball into the end zone, they probably tend to remember it forever, whether the play was successful or not.</p>
<p>That’s certainly the case for Pat McAfee, a retired punter and Pittsburgh native, who was vividly able to recall the time in 2014 when <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/01/Troy-Polamalu-joins-Steelers-greats-Pro-Football-Hall-of-Fame/stories/202002010049" target="_blank">newly minted Hall of Famer</a> Troy Polamalu ruined what he believed to be the perfect chance for him to carry a football across the goal line — in front of his hometown crowd no less.</p>
<p>McAfee — who <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/McAfPa44.htm" target="_blank">finished his career</a> with zero touchdowns — first told the story as a media personality in 2017, going into painstaking detail on the play in question. You can listen to the <a href="https://twitter.com/PatMcAfeeShow/status/925686629188038657" target="_blank">full audio here</a>, but be warned that it’s extremely NSFW, as McAfee gets passionate discussing Polamalu “ruining his life.”</p>
<p>The play occurred when McAfee’s Colts were playing the Steelers at Heinz Field. Indianapolis had a fake field goal play that was allegedly “a 100-percenter” against Pittsburgh, specifically. The Colts were so confident in its success that they didn’t even install a built-in way to check out of it, according to McAfee.</p>
<p>For the play to work, the ball had to be inside the seven-yard line on the left hash mark. The Colts realized through watching tape that the Steelers tended to leave the C-Gap open in that situation, and the left side of the field would be wide open on a fake for an easy touchdown.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, the Colts found themselves in the exact situation for that play to work in front of McAfee’s hometown fans. On fourth and goal, he went out to capture a moment of glory that many punters and kickers go their entire careers without earning.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for Polamalu to crush his hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>“Not a once has he ever gone to this side of the field over to the left and stood right in the C-Gap,” McAfee explained. “He lined up exactly where he had lined up in film 100 percent of the time and then as soon as I got to like the second cadence, right before set, he just bounced his little ass right to the C-Gap.”</p>
<p>McAfee had to yell “we are kicking this!” at the top of his lungs for the Colts to pivot to kicking a normal field goal, which they did. After the play, Indianapolis coach Chuck Pagano asked McAfee why he changed the play, to which he explained that Polamalu blew it up before they could even attempt it.</p>
<p>“And he goes, ‘OK, sounds good,’” McAfee said. “Good call then.”</p>
<p>Flash forward to Friday, and McAfee finally got an explanation from Polamalu himself about how he was able to figure out what the Colts were up to on that particular play. He learned this information in real time with former Steelers cornerback Ike Taylor.</p>
<p>Polamalu said that the Steelers just happened to try a different formation than usual on that play — he tapped into his “inner Peter Parker” and “Spidey sense” to shake things up right then, Polamalu says in the video — but McAfee’s jubilation at potentially scoring a touchdown also tipped him off to the Colts’ plan.</p>
<p>“To be very honest, I could tell by Pat’s energy and the way he came off the sideline that he was excited,” Polamalu said. “He showed his hand. He has a lot of tells.”</p>
<p>McAfee reacted like a man whose moment in the spotlight was stolen by a player with some of the most advanced football instincts on Earth. “Now that I know it was him and Jesus all along, we were in a bad spot,” McAfee admitted.</p>
<p>Taylor brought it home, summing up why his former teammate was a first-ballot Hall of Famer.</p>
<p>“That’s that gift,” he said. “He’s different, man. He’s special.”</p>
