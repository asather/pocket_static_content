<h1>Four Democrats vying for House 36 nomination cite their professional experience</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>All four candidates vying for the Democratic nomination in the state House district stretching from the city to the South Hills say they’ve got the professional experience to take over for outgoing 13-term Rep. Harry Readshaw.</p>
<p>Only one of them will win next Tuesday, but Jessica Benham, Heather Kass, Mark Johnson and Ed Moeller insist they’re the candidate —&nbsp;the only one in the crowded field —&nbsp;who won’t have to navigate a learning curve when they get to Harrisburg.</p>
<p>Ms. Benham says her background as a union organizer and health care advocate —&nbsp;through a nonprofit she co-founded that serves adults on the autism spectrum —&nbsp;has given her experience writing grants and helping connect constituents with resources.</p>
<p>Ms. Kass, a self-described “go-getter,” says she’s not a career politician, has been in the health care field for years and will know how to improve patients’ lives from Harrisburg, in particular.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson, who’s worked as a counsel in the U.S. House and as an attorney in employment discrimination matters, says he’s seen firsthand how the legislative process works, and that he can write legislation himself —&nbsp;without lobbyist influence —&nbsp;on issues that unite people.</p>
<p>And Mr. Moeller, the only one who has held elected office, says his time on Baldwin’s council and district school board put him face-to-face with state legislators, including the outgoing Mr. Readshaw, and allowed him to test out his affinity for working across the aisle.</p>

<p>The winner of the primary will face Republican AJ Doyle in the general election. The 36th district includes Carrick, South Side and Mount Washington within city limits, and Brentwood, Mount Oliver and part of Baldwin.</p>
<p>The co-founder of the Pittsburgh Center for Autistic Advocacy, Ms. Benham said she’s advocated for policies on the state and local level, and recalled her role in getting Paul’s Law passed in 2017. The law protected people with disabilities from discrimination during the organ transplant process.</p>
<p>What separates her from the field, Ms. Benham said, is that she’s outlined specific plans to voters.</p>
<p>“That is one of the clearest differences between myself and my opponents,” Ms. Benham said.&nbsp;“Because of the work I’ve already done, I’ve already worked on policy issues at the state level. I’m prepared for when the unexpected happens because I’m going to be ready with a plan.”</p>
<p>Ms. Benham, who would be the first autistic woman to serve in the state legislature, as well as the first LGBTQ+ female legislator, said she wants to lay the groundwork for those who follow her “so we’re no longer having conversations about if people like me have the ability to lead.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kass said she wants to bring back funding for health care patients, victims of violent crime and children, among others. She said she’d work to secure funds so programs are available “for everybody” —&nbsp;toward school safety, for example.</p>
<p>Ms. Kass said she wants to take care of the less fortunate, and that she’d work&nbsp;“to get programs in place” for neighborhoods like Mount Oliver, which have higher rates of poverty.</p>
<p>For now, she said stakeholders need to do more to help small businesses in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“Our corporations are great, yes, but our mom-and-pop shops are what keep America running,” Ms. Kass said. “I know a lot of constituents in the area losing their businesses.”</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson, who said he sees openings to make progress on issues that unite people, pointed to criminal justice reform as a priority. He said he supports legalizing marijuana, which he thinks will have bipartisan support next year when the legislature realizes “we’re going to need the money” to revamp a post-pandemic economy.</p>
<p>The country, Mr. Johnson said, faces issues of critical importance, too, like global warming — which demand immediate action. COVID-19 has exposed some of those issues, too, he added.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/politically-inclined-podcast/" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/10/politically-inclined-politics-podcast-banner-story-insert" alt="Click to listen"> </a></p>
<p>“COVID has helped people put into perspective the systemic issues we’ve had for a long time,” Mr. Johnson said. “People are more keen and aware that everyone should health care. These front-line workers that Amazon and Walmart keep running ads thanking? Maybe they need good wages.”</p>
<p>Mr. Moeller said he is a moderate Democrat willing to work with others, a skill he learned on council when he was — at some points — in the minority.</p>
<p>“I’m not there to slam the table and say,&nbsp;‘We’re going to do this and do it my way,’” Mr. Moeller said.</p>
<p>Mr. Moeller said success in Harrisburg comes from working together. An issue he’d like to make progress on, he said, is finding&nbsp;a way to alleviate flooding and landslides in the district.</p>
