<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The YMCA in Greensburg has been temporarily closed because of COVID-19 exposure.</p>
<p>YMCA leadership was notified by state health officials late Friday afternoon that someone associated with the summer camp was confirmed positive with the virus, according to interim CEO Suzanne Printz.</p>
<p>The individual was last on site and in contact with campers on Wednesday, she said.</p>
<p>“Upon receiving notification, all campers were moved outside while YMCA staff began executing cleaning and sanitization protocols indoors,” Ms. Printz said in a statement. “Under the direction of local health officials and following CDC guidelines, the process will continue until we are confident our facilities are safe for all to return,” she said.</p>
<p>According to the YMCA’s website, the facility will remain closed at least through Monday. An update on the expected opening will be posted by noon Monday, the site said.</p>
