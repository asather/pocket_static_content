<h1>Demonstrators in Downtown protest Wolf's stay-at-home and business shutdown orders</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Carrying handcrafted signs, waving flags and honking horns, more than 100 protesters gathered Monday in front of the City-County Building in Downtown to voice their discontent with Gov. Tom Wolf’s business closures and stay-at-home orders in the wake of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Constitution has been trampled on and we’re losing our civil liberties,” said Kevin Stock, a protester from Cambria County who was with his wife.&nbsp;“People are losing their jobs, people are losing their livelihoods over this.”</p>
<p>All called on Mr. Wolf to reverse the orders. The same afternoon, however, Mr. Wolf announced that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/04/20/Pennsylvania-Tom-Wolf-extends-stay-at-home-order-May-8-curbside-liquor-pick-up/stories/202004200096" target="_blank">he was extending the stay-at-home order to May 8</a>.</p>
<p>At the Downtown rally, which was mirrored by a larger demonstration at the state Capitol building in Harrisburg, most expressed concern over the economic impact of the shutdowns, but some called the closures illegal on constitutional grounds. Others indicated skepticism of public health experts and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“I don’t trust them,” said Patricia Cerda of Port Vue.&nbsp;“I don’t trust (infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony) Fauci; I think he wants to be a showboat ... there’s been many flus and many epidemics.”</p>
<p>The crowd broke out into occasional chants of&nbsp;“USA! USA!” as dozens of cars and trucks drove by, honking their horns, holding signs that read “Don’t Tread on Me” and “Make America Great Again,” and waving American flags.</p>
<p>Roughly a dozen armed protesters — members of the&nbsp;“Iron City Citizens Response Unit” — carried semi-automatic weapons.</p>
<p>Many of the protesters did not wear masks per CDC and state guidelines, and virtually none kept to the CDC-recommended six feet of distance from others — even as they called on businesses to reopen&nbsp;“within CDC guidelines.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gathering comes as anti-shutdown protests have converged on capitals across the nation, with Harrisburg also seeing protests in front of the state capitol today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If you come to Harrisburg and you’re not practicing social distancing, then you are putting all of yourselves at risk,” Pennsylvania health secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said on Thursday. “So if a gathering like that happens and they’re not practicing social distancing … then they will be more at risk for contracting the dangerous virus.”</p>
<p>Danny DeVito, 45, a Republican candidate for state representative in the 45th District, which includes Kennedy and Robinson, also attended the protest and gave a brief speech calling on Mr. Wolf to reopen the state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Why the hell is [Anita Kulik, the current district representative] voting to reopen on a Philadelphia timeline instead of a Pittsburgh timeline?” Mr. DeVito asked over the din of car horns.&nbsp;“It’s time we reopen. Gov. Wolf is arrogant, and Gov. Wolf is incompetent.”</p>
