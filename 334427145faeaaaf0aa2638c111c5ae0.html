<h1>Pirates unaffected by COVID-19 spike in Florida</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While novel coronavirus cases have spiked in Florida and have impacted other major league teams’ spring training facilities, the Pirates have not experienced anything of the sort.</p>
<p>According to a team spokesman, they have not had any player, coach or staff member test positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Pirates had already ceased all baseball operations at Pirate City in Bradenton, Fla. for “sometime now” and have had “limited” operations with less than a handful of major league players utilizing the facilities.</p>
<p>“All follow appropriate entry protocols and social distancing guidelines, and the facility is cleaned multiple times throughout the day,” Pirates vice president of communications and broadcasting Brian Warecki said.</p>
<p>About an hour away, however, the Phillies announced Friday that five players have tested positive for COVID-19 at the team’s spring camp in Clearwater, Fla., prompting the club to indefinitely close the complex.&nbsp;The team also said that three staff members at the camp have tested positive. The club didn’t identify any of those affected.</p>
<p>The announcement came while Major League Baseball owners and players try to negotiate a deal to begin the season amid the coronavirus pandemic, including health protocols. Some players had been recently been working out at spring training sites while practicing social distancing.</p>
<p>The Pirates do have 10 minor league players who have remained in Bradenton, unable to return home because of travel restrictions.&nbsp;Their focus, Warecki said, has shifted toward preparing for spring training 2.0 in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The Toronto Blue Jays have also closed their spring training facilities amid the COVID-19 scare.</p>
