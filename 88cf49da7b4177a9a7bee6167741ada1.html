<h1>Long-delayed Kenmawr Bridge project in Rankin and Swissvale to begin</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you can image the chaos that would be created by a family estate left to 12 children with no last will and testament, you’ll understand how it has taken more than 20 years to begin replacing the Kenmawr Bridge that joins Rankin and Swissvale.</p>
<p>Work on the two-year, $12.5 million project on South Braddock Avenue begins Monday with utility relocation and property demolition, and eventually will include construction of a temporary bridge to allow crews to raise the height of the new structure by about four feet. The bridge goes over Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks and the railroad wants to run double-stacked freight cars there.</p>

<p>“I’m really happy to get this one underway,” said Cheryl Moon-Sirianni, district executive for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.&nbsp;“It is a very difficult site to work in and design wasn’t easy.”</p>
<p>Four factors have made this such a challenging project:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Although the existing two-lane bridge is only 73 feet long, it is jammed into a narrow corridor with railroad tracks and the end of the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway underneath and houses, small businesses and abandoned buildings on each end and both sides. It links to the Parkway East on the Swissvale end, and the Rankin Bridge and Kennywood Park on the Rankin side.</p>
<p>• Ownership and responsibility for upkeep has been murky and fragmented at best. The railroad has been responsible for the substructure and superstructure, Rankin and Swissvale own the approaches on each end and Allegheny County is responsible for the surface. Over the years, the state Public Utility Commission has had to adjudicate disputes about who’s responsible for what to keep the span open.</p>
<p>Ms. Moon-Sirianni said state Sen. Jay Costa, D-Forest Hills, played a major role in brokering the deal to move this project forward. PennDOT will oversee the project that will be paid for with 80% federal funding, 10% from the state and contributions from the railroad ($1 million) and Port Authority ($1.46 million to allow for a potential busway extension).</p>
<p>When the project is finished, Allegheny County will own and maintain the structure.</p>
<p>• The new bridge will be 122 feet long, requiring two spans instead of one. That will allow room under the bridge and beside the railroad tracks in case Port Authority ever moves ahead with a $549 million proposal to extend the East Busway to East Pittsburgh. Raising the height four feet also will mean rebuilding the approaches on each side of the bridge.</p>
<p>• To maintain traffic, contractor Golden Triangle Construction will build a temporary bridge on the Hawkins Village side. In September 2021, after Kennywood closes for the season, the road will be closed for 75 days for the approach work and to install a left turning lane from South Braddock Avenue to Woodstock Avenue, which was requested by Swissvale.</p>
<p>“It’s such a vital link to the Parkway East, you have to maintain traffic,” Ms. Moon-Sirianni said.</p>
<p>In all, PennDOT acquired 35 parcels for the project, including three residences and one business, and eight buildings will be demolished. The Allegheny County Housing Authority recently announced it will demolish nearby Hawkins Village, but Ms. Moon-Sirianni said the two projects aren’t related.</p>
<p>The existing bridge has a 12-ton weight limit that prohibits trucks and buses from using it and the sidewalks have been closed since 2013.&nbsp;The new bridge will have extra-wide, 14-foot lanes in each direction and sidewalks on both sides.</p>
<p>In addition to the possible busway extension, spokesman Adam Brandolph said Port Authority wants the new bridge because it has detoured four bus routes since 2013 due to the weight limits on the bridge. The detours cause increased cost and add 10 to 15 minutes to each route.</p>
<p>“This will allow us more direct access to those communities so we don’t have to go such a roundabout route,” Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
