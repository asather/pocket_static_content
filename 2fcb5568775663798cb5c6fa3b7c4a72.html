<h1>Pence reaffirms administration's support of law enforcement in Greensburg speech</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In a half-hour speech to supporters of President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign in Greensburg on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence reaffirmed the White House’s support of law enforcement and framed November’s election as a choice between “freedom and opportunity” and “socialism and decline.”</p>
<p>On an outdoor stage at the town’s police department headquarters, Mr. Pence routinely used the phrase “back the blue” to describe the administration’s commitment to maintaining law and order, which has become a key facet of Mr. Trump’s campaign against former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Echoing arguments that the campaign has blasted out on the airwaves in recent months, Mr. Pence harangued leading Democratic politicians for espousing what he considers to be anti-police rhetoric and policy proposals.</p>
<p>“I want to assure you: your president knows, this vice-president knows and the overwhelming majority of the American people know that the men and women of law enforcement are the best people in this country,” Mr. Pence said.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement isn’t the problem. Law enforcement is the solution,” the vice president added.</p>
<p>Mr. Pence painted a picture of Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, as a figurehead for a party that’s caving into its most radical members. Joe Biden’s America, Mr. Pence insisted, would be one where lawlessness reigns free, police department budgets are trimmed and “you won’t be safe.”</p>
<p>“The truth is, history teaches that weakness arouses evil, and as we see major cities across the country buying into the agenda of the radical left, we’re seeing crime rise across America,” Mr. Pence claimed, saying it’s “got to stop” and that “we must restore law and order to the streets of our community for every American of every race and creed and color.”</p>
<p>Mr. Pence said Mr. Biden supports cutting funding to law enforcement, telling the crowd, “We’re not going to defund the police. Not now. Not ever.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden has never called for completely defunding the police. In a July interview that was shared thousands of times on social media — including by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany — Mr. Biden agreed with an activist that some funding for police should be redirected into other programs, like mental health counseling, according to reporting in the Associated Press.</p>
<p>“We don’t have to defund the police departments, we have to make sure they meet minimum basic standards of decency,” Mr. Biden said July 8, according to the AP.</p>
<p>Mr. Pence also pinned Mr. Biden as saying that well-armed police become the “enemy” when confronting lawlessness.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden remarked recently that police forces don’t need military equipment, and that when they bring an “up-armored Humvee” into a neighborhood, “It’s like the military invading. They don’t know anybody. They become the enemy. They’re supposed to be protecting these people.”</p>
<p>Before Mr. Pence arrived in Western Pennsylvania, Mr. Biden’s campaign released a statement saying the last thing Pennsylvanians need is an unnecessary “photo-op” from a Trump administration official while the region continues to struggle with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Residents of the state need a president who will “provide the leadership and trust that they deserve” instead of more “broken promises” from the current administration, said Kate Bedingfield, Mr. Biden’s deputy campaign manager.</p>
<p>In his speech, Mr. Pence praised the president for building a strong economy before the pandemic, creating more than 7 million jobs and “[pouring] a foundation on which the economy of Pennsylvania and America is already coming back.”</p>

<p>If Mr. Biden were president, America would be on different path, Mr. Pence said. Mr. Biden would raise taxes by $4 trillion, the vice president said —&nbsp;a figure that appears to come from a Tax Policy Center analysis earlier this year, in which the nonpartisan group said the candidate’s tax plan would raise that amount partly from increased tax rates on high-income households and businesses, according to news reports.</p>
<p>Mr. Pence warned the audience that cities are buying into partisan rhetoric about the police and stepping away from their support of law enforcement. He pointed to Minneapolis moving toward dismantling its police department, and to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio cutting the NYPD’s budget by $1 billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cities are struggling with rising crime rates, Mr. Pence said, which he deemed a preview of Biden’s agenda. What’s at stake in the election, Mr. Pence said, is “the peace of mind that you, your family and your children have every right to enjoy as citizens of the greatest nation on Earth.”</p>
<p>“Joe Biden and the radical left say we have to choose between supporting our police or supporting all the families of our communities,” Mr. Pence said. “Well, the American people know we don’t need to choose between supporting law enforcement or supporting our African American neighbors. We can do both. We have done both and we will keep doing both for four more years.”</p>
