<h1> Biden sketches out his would-be administration </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Joe Biden has committed to choosing a woman as his running mate. He’s vowed to nominate an African American woman to the Supreme Court. And now, he’s toying with the idea of creating new Cabinet posts and possibly even naming potential agency secretaries before the election.</p>
<p>The presumptive Democratic nominee is sketching out an increasingly detailed portrait of the kinds of people he would surround himself with if he became president. At a moment when the COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the country’s faith in government and frequently rendered Mr. Biden’s candidacy a lonely pursuit, his campaign is emphasizing what would happen after the election — were he to win — more so than what he will do in the nearly seven months of campaigning before the November vote.</p>
<p>He is also making his pitch as much about his allies as about him, presenting himself as the conductor of an orchestra whose individual players might appeal to the disparate elements of a party Mr. Biden is seeking to unify.</p>
<p>His moves reflect a campaign trying to project know-how and preparedness, qualities it hopes will contrast in the minds of many voters with President Donald Trump, whom Mr. Biden is casting as chaotic and woefully unreliable in moments of crisis.</p>
<p>Voters “need reassurance delivered in specific information,” said Henry Muñoz, a former Democratic National Committee finance chairman and an informal Biden adviser. “The best form of leadership is a person who is willing to surround themselves with diverse, strong voices.”</p>
<p>The strategy is also driven by the practical problem of mounting a campaign in the era of COVID-19. When the former vice president hits the trail these days, it means beaming into people’s living rooms from his makeshift basement TV studio, piping into their headphones with his new podcast and schmoozing with donors on Zoom, all from a safe social distance that has isolated him from the country he wants to lead.</p>
<p>Some Democrats worry about Mr. Biden being eclipsed by Mr. Trump, whose White House pandemic briefings are carried live and whose hourly battles with political rivals have been splashed across newspaper front pages.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s slow rollout of a growing army of high-wattage surrogates offers the potential, at least, of breaking through the din.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult because he’s not a public official now, and he’s in this period of time when he’s a candidate when we’re in the middle of a worldwide pandemic,” said Sen. Bob Casey Jr., D-Pa., a close Biden ally who said the “physical limitations” of campaigning from home also present a challenge.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, speaking at a virtual fundraiser, said Thursday that he has started constructing a presidential transition team, a process he said has been underway for several weeks.</p>
<p>Discussions are in progress about the prospect of elevating some White House offices to Cabinet-level positions, Mr. Biden said. Among those under consideration: the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the global health security pandemic office, and a separate climate change operation that “goes beyond the EPA,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden said he “would consider announcing some Cabinet members before the election,” a move that would be highly unusual, but he clarified that he hasn’t “made that commitment” yet. Still, he signaled that he has a good idea of who would fill the positions.</p>
