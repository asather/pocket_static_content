<h1>Joe Starkey's mailbag: Should high school basketball have a mandatory shot clock?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lucius Allen and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p>Actually, we begin today with our intergalactically popular Twitter Poll. I conducted an eight-hour poll, drawing 1,170 responses to the following question: Should high school basketball have a (nationally sanctioned) shot clock?</p>
<p>Yes: 80.4%</p>
<p>No: 19.6%</p>
<p>What we learned: That people are smart (sometimes). Shot clocks are used everywhere else in basketball, so why shouldn’t high schools use one?</p>
<p>The question was posed in the wake of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/05/11/shot-clock-high-school-basketball-WPIAL-PIAA-NFHS-national-federation/stories/202005110115" target="_blank">Mike White’s story in the Post-Gazette</a>, detailing how the “basketball rules committee of the National Federation of State High School Associations recently voted down a proposal that would establish a 35-second shot clock for boys and girls basketball around the country.”</p>
<p>White added, “The rules committee also turned down a proposal to allow state organizations, such as the PIAA, to adopt a shot clock if they wanted. The national federation establishes rules for all high school sports.”</p>
<p>Turns out states can institute a shot clock if they desire — and nine states have — but “the consequence of not following the NFHS rules is that the state association is not permitted to have membership on the NFHS rules committee.”</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I could live with that “punishment,” but the PIAA will follow the national recommendation.</p>
<p>This kicked off quite the Twitter debate, featuring former Post-Gazette columnist Bob Smizik and longtime Sporting News writer Mike DeCourcy …</p>
<p>Smizik: “I understand the desire of some for a shot clock in high school basketball. But it’s not like the sport is careening off some sort of cliff and will disappear if the shot clock is not instituted. Will high school basketball be better with the shot clock? Maybe. Maybe not.”</p>
<p>DeCourcy: “Definitely. American basketball at that age is the only venue in the world playing without a clock. It’s ridiculous US should be behind anyone in the American game”</p>
<p>In popped a man named Steven Roland Smith: “How about something crazy like playing defense. #5secondrule”</p>
<p>DeCourcy came right back down the court and launched a shot (well before the 35-second clock expired, of course): “How about something crazy like playing basketball? Basketball has a clock now. Maybe it didn’t in 1952. That’s over.”</p>
<p>White cites expenses as a major reason why schools are against the shot clock — and I must confess, I don’t know how much even a rudimentary shot clock would cost. But I’m in agreement with DeCourcy: Basketball has become a shot-clock sport. High schools, if at all possible, should follow suit.</p>
<p>I’ve seen games — not many, but some — where coaches freeze the ball. It’s ludicrous and should never be allowed to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Halvy Buckets, @halvybuckets:</strong> If you had the power to eliminate one professional sports team and its history, which team would it be and why the Dallas Cowboys?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> It wouldn’t be the Cowboys, much as I hated them when I was a child, Dr. Buckets. They have a rich history. Beating them meant something. Their Super Bowls against the Steelers vaulted the Steelers to “Team of the ’70s” status.</p>
<p>I’m thinking it would be the Florida Panthers. That way, we could wipe out the horrible memory of that team holding, hooking and tackling their way past the Penguins in the 1996 Eastern Conference final. We could wipe out any memory of rats littering the ice.</p>
<p>And really, what else have the Panthers done? Any memory of them would fade quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Stu Ohler, @s_ohler:</strong> Once the whole COVID-19 situation has passed, and fans are back in the stands, how do you think sports will permanently change? I don’t foresee things going completely back to normal, but I also can’t immediately identify what I think will be different.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> In terms of the fan experience, I could see something like what Taiwan was planning for baseball games, Stu, and that would be mandatory temperature checks outside stadiums. It would simply become part of the routine, just as increased security became part of the routine after 9/11.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Reese, @BuStA607:</strong> Any chance this pandemic forces MLB to have a salary cap next year to help smaller market teams who suffer losses stay competitive?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> None, Bobby. The players’ union once sacrificed a World Series in its effort to avoid salary cap. It is fighting the owners’ initial resume-play proposal even as we speak because it too closely resembles a cap.</p>
<p>Like it or not, baseball will not have a cap anytime soon. Unlike their counterparts in the other major sports, baseball players have proven their resolve in this matter.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Covington, @GreenShelMagic:</strong> Though I want sports to return in any capacity, I think people are underestimating how odd the atmosphere will be if there are no fans. The games will feel exhibition-ish. Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Almost unimaginable, Mr. Covington, but I also believe it will vary based on the sport. Baseball lends itself more than any other to no fans. That became clear watching the KBO. I think we’ll get used to that pretty quickly, should it happen.</p>
<p>Besides — and this isn’t meant as a joke — around here we’re fairly used to watching baseball games with hardly any fans, right?</p>
<p>Football, basketball and hockey would be waaaaay different. I think you would see different camera angles employed to minimize the glaring truth of fanless venues, but what about the noise?</p>
<p>What is playoff hockey without the noise?</p>
<p>That being said, I wonder if we might get used to it. I’d like to find out, if that’s the only option.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Mackowiak, @MattMackowiak:</strong> Are the Steelers capable of following the Titans’ defensive playbook to stopping [Lamar Jackson] and the Ravens?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Listen, Mack: The Steelers did pretty well on their own. Do you not recall? They held Lamar Jackson to a 54.3 passer rating and picked off three of his passes. He rushed for 70 yards on 14 carries but was largely ineffective.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, Mason Rudolph played just as well before Rudolph was knocked out of the game. Mike Tomlin was right when he said the Steelers needed about a quarter to adjust to Jackson’s game speed. Once they did, they stifled him. And they likely would have won if not for JuJu’s fumble.</p>
<p>In other words, they don’t need any help on how to contain LJ. They did just fine the only time they played him.</p>
<p><strong>MFH, @FakeHoltzy22:</strong> (1.) Are you looking forward to NASCAR being back? (2.) Who do you think will win Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I added the numbers to your question to make my answer clearer, Mr. Fake. Here goes. …</p>
<p>1. No.</p>
<p>2. Who’s playing?</p>
