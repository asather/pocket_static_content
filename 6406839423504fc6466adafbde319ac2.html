<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Las Palmas Mexican grocery and taco stand in Brookline was hit with a consumer alert by health inspectors on June 9 for multiple food safety violations.</p>
<p>The inspection by the Allegheny County Health Department was prompted by a complaint.</p>
<p>Problems included moldy food, insufficient refrigeration, food being held at unsafe temperatures, unsafe cooling procedures and lack of a certified food safety manager.</p>
<p>“Manager unaware of hot holding temperatures, cold holding temperatures and cooling practices,” according to the inspection report.</p>
<p>The alert was removed on June 12 after most of the violations were fixed.</p>
<p>On June 4, a Stuff’d food truck in Lawrenceville was shut down for operating without a health permit and for failure to submit plans for approval before opening.</p>
<p>The truck also was cited for unlabeled chemical bottles and for lack of a certified food protection manager.</p>
