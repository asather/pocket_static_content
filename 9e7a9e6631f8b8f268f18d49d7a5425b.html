<h1>Elizabeth Forward shuts out South Park with a familiar face on the sideline</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>South Park teacher and former assistant football coach Mike Collodi is a huge Eagles fan 51 weeks out of the year. This week was that other week.</p>
<p>Collodi happens to be Elizabeth Forward’s head football coach. In a showdown of Class 3A Interstate Conference unbeatens, the Warriors beat down the Eagles and scored a 35-0 mercy-rule victory Friday night.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of the football players in my class and they are great,” Collodi said. “I told them, ‘I root for you every other week but this week.’ They all tell me good luck and I tell them good luck. [South Park] coach [Marty] Rieck and myself are good friends and a lot of those guys I coached with. It’s a good rivalry to have.”</p>
<p>Dual-threat quarterback Evan Lewis led the charge and had a hand in all five touchdowns for the Warriors. Elizabeth Forward raced to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, led 21-0 by halftime and rode into the fourth quarter with a 35-0 advantage to go with a running clock.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Forward (3-0) has posted two shutouts and outscored opponents 122-6.</p>
<p>Lewis carried the ball 10 times for 175 yards and three scores. He also completed 4-of-8 passes for 75 yards and two more touchdowns.</p>
<p>“Evan had a great game,” Collodi said. “He made the correct reads and we put a couple wrinkles in this week that we didn’t show on film that really panned out. Up front, anytime your quarterback rushes for 175 yards, the guys in front of him are doing a heck of a job.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth Forward outgained South Park (3-1) in total yards, 357-130. That’s a testament to the offense, as well as a tough-to-crack defense. The defensive line routinely had Eagles quarterback Harper Conroy on the move, as he went 8 of 15 for 69 yards without a touchdown or an interception.</p>
<p>“We really harp on being physical upfront,” Collodi said. “Their quarterback is a heck of player. You have to contain him because he can run. We wanted to get after him and make him feel uncomfortable and keep him contained.”</p>
<p>Conroy was seen limping along the sidelines in the second half for the banged-up Eagles, who were without leading scorer. Nate May had five touchdowns in the first three games. Rieck said May tore his ACL last week and is done for the year.</p>
<p>With May sidelined, the game plan was to feature more of Conroy; however, the Warriors had other ideas.</p>
<p>“We wanted to set Harper loose, but they found a way to answer, so our hats are off to them in that regard,” Rieck said.</p>
<p>Lewis started the scoring with a 68-yard run in the first quarter. Then he found Zachary Boyd on a 21-yard pass play to give the Warriors a quick 14-0 in the first.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Lewis again found daylight on a carry as he turned up the right hashmarks and outran the defense for 39 yards to the end zone.</p>
<p>After the break, Lewis added a 13-yard run and then found Chase Whatton from 16 yards out.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter was played with a running clock and mostly substitutes for both teams. Prior to that, Elizabeth Forward made a statement that it is one of the best squads in Class 3A. With Lewis leading a cast of playmakers to go with a stout defense, the Warriors are well-balanced and riding high.</p>
<p>“If someone wants to try take out one of our best players, I think we can answer because we have a ton of great players,” Collodi said. “This is the deepest team I think I’ve had since I’ve been here. There’s skill everywhere, there’s guys that can run and catch and are physical.”</p>
