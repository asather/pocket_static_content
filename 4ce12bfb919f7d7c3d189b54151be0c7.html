<p>WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo repeatedly clashed Friday with Democratic lawmakers who criticized him for taking weeks to appear before Congress following the killing of Iran’s top military commander and then truncating his time on Capitol Hill to speak to a conservative political conference.</p>
<p>“We had to move heaven and earth to get you here for just two hours,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., who noted that Mr. Pompeo used to berate the Obama administration about the need to hear testimony from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>“It is shameful” that “you are going to talk to a special interest group,” while only giving two hours to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. Mr. Pompeo was expected to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference’s annual meeting.</p>
<p>Committee chairman Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., called it an “embarrassment,” while Republicans fired back, saying their colleagues were being disrespectful to the secretary of state.</p>
<p>“This is exhausting,” said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who accused Democrats of trying to get a “YouTube moment” out of the hearing.</p>
<p>Until Friday, Mr. Pompeo had not made a public appearance on Capitol Hill for months. The shortened appearance resulted in Democrats trying to maximize their time through the use of yes or no questions — a format that Mr. Pompeo refused to acquiesce to, resulting in combative, interruption-laden exchanges.</p>
<p>“That’s a straw-man argument,” Mr. Pompeo told Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., who tried to pin him down on a yes or no question related to the border wall and the coronavirus.</p>
<p>When Mr. Pompeo avoided one-word responses, Democrats attempted to reclaim their time to move to another question. Republicans accused them of failing to let the secretary speak, while Mr. Engel said they wouldn’t have to resort to the simplistic format if Mr. Pompeo would agree to stay longer — a request he rejected.</p>
<p>The result was exchanges that were light on substance but heavy on conflict. Democrats questioned the Trump administration’s Iran policy, which they noted has resulted in more attacks on American interests and an expansion of Iran’s nuclear program. On the latter point, Mr. Pompeo conceded that Iran has “enriched to a higher level than they did when we took office.”</p>
<p>The original topic of the hearing was to discuss the U.S. killing of Iranian Gen. Qasim Soleimani, but lawmakers peppered Mr. Pompeo with questions about the coronavirus, which has spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan to nearly every continent.</p>
