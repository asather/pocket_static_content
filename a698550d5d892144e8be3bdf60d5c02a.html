<h1>Judge approves sale of bankrupt GNC to Chinese investor for $770 million</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A bankruptcy court judge on Thursday approved the sale of troubled Pittsburgh vitamin and health supplements maker GNC Holdings Inc. to China-based Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co. for $770 million.</p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware Judge Karen B. Owens praised lawyers for the debtors and creditors on the uncontested sale during a hearing Thursday. Plans to auction GNC’s assets had been canceled in favor of an outright sale after no higher qualified bids than Harbin’s were submitted to the court by the Sept. 11 deadline.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased with the efforts and more than happy to approve the sale,” Judge Owens said during the hearing.</p>
<p>GNC was founded as Lackzoom Health Store by David B. Shakarian on Wood Street Downtown in 1936. The company name was changed to General Nutrition Centers in 1959 before undergoing rapid growth with the opening of stores internationally in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>Battered by competition and the availability of online vitamins and supplements, GNC in May reported a $200.1 million net loss for the first quarter of 2020, which compared with a $15.3 million loss the year before.</p>
<p>The company had operated about 7,300 stores, but said last fall that it planned to close 800 to 1,200 of them as it tried to regain its financial footing.</p>
<p>The deal gives the Downtown-based company badly needed breathing room at a time when GNC shares have been trading for less than 25 cents. It&nbsp;filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June.</p>
<p>The sale price approved at Thursday’s hearing included $550 million in cash, $210 million in second lien loans and $10 million in subordinated convertible notes — short-term debt issued by Harbin — for unsecured creditors.</p>
<p>Harbin has owned 40% of the vitamin retailer since 2018, making it GNC’s biggest shareholder.</p>
<p>An initial offer of $760 million for the iconic Pittsburgh company was sweetened with an additional $10 million for unsecured creditors, debtor’s counsel Caroline A. Reckler, from the firm of Chicago-based Latham &amp; Watkins, said during the hearing.</p>
<p>The sale was expected to close by the end of the year, but the impact on Pittsburgh jobs was less clear.</p>
<p>About 600 people worked at GNC headquarters Downtown as of last fall. In a statement, the company said it was pleased by the court’s decision, but declined to answer workforce questions Thursday.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, of Florida, recently expressed concerns about the proposed GNC sale, citing the risk of customers’ personal information being exposed to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Ms. Reckler dismissed those concerns, telling the court that Harbin’s 2018 investment in GNC was cleared by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and also in subsequent audits.</p>
