<h1>Jason Mackey: Presenting a better way to get baseball going again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Major League Baseball’s plan to potentially play its entire 2020 season in an Arizona biosphere probably won’t happen, but it does have some promise. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the strongest voice on the coronavirus pandemic that we have, said so himself.</p>
<p>Which is why I’d like to take this discussion a step further and present an amended return-to-play plan, one that I think is much more practical.</p>
<p>Instead of having the entire baseball world descend on Arizona, let’s do everything in five or six cities, potentially divided by division. In each of those cities, players, coaches and team personnel could bring their immediate families, and they would first isolate, then quarantine, together.</p>
<p>This would essentially turn five or six MLB ballparks into regional hubs. It might even make sense to use cities with domed or retractable-roof stadiums, avoiding rainouts.</p>
<p>If you go by division, that could theoretically put hubs in Miami (NL East), Milwaukee (NL Central), Arizona (NL West), Houston (AL West), Tampa Bay (AL East) and Minnesota (AL Central).</p>
<p>Each city would have at least five hotels reserved exclusively for teams and those traveling with them. Normally, this is probably impossible. Now, it might be a welcomed injection of capital into a fledgling industry.</p>
<p>The same as Arizona, only travel between the hotel and the ballpark would be allowed. It would also be essential to ensure the hotels were not populated by normal guests; only approved members of each team’s traveling party, which would probably have to include media.</p>
<p>Is there still a risk? Sure. There’s no way to do this without taking some sort of risk. But it’s the same idea as the Arizona plan, where you’re basically quarantined together, and you’re trying to minimize the number of outside factors.</p>
<p>In this scenario, rooms, hallways and elevators would be routinely sanitized and deep-cleaned, paid for by either individual teams or Major League Baseball. Perhaps the league can work out some sort of advertising deal with a hotel chain to promote their properties. The idea would be to get as close to the ballpark as possible. Food could be catered by local businesses.</p>
<p>Next would come sort of schedule. The Arizona plan wanted to play by games mid-May. That’s nuts. Instead of that, wait until June 1 to start the chain of events that will be required to do something like this and do it safely.</p>
<p>Starting in June, approved personnel would self-isolate on-site for two weeks, the process weeding out anyone who shows symptoms. Three weeks of spring training would follow, with teams completing workouts throughout the day at their designated ballpark. That would put opening day on or around July 7.</p>
<p>The goal here would be to play at least 81 games, all against division teams. If someone lobbied for more, fine. But I think you need a minimum of 81. Starting the season around July 7 would give us 86 calendar days through the end of September, meaning we could easily play 81 or more in the standard amount of time.</p>
<p>We could play more via doubleheaders or stretch the season longer if that was important. Or we could try to preserve a normal offseason heading into 2021, when hopefully baseball could return as normal. I think it’s also important to remember that this might be difficult for those involved; maybe it’s best to keep it a reasonable length.</p>
<p>After however many games, division champions would be crowned. We would also award one wild card spot. All eight teams would advance to one central location — maybe Arizona’s Chase Field, in large part because of weather — for the postseason tournament.</p>
<p>However, before playoffs could start, approved personnel from the qualifying clubs must isolate once more — after designated hotels or living spaces were sanitized and deep cleaned. The home ballpark, too.</p>
<p>You’d probably have to shorten the playoffs, keeping the division series to three games apiece since you’d have eight teams and one field. You could also do NL and AL playoff hubs, although I don’t like the idea of isolating a third time.</p>
<p>If you go three, five and seven games through the division series, league championship series and World Series, maybe, with a little luck, you’d finish the playoffs inside of three weeks. It would be a rush, but it’s one of the reasons I think you end the regular season in late September.</p>
<p>Rosters would have to expand. One, because guys will have been off for roughly three months by the start of spring training 2.0 in mid-June. Two, because of the shortened ramp-up time.</p>
<p>Rosters would include around 30 players, plus a group of guys who have self-isolated, have been working out and are able to step in if something happens. There would be no calling up from the minors because, one, the minor league season might not happen and, two, the two-week period to make sure the player was not symptomatic.</p>
<p>Important to note: This could obviously change with testing, though we shouldn’t prioritize testing for baseball players because we want to see sports on TV. Only adjust if testing throughout society becomes more readily available.</p>
<p>TV- and media-wise, it would be a gold mine. Baseball would be king. When ratings soar, there should be people smart enough to monetize that, whether it’s via online streaming, the Extra Innings package, advertising, whatever.</p>
<p>And speaking of TV, I would advocate for one or two TV crews to produce all of the games at a given site. It’s one way to control costs while keeping the body count around these clubs low.</p>
<p>One potential issue here could be the schedule. I’m proposing splitting things up by division, and that would make for some continuity in an otherwise unconventional season. But all of baseball’s divisions are five teams, meaning someone will always have nobody to play.</p>
<p>I don’t like the idea of redrafting divisions. I also don’t like going away from baseball’s series structure. But I could be talked into having games every day, sometimes two, then having three days off out of every 15 on the schedule, rotating that off-series like a bye week in football.</p>
<p>Surely there are holes you could poke in this premise, the same as the Arizona plan. It’ll be that way no matter what anybody presents. But the key is to find the best-case scenario for all involved, finding what both sides can live with and what they cannot. Family is understandable in this context.</p>
<p>Adjusting the Arizona plan would not only put the product on the field — what everybody wants — but it would do it in a way that would support local businesses while also making players feel safe.</p>
