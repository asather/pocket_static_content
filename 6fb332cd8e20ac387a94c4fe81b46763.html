<h1>Pittsburgh Opera to keep live performances but in a smaller venue</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Opera has announced changes to its upcoming season due to concerns about COVID-19.</p>
<p>Instead of staging four operas at the Benedum Center, the company will present four operas at the Pittsburgh Opera headquarters in the Strip District in a smaller performance studio with limited seating. At least one performance from each opera will also be live-streamed.</p>
<p>“At this time, even an optimistic scenario could have mass gatherings this fall and next spring in Allegheny County limited to 250 people,” said Christopher Hahn, general director of Pittsburgh Opera in a statement released Monday. “It just doesn’t make sense to perform in the 2,800-seat Benedum Center if we can only have 250 people in the building.”</p>
<p>The opera’s headquarters has a studio space that holds up to 195 people. Pittsburgh Opera will follow state social distancing and sanitation guidelines for both performers and audiences, including strict traffic control, distanced seating, masks and more. The orchestra will be reduced and there will not be a chorus at these performances. The opera will continue to monitor state health guidelines and announce any changes.</p>
<p>On Monday, the opera will start contacting people who have already purchased tickets to discuss options. Ticket holders can trade for a different performance, receive a refund or donate the cost of the ticket to support Pittsburgh Opera. After they have decided, the opera may be able to sell additional tickets to the fall performances.</p>
<p><strong>Pittsburgh Opera’s new lineup</strong></p>
<p>Mozart’s “Cosi fan tutte”: Oct. 17-29</p>
<p>David T. Little’s “Soldier Songs”: Dec. 5-17</p>
<p>Handel’s “Semele”: Feb. 20-March 4</p>
<p>Daniel Schnyder and Bridgette Wimberly’s&nbsp;“Charlie Parker’s Yardbird”: April 10-22</p>
<p>Currently, each opera is scheduled for six performances. The casts will comprise Pittsburgh Opera resident artists, rising professionals on a two-year contract with the company and some visiting artists. Details on casting will be announced this week.</p>
<p>The opera will continue to produce other events both live and virtual with seating capacity determined by health directives. A lineup of these events can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pittsburghopera.org/" target="_blank">pittsburghopera.org</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the opera’s previously scheduled lineup of&nbsp;“Rusalka,”&nbsp;“The Magic Flute” and&nbsp;“Emmeline” will be moved to the 2021-22 season. “Carmen,” which was supposed to be presented in March, will also be rescheduled for the 2021-22 season, which will feature a world premiere performance of&nbsp;“In a Grove” with music by Christopher Cerrone and a libretto by Stephanie Fleischmann.&nbsp;Verdi’s&nbsp;“Aida,” which was supposed to run March 2021, has been tentatively rescheduled for March 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The opera is selling subscriptions for the 2021-22 season; individual tickets will go on sale in the summer of 2021.</p>
