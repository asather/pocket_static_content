<h1>Allegheny County: Ballot scanning a 'tiring' process, but election went 'fairly smooth'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County voters cast about 209,000 votes by mail or absentee ballots and 101,000 at in-person polling places in the 2020 Pennsylvania primary election, officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>As of about 2:30 p.m., county staffers were working to upload the final batch of results onto their website, encompassing a total of 311,325 votes. With an estimated 770,000 eligible Democrats and Republicans in the county, the turnout landed at about 40 percent.</p>
<p>County officials had hoped to finish the count by the end of Tuesday, but decided at around 2 a.m. to reconvene on Wednesday afternoon to finish scanning in-person ballots from about 500 voting precincts.</p>
<p>Elections manager David Voye said the process was "very long, tiring and time-consuming," but overall — with help from different county departments — he thought "it went fairly smooth."</p>
<p>The process is not over yet, though. For one, ballots received by the county by next Tuesday — by mail — will be counted, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day. This is because Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order extending the deadline.</p>
