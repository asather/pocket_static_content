<h1>Rep. Doyle, taking aim at tech giants’ legal shield, throws cold water on Trump’s feud with Twitter</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, have this in common: They both say they want to reform the liability shield that has allowed platforms to flourish during the internet’s early days, but is today blamed for protecting tech giants from scrutiny.</p>
<p>The agreement ends there.</p>
<p>While Mr. Trump has attacked Twitter for publicly labeling his tweets as harmful content, Mr. Doyle argued social media companies aren’t doing nearly enough to stem the scourge of hate speech and disinformation — the kind of messages the congressman accuses the president of amplifying on those very platforms.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Doyle made it clear he has no intention to take up the Trump administration’s request last week that Congress repeal sections of the law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.</p>
<p>The changes, recommended by the U.S. Department of Justice following an executive order from Mr. Trump, effectively would open the door to civil lawsuits against companies like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube for posts with illegal and harmful content.</p>
<p>“The intent of these actions is clear: to bully social media companies into inaction,” Mr. Doyle said during his opening comments at a congressional hearing Wednesday with the despairing title “A Country in Crisis: How Disinformation Online is Dividing the Nation.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s actions have muddied an already fraught debate over free speech, telecommunications law and the real-time fact-checking of news and information coursing through internet platforms.</p>
<p>Lawmakers of both parties have long agreed the law should be updated to better regulate social media platforms. In October, Mr. Doyle, who heads&nbsp;the committee’s panel overseeing communications and technology issues, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2019/10/16/Congress-internet-big-tech-hate-speech-Mike-Doyle-reddit-google-youtube/stories/201910170040?cid=search" target="_blank">convened a similar hearing</a> that discussed the law’s approach to hate speech, fake news and illegal activity.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Doyle said reforming the law was necessary to address the proliferation of algorithms that reward companies with profits while promoting incendiary content.</p>
<p>“They have built systems to spread it at scale and monetize the way it confirms our implicit biases,” he said, which has resulted in the spreading of lies about the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, voting by mail and civil unrest over police brutality. “These companies have made trillions of dollars by feeding people what they want to hear.”</p>
<p>When passed in 1996, Section 230 clarified legal uncertainty after a pair of conflicting rulings in online defamation cases.</p>
<p>Those cases effectively discouraged companies from moderating user-posted content at all after one platform was found liable for a defamatory post because it tried to referee its website, but missed the harmful post. Section 230 was intended to be a shield for companies to create their own guidelines and moderate how they see fit.</p>
<p>That obligation to moderate has been called into question by lawmakers and advocates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neil Fried, principal at DigitalFrontiers Advocacy and former counsel to Mr. Doyle’s panel, recommended reforming the law to require internet platforms to take “reasonable, good faith steps” to fight fake news as a condition of receiving Section 230’s protection.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he said, companies will continue to “reap the benefits of the shield, while they drop the sword.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Representatives of the largest tech firms were noticeably absent Wednesday. <span class="comment"><br></span></p>
<p>At the October hearing, Steve Huffman, co-founder and CEO of Reddit, testified his platform’s self-moderating forum model “relies on Section 230” and that “even small changes to the law will have outsized consequences.”</p>
<p>Hany Farid, an electrical engineering and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, testified the COVID-19 pandemic has been an “ideal breeding ground” for online misinformation as people take to social media while forced to remain at home, “often idle, anxious and hungry for information.”</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle has done battle before with the president over issues of COVID-19 disinformation and free speech.</p>
<p>In April, Mr. Doyle <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/04/03/COVID-19-health-emergency-FCC-Trump-campaign-political-disinformation/stories/202004030123" target="_blank">demanded the Federal Communications Commission</a> condemn the Trump campaign’s request that some broadcasters' FCC licenses be revoked for airing a Joe Biden television ad.&nbsp;</p>
