<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pittsburgh Public Schools employee is self-quarantined out of “extreme caution,” Pittsburgh Post-Gazette news partner KDKA reported.</p>
<p>The employee will be quarantined for the next 14 days.</p>
<p>According to KDKA, the district said the employee has a family member from the eastern part of Pennsylvania that recently came home. That family member is under self-quarantine due to possibly being exposed to coronavirus at a conference in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The district said the employee started to self-quarantine before their family member returned to Pittsburgh. It also said there is no risk to students, staff or families.</p>
