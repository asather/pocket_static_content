<h1>2 Buffalo, N.Y., police officers suspended after shoving 75-year-old protester</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two Buffalo, N.Y., police officers were suspended without pay Thursday night after a video showed them shoving a 75-year-old protester, who was hospitalized with a head injury, the authorities said.</p>
<p>Mayor Byron Brown said the man was in serious but stable condition. A video showed the man motionless on the ground and bleeding from his right ear.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo condemned the actions of the officers in a statement late Thursday.</p>
<p>“The incident in Buffalo is wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful,” Cuomo said. “I’ve spoken with City of Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown and we agree that the officers involved should be immediately suspended. Police officers must enforce — NOT ABUSE — the law.”</p>
<p>“It sickens me,” the Erie County executive, Mark Poloncarz, wrote on Twitter about what the video posted by the radio station WBFO shows. It includes both vulgarity and disturbing images.</p>
<p>In the video, an officer who pushed the man appeared to start to check on him but was nudged to leave by another officer. Someone could be overheard saying, “Get a medic, right now.”</p>
<p>The police department initially told local media that “one person was injured when he tripped and fell” and that there were five arrests during the protest.</p>
<p>The mayor, Brown, said in a statement that he was disturbed by the episode and that the city’s police commissioner had ordered an immediate investigation.</p>
<p>“After days of peaceful protests and several meetings between myself, police leadership and members of the community, tonight’s event is disheartening,” he said.</p>
