<h1>Ron Cook: Jason Zucker has unspectacular yet promising debut with Penguins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins are good enough to win the Stanley Cup.</p>
<p>They are within three points of first-place Washington in the Metropolitan Division and have a game in hand despite losing Tuesday night to Tampa Bay in overtime, 2-1. They will be even better when Brian Dumoulin, John Marino, Dominik Kahun and Nick Bjugstad return from injury.</p>
<p>The goaltending is there; Matt Murray was really good again Tuesday night with 36 saves. The commitment to playing a 200-foot game is there. The star power. The coaching.</p>
<p>But the Eastern Conference is brutal, so much stronger than the West. A first-round playoff matchup is likely for the Penguins against the New York Islanders, Columbus, Philadelphia or Carolina. All are really good teams. It won’t be shocking if the Penguins go out early, as they did last year against the Islanders, or in the second round, as they did the season before against Washington.</p>
<p>Only one thing is certain: Jim Rutherford has given the Penguins their best chance.</p>
<p>I loved the Jason Zucker trade. I liked that Rutherford characteristically jumped early to make it Monday night, not waiting until the Feb. 24 deadline when things get hectic and the price tag often goes up. I didn’t even mind that he gave up a first-round draft pick and a top defensive prospect to Minnesota.</p>
<p>Draft picks in hockey aren’t like draft picks in the NFL. Very few players step right in and play, Sidney Crosby a notable exception. As for young defenseman Calen Addison, who may or may not turn out to be a solid NHL player, he became expendable with Marino’s breakout season.</p>
<p>Rutherford wants to win now with Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang still excelling. Clearly, he likes his team. You might say he’s all in. How do you not love that about him?</p>
<p>Zucker’s debut against the Lightning was, well, just say it wasn’t Mario Lemieux scoring on the first shot of his first shift in his first Penguins game. He played 15½ minutes, skating with Crosby and Patric Hornqvist in the first two periods and with Crosby and Dominik Simon in the third. He had five shots on goal, although none was a terrific scoring chance.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I played very well tonight,” Zucker said. “I thought my hands were terrible. I mishandled pretty much every puck I touched.”</p>
<p>Mike Sullivan offered a more positive review, a more realistic one considering it was just one game and Zucker’s first here after spending the first 8½ seasons of his career with Minnesota.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he’s had a lot of emotions coming into the game tonight, but I thought he had a good first game. I think his speed is evident. His ability to shoot the puck, I think with more familiarity, will get better.”</p>
<p>It’s fun to think about the Penguins’ lineup once Zucker gets going. They have badly needed a left wing since Jake Guentzel and his 40-goal capability were lost — probably for the season — Dec. 30. Zucker allowed Jared McCann to drop down to left wing on the second line Tuesday with Malkin and Bryan Rust. The third line is set with Zach-Aston Reese, Teddy Blueger and Brandon Tanev.</p>
<p>The team desperately needs a fourth line and will get one once Kahun returns, presumably on Malkin’s left wing. That will leave McCann, Hornqvist or Simon (and perhaps Bjugstad) as capable fourth-liners getting more than the 5:08 that Sam Lafferty played against the Lightning or the 3:19 that Andrew Agozzino received.</p>
<p>The Penguins are at their best when they play with speed and roll four lines. Zucker will help them do both.</p>
<p>Rutherford has been infatuated with Zucker for three years and nearly got him last summer in a trade for Phil Kessel before Kessel vetoed the deal. Rutherford isn’t afraid to be bold and almost always gets what he wants. I think back to the Tanev signing on the first day of free agency last summer for six years, $21 million, term and money that were widely criticized.</p>
<p>“It’s the way things work on July 1,” Rutherford said at the time. “You either give the player close to what he wants or you don’t get the player. And we felt so strong about Tanev that we were willing to go as far as we had to go to make sure we got him.”</p>
<p>Tanev has played in all 55 games and has been one of the Penguins’ more physical, consistent players. “I think he’s the guy we thought we were getting, and then some,” Sullivan said earlier this month.</p>
<p>Zucker, who is signed through the 2022-23 season, has the chance to be the same kind of impact player. It sounded as if he wanted to be with the Penguins as much as Rutherford wanted him. He did his homework, talking at length about the Penguins to former Wild teammate Matt Cullen and to Bill Guerin, who was a Rutherford lieutenant before becoming the Minnesota general manager last August.</p>
<p>“I’m grateful for this opportunity,” Zucker said. “This is such an amazing franchise. I’ve heard nothing but amazing things prior to being here. It’s surreal being a part of it.”</p>
<p>Tuesday night was just the start for Zucker, who sounded awfully glad that his Penguins debut is behind him.</p>
<p>“I think I will be better next game.”</p>
