<h1>Pennsylvanians are heading across state lines for haircuts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With salons now open in Ohio and West Virginia, many Pennsylvanians are flocking across state lines for a haircut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hair salons, barbershops and nail salons in Ohio were permitted to reopen May 15 after being closed since mid-March to help curb the spread of COVID-19. In West Virginia, they’ve been back in business since May 4.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf ordered health and wellness facilities, including spas and salons, to remain closed in Pennsylvania until the county where they’re located is cleared for the green phase, the least restrictive category in his tiered reopening plan. The decision <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/fashion/2020/05/13/Should-Pennsylvania-salons-be-allowed-to-open-in-yellow-phase-COVID-19/stories/202005130035" target="_blank">has sparked backlash from many&nbsp;local salon owners</a> who are urging the governor to let them open along with surrounding businesses in yellow-phase counties. Some are even threatening to return to work in June, with or without his permission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The governor vetoed a bill last week that would have granted salons a waiver to reopen before the green phase. A House vote to override a veto was 21 votes shy of the two-thirds majority needed for the override.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But finding a barber or hairdresser in another state with an empty chair will take patience and planning. Many are giving priority to their regular customers, particularly those whose previous appointments were canceled. Most also have stopped welcoming walk-ins.</p>
<p>People from Pennsylvania are “calling like hotcakes,” said Lori Hutchison, who owns Lori’s Hair Salon in East Liverpool, Ohio, about 40 miles from Downtown Pittsburgh.&nbsp;“The problem is no one in Ohio has time to do them.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Envoy Salon in Steubenville, Ohio, also about 40 miles away, owner Rachael Schrader said her business couldn’t accommodate new clients for at least three weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think people are scrambling and calling, but we honestly can’t take anybody who we don’t normally have,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Wheeling, W.Va., a roughly 80-minute drive from Pittsburgh, Randy Scenna of Frank’s Hairquarters has had people from out of state just show up at his door.</p>
<p>“I always have to send them away. I feel really bad,” he said. “I’m the only one in the shop and I don’t have any time for them. They must be desperate.”</p>
<p>Some salons are taking names and phone numbers so they can contact newcomers when their books open up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Absolutely every [new] call we get right now has been from Pennsylvania. We have pages of people,” said&nbsp;Meshelle Tusick, who co-owns Locks and Legends Beauty Salon in Weirton, W.Va.&nbsp;“A lot of us are booked up until the middle of July.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some newer stylists who are still building their clientele may have more flexibility in coming weeks, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have been able to get quite a few people from Pennsylvania in because they deserve to get their hair done,” she said.</p>
<p>Emma Folk, 16, of Jefferson Hills, got lucky with an appointment at Locks and Legends Beauty Salon when there was a cancellation.</p>
<p>She had been on a waiting list for a week, she said, and learned about the salon through searching the internet and reading reviews. After six months without a haircut, it was time for a makeover to tide her over until her regular salon, Studio Bliss in Pleasant Hills, reopens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I had called one salon prior to that, but they were booked to the T,” she said.&nbsp;“I went with a major change. I went from blond to brown.”</p>
<p>Dorrae McGinnis, 61, of Carnegie, paid Locks and Legends Beauty Salon a visit after she tried to cut her own hair,&nbsp;“which was a disaster.” She called on a Tuesday and got an appointment for three days later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“My hair is always short, so for it to grow 2 inches, that’s a lot for me,” she said.&nbsp;“I’m afraid if even my regular hairdresser [at Talk of the Town in Crafton] opens up tomorrow, she’s still going to be 2½ months behind, and I can’t wait another 2½ months.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Others who traveled out of state for a haircut or personal care service declined to comment for this story.&nbsp;One person didn’t want to talk to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette because she said she was afraid of being judged and shamed.</p>
<p>Big hair salon chains are pushing online appointment platforms to help manage the demand.&nbsp;You might even snag a same-day appointment if you don’t mind waiting hours.</p>
<p><a href="/GreatClips.com" target="_blank">GreatClips.com</a> features a check-in map that tracks the average wait time at nearby locations. On a recent weekday afternoon, the tracker said to expect to wait 141 minutes for an opening at the Great Clips in Wintersville, Ohio, about 40 miles from Pittsburgh. One in Tridelphia, W.Va., a 25-mile&nbsp; drive from Washington, Pa., estimated an approximately three-hour wait.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to online booking, Supercuts locations post the phone number on the door. Customers are welcome to call for an appointment and wait in the parking lot, said&nbsp;Mike Sarafa, CEO of Alline Salon Group, which owns salon brands Holiday Hair, Supercuts and Cost Cutters.</p>
<p>In Ohio, these salons are seeing a surge in customers not only from Pennsylvania but also from Michigan, where hair service providers are still temporarily out of work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I saw that myself first-hand when I went to Toledo, Ohio,” Mr. Sarafa said.&nbsp;“I talked to many people in the parking lot. All the clients I saw were very happy, very patient. Stylists were getting big tips.”</p>
<p>Beyond the rush of people clamoring for haircuts, appointments are scarce because many salons are operating at limited capacity to allow for social distancing. Others have increased the breaks between customers to give ample time for cleaning and safety measures such as temperature checks when clients arrive.</p>
<p>“When you have to have masks on ... and shower curtains hanging from the ceilings to separate us, it’s a little different, but we’re trying to make it lighthearted,” said Jim Woofter, owner of Our Place Family Hair Care in Moundsville, W.Va., about 25 miles from the Pennsylvania border.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He hasn’t noticed an influx in requests from out of state so far.</p>
<p>“We've been in business for 30 years, so we have 30 years of clients we’re trying to take care of,” he said.</p>
<p>While salon owners recognize the need for restrictions, extended salon closures in Pennsylvania and the backlog of appointments elsewhere are causing more problems than just graying roots and overgrown locks.</p>
<p>“You have a whole unregulated environment that’s going on underground,” Mr. Sarafa said.</p>
<p>He has heard stories about people offering haircuts and other personal care services in their homes or out of sight in their salons. This can pose safety risks if not done properly.</p>
<p>“There are all kinds of unintended negative consequences,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Salons can be penalized or have their licenses revoked by the Pennsylvania State Board of Cosmetology if they operate during the closure. That includes creating for their clients at-home hair coloring kits, which also are illegal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, salons in Ohio and West Virginia are busy — and sympathetic.</p>
<p>“I feel sad for the salons up there,” Ms. Tusick, the Weirton salon owner, said. “I know it's very hard for them.”</p>
