<p><em>EDITOR’S NOTE: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2020/03/11/Celine-Dion-postpones-Pittsburgh-concert-due-to-cold/stories/202003110087" target="_blank">Celine Dion has postponed her Pittsburgh concert because of illness. The show has been rescheduled for Nov. 18</a>.</em></p>
<p>Celine Dion’s powerful pipes will sing out in Pittsburgh for the first time in more than two decades when her Courage World Tour arrives Nov. 18.</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong> Nov. 18, 2020</p>

<p>The 120-date tour comes after Dion spent 16 years in a Las Vegas residency, and follows the release of her album&nbsp;“Courage” in November. By way of a welcome back, here are some fast facts about the Canadian pop diva.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WN-ZHOHmvcw" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>1) First things first:</strong> The Quebec native’s first album, "La Voix Du Bon Dieu,” was released in 1981, when Dion was 13 years old. It was produced by her husband-to-be, René Angelil (they married when she turned 26). The once and future pop ballad queen released her first English-language album,&nbsp;“Unison,” in 1990.</p>
<p><strong>2) The heart of the matter:</strong> Now the winner of eight Grammys, among 19 nominations, Dion rode the wave of “Titanic” success with the Oscar-winning “My Heart Will Go On.” The megahit movie opened on Dec. 19, 1997, but Dion was already a pop favorite by then. She first hit the U.S. charts in 1990 with "Where Does My Heart Beat Now,” her first single to reach the top 10.</p>
<p><strong>3) Last time you may have seen her here:</strong> Dion played Pittsburgh on <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/celine-dion/1997/civic-arena-pittsburgh-pa-23cc501f.html" target="_blank">April 4, 1997</a>, during her Falling Into You: Around the World tour, and again in her Let’s Talk About Love Tour on Nov. 29, 1998, selling out the Civic Arena for both dates.</p>
<p><strong>4) Streaming doc:</strong> The Courage World Tour is her first in more than a decade, since her year-long Taking Chances World Tour (2008-2009). Those concerts are the subject of the documentary "Celine: Through the Eyes of the World” (rentable on Prime Video).</p>
<p><strong>5) Why “Courage”?:</strong> Within two days in 2016, Dion lost her husband and longtime manager, René Angelil, and brother Daniel to cancer. Lyrics to the single include: <em>“Courage don’t you dare fail me now / ‘Cause it’s not easy, when you’re not with me / This world of madness goes faster now / And it's a train wreck but I won't crash yet / Long as your echo never fades out.”</em></p>
<p><strong>6) Back with a bang:</strong> There was a lull between English-speaking studio albums before “Courage,” which <a href="https://www.billboard.com/video/celine-dion-debuts-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-chart-with-courage-billboard-news-8544879" target="_blank">debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart</a> in November — her fifth No. 1 album, but her first in 17 years. She now has No. 1 albums in each of the past three decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7) What happened in Vegas:</strong> Although Dion hasn’t toured in recent years, fans flocked to her. On June 8, 2019, Dion took the final bow of her 16-year Las Vegas residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. According to celinedion.com, in March 2003, she “forever changed the landscape of Las Vegas entertainment” with the premiere of “A New Day.” It played 717 shows through Dec. 15, 2007. She returned to Caesars in 2011 with “Celine,” which played 424 shows, for a total of 1,141 shows that were seen by 4.5 million fans.</p>
<p><strong>8) Style icon:</strong> She has a fashion line for grownups and one called Celinununu —&nbsp;gender-neutral clothing for children. Her video for “Imperfections,” a single from the “Courage” album, plays like a black-and-white fashion shoot with her in full red-carpet mode. Dion cemented her reputation as a fashionista in the now famous — infamous, for some — Dior by John Galliano backward white tuxedo, topped with a white fedora, that she wore to the 1999 Oscars.</p>
<p><strong>9) A rapper in the family:</strong>&nbsp;Dion is a mother of three — Rene Charles, Nelson and Eddy Angelil. <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/celine-dions-rapping-son-rene-charles-angelil-kept-big-tip-a-big-secret" target="_blank">According to the Montreal Gazette</a>, Rene Charles, aka the rapper Big Tip, began his music career without telling his mom what he was up to — he secretly recorded two songs in his home studio and released them in 2018 on the streaming platform SoundCloud, then confessed to his mother after Big Tip’s songs went to No. 1 and No. 2 on the Canadian SoundCloud R&amp;B charts.</p>
<p><strong>10) Rave on:</strong> Ramin Setoodeh, reviewing Dion's performance at Brooklyn's Barclay Center on Feb. 28, at first gushed about her wardrobe, then had this to say: “ ‘Courage’ is about Dion’s voice, and at 51, she’s still one of the best in the business. It’s hard to overstate just how pitch-perfect Dion’s singing is, but here’s just one example. When she belts out her 1993 ballad 'The Power of Love,' the high notes are as crisp and goosebump-inducing as they are on the nearly 30-year-old studio recording.'</p>
