<p>A Perry Hilltop man is charged with looting Kashi Jewelers on Fifth Avenue in Downtown during Saturday’s protests against the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Keith Harris, 20, is charged with burglary, riot, criminal mischief, escape and receiving stolen property after Pittsburgh police officers saw him fleeing shortly after they said he broke out a window at Starbucks on Penn Avenue and then another across the street at 7-Eleven.</p>
<p>He is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on July 8.</p>
<p>According to the criminal complaint, officers saw Harris standing in front of Starbucks with a red brick in each hand on Saturday around 8:15 p.m. Lt. Art Baker then saw him break the windows at Starbucks and at 7-Eleven.</p>
<p>Detectives in the area then saw Harris running in the direction of Fort Duquesne Boulevard and Sixth Street, and demanded that he stop.</p>
<p>Harris dropped his backpack and continued to run.</p>
<p>He was eventually stopped by additional officers arriving on scene.</p>
<p>According to the criminal complaint, Harris’ backpack contained cash, as well as jewelry still in holders from a display case; additional loose jewelry; two pairs of new tennis shoes and loose pieces of safety glass, as well as a card identifying him as Keith Harris.</p>
<p>Detectives went to Kashi Jewelers on Fifth Avenue, where the windows had been smashed out a short time before, and the owner, Ron Kashi, identified the missing jewelry as belonging to his store. The glass found in the backpack, also matched the window in the store, the criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>Harris also was wanted on three outstanding warrants. He has previous convictions in Allegheny County for reckless endangerment, conspiracy and carrying a firearm without a license.</p>
