<h1>Mike White's high school sports chat transcript: 04.07.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: So there are no high school sports. But we can still talk about them, can't we? Welcome. Maybe for the next hour we can talk, be positive, forget about the troubles for a little. So fire away. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: But first, a little plug about a future Post-Gazette endeavor that has been really interesting and for me to put together - and you might find interesting. Coming out Friday we will have our "all-time" Fab 5 teams - boys and girls. This is the 40th anniversary of the first Fab 5, so we thought we'd pick the best from the 40 years. We actually started working on this before the coronavirus hit. A committee picked the teams. Besides a top five, we did a top 20, based on voting. Coaches and Post-Gazette high school people did the voting. But we also have a fan vote of top 5. Watch for it. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Some of the players who made the top five and top 20 - are pretty obvious. But we put them order from 1-20. A few recent players made the teams. Again, watch for it. But we can discuss now some opinions on top players in 40 years.</p>
<p><strong>Shaun</strong>: Do you think Rochester Lady Rams got a good shot at winning the state in girls basketball if continued and what do you think of the players they have <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: OK Shaun. We can pretend that tournament is starting back up, can't we? I wouldn't say they have a "good shot" at winning it. They're playing North Clarion in quarterfinals. North Clarion is 26-1. Always strong Nativity BVM is on the other side of the bracket. Rochester is good but I wouldn't consider them the favorite.</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: When will section realignments be announced? I know two years ago they were announced in February. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: We've talked about this before. Basketball section alignments for WPIAL are not out yet. The WPIAL wanted to wait until after state tournament. The reason is because of the new PIAA competition formula, which could move a few teams up in class that have a transfer the past two years and also go far in the state tournament. If state playoffs aren't started, who knows what will happen in that rule. That is the reason sectional alignments haven't been released. A few teams in WPIAL might change classifications.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: High School sports are over for this year. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well Jeff, with each passing day it seems to be less and less chance of them starting again this spring. But like I've said before, you still don't have to decide yet. Or at least make the announcement. Let the kids have a little hope. And I still say, even if you can't have spring sports, finish the basketball playoffs in July if you have to.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: hopefully back up and running in September. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Let's hope.</p>
<p><strong>Ray Buckets</strong>: Mike what do you look for when picking your fab 5? The body of work over 4 years or just a year? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Again, it's a number of things. And it's not supposed to be a "career" thing. But I will tell you that if maybe two players are considered equal, we might give a nod to a player who might have had a great career. But not always.</p>
<p><strong>Ga. Fan</strong>: Hi Mike. I should be at 15 watching the early groups decide whether to lay up or go for the green in two. Anyway I came across an article you wrote several years ago about Nellie Cummings. It took me back to the pre-coronavirus times when we had sports. It was a good piece and I appreciated Nellie getting the ink. He had a great game in the State final against a superior team in Neumann-Goretti. Hoping the get to play the tournament this year. Keep up the great dialogue with your fans. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well Ga. Fan, I hear you about the links. Truth be told, I've actually been out. Courses in Ohio and West Virginia have been open. You pay a person outside, use a disinfected cart, don't really come close to anyone else (except my sons) while playing, and putting is interesting. There is a circular ring around the hole, so the ball doesn't fall all the way in the hole. That way, no one touches the pin. But it sure was nice to be outside. As for Cummings, he had a great career. And doing OK at Colgate now also.</p>
<p><strong>Bridger</strong>: Being a great sports writer as you are I was curious if you heard anything about the Ambridge Hoop job? Asterino coming back? Hiring someone else? They play alot of political games in Ambridge I know. And how about North A? Hearing names but not final? Thank you and stay safe Mike! Great work. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Sorry Bridger but I don't know anything about Ambridge job. North Allegheny had second interviews last Monday or Tuesday. I understand 8 to 10 people were interviewed. I know former Vincentian coach Tim Tyree was one. Shelton Carney, father of Butler player Devin Carney, also supposedly had second interview.</p>
<p><strong>Howard Stern</strong>: When is the All Time Fab 5 coming out? Any list that doesn't have Tom Pipkins on it wouldn't be complete! He is WPIAL Basketball! <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: The "all-time" teams will be in our newspaper Friday and also on web. Most likely three pages of this stuff. Hope you like it. I can't give away who the top five picks are. We also picked a top 20 of players, as voted by committee. I will tell you that Tom Pipkins is definitely in the upper half. Why, who else would you take in the top 5?</p>
<p><strong>Howard Stern</strong>: Do you know if WPIAL schools are still paying their spring coaches? Most teams only practiced for 2 weeks. Curious if school will try to save some cash by prorating salaries there. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Sorry, I really don't know answer to that. Maybe I'll try to find it by next week.</p>
<p><strong>Basketball junkie</strong>: Keith Noftz turning up anywhere soon? Mark Jula getting back into it after his quitting or retirement? John Miller sticking with 9th grade? Bill Minear staying at Montour? Avonworth hire? I know bunch of questions. But you are talented and know so much thought you would have some answers? Thank you sir <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Geez, Basketball Junkie, what are you the Riddler? I'll try some answers. Keith Noftz told me when he resigned from NA that he was hopeful of coaching again. Maybe in Ohio. Avonworth job also is open. As for Jula, I don't know anything about him. As for John Miller, I would doubt he'd be back coaching NA 9th grade again. I think he just did that to help out Bob Bozzuto. And after getting spanked by one certain Post-Gazette sports writer's team, I think John has had enough. Ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>@speagles</strong>: Do you think the PIAA is considering no state tournaments for spring sports and allow only modified district tournaments- keeping it all local. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Sorry, but I don't really have any idea what PIAA is thinking. They have not said. I'm sure they have gone over a few "what if" scenarios, but they don't want to make them public. It's just that as days go by, it looks more and more unlikely for spring sports. But I still say, let's wait to make a decision. It is only April 7. Waiting doesn't hurt anything.</p>
<p><strong>Broadway Joe</strong>: Any updates when PIAA will make a decision? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No, Broadway Joe. They will follow Governor's lead. And Broadway Joe, do you still have those pantyhose you wore in that commercial?</p>
<p><strong>Howard Stern</strong>: OK...give me the best warmup mix that Mike White would want to warm up for the big game...4 songs...in order.. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Oh man, Howard Stern. That's a tough one. I like some new - and some old. Call me crazy, but I'll put U2's "Beautiful Day" in there. Something from the one and only Donnie Iris also. ... And then probably Boogie with da Hoodie and Big Sean. ... Now that's a mix you've never heard before.</p>
<p><strong>Sam M</strong>: What happens to eligibility for next year? Is it per sport or per "year"? That is, say a high school student who struggles academically has to repeat a year over this. I can see him not being allowed to play a fifth year of football. But what about a spring sport that didn't get played, like baseball? Actually, what about basketball? The PIAA season never finished. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: This isn't college. I don't know of any talk from PIAA about granting another year of eligibility. And this isn't like college. If you graduate, you can't come back for another year just because you want. You have to move on. No way would they consider another year of basketball eligibility, even if you failed. Would they consider another year of eligibility for a spring for a student who failed as a senior? That would be an interesting debate.</p>
<p><strong>@speagles</strong>: There are all section teams for baseball softball volleyball in spring sports why no tennis teams featured ? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well to be honest, tennis kinds of does "all section" by what happens on the tennis court. Right? I mean, they have individual section tennis tournaments. The four who make it to the semifinals I would say would be all section. So there, now you have your all section teams. Why do you need us or the coaches to do it?</p>
<p><strong>Butch</strong>: We are a month removed the from Diocesan Grade School Basketball Championships. Today, You still get a handful of great HS players who played Diocesan Grade School basketball but it’s just not just what it once was. It wasn’t uncommon where you might have a WPIAL squad with multiple really good Players who player Diocesan grade school basketball. Obviously times have changed, but who are some of the greatest high school players you’ve seen come out of Catholic Grade Schools? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Coming from someone who played four years of Catholic grade school basketball at St. Sebastian (many, many years ago), diocesan basketball isn't even close to what it once was. Why? Pretty simple. Many fewer Catholic grade schools. Many fewer players. Who are some of the greatest from Catholic grade schools? Well, Tom Clements comes to mind right away. St. Malachy in McKees Rocks, right? One of the greatest athletes ever in Western Pa. Went to Canevin. His final two choices in high school were North Carolina as a point guard, or Notre Dame as a QB. He chose football and Notre Dame. Won national title there. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I'll tell you a kid I saw play in Catholic grade school that was amazing. John Ryan from St. James Wilkinsburg. He'd put down 40 without a problem. Went to Wilkinsburg High and then Pitt. Knee problems plagued him. Recently, I know OLSH's Dante Spadafora did some ridiculous things. And Matt Carroll was a great one at St. Alphonsus before he moved out of area and then went to Notre Dame and the NBA.</p>
<p><strong>Skiter Jones</strong>: Why Spencer for COY? His teams are always loaded and he has convenient ties to the Bruins. I feel there are many other coaches that should have gotten it over him. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Are you serious? The guy has been in a WPIAL championship game eight consecutive years with three different teams? And has never been coach of the year. If not now, then when? Yes, other coaches also did really good jobs. And hes, Spencer has had talent. But there is something to be said of doing something with talent - and developing talent also.</p>
<p><strong>Howard Stern</strong>: Hearing a certain college coach with several kids that go to Avonworth is interested in the head job of the Lopes? Any smoke there? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don't know, I don't smoke. I don't have any inside info. But I would imagine you might be talking about LaRoche's Hermie Carmichael. Yes, he does live in Avonworth. And yes, he does have boys (I hear one in 7th grade is very good). But let's think about this. He has a full-time job at LaRoche. Would he give that up just to coach a high school team?</p>
<p><strong>TM</strong>: All-time Fab 5 talk...Devlin (Lebo) vs. Lee (USC)...not sure if they make your list later this week, but those were some of the best one on one in game matchups I have ever seen. What is a couple of your favorite one on one in game matchups over the years? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Devlin was a nice player, but an all-time matchup? Wow. That's a little strong. One all-time great matchup that I will always remember is Sean Miller vs. Dan Aloi in 1986 WPIAL title game at Pitt Field House. I think Aloi had 37, without 3-point line. Miller had big second half. Another great matchup of teams with great individuals was Schenley vs. Aliquippa in 2006. Blair against Pope. Also Kennedy and Kane and Onion vs. Jon Baldwin and Antonio Reddic. It was December game. Revis and Sam Clancy were there to watch. Officials weren't there and both teams were dunking in warmups. It was like a dunk show.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Tornado</strong>: Mike what is your thought process behind coach of the year? LH overcame a lot of odds. But they barely snuck in the playoffs. Got bounced early in states. The golden Tornado lost one game all year with Morton to a lineup, to a team from out of state. When is the last time a coach beat USC, Lebo, NA, Pine, and Central twice in one year? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don't disagree with you Golden Tornado. Very easily could've been Clement. Honestly, they were the two finalists. We put it to a vote. Our high school staff voted Hauger.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Tornado</strong>: Also you referenced in fab 5 video that Morton would be on the top 20 but not the top 5 all time fab 5. I know that was a coach vote, not necessarily your call.<br> <br> Tough to narrow down to the top 5. By the process of elimination I feel like Archie is going to be over him. Personally, feel good about going into a game with Morton being the best player against a team where Archie is the best player. Clear out and post him up every time down and watch him go for another Triple double. Hell give em sean too and double him every time down... Wouldnt matter <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I will tell you Ethan will be on the top 20. Can't tell you where. Ethan and Archie totally different players. Archie was maybe 5-10. Ethan is 6-6. Can't compare the two. Totally different styles. But if I'm starting a game at the courts and I have first pick. I'd take Ethan over Archie. Unless it's a game of HORSE. Then I'd definitely take Archie.</p>
<p><strong>Skiter Jones</strong>: So it's an 8 year body of work and not just a single year. Gotcha <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: What???</p>
<p><strong>Skiter Jones</strong>: Should AAU and/or cup coaches be allowed to coach in high school? I feel there is a huge conflict of interest ($$$). <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: They already do. Yes, you might say a high school coach who coaches AAU might try to get players. Heck, it has happened before. But this isn't the NCAA.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Meant to write that many seniors may not be a available to finish tournament in the summer. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You talking basketball tournament? So what if they're away. Play the hoops tournament over two weekends. I have a hard time believing a kid maybe at a college wouldn't come back home for those two weekends. If they won't - or can't - so be it. If you go on vacation and don't want to play, so be it. Play with who you got. Better than not playing ever. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Thanks everybody, that's it for now. Don't forget all Fab 5 teams and top 20 come out Friday. There seems to be enough talk, so we'll do this again next week. Be good.</p>
