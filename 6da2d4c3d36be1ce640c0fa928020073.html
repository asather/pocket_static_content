<h1>Penguins mailbag: Why isn't John Marino getting more Calder buzz? Trade Justin Schultz?</h1>

<p><em>Welcome back to Mike’s Mailbag!</em></p>
<p><em>Every other week, I beg you for questions and then answer the best ones here in this segment. My bosses call it reader engagement. I just like the idea of making you do half my job for me.</em></p>
<p><em>Need dating advice? Problem with a coworker? Anything else floating around inside that noggin? Nothing is off limits. Of course, I do cover the Penguins, so hockey questions are also very much encouraged. All I ask is that you keep them fun, funny and interesting. If you have a question, tweet me @MikeDeFabo, slide in my DMs or send me an email at mdefabo@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s rip it.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul G.&nbsp;</strong>I saw [the Professional Hockey Writers Association] midseason awards recently. John Marino wasn’t even one of the top three for Calder Trophy. Should he be getting more respect?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> During training camp, I got an email asking if I thought John Marino would win the Calder Trophy as the NHL’s rookie of the year. I actually laughed — like out loud — when I read it. Mind you, this was September. At this time, Marino was still an unknown whom Jim Rutherford acquired for a mere sixth-round pick.</p>
<p>“How about we see if he makes the team?” I said to myself. “Then we can talk rookie of the year.”</p>
<p>I feel like I owe that reader an apology now. No one could have predicted Marino was going to be this good, this fast. He’s poised. Mature. Intelligent. A good skater. All the praise Marino gets, he’s earning.</p>
<p>That said, I don’t see Marino winning the Calder. Unfortunately, he plays an unglamorous position. Sure, fans who watch the Penguins on a nightly basis love Marino for the way he can make a smart decision under pressure or use his speed to snuff out an odd-man rush. There’s no doubt that these plays help the Penguins win.</p>
<p>But they don’t show up on the stat sheet. And that’s the problem. Often, awards are decided on quantifiable metrics like scoring. In that area, Marino has evolved. He’s tallied 24 points (four goals, 20 assists) in 50 games.</p>
<p>However, compare that to some of the others who led the voting. Colorado defenseman Cale Makar, who won the mid-season award from the PHWA, has 11 goals and 27 assists. Second was Vancouver defenseman Quinn Hughes, who has eight goals and 31 assists for 39 points. Third was Buffalo Sabres forward Victor Olofsson, who has 35 points (16 goals and 19 assists).</p>
<p>The fact that we’re having this discussion says something about the player the Penguins have. Best to appreciate him, with or without a trophy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>John A.</strong>&nbsp;I thought the Penguins liked to play left-handed defensemen on the left and righties on the right. So why is Chad Ruhwedel playing the left side while Juuso Riikola is a healthy scratch? What will it take for Riikola to play?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>Well, you are right. The Penguins <em>typically</em> do like to keep defensemen on their dominant sides. But right now, it seems like the goal is to just get the six best defensemen on the ice and then figure out positions from there. We saw a similar approach earlier this season when righties Kris Letang and Marino played on the same pairing. In this situation, Riikola was the scratch.</p>
<p>Now, the Penguins are trying the same six defensemen in a different alignment. And again Riikola is the scratch. Mike Sullivan does like to experiment with different lineup combinations. So you never know, maybe Riikola gets a shot sooner than later. But the fact that the team’s first choice was Ruhwedel on his off side certainly tells you something about how they see Riikola.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Todd G.:</strong>&nbsp;Should the Pens consider trading Justin Schultz? He becomes an unrestricted free agent at the end of the year. Why not get something for him now when you can?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong>&nbsp;I understand that you don’t want to give away what’s essentially a top-four defenseman for nothing. But try looking at the situation a little bit differently. The Penguins are in win-now mode, right? I think you’d agree it makes sense to give up an asset, like a pick or a prospect, to get a player who can help the team make that extra postseason push. That’s exactly what fans and media types are proposing to help Pittsburgh land a top-six winger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, just think of Schultz in that same way. Right now, he’s a valuable defenseman who can run the power play. Worst case: He walks in the offseason. If he helps the Penguins win games, especially in the playoffs, he’s essentially playing the role of a rental right now. Any games he helps the Penguins win now are worth more than what they might get in return.&nbsp;Plus, who knows, maybe the Penguins find some cap room or Schultz decides he wants to take less to stay with a winning organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Matt S</strong>.: If your Italian family could invite one member of this Penguins roster over for dinner, who would that be and what would be served at the dinner table?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong>&nbsp;Joseph Blandisi, for sure. He comes from a good, Italian family that still celebrates the Feast of the Seven Fishes. Plus his mother is in her mid-50s and still plays goalie, so there would be plenty to talk about.</p>
<p>My mom would want to make him gnocchi and cheesecake. But I think I’ve already convinced him to go to my family’s restaurant, Rizzo’s Malabar Inn, in Crabtree. There’s so much good food there. The move is to get pizza and hot peppers with asiago cheese as an appetizer. By the time the veal parm comes for the main course, you’ll be taking most of that home.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa N.:</strong> How do you think your first year on the Pens beat has gone? Does it take a while to establish a routine, and obtain contacts/sources and build a relationship with the players?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>So far, I’m loving the experience. It definitely takes time to build relationships and sources. At the same time, I think there’s also some value in being the new guy who is looking at things in a fresh way.</p>
<p>It’s given me an excuse to walk up to players, introduce myself and ask them some more personal questions. I found some of my favorite stories this way. For example: I was curious why Tristan Jarry wore the Tom and Jerry themed mask. One question led to this story about <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/12/27/tristan-jarry-penguins-goaltender-mask-kristians-pelss/stories/201912260105" target="_blank">how Jarry honors a late teammate.</a></p>
<p>While I’m throwing out shameless plugs for stories… I also really enjoyed meeting Sam Lafferty’s family and writing about his debut with his hometown team<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/10/09/Hollidaysburg-Sam-Lafferty-NHL-debut-pennsylvania-penguins/stories/201910090108" target="_blank"> through the eyes of the ones who raised him</a>. Also, Brandon Tanev has a crazy backstory. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/10/02/brandon-tanev-penguins-contract-sidney-crosby-2019-20-nhl/stories/201910020127" target="_blank">Did you know he didn’t play organized ice hockey for about four years</a>?</p>
<p>Well, now that I’ve suggested other stories for you to read, I guess that means this one is over. Matt Vensel will have his weekly chat next Thursday. I’ll be back on Feb. 20. We should have plenty to talk about with the trade deadline just days away. Who knows, maybe the Penguins will have a new player (or two) to discuss, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until then, remember: There’s no such thing as a stupid question, only stupid people asking them.</p>
