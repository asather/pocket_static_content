<p>The Pennsylvania Air National Guard announced in a statement on Wednesday that two of their aircrafts will fly over hospitals in the Pittsburgh, Johnstown and Harrisburg areas later this week.</p>
<p>The 171st Refueling Wing and the 193rd Special Operations Wing will fly over the hospitals on May 15 as part of Operation American Resolve, a “nationwide salute to all those supporting COVID-19 response efforts.”</p>

<p>“Flyovers are conducted at no additional cost to the taxpayer,” the statement said. “This is an opportunity for the Air Force to salute the Americans who are selflessly supporting our communities during this trying time while also conducting needed training.”</p>
<p>The flyover, which will feature a&nbsp;KC-135 Stratotanker and an EC-130J Super J aircraft, will begin over Forbes hospital in Monroeville at approximately 12:18 p.m., continue over other major hospitals in the Pittsburgh area, and conclude over UPMC Shadyside at approximately 12:26 p.m. The aircraft will then continue on to Johnstown and Harrisburg, respectively.</p>
<p>The Air National Guard also encourages citizens to maintain social distancing to the best of their ability while watching the flyovers.</p>
