<h1>PIAA postpones Class 2A swimming finals, cancels 3A evening session due to COVID-19 concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Laura Goettler went through her routine for the morning session of the PIAA Class 3A finals at Bucknell University’s Kinney Natatorium like she had every other year.</p>
<p>She hit the water, got a solid qualifying time, cooled down and prepared to rest up for the evening finals.</p>
<p>Only that wasn’t how it went.</p>
<p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the PIAA opted to postpone the Class 2A swimming and diving finals, which were scheduled to open on Friday, for at least two weeks. In addition, the state’s governing body also cancelled the evening session of the second day of the Class 3A swimming meet and, instead, allowed the time from the morning qualifiers to stand as the state championship heats.</p>
<p>“We found out right after the morning session,” Goettler said. “It kind of upset me because I wasn’t trying as hard as I could have on that because of the finals, and then I found out there wasn’t any finals.”</p>
<p>It’s not the first time this has happened. Inclement weather forced the PIAA to go to morning timed finals for Class 3A in 2017.</p>
<p>Goettler was fortunate. As the No. 1 seed in the 100-yard breaststroke, she was able to see the times of the competitors that went before her and could try to better that for what would have been a better lane assignment in the final heat. Instead, the Butler senior and Duquesne recruit swam a 1:02.66 that earned her a second consecutive state title in the event.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty frustrating because a lot of swimmers [were leave something in the tank] and we had no idea and I would have prepared differently in that race,” Goettler said. “I’m just happy I didn’t save up too much and get a lower placement.”</p>
<p>Goettler was the only individual girls swimmer to take home a state title, but the North Allegheny 400 freestyle relay foursome of Torie Buerger, Lexi Sundgren, Olivia Kisow and Molly Smyers took the title in 3:26.54, just 0.44 seconds ahead of Upper Dublin.</p>
<p>Josh Matheny was the only WPIAL champion from the boys session. The Upper St. Clair junior, who set a National Federation of High Schools record in the 100 breaststroke at this event last year, didn’t come close to his 52.52-second run from a year ago.</p>
<p>Instead, Matheny, who had stated previously his focus was on the Olympic Trials in June, brought home his third consecutive title in 54.34 seconds, 1.29 seconds faster than Kevin O’Dare of State College.</p>
<p>With the victory, Matheny became the first WPIAL swimmer ever to win the PIAA Class 3A 100 breaststroke three consecutive years and is the first in the state to accomplish the feat since Brendan Hansen of Haverford from 1997-99.</p>
