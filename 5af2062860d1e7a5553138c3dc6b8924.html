<h1>Gaucho to move from Strip to former Six Penn spot Downtown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gaucho Parrilla Argentina, the wildly popular temple of South American-style grilled meats in the Strip District will move to bigger digs in Downtown Pittsburgh by early spring.</p>
<p>The restaurant, which opened in 2013 at 1601 Penn Ave., will take over the space 10 blocks southwest at 146 Sixth St., vacated by Six Penn Kitchen in early 2018. Gaucho has been a local sensation since its opening,&nbsp;routinely drawing crowds that flow out the door, with lines that wrap up the sidewalk of the 16th St. Bridge. It’s been routinely mentioned in national publications about Pittsburgh dining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re pretty excited but with excitement comes a mix of apprehension and terror -- that’s a good word,” chef and owner Anthony Falcon said on Monday. “It’s a beast. It’s not easy to uproot and make change, but everyone has been really supportive.”</p>
<p>Making that transition a little easier is that the space will require little work. Eat'n Park Hospitality opened the 180-seat Six Penn in the Cultural District in 2005 with an outdoor roof terrace, dining rooms and bars on two floors, plate-glass windows facing the street as well as a view of the kitchen across the room.</p>
<p>“They built a beautiful restaurant,” Mr. Falcon said. “It was well appointed and well equipped. We’re not making sweeping changes. They simply decided to close, but the building did not want to stop [being a restaurant]. We’re lucky to have found essentially a turnkey joint that we can get into.”</p>
<p>When Gaucho first opened, it was a small six-seat sandwich shop Mr. Falcon dubbed “Baby Gaucho,” serving a menu of meats cooked over a wood-fired grill, served with charred vegetables and carmelized onions, dressed greens and roasted potatoes. They expanded into a neighboring space for what he called “Gaucho Grande,” which included more seating and a private dining area. In October, they added a liquor license.</p>
<p>“This iteration we’re calling G3,” Mr. Falcon said, and it will include all of those elements, plus some new wrinkles. “The idea is to kind of make it just a little better than it was the last time. Make it a better experience for our guests and our crew.”</p>
<p>Rather than doing counter service, diners will be able to order at their table with a mobile device and a full slate of cocktails, South American wines and draft beer will be available from the bar.</p>
<p>Mr. Falcon hopes to introduce a happy hour and small bites menu, as well as a retail sales area for meats, beverages and grab and go food that can accommodate a range of budgets.</p>
<p>“We have everyone in our space, from baseball players and lawyers to students, and we don't want to change that,” he said.</p>
<p>According to a 2015 Post-Gazette article, Mr. Falcon was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. and his family moved to London, then to Venezuela. His early school days were back in Manhattan and Brooklyn, followed by his teenage years in the Poconos. By his senior year of high school, he ended up in Pittsburgh and went to school at the now-closed Le Cordon Bleu/Pittsburgh Culinary Institute, Downtown.</p>
<p>From there, he worked eight years in Las Vegas as an assistant executive manager for Bally's Hotel &amp; Casino and the Paris Hotel, and rose through the ranks to help oversee dozens of restaurants and a staff of close to 50 chefs and about 500 cooks.</p>
<p>He returned to Pittsburgh in 2005 to run the kitchen at Southpointe Golf Club in Canonsburg and eventually became the head of the food and beverage program there, while saving and planning for what would become Gaucho.</p>
