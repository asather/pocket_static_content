<h1>Proving ground: Finish hyperloop tech before promising its impact </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Few projects excite the public as much as the hyperloop, and with good reason. Promises of high speeds and low costs could mean a revolution in transportation, an area in sore need of modernization in the U.S. But that optimism must be tempered — at least temporarily — until it is proven that the technology can work as promised.</p>
<p>The potential of a hyperloop system, according to studies by groups like the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission and the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency, is remarkable.</p>
<p>The hyper-fast pneumatic tube technology could feasibly carry passengers from Pittsburgh to Columbus, Ohio, in about 20 minutes for $33, and from Pittsburgh to Chicago in about 56 minutes for just $93. It has been estimated that the Pittsburgh-Columbus-Chicago route could create more than 900,000 jobs and $47.6 billion in increased income.</p>
<p>These are staggering numbers, indicative of the excitement and potential of a hyperloop system. But there are still significant logistical and technical hurdles that must be met before those numbers can become a reality.</p>
<p>There are legal and regulatory issues that must be solved, such as securing rights-of-way. But the more pressing concerns are technical. Hyperloop is still an unproven technology that has never been tested in real-world conditions. It is unclear if human passengers could even use the system due to the extreme speeds and G-force that would be exerted on them. And, if construction costs run higher than expected, as many economists and transportation experts expect, the promise of affordable travel could dissipate.</p>
<p>Hyperloop may still revolutionize transportation as we know it. The promise of day-trips between Pittsburgh and Chicago for under $100 is remarkable, and the potential for an economic boon is enormous. It is deserving of research, investment and excitement.</p>
<p>But before cities, regions and entire states bank on hyperloop, the technology must prove itself.</p>
