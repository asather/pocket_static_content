<h1>Hazelwood Green lands tenant promising an 'innovation hub'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former locomotive roundhouse in Hazelwood soon will become a hub of a different sort — for startups, corporations, and others.</p>
<p>Global Silicon Valley, better know as GSVlabs, announced Tuesday that it has signed a long-term lease to locate in the Hazelwood Green development on the Monongahela riverfront.</p>
<p>GSVlabs will make Pittsburgh its next innovation hub. It will be taking space in the old roundhouse building, which is being redeveloped collaborative work and event space.</p>
<p>The company plans to open the state-of-the-art innovation hub in the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Landing GSVlabs is a big win for Almono LP, the partnership that owns the sprawling 178-acre former LTV Coke Works site.</p>
<p>“We are extremely excited to bring GSVlabs to Pittsburgh, as we continue to expand our footprint not just with our global online platform, but in supporting emerging innovation markets around the world with our Innovation Centers,” said Nikhil Sinha, CEO of GSVlabs, in the official announcement.</p>
<p>“We see huge potential in Pittsburgh's rapidly growing market of entrepreneurial and startup activity, with its expanding network of unprecedented university talent and engineering, AI, and data science expertise. It’s an exciting time to be part of Almono’s vision to build the nation's next innovation hub in Pittsburgh.”</p>
