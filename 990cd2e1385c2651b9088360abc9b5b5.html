<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 05.04.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Oh, hey, didn’t see you there. Welcome to my chat. We can talk about the Steelers, but not much has changed since last week, so feel free to get weird if you want.</p>
<p><strong>Questfor7</strong>: I see a lot of people complain about picking a RB in the fourth. I hear a lot of people comparing him to to Dri Archer and Chris Rainey. They were both 5’8” 180 lbs. Little dudes. MacFarland Jr is 5’9” 208 - nearly 30 lbs heavier. Much closer to Alvin Kamara (5’10” 215). He breaks tackles, he’s fast and I think he could be an every down back. I look forward to watching him take it to the house a few times this year. I love the value in the fourth. What’s your take on AM Jr? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I didn’t like the pick for a number of reasons, but you make a good point about his size. The comparisons to Archer, Rainey and even Kerrith Whyte aren’t quite apples to apples. But still, the Steelers need to find a way to get a little bit more out of him right away, even if they do think he could eventually be a feature back. It’ll be interesting to see if he can break NFL tackles on first contact rather than get swallowed up immediately at his size.</p>
<p><strong>Scotty</strong>: With the drafting of Claypool and barring injuries, do you think Switzer will be on team if and when the season starts? I think Cain can contribute more than Switzer. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Could see that going either way, Scotty, but that’s a boring answer and what good am I if I don’t take a stance in these chats? So I’ll flip a coin and say he ends up being the odd man out if they keep five, if only because both JuJu and Diontae Johnson can play in the slot, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Brett</strong>: Hi Brian. Not meant to be a serious question, which Steeler would you like to see make a position switch just because it would be fun to see? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Non-serious questions are ideal, Brett. It’s May 4, people! I’ll pick a new Steeler here and say I’d like to see Derek Watt at linebacker. You can see it in his special teams work. He was recruited as one and started his career there at Wisconsin before they realized he could block the snot out of people at fullback.</p>
<p><strong>Tampa Too</strong>: Saddened to hear of the death of Don Shula. He was one of the greats <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Before my time, but yes, RIP.</p>
<p><strong>Bob</strong>: There sure seems to be a lot of articles about JuJu leaving after this season. Is he unhappy, is it about money or it is just click bait? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Click bait, basically. It’s worth having a discussion and even writing about whether JuJu is in the long-term plans, but just because a reporter somewhere predicts that a player won’t be here in 2021 doesn’t make it a headline. Just my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>NYCJOHN</strong>: I feel like over the offseason our team has only gotten stronger, especially on offense but the one place I’m not so sure about is linebacker. How do you think we’ll change the defense to more one inside linebacker formations? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I feel like there are a few things they could do. Maybe play some 3-3-5 nickel if you like your defensive line makeup. Or just play more dime, bringing in that dime linebacker. Or if you want to get really creative, three outside linebackers in there if you like the way Alex Highsmith is coming along? Dropping into coverage isn’t Bud Dupree or T.J. Watt’s strong suit, of course, but it could allow you to disguise some different things.</p>
<p><strong>Sunner in the sunshine</strong>: Hey Brian! Any kicking of the tires on UFA’s for middle LB? Seems to be the only gaping hole with no depth.(although Punter/Berry needs to be addressed too!) <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not that I’m aware of. As I wrote in my mailbag last week, there aren’t many out there who would be good fits, at least not on paper <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/30/steelers-mailbag-inside-linebackers-2020-team-needs-devin-bush-antoine-brooks/stories/202004300147" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/30/steelers-mailb...</a></p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Thankfully, all the talk about Winston coming to the Steelers ended when the Saints signed him. Now, there had been some talk about Newton coming to the ‘burg. Maybe Bradshaw will come out of retirement. Unbelievable!!! Stop the madness.! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: My biggest issue with signing Cam Newton would be having to decipher the font he uses on social media. If you’ve ever seen it, you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Richard</strong>: Without a preventative vaccine shot this fall, would you sit in a crowd at a Steelers game? Assume you would not be able to avoid close contact with others. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think it would be hilarious if fans aren’t allowed at the games but then us beat writers scatter about a 60,000-seat stadium with our laptops and a beer to write about them.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio Steel</strong>: Didn’t Rudolph have a winning record in his first and only time as a starting NFL QB. Without going into the season expecting to play. Weren’t both Aikman and P. Manning big losers in their first seasons. If either of them played in Pitt they would have been chased out of town. Your thoughts?? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, that’s kind of what I’ve been saying. Mason Rudolph looked really bad at times last year, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t get this rush to jump to the conclusion that he won’t improve. He might never become an NFL starter or even a guy you’re comfortable with as your backup, but I do think it’s too early to tell.</p>
<p><strong>pozone</strong>: Do you see the Steelers picking up a couple FA like LB Kendricks? Anything to the A Rodgers rumors? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well, Mychal Kendricks has played most of his career in a 4-3 scheme, is coming off a torn ACL in December and will soon go to trial facing 25 years for insider trading. I think I’d rather have Aaron Rodgers.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: What’s the under/over, or likeliness - of JJ joining TJ and Derek next season. I’d say Bud for JJ would be an even swap - the wattage at Heinz would be incomparable, and al least unparalleled - well, possibly never before seen, under this wattage <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That’d be off the charts. Not sure I can see it, though. The Texans should do every single thing in their power to keep an icon like him in Houston. Plus he gets paid a ton of money and the Steelers are pretty set at DE with Cam Heyward and Stephon Tuitt.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Brian...what did you think about the virtual draft? Since next year’s draft is scheduled for Cleveland, I think we should just have another virtual draft so nobody will have to go there. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Whether it was to be held in Cleveland or Bora Bora, I agree. Don’t really understand the draft as an in-person event to begin with. I love drafts and am something of a draft nerd whether it’s the NFL, NBA, sometimes even MLB, but 2020 showed us it can be enjoyed just the same with everyone sitting around at home.</p>
<p><strong>Tom88</strong>: What does the the future of J.T. Barrett hold with the Steelers? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Battling for the No. 3 QB spot and if that fails, hoping to stay on the practice squad. Doesn’t hurt to have a Lamar Jackson stand-in there, especially now that rosters/p squad spots will expand.</p>
<p><strong>Higley</strong>: Considering how the draft played out , Why don’t the Steelers try to trade one of their running backs or receivers for an inside linebacker? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Maybe they will. The old days of being trade-averse no longer line up with the 2019 wheeler-dealer Steelers. But you gotta realize how devalued RBs are these days, and now a bunch of teams just replenished their WR depth charts with a great draft class at that position.</p>
<p><strong>ALB</strong>: Do you think the Steelers actually went after both Winston and Dalton? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Mtsteel</strong>: Hi Brian and thanks. So after seeing that contract Winston got from the Saints, it seems like something the Steelers really should have considered. He got 1.1 mil. I mean we can def afford that, at the mere risk of cutting one of our back ups and possible soomeone to have around until you find Ben’s replacement. Your thoughts? Thanks again <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: At that price, it’s hard to argue. I mean, the dude’s practically playing for free. Still, it’d be a distraction of sorts that might not be worth the upgrade. There’s a big difference in being one year away and learning behind Drew Brees versus coming here where Ben Roethlisberger still has two years left on his deal.</p>
<p><strong>steelmann58</strong>: HI Brian what do you see as the steelers biggest need after the Draft? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Punter</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Hi Brian. If the Steelers play before no fans, wouldn’t there be a local TV blackout? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No I don’t think that would happen.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Hi Brian...in the scenario where leagues may be playing with no fans in the stands, I think a lot of players would struggle with how odd it feels. Do you think they would allow artificial crowd noise to be piped in, provided it stayed below a certain decibel level? Would give the players at least a better sense of the game day feeling. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, they could do that. It gets piped in at practice already. Might make sense for stadiums to do that.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: Will Big Ben be able to build on the sweet, sweet 3 points he scorched the Pats with in last year’s opener? Or should the bar realistically be set lower? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Let’s see who they get in the opener first.</p>
<p><strong>BSTEELER3</strong>: Who do you think will be the #3 Safety week one? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Jordan Dangerfield</p>
<p><strong>Ken K</strong>: Do you think the Steelers will sign a starting caliber inside linebacker that is more athletic than Vince Williams, such as Nigel Bradham? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, not at this point as I scan the options out there.</p>
<p><strong>Lou</strong>: Hi Brian. Fans out there keep talking <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I know, Lou, it never ends</p>
<p><strong>Lou</strong>: Hi Brian. What’s the chance that Juju is gone after this season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: To me it’s 50-50. On one hand, you just drafted a potential No. 1 receiver and you’ve still got James Washington and Diontae Johnson in the pipeline. But on the other, what if JuJu has a huge bounce-back season? He’s been productive more often than not in the NFL and he’s always been good as long as Ben Roethlisberger is throwing to him. As for the money it’ll take, would you rather have Bud Dupree long term or JuJu Smith-Schuster? I think I’d choose JuJu if it was an either/or.</p>
<p><strong>WyoBowhunter</strong>: Brian, do you feel that in this QB driven league, Ben has to perform the best in order to Make a championship run? Or can the defense contain things with Ben at the helm? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He’s still good enough to win a Super Bowl as your QB, but this Steelers defense might also be good enough to win one without Ben putting the team on his back. So to answer your question, no, I don’t think he needs to throw for 300-plus yards and three touchdowns on the regular for the Steelers to go all the way. Gonna need a much better running game, though.</p>
<p><strong>Richard</strong>: Again, would you sit in a crowd at a Steeler game prior to having a virus vaccination? Serious question - prefer a serious and thoughtful answer. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: As long as my wife approves, yes. That’s about as serious and thoughtful as I can be.</p>
<p><strong>Steelers22</strong>: RIP Don Shula! Did you know Shula had recommended Chuck Noll to the Rooneys? Shula had known Noll since his college days and hired him as an assistant coach when he (Shula) was still head coach of the Baltimore Colts. Shula was quoted as saying Noll “knew everything about everything.” <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, I did not know that. But I was aware that Noll indeed knew a lot about a lot of things, if not everything about everything.</p>
<p><strong>steelmann58</strong>: Hi Brian just a follow up the UDFA they signed out of South Alabama any good i know he a left footed punter. I was a bit suprised they did not try to get someone better <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well he was all set to be Mississippi State’s punter after grad transferring there in 2019, but then the NCAA denied him an extra year of eligibility. So perhaps the Steelers found a diamond in the rough from scouting his pre-draft process. Regardless, he’s a left-footed punter born in Belgium with a cool name. Sign me up for Corliss Waitman, baby!</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: If the steelers bring back the wild cat, could they eliminate the double dribble play! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: If they bring back the wildcat, they should activate JT Barrett from the p squad on game days.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio Steel</strong>: Did Slippery Rock’s Roland Rivers get picked up as an undrafted rookie by anyone? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not that I’ve seen. Pretty interesting though. Winner of the Harlon Hill Trophy, the D2 Heisman. Someone should take a shot on him.</p>
<p><strong>TomnIsolation</strong>: Do you know when jersey numbers are assigned to new Steelers? Is it different for Draftees and UDFA? Thanks B.B! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Normally, we’d know very soon once OTAs start, but maybe it’ll take longer this year. Anyway, Chase Claypool already said he’s wearing 11. I think there are websites out there that predict which numbers each rookie will wear. Yes, I’m serious. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: OK folks we’re up against it. See you back here next week, same time, same channel.</p>
