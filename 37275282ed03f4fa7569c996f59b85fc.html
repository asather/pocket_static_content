<p>WASHINGTON — After making more than eight hours of arguments on Wednesday, House Democrats on Thursday will continue to make a case before the U.S. Senate for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>On the second day of arguments, the House managers are expected to delve into Constitutional law to explain why President Donald Trump’s actions warrant his removal from office.</p>
<p>The session, set to begin at 1 p.m., will build on Wednesday arguments in which Democrats made their claim that Mr. Trump abused his power in pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s arguments painted a scathing picture, using video and texts among Trump administration officials who were alarmed about the president’s directives.</p>
<p>Six House&nbsp;impeachment managers, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chair of the House Intelligence Committee, are allowed two more eight-hour sessions, held on&nbsp;Thursday and Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are seeking to&nbsp;convince senators that Mr. Trump abused his power by freezing nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine and withholding a coveted White House meeting in exchange for that country announcing an investigation into Mr. Biden, who is challenging Mr. Trump in this year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>This is the third impeachment trial in U.S. history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how events are unfolding today:</p>
<p><em><strong>Updated at 1:45 p.m.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>President Trump tweets</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Updated at 1:21 p.m.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Democrats expected to use eight hours today to make their case</strong></p>
<p>House Democrats have a remaining 16 hours and 42 minutes — by the tally of Chief Justice John Roberts — to present their case for the removal of President Trump.</p>
<p>A day after presenting a timeline of Mr. Trump’s actions to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival, the six House managers plan to argue impeachment is warranted by the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>“All of the legal experts who testified before the House Judiciary Committee ... agreed the conduct we charged constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors,” Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., told the senator. Mr. Nadler, chair of the committee, held a public hearing to discuss the Constitutional grounds for impeachment.</p>
<p>The Democrats’ arguments are expected to last about eight hours today and another eight hours tomorrow.</p>
<p>As every afternoon, Thursday’s trial session began with the calm baritone of Senate Chaplain Barry C. Black.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Mr. Black prayed that senators “may they strive to have a clear conscience in whatever they do.”</p>
<p>“Lord, help them remember that listening is often more than hearing,” he went on. “It can be an empathetic attentiveness that builds bridges and unites. May our senators not permit fatigue or cynicism to jeopardize friendships that have existed for years.”</p>
