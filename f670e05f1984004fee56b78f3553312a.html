<h1>Allderdice girls overcome sloppy start to claim third consecutive City League crown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It wasn’t the type of dominating performance Allderdice has grown accustomed to, but the result was all the same.</p>
<p>The Dragons’ girls basketball team used its suffocating defense to grind out a 57-36 win against Westinghouse in the City League championship game at Petersen Events Center on Saturday afternoon. The win gave Allderdice (22-2) its third consecutive City League championship.</p>
<p>Sophia North led all scorers with 15 points for the Dragons, while fellow seniors Emma Waite and Nautica Burwell added 12 and 11, respectively.</p>
<p>Despite making its fourth consecutive appearance in the title game, Allderdice appeared to be dealing with some jitters early on. The Dragons started the game 0 for 8 from the field, but their defense kept the Bulldogs off the board as well.</p>
<p>Once their nerves settled down, each of Allderdice’s starters got involved in the scoring. All five starters made a field goal before anyone made a second basket. North then made a fastbreak layup off a steal while drawing a foul to put the Dragons up 16-2, and they took a 22-6 lead into the second quarter.</p>
<p>Allderdice’s offense went ice cold in the second, scoring only two points in the quarter, and Westinghouse began chipping away at the Dragons’ lead. Allderdice went more than seven minutes without scoring a point during the second and third quarters, but the Dragons began to find their rhythm again after the break.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs refused to go away quietly, but they couldn’t quite cut the deficit to single digits. Eventually, Allderdice pulled away late in the fourth quarter to lock up the three-peat.</p>
