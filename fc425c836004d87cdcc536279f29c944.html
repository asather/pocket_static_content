<h1>Contact sheets are 'proof' of photographers' mastery in Cleveland show </h1>

<p>CLEVELAND — Before digital cameras became common in the 1990s, photographers chose their best pictures by developing film in a dark room, then looking at a contact sheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically a single piece of paper with a dozen small images, a contact sheet is a series of visual rough drafts that show how a photographer works. Between the 1940s and early 1990s, job-hunting photographers were often required to submit contact sheets with finished prints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“PROOF: Photography in the Era of the Contact Sheet” is a free exhibition that runs through Nov. 29 at the Cleveland Museum of Art. The show is a portal into the minds of some of the world’s best-known photographers, including Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Sir Cecil Beaton, Robert Frank, Philippe Halsman and Irving Penn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organized by Peter Galassi, former chief curator of photography at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, this exhibition is an engrossing stroll through 20th century American life and visual culture. The silver gelatin prints and contact sheets are from the collection of the late Mark Schwartz and his widow, Bettina Katz, of Cleveland.</p>
<p>Labels often identify which picture was chosen; visitors can study the contact sheets to see differences and similarities. The show, well worth the two-and-a-half hour drive, also demonstrates how photography in media elevated actors, artists, musicians, pundits and writers to stardom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Beatles engage in a pillow fight in “The Beatles Times 9.” Posing for a Life magazine cover, Marilyn Monroe is the soul of seduction in a form-fitting dress with bare shoulders, parted lips and eyes at half mast. William F. Buckley Jr., founder of The National Review, talks and smokes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Richard Avedon’s portrait of Groucho Marx in his 80s is a far different view of the fast-talking actor, comedian and game show host best known for his exaggerated eyebrows and ever-present cigar. No longer a performer, his pensive face is serene. By contrast, images of Woody Allen show the filmmaker costumed as Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx and Charlie Chaplin, an amusing visual trifecta.</p>
<p>Photographers are hunters with lenses and the best are skilled at staking out positions while narrowing the field of choices. The exhibition explores hunting, choosing and cropping the image.</p>
<p>Cropping is demonstrated effectively by showing the wide view Bob Jackson snapped of Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas on Nov. 24, 1963. A cropped version dramatizes the pain on Oswald’s face and underscores how close Ruby got to the man accused of assassinating President John F. Kennedy two days earlier.</p>
<p>An oversized contact sheet with pictures of playwright Tennessee Williams opens the gallery devoted to fame. The author of “A Streetcar Named Desire” wears a suit and bow tie and holds drink and cigarette in hand, epitomizing the bonhomie of the bar that he often enjoyed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naked from the waist up, actress Sharon Tate and her husband, Roman Polanski, wrap their arms around each other. David Bailey made the photograph in January 1969; Tate was murdered in August of that year. A publicity photo for Sean Connery playing James Bond in the movie “Dr. No” shows him pointing a gun in a variety of ways.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>One gallery is devoted to pictures of photographers. An especially fine pairing shows Sir Cecil Beaton, an English photographer and Tony Award-winning costume designer, with Rudolf Nureyev, the charismatic Russian dancer with the mesmerizing smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of Irving Penn’s best pictures is “12 Hands of Miles Davis and His Trumpet.” The contact sheet shows the jazz musician’s hands holding the trumpet in different positions.&nbsp;Penn also photographed Jean Patchett, a highly sought after fashion model who he called “a young American goddess of Paris couture.”</p>
<p>Many celebrity interviews are broadcast but few capture the personalities of their subjects as well as the memorable series of still photos Clifford Coffin made in 1950 while Patchett talked for hours with Ernest Hemingway during a shoot for Vogue magazine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stretched out on his sofa at his Key West home in Florida, the bare-chested and barefoot author appears to be the master of his universe. But his paunchy belly contrasts with the trim figure of Patchett, who said later that Hemingway “smelled bad.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last gallery,&nbsp;“Array,” displays a few 19th century photographs by Eadweard Muybridge, the widely influential English photographer who used his cameras to study motion in animals and human beings.</p>
<p>Another historic jewel in this gallery is an uncut sheet of eight portraits of “Monsieur Merlen.”&nbsp; Andre-Adolphe-Eugene-Disderi, a French photographer who made the images, invented the&nbsp;“carte de visite” and patented it in 1854. Afterward, Parisians and Americans went wild for the portraits and photographers all over the world copied the technique.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
