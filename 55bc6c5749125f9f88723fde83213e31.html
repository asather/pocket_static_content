<h1>How Washington County's Southminster Place care home handled COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As anxiety about COVID-19 spiked across the nation, administrators at Southminster Place understood they could find themselves on the pandemic’s front lines.</p>
<p>With a highly vulnerable population — 47 residents whose age averaged 82 years old — the Washington County personal care community in South Strabane appreciated that an outbreak could prove devastating.</p>

<p>But awareness isn’t a shield, and last week what would be any administrator’s nightmare came true when an employee, and later a resident, tested positive for the novel coronavirus, a potentially catastrophic situation for a facility catering to senior citizens.</p>
<p>So far, though, a catastrophe hasn’t materialized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Southminster’s parent outfit, Presbyterian SeniorCare Network, with operations in 10 Pennsylvania counties, hopes that the measures it took, including widespread testing at the facility, aggressive screening procedures and dutifully following advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will protect it from the kinds of calamities that have struck nursing and personal care homes elsewhere.</p>
<p>Facilities&nbsp;in California, New Jersey, the state of Washington and West Virginia have been ravaged by COVID-19, and so have places closer to home, such as Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County, Allegheny County’s Kane Center facility in Glen Hazel and Ligonier Gardens in Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>Where the contagion has spread mercilessly in those locations, Southminster Place, at least for the time being, has been spared. On Thursday the final COVID-19 test results came back for the last of the center’s residents — all negative, except for the one who tested positive. Also negative were the eight employees tested after contact tracing revealed that they had potentially been exposed to the infected worker.</p>
<p>How Southminster Place responded to the contagion provides a look in microcosm at one congregate care center’s approach to managing an unprecedented crisis.</p>
<p>On Thursday, April 2, a personal care aide who had worked at Southminster Place for four years called off.</p>
<p>By then, the facility had instituted screening procedures for its 45 employees. The network limited the number of entrances used at each facility to between one and three, depending on the size. Tape was used to mark distances six feet apart so employees waiting to get in knew where to line up while maintaining social distancing.</p>
<p>Starting around March 2, screening procedures were put into place. Temperature checks and mask usage by trained screeners began March 15. Based on the results, staff members were either let in or sent home. On March 13, a strict no-visitors policy took effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dealing with an infectious disease wasn’t a novel experience for the health network, which has 56 care communities throughout Western Pennsylvania, 2,000 employees and about 6,500 older adults it cares for at their homes and in community-based facilities. Every year, they grapple with the flu, for instance.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if there’s an appreciation that in settings like ours there’s already a lot of protocols and procedures with regard to infection control and how you elevate those levels of infection control based on circumstances,” said Lisa Fischetti, the network’s spokeswoman.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With COVID-19 — what Ms. Fischetti called “this crazy virus” —&nbsp;it was the same idea. But it was, of course, also different.</p>
<p>More contagious than the flu, deadlier than the flu, not as well understood as the flu. No widespread immunity. No vaccine.</p>
<p>As a result, the guidance from the state and federal health authorities remained in flux as the knowledge base about the virus grew and changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Everybody is continuing to update what they’re doing. And so it feels as if we’re getting updated guidance from federal, state and local authorities, it feels almost like daily. Because everybody is learning as we go along, and that’s what makes this so different,” Ms. Fischetti said.&nbsp;“We are ratcheting everything so way up and we’re doing it in such real time, because as soon as the guidance is out there, we have to figure out how that gets implemented over our network of communities:”</p>
<p>The state Department of Health has facilities like Southminster — what are called congregate care homes — at the top of its priority list because of their exceedingly vulnerable populations and communal living arrangements. As of Friday, according to the department, there were 1,209 COVID-19 cases at 181 long-term care facilities in Pennsylvania, or 6% of the state’s 19,979 cases.</p>
<p>“When an infectious disease occurs in a congregate care facility, there are significant concerns as to how quickly it can spread among both residents and employees,” Nate Wardle, a health department spokesman, said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The department is working with our long-term care facilities to assist them, particularly those with outbreaks and with significant areas of concern, which includes staffing issues,” Mr. Wardle said.&nbsp;“We have been working to push personal protective equipment to all of our long-term care facilities in Pennsylvania and sent that equipment to all facilities as of April 3. We have also been in constant communication with facilities of concern to assist them and check to see what potential needs they have.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 1, the aide who would test positive for COVID-19 worked a last shift. By the next day, events were in motion that would flag that employee to Southminster management.&nbsp;But it wasn’t the screening procedures that raised a warning. It was another tool deployed to monitor for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“In addition to those screening procedures, we are keeping track centrally of absences in a way that we normally wouldn’t, so if somebody calls off, now we have every day at 4 o’clock all of our communities providing their HR rep with a special form created called our ‘absence tracker,’ and on that absence tracker they will tell us whoever called off for the day as well as whoever was sent home as a result of not passing our screening protocols," Ms. Fischetti said.</p>
<p>The human relations folks review the tracker with a clinical team. If someone calls off and no one knows why, there is a follow-up, since the reason could point to COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p>On Friday, April 3,&nbsp;both Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and the CDC issued guidance for the public to wear masks.</p>
<p>Southminster had a grid in place with guidelines for which staff members should get what protective equipment — N95 masks, face shields, gowns and gloves — in an effort to preserve the coveted gear for necessary occasions. Ms. Fischetti, for example, as someone who works in an office, practices social distancing and wears a bandanna when needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At that point in time in our journey we were having masking in place by certain roles but not by every team member,“ Ms. Fischetti said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That would change.</p>
<p>Late the next day, April 4, the employee’s test results came back positive. And Southminster, based on the state and federal guidance, broadened its masking protocols.</p>
<p>“Was every housekeeper masked? Was every maintenance person masked? That wasn’t the case,” Ms. Fischetti said. “Was that the case since Monday of this week? Absolutely.”</p>
<p>With a positive result in hand, Southminster moved to work backward and determine who might have been potentially exposed to the infected employee during the 48 hours before the employee’s last shift.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question was simple, as Ms. Fischetti explained: “Where did their shift take them?”</p>
<p>In a stroke of luck, the aide had a regular assignment and wasn’t a floater or assigned to multiple areas. Southminster spoke with the infected employee and asked about possible exposures. Schedules were checked, And the facility came up with eight employees who should be tested.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, efforts were underway to locate a laboratory that could deliver a turnaround for test results within 48 hours. One was found, and testing commenced Monday. But not just for the eight workers. Administrators were cognizant that the infected aide was ill before the new masking protocols took effect. And so they decided to err on the side of safety.</p>
<p>“We had our direct care workers already in our clinical roles wearing masks as appropriate, but we didn’t have every employee masked as we do now. When we described that to our CEO ... our CEO said because everybody in the whole community was not masked, instead of trying to figure out how many more people those eight people might have been in contact with, let’s just out of an abundance of caution test all of our residents.”</p>
<p>On Saturday night, April 4, Southminster staffers dialed residents’ families to explain the situation. A Presbyterian SeniorCare Network medical director wrote out testing orders for all the residents. And on Monday, the lab came to the facility to administer the tests. Employees who needed to be tested but were off that day traveled to Southminster, too, and were tested in a drive-through setting.</p>
<p>Two days later, the results began coming in. One positive. But that was it. The rest were good news: Negative. Negative. Negative.</p>
<p>Ms. Fischetti kept tabs, compiling the data. By late Wednesday night, she was exhausted and her bed was calling. She knew all the employees had tested negative, and all but one result had come back negative for the residents. She couldn’t stay up any longer waiting for the last result and sent out a news release just before 11 p.m. The next day, results for the final resident tested came back: Negative.</p>
<p>It seemed that Southminster had dodged a bullet.</p>
<p>Said CEO&nbsp;Paul Winkler. “While even one positive resident case is one too many, we are grateful that it appears that the exposure has been limited at Southminster Place.”</p>
<p>Kristin Henderson, senior director of clinical services, noted Presbyterian SeniorCare’s proactive posture in addressing the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Since the start of this pandemic, we have been aggressive about implementing network-wide precautionary measures and restrictions in accordance with federal, state and local guidance,” she said. “And we have been constantly updating and adjusting our protocols and procedures as the guidance and learnings have continued to evolve.”</p>
<p>Whether Southminster’s negative results hold remains to be seen. Network administrators understand that the virus has an incubation period as long as 14 days, so residents and employees who were asymptomatic last week and tested negative could in theory show a positive result during a later round of testing.</p>
<p>“A negative test is a negative test for that time period, but may not necessarily mean the individual does not have COVID-19,” the health department’s Mr. Wardle said. “A later test a week later might be positive.”</p>
<p>Ms. Fischetti said she did not know if there were plans for another round of testing for all Southminster residents or proactive testing throughout the entire SeniorCare network.</p>
<p>But at the least, according to Susan V. Dachille, the network’s vice president of quality and risk, focused testing is continuing at the South Strabane location as a result of the resident’s positive result.</p>
