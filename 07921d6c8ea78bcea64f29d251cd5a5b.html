<h1>Amid a pandemic, a $130 million office development is proposed in Moon Township</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One developer isn’t letting a pandemic interfere with its plans to build a $130 million office complex in Moon Township.</p>
<p>The Burns Scalo real estate firm announced that it is ready to move ahead with Diamond Ridge, a three-building development featuring more than 500,000 square feet of office space on 41 acres of land off the Parkway West.</p>
<p>Burns Scalo paid $8 million in December to acquire the land from Chevron, the California energy giant that once had plans to build a regional headquarters at the site.&nbsp;Also included in the purchase were three acres used for the former Gander Mountain Store on MarketPlace Boulevard.</p>
<p>The developer is pitching its plan at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has upended the real estate world and brought many construction projects to a halt in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>But James Scalo, the company’s president and CEO, is banking on the office market returning stronger than ever once the crisis subsides and people are allowed to return to their desks.</p>
<p>“If we’ve learned anything from this pandemic, it’s that working from home doesn’t work,” he said.</p>
<p>“Americans are going to rush back to work and that will create demand for more office space, not less, when the crisis ends as more spatial seating in lobby areas and the office space become common.”</p>
<p>Some real estate experts believe the aftermath of the pandemic could increase the need for more space, even if some employees continue to work from home.&nbsp;The reason is social distancing. Companies may want to keep their workers at least six feet apart rather than having them sit side by side or in groups.</p>
<p>To Burns Scalo, that presents an opportunity,” Mr. Scalo said.&nbsp;“Future tenants will have the coronavirus in mind, and new properties will reflect that shift in tenant priorities,” he said.</p>
<p>At one time, the future home of Diamond Ridge was to be the regional headquarters for Chevron during a period when oil and gas companies were ramping up Marcellus Shale work in the region.</p>
<p>But Chevron announced in 2014 that it was delaying a “final investment decision on the proposed office project” for the foreseeable future and then ended up scrapping the development altogether.</p>
<p>In all, it had acquired 61 acres for the campus, including a former Kmart site that it still owns, for more than $17 million.</p>
<p>The plan called for a new corporate campus that would have included a 44,250-square-foot one-story building with a laboratory as well as a second-phase regional headquarters with a multi-story office building, a smaller commons building, and a 1,200-car parking garage.</p>
<p>Burns Scalo has expressed some interest in possibly acquiring the rest of the old Chevron site, but has yet to make that move.</p>
<p>It hopes to break ground on Diamond Ridge later this year, but gave no specific timetable for doing so in its announcement regarding the project.</p>
<p>The project isn’t the only one the company is doing in the Parkway West corridor.&nbsp;Earlier this week, it got approval from the state to resume construction on the Boardwalk, a two-building, 220,000-square-foot complex in North Fayette.</p>
<p>Burns Scalo already has landed ConnectiveRx, a company that works with biopharmaceutical manufacturers to help commercialize and maximize the benefits of branded and specialty medications, to take all 106,000 square feet in one of the buildings.</p>
<p>“We continue to see a great demand for new building to be built in the Parkway West,” Mr. Scalo said.</p>
