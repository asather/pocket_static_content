<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>West Virginia University has decided to extend remote-only instruction through the summer and has canceled events including athletic and other summer camps scheduled for June, President E. Gordon Gee told campus Wednesday.</p>
<p>New student orientation, typically held in person in June, also is moving online amid ongoing health threats posed by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Mr. Gee praised efforts to date across the 30,000-student university, but said more efforts will be needed to curb the virus spread.</p>
<p>“And as the pandemic continues to carve a path of uncertainty, the safety of our campus community remains our utmost priority,” Mr. Gee <a href="https://wvutoday.wvu.edu/stories/2020/04/08/no-in-person-classes-through-summer-gee-announces-in-letter-praising-wvu-community-s-covid-19-response" target="_blank">wrote in a message</a> to students and employees. “Therefore, the University has made the following decisions as the summer months approach.</p>
<p>Also Wednesday, the University of Pittsburgh announced that it has decided to hold a virtual degree conferral for some 8,000 graduates on April 26. The 30-minute ceremony is to take place on the day Pitt had hoped to hold its largest commencement ceremony in the Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>“Pitt remains committed to honoring these graduates with a proper in-person commencement when circumstances permit large gatherings again, but the University community is determined not to let this class’ milestone go unmarked,” the <a href="https://www.commencement.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">university said</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;At WVU, Mr. Gee said specifically that:</p>
<p>● Alternative instruction, meaning no on-campus classes, will be in force through summer term, May 18 through Aug. 7, “with the possible exception of some programming at the Health Sciences Center.” “Maymester,” scheduled for May 11-29, also is canceled;</p>
<p>● The provost will decide what courses can be transitioned to online, and students will be notified of any changes in their course schedules that result;</p>
<p>● The university is canceling all events and camps through June 30, including events sponsored by WVU Extension, as well as on the Beckley and Keyser campuses, though some colleges may convert events to remote delivery;</p>
<p>● Scheduled on-campus, in-person WVU athletic camps in June also will be canceled, among them baseball, football, gymnastics, men’s basketball, men’s soccer, tennis, track, women’s basketball, women’s soccer and wrestling;</p>
<p>●&nbsp;All First-Year Trips also have been canceled for the month of June;</p>
<p>● New Student Orientation program in June will convert to an online event, replacing the on-campus experience that is typically held in the month of June.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, more than 1.4 million cases and about 85,000 deaths have been attributed to the new coronavirus, according to an interactive tracker from Johns Hopkins University The U.S. has the largest number of cases, with 400,000 in total and about 13,000 deaths.</p>
