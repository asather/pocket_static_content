<h1>CheerNotes aims to deliver more diversity to greeting cards</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Asha Banks was frustrated with the lack of diversity in big box stores’ greeting card sections, particularly when it came to people of color.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I always felt like we were missing from the greeting card aisle,” said Ms. Banks, a Harrisburg native. “I also felt like I had to go to certain neighborhoods to even have a chance of finding the limited options that were available.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>While pursuing an MBA at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, Ms. Banks started working on a solution. She called it CheerNotes, an online card company that aims to sell inclusive card designs with authentic expressions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her burgeoning business is one of eight selected this year to participate in the <a href="https://targetaccelerators.com/happenings/news/incubator-2020-cohort/" target="_blank">Target Accelerators’ incubator program</a>, which runs through September. It connects startups like CheerNotes with mentors and leaders from across Target Corp. to help them grow.</p>
<p>The world of greeting cards was new territory for Ms. Banks, who earned her undergraduate degree in chemical engineering and spent seven years in that industry before attending grad school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I started researching the industry to understand what was going on. What was the whole process of even getting your card into a store? And who’s making the cards out there?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>She learned that it’s not easy for an up-and-coming or independent card designer to get shelf space alongside a major card maker. For CheerNotes, Ms. Banks scoured the internet, including websites like Etsy and social media, to look for card designers whose work reflects same-sex couples and people of different shapes, sizes and skin colors. CheerNotes purchases cards from these designers wholesale to sell on its website,&nbsp;<a href="https://cheernotes.com/" target="_blank">cheernotes.com</a>.</p>
<p>After picking out a card, customers can provide a message that will be printed in it and mailed out on their behalf. For those who’d prefer to sign, seal and deliver the card themselves, CheerNotes will ship the blank cards to them.</p>
<p>Since its soft launch in January, the business has been well-received, Ms. Banks said. One of her favorite card designs shows two eyebrows — one bushy and one thin — that reads&nbsp;“thanks for being there through thick and thin” by designer Krisa Tailor of Pyarful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s one that people are attracted to,” she said.&nbsp;“I’ve had a lot of conversations. Even [for] Millennials and Gen Z, there’s something about having something in your hand, having the message that’s catered specifically to you and took more time than a text or a comment on a [social media] post. That extra effort is appreciated.”</p>
<p>Ms. Banks hopes CheerNotes can help showcase independent card designers, too.</p>
<p>“I wanted to make sure that I wouldn’t be cannibalizing the sales opportunities for artists. I wanted it to be a value for them,” she said.&nbsp;“We always give them credit and that’s cross-marketing for them, as well, because some of them sell other things.”</p>
<p>Ms. Banks has big plans for the future of CheerNotes. In addition to curating creations by card designers, she’s exploring ways to license work by artists to feature on CheerNotes cards. She’s grateful for opportunities like the Target incubator program for helping her learn how to bring these visions to fruition — one birthday, anniversary and holiday at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ultimately, we’re focused on trying to help people nurture their relationships, and I would love to get to a point where we can be part of more moments,” Ms. Banks said.&nbsp;“I think there will always be a place for the handwritten note.”</p>
