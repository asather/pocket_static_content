<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre announced more changes to its 2019-20 performance schedule in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Its engagement at The Joyce Theater in New York City at the end of April has been canceled, and its season closer, “Balanchine + Tchaikovsky,” scheduled for April 17-19 at Downtown’s Benedum Center, has been postponed. The local show would have been the last main stage production of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2019/02/07/Pittsburgh-Ballet-Theatre-50th-anniversary-mainstage-season-2019-20/stories/201902070178" target="_blank">PBT’s 50th anniversary season</a> and the final one under the direction of artistic director Terrence Orr, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2019/06/06/Pittsburgh-Ballet-Theatre-artistic-director-Terrence-Orr-retire-2020-after-22-years/stories/201906060148" target="_blank">who’s slated to retire this summer</a>.</p>
<p>The news came on the heels of PBT postponing its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2020/03/16/Pittsburgh-Ballet-Theatre-Here-Now-Staycee-Pearl-Kyle-Abraham-August-Wilson-Center/stories/202003160003" target="_blank">“Here + Now” mixed repertory program</a> celebrating black choreographers. It originally was slated for March 20-29 at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Downtown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The decision was difficult,” executive director Harris Ferris said in a statement, “but we know it is in the best interest of our community right now, and we hope to bring all these works to the stage in the future.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBT representatives will contact ticket holders for these Pittsburgh performances and ask that people refrain from calling the box office. The company also is exploring alternative programming options and ways to distribute digital content to audiences to round out its season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre School also has canceled classes through May 3. The school is in the process of creating remote learning opportunities until in-person classes can resume.&nbsp;</p>
