<h1>DA withdraws charges against 5 in Homewood vigil attack</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County District Attorney's office on Friday withdrew aggravated assault and other charges against five co-defendants charged with shooting two children and an adult at a 2015 vigil in Homewood.</p>
<p>The withdrawal comes just 10 days before jury selection was scheduled in the case — and a day after a status conference in which defense attorneys demanded information from the DA's office about a man known as Witness No. 3, who was cooperating in the case — and who was supposed to have cooperated in the Wilkinsburg mass shooting case, as well.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in the Wilkinsburg case decided just four days before the capital case was slated to begin on Feb. 3 to not call Witness No. 3 — amid allegations of discovery violations by defense attorneys who had just learned the witness received financial consideration by county police which had never been revealed.</p>
<p>That decision led Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowksi to dismiss charges against one of the accused Wilkinsburg killers, Robert Thomas, the day the trial began.</p>
<p>His co-defendant, Cheron Shelton, went to trial and was acquitted of all charges.</p>
<p>In the Homewood vigil case, scheduled for jury selection on March 9, Assistant District Attorney Russ Broman wrote on the forms withdrawing charges: "Due to the murder of a commonwealth witness, subsequent lack of cooperation of witness and other evidentiary issues, the commonwealth is unable to proceed at this time."</p>
<p>Judge Borkowski, who was also assigned the vigil case, signed the forms Friday morning.</p>
<p>Defense attorney Patrick Nightingale, who represents Ronald Dotson in the vigil shooting, said he did not know the charges were being withdrawn until after it happened.</p>
<p>"I am absolutely unaware of any alleged murdered witnesses," Mr. Nightingale said. "What I am aware of is the only witness who placed my client at the shooting admitted, himself, to a homicide.”</p>
<p>Defense attorney Casey White, who represents Demetres Beck in the vigil shooting — whose case was not withdrawn — previously said in court that he has seen a video recording from March 2018 in which Witness No. 3 admits his involvement in the death of 15-month-old Marcus L. White Jr., who was shot and killed during a family picnic in East Hills on May 21, 2013.</p>
<p>The vigil shooting occurred on Sept. 16, 2015, on Monticello Street and injured a 49-year-old woman, a 12-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy.</p>
<p>Charges were filed through a combination of criminal complaints and grand jury indictments.</p>
<p>At Thursday’s status conference on the vigil shooting, Mr. Nightingale requested a pretrial hearing in which he would be permitted to question the two prosecutors on the WIlkinsburg case, Deputy District Attorney Kevin Chernosky and Assistant District Attorney Lisa Pellegrini about why they chose not to call Witness No. 3 in Wilkinsburg.</p>
<p>Their reasons, Mr. Nightingale argued, could have helped the defense attorneys impeach Witness No. 3 in their own case.</p>
<p>"In our opinion, that witness clearly has severe credibility issues, and that is the basis of this nolle pros — and not alleged threats to witnesses that have been been communicated to the defense."</p>
<p>Owen Seman, who represents Jamiere Dehonney in the vigil case, wondered, unless the witness was killed after noon on Thursday, why defense attorneys didn’t learn of it at the status conference Thursday.</p>
<p>“I am completely shocked to hear of the . . . murdered witness,” Mr. Seman said. “No one on the defense side has any idea who this is. Who is he referring to?”</p>
