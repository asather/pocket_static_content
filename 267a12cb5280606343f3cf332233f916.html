<h1>Accused major cocaine distributor in Fayette loses appeal, will remain behind bars</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A felon identified by the FBI as the key drug distributor for one of the largest cocaine rings ever prosecuted in this region has failed again to convince a judge that he's not a threat and will remain locked up.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak on Thursday upheld a previous detention order for William Shaw Jr., of Brownsville, saying the government's evidence that he's a drug dealer is strong and that he's a danger to the community.</p>
<p>Shaw is among nearly 40 people indicted in 2017 following an investigation of a ring that shipped huge amounts of cocaine and marijuana cross-country from Los Angeles and Atlanta to Penn Hills.</p>
<p>The network was run by Don Juan Mendoza of Jacksonville, Fla., according to the FBI and state police, who is set to plead guilty on Friday.</p>
<p>His top lieutenants were Jamie Lightfoot Jr., owner of the Penn Hills home, and his brother Deaubre Lightfoot of Monessen. The brothers, who are sons of a convicted Donora drug dealer, have both pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>Shaw was their main distributor in Fayette County where much of the drugs were sold, according to federal agents and police.</p>
<p>A federal magistrate judge in 2018 ordered him detained as a danger but he appealed that ruling and Judge Hornak held another detention hearing earlier this month. He reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Although Shaw's lawyer had said there is "no evidence" that his client was involved in the Mendoza conspiracy, the judge said the Lightfoot pleas and FBI testimony show otherwise.</p>
<p>The Lightfoots were seen on surveillance at Shaw's house, owned by his mother, carrying a bag, and shortly after they left, other ring members arrived. When law officers searched the property they found large wads of cash stuffed into cupholders in the sofa and crack cocaine in the toilet bowl. In addition, the FBI said agents found more than $100,000 in cash in the trunk of Shaw's girlfriend's car parked outside.</p>
<p>Shaw also told agents where they could find an AR-15 assault rifle in a bedroom and cocaine in a bookbag on the couch. Two scales were found in dresser.</p>
<p>Judge Hornak said that evidence has to be taken into consideration with the fact that Shaw, who is in his mid-30s, has never had a consistent job yet has supported himself and others.</p>
<p>The judge also rejected Shaw's contention that third parties could watch over him if were released. At the first hearing, a woman said she could give Shaw a job, but the judge said she and her husband worked at the same time so no one would be around to watch Shaw.</p>
<p>At the second hearing, Shaw said either a friend or his sister-in-law could watch over him. But the judge said the friend lives in Ohio and the sister-in-law is disabled and has a nine-year-old child.</p>
<p>Judge Hornak said Shaw had previously lived, without a job, in a house with "cocaine, bundles of money and a high velocity rifle." He said he won't allow Shaw to now live in a house with a child.</p>
<p>The judge said there are "no conditions that would secure the safety of others and of the community."</p>
<p>A federal wiretap case against him, Mendoza, the Lightfoots and their cohorts came into public view in November 2017 when agents and state troopers tracked an RV on a three-day trip from L.A. to Penn Hills. When it arrived at Lightfoot's house, agents seized it and recovered 52 kilos of cocaine, 85 pounds of marijuana and an AK-47 assault rifle.</p>
<p>Inside Lightfoot's house they confiscated nearly $600,000 in cash.</p>
<p>Police said other drug shipments came from Atlanta in a van imprinted with a gigantic image of Mendoza's wife, a rap performer, wearing a white leotard and brandishing a broadsword.</p>
