<h1>Pitt mailbag: Which players have exceeded or fallen below expectations this season?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Each week through the end of the 2019-20 season, Craig Meyer, the Post-Gazette’s Pitt basketball writer, will answer reader questions about the Panthers. And some other stuff, too.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to submit a question, you can email Craig at cmeyer@post-gazette.com or hit him up on Twitter @CraigMeyerPG.</em></p>
<p><strong>Brandon</strong>: With regular season just about over, which players have played to expectations, below, and exceeded?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Using only the nine rotation players — so not including someone like Onyebuchi Ezeakudo, who has definitely exceeded my expectations — here’s what I’d go with:</p>
<p><em>Exceeded</em></p>
<p>Justin Champagnie: Heard a lot about him in the preseason, but didn’t think he’d be this impactful this early.</p>
<p>Au’Diese Toney: Improved both offensively and defensively, especially the former, and grew to embrace his role on the team and his strengths as a player.</p>
<p><em>Met</em></p>
<p>Terrell Brown: Was very close to putting him in the exceeded category. His rebounding is still pretty bad for a guy his size, but he has gotten quite a bit better offensively.</p>
<p>Eric Hamilton: It’s unfair to expect much from a lot of grad transfer bigs. They’re usually in this spot for a reason. Hamilton has fallen off of late, but he had a great first 12 games.</p>
<p>Abdoul Karim Coulibaly: Has come along slowly, but I expected as much. Though his production isn’t much, he has looked good in moments.</p>
<p>Ryan Murphy: Prior to suffering a concussion, he was averaging 10.1 points per game, which is more than I expected from him. Still, he hasn’t been the reliable outside shooter for a team in dire need of one.</p>
<p><em>Fallen below</em></p>
<p>Xavier Johnson: His NBA draft stock has plummeted — he was a projected second-round pick coming into the season — and his shooting, a big area of focus in the offseason, has seemingly gotten worse.</p>
<p>Trey McGowens: He’s an incredible athlete who has improved as a passer and playmaker, but his recklessness in driving to the basket remains a problem and his shot selection is consistently bad.</p>
<p>Gerald Drumgoole: Part of this is due to missing time with an ankle injury, but averaging 1.2 points and shooting 18.5% from the field isn’t going to cut it for a rotation player, freshman or not.</p>
<p><strong>J.:</strong> Can you envision a scenario next season in which X/Trey do not spend as much time on the floor together? IMO their offense stalls and ball movement improves when one is not on floor, yet both are clearly among best players.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I can. While there’s familiarity and a certain kind of chemistry between them, Johnson and McGowens have somewhat redundant skill sets: athletic penetrators who are poor shooters and have bouts with poor decision-making. I think you’ll see a lot more lineups featuring either both of them and Ithiel Horton, who should give the backcourt an added dimension, or Horton and one of them while the other is on the bench.</p>
<p><strong>Tony</strong>: Biggest reason X and Trey regressed this year? Opposing coaches learning their skills? Shooting? Important conversation, I’m glad we’re having it? Champagnie is even better than Sam Young!</p>
<p><strong>Craig:</strong> There are any number of reasons for it, though I’m not totally sure they’ve regressed. They’ve gotten better in some areas and worse in others, which I think cancels out and means that, at worst, they’re about what they were last year — which is obviously a disappointment. You’d expect a player to get better from his freshman to sophomore season.</p>
<p>Their production is down in some part because of some better talent around them, at least when everyone was healthy. I think there’s something to be said for coaches having a year of tape on them. They’re getting to the free throw line less than they did last season, especially Johnson, which has come in part from referees catching on to some of their tactics to exaggerate contact. Their shooting has gotten much worse, as they’re both sub-40% shooters this season. It also still appears like they feel like they need to shoulder a disproportionate share of the offensive load, which is partially true because this is still a roster lacking depth, but there are options there more than happy and willing to help them.</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Given that Johnson and McGowens haven’t really shown improvement, what are realistic expectations for next year? I see people predicting NCAA tournament but I’m not sure I see where that drastic of an improvement can come from since the starting lineup might be exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: The third year is sometimes a pretty crucial and telling one for a coaching tenure. At Pitt, Ben Howland went from 19-14 in his second season to 29-6 in his third. Jeff Capel’s in a different spot. He took over a program in a much more precarious position, and I don’t think he has the talent Howland acquired in his first several seasons, from Brandin Knight to Julius Page.</p>
<p>Pitt’s success next season depends a lot on whether Johnson and McGowens play better than they have this season and exactly what kind of impact some of the newcomers may have, be it John Hugley, Noah Collier or any players who have yet to be added. Assuming the Panthers don’t make the NIT this season, I’d say any kind of postseason next season would be acceptable. If it’s the NCAA tournament, great. But if it’s not, that’s not some kind of scarlet letter on this program’s trajectory or Jeff Capel’s ability to oversee it.</p>
<p><strong>Evan</strong>: Do you think this current Pitt team could beat the Pitt team from Kevin Stallings’ first year when he had Jamel Artis and Mike Young? I feel like it’d be an intriguing matchup</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I don’t, though having covered both of those squads, I have very little confidence in definitively picking either. That Pitt team had any number of flaws, but it didn’t go 16-17 because of a lack of talent. It had two guys who signed NBA two-way contracts, another who grew into being a lottery pick and a fourth who’s in the G League. Unlike the current group of Panthers, which isn’t particularly good on either end of the court, the 2016-17 team was quite good offensively. I don’t think this team has the defensive wherewithal to neutralize Mike Young, Jamel Artis and Cam Johnson. I’d also add that Stallings’ first team was not only older and more experienced, but it played in a much tougher ACC, which had 10 teams in the top 50 of KenPom, compared to the five it currently has.</p>
<p><strong>Steel</strong>: Pitt needs to land a guy like Jeffress to take the next step. Where do you think they stand?</p>
<p><strong>Craig:</strong> I think William Jeffress would help immensely with that next step, though despite being a top-75 player in his class, it’s fair to question how much of an immediate help he’d provide given that he doesn’t even turn 17 until June. It may take some time for him to develop, grow and get adjusted to the college game. I think Pitt is in excellent shape to get him. It seems like Capel has used his almost two years with the Panthers to establish a really strong relationship with Jeffress and his family. And, for what it’s worth, each of the three 247 Sports experts who have made crystal ball predictions have Jeffress going to Pitt.</p>
<p><strong>Tristan</strong>: Should Panthers fans be expecting important non-senior roster departures this offseason?</p>
<p><strong>Whalen</strong>: How does Pitt have the scholarships to get Jeffress and Femi/best movie based on an SNL skit?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Right now, it doesn’t have any openings, meaning there will have to be additional departures. How important they are remains to be seen. It has two spots that are definitely open, with Hamilton out after this season and an additional open scholarship it has, but it has three signees right now, meaning an another spot will have to open up. If it adds Jeffress and/or Femi Odukale, there will have to be additional roster movement, which will almost certainly involve a rotation player should two or more players be signed.</p>
<p>For the last part of the second question — A Night at the Roxbury. I’ve never heard ‘What Is Love?” the same way again.</p>
<p><strong>Huggy</strong>: Will Pitt ever be able to recruit in the northeast again?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I’d argue they’re doing it already. Champagnie is from Brooklyn and 2020 signee Max Amadasun plays high school ball in the Bronx. Though he’s originally from Mali, you could even stretch the meaning of ‘Northeast’ and include Karim Coulibaly in that, since he went to high school near Chambersburg. It takes time to reestablish that kind of identity and Capel and his staff appear to be doing that, though they’ve also shown an ability to pull talented players out of the mid-Atlantic and South.</p>
<p><strong>bill stull fan account</strong>: What are your thoughts on Drumgoole? He hasn’t shown much during games because he doesn’t get a ton of minutes but have you heard anything about how he looks in practice?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Players seemed impressed with him in practices heading into the season, for what that’s worth. While it doesn’t fully explain some of his struggles this season, missing a month and a half of games with an ankle injury really set him back and by the time he came back, he had just one game before ACC-only play began. It’s hard to be off a metaphorical treadmill for six weeks and then having to jump on that same treadmill at 15 miles per hour. Still, a lot of time has passed since then and while he has had his more promising games that came with more minutes, he hasn’t been exactly what I would have expected from a top-150 recruit coming into the season.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: what kind of hair product do you use?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Old Spice pomade with a medium hold and matte finish. It’s great. My dad’s bald, so I’ve always been paranoid that I’ll one day lose my hair before 40, as well. I’m savoring it while I’ve got it and hoping for the best.</p>
<p><strong>Corey</strong>: What are the best quotes in the legendary comedy Office Space?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: There are some dated elements to that movie, but given that it came out more than 20 years ago, it holds up exceptionally well in portraying the culture of a soul-sucking office. If I had to pick a few favorite quotes …</p>
<p>— “It’s not that I’m lazy. It’s just that I don’t care.” I’ve used this as a justification any number of times.</p>
<p>— “What would you say...you do here?” Every office has at least one person who you have no idea what exactly it is they do.</p>
<p>— “You know, the Nazis had pieces of flair they made the Jews wear.” No additional context needed.</p>
