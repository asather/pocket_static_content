<h1>Penn State's Mac Hippenhammer reportedly enters transfer portal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State dual-sport athlete Mac Hippenhammer has reportedly entered the NCAA transfer portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hippenhammer played football and baseball for the Nittany Lions. Coach James Franklin told reporters two weeks ago that Hippenhammer was going to focus on playing baseball for the Nittany Lions going forward, but Rivals reported this weekend that he’s looking to transfer.</p>
<p>The Fort Wayne, Ind., native caught seven passes for 118 yards during the past two seasons. His sole touchdown came in a 2018 win against Pitt. He only caught one ball for 15 yards in 2019.</p>
<p>On the diamond, Hippenhammer posted a .249 batting average in two seasons. He played both outfield and infield positions and was 9-for-24 with eight RBIs in 13 games before the 2020 season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Hippenhammer was a three-star recruit when Penn State signed him as part of its 2017 recruiting class. He was ranked No. 61 at his position by Rivals and was the No. 5 player in Indiana. He redshirted during the 2017 season.</p>
<p>The NCAA last week granted spring sports athletes an extra year of eligibility due to the pandemic, which means Hippenhammer will be eligible to play baseball for two years. If Hipppenhammer decides to play football as well, he’ll have one year left.</p>
