<h1>'Judge Judy ' coming to an end after 25th season; new show in the works </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Television’s most popular judge, Judy Sheindlin, will be stepping down from her bench and into a new venture where she’ll still be serving justice.</p>
<p>Judge Sheindlin appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres show to announce that “Judge Judy” will enter its 25th and final season in syndication in 2021. The interview was released on <a href="https://www.ellentube.com/video/judge-judy-announces-big-plans-for-after-her-tv-show-ends.html#time=222" target="_blank">ellentube</a> Monday morning.</p>
<p>The TV host explained that CBS decided to stop producing new episodes after the end of next year’s season, and will sell off a few seasons of reruns to other networks.</p>
<p>“I’ve had a 25-year long marriage with CBS, and it’s been successful,” she said. “Next year will be our 25th year: Silver anniversary. And CBS, I think, sort of felt they wanted to optimally utilize the repeats of my program because now they have 25 years of reruns. So what they decided to do was to sell a couple of years worth of reruns.”</p>
<p>But court won’t be adjourned for long.</p>
<p>Judge Sheindlin said she is not retiring, and will be returning to the small screen with a new show called “Judy Justice” in 2022. She did not disclose which network the show will air on.</p>
<p>“But I’m not tired, so ‘Judy Justice’ will be coming out a year later,” she said.</p>
<p>Judge Sheindlin set the Guinness World Record in 2015 for longest career as a TV judge. The 77-year-old&nbsp;former Manhattan family court judge said she still has a lot more left in the tank and is looking forward to starting her new show.</p>
<p>“If you’re not tired, you’re not supposed to stop,” she said.</p>
