<h1>Presumptive positive cases of coronavirus increase in Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Positive cases of the coronavirus continue to increase in Eastern Pennsylvania, according to the state Department of Health.</p>
<p>Five additional cases of COVID-19 were announced Thursday, bringing the total number in the state to 21. The new cases include four residents from Montgomery County and one from Northampton County, state health officials said in a statement released Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Currently, 19 are presumptive positive cases while two —&nbsp;one in Delaware County and one in Wayne County — have been confirmed by the CDC, state officials said.&nbsp;All are adults who are in isolation at home or being treated at the hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of 10:40 a.m. Thursday, about 196 patients have been identified for testing in Pennsylvania. Around 100 tested negative for COVID-19 and 75 tests are pending, health officials said.</p>
<p>Officials anticipate more cases in the future.&nbsp;There have been nearly 128,000 cases worldwide and more than 4,700 deaths. There are 1,323 cases and 38 deaths to date in the United States, according to the state Department of Health.</p>
<p>“Right now, you have a higher chance of testing positive for COVID-19 if you have traveled to a country or state with known community outbreaks or have come in contact with someone who has the virus,”&nbsp;Health Secretary Rachel Levine said in a statement.&nbsp;“We are working with the health care community across Pennsylvania to keep them informed, consult on patient testing and ensuring they have the resources they need to care for patients.”</p>
<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, and may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those with pre-existing conditions and the elderly are most at risk for severe symptoms, health officials have said.</p>
<p>People are advised to wash hands often, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available, cover coughs or sneezes with elbows, keep surfaces clean, and to stay home if sick.</p>
