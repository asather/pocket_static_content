<h1>Behind cold offense, RMU falls to Merrimack, 53-49</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What has gone well for Robert Mor­ris in re­cent games did not go well Satur­day at UPMC Events Center.</p>
<p>The Co­lo­nials (8-10, 4-1 North­east Con­fer­ence) av­er­aged 82.5 points per game in their first four con­fer­ence match­ups, but they strug­gled to catch their usual fire against the Mer­ri­mack War­riors (11-8, 5-1), and were stuck in an ugly de­fen­sive strug­gle as a re­sult, los­ing, 53-49.</p>
<p>At points in the game, it seemed Robert Mor­ris was poised to break out of its slump and put a run to­gether, but that run never came.</p>
<p>In­stead, the Co­lo­nials trailed, 51-49, with 30 sec­onds left, but had an op­por­tu­nity to tie or take the lead. Robert Mor­ris whipped the ball around the pe­rim­e­ter and found soph­o­more guard Dante Treacy in the cor­ner, but his shot fell short. The War­riors got the re­bound, made two free throws and iced the game.</p>
<p>The Co­lo­nials’ four-game win­ning streak came to an end with their worst scor­ing out­put of the sea­son. They shot a dis­mal 2 for 15 from 3-point ter­ri­tory.</p>
<p>“I just don’t think we were play­ing at the pace we should have been, and we knew we should have,” Treacy said. “They kind of slowed us down and dic­tated the pace. Like [coach Andy] Toole said, they just kind of slowed us down and put the brakes on us. So I just don’t think we played at the pace we needed to.”</p>
<p>Per­haps most em­blem­atic of Robert Mor­ris’ strug­gles was the un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally quiet per­for­mance from fifth-year se­nior guard Josh Wil­liams. Wil­liams has paced the Co­lo­nials all sea­son of­fen­sively, av­er­ag­ing 15.2 points, but he was held to just 9 on 3-of-11 shoot­ing Satur­day.</p>
<p>Still, he had a chance to tie the score with 46 sec­onds left, as he caught the ball and was fouled, giv­ing him a one-and-one op­por­tu­nity with the Co­lo­nials down two. But he bricked the first free throw.</p>
<p>“Not to sound ar­ro­gant or any­thing, but I don’t,” Wil­liams said when asked if he thought he was be­ing smoth­ered by Mer­ri­mack. “I think I took the same shots in this game as I did the last time we played them. They just didn’t fall. I hit one early, an ‘and-one,’ that was prob­a­bly the most heav­ily con­tested 3 I took all game, and so the other ones, they just didn’t fall.”</p>
<p>Robert Mor­ris’ of­fen­sive mal­aise held true in the first half, too. Mer­ri­mack em­ployed a 2-3 zone, scram­bling to shoot­ers and forc­ing the Co­lo­nials to be crisp with their passes to find good looks.</p>
<p>And Robert Mor­ris ac­tu­ally did a pretty good job find­ing the soft spots early on, but the shots sim­ply weren’t fall­ing. Even float­ers and lay­ups in the paint wouldn’t drop. The Co­lo­nials de­fense kept them in the game, though, as they equally frus­trated Mer­ri­mack on the other end of the floor.</p>
<p>The re­sult was an ugly, rock fight of a first half, in which the teams com­bined to shoot 33% from the floor and just 2 for 15 from 3-point range. An em­phatic two-handed dunk from Bramah just be­fore the half­time buzzer put Robert Mor­ris in the lead, 23-22, head­ing into the break, but the per­for­mance left a lot to be de­sired.</p>
<p>It was a trend the Co­lo­nials could never break out of, and they’ll have to find a way to re­group be­fore tak­ing the floor again Mon­day against Sa­cred Heart.</p>
<p>“Ob­vi­ously that was frus­trat­ing,” Toole said. “Just un­able to get any rhythm of­fen­sively at any time. And it’s un­for­tu­nate. I thought we were a step slow in a lot of our cut­ting, our de­ci­sion-mak­ing, our ur­gency level on both sides of the floor, and give Mer­ri­mack credit.</p>
<p>“Ob­vi­ously, they came out and con­trolled the tempo and made some ad­just­ments from the first game, and we weren’t able to counter those with our own. Dis­ap­point­ing les­son, I guess, that we’ll have to learn and try and grow from.”</p>
