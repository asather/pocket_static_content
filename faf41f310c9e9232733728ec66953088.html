<h1>Pet Tales: What it's like to be nearly trampled by a Kentucky Derby winner</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Authentic crossed the Kentucky Derby finish line in commanding fashion last Saturday, the colt won the roses and a purse of $1.8 million. He also had more owners celebrating than any other horse in the field.</p>
<p>Top thoroughbred race horses are worth millions of dollars and most have multiple owners. Authentic entered the Kentucky Derby starting gate with 5,314&nbsp;“micro-owners” who paid $206 per share to MyRacehorse.com for 12½%&nbsp;of Authentic. That means the owners, who include at least a dozen Western Pennsylvanians, get&nbsp;12½% of his winnings on the track&nbsp;and the six-figure stud fees when he breeds.</p>
<p>Micro-owner Ed Hunt, 46, of Irwin watched the derby on TV at home with his wife, Jessica Merchant, and two relatives.</p>
<p>“It was very exciting,” he said.&nbsp;“Tiz the Law is such a strong horse. I didn’t think anyone could beat him.”</p>
<p>Tiz the Law, the favorite, earlier won the Belmont Stakes and finished second to Authentic in the Kentucky Derby.</p>
<p>MyRacehorse.com owner Michael Behrens, who was at Churchhill Downs representing the micro-owners,&nbsp;was drenched in champagne in the winners circle and had to&nbsp;“jump over bushes” to get out of the way of Authentic. The bay colt spooked when the roses were draped over his back, he said. The thoroughbred spun around, knocking down his trainer, Bob Baffert, and another man.</p>
<p>Neither the horse nor the people were injured. Mr. Baffert, now a six-time derby winner, joked that it was amazing that Authentic had so much energy left after running 1¼&nbsp;miles, Mr. Behrens said.</p>
<p>Authentic’s majority owner, B. Wayne Hughes, 86, of Spendthrift Farms, watched the race at his home in Lexington, Ky. Mr. Hughes, who made billions of dollars in the self-storage business, is also a partner in MyRacehorse.com. The owners of each of the 15 horses that ran in the derby received eight tickets. Mr. Hughes gave two to Mr. Behrens, who was excited about more than just Authentic’s upset victory (he was the No. 3 favorite).</p>
<p>He said all shares of Authentic were sold out before the start of the race and so was every other horse on the website, including unproven yearlings and 2-year-olds.</p>
<p>Hiphop artist Tjuan Benefactor, 38, of the Hill District, is glad he bought his shares in Authentic months ago.</p>
<p>“I would have never thought I would be an owner of a Kentucky Derby winner,” he said.</p>
<p>After Authentic won the derby and MyRacehorse.com sold out of its stock, Mr. Behrens said he bought a house in Kentucky to be closer to the heart of the racing world, including thoroughbred auctions and sales. He currently lives near San Diego.</p>
<p>“We will be buying more horses,” he said.&nbsp;“Right now there are thousands of people on the wait list” who want to be micro-owners.</p>
<p>Last year, MyRacehorse sold more than 70,000 shares in 47 horses. Shares in untested young horses go for as little as $60. Authentic was the most expensive horse, selling for $206 per share.</p>
<p>Micro-owners used to be able to tour barns to meet the horses, trainers and other workers. That will resume after the pandemic is over, Mr. Behrens said.</p>
<p>For now, Mr. Hunt is happy to “receive updates on how our horses are doing,” he said. He and other micro-owners get “photos and video of the horses working out, getting baths, getting off of planes and just relaxing.”</p>
