<p>An 83-year-old man was injured Monday morning after being struck by a car while crossing the street in Washington County, police said.</p>
<p>Authorities responded just after 7 a.m. to Route 19 in Peters. The incident occurred just outside a BP gas station, officials said.</p>
<p>“He was trying to walk across Route 19 and stepped out in front of a car that was traveling north when he was struck,” said Peters Township Police Chief Doug Grimes. The unidentified man was taken to Allegheny General Hospital where he is in stable condition.&nbsp;There were no other injuries.</p>
<p>A woman who operated the car that struck the man — who walked with a cane — stayed at the scene as they waited for emergency officials. The police chief said no charges will be filed at this time.</p>
<p>“We are performing accident reconstruction, where we have trained re-constructionists who calculate how the crash occurred and the speed of vehicle. We are still investigating.”</p>
