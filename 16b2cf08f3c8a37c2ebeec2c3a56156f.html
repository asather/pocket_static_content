<p>We’ve known for a long time that exercise can help your brain, particularly as you age. Now research suggests that your exercise can help someone else’s brain. Or, even better, depending on your point of view, someone else’s exercise can help yours.</p>
<p>A University of California, San Francisco, study involving mice has shown that the protein produced in the liver during exercise that helps improve mice brains can deliver the same brain-boosting effect when it is transfused from an exercising mouse to a couch-potato mouse.</p>
<p>Researchers injected blood from mice who spent time on an exercise wheel into the tails of the sedentary mice and discovered it produced improved cognitive performance and brain neuron growth almost on par with the animals that actually did the exercise to produce the beneficial enzyme.</p>
<p>The study showed the same liver enzyme shows up in higher levels in the blood of elderly humans who exercise than in those who don’t, pointing to the prospect that the effects of transfusing the enzyme into sedentary humans can produce the same benefits. What’s more, scientists may be able to use the findings to create drugs that do the same thing.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that the first best way to get the benefits of exercise isn’t to get off the couch yourself. Decades of research and piles of studies have shown, of course, that a healthy, physically active lifestyle yields many health benefits, not just for brain function.</p>
<p>But the mouse study is encouraging because it may lead to a treatment for people who can’t exercise. Elderly people, severely injured people and younger people who are in rehabilitation with debilitating ailments may get the exercise-protein boost they otherwise could not achieve for themselves.</p>
<p>It will take much more research for scientists to be able to synthesize drugs that deliver this benefit, of course. But in the meantime, it doesn’t hurt to once again see proof of what exercise can do to protect our brain health as we age and to stay physically active as long as we can.</p>
