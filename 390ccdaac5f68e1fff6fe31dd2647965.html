<p>A former WPIAL baseball standout was killed Saturday in a car crash in Westmoreland County, his high school baseball coach confirmed Sunday.</p>
<p>MacLean Maund, who was a star pitcher for Penn-Trafford High School and enrolled as a freshman at Seton Hill University, was killed in a head-on car crash on Route 130 between Jeannette and Harrison City.</p>
<p>Maund made the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette All-Area team in 2019, which is made up of the top 10 players in the WPIAL. As a senior pitcher, Maund helped <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/hsother/2019/05/09/maclean-maund-tyler-horvat-dan-miller-penn-trafford-warriors-baseball/stories/201905070105" target="_blank">Penn-Trafford get to the WPIAL championship game</a> last year for the first time in school history. He finished with a 6-1 record and 61 strikeouts in 44 1/3 innings. Opponents hit only .188 against him.</p>
<p>Maund was a freshman at Seton Hill and a member of the baseball team.</p>
<p>“People that pass away when they’re 80 and people say they lived a good life,” Penn-Trafford coach Dan Miller said. “Maclean lived a good life, but it was taken away way too soon.”</p>
<p>In a statement to its student and faculty community, Seton Hill said Maund was a business administration major&nbsp;“looking forward to his first baseball season as a pitcher and first baseman with Seton Hill this spring.”</p>
