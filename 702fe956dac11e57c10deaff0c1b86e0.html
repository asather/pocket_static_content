<h1>As Democrats wrap impeachment trial arguments, Trump legal team plans to discuss Bidens</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — House Democrats finished arguments in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial on Friday by casting Mr. Trump as an imminent threat to U.S. democracy who would continue to put his interests above those of the country if he is not removed from office.</p>
<p>“The president of the United States will abuse his power again,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. “He is who he is. That will not change and nor will the danger associated with him.”</p>
<p>The final round of arguments capped three days of presentations by a team of six Democratic trial managers that lasted a total of nearly 24 hours on the floor of the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Mr. Schiff, who has been the public face of impeachment since the inquiry was launched last September, took to the Senate floor in the final minutes in an effort to persuade all 100 senators gathered in front of him, bound by silence.</p>
<p>He praised the “chemistry between those members who represent swing states,” comparing it to military service.</p>
<p>“Real political courage doesn’t come from disagreeing with our opponents but disagreeing with our friends, and our party,” Mr. Schiff said. “Whether you like the president or dislike the president is immaterial. It’s all about the Constitution and his misconduct.”</p>
<p>Friday’s session was the Democrats’ final chance to sway skeptical senators and the American public tuning in at home. The House of Representatives impeached Mr. Trump in December on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.</p>
<p>At the center of the impeachment case, Democrats have argued that Mr. Trump abused his power by freezing nearly $400 million in security aid and withholding a coveted White House meeting in an attempt to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political rival.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, they argued, used the aid and the meeting as leverage to extract a public announcement from Ukraine that would implicate Vice President Joe Biden, who is a candidate to run against Mr. Trump in this year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>While Friday’s session recapped much of the evidence already presented, the team of six Democratic impeachment trial managers also sought to undercut expected White House arguments.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has claimed he is free from blame because he eventually released the aid to Ukraine. But Democrats argue he released the money only after the holdup was reported.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if extortion lasts two weeks or two months — it’s still extortion,” Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., told senators.</p>
<p>The managers called out White House’s “blatant” refusal to comply with Congressional subpoenas — addressing the second article of impeachment: obstruction of Congress.</p>
<p>“This discussion need not be abstract,” Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said. “We are talking about a direct order from the president of the United States to completely ignore all our subpoenas.”</p>
<p>Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., rebutted two arguments the White House has used to reject the subpoenas.</p>
<p>Nothing in the law requires the House to vote to “authorize” an impeachment proceeding, as White House lawyers claim, before that inquiry becomes official, Mr. Jeffries said.</p>
<p>The president’s claims of innocence do not constitute a legal argument either, he said.</p>
<p>“The president cannot lawfully object to the House impeachment inquiry because he sees no reason to be investigated,” Mr. Jeffries said. “The president has put forth fake arguments about the process because he cannot defend the substance of the arguments.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Senate turns its attention to the White House legal team, which plans to refute the Democrats’ arguments and presenting an “affirmative case,” Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, told reporters during a break in the trial.</p>
<p>The White House defense strategy will include a discussion of Democratic efforts to dig up dirt on Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Sekulow told reporters.</p>
<p>The defense will also discuss Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, while his father called for the resignation of an anti-corruption official that had targeted the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Sekulow said House Democrats — by saying for days that Mr. Trump was motivated by debunked conspiracy theories — “not only opened the door, but kicked down the door” for the White House to make Hunter Biden and Burisma part of their arguments.</p>
<p>"Here's what the evidence says: There was foreign involvement, but let's not forget where it originated," said Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, told reporters. The Democratic National Committee, he suggested, surveilled the Trump campaign in 2016.</p>
<p>“We haven't put our case out, obviously,” Mr. Sekulow said. “But you should be able to get a sense, from what I'm saying right now.”</p>
<p>It’s an argument that could play to Senate Republicans.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a fierce defender of the president, told reporters on Friday that a probe into Hunter Biden and Burisma was a legitimate demand by Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>“The bottom line here is that when it came to President Trump’s insistence that someone look at what happened with the Bidens and the Ukraine — I think he’s right,” Mr. Graham said. “I think somebody should.”</p>
<p>Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., said House managers committed a “serious tactical mistake” by focusing so much on Mr. Trump’s demand that Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden and Burisma.</p>
<p>“I think yesterday was very consequential, because what they’ve done is they’ve opened the door to Burisma,” Mr. Cruz said in an interview with conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt. “They’ve opened the door to Hunter Biden testifying.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether the White House team would seek to call Hunter Biden to testify. But doing so would complicate an already messy fight among senators over whether to call witnesses or subpoena additional documents the Trump administration has refused to turn over.</p>
<p>Four Republican senators would have to join all 47 Democrats in supporting a resolution to call witnesses.</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., speaking with reporters early Friday, said he will make a final decision on witnesses after senators complete their round of questioning next week.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that there should be an automatic presumption that there have to be witnesses,” Mr. Toomey said. “Much of what would be discussed among fact witnesses is not in dispute in the first place.”</p>
<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll published Wednesday showed about 72% of Americans believe the Senate should vote to call witnesses. That survey, conducted Jan. 17-22, showed 84% of Democrats and 69% of Republicans supported witnesses.</p>
<p>Public opinion is split almost exactly down the middle on impeachment.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2020/01/22/by-a-narrow-margin-americans-say-senate-trial-should-result-in-trumps-removal/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center survey</a> published on Wednesday found 51% of Americans believe Mr. Trump should be removed from office. The research organization conducted that survey among 12,638 U.S. adults over two weeks ending Jan. 19.</p>
<p>Pew’s survey also found 63% of Americans believed Trump had definitely or probably done things that are illegal, either during his time as president or as a candidate. And an even larger portion of the country, 70%, believed Mr. Trump had done unethical things.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey — who has criticized the president’s conduct in his phone call with the Ukrainian leader — reiterated his stance on Friday that impeachment and removal is a “very, very high bar.”</p>
<p>“Whatever one may think about this president — his character, his behavior — I think there’s a very powerful presumption that it’s the American people’s decision,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>The White House is expected to have shorter presentations than the Democrats. Saturday’s session is scheduled to last just three hours, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>
<p>“I did an oral argument in the Supreme Court once where my argument was eight minutes — worked out pretty well,” Mr. Sekulow said. “Sometimes, less is more.”</p>
