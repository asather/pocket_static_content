<h1>Ben Roethlisberger throws a football; Steelers optimistic on recovery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ben Roethlisberger began throwing a football, albeit lightly, during an evaluation in Los Angeles with his orthopedic surgeon and there is nothing about his recovery that is discouraging to the Steelers organization, according to sources familiar with his situation.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger has been “working his rear off” to recover from an elbow injury that ended his 2019 season after two games and required surgery, according to a source. Dr. Neal ElAttrache, a Mount Pleasant native who graduated from Pitt’s medical school, performed the surgery in September and met with Roethlisberger on Friday.</p>
<p>The Steelers released a video on Saturday that showed Roethlisberger, wearing shorts and a backward baseball cap, throwing a football indoor for the first time since he was injured.</p>
<p>All of the top members of the Steelers organization — president Art Rooney II, general manager Kevin Colbert and Coach Mike Tomlin — have&nbsp; expressed optimism with Roethlisberger’s recovery, even though the 16-year veteran had not tested his throwing elbow until Friday. However, they have not put a time table on his return.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger plans to work with his throwing coaches in Los Angeles before returning to Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The key to Roethlisberger’s recovery will be how well he is able to “spin” the football with his throwing motion. His spin-rate numbers will be matched against a baseline to determine the extent of his recovery.</p>
