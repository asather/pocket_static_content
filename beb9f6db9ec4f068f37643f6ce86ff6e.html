<h1>Butler County schools to donate PPE to hospital</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Schools in Butler County are giving a lesson in generosity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The eight school districts and vocational technical school in the county have agreed to donate personal protective equipment from their classrooms, science labs and nurses offices to Butler Memorial Hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The equipment —&nbsp;which includes goggles, face masks, gloves and other items — is important for hospital employees to use so that they can avoid becoming infected with the coronavirus or other contagious diseases they may encounter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We are better when we collaborate and work together,”&nbsp;Tracy Vitale, superintendent of the Seneca Valley School District, said in a statement. “These donations could save a life — one of our employees, one of our students, one of our community members — or even one of our family members.”</p>
<p>Staff from Butler Memorial Hospital will pick up the equipment Wednesday morning at the Seneca Valley administration building.</p>
<p>As of Monday, 143 people tested positive and four people had died from COVID-19 in Butler County, according to the state Department of Health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The superintendents of the schools districts and executive director of the vocational school decided to donate their supplies after Jeffrey Finch, superintendent of the Grove City School District in Mercer County, coordinated a collection of personal protective equipment for Grove City Hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Vitale and&nbsp;Brian White, superintendent of the Butler Area School District, led the communication and coordination for the effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In total, the schools donated 292 new and 406 gently used goggles; 213 new and 517 gently used safety glasses; 218 protective gowns; 712 protective face masks; and 19,407 protective gloves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The first responders, doctors and nurses are the true heroes in this pandemic,” Ms. Vitale said. “This is a prime example of when we all work together in Butler County, we get things done.”</p>
<p>Individuals or businesses interested in donating money or personal protective equipment to the Butler Health System should email covid19donations@butlerhealthsystem.org.</p>
