<h1>Here's a look at some of the exhibits that jurors are weighing in the Wilkinsburg mass shooting trial</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Here is some of the evidence that jurors saw and heard during the Wilkinsburg mass shooting trial, in which defendant Cheron Shelton is accused of killing five adults and an unborn child during a backyard cookout in 2016. The jury is in deliberations:</p>
<p><strong>Letters.</strong> These are the letters that Cheron Shelton wrote in&nbsp;the Allegheny County Jail to his girlfriend, Channel Falls (addressed&nbsp;to Brown Suga) and her father, Adrien Falls (addressed to Pops), which&nbsp;were intercepted by police.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny County Jail video No. 1.</strong> Video of Cheron Shelton during a jailhouse visit&nbsp;on April 6, 2016 with his father, Robert Shelton. Police believe that&nbsp;Shelton reacted with shock to learning that his letters had been&nbsp;intercepted by police. Shelton did not realize that he was being taped&nbsp;as part of a search warrant by police to install a video recorder in&nbsp;the visitation room.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny County Jail video No. 2.</strong> More video of Shelton's jailhouse visit with his&nbsp;father, in which he can be seen acting out firing a gun and, police&nbsp;say, starting a lawn mower. Investigators believe that Shelton was&nbsp;furtively trying to give his father instructions on how to find the&nbsp;murder weapon for disposal.</p>

<p><strong>Shots ring out.</strong> This is audio of the gunfire at 1304 Franklin Ave. in Wilkinsburg on&nbsp;March 9, 2016, that killed five adults and an unborn child. The sound&nbsp;starts around 45 seconds into this file and continues until about the 1:09 mark.&nbsp;The audio came from a nearby homeowner's surveillance system and&nbsp;recorded 18 .40-caliber rounds and 30 7.62-caliber rounds being fired. The clip was provided by the Allegheny County District Attorney's Office.</p>
