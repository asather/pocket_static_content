<h1>Mitch Keller to return Monday against Reds</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>KANSAS CITY — Mitch Keller will make his first start since Aug. 1 and third overall in 2020 when the Pirates play a doubleheader in Cincinnati on Monday, manager Derek Shelton announced Sunday morning before the Pirates’ series finale against the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old right-hander has been out with a left oblique injury he suffered eight outs into his start against the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Shelton said he was not yet sure which of the two games Keller will pitch.</p>
<p>“It’s important to get him innings through the rest of the year, with the time he’s missed going into 2021,” Shelton said. “Getting him back on the mound is important to us.”</p>
<p>Once considered the Pirates’ top prospect before he graduated to big leaguer status, there was much expected out of Keller this season.</p>
<p>So far, however, he’s been limited to one solid start in St. Louis on July 26, when Keller didn’t have his best stuff. In five innings, Keller struck out two and allowed an earned run to help Shelton win his first MLB game.</p>
<p>Don’t expect a normal start from Keller. While Shelton won’t talk about innings or pitch projections for guys coming back from injury, he did draw a parallel to Joe Musgrove, who returned from roughly a month out because of right triceps and ankle issues to throw 46 pitches over three innings on Sept. 2.</p>
<p>Next time out, on Sept. 8, Musgrove threw 64 pitches over four innings.</p>
<p>It’s likely this will be the first of three rehab starts for Keller, assuming things go well. If he pitches every fifth day, Keller would get opportunities on Sept. 19 and 24.</p>
<p><strong>Move your feet</strong></p>
<p>It's been a rough fielding year for Kevin Newman, the infielder making six errors in 33 games. That works out to nearly 30 over the course of a 162-game season, which isn't anywhere near acceptable.</p>
<p>Newman has bounced around a bit, primarily between shortstop and second base, but Shelton said that hasn't been the primary issue why his fielding has taken a hit. The bigger problem, Shelton believes, is that Newman isn't moving his feet enough.</p>
<p>"The main thing is, we’ve got to get his feet underneath him, moving his feet, making sure his feet are in the right spot," Shelton said. "That’s the thing that stands out. I know you see the balls that hit off his glove but usually that happens when your feet are not in the right spot. That’s one of the things that we’re talking about and isolating on with him.”</p>
<p>That error total should probably be one higher, too. In the first inning of Friday's game, Royals first baseman Hunter Dozier hit a ball that Newman couldn't handle, though it was ultimately ruled a hit by the official scorer.</p>
