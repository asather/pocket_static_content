<h1>Paul Zeise: Matt Murray's Stanley Cups can only buy him so much good will</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins will play in Vegas against the Golden Knights on Tuesday night, and that can only mean one thing: Let’s renew the Marc-Andre Fleury vs. Matt Murray debate!</p>
<p>I’m just joking; there isn’t a franchise in the NHL that would have kept Fleury over Murray in 2017, given the respective ages and contracts of the two at the time. Murray had proven he can win in the playoffs and was a rookie, so there was no real way to justify keeping a player 10 years older than him. Yes,&nbsp;Fleury has clearly been the better of the two players in the 2½&nbsp;seasons since he left, but that fact is not relevant. Don’t we all wish we could make decisions with hindsight as our guide?</p>
<p>All that doesn’t mean there isn’t something to talk about with regards to the career of Murray and where it’s headed. If I would have told you when the trade was made that less than three years later one of the two goalies would be fighting to keep his starting job, how many of you would have said it would be Murray?</p>
<p>Murray — deservedly so — has gotten a lot of benefit of the doubt because of those two Stanley Cup runs. He was spectacular, almost magical at times, in the playoffs during those back-to-back title runs of 2016 and 2017. He was also a rookie (both seasons, actually) and barely old enough to legally have a beer, and it seemed like he was on the fast track to a Hall of Fame career.</p>
<p>He hasn’t come close to growing into that franchise goalie that the Penguins thought he would be by now. He has had a number of moments where he has been close to that, but overall he has been too inconsistent and has missed too much time to be considered reliable.</p>
<p>Murray had his worst playoff performance last season in just about every category (including wins and losses), and he has followed that up with what is shaping up to be his worst regular season. The combination of his inconsistency and bad play along with the way “backup” Tristan Jarry has played has once again has created a bit of a goalie competition/controversy.</p>
<p>Jarry is likely to continue to get the bulk of the work if he continues to perform at a high level. He has lost two games in a row entering Tuesday, but it isn’t like he played poorly in either of them. If he loses a couple of more, he could create another opening for Murray to win his job back. That’s why it is getting to a critical time for the Penguins.</p>
<p>Murray is the goalie with the Stanley Cup pedigree, so I’m sure the Penguins are hoping he finds his form and becomes the unquestioned starter again before the playoffs. I’m sure Murray is hoping for the same since this is a contract year for him and his ability to cash in big on a lucrative deal seems to slip away a little bit more with every game he loses or spends sitting and watching Jarry.</p>
<p>At some point, though, Murray has to go out and prove he is that player. At some point, he has to prove he can be durable. At some point, he needs to stop living off of&nbsp;“He once won two Stanley Cups” and go out and show he is that same goalie.</p>
<p>The Penguins need him to do it because they won’t win a Stanley Cup with Jarry in the goal. I could be a fool and I am sure I’ll be reminded of this if it happens, but I like their chances of winning in the playoffs a whole lot more with a goalie who has done it before.</p>
<p>Murray’s career is not over by any means. He is not a bust and he is not a guy that should be discarded as old news. But his clock is ticking and the further he gets away from being a championship goalie, the harder it will become to justify paying him a big salary and the tougher it will become to envision him having much of a future in Pittsburgh.</p>
