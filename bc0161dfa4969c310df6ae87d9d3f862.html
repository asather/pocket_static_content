<h1>Ray Fittipaldo's Steelers chat transcript: 06.02.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Welcome to my Steelers chat. Let's get it going.</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Ray - Will we find out early in the season how successful the Steelers have been in fortifying their perceived weakness in the middle of the defense? In the first eight games, three of the teams were in the top five rushing teams in 2019, four teams in the top ten, and six of the first eight teams on the schedule were in the top twelve....thanks. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Good observation. A smart offensive coordinator will take note of the problems the Steelers had stopping the run last season, especially late in the season. The Steelers have to be better against the likes of the Ravens, Titans and Bills. The Ravens ran all over them in the finale and the Bills did some damage on the ground, too. I like the Steelers defense, but you are right. This something they have to fix in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Utah Jim</strong>: Are the Ravens really significantly better than a healthy Steelers? I'd certainly take the Steelers defense and their QB has never won a playoff game. Maybe they are better at RB and TE but I don't see much else. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Their QB was the league MVP. I understand he's still young and has much to prove, but he's the engine that makes that offense go. Without him, they're nothing more than a mediocre team. I don't know about significantly better, but I think the Ravens have a better roster than the Steelers. Maybe not by as much as some people think though.</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: do you own a steelers jersey, and if so, which player? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: When I was a kid I had a bunch: Franco, Swann, Lambert. I remember my dad had John Banaszak, which I always thought was such a different choice for those Super Bowl teams. But no, I am a journalist now, and I don't own any Steelers jerseys.</p>
<p><strong>thomastown</strong>: I understand the health concerns related to plans to have games without fans. I’ve always thought a major justification for the large dollars spent on sports was the economic benefit to the community. It seems to me this plan will only take care of the wealthy elites (owners and players) but leave the regular folks (stadium workers, restaurant and hotel employees, etc.) behind. What am I missing here? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: It's a temporary solution until there is a vaccine. Many others will benefit with the work. Opposing teams will stay in hotels, eat at restaurants, etc. The other work will return when the fans come back, but games with no fans is certainly better than no games at all.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Hey Ray...JuJu’s career got off to a great start. He was hailed as the next great Steelers receiver. After a subpar season in an unusual year to say the least, it seems most people want to run him out of town. Can you please explain this? Is there an explanation? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Not quite sure. He's young and had a very good track record when Ben was his QB. I know Antonio Brown was a constant for his first two seasons, but he deserves a chance to prove he can be a No. 1 with Ben as his QB. Last season he dealt with injuries and an iffy QB situation to say the least.</p>
<p><strong>Gino</strong>: Any chance Conner takes a hometown discount to stay with the Steelers? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Who knows? But I ask why would any NFL player much less a player at the position with the shortest shelf life take less money ever? It's about maximizing earning potential. Professional sports is a business. Conner and the Steelers will treat it as such when the 2020 season ends.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Does the fact that under the new playoff format Mike Tomlin's teams would have made the playoffs three more times strengthen his already strong resume? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I suppose, but the fact is the Steelers missed the playoffs in those years when they had real strong chances of qualifying before late-season swoons. That's on him. The Steelers have to find ways to be better at the end of seasons.</p>
<p><strong>Bruce C.</strong>: Are there any free agents the Steelers are looking at? Thanks. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Not currently, but they'll keep an eye on the waiver wire in September after teams make their final cuts. They always do.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: How many years do you think Pouncey, DeCastro and Al have collectively and individually? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I can see Pouncey retiring when Ben does. Both have two years left on their contracts. Villanueva's contract expires after the coming season. I could see him retiring if the Steelers don't want to bring him back. I think DeCastro has a few more years left.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Hi Ray, great article on JP. You quoted him as saying "You know you’ll get another five or six years out of that tandem." A capologist he is not, but do you think he knows something we don't? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Honestly, I asked myself that question when I went back and listened to his answer when I wrote the story. He hasn't been around the team in more than a year, so I don't think so. Nonetheless, it did make me think twice about the whole deal at OLB. I still think Dupree prices himself out of Pittsburgh with another good year. But never say never.</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Sam</strong>: With today being primary Election Day, who gets your vote for most improved Steelers players on offense and defense this coming season? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I'll say Devin Bush and Diontae Johnson because the leap from year 1 to year 2 is always pretty pronounced. And I think both guys are really talented and primed for big years.</p>
<p><strong>Southside Jimmy</strong>: Hi Ray. What’s your opinion of the 4th down and 15 proposal that has been tabled to next season? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I liked the idea and hope they revisit in the future. I think the onside kick is almost impossible to convert now so why not give skill players a shot in those situations.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Hi Ray and thanks as always for the chats. What teams do you think are going to have an advantage once things open back up? Or I guess the question is what are those teams doing differently? Are they providing zoom workouts or simply letting players workout on there own? I hear they are having zoom meetings on the playbook but what about film study? have you heard of anything different or creative happening? I am asking in hopes we avoid another slow start <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Every team is pretty much in the same boat. Zoom meetings for the classroom learning and counting on professionalism when it comes to the players working on their own. I think the advantage will come in how the coaches take advantage of the time when they get everyone back in the building. Rookies and young players already missed OTAs and minicamp. How quickly can they get those players up to speed in the classroom and on the field. The coaches that can make it happen sooner might have an advantage, but more than likely, the teams with lots of starters returning are in the best shape because the players know what they're doing.</p>
<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Do you view Edmunds as having position flexibility and does this enhance his value as a former first round pick? That said, if he finds a role there as a hybrid, might this be less of a make or break year for him? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I think he does have position flexibility, but whether the Steelers use him as a dime LB might depend more upon their comfort level with someone else at strong safety in the situations they want to move him down in the box. He's got the perfect body type for a hybrid player.</p>
<p><strong>Buster</strong>: How would you rank Lloyd, Harrison and Porter in their prime? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: That's a tough question. Porter backed up his talk in Super Bowl XL, and he was such an important player for those teams in the early 2000s because of the emotion he played with. But it terms of strictly on-field impact I guess I'd have to go Harrison first, then Porter and then Lloyd. Interested to see how others would rank that trio.</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville</strong>: Ray-I’m still a little confused about the O-line. It appears as though they went from one of the best to not very good over one offseason. I’ve heard that they were built for pass pro but they were a pretty <br> <strong>Alan in Nashville</strong>: but they were pretty good for Bell and Conner til he started getting hurt. Then I heard that they’re old but for that position, 30-31 really isn’t that old. Then they sign a 31-year-old FA. Could it really be as simple as Munchack being gone? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I think it's a combination of what you said. They are built to pass protect. There is no doubt about that. They have their linemen operate out of two-point stances for most plays, including runs. It's hard to be a good run-blocker from a two-point stance. But the age thing is real. All players decline at a certain age, and the Steelers had a number of guys passing 30 at the wrong time.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Lambert's tooth</strong>: Seems like training camp in latrobe isn't happening. Is that a good or bad thing for the team? If they're on the South Side will the players live at home or will they still try to keep them sequestered? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: This is an interesting question. The traditional camp at Latrobe seems like a long shot, but you are right. They do have an ability to keep players sequestered from others during those five or six weeks. Now the really interesting thing that will happen is how long players will allow themselves to be away from family. In a normal camp, families come into the cafeteria and eat with their loved ones. They visit on campus. So if families are not allowed to visit the question is whether the NFLPA will allow long camps without families. This has been a sticking point in the MLB season getting started. Players didn't want hub cities because they didn't want to be away from their families for long periods. There would be some issues with a camp on the South Side such as what players are doing after they go home. Are they being exposed to the virus? Etc. I tend to think they'll try to make it work on the South Side, but we all know how much Mike Tomlin and the Rooney family enjoy camp at Saint Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>Ghollywoodg</strong>: If Matt Filer gets an extension as expected , what do you think the numbers would look like? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: You say "as expected." While I think Feiler certainly has earned his playing time and spot as a starter I don't necessarily believe he's first or even second in line for a contract extension. I think they'll look to do Cam Heyward first and then maybe JuJu though I doubt those two sides will come to an agreement. I guess it would depend on where they think he'll be playing in the next few years. Tackles get paid more than guards. So maybe $8 million a year as a tackle and maybe $5 or 6 million if he's a long-term answer at guard.</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Ray, thanks for the chats! Mark Madden says JuJu is gone no matter what type of season he has this year. What are your thoughts? Or is this Madden just creating click bait? Thanks! <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: If JuJu puts up great numbers he's going to command big money on the open market should he get there. Don't forget, the Steelers can use a franchise tag on him. That's a possibility that would keep him with the Steelers beyond 2020 without a long-term deal.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Aside from Ben, who is the most indispensible Steeler in 2020? I believe it is either Watt, Nelson, or Haden. What say you? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: What about Minkah? They were a completely different defense once he arrived.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: Should I buy game tickets/travel from L.A./hotel/etc. for the Thanksgiving home game against the Ravens? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I'd make sure I was able to get refunds. Still lots of unknowns about what's going to happen in the fall, including whether fans will be allowed in stadiums.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: For all those doubting Juju people should watch old Steeler games when AB had 1 catch for 6 yards. There are more pics of him sitting on the bench than on the field. I get he went on to be great but Juju has done much more in much less time <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: People forget JuJu is younger than Diontae Johnson. And yes, I get your point on AB without Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ALB</strong>: Ray, what do you think of DeSean Jackson’s idea of having a mic on all players? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I didn't see his comment, but I as assuming it was in regard to the Rudolph-Garrett dust-up. I suppose mics would shed some light on those types of conversations, but there would be a cost associated with that. Plus, I believe the mics worn by players today is voluntary. I think the NFLPA would have to sign off on any new rule like that. And it's not part of the new CBA that was ratified in March.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Not anytime soon but could you see Haden transitioning to safety one day, potentially avoiding losing another great corner. Not sure he has the size but wanted your thoughts <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Yeah that's always an interesting discussion. Which corners can move to safety and thrive? Joe doesn't have prototypical safety size, that's for sure. But hey, anyone with as much savvy as Joe could figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>Jay</strong>: I enjoy the chats Ray. I think fans need to be patient with young players. I’m sure people were ready to get rid of Bradshaw and Troy, especially after the rookie seasons. They didn’t turn it too bad did they? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: No they didn't. Those are two very good examples. The problem today is the length of rookie contracts and the rush to get the most out of young players. Sometimes they're not ready, but the team has invested draft capital and money into them so there is pressure to play. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Ok that's all the time we have this week. Thanks for the questions and we'll do it again next week.</p>
