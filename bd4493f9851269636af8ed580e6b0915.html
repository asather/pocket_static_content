<h1>Mt. Oliver man convicted of abusing minors arrested for failing to register as sex offender</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A convicted felon who served nearly 20 years in prison for sexually abusing two minors in the ’90s, was found and arrested Monday in Huntingdon County after lying about his address and failing to register as a sex offender.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Sheriff’s deputies found Edward Stallman, 57, of Pittsburgh, around 6 p.m. Monday near Route 522 in Orbisonia, Pa. under a tree near an abandoned railroad track, police said. He was arrested without incident and taken to the Allegheny County Jail, where he is currently being held. He waived his right to an arraignment in Huntingdon, police said.</p>
<p>He is charged with two felony counts of failure to comply with registration of sexual offense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stallman in January was supposed to register as a sex offender for life under Megan’s Law, police said. After neglecting to do so, he was listed as non-compliant by state police, which prompted sheriff’s deputies to conduct a Megan’s Law compliance check at his last registered address in Pittsburgh’s Mt. Oliver Borough. Authorities found that Stallman had never lived at this address, police said. Charges were filed against him the following day in accordance with Megan’s Law.</p>
<p>“Numerous” social media tips and local residents helped police determine that Stallman was actually living in the woods near a mountain ridge in Huntingdon, police said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for Sept. 9 before&nbsp;Magisterial District Judge&nbsp;Richard G. King, according to court records.</p>
<p>Stallman in 2001 pleaded guilty to aggravated indecent assault and indecent deviate sexual intercourse,&nbsp;Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office’s Chief Deputy Kevin Kraus said. Stallman was&nbsp;originally charged with two counts of aggravated indecent assault, 12 counts of indecent deviate sexual intercourse, 12 counts of incest, 12 counts of indecent deviate sexual intercourse with a person less than 13 years of age, and 12 counts of indecent deviate sexual intercourse with a person less than 16 years of age.</p>
