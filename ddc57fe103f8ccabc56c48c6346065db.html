<h1>WEATHER: Approaching winter weather will skirt Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Traveling north or east this week? Get ready for a reminder that it’s still winter.</p>
<p>An approaching winter storm won’t do much more than bring an inch or two of snow to the immediate Pittsburgh region, but the National Weather Service expects dicier conditions in the Laurel Highlands and in Lake Erie’s snow belt.</p>
<p>Rain will return to Pittsburgh this afternoon and change to snow showers tonight. Snow showers will continue here Thursday, the weather service said, but accumulations aren’t expected to be significant. We’ll see scattered snow showers on Friday as well, before the weather clears for the weekend.</p>
<p>Although the storm shouldn’t reach severe levels in Allegheny County, officials here still still preaching preparation and caution, especially during Thursday’s morning commute.</p>
<p>“We will deploy 28 salt trucks starting at midnight, and we will provide continual coverage until the precipitation stops and county roadways are clear,” Allegheny County Public Works Director Stephen G. Shanley said in a statement. “We advise drivers to be extra cautious and leave additional time to reach their destination tomorrow, especially during the morning rush hour, as there might be slick spots on roads and bridges.”</p>
<p>Areas to the east, though, are included in a winter weather advisory, in effect through noon Thursday; the ridges will receive up to 4 inches of snow and winds could gust up to 40 mph until the storm passes.</p>
<p>And that’s mild, compared to what’s expected for the south shore of Lake Erie. Depending on specific location, those regions are under a winter storm watch or lake-effect snow warnings into the weekend, and the snow could be measured in feet.</p>
