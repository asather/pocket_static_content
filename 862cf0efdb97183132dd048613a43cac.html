<h1>Letters from Pirates camp: A view from the other side</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Start days are always special. Some major league pitchers celebrate by wearing different attire — cowboy boots, for example — while others are simply laser-focused. Regardless of what you do, it’s impossible not to have a little bounce in your step when you know you have the ability to influence the game on every pitch.</p>
<p>That was me Monday at Pirates Fantasy Camp. I was like a little kid on Christmas. And while I neither wore cowboy boots nor achieved anything even remotely close to exemplary results, I did learn a few things, which is ultimately the point of being here.</p>
<p>The most interesting part of the day actually occured at the end, when the tables turned.</p>
<p>With a runner on second base, two outs in the bottom of the seventh inning and our team needing a run to force extra innings, I popped out to the pitcher to end the game.</p>
<p>Forget the fact that I had gone 3-for-3 with a triple and four RBIs before my final at-bat of the game. In crunch time, when my team needed me to come through, I let them down. The result was our team — the Traynors — blowing a six-run lead to fall to 0-3 thus far. Fantasy camp or not, I was upset. I blew it. And then, as I walked back to the dugout, I had someone wanting to ask me a few questions about the situation and my inability to come through — Roy Berger, who’s the beat reporter for Pirates Fantasy Camp.</p>
<p>I was cordial with Roy and answered his questions, but the moment shed some light into our job as reporters: asking jobs of athletes who are sometimes ticked off because they didn't get the results they wanted.</p>
<p>What I did was obviously on a very, very small scale; it’s fantasy camp, for crying out loud. But I appreciate the understanding and will try my best to remember it this upcoming season.</p>
<p>It was a neat way of seeing what it’s like to be on the other side of those questions, the same as the pregame interview I did with PNC Park in-game host Joe Klimchak.</p>
<p>(Truth be told, I also teased Joe about another rule of start days, how you’re not supposed to talk to the starting pitcher before the game.)</p>
<p><strong>An ugly start</strong></p>
<p>In addition to my postgame interview discovery, I’ve also learned that I am indeed 36 years old and haven’t thrown a baseball in a long time. After two days, my arm hurts. I’ve actually fell well short of the expectations I had for myself at this thing, with the health of my arm the No. 1 issue.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to be decently tough throughout my athletic career. I kept playing football when a face mask split the webbing between my pointer and middle fingers, exposing my knuckle. I finished another football game when I separated my shoulder, and I’ve always taken pride in having a fairly resilient arm, where I threw a lot and never really had any arm issues.</p>
<p>I’m worried those days may be over.</p>
<p>After pitching three innings in the morning — the maximum allowed for one game — I tried to come back in the afternoon. It did not work out well. I couldn’t find the strike zone. When I did find it, I had no life on anything I threw, and I basically couldn’t control any of my pitches besides a … I guess we’ll call it a fast(er) ball. Worst of all, there was pain, a lot of pain.</p>
<p>In search of some relief, I ventured over to the training room, which has quickly become one of the most popular parts of Pirate City. And these guys do a tremendous job, too. They’re patient, helpful and fun.</p>
<p>On one wall, there’s a bunch of bug spray, sunscreen and lip balm. Across from that are four different kinds of pain medication: Advil, Tylenol, Bayer and Motrin.</p>
<p>Further down a long, rectangular table that sits in the middle of the room are several different balms and numbing agents. I would say it’s some sort of old guy pain buffet, but on this day, I was pretty damn hungry.</p>
<p>Dru Scott, who’s the head athletic trainer for Triple-A Indianapolis, bundled my right arm and shoulder in ice packs, and I cautiously made my way toward the hot/cold tubs, eventually alternating between the two in three-minute intervals.</p>
<p>The cold tub wasn’t terribly eventful. It was just … cold. We’ll see Tuesday if it does anything. I’m also supposed to arrive early for our mid-afternoon game to receive around 30 minutes of arm/shoulder treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Another good lesson</strong></p>
<p>If the end of Monday’s second game taught me something about player-media relations, the Starling Marte trade told me something I think I may have already known: I really like this job and all that it entails.</p>
<p>A big part of me hated that I was down here doing this while the Marte trade broke. I feel like I should have been around to help our Pirates beat and the Post-Gazette, as it’s really a pretty big move that (finally) signals which direction they’re headed. (How are you not rebuilding if you trade Marte for a couple of prospects who will take significant time to develop?)</p>
<p>This led to me checking my phone during the game probably more than I should have, but it’s hard to ignore something like that. It’s what we do. And whether it’s fantasy camp, a family party or any other type of activity, I simply like being in the middle of it all.</p>
<p><strong>‘Stop, look around’</strong></p>
<p>Wardo Brigham is a pitcher/infielder on our team, and he has a neat story. He and Rico Ries — our left fielder — do these camps all the time. Brigham has now done 17, with Ries attending 13. Together they’ve seen the Mets, Reds, Braes, Tigers, Yankees and Pirates. They’ve both done the Pirates camp for the past eight years.</p>
<p>Brigham was my bullpen catcher on Monday morning, and I really appreciated a piece of advice he gave me. Not just in a baseball sense, either.</p>
<p>“Pitcher is the only position on the field where they have to wait on you,” Brigham said. “So take your time. Make ‘em wait. Stop and look around.”</p>
<p>That’s great mound advice for me, someone who tends to rush his delivery and not take long enough between pitches. But it also applies to anything we do, right? Take your time. Stop and look around.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about what Wardo said and trying to apply it to this entire trip.</p>
