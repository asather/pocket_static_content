<h1>GNC seeks filing extension to address debt</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>GNC officials Monday notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that it does not expect to have enough cash to cover its nearly $700 million in owed debt as of Dec. 31.</p>
<p>The filing requests extra time to finalize its annual report and financial statements.</p>
<p>The statements “are being prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business,” according to the filing.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh-based retailer’s debt includes $154.7 million under convertible senior notes from 2015 and $441.5 million under a 2018 loan credit agreement which matures in May.</p>
<p>GNC shares have lately faltered and once again Monday briefly fell below $1.</p>
