<h1>With Toomey’s announcement, speculation begins for filling his Senate seat</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey’s de­ci­sion to ditch the po­lit­i­cal arena in 2022 and seek pri­vate em­ploy­ment has opened the flood­gates for in­sid­ers and ex­perts to spec­u­late about who should run to re­place him.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey said Mon­day that he sus­pects there will be “a num­ber of can­di­dates” who en­ter the field — and that’s not count­ing the many who will see an open­ing to run for Penn­syl­va­nia gov­er­nor, a pur­suit that the Re­pub­li­can ruled out.</p>
<p>To long­time GOP strat­e­gist Char­lie Ge­row in Har­ris­burg, Mr. Toomey is un­der­es­ti­mat­ing the cir­cus that’s about to roll into town.</p>
<p>“Right now, it’s the Har­ris­burg phone di­rec­tory that’s en­vi­sion­ing them­selves as ei­ther gov­er­nor or sen­a­tor,” Mr. Ge­row said.</p>
<p>Prob­a­bly half the con­gres­sio­nal del­e­ga­tion, a third of the state Leg­is­la­ture and var­i­ous county com­mis­sion­ers, busi­ness peo­ple, ac­a­dem­ics and at­tor­neys are mull­ing whether they should en­ter one of the con­tests, Mr. Ge­row said.</p>
<p>Though it’s far too early to nar­row a field that’s any­thing be­yond specu­la­tive, party of­fi­cials and Penn­syl­va­nia po­lit­i­cal gu­rus have be­gun de­vel­op­ing their wish lists, start­ing with names that — in many cases — have been ru­mored for years.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s va­cancy on the Senate ticket hasn’t yet re­vealed con­sen­sus fa­vor­ites for the GOP.</p>
<p>In­sid­ers have cited sev­eral Re­pub­li­can con­gress­men — from Fred Keller, R-Sny­der, and Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters, to Dan Meuser, R-Schuyl­kill, Mike Kelly, R-But­ler, and Glenn “G.T.” Thomp­son, R-Cen­tre — as po­ten­tial can­di­dates, as well as Scott Brady, U.S. at­tor­ney for the Western Dis­trict of Penn­syl­va­nia, and Wil­liam McSwain, U.S. at­tor­ney for the Eastern Dis­trict.</p>
<p>On the Demo­cratic side, names that have emerged in­clude Lt. Gov. John Fetter­man, At­tor­ney Gen­eral Josh Sha­piro — if he doesn’t run for gov­er­nor — and four first-term con­gress­women from the south­east, Su­san Wild, D-Le­high, Mary Gay Scan­lon, D-Del­a­ware, Chrissy Hou­la­han, D-Chester, and Made­leine Dean, D-Mont­gom­ery. Po­lit­i­cal afi­cio­na­dos also cite state Trea­surer Joe Torsella and U.S. Reps. Matt Cart­wright, D-Lack­awanna, and Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Leb­a­non, as pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
<p>Chris­to­pher Borick, di­rec­tor of Muhlen­berg Col­lege’s In­sti­tute of Pub­lic Opin­ion, said a suc­cess­ful state­wide can­di­date in Penn­syl­va­nia is not an “ideo­logue,” but a mod­er­ate.</p>
<p>“Other than the pres­i­dent, and then [for­mer U.S. Sen. Rick] San­to­rum in 2000, those po­lar­iz­ing Re­pub­li­can fig­ures ha­ven’t done well in the state,” Mr. Borick said. “Who’s done well over time? People like [for­mer Penn­syl­va­nia Gov.] Tom Ridge ... and it’s a dif­fer­ent world from when Ridge and [for­mer U.S. Sen.] John Heinz were win­ning elec­tions.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ge­row said the chief char­ac­ter­is­tic of a suc­cess­ful Senate can­di­date here is one who can raise “tons of money” for a cam­paign. Re­pub­li­cans want to field some­one who is not ex­tremely con­ser­va­tive, but right of cen­ter with broad ap­peal, he added — say­ing Mr. Toomey fit that bill.</p>
<p>“The most im­por­tant thing is that in or­der to gov­ern, you have to win an elec­tion,” Mr. Ge­row said. “I look for the con­ser­va­tive can­di­date who’s most vi­a­ble. That’s why I sup­ported Pat Toomey from the be­gin­ning.”</p>
<p>The prob­lem fac­ing mod­er­ate Re­pub­li­cans, Mr. Borick said, is that any can­di­date has to pass through a GOP pri­mary with a grow­ing num­ber of fairly ide­o­log­i­cal and en­gaged vot­ers, many of whom are now “firmly in the Trump camp.”</p>
<p>The model for Dem­o­crats, mean­while, is U.S. Sen. Bob Ca­sey, who has won three times in Penn­syl­va­nia and holds on to leg­acy Dem­o­crats while get­ting pro­gres­sive sup­port, Mr. Borick said.</p>
<p>Chad Baker, ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee mem­ber of the state Demo­cratic Party and chair of the York County Dem­o­crats, said Mr. Fetter­man tops his list for the Senate given his “fa­vor­a­bil­ity through­out the Com­mon­wealth.” Mr. Fetter­man — who was elected lieu­tenant gov­er­nor in 2018 — ran un­suc­cess­fully for the Senate in 2016, los­ing to Katie McGinty in the pri­mary.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker also noted that Penn­syl­va­nia has never elected a woman to the U.S. Senate, and that the con­gress­women from the south­east “have made names for them­selves in Con­gress and would be fan­tas­tic sen­a­tors for the state.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb, who first has to win his own re-elec­tion race against Re­pub­li­can Sean Par­nell this No­vem­ber be­fore con­sid­er­ing higher of­fice, is “level-headed” and has a mil­i­tary back­ground that would do well in a state with so many vet­er­ans, Mr. Borick said. He is some­one whom a lot of na­tional Dem­o­crats are keep­ing an eye on, he added.</p>
<p>With Mr. Toomey out of con­ten­tion for Penn­syl­va­nia gov­er­nor, Re­pub­li­cans are an­tic­i­pat­ing bids from a list of of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing for­mer gu­ber­na­to­rial can­di­dates Scott Wag­ner, Laura Ells­worth and Paul Mango, for­mer lieu­tenant gov­er­nor can­di­date Jeff Bar­tos, state Senate Ma­jor­ity Leader Jake Cor­man, for­mer state House Speaker Mike Turzai and for­mer U.S. Rep. Char­lie Dent, among oth­ers.</p>
<p>Sam DeMarco, chair of the Re­pub­li­can Com­mit­tee of Al­le­gheny County, said he hadn’t heard di­rectly from any can­di­date ex­press­ing in­ter­est, but that he’d con­sider Mr. Turzai, Mr. Thomp­son and state Sens. Mike Regan, R-York, and Doug Mas­tri­ano, R-Frank­lin, as vi­a­ble op­tions — as well as Mr. Mango, who “has the money to come back and say, ‘You guys screwed up with [Scott] Wag­ner last time, how about me?”</p>
<p>Mr. Wag­ner emerged from the GOP gu­ber­na­to­rial pri­mary in 2018 and lost to Gov. Tom Wolf in the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
<p>Demo­cratic wish lists are head­lined by Mr. Sha­piro and Mr. Fetter­man — if they don’t pur­sue the Senate.</p>
<p>For gov­er­nor, Mr. Baker said Mr. Sha­piro tops his list.</p>
<p>“He is well liked through­out the state, has worked dil­i­gently for un­der­rep­re­sented in­di­vid­u­als in Penn­syl­va­nia through his role as AG, and he has the name rec­og­ni­tion go­ing into the race that will be crit­i­cal,” Mr. Baker said.</p>
<p>Rick Tho­mas, chair of the Union County Demo­cratic Party, said Mr. Sha­piro “seems to have a pretty solid base to sup­port him.”</p>
<p>“Ob­vi­ously, much will be de­ter­mined af­ter the elec­tion next month, so all bets are off un­til we see how that plays out,” Mr. Tho­mas said.</p>
<p>“Ask me again around Dec. 1,” Mr. Tho­mas added in an email, with a smi­ley face emoji.</p>
