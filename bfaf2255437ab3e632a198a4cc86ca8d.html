<h1>Top-30 international pitching prospect Po-Yu Chen signs with Pirates</h1>

<p>Back at the 2020 trade deadline, the Pirates were thought to be sellers. As everyone knows now, they didn’t do much. Their only move was to send outfielder Jarrod Dyson to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for $243,300 in international bonus money for the 2019-20 pool.</p>
<p>Although underwhelming given the expectations, the use for that money is now known. The Pirates announced Wednesday they had signed 20-year-old Taiwanese right-hander Po-Yu Chen as a non-drafted free agent.</p>
<p>A source told&nbsp;the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s Jason Mackey that Chen was signed for $1.25 million, and with Chen’s projections as a prospect, that seems like it could be money well spent.</p>
<p>Chen played a strong role on the Chinese Taipei team that won the 2019 U-18 Baseball World Cup, pitching 14 total innings and allowing just two runs, good for a 1.29 ERA. He started two games, against Panama and Korea, earning the win in the latter appearance and earned a two-out save in the gold medal game against the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Fangraphs’ rankings, Chen is the 22nd-best international prospect for the 2019-20 pool and was the only member of Fangraphs’ top 40 international prospects that had yet to be signed.</p>
<p>“Po-Yu Chen is an exciting young pitching prospect who has been a prominent part of the Taiwanese national program and in international competition,” Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said in a statement. “He has good size, moves well on the mound, and has a quality pitch mix with the ability to keep getting better.&nbsp;We’ve scouted Po-Yu extensively and have received over 25 scouting reports over the last three years.&nbsp;In particular, our scout in Taiwan, Fu Chun Chiang, did a great job getting to know Po-Yu and his family and putting us in a position to sign him. I enjoyed meeting Po-Yu this week in Pittsburgh and we look forward to working with him in the years to come.”</p>
<p>Chen is a 6-foot-2, athletic right-hander whose main asset is his control. In 2019, his fastball sat around 89-91, and he featured both a slider and curve as breaking pitches, with the slider used a bit more frequently than the curve as an out pitch. According to a <a href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/a-dispatch-from-day-one-of-the-wbsc-u-18-world-cup/" target="_blank">Fangraphs report from 2019</a>, this control, along with his clean mechanics, made him a hot commodity among MLB scouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chen’s signing makes him the 48th player signed by the Pirates during the 2019-20 international signing period. The other main highlight of that list is right-hander Christopher Cruz from the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old Cruz signed with the Pirates in July, 2019 for $850,000, and is the 20th-ranked prospect in the 2019-20 pool by Fangraphs.</p>
