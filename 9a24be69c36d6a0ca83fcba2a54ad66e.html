<p>WASHINGTON — Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., announced Friday he had tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, with the test results suggesting he likely contracted the virus earlier this spring when he experienced&nbsp;mild flu-like symptoms and a low-grade fever.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey said he received blood test results Wednesday that showed “substantial levels” of COVID-19 antibodies, which are proteins that serve as indicators that the body successfully fended off the virus.</p>

<p>The levels of COVID-19 antibodies were high enough to allow him to donate blood plasma to potentially help those currently sickened with the virus, he said. Mr. Casey made his&nbsp;donation Friday at a plasma center in a shopping mall near his home in Scranton.</p>
<p>“What shocked me was just the huge number of antibodies I had,” Mr. Casey said&nbsp;in a phone interview Friday, “I had multiples more than the level you need to give plasma.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey said he began experiencing some symptoms&nbsp;in late March.&nbsp;At that time, he placed a phone call to his physician, who suggested he self-isolate at his home for two weeks. He came into contact with no one&nbsp;during that period,&nbsp;he said — his&nbsp;wife was in California to be with their daughter and son-in-law, who were expecting their first child.</p>
<p>“I came home to an empty house and it stayed that way for two weeks,” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey said his symptoms were relatively mild and manageable, so he decided against seeking medical care or a COVID-19 test at the time.</p>
<p>“At that time, there weren’t a lot of tests available,” he said. “Even if I’d thought, maybe it’s the right thing to do, well, you’re going to have to jump ahead of somebody.”</p>
<p>“I just never thought it was a good idea to leave the house to get a test when I wasn’t in any grave danger,” he said,&nbsp;adding that his doctors did not recommend seeking the test.</p>
<p>The fever went away on its own by mid-April, he said, and&nbsp;he remained able to work during his illness, remotely engaging with constituents and staff and keeping a full schedule.</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Casey said he consulted Brian Monahan, the Capitol’s attending physician, and received an antibody test to determine whether his earlier symptoms may have been the result of the virus.</p>
<p>“I encourage others who have recovered from COVID-19 to consult with their own physician to see if they may also be eligible to donate,” Mr. Casey said in a statement.</p>
<p>“I will continue to follow the guidance of public health experts by wearing a mask in public and observing social distancing practices, and I hope that others will do the same to help slow the spread of this virus.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey is the second member of Congress from Pennsylvania to have fallen ill.</p>
<p>Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/03/27/U-S-Rep-Mike-Kelly-butler-county-republican-tests-positive-COVID-19-pa/stories/202003270124" target="_blank">contracted the virus in late March</a> and suffered from body aches and loss of appetite that caused him to lose 30 pounds.

<p>Earlier this month, Mr. Kelly donated plasma as&nbsp;part of a national clinical trial to study whether blood containing antibodies for the disease can reduce the severity of the illness in patients receiving the plasma.</p>
