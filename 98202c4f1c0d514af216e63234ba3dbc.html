<h1>As Trump impeachment trial opens, senators brace for fight over witnesses</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump is scheduled to begin in earnest Tuesday with a debate among senators over whether to call witnesses who previously refused to testify and subpoena documents blocked by the president.</p>
<p>The Senate, conducting only the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, will consider a proposal unveiled this week by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, that calls for a quick proceeding.</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell’s proposal allows up to 24 hours for the six House managers, all Democrats, to present their case over the course of two sessions.&nbsp;Mr. Trump’s legal team — which includes Kenneth Starr, whose investigations led to former President Bill Clinton‘s 1999 impeachment trial — would have up to 24 hours over two sessions to present their arguments.</p>
<p>All 100 senators, who must sit quietly during the arguments, would then have up to 16 hours to question both sides.</p>
<p>Senators could consider calling witnesses or requesting documents, under Mr. McConnell’s proposal, only after the arguments and questioning is finished.</p>
<p>The proposed timeline prompted outcry from Senate Democrats, who have been calling for a more comprehensive trial including witness testimony.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats have demanded that former National Security Adviser John Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney testify.&nbsp;They have also asked for documents blocked by the Trump administration that would provide more information on the delay of nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine.</p>

<p>House Democrats, in a 10-week impeachment investigation last fall, charged Mr. Trump of abusing his office for&nbsp;demanding that Ukraine announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running against Mr. Trump in this year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>In December, the House of Representatives <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2019/12/18/Donald-Trump-impeachment-House-Congress-debate/stories/201912180102?cid=search" target="_blank">voted to impeach Mr. Trump</a> on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of justice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Senate’s debate on the rules governing the historic proceeding will set the stage for what could be an unpredictable trial.&nbsp;With Republicans controlling 53 seats in the chamber, Democrats hope to convince four Republicans to join their ranks on resolutions related to the trial’s structure.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called Mr. McConnell’s proposal “a national disgrace” in an interview with NPR on Tuesday.&nbsp;In a press conference in the U.S. Capitol, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Mr. McConnell’s proposal has made it “impossible to have a fair trial.”</p>
<p>The White House has deliberately blocked evidence, he added, that amounts to “a coverup, and the Senate should not make itself party to that.”</p>
<p>The final vote requires a two-thirds majority of senators to remove a president from office — a high bar that many experts have said remains highly unlikely. Both presidents who faced impeachment trials, President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Mr. Clinton in 1999, were acquitted.</p>
<p>In an argument filed on Monday, Mr. Trump's lawyers demanded the Senate on Monday to “swiftly reject” the impeachment charges and acquit him. The lawyers argued lawmakers would “permanently weaken the presidency” by removing Mr. Trump from office, characterizing charges by Democrats as politically charged.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s senators have been split on the issue.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, said in an interview last month he supported hearing from witnesses.&nbsp;“I think it’s reasonable to ask for witnesses to add to what is already a substantial and compelling record,” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican, said he supported waiting to consider testimony until after the arguments.</p>
<p>“I can imagine a scenario where it’s not necessary to call witnesses, but I don’t want to prejudge that,” he told reporters&nbsp; on Dec. 18, shortly before the House voted to impeach Mr. Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He added, “I think we know how this is going to end in the House, and we know how’s very likely to end in the Senate.”</p>
<p>Some prominent observers have criticized the Mr. McConnell’s proposals.</p>
<p>Ken Gormley, president of Duquesne University and an impeachment scholar, said the rules treat the trial as “a political game” in which Republicans try to deploy procedural tactics to gain an advantage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is not a game,” said Mr. Gormley, who traveled to Washington to attend the trial on Tuesday and had a coffee in Union Station before heading to the U.S. Capitol.&nbsp;Mr. Gormley attended Mr. Clinton’s impeachment trial 21 years ago and authored a book about it, called “The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr.”</p>
<p>Mr. Gormley said House Democrats had gathered a&nbsp;“significant body of evidence” that demonstrated Mr. Trump committed serious violations of his office. Senate Republicans were trying to bury the evidence in an unprecedented way, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House legal team’s arguments related to Mr. Trump’s executive privilege and claiming absolute power over foreign matters had been repeatedly struck down by the courts, Mr. Gormley said.</p>
<p>The White House’s lawyers “have to know those arguments, while interesting academic exercises, are losing arguments,” he said.</p>
<p>Though some experts think Mr. Trump’s acquittal is all but certain, Mr. Gormley said it could be a wild ride.&nbsp;If public perception shifts in states governed by moderate Republicans, those senators could shift their votes.</p>
<p>“The only thing that is certain about an impeachment trial is that it is uncertain,” Mr. Gormley said.&nbsp;</p>
