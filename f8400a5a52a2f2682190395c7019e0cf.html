<h1>AHN bans visitors to facilities because of COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Because of the evolving threat of the COVID-19 outbreak, Allegheny Health Network said that starting at 7 p.m. Thursday it will suspend patient visits to its hospitals, outpatient clinics and ambulatory surgery centers&nbsp;“until further notice.”</p>
<p>AHN said in a press release that the ban on visitors —&nbsp;which has four small exceptions — is part of&nbsp;“its ongoing efforts to help prevent the spread of illness in the community related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and protect the health of hospitalized patients and their caregivers.”</p>
<p>The exceptions to the no-visitation rule is that two people at a time may visit patients in the following areas: labor and delivery; neonatal intensive care units; pediatrics; and end-of-life care.</p>
<p>The few visitors allowed in will be screened under a policy AHN <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2020/03/16/Allegheny-Health-Network-coronavirus-brian-parker-covid-19-pittsburgh/stories/202003160071" target="_blank">enacted three days ago</a>, requiring that visitors be asked questions about recent travel and possible COVID-19 symptoms of a cough or fever.</p>
<p>“Those who answer yes to either question will not be allowed to enter the facility,” AHN said.</p>
<p>Visiting hours at hospitals is limited to just 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and only visitors age 18 and older are permitted.</p>
<p>Another small exception is that people who accompany others to an ambulatory surgery center or outpatient clinic, “will be asked to wait in their cars or some other external location until they are called to pick up the patient,” AHN said.</p>
<p>“We understand that visitation restrictions are difficult for both our patients and their loved ones, but we hope that everyone understands the gravity of the public health crisis that we are experiencing and that they appreciate that the steps we are taking are in the best interests of everyone at this time,” said Brian Parker, MD, AHN’s chief quality and learning officer.</p>
