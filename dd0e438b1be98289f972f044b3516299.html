<h1>Butler's Devin Carney has taken his scoring to extremes in postseason</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ethan Morton’s versatility is on the extreme end, with Butler’s senior point guard averaging close to a triple-double. When it came to scoring, though, Morton had a swell sidekick in Devin Carney.</p>
<p>In the regular season, Morton averaged 23 points a game and Carney 20. But since the playoffs started, Carney hasn’t just been along for the ride. He has taken his scoring to extremes.</p>
<p>Carney has been Devin from heaven in the postseason. He is one of the reasons Butler won the WPIAL Class 6A championship and advanced to the second round of the PIAA playoffs. In four postseason games, Carney, a 6-foot sophomore guard, is averaging 50 percent more points than he did in the regular season. He has been good for 30 points a contest and helped Butler’s cardiac kids win three overtime games in the postseason.</p>
<p>When Butler plays Upper St. Clair at 7 p.m. Wednesday in a PIAA second-round game at North Allegheny, Carney certainly will be one of the players to watch, especially since Morton has been nursing a sprained right ankle sustained Saturday in a PIAA first-round win against Central Dauphin. This game has been highly anticipated since Butler beat Upper St. Clair, 83-78, in a terrific WPIAL semifinal that went to overtime.</p>
<p>“To me, he’s an incredibly dynamic offensive player,” Upper St. Clair coach Danny Holzer said of Carney. “His long-range spot shooting is impressive, he scores getting to the rim, but he also scores on pull-ups. He scores on all three levels consistently.”</p>
<p>Morton still has been the leader of Butler’s team in the postseason in terms of all-around play, averaging 25 points and registering a triple-double against Central Dauphin. But Carney’s scoring has been vital for Butler. He has scored 22 points against Peters Township, 35 against Upper St. Clair, 24 against Mt. Lebanon and 39 against Central Dauphin.</p>
<p>“Averaging 30 points a game in the playoffs in Class 6A is one heck of a feat,” Holzer said. “Especially playing teams like us and Mt. Lebanon because I think we’re two teams that play pretty tough defense.”</p>
<p><strong>Ticket information</strong></p>
<p>The Butler-Upper St. Clair game has made for a hot ticket. Here’s an example: Butler had 250 tickets to sell to adults Monday, starting at 11 a.m. Butler athletic director Bill Mylan said 60-70 people already were lined up at 9:30 to buy tickets, and all 250 were sold in a half-hour.</p>
<p>When Butler played Upper St. Clair in the WPIAL semifinals as part of a Class 6A doubleheader at Robert Morris’ UPMC Events Center, the crowd was 3,500. For whatever reason, the game will not be played at a college venue this time.</p>
<p>North Allegheny has one of the larger gyms in the WPIAL, with capacity at a little more than 2,200. Although Butler sold its allotment of 250 Monday, the school is getting 250 more adult tickets from the PIAA that will go on sale Tuesday at the school, starting at 1 p.m. Upper St. Clair also had 250 adult tickets to sell Monday and almost 200 were sold by the end of the. Upper St. Clair will get 250 more to sell Tuesday, starting at 8 a.m.</p>
<p>Upper St. Clair and Butler also have 250 student tickets to sell and some student tickets still remain at both schools.</p>
<p>North Allegheny is not selling tickets until the night of the game, but North Allegheny athletic director Bob Bozzuto said 500-700 tickets will go on sale starting at 6 p.m. Wednesday. Those who already bought tickets will not be allowed into the school until 6 p.m. on game night.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I haven’t ever seen anything like this,” Butler athletic director Bill Mylan said of the ticket sales. “But we’ve had such a supportive community that has rallied around these guys that it doesn’t surprise me. Unfortunately, if the game stays at NA, it’s limited on who can come to watch.”</p>
<p><strong>Colts for the record</strong></p>
<p>The Chartiers Valley girls will be trying to set a WPIAL record for longest winning streak when they play Hollidaysburg Wednesday night at Hempfield. Chartiers Valley has won 56 in a row to tie the WPIAL record, set by North Catholic from 1987-89. Even if Chartiers Valley wins, it can’t break the state record this season for the longest winning streak. Lancaster Catholic won 62 in a row from 2017-19 before losing in the 2019 PIAA quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Chartiers Valley’s domination during the 56 wins is eye-opening. The Colts have won 33 of the 56 games by at least 20 points, including 23 by 30 or more. Only 10 opponents have come within 10 points of Chartiers Valley</p>
<p><strong>1 vs. 2 showdown</strong></p>
<p>One of the best games in any classification in the second round is Vincentian (21-4) against Berlin Brothersvalley (26-1) in Class 1A. In the final state rankings before the postseason, Vincentian was ranked No. 1 in Class 1A and Berlin Brothersvalley No. 2.</p>
<p>Vincentian will have a size advantage and will face a Berlin Brothersvalley team that likes a fast pace, scoring 77.4 points a game. Berlin Brothersvalley, which lost in the second round a year ago, likes to shoot 3-pointers. The Mountaineers attempt an average of 24 a game and make 8.5. They have made 45 3-pointers in the past four games.</p>
<p>Berlin Brothersvalley features 5-11 junior guard Elijah Sechler, who averages 18 points a game and has made 81 3-pointers.</p>
