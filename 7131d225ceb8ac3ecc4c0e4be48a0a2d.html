<p>Two children were hospitalized and a dog and cat were killed Friday morning in a fire that erupted at a home in Rankin, Allegheny County emergency officials said.</p>
<p>Emergency crews responded just after 9 a.m. to Jackson Street, where a home was “fully engulfed” in flames due to a fire that may have started in the kitchen, according to Rankin Police Chief Ryan Wooten. A 6-year-old girl and 4-year-old boy who were inside the home were taken to UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh due to smoke inhalation. They are expected to survive.</p>
<p>The kids were home with a babysitter and her boyfriend while the children’s mother was at work, Chief Wooten said.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;Yorkshire Terrier and a cat were killed in the fire, he said.</p>
<p>“We learned the kids were trapped inside, but they were out of the house by the time we got there,” he said. Fire officials had put out the fire as of 11 a.m., but were still on scene checking for hot spots.&nbsp;</p>
