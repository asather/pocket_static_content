<h1>All life-sustaining businesses must follow new state order requiring masks for employees</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>All life-sustaining businesses that are still operating in Pennsylvania must follow a new state order that requires all employees to wear masks while at the work site, based on new information from the state department of health Friday.</p>
<p>The order, which went into effect Wednesday and will be enforced starting Sunday evening, laid out guidelines for life-sustaining businesses that are still operating, including how employees can maintain a social distance during work, how businesses can maintain mitigation and cleaning protocols and how a company should respond if it has been exposed to a probable or confirmed case of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Among many other guidelines, the order stated employers must enforce workers and customers to wear a mask while on the premises. For its employees, businesses must provide masks or approve a covering obtained or made by the worker.</p>
<p>The order applies to all life-sustaining businesses, not just those that directly interact with customers or serve the public.</p>
<p>“We want anyone who’s out to wear a mask,” state health secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said Friday. “My mask protects you, your mask protects me so if you’re a life sustaining business but you’re not seeing customers you still have employees there and we want to protect the employees from the other employees.”</p>
<p>“So everyone’s wearing a mask and that offers the best protection so we want that to happen at all businesses,” Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>The order will be enforced by several state agencies, including the Pennsylvania state police and local officials, but Dr. Levine said the administration does not plan to send the police to businesses to check that they are complying.</p>
<p>“Our administration feels that people will want to do the right thing and they will do the right thing,” Dr. Levine said. “So we’re not going to send the Pa. state police out to go enforce that a business is wearing a mask. But we expect - I mean this is for the protection of the public - that they’ll do it.”</p>
<p>Businesses that do not comply with the requirements listed in the order could face citations, fines or license suspensions, according to a press release announcing the order Wednesday.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the state said the order applied only to businesses that interacted with customers. Life-sustaining businesses that did not directly serve the public should take proper precautions to protect themselves but are not required to follow the order, the state department of health said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the state clarified that the order did apply to all life-sustaining businesses that are still operating.</p>
<p>For businesses that do serve the public, employers must deny entry to individuals not wearing masks, unless the company is providing medication, medical supplies or food. In those cases, the business must offer alternative options, like pick-up or delivery of goods.</p>
<p>Individuals who cannot wear a mask due to a medical condition, including children the age of two years, can enter the premises without providing medical documentation, according to the press release.</p>
<p>The state has stressed that people do not need to wear a medical mask because those are needed for health care workers and first responders. Instead, the state recommends people wear cloth face coverings or make their own masks.</p>
