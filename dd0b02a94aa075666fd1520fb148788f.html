<p><strong>#MakeingaDifference:</strong> Volunteers, school representatives and United Way staffers celebrated the United Way’s Be a Middle School Mentor program during an appreciation dinner at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center on Thursday night. The 10-year-old program has made a positive impact on the lives of students and mentors. “I love it,” said Ariana Brazier, a mentor for the last two years at Woodland Hills Intermediate School.&nbsp;Melvin Hubbard El, a chief of staff for state Rep. Ed Gainey, said mentoring for the last seven years has been rewarding.</p>
<p>“When people &nbsp;are willing to spend time and dedicate their own time to working with young people, it makes a difference,” said Rodney Necciai, assistant superintendent for Pittsburgh Public Schools. “Many of our young people thrive on those types of relationships and that one-on-one time that helps them nurture their hopes and dreams, it empowers them,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bobbi Watt Geer, CEO of United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania, welcomed everyone and thanked them for their support. Kelleigh Boland, program officer at Jefferson Regional Foundation, thanked the mentors and noted how important mentors were in her childhood and young adulthood.&nbsp;“They made a huge difference.” “We have found that more kids are coming to school and doing better in their classes and they are building great relationships with the mentors,” said Damon Bethea, the United Way’s mentoring project director.</p>
