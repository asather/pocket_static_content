<h1>As virus concerns grow, here's a list of when and where can you shop for groceries</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The spread of the new coronavirus and the COVID-19 disease has caused growing panic among residents who are being asked to self-isolate, as nonessential businesses like restaurants and bars have been forced to close their doors around the country.</p>
<p>As citizens rush to grocery stores and wipe-out shelves stocking up on food and toiletries, several major food marts have adjusted store hours in response to high-demand to allow time to restock shelves, while following social-distancing guidelines handed down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a list of hours in which major supermarkets and discount stores will be operating during the coronavirus pandemic:</p>
<p><strong>Aldi</strong></p>
<p><strong>9 a.m.-7 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Aldi announced Tuesday that the discount store <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/2020/03/17/Aldi-stores-change-hours-amid-the-COVID-19-pandemic/stories/202003170075" target="_blank">will be limiting its store hours</a> from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. to allow for more efficient restocking and cleaning. Aldi also said it would place a limit on select items.</p>
<p><strong>Costco Wholesale</strong></p>
<p><strong>Normal business hours</strong></p>
<p>Costco Wholesale is operating under normal business hours amid the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; However&nbsp;President and CEO Craig Jelinek said in an email sent to its members obtained by the Post-Gazette that the box chain&nbsp;has “taken steps to control the number of members in our warehouses and asked that members and employees practice social distancing.”</p>
<p><strong>Dollar General</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing one hour early; First hour dedicated to senior shoppers</strong></p>
<p>Dollar General Corp. announced Monday that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2020/03/17/Dollar-General-dedicate-first-hour-senior-customers/stories/202003170060" target="_blank">the store is dedicating the first hour of each shopping day</a> to senior shoppers, who are most at-risk for health issues if they contract the virus. The store also said that starting Tuesday, all stores will close one hour earlier than current closing times so that employees can properly clean and restock the shelves.&nbsp;Normal operating hours vary by individual store locations and can be found <a href="http://www2.dollargeneral.com/About-Us/pages/storelocator.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dollar Tree/Family Dollar</strong></p>
<p><strong>Normal business hours&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Dollar Tree store, which acquired Family Dollar in 2015, had yet to announce any changes to its normal business hours as of Wednesday amid the COVID-19 outbreak. However the discount brand posted an alert to its website telling customers it has temporarily suspended online ordering due to “unprecedented demand.” Store hours vary by location. Check with the store nearest you for hours of operation.</p>
<p><strong>Giant Eagle/Market District/GetGo</strong></p>
<p><strong>7 a.m.-10 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Giant Eagle <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/03/14/covid-19-coronavirus-closings-pittsburgh/stories/202003140041" target="_blank">reduced store operating hours</a> on Sunday for all locations, including Market Districts and stores that were once open 24-7.&nbsp;Adjacent GetGo stores will have the same hours as well as the chain’s curbside delivery service.&nbsp;Standalone GetGo gas stations will function as normal.</p>
<p><strong>Kuhn’s Quality Foods Market</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adjusted hours vary by location</strong></p>
<p>Kuhn’s Quality Foods Market, a family-owned chain of grocery stores in Pittsburgh, has adjusted store hours at individual store locations. The new temporary hours are as follows:&nbsp;Bellevue, Banksville Road, Ferguson, McKnight Road, Beulah Road and Hopewell open from 8 a.m.-10 p.m.;&nbsp;Highwood: 8 a.m.-6 p.m.;&nbsp;Ingomar: 9 a.m.-9 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Sam’s Club</strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday-Saturday: 9 a.m.-8 p.m.; Sunday: 10 a.m.-6 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Starting Tuesday, Sam’s Club enforced limited hours to ensure employees had time to restock and sanitize each club location. The club kept its Sunday hours the same. Preschedule pickup orders will be available for pickup starting at 7 a.m., the store said on its website.</p>
<p><strong>Save A Lot</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adjusted hours vary by location</strong></p>
<p>Save A Lot announced <a href="https://savealot.com/save-lot-community-updates" target="_blank">on its website</a> Sunday that it is adjusting opening hours in some locations and instructed customers to check their local stores for details. The chain also placed temporary limits on some items as associates work to restock shelves.</p>
<p><strong>Shop ’n Save</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adjusted hours vary by location</strong></p>
<p>Because Shop ‘n Save is independently owned and operated, hours vary by location and a majority of stores have chosen to truncate their hours at this time, according to a statement from Bill Lipsky, vice president for Shop ‘n Save’s Pittsburgh division.&nbsp;“We support all retailers in their decisions to adjust hours according to community, employee and customer needs, prioritizing health and safety for all,” Mr. Lipsky said. The grocery chain had a message <a href="https://www.shopnsavefood.com/Pages/18892/COVID-19%20Information" target="_blank">on its website</a> that lists steps Shop ‘n Save is taking to keep customers and employees safe, including offering a&nbsp;“Leave at My Door Delivery” feature to its&nbsp;Instacart Delivery and Pickup service.</p>
<p><strong>Target - All stores to close at 9 p.m.; First hour of every Wednesday dedicated to&nbsp;“vulnerable guests.”</strong></p>
<p>Starting Wednesday, all Target stores will close their doors at 9 p.m., the mega-retailer announced <a href="https://corporate.target.com/about/purpose-history/our-commitments/target-coronavirus-hub" target="_blank">on its website</a>. Target is also reserving the first hour of operations on each Wednesday to&nbsp;“vulnerable guests” who it classifies as elderly citizens, and those with underlying health concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Fresh Market</strong></p>
<p><strong>Normal business hours; First hour designated toward seniors and at-risk shoppers.</strong></p>
<p>The Fresh Market, a national chain based out of Greensboro, NC with a location in Mt. Lebanon, said it would designate 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. as a window for seniors and others who are at-risk to shop. The Mt. Lebanon store is operating under normal business hours of 8 a.m.-9 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Trader Joe’s</strong></p>
<p><strong>9 a.m.-7 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>On Monday, Trader Joe’s implemented new temporary hours of 9 a.m.-7 p.m, opening an hour later and closing three hours earlier than normal business hours. The company said <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/announcement/revised-store-hours-for-all-trader-joes-locations" target="_blank">in an announcement </a>that it was restricting hours to&nbsp;“support our Crew Members in taking care of one another and our customers.”</p>
<p><strong>Walmart</strong></p>
<p><strong>6 a.m.-11 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>Beginning Sunday, Walmart changed its hours to 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. until further notice, including the many locations that are typically open 24 hours.&nbsp;Walmart locations which typically operate under more restricted hours, such as closing at 10 p.m. or opening at 7 a.m., will not be affected by the change.</p>
<p><strong>Whole Foods Market</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing up to two hours early; Servicing customers 60+ an hour before opening.</strong></p>
<p>Whole Foods Market said starting Wednesday, all stores will be adjusting hours depending on each location. The grocery chain also promised to open an hour early to service&nbsp;customers who are 60 and older before opening to the public. Whole Foods said stores will close up to two hours early to give team members time to restock shelves.
