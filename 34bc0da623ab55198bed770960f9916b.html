<h1>Police pursuit of stolen vehicle ends in crash</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two people were hospitalized after a 15-year-old driving in a stolen vehicle crashed into another vehicle following a police pursuit.</p>
<p>Authorities said a driver in a stolen silver Kia Forte was being followed around 9:30 a.m. by Middlesex Township Police when they attempted a traffic stop on State Route 8 and Dickey Road.</p>
<p>The officer at the stop told the driver to stop, but the car drove around the police car, Allegheny County Police officials said. The Middlesex officer fired his gun “approximately four times” into the left rear tire in an attempt to disable the car.</p>
<p>The driver evaded the stop and drove southbound for less than a mile before it collided with a Toyota Highlander at the intersection of Route 8 and Route 910, police said. A 64-year-old woman in the Toyota was transported to the hospital in stable condition.</p>
<p>The 15-year-old driver was also hospitalized in stable condition.</p>
<p>The investigation is ongoing, and will be reviewed by the Allegheny County District Attorney’s office.</p>
