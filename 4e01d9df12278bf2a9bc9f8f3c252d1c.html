<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Mattress Factory museum on the North Side has received a nearly $210,000 grant to digitize the archive of the late artist Greer Lankton.</p>
<p>Born a boy, Lankton had sexual reassignment surgery at the age of 21. The&nbsp;artist worked in New York City’s East Village in the 1980s,&nbsp;creating lifelike, sewn dolls posed in elaborate, theatrical settings. The dolls, modeled on friends or celebrities, could be glamorous and grotesque. Lankton was 38 when she died in 1996.</p>
<p>The Arlington, Va.-based Council on Library and Information Resources gave the Mattress Factory $209,527 to digitize more than 14,000 items, including artworks, dolls, objects, papers and the artist’s press clippings.</p>
<p>The contemporary art museum, which has a Lankton installation on the third floor, has hired a second archivist, Sinead Bligh, to help digitize the archive. Museum spokeswoman Mandy Wilson said the goal is to complete digitization by the end of 2021 and make it available online.</p>
