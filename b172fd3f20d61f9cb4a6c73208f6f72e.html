<h1>Federal rule change for international students criticized by higher-ed groups </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As if a pandemic and resulting recession weren’t enough uncertainty for colleges and their students this fall, now there’s this: Foreign learners may be ordered out of the country if their school begins with or switches to online-only learning.</p>
<p>The policy change covering international students, announced by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is drawing sharp criticism across higher education. Leaders say it will drive away some of the 1-million-plus students who study in the U.S. and further strain colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Many of them lost tens of millions of dollars in March when students were sent home to curb COVID-19. In the months since, those schools have tried to thread a needle through the virus’ unpredictable spread, students’ reluctance to pay full tuition for remote instruction, and equal reticence among others including some faculty to return to campuses given health risks.</p>

<p>Colleges have braced for the possibility of significant enrollment losses. Even such schools as the University of Pittsburgh, which has seen encouraging signs in indicators like fall deposits, nevertheless say international enrollment remains a big question mark, given virus-related travel complications and visa restrictions.</p>
<p>Pitt and its chancellor, Patrick Gallagher, are among those recently announcing fall plans intended to let them quickly pivot between varying degrees of in-person and online instruction, depending on the virus’ severity this fall.</p>
<p>“Yesterday’s federal policy change is misguided and unfair to international students, harmful to higher education across the United States, and damaging to both regional and national economies,” Pitt spokesman Kevin Zwick said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The university, he said, is contacting students to explain to them how best to adjust their studies so as to meet the revised rules.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is the sixth-leading host state for foreign students in the U.S. at 51,818, according to the Institute of International Education in New York City. Pitt alone has about 4,300 international students, according to the most recent Institute of International Education report.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during" target="_blank">announced changes</a> are to exemptions in The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) that gave students more flexibility in the spring to take online courses. Officials with ICE could not immediately be reached Tuesday for further explanation of the rationale for Monday’s changes.</p>
<p>Among them:&nbsp;“Nonimmigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States. The U.S. Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will U.S. Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States.”</p>
<p>The agency said students in the U.S. “enrolled in such programs must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status” or face potential consequences, including removal proceedings.</p>
<p>“Nonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools adopting a hybrid model—that is, a mixture of online and in person classes—will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online,” the government said.&nbsp;“These schools must certify&nbsp;… that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program,” the agency said.</p>
<p>Higher-education groups lined up to urge the government to reconsider, including the Association of American Universities, comprised of 65 leading research institutions. They include Pitt and Carnegie Mellon University, whose provost James Garrett Jr. <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/leadership/the-provost/campus-comms/2020/2020-07-07.html" target="_blank">called the policy change</a> “unacceptably abrupt, inflexible, and completely disregarding of the difficulties it causes our students from abroad.”</p>
<p>The association’s president, Mary Sue Coleman, called the change “deeply cruel” to international students.</p>
<p>“It is also likely to do further damage to our nation’s universities, which are already struggling with unprecedented uncertainty … [and] massive logistical complications,” she said. “In particular, the impact on international graduate students and undergraduate students already in the United States will be devastating, causing massive disruptions in their learning and research.”</p>
<p>Ted Mitchell, president of the Washington, D.C.-based American Council on Education, said institutions are trying to reopen amid unprecedented circumstances. “We need flexibility,” he said.</p>
<p>More than 80% of colleges and universities plan in-person classes this fall or a hybrid with some online instruction, according to a <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/Here-s-a-List-of-Colleges-/248626" target="_blank">Chronicle of Higher Education survey.</a> However, some schools including Harvard and Princeton universities recently announced that most instruction will occur remotely.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is pushing for schools to reopen.</p>
<p>Penn State University’s 9,396 international students made it this state’s leading host institution, followed by&nbsp;8,669 at Carnegie Mellon; 7,062 at the University of Pennsylvania; 4,339 at Pitt; and 3,627 at Temple University, according to IIE’s annual Open Doors report, released in November.</p>
