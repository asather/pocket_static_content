<h1>Buying Here: One of Castle Shannon's oldest houses is priced at $179,000</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The house at <strong>3191 McRoberts Road</strong>&nbsp;in Castle Shannon had just been flipped by another owner when Diane Nath toured it. She didn’t care.</p>
<p>“The doors and frames are all original,” she said.&nbsp;“The pillars in the front of the house are all original pieces.”</p>
<p>Built in 1900, the two-story house near the top of a hill overlooking Route 88&nbsp;is one of the oldest in Castle Shannon. Ms. Noth enjoyed it for 10 years, but she now has put it on the market for&nbsp;$179,000 (MLS No. 1426498) with Angela Watson of Century 21 American Heritage Realty (<a href="https://www.century21.com/property/3191-mcroberts-rd-castle-shannon-pa-15234-C2181683876?k=1" target="_blank">www.century21.com</a> or 724-335-4700). It is open by appointment.</p>
<p>The original front porch and some gingerbread trim are still intact. The exterior is covered in vinyl siding.</p>
<p>Inside, 9-foot ceilings add a spacious feel to the 1,800-square-foot home.&nbsp;Ms. Nath added hardwood floors.</p>
<p>The 18-by-15-foot living room features an original built-in storage cabinet. All of the woodwork is painted white, and the walls are a light green.</p>
<p>The 15-by-13-foot dining room has a decorative fireplace with a rich stained wood mantel, granite hearth and original black iron insert. The window trim is all original and features rosette corners.</p>
<p>A updated kitchen measures 15 by 12 feet and has an L-shaped layout, oak cabinets and laminate counter tops. An original pie cabinet has glass-front upper doors, two drawers and lower storage. There is room for an eat-in table in the fresh blue space with white wainscoting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are full bathrooms on the first and second floors. Ms. Nath believes the second floor was added later. It contains three bedrooms: a master measuring 18 by 15 feet and two others that both measure 15 by 15 feet. The carpeted master bedroom has an attached full bathroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The backyard is one of Ms. Nath’s favorite features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We love the huge yard. There is a also a patio that we built,” she said.</p>
<p>The patio has brick pavers and a 48-inch-tall retaining wall. The backyard has lots of room for parties and mature trees for shade and privacy. There is a parking pad that can hold two vehicles and space for two more in front on the street.</p>
<p>The home has forced-air heat and a laundry in the basement. Although the basement is unfinished, Ms. Nath installed an Everdry waterproofing system when she moved in. Its warranty is transferable to the new owners.</p>
<p>The property’s Allegheny County assessed value is $119,500. Over the past four years, five houses have sold in the 3100 block of McRoberts Road for prices ranging from $35,280 in May 2017 to $135,000 in November 2016 (<a href="/www2.county.allegheny.pa.us" target="_blank">www2.county.allegheny.pa.us</a>).</p>
<p>“We are in walking distance from the municipal park. My daughter played softball up there,” Ms. Nath said.&nbsp;“There is a little playground for the kids. It’s a nice location.”</p>
