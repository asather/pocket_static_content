<h1>Duquesne hangs on to beat La Salle, 71-69</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While Duquesne coach Keith Dambrot is hesitant to say that any one game is more important than another, the Dukes needed a win against La Salle on Sunday.</p>
<p>Thanks to three straight losses against Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Dayton, it had been since Jan. 15 — 18 days — that Duquesne had won. So it needed to get a win to get back on the right schedule.</p>
<p>For much of the game, that looked like an inevitability. The Dukes held a 12-point lead at one time and looked to be in control. But the Explorers’ press defense at the end of the game gave Duquesne enough trouble that La Salle was able to crawl back into things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With less than 30 seconds left, the Dukes’ lead had evaporated to just three points, and the Explores had the ball with a chance to tie the game. La Salle guard David Beatty ended up with the ball, and Duquesne guard Sincere Carry went to foul him on purpose with 1.1 seconds remaining. But he went too late, and the referees deemed that Beatty was in the act of shooting, awarding him with three free throws.</p>
<p>But Beatty couldn’t do the job, missing two of his three free throws, allowing the Dukes (16-5 overall, 6-3 A10) to escape with a much-needed, 71-69 win.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>Duquesne’s large lead built up by hitting timely shots, including eight 3-pointers in total. Junior guard Tavian Dunn-Martin hit several important threes, as did sophomore guard Lamar Norman Jr. The Dukes finished 34.8% from beyond the arc, which isn’t an outstandingly high rate, but it’s an improvement for Duquesne, who has struggled to get things going from deep this season.</p>
<p>Beyond that, junior forward Marcus Weathers paced the scoring with 18, while Carry tied a career high with nine assists.</p>
<p>“Just moving the ball and making the extra pass,” Carry said.&nbsp;“We shared the ball well tonight, and everybody got to their spots. So we had a successful offense because of that.”</p>
<p>The first half was defined by what Duquesne accomplished on the defensive end. With 8:36 remaining, La Salle’s Ayinde Hikim hit a lay-in to make it 21-19. Over the next 5:25, the Explorers (10-11, 1-8) didn’t score another point. The Dukes prevented any real open looks, and La Salle missed all seven of its shots over that span, while also turning the ball over three times.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Duquesne went on an 8-0 run to open up a 27-21 lead with 4:48 to go in the half.</p>
<p>The Dukes’ offense came from everywhere. Every player who got time in the first half scored. Weathers and Carry had seven each to lead the way, while Dunn-Martin and Norman Jr., had six a piece. All of that added up to a 36-29 Duquesne lead at the halftime break.</p>
<p>That lead persisted well into the second half before the Explorers made things interesting at the end. The Dukes won’t necessarily care about that, though. They needed a win and they got it.</p>
