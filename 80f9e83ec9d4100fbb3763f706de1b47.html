<h1>Study finds that cleaner, healthier air is social distancing side benefit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Social distancing, for all the longing for human contact it has inspired, has worked to flatten COVID-19’s infectious curve.</p>
<p>Now, as counties and states are moving to reopen restaurants, bars and other mingling places, a new study finds the recent stay-at-home months have also prevented hundreds of premature deaths and saved billions of dollars due to reduced exposure to fossil fuel emissions from vehicles and power plants.</p>
<p>The study found that because personal vehicle travel dropped by 40% and electricity usage fell by 6% in March and April, premature mortality from air pollution was likely down 25%, resulting in approximately 720 fewer deaths over the two months.</p>

<p>“Our work provides insights into the benefits and costs of policies related to social distancing, which has resulted in unprecedented changes in society and in economic activity,” said study co-author Nicholas Muller, associate professor of economics, engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business.</p>
<p>He emphasized that the study was not claiming that the coronavirus was in any way beneficial to society, but rather it explores how much air quality and public health are dependent on a more or less energy-intensive environment.</p>
<p>“We hope the study can be used to assess the benefits that come from reduced use of these technologies,” Mr. Muller said.</p>
<p>Social distancing reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 46 million metric tons a month due to the reduced travel, a 19% decline. And the national environmental benefits of social distancing were calculated at $5.5 billion a month, the study found, 60% of that from the reduced deaths and most of those in larger urban areas.</p>
<p>The study, titled&nbsp;<a href="/%20file:/C:/Users/dhope/Downloads/NBER%20-%20Muller.pdf" target="_blank">“Expected Health Effects of Reduced Air Pollution From COVID-19,”</a>&nbsp;was published in May as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. It has not yet been peer reviewed.</p>
<p>The researchers used cellphone data, reported daily for every county in the U.S., to measure changes in mobility and studied hourly electricity use data by region to estimate changes in electricity consumption. They then looked at the reduced emissions from travel and electricity production and connected those to reduced exposure to fine air particles and expected reductions in health impacts and mortality.</p>
<p>Mr. Muller said the reduced use of vehicles for the two months was a bigger factor in the air-quality improvements than reduced electricity usage.</p>
<p>The 28-page paper states that there is established science linking health problems to air pollution, so it’s possible to gauge the effects of reducing that exposure on public health. Quantifying that impact is “an important input in an economic analysis of social distancing.”</p>
<p>“[O]ur work demonstrated the degree to which stay-at-home measures reduced reliance on fossil-fuel-based transportation and power generation to benefit public health,” said Steve Cicala, assistant professor at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, another study co-author. “Our findings are relevant not just for the current time but also in the context of a post-COVID-19 economy in which remote work and retail delivery may be more common.”</p>
<p>Authors of the study — which was partially funded by the Political Economics Initiative at the University of Chicago’s Becker Friedman Institute — acknowledge the study’s limitations, including uncertainties in linking emissions to exposures and estimations of future monetary impacts.</p>
<p>“And I really would have liked to keep going with measuring emissions and impacts as the country comes out of the lockdowns,” Mr. Muller said, “but we also just wanted to get it out there.”</p>
<p>In addition to Mr. Muller and Mr. Cicala, other contributors to the study were from the University of North Carolina, Greensboro; Dartmouth College; and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
