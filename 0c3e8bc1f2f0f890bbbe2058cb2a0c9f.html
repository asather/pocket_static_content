<h1>Penguins prospects Samuel Poulin, Pierre-Olivier Joseph look to make the most of camp invites</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last September, the Penguins sent Samuel Poulin, after an encouraging couple of weeks of training camp, back to his junior hockey team with a message.</p>
<p>“You never know when your turn is going to be,” Poulin, a 2019 first-round draft pick, recalled Thursday. “So just prepare yourself for any opportunity.”</p>
<p>That opportunity came a little earlier than expected for the 19-year-old, who is widely regarded as one of the organization’s top two or three prospects.</p>
<p>This winter, Poulin was among the most productive players in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. The power winger bullied his way to 16 goals and 40 points in 21 games from Jan. 1 on. That included a stretch with at least three points in five straight games for Sherbrooke Phoenix, the QMJHL’s top team.</p>
<p>“Our team chemistry was really good so that helped a lot through the year,” he said. “We had a tremendous team. ... I give a lot of credit to my team, too.”</p>
<p>Poulin, who predominantly played left wing in juniors this past season but says he is also comfortable on the right side, was pressed further to identify areas where he improved since we last saw him in Pittsburgh, at his first NHL camp.</p>
<p>“I think I didn’t really change much. I’m a powerful guy and I can move the puck and play some offense, too,” he said. “I don’t think my game really changed much. But with a year more of experience, I’m more developed physically, too, so I think it’s helping me so far. I think that’s pretty much the difference.”</p>
<p>In March, Poulin got the disappointing news that the QMJHL season was being called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. About three months later, he got a call from the Penguins, who told him that his next opportunity had arrived.</p>
<p>The Penguins would add Poulin, the son of former NHLer Patrick Poulin, to their roster for Phase 3 of the NHL’s return-to-play plan. Unfortunately, he didn’t get on the ice at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex until Monday, as he was one of the nine players held out due to fear of potential exposure to COVID-19.</p>
<p>“It was a tough week to go through. It’s never fun to be isolated. But with the COVID thing, it’s part of it. You’ve just got to respect that,” Poulin said, adding, “For sure, it’s fun to get to be with the team and get some experience.”</p>
<p>Barring disaster, it looks unlikely Poulin will suit up for the Penguins in the playoffs, if they even bring him up to the hub city of Toronto at all. They bolstered their depth up front at the trade deadline. On their current camp roster, there are 16 forwards who suited up for the Penguins at the NHL level this season.</p>
<p>“If they need me, I’ll be ready for it,” he said.</p>
<p>At the very least, Poulin will get a real shot at making the NHL roster this fall.</p>
<p><strong>The down low on P.O.</strong></p>
<p>Pierre-Olivier Joseph, another of Pittsburgh’s better prospects, was invited to this postseason camp, too, after the skinny 21-year-old in his first pro season emerged as a top defenseman for Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League.</p>
<p>“It was great to receive the call,” he said. “I was laying on my couch and watching movies and stuff the last couple of months. It was good to get the news.”</p>
<p>Joseph was also among the players held out at the start of camp due to the COVID-19 scare. Practicing now, he hopes to make the most of his experience alongside “the older guys,” however long it lasts, and will try to “not get in their way.”</p>
<p>The Penguins are excited about his future. Mike Vellucci, their AHL coach and GM, recently told the Post-Gazette he thought Joseph was “outstanding” in 2019-20 and predicted he’d be a top-four blue-liner in the NHL one day.</p>
<p>The 2017 first-round draft pick had three goals, 17 points and a plus-2 rating in 52 games playing for Vellucci, the first-year Wilkes-Barre/Scranton boss.</p>
<p>“The way he pushed me, he gave me so much confidence,” he said of Vellucci.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome home, Casey</strong></p>
<p>Casey DeSmith is one of five goalies currently in camp with the Penguins. After spending the regular season with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, he’s thrilled to be back, reunited with his wife in the house the newlyweds bought last summer.</p>
<p>“It’s nice. I definitely enjoy being back in Pittsburgh,” he said. “It’s kind of a treat to be able to come home and stay in the house after a long time in a hotel this year. Obviously, I’m really enjoying spending time with all the guys.”</p>
<p>As the third goalie on the depth chart, he is an injury or illness to Matt Murray or Tristan Jarry away from being in a Pittsburgh uniform again. DeSmith vowed to be ready despite getting limited practice time with NHLers so far in camp.</p>
<p>“Obviously, this is a crazy climate we’re in and crazy things are going to happen, either with our team or other teams,” the 28-year-old puck-stopper said. “So I’m just trying to stay ready and help the guys around me get better, too.”</p>
