<h1>Dems pushing for creation of civilian police review boards in Pa. counties</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A bill that would create independent citizen police review boards in nearly all Pennsylvania counties is expected to be introduced by Pennsylvania Democrats.</p>
<p>Rep. Austin Davis, D-McKeesport, will introduce legislation this week that would establish an independent review board in all second- through eighth-class counties — every county except Philadelphia — that would examine complaints of police misconduct, conduct public hearings, subpoena witnesses, and provide findings and recommendations to a municipality’s governing body.</p>
<p>“What’s been clear over the last couple of weeks and months is that the public wants more transparency as it relates to police officers and accountability,” Mr. Davis said. “And I think this is a measure that will quite frankly help build trust between law enforcement and members of the public.”</p>
<p>Police misconduct has been under a microscope in the U.S. after several incidents of police brutality against Black citizens.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis’ bill has 16 Democratic co-sponsors and is a companion to a similar bill being introduced by Sen. Wayne Fontana, D-Brookline.</p>
<p>Mr. Fontana, who circulated a co-sponsorship memo for the legislation in June, said it has yet to be assigned to a committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Fontana introduced a similar bill last year that never received a vote.</p>
<p>Both chambers of Pennsylvania’s Legislature are Republican controlled.</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s legislative arm is again considering the adoption of its own countywide citizen police review board.</p>
<p>County Council’s public safety committee will discuss the measure Thursday. Beth Pittinger, executive director of Pittsburgh’s Citizen Police Review Board, is scheduled to speak.</p>
<p>The bill <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/02/04/County-Council-to-again-consider-independent-police-review-board/stories/202002040145" target="_blank">has been in committee since February</a>.</p>
