<h1>Pirates 'sick' about losing Anthony Alford to injury</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Since outfielder Anthony Alford joined the Pirates, there has been no shortage of optimism surrounding what he might be able to accomplish given an actual opportunity for playing time.</p>
<p>That experiment was cut short Saturday, as Alford fractured his right elbow while jumping into the center-field wall in pursuit of a Tucker Barnhart home run in the third inning of a 6-2 loss to the Reds at PNC Park.</p>
<p>While nothing is official, it's almost certain that Alford's season is finished.</p>
<p>Immediately after Barnhart's home run landed, Alford grabbed his elbow and slowly walked to the Pirates dugout in pain.</p>
<p>"Honestly, it makes me a little sick to my stomach," manager Derek Shelton said. "Just knowing the opportunity that he has right now, then even more so knowing the person and the kid. Just to see the pain and anguish in his eyes, it’s difficult. It’s something that we have to move through. But I definitely feel for him."</p>
<p>Alford homered Wednesday and smacked a triple in Game 2 of Friday’s doubleheader while also displaying some serious speed in darting home to score on a wild pitch. It looked as though the Pirates might've actually found something, a bright spot in this lost season.</p>
<p>In four games, Alford hit .250 (3-for-12) with a home run, a triple and four RBIs.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know he hurt his elbow that bad until after the game when we found out the news," Williams said. "He was playing really well for us, and I was excited to see him in center field [Saturday] for the start. I’m hoping that he’s going to be healthy for spring training. It sounded like he would be. I’m excited to see what he can bring and add to our team in spring training.”</p>
<p>The Pirates have not yet announced who will replace Alford on the 28-man roster. That move is likely to come Sunday morning.</p>
<p>It's been that kind of season for the Pirates, who have lost a heap of pitchers plus catcher Luke Maile and utility man Phillip Evans to season-ending injuries.</p>
<p>Alford was a special case, as the Pirates claimed him off waivers from the Blue Jays. Given his raw ability and his history with Shelton and general manager Ben Cherington, it looked like Alford might wind up to be a tremendous addition, a future piece.</p>
<p>Now, it has turned into one more dose of bad news for the Pirates, another player lost.</p>
<p>“It’s one of those things where you just kind of have to put your head down and step up for guys that aren’t there," Williams said. "It’s a tremendous opportunity for certain guys to be the next man up, to perform at that level. We’ve seen it with the starting pitchers we’ve brought up. We’ve seen it with the relievers and guys who have fallen into their roles now as relievers, and they’re running with it.</p>
<p>"I’m proud of the guys who have stepped up as the next man up. It’s one of those things, man. Injuries happen. You just hope they don’t happen as often as they are this season.”</p>
