<h1>Seven sworn in Thursday as City of Pittsburgh paramedics </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Fearless” would describe the seven paramedics sworn in Thursday morning at the Fallen Officers Memorial on the North Shore.</p>
<p>Despite the lingering threat of the Covid-19 pandemic, several of the newly-minted paramedics said they didn’t fear the coronavirus and were ready to do their jobs serving the city.</p>
<p>“That’s what I signed up for,” said Zachary Saylor, of Shadyside. He is originally from Asbury, N.J., and started as a firefighter for the Franklin Township Fire Department in New Jersey at age 17.</p>
<p>Mr. Saylor graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in emergency medicine and will serve as a “roving” paramedic in the city until he is assigned to a specific medical station.</p>
<p>“We’re going to help the people the best we can,” he said.</p>
<p>His fellow graduate, Emon Ismael, originally of Toms River, N.J., noted that the medical world is always changing and paramedics like him have to be ready to adapt.</p>
<p>“This is the job I signed up for,” Mr. Ismael said. “There’s going to be an ever-revolving door of ‘what’s next’ in medicine.”</p>
<p>Also sworn in Wednesday were Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Lederman, Emily Migdal, Nissa Thomsen and Joseph Mahoney. Mr. Mahoney previously served as an EMT for the city and was promoted to a paramedic. They all swore the oath to the city at 11:14 a.m.</p>
<p>“It’s much easier to promote a paramedic from an EMT because they already know the system,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich.</p>
<p>Dr. Ronald Roth, medical director of the City of Pittsburgh EMS, offered words of confidence, encouragement and caution for the newly-minted paramedics in a brief speech.</p>
<p>“This is a unique time,” Dr. Roth said. “We are in the midst of two plagues - an acute plague and a plague that has been around for hundreds of years,” referring to recent civil unrest and the demand for equal rights.</p>
<p>“I hope you will accept this challenge,” he said.</p>
<p>The ceremony is normally held in the Pittsburgh City Council chambers, but due to the need to social distance the swearing-in was held outdoors at the North Shore.</p>
