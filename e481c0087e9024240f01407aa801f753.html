<h1>Prosecutors seeking less prison time for man accused of being 2nd shooter in federal witness murder</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Because of a shaky witness, the federal government has changed its mind about trying to put a Manchester man behind bars for 15 years in the murder of a federal witness and is now arguing for a reduced nine-year sentence.</p>
<p>Glenn Thomas is set to be sentenced next month as an accessory after the fact in the 2014 killing of drug courier <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2014/08/23/Daughter-killed-mother-shot-in-Hill-District/stories/201408230075" target="_blank">Tina Crawford</a> as she was about to leave for the U.S. attorney's office to talk about a heroin ring run by Price Montgomery.</p>
<p>Montgomery, of Mt. Washington, was convicted of killing her to keep her quiet.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors have long said they believe Thomas was the second shooter, but he was never charged with murder. Instead, he was indicted and pleaded guilty to being an accessory in ditching the getaway vehicle in Virginia.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office had intended to introduce evidence at sentencing to show that Thomas was the second killer in arguing for an enhanced sentence, 15 years, under the accessory statute.</p>
<p>Thomas's lawyer, Lee Rothman, objected, saying allowing prosecutors to attempt such a "back door" mini-trial at a sentencing hearing, where the standard of proof is lower than at a regular trial, is a violation of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Mr. Rothman appears to have won a partial victory.</p>
<p>In recent court filings, assistant U.S. attorneys Shaun Sweeney and Heidi Grogan indicated to U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak that the government is no longer seeking an upward variance for the 15-year prison term.</p>
<p>Instead, they said 108 months will be enough.</p>
<p>The reason is the questionable testimony of a witness who was indicted in 2016 under seal for heroin dealing who said he was with Montgomery and Thomas on the day of the shooting and heard them talking about having to "handle" her cooperation.</p>
<p>After the killings, prosecutors indicated, he said Thomas came to his house in an agitated state and told him he and Montgomery had shot Ms. Crawford and her mother. He also said Thomas had told him that Montgomery had dropped his cell phone at the scene, which became the critical piece of evidence in the case when investigators found Montgomery's DNA on it.</p>
<p>The witness appeared in federal court for an evidentiary hearing in December so that Judge Hornak could hear his story and Mr. Rothman could cross-examine him.</p>
<p>It didn't go well for the government.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is not naming the witness because of the threat to his well-being.</p>
<p>Mr. Rothman said in court papers that the witness' testimony was "too inherently unreliable and contradictory to prove, even by a preponderance of the evidence, that Mr. Thomas was the second shooter and, consequently, to justify the significant enhancement of Mr. Thomasâ€™s sentence sought by the government."</p>
<p>The government said essentially the same.</p>
<p>"At the outset, the government concedes that [the witness] was not a strong witness for the government at the hearing on December 9, 2019," the prosecutors wrote earlier this month. "He was at times agitated and argumentative, and it was obvious that he did not want to testify against his friend, [Thomas]."</p>
<p>The prosecutors said that the witness repeated parts of the story he had told previously, but at times was also unresponsive to questions and exhibited an "off-putting demeanor" that was due in part to one of his friends sitting in the gallery and either trying to distract him or intimidate him until a security officer removed the man.</p>
<p>"On cross examination, [the witness] was unable to recall the date on which he had first met with Pittsburgh police after the murder, but [he] admitted that he had lied to them during that first interview by saying he knew nothing about the murder," the prosecutors said. "He also admitted on cross examination that he later changed his story regarding his knowledge, but did so only after he was charged with possessing and intending to distribute 134 bricks of heroin. He thereafter entered into a plea agreement, and he is hoping to receive a break on his sentence in exchange for his cooperation against the defendant and Montgomery. While [his] testimony should therefore be considered with great caution by the court, at the same time it is clear that his testimony has been largely corroborated by the other evidence of record."</p>
<p>Mr. Sweeney and Ms. Grogan said it's still their position that the witness' testimony in conjunction with all the other facts is enough to show that Thomas was the second shooter under the "preponderance of the evidence" standard. But, they said, the evidence "only barely" reaches that standard.</p>
<p>"Therefore," they said, "the government is hereby withdrawing its request for an upward variance based on [the witness's] testimony."</p>
<p>Judge Hornak said he will sentence Thomas on March 23.</p>
