<h1>Mattress Factory revokes fiber artist's residency after incident at party</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Olek, a prolific fiber artist with an international reputation, came to Pittsburgh last month to create art for a spring show at the Mattress Factory, a contemporary art museum on the North Side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After an incident Saturday night during a private party in the museum’s lobby, Mattress Factory leaders revoked its residency invitation to Olek, whose full name is Agata Oleksiak.</p>
<p>The artist, who was born in Poland and now lives there, came into contact with a guest&nbsp;at Imbibe Pittsburgh, a beer- and wine-tasting event that rented the museum space.</p>
<p>A uniformed Pittsburgh police officer, one of several hired for the event, handed Olek a citation for harassment, noting that the man was bleeding.&nbsp;The male guest, whose name does not appear on the citation, accused Olek of head-butting him.</p>
<p>In a lengthy interview Thursday with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Olek, 41, gave her version of what happened at the party attended by about 300 people. She was wearing virtual reality goggles to create performance art, she said, noting that she uses goggles&nbsp;partly because they do not produce any waste, only a computer file.</p>
<p>The artist, who lived for at least 15 years in Brooklyn, N.Y., said she was holding plastic&nbsp;controllers, one in each hand, to manipulate a palette of colors while “crocheting” in mid-air.&nbsp;The incident happened around 8:45 p.m., shortly before the event was to end at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Noting that the goggles obscured her vision, Olek said she circled around a woman near the stage where a band played.Then, she said, a man pushed her forcefully from behind and swore at her. The artist said she jerked her head upward and that the goggles on her head cut the man’s lip, drawing blood.</p>
<p>“I was crocheting around his wife. I didn’t see him. I don’t feel great about it,” she said, adding that it was an accident, not intentional.</p>
<p>The police officer told her, “‘I have a guy with a bloody lip. I have to give you a citation,’” according to the artist.</p>
<p>Mandy Wilson, a spokeswoman for the Mattress Factory, said the man did not appear to be seriously injured. “I don’t believe he sought medical treatment. I’m not aware of him contacting us.”</p>
<p>Olek said neither police nor the museum’s leaders were interested in hearing her version of events. She showed the harassment citation to the Post-Gazette. It indicated a $40 “processing fee” but did not mention a fine. There was no legible description of the incident on the citation and Pittsburgh police did not provide details.</p>
<p>In a letter dated Wednesday, Hayley Haldeman, the Mattress Factory’s interim executive director, cited the incident as one of three reasons for revoking the artist’s residency at the museum.</p>
<p>The letter, obtained by the Post-Gazette, says Olek was also verbally abusive to two female museum employees, calling them “bitches,”&nbsp;“idiots” and asking them if they could do anything right.</p>
<p>The letter also said Olek made inappropriate comments to museum staff, stating that American women&nbsp;“lie so much” about sexual assault, make rape claims&nbsp;“to use for their own benefit,” and that it&nbsp;“does not count” as rape if a victim does not press criminal charges.</p>
<p>Mattress Factory leaders and board members spent much of 2018 handling allegations by four female employees that a male exhibitions installer harassed them at work. Two women claimed the male co-worker raped them in their living quarters but did not file police reports. The man left the museum’s employ in the spring of 2018.</p>
<p>In September 2018, the four women filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming they suffered retaliation by museum managers for complaining about their co-worker. Within days of the NLRB complaint, Michael Olijnyk was no longer&nbsp;the museum’s director. He still lives&nbsp;in a condominium on the top floor, but does not receive a salary from the museum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Olek said that Ms. Haldeman and the museum’s board president, Dr. Michael White, arrived at the Mattress Factory on Saturday night after the incident. She said they told her her residency was revoked and that she must move out of the&nbsp;museum-owned apartment on North Taylor Street where she had been living. Olek said she moved out of the apartment on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ms. Wilson, the museum spokeswoman, said the decision was not made lightly.&nbsp;“The museum has to protect the staff and the public,” she said.</p>
<p>The fiber artist was one of eight people, chosen out of 360 applicants, to exhibit at the Mattress Factory in “Factory Installed 2020,” a show slated to open May 29.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the feast of St. Agatha, Olek appeared in Market Square, Downtown, with a fiber art piece honoring the patron saint of&nbsp;breast cancer patients, rape victims and wet nurses. She noted that her birth name is Agatha.</p>
<p>In 2011, after an altercation with a man in a bar in London, Olek was charged with unlawful wounding and unlawful wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.&nbsp;After five days in a London jail, she was placed on house arrest and wore an ankle monitor.&nbsp;A year later, in Southwark Crown Court, she was found not guilty of unlawful wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and guilty of unlawful wounding. She was sentenced to home curfew.</p>
<p>Olek has exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Venice Biennale. In 2010, she crocheted a colorful covering for Lower Manhattan’s famed Wall Street bull sculpture.</p>
