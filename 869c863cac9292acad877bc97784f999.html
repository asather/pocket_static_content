<h1>Allegheny County Council anti-discrimination, no-knock warrant bills head to committee</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County Council on Tuesday sent several bills to committee, including one to ensure nondiscrimination in medical care and the other aiming to ban no-knock search warrants.</p>
<p>Councilman Paul Klein, D-Shadyside, introduced the measure to ban any discrimination against any of the county’s protected classes in a medical care setting. Those protected classes include:&nbsp;race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, familial status, age or because of use of a guide or support animal.</p>
<p>Mr. Klein cited the Trump administration’s June 12 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/politics/trump-transgender-rights.html" target="_blank">reversal of health care protections for trans individuals</a> in hospitals, doctor’s offices and in dealing with insurance companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is yet another rule or regulation put forward by this administration that defines sex discrimination as only applying when someone faces discrimination for being male or female,” Mr. Klein said before being abruptly cut off by Councilman Bob Macey, D-West Mifflin and council vice president who chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Klein’s bill was sent to the Committee of Government Reform. Several members signed on as co-sponsors.</p>
<p>Two bills sponsored by Councilwoman Bethany Hallam, D-at large, and Olivia Bennett, D-Northview Heights, headed to the Public Safety Committee — one of those bills for the second time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A bill to ban&nbsp;“no-knock” search warrants — warrants that allow police to enter without warning —&nbsp;among county police and sheriffs was sent to the Public Safety Committee, chaired by Ms. Bennett.&nbsp;The legislation aims to penalize any county officer or deputy sheriff who doesn’t follow established procedure to&nbsp;“knock and announce” when serving a search warrant with a summary offense, and a fine of not more than $300 and/or 30 days in prison.</p>
<p>The bill comes on the heels of increased protest and scrutiny of policing and race, and particularly a heightened awareness of&nbsp;“no-knock” warrants after police in Louisville, Ky., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html" target="_blank">entered the apartment of Breonna Taylor, 26, on a search warrant without warning and shot her eight times, killing her</a>.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County police and the administration declined to comment on the&nbsp;“no-knock” warrant proposal, as the administration does not comment on legislation before it reaches committee, according to Amie Downs, county spokeswoman.</p>
<p>As a matter of policy, county police follow existing case law and the Commonwealth’s Rules of Criminal Procedure when serving search warrants.</p>
<p>A bill to require universal testing at Kane Regional Centers and the Allegheny County Jail returned to the Public Safety Committee, where last week it <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/06/17/Allegheny-County-Council-committee-jail-Kane-COVID-19-testing-Bethany-Hallam/stories/202006170169" target="_blank">received a negative recommendation</a>. Ms. Hallam amended the bill to now include all county employees.</p>
<p>A symbolic motion <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/06/23/pittsburgh-allegheny-county-port-authority-fares-low-income-emergency-covid-19/stories/202006230093" target="_blank">urging reduced fares on Port Authority transit for low-income riders during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> passed council with nine members voting in favor. Members Tom Baker, R-Ross, DeWitt Walton, D-Hill District, abstained. Members Sam DeMarco, R-at large, Cindy Kirk, R-McCandless, and&nbsp; Mr. Macey voted no. Council President Pat Catena was absent.</p>
