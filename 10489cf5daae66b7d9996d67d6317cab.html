<h1>Recent major trade acquisitions had quiet debuts with Penguins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Jason Zucker will soon join a growing list of major trade acquisitions who’ve skated into town to meet high expectations for the Penguins. Here’s a look at how some of his predecessors fared in their first games in black and gold:</em></p>
<p><strong>Marian Hossa, Feb. 28, 2008 —</strong> He’s most remembered now for spurning the Penguins in free agency the following summer, opting to join the Detroit Red Wings instead because he believed they had a better chance to win the Stanley Cup in 2009. We all know how that worked out. Before all of that drama, though, he was the first truly high-profile trade acquisition to join the core of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. The excitement for the deal that brought him here was palpable, even though the Penguins had to give up a lot to get him; familiar faces Colby Armstrong and Erik Christiansen, top prospect Angelo Esposito and a first-round draft pick were sent away. The debut itself didn’t quite live up to the hype, though. Hossa played barely more than 10 minutes and recorded only a single shot on goal in a 5-1 loss at Boston. He went on to score 12 playoff goals before the Penguins bowed to his future team in six games in the Stanley Cup final.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jarome Iginla, March 30, 2013 —</strong> General manager Ray Shero went all in on the long-time Calgary Flames star, sending away two prospects and a first-round pick despite Iginla’s pending free agency. The deal is mostly remembered as a bust, as he ended up scoring just four playoff goals while the Penguins were swept out of the Eastern Conference final by Boston a couple of months later. And his highly anticipated debut foreshadowed that disappointment. Iginla played 17:30 but registered just three shots in a 2-0 home win against the Islanders. His first goal came three days later at home against Buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>Patric Hornqvist, Oct. 9, 2014 —</strong> Penguins fans were probably more excited to get rid of the enigmatic James Neal than they were to add the Nashville winger in the trade that brought him to Pittsburgh during the preceding offseason. Still, there was hope that he could become a reliable top-six winger to pair with one of the team’s talented centers, and unlike predecessors on this list, he made an immediate impact, recording a goal and an assist in the season opener against Anaheim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He’s been a staple in the lineup ever since, and his winning goal in Game 6 of the 2017 Cup final against Nashville will go down as one of the most clutch in franchise history.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phil Kessel, Oct. 8, 2015 —</strong> Not since Hossa had the Penguins acquired a finisher of Kessel’s caliber, so fans were giddy when news came over the summer that general manager Jim Rutherford had acquired him from Toronto for a small mint: center Nick Spaling, defenseman Scott Harrington, forward Kasperi Kapanen and two draft picks. We know what came next. Two Stanley Cups. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2017/08/14/phil-kessel-hot-dog-stanley-cup-tracker/stories/201708140127" target="_blank">Roasts of Toronto sportswriters</a> who’d accused him of eating too many hot dogs. That <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/07/24/phil-kessel-house-sale-realtor-price-photos-pittsburgh-penguins/stories/201907240109" target="_blank">weird one-seat home theater</a> at his Marshall home. Incalculable Twitter memes. The debut, though? Again, pretty forgettable. Kessel was more active than Hossa and Iginla, generating six shots, but he couldn’t break through in a 3-0 loss against Dallas to open the season. His first goal came in Game 2, another loss at Arizona.</p>

<p><strong>Derick Brassard, Feb. 27, 2018 —</strong> Rutherford pulled every string to bring him here to anchor the Penguins third line. The complicated deal involved two other teams, NHL regulars Ryan Reaves and Ian Cole, top goalie prospect&nbsp;Filip Gustavsson, two draft picks and some creative salary cap math. The result was more simple: underachievement, again foreshadowed by a quiet debut. Brassard generated just two shots in a 3-2 home loss against New Jersey. And by season’s end, he’d scored just four times total and once in the playoff run that ended with a six-game defeat against eventual Stanley Cup champ Washington in the conference semifinals. Brassard was flipped at the deadline a year later, ending his Penguins tenure with just 12 goals in 54 regular season games.&nbsp;</p>
