<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh annual gala has morphed with the times, and in 2020 includes deliveries for ticket buyers as well as for families with food insecurities, along with a celebrity-packed virtual program that is free to the public.</p>
<p>Produced by Erich Bergen and his company, 6W Entertainment, the Great Night In Family Gala on June 14 will feature appearances by Steelers legend Franco Harris and the Pirates’ Josh Bell, and from the world of entertainment, Dormont native Zachary Quinto (“Star Trek’s” cinematic Spock among screen and Broadway roles); fellow Carnegie Mellon University alum and Tony Award-winner Patina Miller (“Pippin”; “Sister Act”); and Katherine McPhee, American Idol runner-up and star of TV’s “Smash” and “Waitress” on Broadway.</p>
<p>After a half-hour “premiere” auction at 6 p.m. Sunday, the hour-long virtual program from 6:30-7:30 p.m. will celebrate the arts’ ability to get to the heart of issues facing Pittsburgh and the rest of the world today. The all-ages gala will be hosted by Seneca Valley High and Point Park University’s Conner John Gillooly, a star of Broadway’s “School of Rock.”</p>
<p>Other celebrities making appearances include Corey Cott, the lead who was cast as the lead of Broadway’s “Disney’s Newsies” right out of CMU and currently can be seen on FOX TV’s “Filthy Rich,” local singer Jackie Evancho, songwriter-producer Desmond Child and Montgomery Lamb, who currently stars as Katie, the bass player in Broadway’s “School of Rock.”</p>
<p>Joining them will be Mo Willems, a six-time Emmy Award winner as a writer and animator on “Sesame Street” and a New York Times best-selling author, and French performer, illustrator and children's author Herve Tullet, who will showcase his talent — and help you with yours — for doodling.</p>
<p>Along with Bell and Harris, sports figures include a previous gala host, KDKA’s Bob Pompeani, and Point Park alum and Pirates coach Don Kelly.</p>
<p>The in-person 2020 Children’s Museum gala was initially to take place on June 6, but that day was given over instead to deliveries to 300 families with food insecurities, through partnerships with Providence Connections Family Support Center and Manchester Academic Charter Middle School and underwritten by PNC Bank.</p>
<p>Those families received the same meal boxes for four that 120 ticket-buyers and sponsors will receive Sunday, plus a bottle of Engine House 25 wine, prepared by North Side businesses: a meatballs and spaghetti dinner from Legends Eatery, bread from BreadWorks and cookies from Priory Fine Pastries.</p>
<p>All proceeds support the Children’s Museum and MuseumLab, neighborhood businesses and families in the North Side experiencing food insecurity.&nbsp;For the auction and other details visit <a href="https://pittsburghkids.org/support/great-night-gala-2020" target="_blank">www.greatnightgala.org</a>&nbsp;</p>
