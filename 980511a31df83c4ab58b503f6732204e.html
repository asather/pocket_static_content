<h1>AT&amp;T SportsNet creates overflow channel to broadcast Penguins, Pirates simultaneously</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Local sports fans will soon have the option to watch the Penguins and Pirates on the same network, at the same time. Sort of.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T SportsNet <a href="https://pittsburgh-attsn.att.com/att-sportsnet-to-expand-its-coverage-with-new-alternate-channel/" target="_blank">announced Thursday</a> that it’s creating an overflow channel to accommodate scheduling conflicts between the two teams with baseball back from its COVID-19 pandemic break and the NHL poised to follow this weekend.</p>
<p>Previously, scheduling conflicts were often resolved with Penguins playoff games taking priority on AT&amp;T SportsNet and the Pirates relying on MLB Network to get their games on local television.</p>
<p>Now, fans can move over to what AT&amp;T is calling “PIT2” to watch the Pirates while the Penguins are playing on the flagship channel.</p>
<p>PIT2 will air Pirates games at least twice in the coming weeks, as the Penguins’ qualifying round series with Montreal includes at least two games that conflict with the Pirates’ schedule Aug. 3 and 5.</p>
<p>Necessary extra games in the Montreal series or a subsequent playoff series could create more conflicts, which would result in more Pirates games being moved to PIT2.</p>
<p>Each game broadcast will be accompanied by pre- and postgame shows.</p>
