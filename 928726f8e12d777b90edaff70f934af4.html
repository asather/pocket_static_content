<p>ATLANTA — A Georgia district attorney said Tuesday that a grand jury should decide whether to bring charges in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/us/ahmed-arbery-shooting-georgia.html" rel="nofollow">the killing of Ahmaud Arbery</a>, a 25-year-old unarmed black man who was chased by two white men and shot in southern Georgia in February.</p>
<p>“After careful review of the evidence,” the prosecutor, Tom Durden, of Georgia’s Atlantic Judicial Circuit, wrote in a statement, “I am of the opinion that the case should be presented to the grand jury of Glynn County for consideration of criminal charges.”</p>
<p>Arbery was killed after the men pursued him while he was running in the Satilla Shores neighborhood just outside of Brunswick, in Glynn County. Neither man was arrested after the slaying, which occurred on Feb. 23 at about 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Arbery’s family and friends said he was an avid jogger, and they do not believe he committed a crime before being chased.</p>
<p>Anger over the case has been building among civil rights activists and others, with the Rev. Al Sharpton and state and local NAACP leaders calling for an investigation.</p>
<p>Durden said in a statement Tuesday that the case should go before a Glynn County grand jury once the state judicial system allows such bodies to be empaneled again. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Georgia Supreme Court has prohibited grand juries from meeting through June 12.</p>
<p>Durden is the third prosecutor to be assigned to the case after the other two recused themselves because of professional ties to Gregory McMichael, one of the men who pursued Arbery.</p>
<p>McMichael had recently retired after a long career as an investigator in the Brunswick District Attorney’s office. He had also served seven years as an officer in the Glynn County Police Department.</p>
<p>One of the prosecutors who was previously assigned to the case, George Barnhill of the Waycross Judicial District, had advised police that there was insufficient probable cause to arrest Arbery’s pursuers, arguing that they had acted legally under the state’s citizen arrest and self-defense statutes, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.</p>
<p>Barnhill eventually asked to be removed from the case because his son worked in the Waycross prosecutor’s office with McMichael.</p>
<p>According to a police report, McMichael, 64, said he saw Arbery running through his neighborhood and thought that he looked like the suspect in a rash of nearby break-ins. McMichael and his son Travis, 34, armed themselves and began chasing him in a truck.</p>
<p>A confrontation between Arbery and Travis McMichael, who was carrying a shotgun, eventually ensued, and Arbery was shot at least twice.</p>
<p>A graphic video surfaced online Tuesday that appeared to show the shooting. In a letter to the police department, Barnhill described a video made by a third man who had joined the McMichaels in “hot pursuit” of Arbery.</p>
