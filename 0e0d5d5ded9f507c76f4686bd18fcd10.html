<h1>Pa. charter school coalition leader departs after 'insensitive' Facebook post about protests</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Coalition of Public Charter Schools has parted ways with its executive director after she posted what she later called&nbsp;“insensitive” comments on Facebook about protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death in police custody.</p>
<p>The coalition announced Ana Meyers’ “departure” on Monday. It was unclear if she resigned or was fired.</p>
<p>“This is a personnel matter, and I must refer you to the board’s statement,” said Sean Connolly, a public relations professional hired by the coalition.</p>
<p>The original Facebook post and a subsequent apology were first reported by WHYY, Philadelphia’s NPR station.</p>
<p>Ms. Meyers, who led the coalition for three years, posted the comments May 30 on her personal Facebook page in reaction to protests in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>“This is not okay, friends. None of this is okay,” she wrote. “Not the murder of an innocent person no matter the color of his skin. Not the looting. Not the attacks on police. ...</p>
<p>“Every sector has bad apples... let’s not forget, including the church,” she continued. “We cannot generalize and make it seem like every police officer is bad. I guarantee that if your house is robbed you will be calling the police to protect you. Think about THAT. These protesters disgust me. All lives matter!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Meyers noted her husband was a retired state police trooper and said she knows many state troopers and “they are all good people who lay their lives on the line of duty daily to keep us safe.”</p>
<p>On Friday, Ms. Meyers wrote an apology that said in part “I posted on my personal Facebook page remarks that were insensitive and inappropriate. I am sorry. As the wife of a retired state trooper, my instinct was to defend the many good and honorable law enforcement officers in Pennsylvania, pointing out that the horrific death of George Floyd should not reflect on all of them.”</p>
<p>She also said she&nbsp;“failed to acknowledge the pain, anger and grief of the good and honorable people who were protesting his death and seeking rightful justice.”</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Coalition of Public Charter Schools said new leadership was in the&nbsp;“best interests” of its schools and families, and it would begin to search for a replacement for Ms. Meyers.&nbsp;</p>
