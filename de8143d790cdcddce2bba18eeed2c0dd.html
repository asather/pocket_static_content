<p>The Army Corps of Engineers announced Wednesday that it has closed several public facilities in its Pittsburgh District until further notice in “the interest of public safety and the well-being of our staff” amid the novel coronavirus’ pandemic.</p>
<p>“We have been actively monitoring the effect of COVID-19 on services we provide and it has become apparent that it is in the best interest of the public and our staff to take these measures,” said Lt. Col. Jonathan Klink, the Pittsburgh District’s commander.</p>
<p>Some of the facilities that are now closed are at <a href="https://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/Lakes/Loyalhanna-Lake/" target="_blank">Loyalhanna Lake</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/Lakes/Conemaugh-River-Lake/" target="_blank">Conemaugh River Lake</a> near Saltsburg, Indiana County;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/Lakes/Crooked-Creek-Lake/" target="_blank">Crooked Creek Lake</a> near Ford City, Armstrong County; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/missions/recreation/lakes/mahoning-creek-lake/" target="_blank">Mahoning Creek Lake</a> near&nbsp;New Bethlehem in Clarion County.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the temporary closures — which were effective as of 5 p.m. Wednesday — boat ramps will remain open.</p>
<p>“Throughout this situation, the district has three priorities; protecting our people, maintaining mission readiness, and supporting the whole-of-government effort,” said Col. Klink. “We will continue to assess and monitor the effect of COVID-19 and adjust as needed.”</p>
<p>The Corps' closures were announced on the same day that the Army Medical Command announced its coronavirus hot-line: 1-800-984-8523.</p>
