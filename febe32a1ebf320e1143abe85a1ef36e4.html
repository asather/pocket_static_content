<h1>Trey McGowens, Jeff Capel's first verbal commitment at Pitt, enters transfer portal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An offseason that was expected to come with some level of roster turnover for Pitt has claimed its first high-profile name.</p>
<p>Sophomore guard Trey McGowens, who had started in 63 of his 66 career games with the program, has entered the transfer portal, depriving coach Jeff Capel and the Panthers of a player who was very recently viewed as one of the program’s foundational pieces.</p>
<p>Last season, McGowens averaged 11.5 points, 3.6 assists and a team-high 1.9 steals per game. He ranked third on the team in scoring and second in assists, showing improved ability as a ball-handler and distributor.</p>
<p>“Trey was a productive player in our program for the past two seasons,” Capel said in a statement. “We appreciate his commitment to the program and his teammates and wish him the best of luck as he seeks an opportunity elsewhere.”</p>
<p>It’s a sudden, although not entirely surprising, end to a career at the school that had once appeared so promising. A South Carolina native and a former top-100 prospect, McGowens was Capel’s first commitment, giving a verbal pledge to the program in April 2018 and signing with it without having visited campus. In the process, he became the Panthers’ highest-rated recruit since Steven Adams.</p>
<p>“Our family is extremely appreciative of coach Capel and the Pittsburgh family,” said Bobby McGowens, Trey’s father. “Trey committed to Pittsburgh to develop as a point guard and things just didn’t work out. His goal for his next college is to play point guard more on a full-time basis.”</p>
<p>As a freshman, he largely lived up to his lofty billing. He averaged 11.6 points per game, ranking him third on the team. It wasn’t so much his average that stood out, though — it was his explosiveness. A gifted athlete, McGowens became the first freshman in Pitt history to score 30 points in a game when he poured in 33 points in a January 2019 victory against Louisville. Five days later, he scored 30 points in a win against Florida State, doing something twice in the span of a single week that previously hadn’t been done in the more than 110 years of Pitt basketball.</p>
<p>With him and fellow freshman Xavier Johnson, the Panthers had not only a backcourt of the future, but potential faces of a seemingly ascendant program.</p>
<p>Though McGowens didn’t regress as a sophomore, he didn’t live up to some of the expectations his freshman success created. His shooting didn’t improve, going from 41.7% overall in 2018-19 to 36.7% in 2019-20. He was unable to get to the free-throw line at the same high rate, which limited his offensive game. His play-making ability that dazzled at times as a freshman too often led him to recklessness as a sophomore, putting him in situations in which he took ill-advised shots or tried to make passes that simply weren’t there. For the second consecutive season, his production fell off as the season progressed. After scoring in double figures in 18 of Pitt’s first 24 games, he did so in only two of its final nine.</p>
<p>What seemed like an intriguing tandem with Johnson soon became an illogical and redundant one, with two athletic slashers who struggled with their 3-point shots in a sport that was becoming increasingly perimeter based.</p>
<p>“I felt like this summer, we worked as hard as we had ever worked before,” McGowens said after Pitt’s March 11 loss to N.C. State in the second round of the ACC tournament. “It was a big disappointment from the standpoint of the team and where we felt like we could have been. But it was another step as far as the program. We just [have] to work on taking leaps.”</p>
<p>Including Kene Chukwuka and Samson George, who took part in the team’s senior night in February despite having remaining eligibility, McGowens becomes the fourth Pitt player and second guard to transfer this offseason. Guard Ryan Murphy did the same last Sunday. He’s also the eighth player to transfer since the start of the 2018-19 season, though many of those individuals were brought to the school by former coach Kevin Stallings and left to pursue better opportunities at smaller programs.</p>
<p>For McGowens, that is unlikely to be the case, as a productive player with two seasons of experience whom Rivals.com ranked as the No. 83 player in his high school class, even after reclassifying, figures to attract the attention of a number of major-conference programs.</p>
<p>McGowens had spoken after the season about “personal agendas” that had doomed Pitt late in the season, when it lost eight of its final nine games. After his decision became public Wednesday, however, a number of his teammates reached out to him on social media to express their support, from Johnson tweeting an emoji of a broken heart and wishing him luck on Instagram to Au’Diese Toney, a fellow sophomore who wished him luck and added he would “see you at the top.”</p>
<p>With the departure of McGowens, Capel now has two open scholarships with which to work.</p>
<p>The off-ball guard spot McGowens leaves behind is expected to be filled by Ithiel Horton, a Delaware transfer about whom Capel and Panthers players raved in the final weeks of the season. Horton’s eligibility next season will give the backcourt some much-needed outside shooting — he made 40.9% of his 3s in his first and only college season — and should help mitigate McGowens’ absence. They also received a commitment Tuesday from Femi Odukale, a rangy and versatile 6-foot-5 guard who could be slotted in a number of different spots on the court.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, McGowens’ exit deprives Pitt of, at the very least, depth at the guard position, something that can’t be discounted for a still-rebuilding program that has seen each of its past two seasons fall apart in the final weeks. More than that, though, it’s the loss of a player who in his best, brightest moments — from the day he committed to his 30-point outbursts — symbolized hope for a program in need of it.</p>
