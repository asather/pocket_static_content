<h1>Pa. shale gas fee revenue projected to drop 21% on low gas prices</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last year’s low natural gas prices are to blame for an expected $53.6 million drop in the amount of impact fees Pennsylvania will collect from shale gas companies this year, the state’s Independent Fiscal Office said.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is projected to raise $198.2 million for the calendar year from fees assessed on wells drawing gas from the state’s Marcellus and Utica shales, the office <a href="http://www.ifo.state.pa.us/Resources/Documents/Impact-Fee-Estimate-2019.pdf" target="_blank">reported on Thursday</a>. Last year, the state collected a record $251.8 million.</p>
<p>The 21% drop in expected fees is being driven by gas prices that averaged $2.63 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 2019 — the lowest level in three years. At that price, gas companies will have to pay $5,000 less for each horizontal well than they did last year.</p>
<p>Impact fees also decrease as wells age, although new wells offset that decline. The 616 wells that were drilled in 2019, which will be subject to the fee for the first time, will each pay $45,700, the fiscal office said. The 7,800 wells that are four years old or older will each pay $15,200.</p>
<p>The slump in fees was not unexpected. Growing gas production has outpaced demand, driving prices lower, with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/08/01/low-natural-gas-prices-futures-drilling-fracking-marcellus-utica-shale-appalachia/stories/201908010047" target="_blank">gas companies, shareholders</a> and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/09/08/Pennsylvania-Marcellus-Utica-Shale-royalty-owners-low-natural-gas-prices/stories/201909080048" target="_blank">royalty owners</a> feeling the squeeze.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/06/27/Shale-gas-impact-fees-raise-252-million-breaking-record-Marcellus-Utica/stories/201906270133" target="_blank">Last year’s record total</a> was also boosted by a court decision in favor of the state that limited which low-producing wells do not have to pay the fees. Companies paid $9 million in overdue fees last year for wells they previously claimed to be exempt.</p>
<p>Impact fees are paid by gas companies in April and distributed in July.</p>
<p>Counties and municipalities that get payments for hosting shale wells will split a smaller pot of money, expected to be $108 million. Impact fee revenue is also allocated to state environmental, infrastructure, emergency management and housing programs.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania has assessed a per-well fee since 2012 on companies that drill for shale gas. It is meant to compensate state and local communities for the industry’s demands on public services and the environment.</p>
<p>Unlike the severance taxes imposed by other gas-drilling states, Pennsylvania’s fee is not tied directly to the volume or value of gas produced by the wells. The fiscal office projects the annual effective tax rate will be 2.1% for the year — the lowest it has been across nine years of collections.</p>
