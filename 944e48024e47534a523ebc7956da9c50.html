<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Chelsea Manning’s legal team said Wednesday that the former intelligence analyst tried to take her own life Wednesday, but was transported to a hospital where she is recovering.</p>
<p>Ms. Manning has been in prison since May 2019 for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks. She was scheduled to appear in federal court in Alexandria, Va., on Friday for a hearing on a motion to terminate the civil contempt sanctions stemming from that refusal.</p>
<p>In the motion filed last month, Ms. Manning’s lawyers argued that Ms. Manning has shown during her incarceration that she can’t be coerced into testifying before a grand jury.</p>
<p>Ms. Manning served seven years in a military prison for leaking a trove of documents to WikiLeaks before President Barack Obama commuted the remainder of her 35-year sentence in 2017.</p>
<p>Alexandria Sheriff Dana Lawhorne said Wednesday: “There was an incident at approximately 12:11 p.m. today at the Alexandria Adult Detention Center involving inmate Chelsea Manning. It was handled appropriately by our professional staff and Ms. Manning is safe.”</p>
<p>Andy Stepanian, a spokesman for Ms. Manning’s legal team, said in a statement Wednesday that Ms. Manning “remains unwavering in her refusal to participate in a secret grand jury process that she sees as highly susceptible to abuse.”</p>
