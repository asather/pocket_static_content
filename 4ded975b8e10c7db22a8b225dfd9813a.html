<h1>Recovery from COVID-19 can take months or longer, local health experts say</h1>

<p>Surviving a serious COVID-19 infection is worth celebrating but those saved by ventilators and long hospital stays likely won’t return home to a normal lifestyle any time soon.</p>
<p>Instead, they can face weeks and even months of recovery time involving various types of rehabilitation, with some potentially facing disability for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>“Approximately half of the patients across the globe with a long ICU stay are not able to return to work even a year later. Many also experience symptoms including chronic fatigue, pain and sleep problems, as well as anxiety and depression,” said Tammy Eaton, a certified registered nurse practitioner who co-founded the Critical Illness Recovery Center at UPMC Mercy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Serious COVID-19 infections don’t only affect lung function but also can damage the heart, kidneys, liver, brain, nerves and muscles, among other impacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virus-induced blood clots can occur bodywide, including the brain, potentially leading to strokes, said Dr. Nitin Bhanot, an Allegheny General Hospital infectious disease specialist.</p>
<p>Recent research shows that small blood clots can affect the skin in the form of rashes.</p>
<p>Kidneys, already sensitive organs, sustain damage that may require the patient to undergo&nbsp;dialysis — a situation generating a potential shortage of services, with Dr. Rachel Levine, state Department of Health secretary, saying her department is reviewing the level of that problem.</p>
<p>Doctors and researchers have only begun addressing and understanding recovery among other questions concerning the health impacts of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If they were on a ventilator, it can take quite a while to recover, depending on age, underlying illnesses and what organs were affected from COVID-19,” Dr. Bhanot said, noting that COVID-19 “can affect the lungs, heart and nervous system.</p>
<p>“So a patient may have a cough and fever, but there also can be involvement of the nerves and muscles,” he said.&nbsp;“Organs can be affected. If a person was on a ventilator, the time to get back to normal can go to months.”</p>
<p>Nerve damage, he said, occurs in the form of neuropathy&nbsp;— a condition that&nbsp;the National Cancer Institute describes as&nbsp;“a&nbsp;nerve problem that causes pain, numbness, tingling, swelling or muscle weakness in different parts of the body. It usually begins in the hands or feet and gets worse over time.”</p>
<p>Diabetes, resulting in poor circulation, and chemotherapy treatment for cancer are common causes of neuropathy.</p>
<p>Dr. Bhanot said some patients with COVID-19 may develop profound weakness, including paralysis.</p>
<p>“The bigger question is, even if the situation gets better now, another wave of infections in the fall is a definite possibility,” he said, noting the need for recovering patients to continue with social distancing, hand washing and other mitigation efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ve had COVID-19 in the U.S. for two months and in China since the end of December,” he said. “The natural history of the disease — the&nbsp;whole spectrum — we’ll see&nbsp;in time to come.”</p>
<p><strong>Calendar needed</strong></p>
<p>An international study published March 23 online in the journal Cell Death &amp; Differentiation found that&nbsp;“a virus-eliminating immune response to SARS-CoV-2 [the virus causing COVID-19] may be difficult to induce at least in some patients and vaccines may not work in these individuals.”</p>
<p>The immune response to tissue damage from COVID-19 “could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in which respiratory failure is characterized by the rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs and subsequent fatality,” it says.</p>
<p>ARDS resulting from an inflammatory response to the virus involves the lungs filling with fluid that can include a clear jell and fluid appearing like ground glass. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vitamin B3 (niacin or nicotinamide) “is highly effective in preventing lung tissue damage,” the journal study states, suggesting that it “might be a wise approach to supply this food supplement to the COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>“Alarmingly,” it adds, “after discharge from hospital, some patients remain [or] return to viral positive and others even relapse.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Brad Butcher, a UPMC critical care specialist and co-founder of the UPMC recovery center, said ARDS from COVID-19 can last longer than what occurs with other causes. It also can include extreme swelling of the vocal cords once a breathing tube is removed — a situation he likened to breathing through a straw and requiring steroid treatment.</p>
<p>He and Ms. Eaton said that COVID-19 impacts are similar in many ways to anyone receiving ICU treatment for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Post-intensive care syndrome or PICS is a well-established condition resulting from long stints under care in an ICU that can lead to physical, psychological, cognitive and social disability, which can affect a person’s quality of life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“To be fair, we haven’t had a lot of coronavirus cases coming through our recovery clinic — patients sick enough to require ventilation are hospitalized for a longer period of time and often require drugs to treat their pain and keep them calm while on the ventilator,” Dr. Butcher said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they do, they will face an uphill battle in restoring strength, endurance and balance, along with overcoming cognitive problems that can affect concentration and attention span. Additional issues include anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD.</p>
<p>What that means is, they may have difficulty carrying out daily routines — bathing and feeding themselves, using the telephone, doing household chores and handling medications, for example.</p>
<p>UPMC Mercy recently had three COVID-19 patients who, at that point, had been on ventilation for 15, 13 and nine days respectively but all three no longer are on respirators and two were being transferred out of intensive care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Likely this population of survivors will have post-intensive care syndrome and a high degree of chronic disability,” he said.</p>
<p>One new powerful way to improve ventilation treatment, he said, is placing patients in prone position&nbsp;— on their stomachs.</p>
<p><strong>Treatments and consequences</strong></p>
<p>For all these reasons, COVID-19 requires new levels of consideration and caution, with impacts not only on patients but their family and loved ones who also face the risk of anxiety, depression and PTSD.</p>
<p>The pandemic forced a shutdown of the UPMC ICU recovery center for four weeks, but Ms. Eaton reopened it recently through telemedicine to support those in recovery from other illness, with anticipation of ever more patients affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Dr. Butcher and Ms. Eaton said keeping patients in isolation, with no visitors allowed, affects their families and loved ones who can become overwhelmed with concern. Phone exchanges with doctors often include tears.</p>
<p>“Imagine sitting at home and wondering what is going on with your loved one,” Dr. Butcher said. “Will they ever get out of the hospital? You can’t touch them. You can’t talk to them. Imagine how difficult that must be.”</p>
<p>The center offers many levels of therapy for physical, cognitive and psychological therapy, among others, to help with patients with memory problems, inability to find things, drive, return to work or even walk a block. The functionality of other patients are even more severe.</p>
<p>Key, they said, is letting patients and family members know that what they are experiencing is typical, with further need to educate outpatient health-care providers that recovery from COVID-19 — or any critical illness —&nbsp;can be a marathon rather than a sprint.</p>
<p>“What people need to know is that there can be long-term consequences to surviving an ICU stay,” Ms. Eaton said.&nbsp;“People need to be educated about this and more healthcare providers, especially those providing care in the outpatient setting, need to be educated on what to look for.</p>
<p>“Long recoveries are expected and continued treatment after the hospital stay for the post-intensive care syndrome may be needed,” she said.</p>
