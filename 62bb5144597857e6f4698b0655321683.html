<h1>Penguins bring back versatile forward Evan Rodrigues</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two months after trading his rights to the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Penguins on Friday brought back Evan Rodrigues, according to a source.</p>
<p>The team initially acquired Rodrigues before the NHL trade deadline in February, sending Dominik Kahun to Buffalo to get Rodrigues and Conor Sheary. Rodrigues made a positive impression in seven games before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the season, but the Penguins didn’t use him in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Then they included Rodrigues, a restricted free agent to be, in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/08/25/kasperi-kapanen-trade-penguins-maple-leafs/stories/202008250091" target="_blank">the Kasperi Kapanen trade</a>. All that sure seemed to signal that they didn’t think much of him.</p>
<p>But the Maple Leafs did not extend a qualifying offer to the 27-year-old forward and were unable to hammer out a deal with a reduced salary. Once Rodrigues reached unrestricted free agency, the Penguins moved quickly to get him back. Terms of the deal are not yet known.</p>
<p>Rodrigues gives coach Mike Sullivan a versatile option for his lineup. During his time in Buffalo, the former undrafted free agent signee played all three forward spots and was used all over the lineup. He can kill penalties. He wouldn’t look out of place on a second power play unit. And he’s a righty for key faceoffs.</p>
<p>“He’s a real utility guy that we can plug into a lot of different situations depending on what the need is of the team,” Sullivan said of Rodrigues in March.</p>
<p>After joining the Penguins in February, Rodrigues had one goal with no assists and an even plus-minus rating prior to the pause. He looked good during the postseason training camp, too. But despite the third line being a disaster for the Penguins against the Montreal Canadiens, he never got a chance to play.</p>
<p>Now, he will get another chance to earn a regular role here in 2020-21.</p>
<p>The Penguins entered Friday with just under $4 million in salary cap space, per CapFriendly. Their shopping list includes a defenseman and a goalie.</p>
