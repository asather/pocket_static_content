<h1>Burgess hears testimony, takes questions on police review board ballot referendum</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Would the voters of Pittsburgh be able to give more teeth to the Citizen Police Review Board?&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was the topic of City Council’s Wednesday public hearing that focused on Councilman Ricky Burgess’ proposal for a November ballot referendum that would ask voters to expand the board’s powers.</p>
<p>According to the proposed legislation, neither the mayor nor the police chief could issue a disciplinary decision until reviewing the board’s findings on police misconduct. The legislation also outlines confidentiality for certain investigative materials but also subjects the board meetings to the Sunshine Act and the board’s performance to audits.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure [police leaders] have the full weight of the CPRB’s determination prior to making the exoneration [of an officer]. That’s the area I was really, really laser-like focused on,” Mr. Burgess said.</p>
<p>Six speakers — four in favor, one outright against, and one questioning the measure -— spoke at the hearing chaired by Mr. Burgess and attended by Council President Theresa Kail-Smith and members R. Daniel Lavelle, Erika Strassburger, Anthony Coghill and Bobby Wilson.</p>
<p>While some council members had questions about process and language, one speaker questioned whether changes would give more power to the city.</p>
<p>“I’m concerned about the possibility of infringing on the powers of the board,” testified Tim Stevens, chair of the local Black Political Empowerment Project and member of the mayor’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/17/Pittsburgh-mayor-Bill-Peduto-names-police-reform-task-force-police-social-justice/stories/202006170107" target="_blank">police reform task force</a>.</p>
<p>“I know that often when you hear [board executive director] Beth Pittinger speak about the board, the first thing she says is the ‘independent’ citizen police review board, I think it’s extremely important in the midst of all that is going on [in] the streets across the nation, that we do everything possible to strengthen the board,” he said.&nbsp;“My request is all of you get with Ms. Pittinger and her staff and board and make sure you’re not doing something the opposite of what you want.”</p>
<p>Ms. Pittinger did not speak at the hearing but has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/06/23/ricky-burgess-pittsburgh-council-police-review-board-referendum-november-ordinance/stories/202006230085" target="_blank">previously expressed frustration</a> with not receiving&nbsp;“everything city code [already] says we’re entitled to” during investigations.</p>
<p>While the board has subpoena power, documents often arrive heavily redacted and officers asked to testify refuse, said Shawn Carter, Mr. Burgess’ special assistant.</p>
<p>“The charter amendment would require their participation or face termination, which is different than a subpoena. The subpoena power is not being removed from the board,” Mr. Carter said.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess said that the board is still an&nbsp;“instrumentality of the city” even though it’s independent. He said he’s met several times with Mayor Bill Peduto’s administration, the Department of Public Safety and the chief of police, and the review board to craft compromise referendum language that&nbsp;“all three parties ... and council as a whole can support.”</p>
<p>The councilman said he’s “working at light speed” to get a compromise in front of council next week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting to a point at which everyone can agree is the reason the councilman chose to legislate the ballot question rather than circulate a petition, Mr. Carter said, as it offers flexibility to amend the text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill comes at a time of increased protest and scrutiny over race and law enforcement after the police killing of George Floyd on Memorial Day in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The Citizen Police Review Board is currently <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/03/Pittsburgh-citizen-police-review-board-protest-east-liberty-tear-gas-floyd/stories/202006030102" target="_blank">investigating a violent clash between police and protesters that occurred on June 1 in East Liberty</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/06/24/Peduto-police-reform-activists-demands-Pittsburgh-equity/stories/202006240141" target="_blank">said on June 25</a> that he supports a&nbsp;“strong” board but that state law and police union contracts would preempt whether officers would have to participate in review board investigations.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto said he helped craft the original enabling legislation in the 1990s to establish the board.</p>
