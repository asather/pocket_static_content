<h1>Allegheny Technologies chief says Beaver County plant in jeopardy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh-based Allegheny Technologies Inc. may be forced to idle its Midland plant in Beaver County because of steel tariffs on imports imposed by the Trump administration, according to an op-ed written for the Wall Street Journal by the company’s CEO, Robert Wetherbee.</p>
<p>The closure would idle some 100 workers, according to the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Wetherbee urged the administration to approve an exemption for ATI so that it can import the nickel-bearing stainless steel slabs it needs from Indonesia at lower prices free from the tariffs. Buying American isn’t an option, he said.</p>
<p>“Our Midland plant is hemorrhaging money,” he said.</p>
<p>“President Trump’s economic policies led my company to reopen an idled steel plant two years ago, but now his steel tariffs may force us to close it,” Mr. Wetherbee said. “And we are hardly alone.”</p>
<p>“The administration could protect these workers by granting more exclusion requests,” he said.</p>
<p>“If a company proves it has no viable alternative to imports...the administration should eagerly grant exclusions. Mr. President, we implore you: Save our jobs,” Mr. Wetherbee wrote.</p>
<p>The Midland plant, which indirectly employs another 200 people, specializes in cold-rolling 60-inch stainless steel sheet used in a variety of products from kitchen appliances to car parts, he said.</p>
