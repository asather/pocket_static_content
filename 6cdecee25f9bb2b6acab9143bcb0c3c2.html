<p>Haden, who had been selected as an alternate, is replacing Baltimore cornerback Marcus Peters, who cannot play due to an injury.</p>
<p>Haden, who also made the Pro Bowl in 2013 and 2014, tied for the team lead with five interceptions last season. He’ll be joined by Cam Heyward, T.J. Watt and Minkah Fitzpatrick in Orlando next week, site of this year’s Pro Bowl game.</p>
