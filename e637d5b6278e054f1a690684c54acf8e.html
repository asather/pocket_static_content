<h1>Quigley Catholic to close at end of school year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh announced Friday that Quigley Catholic High School in Baden will close permanently at the end of the school year because of financial issues and lack of enrollment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diocese said the high school had a projected enrollment of 93 students for the 2020-21 academic year, making a full educational experience with extracurricular activities and athletics&nbsp;“virtually impossible.”</p>
<p>“I acknowledge the great sadness that comes with this announcement for Quigley students and their&nbsp;families, administrators, teachers, staff and alumni, all who are affected by this very difficult decision,” Bishop David Zubik said in a statement. “It&nbsp;is heartbreaking for me, as well.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The board of directors of the&nbsp;Catholic High Schools of the Diocese&nbsp;of Pittsburgh, Inc. recommended the closure of the school because of&nbsp;of declining enrollment, unsustainable cost projections and&nbsp;insufficient funds to assure the long-term viability of the school. Economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic compounded the existing financial issues, according to the diocese.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim Waxenfelter, acting co-principal at Quigley, said in a letter to families that the school had developed a new website and made a plea for alumni scholarship&nbsp;support this year as it tried to deal with previous financial shortfalls.</p>
<p>“Despite all our efforts, we were not able to reduce costs enough, or increase contributions&nbsp;enough to bring the budget into balance,” Mr. Waxenfelter wrote.</p>
<p>The diocese said it will provide assistance for any Quigley student that wants to enroll in another Catholic high school, and “every effort will be made” for Quigley faculty and staff to find jobs with other diocesan schools.</p>
<p>Bishop Zubik, who at one time served as a faculty member and vice principal at Quigley, said the decision to close the school&nbsp;“was, without exaggeration, agonizing.”</p>
<p>“I do know firsthand the spiritual richness and academic excellence that have defined Quigley over many decades,” Bishop Zubik said. “I pray that, with God’s grace, the Quigley spirit and legacy will remain alive for a long, long&nbsp;time.”</p>
