<h1>Stung by admission, surgery losses, Pa. hospitals scramble to ready for COVID-19 patients</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Already smarting from lower revenue from falling patient admissions and surgical procedures, Pennsylvania acute care hospitals are bracing for another hit from getting ready for patients with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Most hospitals have been winding down or postponing non-emergent surgeries to comply with Gov. Tom Wolf’s order March 17 banning elective operations. Among the surgeries are some of hospitals’ high margin procedures, such as knee and hip replacement surgery, which typically help smooth over losses racked up in providing charitable and other kinds of care.</p>
<p>“There is a legitimate, credible threat that we could see closures without state or federal support,” said Andrew Carter, president and CEO of the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, a Harrisburg-based trade group.</p>
<p>“Hospitals will close.”</p>
<p>In a call with reporters Tuesday, Mr. Carter advocated for creating an emergency fund to help struggling hospitals offset the cost of preparing for an anticipated surge of patients with COVID-19, a highly contagious respiratory disease that emerged in China in December.</p>
<p>HAP has been working with legislative leaders on details of the fund, which would aid hospitals that are already facing equipment and other shortages.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter said a similar fund in Washington State, which has been hard hit by COVID-19, was $200 million, but he declined to say the total amount needed by Pennsylvania hospitals. Hospitals could tap the fund to pay for equipment, supplies and staffing — and even housing for staffing, he said.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Carter said hospitals statewide only have enough protective gear for nurses, doctors and other health care providers to last three weeks.</p>
<p>“In some areas, we would run out in a matter of days,” he said. “There is an immediate need for more personal protective equipment, which is our priority right now.”</p>
<p>Moreover, some of the stored equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile, the safety net reserve of medical equipment, doesn’t meet standards for usage, he said.</p>
<p>“We’re talking about thousands of items being used a day at some facilities,” Mr. Carter said.</p>
<p>Most hospitals in the state have stopped doing elective surgical procedures after Gov. Wolf’s order, which has been a financial hit for hospitals, Mr. Carter said. At one unnamed Pennsylvania hospital, elective surgical procedures usually generate 80% of the facility’s revenue.</p>
<p>On average, surgical procedures, such as hip and knee replacements, have higher margins than a hospital admission without sophisticated medical intervention, said Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. Eventually, hospitals could recoup the revenue being lost during the crisis, providing the procedure can be rescheduled.</p>
<p>For an uncomplicated case of COVID-19, Medicare fee-for-service pays Pittsburgh-area hospitals $6,748 for the patient’s care, or about half of the $14,552 paid for knee replacement surgery, Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p>COVID-19 had infected a documented 851 people in Pennsylvania as of noon Tuesday. Two people have died from the disease in Allegheny County, which has no known cure but that hits different people at varying levels of severity. Some experience very mild symptoms.</p>
<p>Seventy people have been hospitalized in the state since the first case was identified March 6, but that number is expected to rise, Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine said.</p>
<p>“We are continuing to see this exponential rise in new cases, with a doubling of new cases every two or three days,” she said during a news conference. “There’s every reason to believe this rise will continue.”</p>
<p>Hospital officials worry about the anticipated increase in patients while dealing with a years-long trend of declining patient admissions and surgical procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the 12 months ending June 30, 2019 —&nbsp;the most recent full year results are available —&nbsp;30 hospitals in Western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, or 49% of the 61 hospitals surveyed, reported a loss from operations, according to the Healthcare Council of Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Eighty percent of the 61 hospitals reported fewer patient admissions during the year -—a decline that was&nbsp;attributed to increases in people with high-deductible health insurance plans, coinsurance and co-pays that have reduced the number of surgical cases and emergency room visits.</p>
<p>The decision to postpone non-emergent surgery during the COVID-19 crisis is based on clinical, rather than hospital revenue considerations, said Jane Montgomery, COO, Healthcare Council of Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“The issue for hospitals is always patient safety,” Ms. Montgomery said.</p>
<p>Postponing operations “will have an impact on their bottom line; elective surgeries do have a margin. But they’re not going to jeopardize anything that’s needed.”</p>
