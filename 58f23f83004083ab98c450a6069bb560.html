<h1>Obama halts Allderdice's record streak to claim first City League championship, 50-39</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allderdice entered Petersen Events Center on Saturday in the midst of the most prolonged stretch of dominance in the history of City League basketball, having won six championships in a row.</p>
<p>It took all of 32 minutes for Obama to put an end to the Dragons’ dynasty.</p>
<p>The game wasn’t pretty from an offensive standpoint, but both sides had their moments. In the end, the Eagles (14-8) outlasted Allderdice (18-6) to claim their first City League crown in school history, 50-39.</p>
<p>Senior forward Sean Snead dominated in the paint on his way to a game-high 17 points for Obama, while Tony Henderson led the way for the Dragons with 14 points. Eagles junior Sayon Bennett tallied 12 points and freshman Tariq Francis scored 10, including a clutch 3-pointer to ice away the game late in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Obama couldn’t have asked for a better start to the game, as the Eagles jumped out to a 9-0 lead midway through the first quarter. A jumper from senior guard Sean Graves got the Dragons on the board, and they slowly started climbing back into the game. Allderdice junior Kiere Henning made a fastbreak layup just before the end of the first half, and Obama took a 19-17 lead into the break.</p>
<p>Senior Tony Henderson drained a 3-pointer on the opening possession of the second half to give the Dragons their first lead of the game, 20-19. The teams traded leads throughout the third quarter before the Eagles went back on top, 29-28, entering the fourth.</p>
<p>Allderdice briefly regained the lead, 30-29, on a mid-range jumper by Graves, but that’s when Obama took over. Snead grabbed an offensive rebound and made a putback to give the Eagles a 35-32 lead midway through the final quarter, then Francis nailed a huge 3-pointer to give Obama a 43-35 lead with a little less than two minutes left.</p>
<p>From there, Bennett and Angelo Meyers Jr. converted several clutch free throws to seal the Eagles’ historic championship win.</p>
