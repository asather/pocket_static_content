<h1>Burgess, Lavelle to CMU: Invest in communities that were left blank on map</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council members Ricky Burgess and Daniel Lavelle are calling on Carnegie Mellon University to invest in African-American neighborhoods following an incident in which the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/02/05/Carnegie-Mellon-map-homewood-Hill-District-Lincoln-Lemington-garfield-race-admissions-Pittsburgh/stories/202002050132" target="_blank">university published a map that omitted several of those communities</a>.</p>
<p>In a two-page letter sent Wednesday morning to CMU’s president and board of directors, the councilmen urged the university to join the city in discussions on equity and race and to invest in a fund established to support equitable investing.</p>
<p>“We acknowledge that the university took ownership of this incident and apologized to the community. However, one cannot help but view this in the context of decades of overt racial and economic discrimination in the city,” the letter read.&nbsp;“Perhaps the university’s significant lack of public investment in the city and specifically its African-American communities may be to blame.”</p>
<p>The map, published online several weeks ago by the university’s admissions office, highlighted certain areas of the city as destinations for prospective students but left unacknowledged several historic black neighborhoods, including the Hill District, the home of Pulitzer Prize winning playwright August Wilson.</p>
<p>“Both of our districts have legacies,” Mr. Burgess said. “There’s culture and history in those neighborhoods, but there’s also vitality, possibility and potential in those neighborhoods right now.”</p>
<p>In a written statement, the university maintains it is&nbsp;“deeply committed to partnering with government, higher education, community and business leaders to build a better city for all.”</p>
<p>“We appreciate the constructive outreach from the Pittsburgh City Council members, and we have already reached out to them to schedule time to further this important dialogue. Our students, faculty and staff are directly engaged in neighborhoods across the city in service, community driven-research and other outreach programs,” wrote a spokesperson for the Squirrel Hill-based university.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess said he and Mr. Lavelle talked for days after the CMU map came to light. They both had planned to ask local tax-exempt large nonprofits in the city to invest in the city-led&nbsp;“All-In Pittsburgh Investment Fund,” established by <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/12/05/Racism-public-health-crisis-Pittsburgh-city-council-Burgess-Lavelle-inequality-gender-race/stories/201912050123" target="_blank">legislation in December</a>. The map expedited their plan.</p>
<p>Since 2014 Mayor Bill Peduto has been pushing for an arrangement in which large tax-exempt nonprofits, including UPMC and the universities, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/04/14/Mayor-Peduto-OnePGH-report-pittsburgh-raise-critical-needs-tax-exempt-organizations/stories/201904110090" target="_blank">contribute to a 501c3 fund to address the city’s&nbsp;“critical needs” </a>rather than give voluntary payments in lieu of taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The administration is reviewing the letter, which we received this afternoon,” said Timothy McNulty, mayoral spokesman. “The mayor of course supports the All-In initiative from the councilmen.”</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto is a voting trustee on the CMU board.</p>
<p>The two-page Burgess-Lavelle letter highlights the university’s tax-exempt nonprofit status and references other higher education institutions’ investments in African-American communities, including the Community College of Allegheny County’s Homewood branch and the University of Pittsburgh’s community engagement centers in Homewood and the Hill District.</p>
<p>“Why not begin having an actual relationship with the African-American community? Why not leverage [CMU’s] resources and expertise to uplift the African-American communities they have left blank on their map?” Mr. Lavelle said.</p>
<p>The letter also cites the recent city-commissioned report that found African Americans’ life expectancy, infant mortality rates, and several other health and economic outcomes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/09/17/Pittsburgh-black-population-better-life-quality-comparable-city-gender-equity-commission-race/stories/201909170114" target="_blank">trail far behind in Pittsburgh than in other comparable cities</a>. The report was authored by University of Pittsburgh sociologists in conjunction with the city’s Gender Equity Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess said he is aware of internal efforts at CMU to address diversity as well as a partnership between the city’s Human Relations Commission and the CMU CREATE Lab to use data visualization to highlight the connection between race, gender, and poverty as they relate to housing options in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Megan Stanley, commission director, said she has found the CMU lab staff to be&nbsp;“very thoughtful about intersectional issues uncovered through data.”</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess said he would like to see a&nbsp;“place-based strategy” from the university — meaning investment in physical locations and interactions in the communities.</p>
