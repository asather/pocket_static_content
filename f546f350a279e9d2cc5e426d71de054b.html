<h1>Pirates' Dovydas Neverauskas waits out COVID-19 delay a long way from home</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In theory, Dovydas Neverauskas could have gone home to Lithuania when the COVID-19 pandemic began to ramp up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn’t exactly practical, though, and the Pirates’ Lithuanian right-hander understands that.</p>
<p>For one, Neverauskas was fearful of the possibility of bringing the virus back to Lithuania with him and infecting his family. Plus, he wouldn’t have been able to exercise or pitch with necessary regularity, he wouldn’t know if he’d be able to get back into the U.S. right away when baseball returns and he would likely have to quarantine himself for two weeks even if he did get back into the states.</p>
<p>So for Neverauskas, even though there’s probably some sentimentality that would lure him home, the decision to stay in Bradenton, Fla., wasn’t that tough in the end.</p>
<p>“Getting it by myself and bringing it to my family, that would be the worst case scenario,” Neverauskas told the Post-Gazette. “If I get sick and then bring it to my home, it’s like, now what? I feel like I would get better treatment here. I bet the team would help me a lot more in this. But yeah, I feel like I’m not putting my family in danger, so that was the first thing. And then the two-week quarantine myself, just sitting in my room for two weeks, that’s another thing, and then it comes down to coming back to the states. That’s the last step. So I decided to avoid it all the same and just stay here.”</p>
<p>The tough part of it for Neverauskas, then, is the same thing that’s been tough on everybody during the pandemic. He lives by himself, and he’s going a little stir-crazy.</p>
<p>Neverauskas at least gets the benefit of getting to see his teammates every now and then as he’s been working out at the Pirates’ spring training facility in Bradenton, but beyond that, he says he doesn’t do much.</p>
<p>“I feel like you get that every day. I feel like everybody is like that,” Neverauskas said. “Some days, you feel pissed about it, because you can’t do anything. It sucks. You wake up, and it’s another day at home. You’re not going to go anywhere. It’s just sitting at home all the time, just not being able to go anywhere. You get so bored. How many shows can you watch? How many movies do you get to watch?”</p>
<p>On the other hand, in Lithuania, things are starting to open back up again. While most businesses remain closed, open-air cafes have re-opened along with drive-in movie theaters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That isn’t much, and large groups are still discouraged, but it’s something. Neverauskas sees that, and there’s surely part of him that wishes he could be there, especially given that Wednesday was his mother’s birthday. But the way he sees it, he wouldn’t be in Lithuania during this time of the year anyway.</p>
<p>“My family didn’t say anything about it,” Neverauskas said. “My dad supported me because he said, ‘Gyms are closed here. You can’t practice here. So, you’d better stay there where you can practice.’</p>
<p>“... Nobody says to come back and stuff. I mean, I was supposed to be gone no matter what. This was supposed to be my season. I was supposed to be not home. So just being here with the opportunity to practice, that’s the key here right now.”</p>
<p>This is just the reality of the situation for Neverauskas. Bradenton is the best spot for him to stay prepared for whenever the 2020 season begins. That comes with some sacrifice, including the knowledge that his friends and family back home are starting to be able to mingle around in public again, but with all the factors involved, there wasn’t much of a decision to be made in the end.</p>
<p>“I’m not really jealous,” Neverauskas said. “I’m pretty sure this is going to happen [here], too. I would like to be in Lithuania. That’s where I like to be. It’s my home. But I’ve still got to think about my work.”</p>
