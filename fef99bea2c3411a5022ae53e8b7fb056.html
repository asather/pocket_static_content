<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>HARTFORD, Conn. —&nbsp;A University of Connecticut student, who police say used a machete to kill a man, fatally shot a high school acquaintance, and then spent six days as a fugitive, will be arraigned Friday on murder and other charges, authorities said.</p>
<p>Peter Manfredonia, 23, will be arraigned in Rockville Superior Court in the May 22 death of Ted DeMers in nearby Willington, Connecticut, Trooper Josue Dorelus said at a news briefing.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether Manfredonia has an attorney who could comment on his behalf about the charges.</p>
<p>Manfredonia is accused of killing DeMers, 62, and seriously wounding another man in the machete attack.</p>
<p>Two days later, police say, Manfredonia stole a truck and guns and fatally shot high school acquaintance Nicholas Eisele, 23, in Derby, Connecticut.</p>
<p>He is being held on a $5 million bond. He is charged with murder, criminal attempt to commit murder, assault, home invasion, kidnapping with a firearm, robbery, larceny, stealing a firearm and assault on an elderly person.</p>
<p>State police said further charges will be filed in Eisele’s death and the kidnapping of Eisele’s girlfriend, who was later found unharmed in New Jersey.</p>
<p>“Our hope is that the developments that will be provided today will give the families and communities impacted some kind of closure,” Dorelus said.</p>
<p>Manfredonia was arrested May 27 after six days on the run across several states when he walked out of a wooded area in Maryland and surrendered. He declined to fight extradition back to Connecticut during a brief court hearing the day after his capture.</p>
