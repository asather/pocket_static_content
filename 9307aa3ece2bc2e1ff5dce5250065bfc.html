<p>HARRISBURG — State officials will ease some COVID-19 restrictions next week in 24 northwest and north-central counties, the first step in the Wolf administration’s plan to gradually reopen Pennsylvania by region.</p>

<p>At 2 p.m., Gov. Tom Wolf will announce that these counties can enter the “yellow” phase of a tiered reopening plan on May 8, according to administration officials.</p>
<p>The counties allowed to do so are Bradford, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lycoming, McKean, Mercer, Montour, Northumberland, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, Union, Venango, and Warren.</p>
<p>In this phase, child care operations can resume and retail stores can reopen to customers, though curbside pickup and delivery remains preferable and certain safety precautions must be taken. Some businesses that cannot accommodate telework will be allowed to resume in-person operations, though they must provide masks to workers and ensure proper social distancing.</p>
<p>Gyms, theaters, and schools will remain closed, and gatherings of more than 25 people will be prohibited. Restaurants and bars will only be permitted to remain open for takeout.</p>
<p>The next step is the “green" phase, where most restrictions are lifted. Mr. Wolf has warned counties can return to a previous phase should cases spike again.</p>
<p>In March, Mr. Wolf shuttered much of the state’s economy and began implementing stay-at-home orders to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by cases of COVID-19. As GOP lawmakers pressured the governor to lift restrictions on some impacted sectors, Mr. Wolf announced he would allow construction to resume statewide and golf courses, campgrounds, and marinas to reopen, as long as precautions are taken on site.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf has also increased the number of state-run wine and spirits stores that can offer curbside pickup.</p>
