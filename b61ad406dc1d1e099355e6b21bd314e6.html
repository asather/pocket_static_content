<h1>Allegheny County Council panel gives negative recommendation to universal jail, Kane testing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County Council’s Committee on Public Safety has given a negative recommendation to universal COVID-19 testing in the Allegheny County Jail and the Kane Regional Centers.</p>
<p>The bill, sponsored by members Bethany Hallam, D-at large, and Olivia Bennett, D-Northview Heights, was introduced on May 19 and was held in committee June 3.</p>
<p>Ms. Hallam and Ms. Bennett on Wednesday voted in favor of an affirmative recommendation.</p>

<p>Committee members Bob Macey, D-West Mifflin; Cindy Kirk, R-McCandless; Paul Klein, D-Shadyside, and Sam DeMarco, R-at large, voted against.</p>
<p>Ms. Hallam described the committee vote as “very disappointing” and said she was willing to compromise.</p>
<p>“It's very frustrating that there's these little incremental changes we could make to change people's lives and council members can't find the courage,” she said. “… What would it hurt to test everyone in the jail?"</p>

<p>Representatives of the Kane long-term care facilities and the Allegheny County Jail were present on the committee’s telemeeting.</p>
<p>Mr. DeMarco said that he voted “no” because officials are already&nbsp;“taking the best steps they can” and following the state and federal guidelines.</p>
<p>“Why would I [vote in favor] if they're already doing the work necessary to protect the folks at the Kanes and at the jail?” he said. “We heard from those folks for 70 minutes today.”</p>
<p>He also called Ms. Hallam’s bill&nbsp;“flawed” because it doesn’t have a sunset date.</p>
<p>A public link to the meeting was not readily available.</p>
