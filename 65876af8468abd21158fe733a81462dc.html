<h1>N.J. state parks, golf courses to reopen Saturday in 1st big change to lift lockdown orders</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>State and county parks, as well as golf courses, may reopen Saturday morning in the first major move Gov. Phil Murphy has made to begin lifting the near-lockdown orders he has implemented to slow the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Murphy made the announcement Wednesday afternoon, saying he will sign an executive order to take effect at sunrise Saturday and that “social distancing will continue to be mandated.”</p>
<p>The news came less than an hour before Murphy was set to hold in his daily press briefing in Trenton, in which he provides the latest update on coronavirus cases and deaths in the state.</p>

<p>Murphy reversed course on parks and golf courses after weeks of intense criticism from Republicans and residents who said he had gone too far with his orders during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The criticism heightened in the last 24 hours when state Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, and a bipartisan group of state senators called on the Democratic governor to begin allowing parks, golf courses, beaches, and some businesses to begin reopening as long as they adhere to social distancing guidelines that takeout eateries and grocery stores are using.</p>
<p>“I don’t golf,” Sweeney told NJ Advance Media on Tuesday night. “But if they can adhere to the standards the governor is putting out, why not let them open?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, neighboring New York and Pennsylvania announced in recent days they were allowing parks and golf courses to reopen with social-distancing restrictions.</p>
<p>New Jersey, a densely populated state of 9 million residents, has the second-most COVID-19 cases and related deaths among U.S. states, after New York. Officials say the state has seen at least 6,442 deaths attributed to the virus, with at least 113,856 cases as of Tuesday.</p>
<p>Last month, Murphy began issuing broad and unprecedented restrictions to help curb the virus’ spread, including ordering residents to stay home, banning social gatherings, closing schools, and mandating non essential businesses close.</p>
<p>The governor added state and county parks April 7, saying it was needed to prevent crowds from gathering as the weather got warmer.</p>
<p>A poll from Monmouth University last week showed a vast majority of New Jersey adults agree with Murphy’s restrictions, though the percentage of those who agree with the park closings was lower than others -- 70%.</p>
<p>Don’t be shocked if parks and courses are crowded this weekend. The National Weather Service is forecasting heavy rain Thursday and Friday in New Jersey, but sunny skies with highs in the 60s on Saturday. Temperatures could hit 70 on Sunday.</p>
<p>As for the rest of Murphy’s orders? On Monday, the governor unveiled a broad road map outlining the steps New Jersey needs to take before his can begin gradually lifting his restrictions.</p>
<p>But Murphy did not provide a specific timetable, and he said the order will stay “in its entirety until further notice."</p>
<p>Murphy said officials first need to see a 14-day trend showing drops in numbers, at least double the state’s testing capacity, and institute plans for robust contact tracing and isolation of the infected.</p>
<p>Though coronavirus cases and deaths keep growing by the day in New Jersey, the state has seen a drop in the number of hospitalizations for 15 days.</p>
<p>More than 850,000 New Jersey residents have filed for unemployment since aggressive social distancing began, and there have been untold business losses.</p>
