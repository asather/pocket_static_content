<h1>If Steelers protest, they'll have Mike Tomlin's support</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said he and the organization will fully support his players with whatever action they choose to take regarding the social injustice problems that have engulfed the country, but asks only that they use their platform to do it “thoughtfully” and “with class.”</p>
<p>He also said two of his players tested positive for COVID-19, but that was back in the spring and both are OK now.</p>
<p>In a Zoom call on Tuesday with Pittsburgh-area media, Tomlin talked about several issues confronting his team, including the lack of on-field reps that have restricted development of his young players and created “anxiety” about the physical readiness of his team when, and if, the regular season begins.</p>
<p>But Tomlin said he has used a lot of the team’s virtual meetings to talk with players about the ongoing issues regarding racial and social injustice in the U.S. He said he let them know he supports whatever action they choose to make, whether on social media or in the form of protests at games or society.</p>
<p>“We’ve focused our energy on supporting our players and their wishes,” Tomlin said, his first public comments since the NFL draft in April. “Our position is simple — we’re going to support our players and their willingness to partake in this, whether it’s statements or action. Statements are good, but impact is better. Those who have a desire to participate in a positive way are going to be supported by us. All that we ask is whatever it is they say and do, they do so thoughtfully and they do with class.”</p>
<p>Tomlin said the situation is different now than in 2017 when kneeling protests sprung up during the national anthem around the league. The Steelers got caught in an unwitting yet awkward position before a game in Chicago that season when Alejandro Villanueva was shown in a tunnel standing with his hand over his heart. Now, Tomlin said the Steelers have had plenty of time to discuss the issues with their players.</p>
<p>They have also set up a structural committee headed by assistant head coach John Mitchell and director of community relations Blayre Holmes to help discuss and react to the issues.</p>
<p>“We have talked openly with those guys that a lot of things that they say and do are going to be weaponized one way or another for political reasons,” Tomlin said. “And so we asked them to pause and really be thoughtful about the things that they say and do with that understanding. We feel good about the traction that we have gained in that area.”</p>
<p>Meantime, Tomlin and the 31 other NFL head coaches are dealing with another issue — how to get their teams ready for a regular season with no OTAs or minicamp and the possibility of not having preseason games, either.</p>
<p>Tomlin said he “assumes” there will be preseason games, but if those are canceled, that will only restrict the evaluation and conditioning process the Steelers — and every other NFL team — have already encountered.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of snaps —&nbsp;Tomlin estimated the number at approximately 900 — and the potential of no preseason games, he said it will be important to rely on players who are experienced and not trying to learn a position or assignment. To highlight his point, he said right tackle Matt Feiler will begin training camp at left guard for retired Ramon Foster, and Chukwuma Okorafor and Zach Banner will battle for the right tackle position. Tyson Alualu will be the nose tackle who replaces Javon Hargrave.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean Feiler will remain at left guard. The Steelers signed veteran guard Stefen Wisniewski in free agency and drafted Kevin Dotson from Louisiana in the fourth round. Wisniewski, in particular, will be given a chance to start at left guard, particularly if the battle at right tackle between Okorafor and Banner does not go well.</p>
<p>“We’re acknowledging as a staff we have to make some quick decisions and then kind of roll from there,” Tomlin said.</p>
<p>“No question that we as coaches will have less tools for the evaluation process, just in terms of volume. The number of snaps will be significantly less. You have to also acknowledge that there is an element of teaching that has been lost in the virtual offseason and that could affect the competition, at least at the initial stages.”</p>
<p>Maybe more important, Tomlin said physical readiness will be a significant factor, as well. Medical opinions around the league have already stated concern about an increase in injuries because of a lack of preseason work.</p>
<p>“There’s some anxiety associated with that,” Tomlin said. “Those snaps not only allow guys to learn what to do in the game, detailing their work, but also allows them to really start the process of physical conditioning and preparation for the football season. That level of conditioning is lost. I don’t want to underscore that. That is significant. We have concerns in that area, as I am sure everyone does.</p>
<p>“The physical reps are a teaching tool and it levels the playing field once we get in training camp for new guys or young guys. Learning is going to be a significant element of this process. Those who are slow learners, who lack the normal repetitions that you get in the spring, are going to be working at a disadvantage. By the same token, those who have been here and know what to do are probably working at a distinct advantage in this environment.”</p>
<p>Then he added, “I’m not comfortable but I imagine none of my peers are comfortable, either, so I’m comfortable with that. Physical conditioning is going to be a significant element of this process. It doesn’t lessen the anxiety. You better have a group of guys who come ready to work from a physical standpoint.”</p>
<p>Tomlin said he has not been around Ben Roethlisberger to see a workout and evaluate his progress from elbow surgery. But everything he has heard about his quarterback’s recovery has been very satisfying — not to mention being on schedule for the start of the 2020 season, whenever that is.</p>
<p>"He's comfortable and pleased with where he is,” Tomlin said. “Some people who had the opportunity to work with him are impressed and pleased with where he is. The medical experts are comfortable with where he is in the rehabilitation process and his overall readiness for 2020."</p>
