<h1>Owner of lab doing critical COVID-19 testing pleaded guilty to Medicare fraud in January</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A couple weeks ago, Ravitej Reddy and management at MHS Labs in Monroeville realized there was a large gap in testing for COVID-19 cases in southwestern Pennsylvania: No one was testing broadly and returning quick results for nursing homes.</p>
<p>Within just two weeks they signed up to test about 200 nursing homes, where large groups of those most vulnerable to the harshest impacts of the respiratory disease live.</p>

<p>The lab, owned by Mr. Reddy, has helped identify some of the region’s worst nursing home outbreaks already, including at <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/06/Brighton-Rehab-and-Wellness-Beaver-PA-nursing-home-coronavirus-positive-cases/stories/202004060124" target="_blank">Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center</a> in Beaver County, the Allegheny County-owned <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/14/Resident-Kane-Glen-Hazel-died-COVID-19-coronavirus/stories/202004140070?cid=search" target="_blank">Kane Community Living Center in Glen Hazel</a>, and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/north/2020/04/07/2-die-of-COVID-19-at-St-Barnabas-Nursing-Home-additional-18-test-positive/stories/202004070096" target="_blank">St. Barnabas</a>.</p>
<p>But because of events dating back to November, MHS Lab’s role in the COVID-19 fight here might not necessarily make sense to anyone who reads stories out of federal criminal court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>How could Mr. Reddy, 52, be allowed by the federal government to use his lab to test residents in nursing homes — with many if not all their COVID-19 tests covered by Medicare — just three months after he pleaded guilty in federal court to a massive Medicare fraud case involving different tests?</p>
<p>Mr. Reddy was accused in a complaint Nov. 26, and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/10/Lab-owner-admits-role-in-Medicare-ripoff-scheme/stories/202001100114?cid=search" target="_blank">pleaded guilty on Jan. 10, to being part of a scheme</a> to defraud Medicare of $127 million over various tests involving fraudulent test prescriptions. He admitted he received kickbacks from six partners in four states for agreeing to be the lab that was sent the test samples initially, and agreed to pay back $77 million.</p>
<p>His defense attorney, Mark Rush, himself a former federal prosecutor, said the answer is a combination of what Mr. Reddy pleaded guilty to, and what his lab is now doing in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“He pled guilty to a violation of the anti-kickback statute,” Mr. Rush said. “What he pled guilty to had nothing to do with patient care, or the quality of the testing his labs do.”</p>
<p>The scheme involved both MHS Labs — which is also known as Med Health Services Management —&nbsp;and another lab Mr. Reddy owns, called Personalized Genetics LLC, which does not do COVID-19 testing.</p>
<p>But, in addition, Mr. Rush said: “I don’t think [the Department of Justice] would want to impact the function that MHS is playing now in response to the pandemic in Western Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>At least one local legal expert said that is a true consideration in a case like this:</p>
<p>“This is one of those other, many inexplicable twists of COVID-19,” said Bruce Antkowiak, a law professor at St. Vincent College and former federal prosecutor.&nbsp;“You don’t generally see something like this happen, where the person accused of defrauding the federal government, after pleading and before sentencing, becomes an indispensable part of the response to a pandemic.”</p>
<p>“Anything is possible” and the lab could be closed by the federal government, “But it’s very unlikely the federal government will move to shut down his lab any time soon” given the COVID-19 testing the lab is doing.</p>
<p>“I’d be very shocked to see that happen and circumvent the work his lab is doing,” he said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Scott Brady, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, did not return a request for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Rush said that when Mr. Reddy’s sentencing is completed months if not more than a year from now — a process that will be at least delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic that has closed most federal court proceedings — he could still be forced to either sell or relinquish control of the labs.</p>
<p>“Ultimately when this case is fully resolved that will be decided then,” he said.</p>
<p>The lab could be seen by federal prosecutors as a tangible asset that Mr. Reddy is forced to sell to help pay back his considerable restitution. As part of his plea he agreed to pay back $77 million. The case information said that his labs received $60 million in reimbursement from Medicare on the $127 million in billings that were part of the scheme.</p>
<p>In addition, as Mr. Reddy himself pointed out in an interview: “The lab was not included in the” charging information, which the federal government could have done.</p>
<p>And for now, at least, “The lab is functioning normally.”</p>
<p>In fact, more recently, Mr. Reddy and MHS Labs decided to expand into another niche: A drive-through COVID-19 testing service for people to get tested after a tele-health visit with a local doctor outside of the region’s health systems and hospitals, which now do nearly all of the testing. They expect a similar response to the nursing home testing.</p>
<p>At least several entities involved in the COVID-19 response hope that it continues to function.</p>
<p>“They’re doing important work with the nursing homes,” said Dr. Stacy Lane, co-founder of Central Outreach Wellness Center. “It would be a shame to lose them. We need them right now.”</p>
<p>Dr. Lane’s state-funded clinic, with locations in the North Shore, Aliquippa and Washington, was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/16/Pittsburgh-COVID-19-coronavirus-screening-test-drive-thru-central-outreach-wellness-center/stories/202003160125" target="_blank">the only entity doing COVID-19 drive-through testing when it started </a>testing people in mid-March. It ended operations last week after demand fell sharply once UPMC, AHN and other health care systems started their own more frequent COVID-19 testing.</p>
<p>But Dr. Lane said she knew in early March that nursing homes were struggling to get enough testing done and she was glad to see it when MHS Labs began providing test kits and quick turnaround time on tests three weeks ago for nursing homes.</p>
<p>“No one else was able to do it,” she said, since testing kits were in short supply and turnaround time for national commercial labs was so slow.</p>
<p>Dennis Biondo, director of the Allegheny County-owned Kane Community Living Center nursing homes, said in an emailed statement that the county began using MHS just last week as it ramped up testing in its four nursing homes in Glen Hazel, Scott, Ross and McKeesport.</p>
<p>He said the decision to use them, as other nursing homes like Brighton Rehabilitation have said, was “because they are local we can have our drivers (with proper protection and protocols) deliver the swabs to the lab and don’t have to wait for a courier or make other arrangements for a pickup.”</p>
<p>“They approached us about using their service via a telephone call and I am aware that other nursing homes are using their services. Since the lab is still authorized to provide this service, during this crisis we are using every resource available and the need for quick testing is a significant factor in our decision regarding testing for COVID,” Mr. Biondo said in the statement.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of our credentialing review that we do for similar services and will act accordingly based on the results of that review. Currently, though, they have a PA Permit to test for COVID-19 and are not excluded from the Medicare program.”</p>
<p>Mr. Reddy said that he decided to pursue doing COVID-19 testing as “more of a community service” because “as any lab can tell you, this isn’t a money maker.”</p>
<p>Other labs have argued that at least with federal reimbursement at $51, the testing itself could barely break even, if not cost the labs money. Mr. Reddy argues that with swabs — used to take samples from a person's nose or throat — alone costing from $7 to $14 a piece at times, instead of the normal $1 to $2 each, it would be hard to make any money on a COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>Doing such a “community service” could also play a role when Mr. Reddy appears before a federal judge at some point in the future, though Mr. Reddy insists he is doing it with noble intentions.</p>
<p>Even so, Mr. Rush said: “It’s certainly something that I’m going to make the court aware of.”</p>
