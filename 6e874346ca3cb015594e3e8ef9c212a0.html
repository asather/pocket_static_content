<h1>Clairton celebrates start of $17-million housing-commercial project in its battered business district </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A block of Miller Avenue in downtown Clairton resembled an autumn festival Friday morning with a tent set up in the center and tables of food and drinks lining both sides of the street.</p>
<p>The town’s mayor, Rich Lattanzi, was so excited about the event that he had trouble sleeping the night before.</p>
<p>The occasion was monumental for the battered Mon Valley steeltown: a groundbreaking for a nearly $17-million commercial-residential project that officials like Mr. Lattanzi are banking on to reignite Clairton’s central business district.</p>
<p>Clairton Inn, which straddles the block where Miller Avenue meets St. Clair Avenue, will include 49 units of affordable housing and street-level retail including space for the Clairton Public Library.</p>
<p>An existing historic structure that once housed the Clairton Inn hotel will be renovated and two nearby buildings will be demolished to make way for new construction.</p>
<p>The new and old sections will be connected for a total 70,000 square feet of space.</p>
<p>The bulk of financing came from the sale of Pennsylvania Housing Finance Authority tax credits that were awarded to project developer Mon Valley Initiative.</p>
<p>PNC Financial Services Group bought the tax credits in a deal that generated about $12 million in construction equity.</p>
<p>Additional funds came from Allegheny County, MVI, the state Department of Community and Economic Development, and nonprofit Economic Development South.</p>
<p>The library, which is more than a century old and now occupies space across the street on Miller Avenue, will occupy about 5,000 square feet in the new Clairton Inn.</p>
<p>Felix Fusco, library board member, said the city of Clairton will hold a lease on the space and the library will have input on its design.</p>
<p>The library, which receives $50,000 in annual operating funds from the city, is fundraising to cover costs of designing and moving into its new space, said Mr. Fusco.</p>
<p>“This is for the residents and people of Clairton who been so patient for so many years,” Mr. Lattanzi said in detailing the many challenges in bringing the Clairton Inn project to fruition.</p>
<p>Following the collapse of the region’s industrial base in the 1980s, the city spent 29 years under the state’s Act 47 oversight program for distressed communities.</p>
<p>While U.S. Steel remains its largest employer, most shops, banks, and other businesses that once lined Miller Street are vacant and the city’s population has dropped to 7,000 from 25,000 in the post-World War II boom years.</p>
<p>After it emerged from state oversight in 2016, city and regional development officials began seeking ways to create new business in Clairton and in 2017 received nearly $3 million through the state’s Neighborhood Partnership Program.</p>
<p>BNYMellon and Highmark committed to fund the NPP which allowed the city and development partners to meet with residents and craft initiatives including Clairton Inn and the Produce Marketplace, a store on St. Clair Avenue that helps fill the gap for fresh foods for residents in the town that no longer has a full grocery store.</p>
<p>The NPP also helped the city remediate some vacant lots and parcels and support plans for affordable housing for low-income residents such as the units at Clairton Inn.</p>
<p>MVI also plans to offer workforce training and financial education at the Clairton Inn site.</p>
<p>Mr. Lattanzi noted that Clairton’s first application for PHFA tax credits was turned down but elected officials and other partners including the MVI pushed hard to eventually win the financing tool.</p>
<p>“We had to do a lot of arm-twisting,” said Dennis Davin, secretary of Community &amp; Economic Development for Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Clairton’s ability to emerge from Act 47 and tighten its budget helped its case for financing, he said.</p>
<p>Tina Ford, a lifelong Clairton resident whose 23-year-old son, Armani Ford, a former star quarterback at Clairton High School, was shot to death in the city last year, said after Friday’s groundbreaking that the new development represents “a need for change in Clairton.”</p>
<p>“It’s time for us to grow,” said Ms. Ford, pointing to vacant storefronts that once housed a bank, tailor and doctor’s office on Miller Avenue.</p>
<p>She said she purchased her first pieces of furniture in one of the empty structures that will be demolished for Clairton Inn.</p>
<p>After her son’s death, Ms. Ford started a support group for mothers who children have been murdered as a way to give back to the community.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to leave Clairton,” she said. “I’m glad it’s coming back to what it was.”</p>
