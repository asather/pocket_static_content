<h1>With eyes on the fall, some schools to bring in students for summer instruction</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Now that all of southwestern Pennsylvania has entered the&nbsp;“green phase” of the state’s reopening plan, schools in the region soon will have the green light to reopen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state Department of Education this month said schools in counties where some of the COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted can resume in-person instruction and other activities at brick-and-mortar locations in July.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But just because schools can open their doors does not mean they will. Schools throughout the area, including Pittsburgh Public Schools, decided weeks ago to shift summer educational programming online. At the same time, many school leaders&nbsp;have already turned their attention toward the upcoming academic year.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re in the process of trying to figure out what reopening is going to look like in the fall,” said Jeffrey Fuller, superintendent of the Freedom Area School District. “That’s our primary focus.”</p>
<p>The Department of Education said schools in the less-restrictive yellow and green phases of the state’s reopening plan could begin in-person instruction as soon as July 1 if school boards adopt&nbsp;health and safety procedures that adhere to state and federal guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guidelines include limiting large gatherings, implementing protocols for cleaning and hygiene, and monitoring symptoms of illnesses. Schools will&nbsp;also <span style="font-size: 10pt;">have to name a pandemic coordinator.</span></p>

<p>The Laurel Highlands Schools District, which plans to hold some middle school remediation and physical education classes on campus this summer, will have a nurse in each building to observe students’ health, according to Superintendent Jesse Wallace. If a case of COVID-19 is suspected, he said, the district will follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The district is making masks optional, but it will encourage social distancing, cleaning surfaces regularly and will not provide transportation for students.</p>
<p>Mr. Wallace said Laurel Highlands has certain advantages when it comes to reopening as a small district with about 3,100 students. The summer programs will have only about six students per class, and there will only be six to eight classes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, he said, the district usually holds a wider range of summer programming for students, which is just not feasible this year.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be very, very restricted this year compared to what we usually do,” Mr. Wallace said.&nbsp;“We usually offer an elementary program, a middle school program and a high school program, and this year we’ve really scaled that back based on the COVID issues.”</p>
<p>Even though summer programming needs to be different this year, Tracy Vitale, superintendent of the Seneca Valley School District, said community stakeholders have told her that in-person instruction would be valuable for students.</p>
<p>“We did want to be prepared as soon as we were given permission to get kids back as soon as possible even if they were in small groups and even if it looks different than last summer,” Ms. Vitale said. “We have heard from a number of our parents and a number of our community members that they feel it’s very important for children and our students to have face-to-face contact.”</p>
<p>Seneca Valley has been preparing for the return of students for months. Ms. Vitale said she thought that a return during the summer was possible because, as a board member of Butler Memorial Hospital, she has closely followed the COVID-19 levels in the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>School staff members who have been coming to the buildings have been wearing masks unless they are working alone in an office. Employees who work in an office with other staff members have staggered shifts to reduce contact. The district also has put out social distancing guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“All of those things have been in place,” Ms. Vitale said.&nbsp;“So we are ready to move to the next step and that is bringing children in.”</p>
<p>The district plans to welcome students — the first wave being those with special needs — as early as July 6, according to Ms. Vitale. She said the district is thinking about reopening the week of July 6 instead of July 1 because of the Independence Day holiday.</p>
<p>Ms. Vitale said the district was aiming to begin school sports programs on July 6 as well. The state recently gave permission for schools in yellow and green phase counties to start sports activities when districts approve a safety plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even at schools that have no plans for students to return during the summer, signs are appearing that there is progress toward reopening.</p>
<p>In the Woodland Hills School District, Superintendent James Harris said construction at the high school and one of the middle schools is further preventing a return. But he said he is hoping to get teachers back in their buildings as soon as Aug. 2.</p>
<p>“Once the buildings are cleaned, they can come back and start doing things,” Mr. Harris said.</p>
