<h1>Mark Cuban thinks Kanye West is a 'more appealing' presidential candidate than Trump</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If Kanye West is serious about running for president in this year’s election, Mark Cuban thinks he would get more votes than President Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Cuban, a Mt. Lebanon native and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, on Saturday told a journalist via Twitter that if there were Rank Choice voting available on November’s ballot, he could see Mr. West ranking ahead of Mr. Trump — and below the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The discussion came after rapper and entertainer <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/07/05/Kanye-West-2020-president-campaign-Donald-Trump-Kim-Kardashian-Twitter-tweet-social-media/stories/202007050139" target="_blank">Mr. West tweeted that he was running for president</a>, a notion that sent social media into a frenzy on the Fourth of July.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Cuban was asked if he supported Mr. West’s bid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;“Shark Tank” star later went on to say that he believes Mr. West is&nbsp;“more appealing” than Mr. Trump and would therefore take votes away from him if he ran as an independent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Logic dictates that he takes votes from the least appealing candidate,” Mr. Cuban said, adding that Mr. West would help Mr. Biden secure a victory.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuban also mentioned that he funds the Center for Competitive Democracy, a non-profit organization that he said could potentially help Mr. West get on the ballot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There isn't going to be a real poll that includes Kanye,” he said. “I don't see how he can even make it on enough ballots to be considered for polling. I fund a group&nbsp;@voterchoice&nbsp;that sues to get independent/3rd party candidates on the ballot. If&nbsp;@kanyewest&nbsp;wants help, we can help him.”</p>
<p>Mr. Cuban clarified that he doesn’t plan on helping the musician’s campaign with funding, but that if Mr. West was denied access to the ballot, he would refer him to the nonprofit.</p>
<p>It has yet to be confirmed if Mr. West was serious about starting a presidential campaign four months before the election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He would still need to qualify for ballot access across 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, Mr. West hadn’t filed forms with the Federal Election Commission to run for office, according to a Bloomberg review of FEC data.</p>
