<h1>Obituary: Jean Fink | She loved the kids -- and fought for them</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A member of the Pittsburgh Public Schools board for more than three decades and a lifelong advocate for neighborhood schools, Jean Fink took on the unpaid —&nbsp;and largely thankless —&nbsp;job for the love of children.</p>
<p>“I made some good decisions. I probably made some bad decisions, but I always did it because I really ... love the kids. I love the school system,” Mrs. Fink said at her last board meeting in November 2013.</p>
<p>“Jean was a wonderful person and a very honest person who would do anything for her district and the city,” said her friend and former school board colleague Darlene Harris. “Whatever she could do to help somebody, she was there.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Fink, 75, of Carrick, died of heart failure on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Her tenure on the school board was all the more remarkable because Mrs. Fink, nee Neuman, quit South Hills High School in 11th grade to marry her sweetheart, Fred W. Fink Jr.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fink married in June 1962. Mr. Fink died in 2007.</p>
<p>“I think she fell in love with the Harley first,” said her daughter Joanne Einloth, of Carrick, laughing at the memory of her parents astride her father’s Harley-Davidson motorcycles over the years. “When she met my dad she was done with school. She wanted to get married and have kids, but you would have never known that she didn’t finish high school or go to college by talking to her. She was very smart.”</p>
<p>After her fourth child was born, the 22-year-old Mrs. Fink obtained her GED.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fink became active in her community as a volunteer at the non-profit Carrick Community Council and as one of the founders of the annual Halloween parade and Corn Fest in Carrick.</p>
<p>When her children were growing up, Mrs. Fink spent countless hours behind the concession stand at Volunteers Park.</p>
<p>“She got all of us kids into sports and every mom had to do their duty at the concession stand. Between all of us, I think she was there 12 years,” her daughter said. “She was very, very involved in the community. It seemed like every little thing that went on, she knew about it or organized it.”</p>
<p>A talented seamstress and thrifty economizer, Mrs. Fink knew how to stretch a buck —&nbsp;an essential skill for a mother of six.</p>
<p>“Mom made a lot of our clothes,” her daughter said. “She even made us winter coats one year. She sewed wedding and prom dresses and costumes. And she took over our yard with her beautiful garden. She would can everything so we could eat all winter. She made pickles and sauerkraut and spent two days every year canning tomatoes. She even grew the dill for the pickles.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Fink employed her baking and cooking skills as a caterer for family and friends, once catering a wedding with 250 guests.</p>
<p>As a member of the Overbrook Elementary School PTA, Mrs. Fink worried about students safely crossing busy Route 51 on their way to and from school.</p>
<p>“She and other parents made a human chain across Rt. 51” to get the attention of local officials, her daughter said.</p>
<p>She lobbied the school board for help and in 1972 convinced them to visit the school and walk the same route as the kids did. Improvements were made.</p>
<p>By 1976, she was among the first group of PPS board members to be elected rather than appointed to the school board. She served continuously until her retirement in 2013, except for the years between 1993 and 1997 —&nbsp;the only time she lost reelection.</p>
<p>“She wanted an elected school board and fought for it and got it,” her daughter said.</p>
<p>But, the road wasn’t always easy.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, she supported integration but not the forced busing of students, and anytime a neighborhood school closed, she took it to heart.</p>
<p>“I believe in neighborhood schools, period, not just in my neighborhood,” she said in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in December 2001.</p>
<p>But the job could be frustrating over her 33 years on the board, including two years as president.</p>
<p>There was the time she got into a red-faced shouting match with former Superintendent John Thompson in a stairwell, or when she was overheard threatening to dump water onto the head of fellow board member Randall Taylor to get his attention —&nbsp;though Mr. Taylor was quick to forgive the remark and later said he remembered it “fondly,” as a time when board members debated and fought for issues important to them.</p>
<p>“She was a great person and a great advocate,” recalled Ms. Harris, who later went on to be elected to Pittsburgh City Council. “I can’t tell you how much fun she was.”</p>
<p>The two traveled to conferences together and even spent weekend mornings poring over budget figures to find funding to keep neighborhood schools open in 2000 as part of an initiative they called the “Housewife's Special.”</p>
<p>“We were calling department heads and directors, asking them what they could live without and we came up with $35 million,” she said. “A couple of board members thought it was just ridiculous, but they had no idea how much time we spent on it.”</p>
<p>“She would go out for meetings that lasted anywhere from one hour to six hours and she still came home and made dinner and made sure the house was running,” her daughter said. “She was amazing.”</p>
<p>A good example of her mother’s devotion came during the first month of the school year when she inevitably would be slammed with endless calls from angry parents over transportation problems, her daughter said.</p>
<p>“The phone would be ringing constantly and every call was about a bus,” she said. “She would work to help reorganize and reroute schedules. Not everybody liked her, but she handled everything with grace. She would have done anything for the district and for the kids.”</p>
<p>In more recent years, Mrs. Fink was devoted to her grandchildren and loved living with her son Fred “Buddy” Fink III and his wife Debbie, where she was treated like a member of the royal family, her daughter said.</p>
<p>Two of her granddaughters found a special way to memorialize Mrs. Fink, who had a longstanding practice of sending birthday cards with money and a lottery ticket inside.</p>
<p>“She always signed everything with ‘Love, Gram,’ so they got that tattooed on their hands,” her daughter said. “She was just a very giving person and we will miss her.”</p>
<p>Along with her daughter and son, Mrs. Fink is survived by her other children Susan Scherba, of Baldwin; Peggy Tice, of Carrick; Michael Fink, of Carrick; 9 grandchildren; and 6 great-grandchildren. She was preceded in death by her son Matthew Fink.</p>
<p>Her funeral was Saturday.</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Animal Rescue League at 6926 Hamilton Ave., Pittsburgh, PA 15208 or humaneanimalrescue.org.</p>
