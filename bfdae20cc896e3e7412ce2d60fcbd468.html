<h1>From virtual home remodeling tools to fighting for dry cleaning, businesses adjust to Gov. Wolf's orders</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Christine Solanina, who owns and operates a laundromat and dry cleaning service in Ross, is taking some credit for shaping how the state has handled its response to the spread of the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>After Gov. Tom Wolf issued a new mandate ordering all “non-life-sustaining” businesses to close last Thursday, Ms. Solanina spent countless hours on the phone trying to get more clarification about the order and determine how to keep her doors open.</p>
<p>“There are so many people that do not have the availability of washer and dryers, so what are you going to do? If everybody is in fact sick, you need to clean stuff to maintain good health,” Ms. Solanina said.</p>
<p>Hallmark Cleaners serves many health care workers, said Ms. Solanina’s daughter Mauresa. After learning they might have to close, one customer told the family she would have to start washing her clothes in her tub.</p>
<p>By Friday, the governor had issued new guidance for which businesses were permitted to stay open and had reclassified dry cleaning and laundry services as life-sustaining.</p>
<p>That same day, the Wolf administration announced it was pushing back enforcement of the order from Saturday morning to Monday, in part because of the high volume of questions and concerns from businesses like Hallmark Cleaners.</p>
<p>Gov. Wolf isn’t “really getting the whole scope of it,” Ms. Solanina said. “He’s not being affected at all by this, financially … I have friends that are self-employed. It’s terrifying.</p>
<p>“Am I really breaking even by staying open? I won’t be able to determine that for a while yet. But, am I making money? No. I’m providing a service for a community.”</p>
<p>As of Monday, the state had received around 10,000 requests from businesses that felt they should be permitted to stay open, despite a “non-life-sustaining” classification, according to David Taylor, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association.</p>
<p>To qualify to remain open, businesses had to fill out a waiver application that asked each company to define how it met the life-sustaining definition, if it had a plan to meet federal guidelines to maintain employee safety and how many employees would be in the company’s physical location.</p>
<p>While they waited to hear from the state to see if they qualified for exemption, they were instructed to suspend all in-person, physical operations.</p>
<p><strong>Determining the supply chain</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers, through their trade associations, have sought blanket exemptions from shutdown orders.</p>
<p>“All manufacturers should be deemed ‘essential’ in the fight against #COVID19,” Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers wrote to Mr. Wolf.</p>
<p>"Our manufacturing sector is enormous and it is sprawling, and no one can know exactly what goes into everybody’s supply chain," said David Taylor, president &amp; CEO of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association.</p>
<p>He gave one example of a Pennsylvania pallet manufacturer — part of the wood manufacturing sector that is considered not life-sustaining except for the fact that its largest customer is bleach maker Clorox.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gun shop that challenged Mr. Wolf’s authority to shutter businesses determined to be non-life-sustaining, paving the way for enforcement to begin.</p>
<p>Businesses can be fined more than $300 if found in violation of the order, which is slated to be enforced by police officers in the state.</p>
<p>The state has made some shifts. Among others, the state has decided to permit Riverstone Books in McCandless to continue taking phone orders, curbside and home deliveries.</p>
<p>It also reversed course on its original decision to close law offices. Now, lawyers are permitted to work from their physical locations to perform duties deemed essential by county or federal judges.</p>
<p><strong>Taking cues from customers</strong></p>
<p>Since the shutdown order was announced, both the companies impacted by it and the state’s Department of Community and Economic Development have been volleying details around the clock.</p>
<p>Frank Elling, president of Quintech Electronics &amp; Communications Inc. in Indiana, Pa., pulled up the online exemption application at 6 a.m. on Saturday morning. Mr. Elling explained that his firm designs satellite equipment, much of it for federal defense contractors.</p>
<p>The next day, “out of the blue,” Quintech received letters from Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and OshKosh Corp.</p>
<p>“They said our products are essential, critical infrastructure,” Mr. Elling recalled. He forwarded the letters to the state.</p>
<p>At 12:58 a.m. on Monday, the DCED sent its decision that Quintech was considered essential.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Paul Sirney’s inbox got notice from DCED that his company’s request for a waiver had been denied.</p>
<p>Mr. Sirney, CEO of Accrotool Inc., a contract metal manufacturer in New Kensington, applied for the exemption request “just to have that in our pocket.”</p>
<p>Some of his biggest clients are defense contractors. Critically, Accrotool also makes components for medical equipment used to test for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Despite the DCED’s ruling, Accrotool will reopen on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Federal orders take priority over what Gov. Wolf is doing,” Mr. Sirney said. He has been told so by his customers, he said.</p>
<p>Accrotool has given its 111 employees the option of staying home if they want. Some have chosen to do so, Mr. Sirney said. The others will be back in the 80,000-square-foot building with plenty of room for social distancing, he said.</p>
<p><strong>A digital switch</strong></p>
<p>Legacy Remodeling, a home improvement company in Dormont, said it is still allowed to operate under the governor’s order because it retails building materials, but it may be limited to emergency repair work.</p>
<p>That can be a tricky shift on such short notice, especially when the company is halfway through remodeling a kitchen for someone who is now ordered to stay at home and prepare most of their meals themselves, said Jeff Moeslein, president and owner of Legacy Remodeling.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to start a new kitchen but if we’re halfway through your kitchen and you’d really like your kitchen back, we’re going to come and work,” Mr. Moeslein said. “We’ve got some [projects] that honestly are like a gray area. Until the government tells me I’m doing wrong, I’m just going to keep doing it.”</p>
<p>Already, Mr. Moeslein has set himself a goal of trying to save at least 20-30% of the business that his company would normally get this spring.</p>
<p>One way to do that: switch to virtual remodels.</p>
<p>Using a combination of video conferencing tools, cell phone pictures, software and algorithms, Legacy Remodeling is offering an entirely virtual consultation so it can line up new projects while still maintaining proper social distancing.</p>
<p>But it’s still unclear when those projects could actually get started.</p>
<p>“We’re playing it by ear with the government,” Mr. Moeslein said. “We are trying to stay open and active to the greatest degree we can without flouting the things that our government officials are asking.</p>
<p>“Sooner or later this this is going to be over,” he said. “I think it’s incumbent on the businesses to do what they can to try to keep themselves intact so they come out on the other end.”</p>
