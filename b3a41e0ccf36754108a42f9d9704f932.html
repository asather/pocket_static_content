<h1>Pitt's spring game, other athletic events proceeding as normal amid COVID-19 concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt's home athletic events, including the Blue-Gold spring football game on April 11, will proceed "as previously scheduled" despite the university taking precautionary measures against the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The university announced Wednesday afternoon that it will transition to "distance learning," beginning Monday, March 23, in response to the novel coronavirus. However, Pitt athletics "may continue its practice and competition regimen," according to a university statement.</p>

<p>A Pitt spokesperson also told the Post-Gazette that attendance at home athletic events will not be restricted in any way at this juncture.</p>
<p>Pitt has yet to announce if tickets to the spring game at Heinz Field will be free. But at this point, fans will not be barred from viewing the Panthers' scrimmage, the 15th and final practice of camp. The game, which kicks off at 5 p.m., will also air nationally on ACC Network.</p>
<p>The football team is currently off with the university on spring break but will resume its practice schedule on Tuesday morning at its South Side facility, as previously scheduled.</p>
<p>Pitt does not have a home athletic event until Friday. The Panthers' baseball team hosts Virginia at 3 p.m. at Charles L. Cost Field.</p>
