<h1>West Virginia — only state without confirmed COVID-19 case — declares emergency</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The governor of the only U.S. state without a confirmed case of the new coronavirus declared a state of emergency Monday so certain rules on personnel and purchasing could be waived.</p>
<p>West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said that he doesn’t want the state to be “asleep at the switch” because it hasn’t had a positive test.</p>
<p>Justice has repeatedly said the virus is likely in the state but is undetected because of a national lack of testing.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen Joe Manchin, a Democrat, echoed concerns about the small amount of available testing.</p>
<p>“If it gets a hold of our state, we don’t have the health care in order to defend ourselves. It could be devastating,” he said in a conference call.</p>
<p>About 20% of West Virginia’s population is over age 65, one of the highest rates in the nation.</p>
<p>According to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources website, offices of the DHHR have conducted 39 tests for the virus. All but one of these tests, which is still pending at this time, have come back negative.</p>
<p>According to the DHHR website, the virus is spread through direct person-to-person contact, contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or touching a contaminated surface.</p>
