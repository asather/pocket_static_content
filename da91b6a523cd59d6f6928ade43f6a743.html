<h1>J.C. Penney decides not to close stores in Monroeville, Beaver Valley malls</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>J.C. Penney, the bankrupt department store chain, has reversed its decision to close two Pittsburgh-area stores.</p>
<p>The locations at Monroeville Mall and Beaver Valley Mall have been removed from a list of impending store closures. That list still includes the J.C. Penney stores at Clearview Mall in Butler and at the Galleria at Pittsburgh Mills.</p>
<p>Alan Flummer, general manager of the Beaver Valley store, learned the news around 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday. He was supposed to hold off on telling anyone until the official notice came, but he couldn’t help it. Mr. Flummer told a merchandise manager working the evening shift and she, in turn, ran down the escalator yelling: “We’re not closing! We’re not closing!”</p>
<p>The news spared the jobs of around 100 employees who had been overseeing a liquidation sale beginning in mid-June and scheduled to culminate in the store’s closure at the end of September.</p>
<p>The Sephora makeup section inside has been tarped off since then. Signs throughout the store announced that all sales were final. There was a rush on Stafford brand underwear, emptying out even the crates in the back.</p>
<p>“Obviously, they were getting ready to never buy underwear again,” Mr. Flummer said.</p>
<p>To him, it was a sign of how much customer loyalty had been accumulated over the store’s six decades in Beaver County.</p>
<p>The J.C. Penney at Beaver Valley Mall had relocated from its a previous location in Baden, which opened in 1957. Some of the original Baden employees are still among the ranks.</p>
<p>A sales associate in lingerie has been there for 37 years. A hair stylist for 30. And just a few weeks ago, Mr. Flummer made a new hire&nbsp;— the formerly retired general manager of the old Monroeville J.C. Penney who hired Mr. Flummer to his first job with the company.</p>
<p>He was intending to stock shelves until the end of September. But now his plans have changed as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Flummer said he wasn’t told why the company reversed its decision. J.C. Penney spokeswoman Dione Martin declined to elaborate on the chain’s rationale, saying it was the result of “comprehensive evaluations of our retail footprint and a careful analysis of store performance and future strategic fit for JCPenney.”</p>
<p>“All that we really knew is that they were still working with a lot of landlords,” Mr. Flummer said.</p>
<p>As soon as the news came, the general manager was rearranging the pieces in his head. He’d have to get back some of the merchandise that had been sent out to other stores. He’d have to figure out if returns of items bought during the liquidation period would now be possible. Will the Sephora be reopened? “Stay tuned,” he said.</p>
<p>About 85 employees work at the Monroeville J.C. Penney location, its general manager told WTAE on Friday. The manager was not available for comment on Saturday.</p>
<p>The century-old Texas-based chain filed for bankruptcy protection in May, in part due to the disruption in retail associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. But its financial woes preceded the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>The two locations recently spared from closing were part of 154 stores across the country that J.C. Penney planned to close as part of its restructuring.</p>
