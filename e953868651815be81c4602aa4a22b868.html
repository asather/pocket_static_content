<h1>A bad balance: Credit card debt is on the rise</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The federal government, which owes more than $23 trillion, isn’t alone in having a debt problem that’s growing.</p>
<p>A recent study by CompareCards found that Americans’ credit card and other types of revolving debt — spending power borrowed against a credit line, often at variable interest rates — has jumped nearly 20% from a decade ago. It totals about $1.1 trillion, an all-time high, with the average American’s credit card balance at nearly $6,200.</p>
<p>And many are not paying off their balances.</p>
<p>According to the CompareCards study, only 30% of millennials with credit card debt paid off their balances last year compared with a better — but still surprisingly low — 43% of baby boomers.</p>
<p>A separate study by Freedom Debt Relief found that more than a quarter of those carrying balances blamed spending on groceries, with 20% citing retail expenses and 19% listing vacations. The vacation spending can be cut back, but if grocery purchases are driving their debt, that’s only going to lead to more trouble. The best way to stop falling behind on credit card debt is to cut spending. Interest rates on credit cards have been about 17%t so far this year, a level at which carrying a balance adds up.</p>
<p>Credit card companies are not free from blame, raising the average credit limit by 20% over the past decade to about $31,000.</p>
<p>The first step for consumers in getting a handle on debt is to make a budget to see where they are spending and where cuts can be made. They should see if they can transfer balances to a card with a lower interest rate. Then they can decide if they want the quick success of paying off the smallest credit card balances first, or, if they can, pay down the ones with the highest interest rates first.</p>
<p>One strategy millennials used during the Great Recession might also be advisable. Rely less, or not at all, on high-interest credit cards and instead put all spending on a debit card.</p>
<p>Carrying credit card balances during a booming economy is a sign that changes need to be made. The good times will not last forever and when they end, savings come in handy.</p>
