<h1>How bad can the economy get? Could this be another great Depression?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The breadlines that symbolized the worst of the Great Depression have been replaced in recent months with often desperate new lines of suddenly unemployed people — in cars — waiting hours to obtain donated food for the first time in their lives, unable to pay rent or their mortgage and living in a shared state of worry that Americans have not felt for close to a century.</p>
<p>The fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak is being compared to the most severe financial crisis in U.S. history because of the unprecedented shock to the job market and consumer spending.</p>
<p>But will this turn into a depression? And how will we know if we’ve tipped from a recession into a depression?</p>
<p>Risa Kumazawa, associate professor of economics at Duquesne University, is convinced the answer to the first question is yes. “Since the beginning of the coronavirus, I have continually forecasted a depression because this is a health threat that directly impacts the labor market,” she said.</p>
<p>There is general agreement that the U.S. economy is already in recession, defined as a period when the nation’s gross domestic product contracts for at least two quarters, according to online financial site Investopedia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Great Depression of the 1930s was defined not as much by the scale of the economic decline, but for how long it lasted. Another camp of economists believe it’s premature to talk about what is happening now as a depression, however it is defined.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it will be a depression because I don’t expect it to last very long,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank.</p>
<p>“I expect that the economic contraction will end sometime in the summer of 2020, as restrictions on movement are gradually lifted. So it will only last around 4 or 5 months.”</p>
<p>The Great Depression officially lasted for almost four years — August 1929 to March 1933.</p>
<p>The Great Recession officially lasted 1½&nbsp;years — from December 2007 to June 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>
<p>During the early 1930s, the nation’s unemployment rate peaked at 24.9% and the country’s gross domestic product fell 26.7% from the peak to the trough of the business cycle. GDP is the sum total of all goods and services produced by a country in a specific time frame.</p>
<p>Numbers being tossed around for 2020 look pretty bad, too.</p>
<p>PNC Financial Services Group is forecasting a 30.2% annualized decline in the nation’s gross domestic product for the second quarter. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will release the official figures in July.</p>
<p>In April, the national unemployment rate spiked to 14.7% — a massive surge from the 3.5% unemployment rate seen in February as businesses across the country were forced to close to fight the spread of COVID-19 and laid off workers they could no longer afford to employ.</p>
<p>“Despite states opening up their economies, the unemployment rate for May 2020 is projected to surpass 20% as we continue to grapple with a pandemic without a vaccine in sight,” Ms. Kumazawa said.</p>
<p>While jobs numbers have declined in all industries, she noted that the leisure and hospitality sector — which would include hotels, restaurants and theaters — was hit the hardest, followed by education and health services, professional and business services, and retail trade.</p>
<p>“These numbers indicate that the job losses are more widespread than in typical recessions in which manufacturing and construction are the most affected,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions better now</strong></p>
<p>While the economic data may be bad as the Great Depression, the conditions that people experience likely won’t be.</p>
<p>Americans have safety nets this time. Federal lawmakers in the 1930s responded to the deprivation and despair of that experience by establishing Social Security and unemployment safety nets that exist today.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, lawmakers have been looking at economists’ latest projections as they push out stimulus packages to head off the prospect of a downturn that drags on and becomes a depression. Congress has already approved some $2.4 trillion to combat the coronavirus crisis and the resulting financial fallout. Another $3 trillion package is under discussion.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean it won’t be painful, with millions of people struggling to put food on the table and businesses tipping into bankruptcy as sales dry up or nervous lenders pull back on critical loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of economists surveyed recently by the New York-based Blue Chips Economic Indicators, which generates a monthly report tracking business economists’ views on issues like inflation and interest rates, expect the 2020 downturn to be the deepest U.S. recession of our generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the group is not actually calling for another depression, seeing potential for the economy to turn around before it hits that point.</p>
<p>Gerald Cohen, a senior economist at Blue Chips Economic Indicators, said the monthly survey found the economists polled expect the unemployment rate to peak at 17.8%, but the rebound to be relatively modest.</p>
<p>“Our growth curve shows the economy will not return to its 2019 peak until the end of 2021 or later,” Mr. Cohen said.</p>
<p>Mr. Faucher at PNC Bank is calling the current economic downturn the “Viral Recession.” He expects the nation’s recovery from it on the charts to look more like a checkmark than a U-shape or V-shape.</p>
<p>“We’ll experience a deep recession and a solid recovery, but it will take a year or two to fully recover,” he said.</p>
<p>A key factor is that the current recession is being led by a very steep decline in consumer spending — which accounts for about two-thirds of the U.S. economy — caused by restrictions in people’s movements, Mr. Faucher said. Once the limitations are lifted, he expects consumer spending and GDP will start to recover.</p>
<p>Economists look at whether people are confident enough to make big purchases like cars, houses and vacations.</p>
<p>“Once consumers have the ability to spend, they will start spending again,” Mr. Faucher predicted.</p>
<p>Of course, unemployment numbers this high can freeze workers in place, making it hard to find new jobs to replace the ones that have evaporated. Many will be hanging in there hoping that their employer will ramp back up.</p>
<p>Total nationwide job losses have reached 36.5 million since the onset of coronavirus lockdowns, About 75,557 Pennsylvanians filed new claims in the week ending May 9 after losing their jobs or getting hours reduced, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>
<p>The numbers of new claims in Pennsylvania has been subsiding from late March peaks, but still remain very high: More than 1.8 million have filed claims, or 28% of the workforce.</p>
<p><strong>History repeating?</strong></p>
<p>The Pittsburgh region has seen its share of localized financial disasters over the years that some argue have hit just as hard.</p>
<p>Unemployment here reached its peak in early 1983 at 18%, according to Chris Briem, a regional economist at the University of Pittsburgh. He said some communities and some counties were hit even harder than average. Beaver County peaked at 28% unemployment, which is a rate that many states did not reach during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>“For Pittsburgh, the question may be better asked how will the coming years compare to the region’s experience in the 1980s, not the 1930s,” Mr. Briem said.</p>
<p>“The Pittsburgh region sustained over 10% unemployment for nearly three straight years in the 1980s,” he said. “One could argue there was never any economic rebound, and certainly not a V-shaped rebound to date for most of the communities in the Mon Valley.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s unemployment rate in March was 6%, the latest data available. At that point, Fayette County had the highest unemployment rate in the region at 9.3%, followed by Armstrong County at 8.3%, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor &amp; Industry.</p>
