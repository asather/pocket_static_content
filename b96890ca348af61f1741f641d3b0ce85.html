<h1>Several churches signal plans to reopen</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A group of Pittsburgh-area churches, including several large evangelical and Pentecostal congregations, have signed a letter signaling their intent to open in the coming weeks and encouraging other churches to do so prudently and safely.</p>
<p>“It is time for the churches of Southwestern Pennsylvania to reopen their doors for public ministry!” says the letter, signed by an initial group of pastors from 14 churches, many of them non-denominational, with more expected to sign on.</p>
<p>Some plan to open as early as Sunday, others in the coming weeks. The pastors said churches should continue to maintain the livestreaming and other online services they have been providing since churches largely closed their doors in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling those who can’t or don’t want to gather in groups to continue to worship at home.</p>
<p>The statement comes after several Eastern Orthodox churches have resumed public worship, and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh plans to resume public Masses on June 1.</p>
<p>Lead Pastor Jason Howard of Amplify Church, who helped organize the letter, said the pastors he’s spoken with intend to heed recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including encouraging worshipers to wear mask, spacing out the seating, having surfaces thoroughly cleaned and placing sanitizer stations throughout the buildings.</p>
<p>"Even though churches were designated as ‘essential services’&nbsp;by state government officials, virtually all of them have voluntarily closed their doors in the interest of public health and safety from COVID-19,” says the letter, whose signers include pastors from large congregations such as Covenant Church of Pittsburgh, Allison Park Church and Victory Family Church.</p>
<p>“Now, it is clear from most recent health data that we are seeing a rapid decline in cases and loss of life in our area with virtually no deaths reported under the age of 30 according to CDC and the Commonwealth of PA statistics,” the letter said. “This could change, however, and we will continue to monitor public health data and respond accordingly.”</p>
<p>The letter noted that each church will decide when to reopen on its own timetable. “We didn’t want to get too prescriptive, because different churches will make different decisions based on their demographics and needs,” Pastor Howard said.&nbsp;“It’s our attempt to have a unified voice. We believe we can do this is in a way that protects people’s safety, and we believe that it is necessary for us to gather together again.”</p>
<p>Among those opening this Sunday is Covenant Church of Pittsburgh, located in Wilkinsburg.</p>
<p>“We have been honoring the closings and probably honoring them even when it wasn’t required of us to do so,” said Bishop Joseph Garlington.&nbsp;“There’s a point at which we felt we have accomplished a lot of what they wanted accomplished.”</p>
<p>He said meeting in person on Pentecost, the anniversary of the founding of the Christian Church in the biblical Book of Acts, is significant.</p>
<p>“It’s almost like a second birth,” Bishop Garlington said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Gathering is a key piece in the Christian church,” he added. “We don't see it as a luxury. We see it as an essential.”</p>
<p>The church is having a deep-cleaning of its building. Seating will be spaced apart, sanitizer stations will be available, and all staff and ushers will be wearing masks other than the singers and speakers on stage. The church is urging anyone with symptoms to stay home, and greeters will be using no-touch thermometers for those arriving. Those with a fever will receive a prayer and be asked to go home, said the church’s guidelines.</p>
<p>Pastor Howard, while not announcing reopening dates yet for Amplify’s three Allegheny County campuses, said that gathering in person is important to help those vulnerable to isolation, such as those with depression or addictions.</p>
<p>“We have an opportunity to help those people, and we have a responsibility to help those people,” he said.</p>
<p>And he said by taking precautions, churches can reassure their neighbors they are being rigorous in their efforts to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Nate Wardle, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, noted that religious institutions have been&nbsp;exempted from the governor’s stay-at-home orders, although most have voluntarily shut down. He urged those reopening to limit crowd sizes and take other precautions.</p>
<p>“For enclosed spaces, it is very important for people to continue to wear a mask and to practice social distancing,” he said. “Some of the typical parts of a church service could put people at risk, such as passing communion and/or offering plates, taking communion as is customary with tearing off bread and drinking from one chalice, etc. Also, when one is singing, there is the potential that droplets could travel further than the customary six feet.”</p>
