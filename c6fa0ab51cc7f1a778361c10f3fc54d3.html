<h1>‘Elite tower in the sky’: Concerns raised about design of proposed 21-story office building in Strip</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A whopper of an office tower is getting ready to rise in the Strip District. But not everybody is happy with what they’re seeing.</p>
<p>New York developer JMC Holdings pitched its proposal to erect a 21-story office and commercial tower at 1501 Penn Ave. to Pittsburgh Planning Commission members Tuesday.</p>
<p>Though described as “well-mannered” and “quietly elegant,” the building would dwarf all others in the Strip, leading some commissioners to question aspects of the design, particularly for a structure seen as a bridge between the neighborhood and Downtown.</p>
<p>“This is a transition building. It needs to make that kind of statement. I think we’re probably all mildly disappointed in some of the things we’re seeing,” Commissioner Sabina Deitrick said.</p>
<p>During a lengthy briefing, others questioned the vibe of the street-level retail and public space, with one suggesting that more needs to be done to capture the feel of the iconic Penn Avenue corridor stuffed with shops, restaurants and generations-old merchants just blocks away.</p>
<p>“When you’ve spent time with the guy selling Steelers gear on the sidewalk, you recognize that some of the magic of that is in the kind of ability of people to put something on the sidewalk. It is the honky tonk, it is the chaos that is there that is part of it,” commission Chairwoman Christine Mondor said.</p>
<p>“The language of this proposal is not that. The language is a tower, an elite tower in the sky.”</p>
<p>Ms. Mondor suggested that more should be done to appeal to the “kinds of folks who are visiting the Strip District.” The renderings, she said, represent “a kind of international ideal of who occupies these buildings and who occupies our cities.”</p>
<p>JMC is proposing to build the glass and steel tower, one that would rise more than 10 stories above the next tallest in the Strip, at the site of the former New Federal Cold Storage warehouse, the one with the giant smiling fish sign on one side.</p>
<p>The developer intends to demolish the 336,000-square-foot bunker-like concrete structure to clear the way for the project, although it plans to keep the old seven-story building’s foundation.</p>
<p>Built in place of the warehouse would be a tower featuring some 520,000 square feet of office space spread over 12 floors, one floor of amenities, seven floors of parking with 846 spaces and first-floor retail space on Smallman Street and Penn.</p>
<p>In discussing the design, architect Brandon Haw said the goal was to erect a building that would serve as a connection between Downtown, with its towering skyscrapers, and the Strip, with many low-slung structures.</p>
<p>It’s meant to be an “elegant neighbor ... that will stand the test of time.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t need to shout from the rooftops. It needs to be an elegant and humble and sober design in our view that will become a timeless classic over the course of history,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Haw added that the structure also is meant to complement the redevelopment taking place around it, including the nearby produce terminal.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is designed to take into account the needs of modern office tenants, with wellness features, adaptable floor plates and other amenities, he stressed.</p>
<p>“It isn’t a building that is somehow going to be a flight of fashion with bells and whistles and lots of things attached to it,” he said. “It’s a building that is designed to be quietly elegant and a good neighbor. It’s well-mannered.”</p>
<p>Maybe too well-mannered, Ms. Mondor implied. She said the upper floors of the structure seem to lack a sense of place.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how we can fix that. I don’t know how we can change that. It’s not a critique of the design as much as it is a, you know, I wish the building could try harder,” she said.</p>
<p>Beyond Ms. Mondor’s concerns about the street-level vibe on Penn, the other issue was the way much of the public open space was designed with a colonnade along Smallman that will be open to the public.</p>
<p>Some members thought the colonnade, to be filled with seating and landscaping, may have too much of a private feel. That could prevent the public from using it. City planning staffers had the same concerns and questioned whether it counts against public open space requirements.</p>
<p>Mr. Haw disagreed with such interpretations.</p>
<p>“If you go to any great city ... the idea of a colonnade is public space. The colonnades protect people from the sun. They protect people from the rain. They keep people away from icy sidewalks,” he said.</p>
<p>“Colonnades throughout the history of urbanism have been used, from the ancient Greeks onwards, as public space. It’s where you gather. It’s where you have cafe seating. It’s where you have public seating.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Mr. Haw said he and the developer are willing to work with the city to ensure the space is welcoming to members of the public.</p>
<p>Planning commission members are not the only ones who have raised questions about the building’s design. Mayor Bill Peduto has said the building’s massive size doesn’t fit the character of the Strip. He urged JMC to reconsider the size.</p>
<p>In light of COVID-19, the new tower will be equipped with a multitude of touchless features and other measures to prevent the spread of the virus. It also will have large open-floor plates, roof gardens and a “bike cafe” on Penn.</p>
