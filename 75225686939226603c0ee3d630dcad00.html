<p>HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday announced that 24 northwest and north-central Pennsylvania counties <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/05/pennsylvania-counties-reopen-full-list-may-8/" target="_blank">will be allowed to reopen in a limited fashion</a> beginning May 8, the first step toward unwinding the stringent COVID-19 restrictions in place across the state.</p>
<p>These counties — Bradford, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lycoming, McKean, Mercer, Montour, Northumberland, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, Union, Venango, and Warren — will enter the “yellow” phase of Mr. Wolf’s tiered reopening.</p>

<p>Here’s what you can expect each step of the way:</p>
<p>This is the most stringent phase and has been in place for all Pennsylvania counties since <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/04/pennsylvania-pa-coronavirus-stay-at-home-order-statewide-tom-wolf/" target="_blank">a statewide stay-at-home order</a> was issued April 1.</p>
<p><strong>Workplace restrictions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Social restrictions</strong></p>
<p>In this phase, state officials will ease some restrictions and allow more businesses to open, but customers can still expect mitigation efforts such as curbside pickup/delivery only and potential limitations on the number of people allowed in store. Closures of schools, gyms, and other indoor recreation centers, hair and nail salons, as well as limitations around large gatherings, remain in place.</p>
<p><strong>Workplace restrictions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Social restrictions</strong></p>
<p>This phase removes all restrictions placed upon business operations and social guidelines, though safety guidelines implemented by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state Department of Health must be followed. This phase is considered the “new normal.”</p>
