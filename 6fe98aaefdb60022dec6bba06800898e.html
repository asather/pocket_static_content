<h1>Pitt walk-on guard Anthony Starzynski made the most of his senior night</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There was little for which Pitt fans had to cheer Wednesday night, particularly in the final minutes of the Panthers’ 72-49 loss to Syracuse.</p>
<p>A team that had lost four straight and needed to generate some sort of positive momentum was not only defeated, but routed. For the second time in its past three home games, Pitt lost by 20 points or more. With as many as 12 minutes left, and the Panthers trailing by 25, some groups of fans began filing out of Petersen Events Center. They had seen enough.</p>
<p>But with 5:57 to play and the game long ago decided, with the Orange up by 22, those that remained inside the arena clapped their hands together, some rising to their feet. Nothing momentous had occurred that would make fans think that somehow Pitt might find its way back in the game. Something else, however, was taking place — Anthony Starzynski was checking out of the game.</p>
<p>Given the night that he had and all that had led him to that night, it was a worthy ovation.</p>
<p>On the Panthers’ senior night, Starzynski, a senior walk-on and Baldwin graduate, got more than what a celebratory occasion typically offers. He not only got to start the game, along with fellow senior-night honorees Eric Hamilton and Samson George, but he logged a career-high 11 minutes, surpassing his combined total from the previous five games in which he had appeared this season. In those minutes, he scored three points, matching a career high.</p>
<p>Starzynski, like many of his coaches and teammates, was disappointed with the loss and the fashion in which it came. But the night, while coming without a victory, provided him with something else.</p>
<p>“It was exciting to say the least,” Starzynski said after the game “I wasn't expecting it, to be honest. I'm just more than appreciative to coach Capel and his staff for giving me the opportunity and having the confidence in me to get in there and get a little bit more burn tonight than usual. I wish I could've knocked down a couple more shots. But that's just the way the game goes sometimes.”</p>
<p>Coach Jeff Capel had informed Starzynski, as well as Hamilton and George, that they would be starting in the team’s shootaround earlier that day. It’s a gesture that, while magnanimous, isn’t entirely uncommon. At the first stoppage in play just 1:14 into the contest, Starzynski, George and Hamilton were checked out of the game. It was, at least for the first two, seemingly the end of their night, the last chance they would walk off that court in that uniform.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the case for either, but especially not for Starzynski.</p>
<p>With 13:39 remaining in the game and the Panthers trailing by 19, 51-32, the 6-foot-3 guard was inserted back into the matchup. Lopsided as the game was, enough time remained that this wasn’t an instance of a coach waving the metaphorical white flag by inserting a walk-on. He proceeded to play about the next eight minutes, missing five of his six shots, all 3s, but shortly before he checked out of the game, he buried a 3 over the Orange’s 2-3 zone, prompting the crowd to get about as loud as it did the entire evening.</p>
<p>“After going through a season like they did — 0-18, a coaching change — those guys have had good attitudes, they’ve shown up to work every day and they’ve been really good teammates,” Capel said of Starzynski, as well as George and senior forward Kene Chukwuka, who has not played this season while recovering from offseason surgery. “I’m really, really grateful for it and I’m grateful that Anthony got the opportunity to not only start, but to come in and do some things in the game.”</p>
<p>Wednesday night was, as Capel alluded to, the culmination of an arduous three-year run for Starzynski and others around the Pitt program.</p>
<p>A two-time all-section selection at Baldwin who averaged 21 points per game as a senior, Starzynski joined the Panthers as a walk-on in 2017. The season that followed was perhaps the most inglorious in program history. Pitt went 8-24 and 0-19 in the ACC. Two days after the final one of those losses, coach Kevin Stallings was fired. Though Starzynski had little, if anything, to do with that given his limited playing time and role on the team, he and his teammates felt the full, agonizing brunt of that season — the demoralizing effect of loss after loss, the external scorn they faced and, perhaps worst of all, the questions and concerns about whether this situation could really ever get better.</p>
<p>While being a walk-on and the lack of expectations from fans that comes with that shielded him from some of the disdain, the life of a non-scholarship player is a famously strenuous one. Walk-ons put in many of the same hours and much of the same work their more well-known and accomplished teammates do, but without much of the payoff or whatever bits of fame and glory come with playing major college basketball.</p>
<p>For Starzynski, though, it was a role he accepted and enjoyed, difficult as it may have been at times. Even if Wednesday offered nothing more than a couple of gratuitous minutes, it wouldn’t have undone a three-year stretch he has come to cherish.</p>
<p>“It's not something I hate,” Starzynski said. “I like being around these guys, my teammates like Justin, X, Trey and 'Diese and the rest of the guys. I like being around the game and really good players to base my game off of to get more experience. And our coaches, as well, I love being around our coaches. Our coaches are some of the best in the league, some of the best in the NCAA for sure. And it's just been an awesome experience. It's been a whirlwind these past three years. Playing at this level and going to all the different schools and seeing our guys compete at this level has been an awesome experience.”</p>
