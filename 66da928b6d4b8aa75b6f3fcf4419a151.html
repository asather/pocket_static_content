<h1>Pirates showcase Adam Frazier with surprise shift to the outfield</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span>Adam Frazier has been playing some outfield this season, as the Pirates have occasionally relied on extreme shifts to deploy four defenders on the grass. But nothing like this.</span></p>
<p>As they started a four-game series in Milwaukee, Pirates manager Derek Shelton started Frazier in left field, the 2019 Gold Glove finalist at second base playing another position for the first time since 2018.</p>
<p><span>Frazier appeared in 35 games as an outfielder that year and in 67 the season before that, although he had settled into a routine at second base.</span></p>
<p>"I had watched video of him playing out there before," Shelton said. "He's good out there. He had played in this ballpark [Miller Park], which was different. I think we had said at one point that guys are going to play different spots, and after having a conversation with him and he was comfortable with it, we put him out there."</p>
<p><span>It's unlikely this will be a permanent thing, although it may be important for opposing teams looking at potentially adding Frazier by the trade deadline.</span></p>
<p>Although Frazier's offense has lacked in 2020 — he began Friday’s game with a slash line of .198/.234/.330 — it likely doesn’t hurt his stock to show that he can play multiple positions.</p>
<p><span>There’s been interest in Frazier dating back to MLB’s Winter Meetings. With several young infielders in their system, it would make sense for the Pirates to try and flip Frazier into a couple prospects by Monday’s deadline.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Bell on trade talk</span></strong></p>
<p>Cherington is on record saying that he would listen on anyone, that no Pirates player was off-limits. That would obviously include Bell, who will be become an unrestricted free agent after the 2022 season.</p>
<p>It likely doesn’t make sense to move Bell now, considering a slow start has probably dragged down his trade value, but that doesn’t stop the speculation that the Pirates could potentially look to trade Bell if they know they’re not going to sign him to an extension.</p>
<p>Bell addressed that topic Friday in a pregame Zoom call with reporters.</p>
<p>“I’ll just speak for myself,” Bell said. “I haven't really looked into any of those articles or heard any of those quotes. I know every day is a blessing, so you’ve got to play this game like it's your last.</p>
<p>“We have such a great group of young guys that I'm excited to be around and play with. I love being here. I love being a Pirate. I'm sure everybody else on the club would say the same thing. But those decisions aren't for us to make. That's above my pay grade.”</p>
<p><strong><span>‘Cool experience’</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Will Craig didn't have any sort of obvious first from his MLB debut on Thursday. He drove a ball to the warning track and did a split at first base, but the 2016 first-round pick did not enjoy some sort of fairytale ending where his first hit was a walkoff homer or anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span>Craig, though, did say that one moment stood out. That was when he walked to the plate for his first at-bat and was greeted by Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina.</span></p>
<p>"Yadi looked up to me and said, ‘Congrats,’ ” Craig said. "I was like, ‘OK, that’s pretty cool. Yadi telling me congrats, that was a pretty cool experience.’</p>
<p><span>“Those first couple pitches when I eventually got into the box was when it kind of hit me, for sure.”</span></p>
<p><span>One interesting thing that came out of a pregame Zoom call with Craig involved the work he did at the Pirates' satellite camp in Altoona.</span></p>
<p><span>Although full-scale games have been hard to replicate, Craig said those working out at PNG Field often try to replicate the scouting reports given to the major league club and whoever the Pirates are playing that night.</span></p>
<p><span>Like for the Cardinals and figuring out where they might play Molina, Paul DeJong or Tommy Edman, Pirates players would shift into different defenses and do live-ball drills to work through cuts and relays.</span></p>
<p>"The staff down there was amazing," Craig said. "They were able to give us all the tools and information we needed."</p>
<p><span>Getting the promotion was something Craig said he expected, although he wasn't necessarily happy with what he did in spring training. Craig admitted that he struggled but started to hit his stride toward the end; Craig was optioned to Class AAA Indianapolis on March 9, a couple days before the season shut down.</span></p>
<p><span>The work Craig said he did there helped, although he called not getting invited to spring training 2.0 "a little shocking." It was absolutely a motivating factor for him to prove via the Altoona site that he warranted a promotion to the big leagues.</span></p>
<p>"When they told me I was going to Altoona, I was like, 'OK, I’m going to use this as a chance to get as many reps as I can at first base, see as many pitches as I can, go to the field every day as early as I can and maximize my time down there,' ” Craig said. "I was given an opportunity to work with the guys down there. The staff was amazing. They were able to push me every day to accomplish something new. It was definitely a little chip on my shoulder, for sure.”</p>
<p><strong><span>Around the horn</span></strong></p>
<p><span>• Shelton said that Kyle Crick threw another game Friday and would play catch Saturday. They expect to make a decision soon on the reliever's availability.</span></p>
<p><span>• Cody Ponce was optioned to Altoona Friday because the Pirates needed the bullpen availability, Shelton said. "He's not going to be available for a few days," Shelton said. "To keep him when he's not available isn't efficient for our bullpen."</span></p>
<p>• Shelton said the Pirates would have a better idea after Friday's game on the availability of recent acquisitions such as outfielder Anthony Alford and pitchers Carson Fulmer and Austin Davis, as they're currently undergoing intake testing.</p>
