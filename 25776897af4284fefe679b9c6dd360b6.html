<h1>Etna council to craft non-discrimination ordinance </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A group of Etna council members and residents are meeting at 7 p.m. tonight to design a new ordinance to help everyone in the community live together tranquilly no matter how they self-identify.</p>
<p>The goal of the non-discrimination ordinance is to advise residents of the small borough how to treat and address neighbors who are openly LGBTQ. During the February Etna council meeting, when plans for the ordinance were first introduced, Allison Butka said they are comfortable with their identity as transgender and were happy to speak. Transgender people feel that the sex they were assigned at birth doesn’t match their gender identity, or the gender that they feel they are inside. Mx Butka uses the pronouns they and their.</p>
<p>“I’m used to thinking about this every day,” Mx Butka said when asked if they were comfortable speaking. “If it’s not part of your life, you might not think about it.”</p>
<p>What does Mx Butka want the non-discrimination ordinance to convey? “You are safe here. We know how to make you feel welcome. I think that’s really important.”</p>
<p>Pete Ramage, council chairman, said he agreed with what they said about the need for non-discrimination protections for borough residents. He suggested the committee be headed by Jessica Semler, the first openly gay council member and the person Mx Butka first contacted about the idea. Council members Ron Trader, Greg Porter, Megan Tunon and Rudy Milcic agreed to join.</p>
<p>When the ordinance is written and passed by council, it will join nearly 20 Etna ordinances that are about to be formally codified and added to the borough’s website. Mary Ellen Ramage, borough manager and secretary, has been working on the project for nearly three years. Council member Dave Becki and Code Enforcement Officer Bob Snyder have been working with her on the project.</p>
<p>“Once the ordinances are on the computer, residents will spend a lot less time when looking for something,” Mr. Becki said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ramage said they may update the borough website as well.</p>
<p>While there is no state law protecting LGBTQ residents from discrimination, Pennsylvania municipalities are permitted to enact their own equality laws and policies. There are many local Pennsylvania municipalities contemplating such ordinances and the Etna group is studying them and borrowing the best bits for their own proposal.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ramage said the group met early in January for orientation and Ms. Semler asked about the process for introducing legislation and reporting progress to council. “She was just so thorough,” Mrs. Ramage said, “we were able to put it on the February agenda.”</p>
<p>While the group first reviewed Ross Township’s ordinance, which is very strict, they decided to see what smaller towns have passed. Camp Hill, Doylestown, State College and a dozen other similar-sized boroughs and townships offered their own ordinances for study. “We’ve found this process works very well for us,” Mrs. Ramage said.</p>
<p>While Mrs. Ramage guides the group, which includes both straight and LGBTQ members, they are deferring the gist of the law to those who live with sexual-orientation discrimination daily. “This has been a part of their lives,” she said. At the same time, the straight members provide context. “You have to help people understand that it’s a learned thing. It’s not something everyone experiences. When you are trying to change thinking, you have to do it from the inside. That’s how things move forward.”</p>
<p>She likened it to recycling. “It took me a long time to learn to put things in the right bins and not throw it out. This, too, will be a learning experience.”</p>
<p>While local ordinances continue to enlighten the public, state lawmakers are considering the Pennsylvania Fairness Act. It would update the 1955 Human Relations Act, which already protects citizens from discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, age, sex, national origin and disability by adding protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>
<p>In the next several months, the U.S. Supreme Court will be judging three separate cases to determine if federal anti-discrimination laws protect people based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, particularly in the workplace.</p>
