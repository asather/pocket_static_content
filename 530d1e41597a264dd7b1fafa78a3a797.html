<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Thursday announced nearly $324 million has been awarded to 31 hospitals to help cover costs associated with surges of COVID-19 cases in their areas.</p>
<p>Included in the list are three rural Western Pennsylvania hospitals: Monongahela Valley Hospital in Washington County, which will receive $15 million; ACMH in Armstrong County, $12 million; and Indiana Regional Medical Center in Indiana County, $10 million.</p>
<p>The fund, according to the governor’s office, is designed to “provide immediate financial support for working capital to ensure that these facilities have sufficient personnel, equipment, and personal protective equipment.”</p>
<p>The Hospital Emergency Loan Program (HELP) funding was dispersed by the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority and is being administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development through the Pennsylvania First Program.</p>
