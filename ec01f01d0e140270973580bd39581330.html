<p>Back-to-school time can be stressful for any family. Add a global pandemic to that scenario and the anxiety is enough to make you grind your teeth in your sleep.</p>
<p>Even as families weigh whether to have their kids return to the classroom amid COVID-19 or rely on at-home learning, students will still need supplies for the school year.</p>
<p>So the Salvation Army’s fifth annual Back-to-School Bash came at a welcome time — even if the usual neighborhood cookout atmosphere with a bounce house and games was dropped due to public health precautions. This year attendees were encouraged to stay in their cars and social distance.</p>
<p>The event, held at The Salvation Army Pittsburgh Temple Worship and Service Center in Mt. Lebanon on Saturday, offered students new backpacks filled with school supplies, as well as gently used clothes, shoes and free haircuts.</p>
<p>About 180 students received backpacks and about 30 left with a haircut, which were provided by volunteers from the North Hills Beauty Academy.</p>
<p>“It’s such an usual time because different communities are figuring out what to do about school and the need is up,” said Salvation Army Capt. Justin Caldwell “Our phone lines have been ringing off the hook in need of assistance. For the families, during this time, something like this goes a long way.”</p>
<p>As needs have surged during the pandemic, one of the areas the Salvation Army in Mt. Lebanon has seen the most demand is the food pantry on Thursdays, Capt. Caldwell said.</p>
<p>“We’ve always had the food pantry, but that’s been one of the biggest changes,” he said. The boxes, fortunately, are able to include fresh items donated by grocers like Whole Foods and Fresh Market. A case worker also is on hand to help people with information on utilities, rent and vouchers for clothes and other needs.</p>
<p>“When a family is going through a difficult time, you start to question, ‘How am I going to do this?’ and the hopelessness starts to settle in. But when the community comes together to help, it’s a way to give people hope,” Capt. Caldwell said.</p>
<p>The Back-To-School-Bash was sponsored by First National Bank.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to partner with The Salvation Army to provide supplies and support for students and their parents so they can feel prepared and ready to focus on education in the coming school year,” said Ronald Donatelli, Pittsburgh regional president, First National Bank, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t do this without the community helping to make this happen,” Capt. Caldwell said. “It’s not the Salvation Army. We’re just the instruments. The people are giving through us.”</p>
