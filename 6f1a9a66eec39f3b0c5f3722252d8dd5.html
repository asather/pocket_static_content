<p>WASHINGTON —&nbsp;After <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/21/impeachment-trial-donald-trump-senate-republicans-subpoenas-democrats-amendment-witnesses/stories/202001210165" target="_blank">losing a 12-hour debate</a> on whether the Senate should be required to call witnesses and subpoena documents in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, the House impeachment managers will regroup Wednesday and make their case for Mr. Trump’s removal.</p>
<p>The House managers —&nbsp;six Democrats who were deeply involved in the impeachment inquiry last fall — have a total of 24 hours to deliver opening arguments in the third impeachment trial in U.S. history. That will be spread&nbsp;over a period of three, 8-hour sessions, while all 100 senators listen silently.</p>
<p>The impeachment debate centers around accusations that Mr. Trump’s temporarily froze of nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine as part of a broader pressure campaign on that country to investigate Mr. Trump’s political rival and former vice president, Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The House voted to impeach Mr. Trump in December, charging the president with abuse of power and obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>In the Senate trial and after the House managers conclude their case, White House lawyers will have an equal amount of time — 24 hours —&nbsp;for opening arguments in defense of the president.</p>
<p>Senators will then have up to 16 hours to ask questions of both sides. Only after the opening arguments and questioning will the Senate consider demanding more information.</p>
<p>Here’s how events are unfolding today:</p>

<p><strong>Schiff opens Democrats’ arguments for President Trump’s removal</strong></p>
<p>House Democrats are back on the floor of the U.S. Senate to argue for President Donald Trump’s removal for office.</p>
<p>Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chair of the House Intelligence Committee, opened by reviewing the core case against Mr. Trump, which includes two articles of impeachment passed by the House in December: one on abuse of power, one on obstruction of Congress.</p>
<p>The president “abused the powers of his office to cheat in an election” by pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into a political rival. At the center of that pressure, Mr. Schiff argued, was nearly $400 million in military aid that Congress had earmarked for Ukraine in its fight against Russia.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump pushed Ukraine based on a “debunked” belief, Mr. Schiff said, that former Vice President Joe Biden forced an anti-corruption official in that country to resign because his son, Hunter Biden, sat on the board of an energy company that had come under scrutiny. The former vice president is running against Mr. Trump in this year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>Mr. Schiff said a response to Mr. Trump’s actions “cannot be decided at the ballot box” because the integrity of the elections are at stake.</p>
<p>Mr. Schiff has up to two hours before the Senate takes a short break.</p>
