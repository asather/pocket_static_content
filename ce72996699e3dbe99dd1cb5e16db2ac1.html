<h1>Pa.’s fracking jobs enter debate fray</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A battle that’s been playing out on the airwaves and behind podiums in Western Pennsylvania this presidential campaign season made its way to the vice presidential debate on Wednesday night, as Mike Pence continued his ticket’s warning that a Biden administration would immediately ban fracking and Kamala Harris insisted that her running mate has been&nbsp;“very clear” that he won’t.</p>

<p>Mr. Pence, bragging that the Trump administration has&nbsp;“unleashed American energy” in its first term, said Democrat Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris would&nbsp;“abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking, which would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs all across the heartland.”&nbsp;The Trump campaign followed up with an email, claiming that such a fracking ban would&nbsp;“decimate” 609,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden has said his policy plan is to&nbsp;cease new oil and gas drilling permits on federal land and offshore. Most fracking in Pennsylvania —&nbsp;the second largest natural gas-producing state in the country — is done on private land.</p>
<p>In the debate, Ms. Harris countered that Mr. Biden would not&nbsp;“end fracking” and that he has&nbsp;“been very clear about that.”</p>
<p>“I will repeat — and the American people know — that Joe Biden will not ban fracking,” Ms. Harris said. “That is a fact.”</p>
<p>But as Mr. Pence pointed out, Mr. Biden hasn’t always been clear, and has said things about fracking that his campaign has had to clarify. Ms. Harris herself has said&nbsp;“there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” but added that it starts with&nbsp;“what we can do on day one around public lands.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden said last year, when asked by a CNN anchor in a debate if there’d be a place for fracking, fossil fuels and coal in his presidency,&nbsp;“We would work it out” — prompting a clarification from his campaign that the candidate wants&nbsp;to get to a 100% clean energy economy and to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. He also said the words&nbsp;“no new fracking” in a debate in March, which his campaign clarified to say he was referring to his proposal to ban new permits on federal land.</p>
<p>“Fracking has to continue because we need a transition,” Mr. Biden said during a televised town hall in September. “We’re going to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, and we’ll get to net-zero power emissions by 2035. But there’s no rationale to eliminate, right now, fracking.”</p>
<p>During Wednesday’s debate, Mr. Pence said he knows Mr. Biden now says otherwise about fracking,&nbsp;“but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s campaign blamed the Trump administration for&nbsp;“abdicating” its responsibility to address climate change, and said&nbsp;“they’ve&nbsp;made a sad attempt to mislead America’s workers about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ plans for energy sustainability and their positions on fossil fuels and fracking."</p>
<p>“Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will protect good-paying union jobs in places like Pennsylvania, and Harris has been clear that pitting jobs and our environment against one another is a false choice,” the Biden campaign wrote. “Here’s the truth: a Biden-Harris Administration would not ban fracking — but it would build on a long record supporting workers, reinstating and fortifying pro-labor protections that the Trump-Pence administration have callously rolled back.”</p>
