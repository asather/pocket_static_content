<h1>Letters from Pirates camp: Picking up an assist from the other 'Billy G'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">BRADENTON, Fla. — Pie Traynor would’ve been sick about it.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Sunday afternoon at Pirates Fantasy Camp began with a draft, where I was selected in an unspecified round by Rick Reuschel and R.J. Reynolds on Team Traynor, and it ended with me taking extra swings because I was so disgusted with how poorly I played.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The good part, though, was who I met along that journey and what one of those guys taught me.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Bill Goodrich is an extremely accomplished personal-injury lawyer in Pittsburgh and runs his own firm, Goodrich &amp; Geist, P.C. But on the baseball field, he’s simply “Billy G.,” a 67-year-old guy with a mustache and a bandana on his head, and on this day, like me, he was frustrated. Really frustrated.</span></p>
<p>Neither of us hit particularly well. I botched a couple plays in the infield, over-running one ball at shortstop and flat-out booting another. Billy G. was doubled off to end the game — a lopsided loss — after losing track of how many outs we had.</p>
<p>So Billy G. and I decided to blow off a little steam and get some extra work in the batting cages, which were still open. Like many have during my journey here thus far, a conversation with Billy G. only further reinforced why this camp is so popular, why people keep coming back and why $4,000 or $5,000 isn’t really a big price tag when you consider the feelings that money can produce.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“It’s really a lot of fun,” Goodrich said. “It’s a bunch of grown men out here trying to re-live the time when everything was much easier, much simpler and much more carefree.”</span></p>
<p>That’s not the extent of the allure for Goodrich, either. His wife, Allegheny County Common Pleas judge Beth Lazzara, purchased the trip for her husband, a 60th birthday present back in 2013.</p>
<p>“She said, ‘The first one’s on me, the rest are on you,’ ” Goodrich said.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">They have been and will continue to be because Goodrich loves how the camp keeps him healthy. Having lost his two brothers to heart-related issues over the past three years, Goodrich has adjusted his diet and works out daily, all so he’s ready for fantasy camp.</span></p>
<p>Along with several people I’ve met here, he works out from roughly the start of November until fantasy camp at Sports and Courts in Wexford, the group of 15-20 guys kicking in $10 apiece to spend 90 minutes to two hours throwing, fielding, running and hitting.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">It’s something I really wish I had done before coming to this thing.</span></p>
<p>“It probably has made me a healthier man,” Goodrich said. “I work out every day in an effort to make sure that I don’t make a fool out of myself when I come down here, no matter what age I am ... although [Sunday] was pretty close to making a fool out of myself. But it wasn’t because of physical attributes. It’s because my skills were poor.”</p>
<p>Ditto, Billy G. Ditto.</p>
<p>“I weigh less now than I did 40 years ago when I graduated law school,” said Goodrich, who grew up in Garfield, went to Penn Hills and Duquesne and now lives in Brighton Heights. “I have a 32-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old daughter. I’ll be 68. She’ll be 15. I want to be able to walk her down the aisle when she gets married, as I did with my older one.</p>
<p>“My wife has 22 more years on the bench. What am I going to do? There are three things that happen to guys with a little bit of money and a lot of time. They become drunks, get involved with drugs or chase women. All three of those lead to bad, bad things. So I continue working, and I do this.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Hard to argue there, although it’s tough to keep things in proper perspective when you’re both frustrated, which brings us back to the cages.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Goodrich said he was never much of a baseball player. He was actually cut from his high school team but has always loved the game. “I am a pretty good coach,” he said, and he’s right.</span></p>
<p>My three at-bats Sunday afternoon produced three ground balls to the exact same spot: third base. They were decently hard hit, but I was getting zero lift, and my timing was horrendous; I was out in front of everything, though I didn’t know it at the time.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Your front foot,” Billy G. yelled to me between pitches. “Get your weight back.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Wouldn’t you know it, on the next couple pitches I thought about that, I kept my weight back, and I started to hit the ball in the air. Not sure I hit a single grounder to third during our entire time in the cage, honestly.</span></p>
<p>It’s one of the many things I love about baseball: The fact that you can recognize a problem, hopefully identify a solution, and in an instant, put that into practice. Now, it also stinks that sometimes it comes undone just as quickly, but I have not yet found a way to change that. If I do, I’ll be sure to bottle it, sell it and retire.</p>
<p>“You all try to help each other here,” Billy G. said. “There are guys who have obviously played ball. There are guys who probably never batted before in their life, but it seemed like a fun thing to do. So you help ‘em.</p>
<p>“It’s become sort of a fraternity, too. I don’t see a lot of these guys for 51 weeks, but when we see each other on the 52nd week, it’s like we saw each other yesterday.”</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Around the horn</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">• Had dinner tonight with Vernon Law and the four female campers. The latter will make for a really fun story later in the week. What a terrific group of women.</span></p>
<p>• I thought physically I would make it through this thing fine. I might’ve lied. Already on the first day I’m sore, specifically my right arm, left knee and right foot. That proves to me how different running is from baseball, full of twisting and turning and stopping and starting, movements few of us do on a regular basis.</p>
<p>• Was told to try the cold tub tomorrow. Pirates players are big into it, specifically Josh Bell. Think I might have to try that one out.</p>
<p>• Bill Goodrich told me he has met Bill Guerin — the originally Billy G. — and the two have debated to whom the nickname actually belongs. Tough to argue with a lawyer.</p>
