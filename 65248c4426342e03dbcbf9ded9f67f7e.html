<h1>Fall semester shrouded in uncertainty for Pennsylvania schools</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Smaller class sizes and students equipped with digital devices would have been a dream for many educators two months ago, but that’s what may be necessary if&nbsp;schools hope to reopen in the fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When we return back to school, they will not look like the schools that we participated in a little over a month ago,” state Secretary of Education Pedro A. Rivera said Tuesday during a conference call.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that schools will reopen in the fall if the COVID-19 pandemic continues, according to Mr. Rivera. He said the DOE will use data from the Department of Health to determine when schools can resume in their brick-and-mortar settings.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivera said the education department is&nbsp;“planning for the best, but we’re preparing for the worst,” and acknowledged that&nbsp;there is “a great deal of uncertainty.”</p>
<p>The same goes for the Pittsburgh Public Schools.</p>
<p>“We are certainly preparing ourselves to be able to deliver full synchronous online learning for all of our students in the fall because of the level of uncertainty,” Superintendent Anthony Hamlet said Thursday in a video conference. “We just don’t know, so we want to be prepared for what’s out there. We want to be prepared for a brick-and-mortar, we want to be prepared for online.”</p>
<p>As that work continues at the local levels, the state is thinking about how to shape schools for whatever scenario comes next.</p>
<p>“We have a few schools of thought in the Department of Education,” Mr. Rivera said. “We’re planning for what schools are going to look like when we return, we’re planning for what this might look like if there’s prolonged cases of COVID that force us to keep schools closed, but we’re also having a conversation: What if it’s a combination of both?”</p>
<p>He said the department was looking at creating a staggered system that considers the academic and health needs of students.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Mr. Hamlet said, that could mean reducing class sizes to make social distancing possible for students and teachers. He said he has discussed the possibility of splitting up students into different days when they are expected to attend or times when they are expected to start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s a multitude of possibilities that could happen, and we just have to wait to see what the guidelines are when the commonwealth opens up again to make those decisions,” Mr. Hamlet said.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivera said students and staff may need to adhere to social distancing guidelines and wear masks if schools reopen.</p>
<p>The DOE is trying to figure out how that could work for aspects of schooling outside the classroom, like in the cafeteria, on school buses and at athletic and extracurricular events. It is also working to determine how to best handle the mental and physical health needs of students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Those are the questions that we’re engaging our partners in now,” Mr. Rivera said.</p>
<p>With the potential that at least some instruction will continue outside of the classroom next school year, the need for all students to have devices has become more important. Many local districts have worked to provide devices to all students, but lack of money, resources and a backed up supply chain have caused challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Hamlet said Pittsburgh Public Schools had a long-term vision that every student in the district would have a device to take home and use for assignments, but the pandemic shutdown pushed the district to move in that direction faster.</p>
<p>Despite purchasing thousands of laptops and accepting donations of hundreds more, the district still has not met that goal. Ted Dwyer, the district’s chief of data, research, assessment and accountability, said Thursday that the city schools still had to acquire about 7,400 laptops to ensure all of the students who needed them had one.</p>
<p>“We know that a child can still learn without a device, but we want it to be equitable,” Mr. Dwyer said.</p>
