<h1>Pandemic poses risk to Ford sales during major launch, but dealerships still have engines running — for now</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Few businesses have been untouched by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Ford is no exception. But the auto manufacturer has recently seen an unexpected economic upturn in one sector of its sales: trucks.</p>
<p>Truck sales made up 17% of the company’s revenue in March, 21% in April and 15% in May, said Mark LaNeve, vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service for Ford. Usually, truck sales account for 13% of the total.</p>
<p>As it happens, it’s fortunate for Ford that truck sales specifically are on the rise.</p>

<p>The auto manufacturer recently launched its 2021 F-150, a newly redesigned version of the brand’s flagship pickup truck.</p>
<p>At dealerships in Western Pennsylvania, the launch day came with minimal pomp and circumstance. At Shults Ford South in West Mifflin, an employee took visitors’ temperatures at the reception desk and asked them to sign in while a few salespeople sat at socially distanced desks with prospective buyers. There were no people milling around the shiny new vehicles in the lot, and the 2021 F-150s weren’t on prominent display.</p>
<p>Releasing a major product during an economic downturn is a risky move, and the product in question isn’t exactly cheap. The new F-150 will cost buyers anywhere from $30,000 to $70,000, depending on what version they’re buying —&nbsp;and that’s without any add-ons.</p>
<p>Sharon Carty, editor-in-chief of auto enthusiast magazine Car and Driver, said holding the launch, which had already been delayed once due to the pandemic, was “necessary” to ensure customer demand continues for Ford’s signature truck.</p>
<p>“This is not like a luxury car being introduced. This is a workhorse. This is a car that people use for their jobs, primarily, so they get worn out; they need to be replaced,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The demand for F-150s has been consistent for a very long time, and to stay fresh in the market, automakers like Ford need to continue improving, and they need to continue reinventing themselves and coming out with new products. Otherwise, the demand does start to go away.”</p>
<p>In the Ford second-quarter earnings report, the company reported total sales of 180,825 F-series pickups (the data isn’t separated by model year), a 2.6% increase in the truck’s share of the company’s overall earnings.</p>
<p>Ford announced on June 29 buyers who purchase vehicles from the company via Ford Credit can return them within one year in the event of job loss and will be given a more forgiving refund than under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>The move reflects the need to keep money flowing in; the automaker reported a loss of around $2 billion in the first quarter due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Most Ford dealerships in Pennsylvania have stayed open throughout the various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, only for repairs and other essential services in the early stages.</p>
<p>These services are especially critical, Mr. LaNeve said, because many emergency service vehicles, including ambulances and fire trucks, are made by Ford.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, several of the company’s commercial utility vehicles, including the F-150, are used by contractors and landscapers at work sites.&nbsp;“Those folks were still using their trucks,” Mr. LaNeve said.</p>
<p>Ivan Drury, senior manager of insights at auto information site Edmunds, doesn’t think there’s much of a bright side to the circumstances of the F-150 launch. “It’s not going to help by any means, other than that if people are staying at home, they have a little more time to research, get more in-depth with looking up features.”</p>
<p>But, he said, “Because it is such a huge launch for Ford and the industry — it’s seen as such an iconic vehicle — there will still be all eyes on the F-150.”</p>
<p>In a 2018 J.D. Power ranking, the Ford F-150 light-duty full-size truck was described as being the best-selling pickup in the country for more than four decades.</p>
<p>Mr. Drury sees a particular problem with remote sales of the truck known for being highly convertible with different features for individual customers’ needs.</p>
<p>“Getting out and test-driving one makes a world of difference. Seeing, touching and understanding capabilities can completely change what you think you want, what you actually need and how much you’re going to spend,” he said.</p>
<p>And the economic consequences of the pandemic aren’t likely to give the car industry a break either.</p>
<p>For small business owners, for example, “You might try and make do with what you have for longer and just might not have the funds to replenish your fleet the way you had initially planned,” Ms. Carty said.</p>
<p>However, she noted the truck market has a particularly loyal subset of customers who are likely to continue supporting their favored brand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one potential source of new sales for the automotive industry these days: There’s a sector of people — especially essential workers in jobs with a high COVID-19 transmission risk — who didn’t own cars before the pandemic but are now buying them for a safer way to get to work.</p>
<p>“They’re definitely helping to inject new blood into the market,” Mr. Drury said.</p>
