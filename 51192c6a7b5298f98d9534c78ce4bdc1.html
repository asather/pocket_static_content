<h1>Former WQED editor makes the 2020 Oscars cut with 'The Irishman'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Back in 1975, Thelma Schoonmaker helped create a National Geographic series for WQED public television about the upcoming Pittsburgh bicentennial. “Decades of Decision” was a five-part imagining of what life was like for ordinary citizens during the American Revolution.</p>
<p>Schoonmaker, 80, is still exploring the American experience, but in a vastly different arena. As longtime editor for director Martin Scorsese, she has helped shape how filmgoers see his vision. She’s been really good at it. And on Sunday she might bring home her third Academy Award for doing so, this time for “The Irishman.”</p>
<p>The 92nd Oscars ceremony will be at the Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood &amp; Vine Center, with red carpet strolls beginning around 6:30 p.m. EST and the big show at 8 p.m. ABC will carry live coverage on numerous platforms, including broadcast, cable and its ABC.GO app.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh native Billy Porter will be among the hosts with Tamron Hall, Elvis Mitchell, Ryan Seacrest and Lily Aldridge for ABC’s red carpet look just before the awards broadcast.</p>
<p>Cord-cutters can stream through a number of sites, including Hulu With Live TV, YouTube TV, PlayStation Vue, <a href="https://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">Oscars.Go.Com</a> and with The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/theacademy?lang=en" target="_blank">@TheAcademy</a> . Hulu will have the festivities for regular subscribers Monday. The official Oscars press site notes the awards will be viewed in 225 countries and territories.</p>
<p>On E!, red carpet will be aggressively reported starting around 1 p.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>Nine films are vying for Best Picture: “Ford v Ferrari,” “The Irishman,” “Jojo Rabbit,” “Joker,” “Little Women,” “Marriage Story,” “1917,” “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” and “Parasite.”</p>
<p>“Joker” has the most nominations with 11, followed by “The Irishman,” “1917” and “Once Upon a Time” with 10. Netflix, which produced “Marriage Story,” has 24 nominations. Disney/Fox is next with 23. Sony Pictures&nbsp;— which produced the shot-in-Pittsburgh Fred Rogers’ tale, “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood”&nbsp;— has 20.</p>
<p>Schoonmaker won her nprevious Oscars for “Raging Bull” (1980), “The Aviator” (2004) and “The Departed” (2006).</p>
<p>A graduate of Cornell University who met Scorsese more than 50 years ago in a summer program at New York University, Schoonmaker was once asked how she could work on such violent films. She famously answered “Marty’s movies aren’t violent until I cut them.”</p>
<p>With eight each, she and Steven Spielberg collaborator Michael Kahn hold the record for most Oscar nominations in editing. They, along, with Ralph Dawson and Daniel Mandell, have all won three times.</p>

<p>Depending on how one takes stock in Oscars lore, consider Schoonmaker’s nomination a big plus for “The Irishman.” Only once in the past 40 years has a film won Best Picture without a nomination for editing.</p>
<p>Director Sam Mendes “1917,” which employs a bit of neat trickery to appear it was filmed in one unbroken shot, is a strong Best Picture candidate but was not nominated for editing.</p>
<p>“Birdman,” starring Pittsburgh native Michael Keaton, was the exception — it won the big prize at the 2015 Oscars without an editing nomination. Like “1917,” the film was shot to make long scenes appear unbroken by cuts.</p>
<p>Although the Pittsburgh-shot&nbsp;“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” did not get a Best Picture nomination, star Tom Hanks is up for best supporting actor. Marielle Heller was among the women left out, for a second straight year, in the directing categories. With Lulu Wang (“The Farewell”), Greta Gerwig (“Little Women”) and Lorene Scafaria (“Hustlers”), she’s in good company.</p>
<p>Like last year, the Oscars will not have an official host but will employ a bevy of stars to introduce each category. The 2019 winners for acting&nbsp;— Olivia Colman, Rami Malek, Regina King and Mahershala Ali&nbsp;— will grace the stage to hand out those winners’ statuettes.</p>
<p>For no apparent reason, Billie Eilish will sing at the ceremony. For the third consecutive year, an actress nominee will also perform a nominated song. Broadway superstar Cynthia Erivo (“Harriet”) will sing&nbsp;“Stand Up.” Mary J. Blige (“Mudbound”) and Lady Gaga (“A Star is Born”) were previous performers.</p>
<p>This year’s performers for nominated songs are Randy Newman (“I Can’t Let You Throw Yourself Away” from&nbsp;“Toy Story 4”), Elton John (“I’m Gonna Love Me Again” from&nbsp;“Rocketman”), Chrissy Metz (“I’m Standing With You” from&nbsp;“Breakthrough”) and Idina Menzel (“Into the Unknown” from&nbsp;“Frozen II”).</p>

<p>No word yet if John Travolta will introduce Menzel, but we can hope. Hollywood loves a second chance, after all.</p>
