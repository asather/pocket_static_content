<h1>Fishing Report: Anglers hook catfish, smallmouths and hybrid striped bass </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Lake Erie</strong> (Erie County) Warm and cool water flipped position as the lake turned over last week, creating an uncomfortable condition for most fish. Small numbers of migrating walleye crossed the Ohio-Pennsylvania line at all depths, while ’eyes were caught on worm harnesses and spoons in less than 20 feet off Walnut Creek and north of Gull Point. Tyler Lokey of Oakdale boated a nice walleye in 50 feet of water east of Walnut while trolling a deep diving Bay Rat spoon off a planer board. Anglers reported hookups with keeper-size yellow perch and largemouth bass in the bay. As smallmouths started moving to deeper, cooler waters, anglers caught them at all depths from the peninsula to waters east of North East. Thunderstorms and winds from the west-southwest are expected Saturday throughout the Erie area.</p>
<p><strong>Shenango Reservoir</strong> (Mercer County) Northern pike, largemouths and hybrid striped bass were taken, and panfish moved to deeper, cooler water. Enrolled in the Panfish Enhancement Program, the crappie harvest limit is 9 inches with a creel limit of 20.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Venango County) Good fishing was reported with Northern pike, smallmouths, channel catfish and walleye taking crankbaits and other lures.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Arthur</strong> (Butler County) Anglers caught hybrid striped bass as they chased alewives from dusk through dawn. Largemouths went for crankbaits throughout the lake. As waters warmed, crappies moved deeper.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kiskiminetas River</strong> (Armstrong County) Six smallmouths were caught and released within an hour on a green floating-sinking crankbait Tuesday evening.</p>
<p><strong>North Park Lake</strong> (Allegheny County) Heavy angler pressure was reported, and largemouth bass were caught on live minnows and crankbaits. A golden rainbow trout in the 20-inch range was caught on a chartreuse jig and released below the upper dam.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio River</strong> (Allegheny County) A flathead catfish weighing 22 pounds was caught and released in the Emsworth Dam tailrace, where white bass and smallmouths chased baitfish along the river’s shallow edges.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Allegheny County) While fishing from shore on the morning of June 19, Michael Purcell of the North Shore landed and released a 42-inch, 33-pound flathead. Venture Outdoors’ annual TriAnglers fishing program will return to the North Shore July 1 and continue 11:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Wednesdays through summer.
