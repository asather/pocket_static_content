<h1>Wesco secures $4.5 billion deal to acquire Anixter after bidding war</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Wesco International Inc. triumphed over a private equity firm in its battle to acquire Anixter International, a distributor of electrical and data communication products based in Illinois.</p>
<p>Station Square-based Wesco, which is among the largest distributors of construction, industrial, electrical and other supplies in the U.S., signed a merger agreement with Anixter on Jan. 10.</p>
<p>Anixter was previously due to be acquired by the New York-based private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, LLC. Wesco has agreed to pay the $100 million penalty that Anixter now owes to its former suitor for breaking the deal.</p>
<p>The Wesco deal is valued at $4.5 billion and includes a combination of $70 in cash, Wesco common stock, and a newly-created category of preferred Wesco stock for each share of Anixter stock that shareholders own.</p>
<p>It is expected to close in the second or third quarter of this year, but still needs regulatory approvals in the U.S., Canada, and some other countries.</p>
<p>With its 9,300 employees, Wescoâ€™s acquisition of Anixter will mean a combined company of 18,600 employees and $17 billion in annual revenue.</p>
