<p>While snow gave way to drizzle in the Pittsburgh area Saturday afternoon, winds, sleet and ice in northwestern Pennsylvania prompted PennDOT to place restrictions on travel for trucks and some other vehicles on the entirety of Interstate 86 and Interstate 90.</p>
<p>The restrictions started at noon Saturday. PennDOT banned passenger vehicles, recreational vehicles, motorcycles, buses, and tractors without trailers or with unloaded or lightly loaded trailers.</p>
<p>For those few vehicles allowed on those interstates, speed limits are restricted to 45 mph and driving is allowed in the right lane only.</p>
<p>PennDOT also reduced the speed limit on Interstate 79 northbound from Cranberry on, and on all of Interstate 80, to 45 mph, with commercial vehicles restricted to the right lane.</p>
<p>PennDOT has been applying anti-ice materials to many state roads, according to its news release.</p>
<p>The North Park Ice Rink is closed for the day due to inclement weather, Allegheny County announced Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Snow fell early Saturday in and around Pittsburgh. Roads were slippery, resulting in numerous accidents, including at least one overturned vehicle.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh's Department of Public Works put out 51 snow trucks for 12-hour shifts starting at 2 a.m., according to the city's Twitter feed.</p>
<p>Allegheny County reported Friday that it was deploying 22 salt trucks with plows starting at 2 a.m. Saturday.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service reported early morning temperatures in the high 20s in Pittsburgh, with temperatures expected to rise into the low-40s.</p>
