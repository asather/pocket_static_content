<h1>Religious groups modify some practices to prevent spread of virus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“We gather together,” says the classic hymn.</p>
<p>Often, people gather quite closely for worship, whether seated in crowded pews or&nbsp;standing in tight rows for prayer at a mosque.</p>
<p>That’s just part of how religion, for all its spiritual aspirations, involves tactile, physical activities that raise concerns in the time of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Christians take communion, often from a common cup. Orthodox Christians venerate icons with a kiss, while observant Jews honor the Torah with a kiss.</p>
<p>In the Pittsburgh area, religious groups have taken various steps to reduce the risk of the coronavirus, as well as the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Catholic bishops have temporarily suspended the use of the common chalice at Mass, with communion distributed only in the form of individual wafers, and they’ve said worshipers should do the ritual exchange of peace with a gesture rather than a handshake or hug. Protestant denominations that use the common communion cup have not banned its use but have have said congregations need to consider carefully how to handle the ritual, given that for them the common cup symbolizes their church unity.</p>
<p>Others have begun canceling certain gatherings. The Hindu Jain Temple canceled Sunday’s planned celebrations of the Holi festival, although it is proceeding with other weekend worship as scheduled.</p>
<p>Across religious traditions, religious leaders have recommended, urged or insisted upon a few common precautions. People who are sick should stay home, they said, though they are also urging congregations to find ways to look in on the sick, such as churches having a deacon bring them communion. Those who do attend worship should avoid physical contact like handshakes, and congregations should have plenty of alcohol-based sanitizer at the ready.</p>
<p>Dr. Raymond Pontzer, chief of infectious diseases at UPMC-St. Margaret Hospital, said he recognizes it’s difficult for religious congregations to ask their members to limit common expressions of fellowship like hugs and handshakes. But he said such would be good practice&nbsp;during the ongoing flu outbreak alone, and additionally so with the COVID-19.</p>
<p>Even the basic practice of gathering together can pose risks, he said. People within 6 feet of someone coughing and sneezing can catch what that person has, and that’s on airplanes where the air circulation is actually better than in most buildings such as houses of worship, Dr. Pontzer said.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important that people&nbsp;“avoid coming when they’re sick,” he said.&nbsp;“That’s an important message the leaders should put out to congregants.”</p>
<p>At the same time, regular worship continues.</p>
<p>“If you are healthy, come to church!” Pittsburgh Episcopal Bishop Dorsey McConnell wrote to his flock. “As The Body of Christ, we are&nbsp;called to community, and so we come together for prayer, Eucharist and fellowship.&nbsp;Nothing in the current state of the coronavirus outbreak should stop us from doing that.”</p>
<p>Bishop Jim Hobby of the Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh wrote to his congregations, “Along with being a people of hope, I want us to be a people of courage and compassion, ministering to those who are sick when others shy away.” At the same time, he urged common-sense precautions and preceded his signature with, “Praying fervently, living in peace, AND washing my hands.”</p>
<p>Neither bishop is restricting the use of the common communion chalice, leaving the decision to local congregations, but they did issue recommendations and said servers should be careful to use hand sanitizer before distributing communion and to follow the usual practice of wiping the cup’s brim with a cloth and rotating it between each person’s use.</p>
<p>Bishop Hobby said individual congregations should consider such things as having communion with bread only during the ongoing season of Lent, or to have the person serving the communion wine dip or “intinct” the communion wafers in the wine and then hand them to the recipients, rather than each person dipping the wafer (and potentially fingers) into the cup.</p>
<p>Bishop McConnell asked that worshipers not intinct the bread, which he said causes more of a risk of spreading germs than drinking from the common cup.</p>
<p>At Shaare Torah&nbsp;Congregation, an Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Squirrel Hill, leaders issued regulations Friday that those who are sick should stay home, and they asked worshipers to refrain from honoring with a kiss the Torah or the mezuzot, a box containing Scripture written on parchment that is placed on doorposts.</p>
<p>Dr. Pontzer said as a precaution, he would recommend against any activity in which germs could be spread by saliva, such as sharing a communion cup or kissing an object of veneration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I understand there’s tradition,” he said.&nbsp;“But based on medical science, I think you’re asking for trouble.” He said while there’s some risk even with the individual communion cups that some churches use, since they can potentially pass through multiple persons’ hands, but&nbsp;“you have to mitigate the risk.” And worshipers should be sure to wash or sanitize their hands regularly.</p>
<p>Archbishop Elpidophoros of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America issued directives on Friday that said, among other things, that communion would be distributed as usual, but clergy should refrain from handshakes or embraces of the faithful, and worshipers should venerate objects such as icons with a bow rather than a kiss.</p>
<p>The Sri&nbsp;Venkateswara Temple in Penn Hills, a pilgrimage destination for Hindus traveling from the United States and abroad, is taking precautions such as posting signs outside asking those who are sick to refrain from entering until they are well. The temple is also informing employees to stay home if sick, and it’s starting a task force to respond to future developments, said its board secretary,&nbsp;B. Y. Linganna.</p>
<p>The temple had planned to put sanitizer temples throughout the building, but he said that for now, area stores are out of stock.</p>
<p>Virtually all religious leaders gave some variation of a similar theme: They would rely on both practicalities and prayer.</p>
<p>“Science and our God-given reason demand that we employ every means available to protect ourselves and our families against the spread of COVID-19 and any other disease,” Archbishop Elpidophoros said. “ ...&nbsp;As we encourage and strengthen each other, let us also offer our prayers to the Lord our God, that this pandemic might end quickly.”</p>
