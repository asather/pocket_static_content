<h1>Bike ride will pay homage to three McKeesport heroes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cyclists will mix their passion for the trail with a bit of Monongahela Valley heritage on Independence Day by riding to the grave sites of three McKeesport notables who distinguished themselves long ago, including a Medal of Honor recipient buried for eight decades under the wrong name.</p>
<p>"I thought this was a cool way to combine a bike ride with some local history," said organizer Ken Kaszak, a fixture in Pittsburgh cycling who has led historical bike tours of the Hill District and church tours in Homestead, McKeesport and the North Side.</p>
<p>Mr. Kaszak and anyone who chooses to join him will bike from meeting points on the South Side or Homestead to McKeesport-Versailles Cemetery and back, a round-trip trek of about 32 miles.</p>
<p>At the cemetery they'll learn about Pvt. William Sample, one of four Civil War soldiers from the McKeesport area who carried the mortally wounded Abraham Lincoln from Ford's Theatre; aviation pioneer Helen Richey, the first female airline pilot in the U.S.; and Pvt. Franklin J. Phillips, the first U.S. Marine to receive the Medal of Honor posthumously, albeit under a false name.</p>
<p>Mr. Kaszak, an investment advisor and writer, often rides from his South Side office to McKeesport on the Great Allegheny Passage trail; two years ago he visited the cemetery and learned about Pvt. Sample, Ms. Richey and Pvt. Phillips. He thought including their stories as part of a bike trip would be the perfect July 4 outing on the GAP.</p>
<p>"I do these rides on a regular basis and invite others a few times per year," he said. "When I saw July 4th fell on a Saturday this year, I decided to put this one together."</p>
<p>He'll give a brief history lesson at the cemetery before the group heads back.</p>
<p>"It's me telling the story," he said. "It's 75 percent bike ride and 25 percent history."</p>
<p>He's hoping maybe 35 people will join him but said "you never know" who shows up on these rides. If it rains, they'll do it the following day.</p>
<p>Pvt. Sample, Ms. Richey and Pvt. Phillips came of age at different times, but their lives intersected with world events of the day and all were marked by tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>Pvt. William Sample</strong></p>
<p>Pvt. Sample was among four McKeesport-area soldiers who had enlisted in the Union Army in February 1864 and were stationed at Camp Barry, a few miles from the White House.</p>
<p>On April 14, 1865, five days after the war ended, they walked to Ford's Theatre to see the play "Our American Cousin." They were sitting about 15 feet from President Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, when John Wilkes Booth shot the president in the head. The young soldiers rushed to the presidential box, where an Army doctor was tending to the stricken president. The doctor wanted Lincoln moved to a more comfortable place but ruled out the White House, seven blocks away, because he feared the president would die on the way. At the doctor's orders, the McKeesport men and two other soldiers picked up Lincoln and carried him across the street to a boarding house.</p>
<p>"We put him in a room on the first floor," recalled one of the soldiers, Jacob Soles. "We went back through the long hallway to about the middle of the building. There was a bed in that room and we laid him on the bed."</p>
<p>They weren't allowed to stay as the doctors tended to Lincoln. They waited outside until they learned that the president's wound was fatal. Then they walked back to their camp. A war that had cost more American lives than all other wars combined had claimed one more life.</p>
<p>The soldiers returned to civilian life. Soles, a coal miner, retold the Lincoln story to newspapermen in his later years. He died in 1936 at age 90.</p>
<p>The others all died prematurely. Jabez Griffiths, who became a riverboat captain, died of cancer at age 53 in 1898. John Corey drowned when he fell off a coal barge in 1884. And William Sample died on Feb. 25, 1898, after suffering burns in a steel mill accident. He was 52.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Richey</strong></p>
<p>Ms. Richey was a pioneering aviator at a time when female pilots were an anomaly. A contemporary of Amelia Earhart, she became the first female pilot for a U.S. airline in 1934 when she was hired by Central Airlines, a Greensburg-based company in the early days of commercial flight that later became part of United Airlines.</p>
<p>Ms. Richey was born in 1909 in McKeesport, the daughter of the McKeesport school superintendent. She flew her first plane at age 20, flying out of Bettis Field in West Mifflin, and was the first licensed female pilot in Allegheny County. In 1932, she and Frances Marsalis set a women's endurance record by staying airborne for nearly 10 days, refueling in the air. Two years later Ms. Richey won the highest honor at the National Air Meet for Women in Dayton.</p>
<p>She also started flying that year with Central Airlines but sexism quickly derailed her career. She had won her job competing against eight male pilots, but the Airline Pilots Association and the Department of Commerce forced her out, according to an account of her life at the San Diego Air and Space Museum.</p>
<p>She resigned in 1935. It wasn't until 1973 when women were again permitted to be airline pilots.</p>
<p>Ms. Richey continued flying as a barnstormer and performing at air shows. In 1936, she flew with Earhart in a transcontinental race from New York to Los Angeles, finishing fifth and besting several male teams.</p>
<p>In World War II, she traveled to England to fly with the British Air Transportation Authority and then the Women's Airforce Service Pilots in Texas. She was the first female flight instructor licensed by the Civil Aeronautics Authority.</p>
<p>Ms. Richey died in 1947, overdosing on pills in her New York City apartment in an apparent suicide. She was just 37.</p>
<p>"It was a sad end to a promising life," said Mr. Kaszak.</p>
<p><strong>Pvt. Franklin J. Phillips</strong></p>
<p>Pvt. Phillips' story is surely unique among soldiers. He went from deserter to hero in the space of a few months and for nearly a century almost everyone thought he was someone else. The military honored him with plaques and medals and even named a cargo ship for him, but all under a bogus name he had given the U.S. Marines â€” Harry Fisher.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century he fought in the Boxer Rebellion in China, where he was shot in the lung and died. He was the first Marine to be awarded the Medal of Honor after his death.</p>
<p>To the Marines he was Pvt. Harry Fisher, but in truth he was Franklin Phillips, a U.S. Army soldier who had enlisted in 1895 and fought in the Spanish-American War. He contracted malaria in Cuba and left his unit to go home after being refused a sick furlough, according to an account in the National Archives magazine Prologue.</p>
<p>Three months later, feeling better, he asked to rejoin his unit. The Army refused, according to a 1988 story in the Wall Street Journal, declaring him a deserter.</p>
<p>So in 1899 he joined the Marines under the name Harry Fisher and ended up in China, where the Marines had been dispatched to Peking to quell the Boxers. He was killed there on July 16, 1900, while helping to erect a barricade under heavy fire. He was 25.</p>
<p>The Medal of Honor was sent to his mother under the name Harry Fisher. She asked the Marines to change it to his real name. They would not, saying "no change can be made in a man's record after his death."</p>
<p>And so Franklin Phillips was laid to rest as Harry Fisher. Decades passed. Then, in the mid-1980s, Korean War veteran and history buff Wes Slusher of McKeesport was reading about Medal of Honor winners and found that there were no monuments or streets named for Harry Fisher, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>He convinced the local Moose Lodge to dedicate a bronze plaque in McKeesport.</p>
<p>In 1985 the story took a new turn. The Marines needed names for a fleet of cargo ships and decided on using Medal of Honor winners. One of the ships became the "Pvt. Harry Fisher."</p>
<p>That caught Mr. Slusher's attention, according to the Wall Street Journal, and he started checking for records for Harry Fisher in old newspapers. He didn't find any but did come across some stories about Franklin Phillips, who died the same day during the Boxer Rebellion. Mr. Slusher began writing letters to get to the bottom of the discrepancy and discovered that Franklin Phillips had enlisted under an assumed name.</p>
<p>A local campaign began to set the record straight, with McKeesport City Council and the state senate passing resolutions to recognize Franklin Phillips. KDKA also weighed in, vowing to honor a hometown hero.</p>
<p>By then, Harry Fisher's name was recognized in lots of places. It was painted on the side of the ship in huge white letters and stitched on the sailor's caps. There was a Harry Fisher scholarship for high school students, a monument at Presidio Army Base in San Francisco honoring the Marines killed in the Boxer Rebellion, a tree planted in his honor at Valley Forge and various other plaques at museums and halls.</p>
<p>The Marines initially resisted making the change.</p>
<p>But in 1988, the Corps relented and decided that Harry Fisher would from then on be Franklin Phillips.</p>
<p>A new Medal of Honor was presented that year and a headstone dedicated at McKeesport-Versailles Cemetery.</p>
<p>The medal citation reads: "For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty from 20 June 1900 to 16 July 1900. Private Phillips served in the presence of the enemy at the Battle of Peking, China. Assisting in the erection of barricades during the action, he was killed by the heavy enemy fire. By his courageous actions, indomitable spirit, and complete dedication to duty, Private Phillips reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country."</p>
<p>And the ship? The Military Sealift Command removed "Pvt. Harry Fisher" from the hull and painted in a new name: "Pvt. Franklin J. Phillips."</p>
