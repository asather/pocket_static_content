<h1>USA Today projects Pirates for 102 losses, worst NL record</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>We’ve reached February, which means spring training is on the horizon. That means plentiful predictions from pundits for the baseball season ahead, and at least one prominent national publication expects the Pirates to outright stink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>USA Today released its <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/02/04/mlb-2020-baseball-predictions-win-totals/4649827002/" target="_blank">projected win totals</a> for each MLB team Tuesday, and the Pirates were pegged for last place in the NL Central and a horrific 60-102 record by a panel of six experts, who summarized the division race this way:</p>
<p><em>For a division that figures to be volatile, our six NL Central ballots came back surprisingly identical: Cardinals-Reds-Brewers-Cubs-Pirates. Perhaps most jarring is the Cubs’ impending irrelevance: They’re pegged for a high of 83 wins and a low of 80. A moribund off-season after three years of gradual decay won’t win many caucuses. Meanwhile, the Reds’ winter flurry certainly garnered attention, though the player they acquired last July – right-hander Trevor Bauer, a free agent after this season – will likely have more say in their fate than $64 million men Mike Moustakas and Nick Castellanos. The biggest mystery: Do the Brewers have another rabbit in their hat? Don’t overlook the impact Keston Hiura’s .938 OPS might have over the course of an entire season. The Pirates might have made all the right moves in rebooting their baseball operations, but this may be their worst team since losing 105 games in 2010.</em></p>
<p>No National League teams were projected to be worse than the Pirates, though Baltimore (57-105) and Detroit (54-108) are expected to fare more poorly in the American League.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even on the heels of a 69-93 campaign, such a lack of national confidence in the club is pretty jarring. Its only significant losses this offseason were Starling Marte, who was traded to Arizona, and closer Felipe Vazquez, who’s in prison awaiting trial on a slew of child sex abuse charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combined, those two players were worth about five wins above replacement in 2018, so a bit of regression seems like a reasonable expectation. Nine additional losses seem like a lot, though, considering the Pirates were competitive in the division race as late as the All-Star break last summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That division isn’t expected to be very good either. USA Today has St. Louis winning it with just 88 wins, so it seems the Pirates should be able to benefit a bit from the NL Central’s mediocrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New York Yankees had the best projected record at 103-59. They’re expected to beat out Tampa Bay to win the AL East, while Minnesota (AL Central), Houston (AL West), Atlanta (NL East) and the Los Angeles Dodgers (NL West) were the other picks to win their divisions.&nbsp;</p>
