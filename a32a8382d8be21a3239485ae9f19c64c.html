<h1>Penguins won't ditch pregame 'sewer ball' despite 'freak accident' elsewhere</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>LAS VEGAS — Two hours before Tuesday’s 4-3 win over the Vegas Golden Knights, deep in the cold corridors inside T-Mobile Arena, a soccer ball and the loud voices of Penguins boomed off the walls near the visiting locker room.</p>
<p>Like most NHL teams, the Penguins have a group of players whose pregame ritual includes a game called two-touch soccer, or colloquially, “sewer ball.”</p>
<p>The players kick the ball at each other. The object of the game is to keep it in the air. They get two touches to corral it and pass it toward someone else. If you let it hit the ground, you’re out. So that pass could have some heat on it.</p>
<p>Games get competitive. Penguins can sometimes be heard hooting and hollering during Mike Sullivan’s pregame press scrums at PPG Paints Arena, forcing a team staffer to shut the double doors near their usual spot. But while the guys want to win this, too, the purpose is getting loose for that night’s real game.</p>
<p>“Sewer ball is meant to get you warmed up and get your hand-eye coordination going. We have guys that go hard,” Jared McCann said. “You have to stay focused. A guy can throw an absolute burger at you like [Bryan Rust] does to me every day. So I’ve got to be ready. I’ve got to control it and get it back to him.”</p>
<p>There have been stories of some NHL players going too hard, though.</p>
<p>The latest one involves New York Islanders defenseman Adam Pelech. Last week, he <a href="https://theathletic.com/1507245/2020/01/03/islanders-lose-adam-pelech-to-freak-warmup-injury-now-what/" target="_blank">suffered a season-ending Achilles injury</a> during pregame warm-ups. The Athletic reported that it is “believed” that it occurred during a two-touch game.</p>
<p>“Wow. I didn’t know that,” McCann said. “That’s why he’s out? That’s crazy.”</p>
<p>A few Penguins, including McCann, play a small game of two-touch about two hours before the opening faceoff. After the pregame team meeting, a larger group, sometimes including Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, plays.</p>
<p>Both McCann and Marcus Pettersson, two regulars in the early game that McCann called “the junior varsity” game, chalked Pelech’s injury up as a fluke and said they have no plans to eliminate it from their pregame routine.</p>
<p>“Obviously, it’s at the players’ discretion. We’re all grown men here,” McCann said. “You can get hurt warming up. You can get hurt doing anything. Sometimes, it just happens. It’s a freak accident. Obviously, I hope Adam’s OK.”</p>
<p>Pettersson said Penguins players, even though they sometimes work up a sweat during especially wild rallies, use common sense and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to warm up somehow. There’s a risk with everything you do,” Pettersson said. “It’s different than just sitting on a bike. … [NHL] games are very tense. It’s a way to loosen up and relax and have fun for a little bit and also get some competitiveness going, too, and get the spirit up a little bit.”</p>
<p><strong>Obligatory Crosby update</strong></p>
<p>Sullivan made Wednesday’s noon practice in Las Vegas optional for players. Only a handful skated. They included Crosby, Nick Bjugstad and Justin Schultz, who are working their way back from their respective injuries.</p>
<p>There appears to be a chance Crosby returns to the Penguins lineup during this trip. Practicing without contact restrictions Thursday in Denver would be a promising step. Bjugstad is not as close as him, but he’s ramping things up, too.</p>
<p>“He’s getting closer,” Sullivan said. “I’m reluctant to put time frames on these guys because there’s just so many things that influence [them]. But I will say we’re encouraged by Nick’s progress. We’re encouraged by all of the guys’ progress. We feel like they’re all getting closer. They’re visibly stronger on the ice.”</p>
<p>In a roster move that was likely related, the Penguins put forward Joseph Blandisi on waivers, which Sullivan said gives them more roster flexibility. Blandisi remains with the team for now. He was among those skating Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>Where will McCann wind up?</strong></p>
<p>McCann has played exclusively at center since Crosby went down in November. He has six goals, 14 points and a plus-1 rating in the 26 games since.</p>
<p>Sullivan said the Penguins have “really liked him at center.” But he said he’s not sure where McCann will wind up if the team ever gets relatively healthy.</p>
<p>“It all depends on … who’s in our lineup,” he said. “We feel like we’re pretty deep at [center] right now. The other thing with Jared is the question on where we’d like to play him in the lineup. Do we want to play him in the top six, for example? If that’s the case, then he’s more than likely going to play on the wing.”</p>
<p>Wherever McCann ends up skating, Sullivan thinks he’ll make an impact.</p>
<p>“He is a guy has the ability to be effective at both positions,” he said. “He’s been very good at [center]. He’s pretty good on faceoffs. But he’s also good on the wing. He brings a lot of speed, he can shoot the puck, he can score. So I just think it all depends on what the need is for the team at that particular time.”</p>
<p><strong>Blueger goes bucket-less</strong></p>
<p>Before Tuesday’s game, Teddy Blueger was the lone Penguins player to not wear a helmet in warm-ups. He explained that it was the result of a recent prank.</p>
<p>Thomas Di Pauli, who has since been sent to the minors, made his NHL debut in Saturday’s win in Montreal. Someone with the Penguins hid Di Pauli’s helmet, a popular prank pulled on rookies, and didn’t give it back until five minutes into pregame warm-ups. So Blueger said he’d go bucket-less, too.</p>
<p>That night, Blueger recorded two assists, including one on the winner.</p>
<p>“So I figured I’d stick with it,” said Blueger, who had another assist Tuesday.</p>
