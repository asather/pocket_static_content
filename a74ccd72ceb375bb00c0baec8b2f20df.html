<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh-area sports venues and gathering spaces are taking a wait-and-see approach to COVID-19.</p>
<p>• The Steelers told the Post-Gazette on Friday that they’ll confer with local experts and officials in deciding what precautions to take at Heinz Field in the days and weeks ahead. The team is in the middle of its offseason, but the stadium clubs are popular event spaces year-round.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Fan safety is our top priority. We have entered into preparations for the spring and summer season and are working with our partners at UPMC, as well as the local public health authorities to monitor any impact COVID-19 may have on the region,” a Heinz Field spokesman said. “We are staying informed of any new developments and will take appropriate precautionary measures and actions, as necessary, to ensure the safety and well-being of our fans.”</p>
<p>• The Penguins issued a similar statement Friday.</p>
<p>“The team is following the recommendations of the CDC, UPMC and the NHL,” the statement said. “Our medical staff has been in communication for several weeks with UPMC Infectious Disease about safety and prevention. The safety and health of our players, employees and fans are our first priority.”</p>
<p>• Earlier this week, the Pirates <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/03/04/pittsburgh-pirates-coronavirus-spring-training-florida/stories/202003040127" target="_blank">sanitized their spring training facilities</a> in Bradenton, Fla., after a COVID-19&nbsp;case was reported nearby. Their athletic trainer said they’re working collaboratively with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the baseball commissioner’s office on possible further measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Riverhounds SC, meanwhile, said they’ve worked with the United Soccer League Championship to develop protocols that they’ll implement at Highmark Stadium if and when the need arises. For now, they’re preceding normally and not commenting on what those protocols might be. The team’s home opener against Louisville is set for March 21.</p>
<p>• Robert Morris University’s athletic events and other campus gatherings will continue as scheduled. Jonathan Potts, vice president for public relations and marketing, said the school is monitoring the situation for now while remaining in close contact with its athletic conferences’ offices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The University of Pittsburgh, likewise said in a statement that there are no immediate plans to limit events on campus. The university is set to play host to the ACC wrestling championships at Petersen Events Center this weekend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Area malls including Ross Park, South Hills Village and the Galleria of Mt. Lebanon deferred comment to their management groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The health and well-being of our employees, retailers and customers is a top priority,” said Stacey Keating, a spokeswoman for CBL Properties, which manages Monroeville Mall. “We are closely monitoring the situation in our area, have contacted the local health department and will maintain open lines of communication as the situation evolves. We are working with our service providers to ensure thorough cleaning and sanitizing of high traffic common areas with the appropriate cleaning agents. We have placed hand sanitizer units throughout the property and recommend that employees and customers follow appropriate CDC guidelines.”</p>
<p>Officials with the Galleria at Pittsburgh Mills said they were taking similar steps. The Mall at Robinson could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, which manages several local theaters and event spaces, said it plans to continue its events as scheduled as well, though it has taken some precautions.</p>
<p>“We have informed our staff, volunteers, and artists of best practices to minimizing risk and have implemented enhanced environmental cleaning to provide the safest environment possible,” president and CEO Kevin McMahon said in the statement. “We will continue to follow the advice of health authorities and implement measures as necessary with the understanding that the safety of our staff and guests is of paramount importance.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Tim Muldoon, general manager of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, said the Pittsburgh Home &amp; Garden show will go on as planned starting this weekend. Signs promoting best practices have been posted around the building, and custodial staff will be taking extra measures to sanitize&nbsp;“touch points,” such as concession stands and the box office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Officials with Stage AE, PPG Paints Arena and the Washington Wild Things could not be reached for comment Friday.</p>
<p>More than 93,000 of COVID-19, a new coronavirus, and upward of 3,200 deaths have been reported, in as many as 60 countries, beginning in China. In the U.S., 12 deaths have been reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most COVID-19 cases are mild; some cases are fatal, especially among the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions.</p>
