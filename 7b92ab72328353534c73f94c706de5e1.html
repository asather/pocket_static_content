<h1>Predicting the future is folly, but here are our Emmy picks anyway</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Stipulated: “Watchmen” will win the Emmy Award for best limited series and Regina King, its indomitable center, will be honored at Sunday’s largely virtual ceremony hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.</p>
<p>Most everything else about the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards is a question mark, including how smoothly the pandemic-constrained telecast (8 p.m. ABC) will unfold.</p>
<p>The show’s producers were still working out their final strategy this week as the TV industry’s big night nears. But housebound nominees, formally dressed or not, will be poised to go live on-screen and discover whether they’ve won or lost.&nbsp;The potential for glitches alone will provide suspense, but so will the honors. With the coronavirus turning so many of us into morose shut-ins, the small screen’s wealth of shows and performances has provided a key distraction.</p>
<p>TV academy voters have a chance to reward the best of the best and to recognize change. The streaming-induced growth of content opened doors to more trophy-worthy projects from those too often ignored, including people of color and women.&nbsp;Against that backdrop, we offer our predictions in the top categories, but accept zero blame for virtual office-pool betting losses.</p>
<p><strong>Drama series</strong></p>
<p>Nominees: “Better Call Saul”; “The Crown”; “Killing Eve”; “The Handmaid’s Tale”; “The Mandalorian”; “Ozark”; “Stranger Things”; “Succession.”</p>
<p>Should win: “Ozark” or&nbsp;“The Crown.” Like the much-honored “Breaking Bad,” “Ozark” is a morality play woven out of family dysfunction and brutal criminality, masterfully written and acted. The writing and acting are consistently superb in&nbsp;“The Crown,” too. Last season was quirky, ranging from Prince Charles awkwardly learning Welsh to the way it handled a disaster in a coal-mining town.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will win: “Succession.” A brassy, sexy power struggle that has the scope Emmy voters expect from a top drama, with bonus points for its au courant media empire setting.&nbsp;Think of this show as an American version of “The Crown,” except we do our successions noisily and arrogantly and the Brits do it by blood and far more elegantly.</p>
<p><strong>Comedy series</strong></p>
<p>Nominees: “Curb Your Enthusiasm”; “Dead to Me”; “The Good Place”; “Insecure”; “The Kominsky Method”; “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”; “Schitt’s Creek”; “What We Do in the Shadows.”</p>
<p>Should win: “Schitt’s Creek.” It’s silly, loving and open-minded. Can’t we all use that good medicine now?</p>
<p>Will win: “Schitt’s Creek.” No way I would have said so before last year’s surprise (and far worthier) “Fleabag” victory, but Emmy voters have a soft spot for idiosyncrasy.&nbsp;In a weak category this year with lots of one-trick ponies and repetitive skits, this fish-out-of-water show is the only one really beloved by voters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actor, drama series</strong></p>
<p>Nominees: Jason Bateman, “Ozark”; Sterling K. Brown, “This is Us”; Billy Porter, “Pose”; Jeremy Strong, “Succession”; Brian Cox, “Succession”; Steve Carell, “The Morning Show.”</p>
<p>Should win: Billy Porter or Steve Carell. Porter’s victory last year, as the first openly gay man to be honored as best drama actor, was both historic and artistic. He deserves it again. Though&nbsp;Carell and Bateman both showed, again, that in addition to having huge comedy chops, they are excellent dramatic actors, I give the edge to Carell, who adds a ferociousness to his disgraced character.</p>
<p>Will win: Jeremy Strong. His&nbsp;hangdog, needy and slightly dim bro role in “Succession” is exactly what we need right now. Strong’s emotional tapdance as the wannabe heir is worthy, but I’ll use my caveat chit here: He and Cox could split the “Succession” vote, giving gear-shifting Carell an opening.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actress, drama series</strong></p>
<p>Nominees: Jennifer Aniston, “The Morning Show”; Olivia Colman, “The Crown”; Jodie Comer, “Killing Eve”; Laura Linney, “Ozark”; Sandra Oh, “Killing Eve”; Zendaya, “Euphoria.”</p>
<p>Should win: Laura Linney or Zendaya. Linney, an actor of impeccable subtlety, gets to sink her teeth into a deeply flawed character in&nbsp;“Ozark.” In “Euphoria,” Zendaya is simply remarkable.</p>
<p>Will win: Laura Linney.&nbsp;One of the most underappreciated actors working today, she lost out last year to Jodie Comer. But this season of “Ozark” was her showcase and she’ll prevail despite an impressive field that includes Jennifer Aniston in an against-type role.</p>
<p><strong>Actor, comedy series</strong></p>
<p>Nominees: Anthony Anderson, “black-ish”; Don Cheadle, “Black Monday”; Ted Danson, “The Good Place”; Michael Douglas, “The Kominsky Method”; Eugene Levy, “Schitt’s Creek”; Ramy Youssef, “Ramy.”</p>
<p>Should win: Ted Danson or Anthony Anderson. Dying is easy, comedy is hard — except to Danson, an effortless master of the sitcom, whether based in a bar (“Cheers”) or the afterlife.&nbsp;Anderson has never won an acting Emmy for “black-ish” and that’s not cool. His blustery, stubborn and yet entirely sweet patriarch is the center of the show.</p>
<p>Will win: Eugene Levy. He’s playing new notes in his longstanding, finely tuned comedic partnership with co-star Catherine O’Hara, and it will pay off.&nbsp;He simply has the most expressive eyebrows on TV.</p>
<p><strong>Actress, comedy series</strong></p>
<p>Nominees: Christina Applegate, “Dead to Me”; Rachel Brosnahan, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”; Linda Cardellini, “Dead to Me”; Catherine O’Hara, “Schitt’s Creek”; Issa Rae, “Insecure”; Tracee Ellis Ross, “black-ish.”</p>
<p>Should win: Catherine O’Hara or Issa Rae. O’Hara’s delectably self-absorbed, absurd Moira stands atop a Mount Rushmore of her inventive portrayals. Rae’s work as creator and star of&nbsp;HBO’s “Insecure” also needs to be celebrated.</p>
<p>Will win: Catherine O’Hara. Resistance is futile, Emmy, despite perhaps the strongest of all fields this year. You belong to her.</p>
<p><strong>Limited series</strong></p>
<p>Nominees: “Little Fires Everywhere”; “Mrs. America”; “Unbelievable”; ”Unorthodox”; “Watchmen.”</p>
<p>Should win: “Watchmen.” This ambitious interpretation of a highly regarded graphic novel is prescient in its connection with today’s bleak zeitgeist.&nbsp;“Watchmen” has&nbsp;bold, complex storytelling, but it may be a little too enigmatic for a mainstream audience. A warning was that it earned not even a single Golden Globe nod.</p>
<p>Will win: “Watchmen.” While second-wave feminist history “Mrs. America” is worthy competition, the daring and currency of “Watchmen” is insurmountable. However,&nbsp;“Little Fires Everywhere,” in a surprise, could pull it out. That show ruthlessly explored class, race, privilege and separated families — how very, very 2020.</p>
