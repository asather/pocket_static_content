<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A bill that would authorize the Citizen Police Review Board to hire an outside firm to review what happened during a June 1 protest in East Liberty failed Tuesday in a close vote in Pittsburgh City Council.</p>
<p>The 5-4 vote denies <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/06/18/Pittsburgh-Citizen-Police-Review-Board-bill-Densus-Group-protests-use-of-force/stories/202006180148" target="_blank">a $25,000 contract with the Plano, Texas-based Densus Group</a>, a U.S.- and U.K.-veteran run consultant group that specializes in protest management and was “founded to advocate the professional and appropriate use of force,” according to its website.</p>
<p>Densus’ major clients include the U.S. departments of Defense, Justice and State.</p>
<p>Council members Ricky Burgess, Anthony Coghill, Deb Gross, Erika Strassburger and Theresa Kail-Smith, council president, voted to block the contract going forward. Members Corey O’Connor, Bobby Wilson, Daniel Lavelle, chair of the Public Safety Committee, and Bruce Kraus, who sponsored the bill, voted to allow the contract.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency declaration</strong></p>
<p>Council unanimously voted to extend the city’s declaration of disaster emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The governing body must vote every seven days to continue the declaration’s status.
