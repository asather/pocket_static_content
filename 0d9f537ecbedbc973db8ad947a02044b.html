<h1>Hunting license sales are up, triggered by change in deer season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three decades of free fall in the sale of Pennsylvania hunting licenses may have been reversed by last year’s controversial change in the opening day of the statewide firearm deer season.</p>
<p>At 2020’s first quarterly meeting of the state Game Commission Jan. 24, board members heard evidence that hunting license sales from July through December 2019 had increased 0.4% to 849,575, an increase of 3,351 licenses. The hunting license season runs from July through June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, hunters ages 18 to 34 were among those who bought licenses at the highest rate in the days leading up to the state’s primary two-week antlered deer season, suggesting they had taken advantage of the Nov. 30 date, in many cases a no-school, no-work Saturday.</p>
<p>“It seems reasonable to conclude the Saturday opener had an influence on this turnaround,” said Game Commission spokesman Travis Lau, two days before the board meeting.</p>
<p>Bryan Burhans, Game Commission executive director, said in a statement the much-anticipated license sales report may signal the strategy was successful.</p>
<p>“In this day and age, where people lead busy lifestyles and many hunters who drop from the ranks do so because they can’t find the time to hunt, creating opportunity might be the biggest key in keeping hunters active to carry on our traditions and maintain strong wildlife populations,” he said.</p>
<p>In the 2018-19 license year, about 850,000 hunting licenses were sold — some 500,000 were basic adult resident licenses. Another 42 license types, plus 10 kinds of optional permits, are sold. The $29.90 cost of an adult resident license, a fee controlled by the state legislature, has remained unchanged since 1999.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hunting license sales fund 40% of the Game Commission’s annual $100 million budget. The agency controls a supplemental reserve of about $50 million. Additional funding comes from federal excise taxes on purchases of guns and ammunition, leases on Game Commission properties and a reapportionment formula based on the number of Pennsylvania hunting licenses sold per year. A semi-autonomous extension of the Commonwealth’s executive branch, the agency&nbsp;receives no support from general tax funds to pay for the costs of wildlife management.</p>
<p>Game Commission data shows license sales have trended downward for more than 30 years, dropping by an average of 3% annually and mirroring similar declines nationally. From the 2017-18 license year through 2018-19, Pennsylvania sales dipped another 3.4%, indicating the loss of more than 30,000 hunters. An agency statement said that if the Saturday opener helped to reverse the losses and actually increased license sales, “[the strategy] might have kept afield more than 28,000 hunters who otherwise wouldn’t have hunted.”</p>
<p>License sales to resident hunters ages 18 to 34 increased by 0.56%. During the week leading up to Nov. 30, those hunters purchased 20,242 licenses, an increase of more than 7% for this age group compared to the same time period in 2018. At the younger end of that spectrum, college-age hunters from 18 to 21 years old bought 45,000 licenses, a 2.4% increase. In the seven days before the Saturday start, they purchased 5,311 hunting licenses, an 18.4% increase compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The opening day of deer season had been held on the Monday following Thanksgiving since 1963. Many hunters, particularly those who traditionally hunt from camps, opposed the change to Saturday. Information surfaced last week citing financial losses at some businesses attributed to the absence of a Monday opener.</p>
<p>Mr. Lau said he believes hunter opposition to the Saturday start has been exaggerated.</p>
<p>“I have seen some folks portray the Saturday opener as something hunters did not and do not want. The time I’ve spent talking with hunters from across the state [and] reading their comments on online forums … leads me to believe this is a complete misrepresentation,” he said. “The sale of 2019-20 licenses will continue through June 30, so the final figure for the license year remains to be seen. But the fact that sales are positioned to increase, and to date have increased, is positive news from the Game Commission’s perspective.”</p>
<p>A preliminary listing of 2020-21 hunting seasons and bag limits presented at the Jan. 24 meeting shows a Saturday opening of the firearm deer season Nov. 29 followed by a day of legal Sunday hunting, the first in Pennsylvania since early in the British rule of Penn’s Colony. Late last year the state legislature approved three days of Sunday hunting mandating that one be held three days after Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The Game Commission board is expected to hold a final vote on the Saturday start of deer season at its next quarterly meeting.</p>
