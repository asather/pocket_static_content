<h1>Trump threatens to force Congress to adjourn so he can make recess appointments</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Wednesday invoked the possibility of taking the extraordinary act of forcing an adjournment of Congress in order to make recess appointments.</p>
<p>The president called the use of pro forma sessions — gaveling the Senate in and out once every three days to fulfill the constitutional requirement for convening — while blocking recess appointments to Senate-confirmed positions a “scam.”</p>
<p>Speaking at a daily press briefing with members of the coronavirus task force, Trump said that he needed positions requiring Senate confirmation filled in relation to the response to the current pandemic.</p>

<p>“The Senate’s practice of gaveling into so-called pro forma sessions when no one is even there has prevented me from using the constitutional authority that we’re given under the recess provisions,” the president said in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. “The Senate should either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees or it should formally adjourn so that I can make recess appointments.”</p>
<p>Adjournment resolutions must be adopted by both chambers of Congress, and with Speaker Nancy Pelosi leading a Democratic-controlled House, it is almost unthinkable that such a resolution would be adopted there.</p>
<p>“If the House will not agree to that adjournment, I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress,” Trump said. “The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony pro forma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis.”</p>
<p>Trump, as he sought to explain his consideration of the action, took special note of Michael Pack, the President's choice to lead the Broadcasting Board of Governors, whose organization doesn't hold a clear role in the federal government's coronavirus health or economic response.</p>
<p>Trump cited Pack's stalled nomination to head the board of Voice of America as a particular grievance, and went on to attack the news organization.</p>
<p>"He's been stuck in committee for two years, preventing us from managing the Voice of America, very important. And if you've heard what's coming out of the Voice of America, it's disgusting. The things they say are disgusting toward our country," Trump said of Pack.</p>
<p>Trump did not explain how the nominee to be CEO of the US Agency for Global Media would enhance federal efforts to counter the pandemic.</p>
<p>But he reiterated his threat to adjourn both chambers of Congress several times.</p>
<p>"If they don't approve it, we're gonna go this route," Trump said. "We are going to do something that will be something I prefer not doing."</p>
<p>No president has ever forced Congress to adjourn when the two chambers fail to reach consensus on adjournment, but the power does exist under the Constitution.</p>
<p>If the House and Senate disagree on the time of adjournment, the Constitution says that the president may “adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper.”</p>
<p>Given that the authority has never been invoked before, it's murky as to what would define "disagreement" in this case.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky&nbsp;would likely have to bring senators back to Washington to vote to adjourn in order to create the "disagreement" cited in the Constitution that would provide the grounds for Trump to act.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has been clear on the validity of the pro forma sessions that Trump referred to as a scam, siding with the interpretation of Senate Republicans over then-President Barack Obama back in 2014.</p>
<p>“For purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says that it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business,” the Court held in NLRB v. Noel Canning, which contested the validity of actions taken by the National Labor Relations Board with members ostensibly installed by Obama’s recess appointments.</p>
<p>With a Republican majority in the Senate, it was ultimately the decision of McConnell that it was best to not keep the Senate in session conducting debate-limiting cloture votes on Trump nominees during the health crisis.</p>
<p>The decision to stay away from Washington until May 4 was made, and announced, by McConnell, a close Trump ally.</p>
<p>A McConnell spokesman said Trump and McConnell spoke about the issue on Wednesday: "The Leader pledged to find ways to confirm nominees considered mission-critical to the Covid-19 pandemic, but under Senate rules that will take consent from&nbsp;[Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer."</p>
<p>In that last point, McConnell was seen as saying any solution to the confirmation issue will require Democratic consent.</p>
