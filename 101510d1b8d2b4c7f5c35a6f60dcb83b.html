<h1>Dan DeRose, North Allegheny’s new boys basketball coach, is talking championship</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dan DeRose fancies himself as a basketball coach who likes challenges. That’s one of the main reasons he decided to leave Penn Hills and become the new boys coach at North Allegheny.</p>
<p>The North Allegheny school board officially hired DeRose Wednesday night, and one of DeRose’s biggest objectives for his new job is to give North Allegheny something it has never had.</p>
<p>“I’m a guy that likes challenges,” DeRose said. “The fact that North Allegheny has never won a WPIAL boys championship is something that is motivation to me. I would like to possibly be a part of their first one. I like to bring joy and excitement to people. That’s what attracted me to Penn Hills. Their program was down and I wanted to go in there and rejuvenate it and bring some joy to the program. I want to do that at North Allegheny.”</p>
<p>DeRose, 54, said it was a “tough” decision to leave Penn Hills. In five years, he had a 100-26 record and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2018/03/03/Daivon-Stephens-Cory-Fulton-Penn-Hills-victory-WPIAL-championship-Pine-Richland/stories/201803030110" target="_blank">won the WPIAL Class 6A championship</a> in 2018. Penn Hills is now in Class 5A and, with a number of returning players, the Indians are expected to challenge for a WPIAL title next year. The North Allegheny job is a high-profile position in WPIAL boys basketball.</p>
<p>“There are a number of reasons I took [the North Allegheny job],” DeRose said. “Distance is one. I live two miles away from the school. That drive to Penn Hills all the time will wear on you. Plus, North Allegheny is one of the biggest schools in the state and now I’m back in Class 6A basketball. That’s attractive to me.</p>
<p>“One of the other reasons is [North Allegheny athletic director] Bob Bozzuto. I think he’s one of, if not the best, athletic director in the WPIAL. I’ve known him for a while and he’s been a guy who has helped me in the past.”</p>
<p>North Allegheny made the WPIAL playoffs in three of Keith Noftz’s four years as coach. But the Tigers did not win a playoff game and Noftz resigned after this past season.</p>
<p>North Allegheny is the largest high school in the WPIAL in terms of enrollment and the school has won many WPIAL titles in numerous other sports. But the Tigers have lost in their only three WPIAL boys basketball championship games — 1995 and ’99 under coach Mark Jula, and 2016 under Dave DeGregorio.</p>
<p>DeRose is a little familiar with the North Allegheny program. He spent two years as a middle school coach in the district before leaving to take the South Park job in 2014. DeRose became Penn Hills’ coach in 2015.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge at North Allegheny is retention of players,” DeRose said. “How do you keep the good players in the district from leaving and going to private schools? I think that’s been an issue in the past because maybe the program hasn’t been one of the top programs at the school and maybe they’ve also lost some kids to volleyball or other sports. But they’ve also lost kids to private schools. Maybe they haven’t gotten the talented players to stay there.”</p>
<p>Before coaching high school, DeRose also spent a decade as a head coach on the college level. He coached at Community College of Beaver County for six years, Penn State McKeesport for three and Chowan (N.C.) for two.</p>
<p>DeRose has a system that he prefers to run, no matter the level. He likes to have teams play full-court pressure defense and also run many set plays on offense. Once when he was at Penn Hills, he said his team had <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/highschool/2016/02/23/Playing-by-the-book/stories/201602220142" target="_blank">40 offensive sets to run</a>, not counting out-of-bounds plays.</p>
<p>“Obviously, you might have to make a few adjustments, but I’m a firm believer in that no matter where I’ve been and what players I had, [the system] has worked,” DeRose said. “How you teach it, instruct it and getting kids to buy in is the biggest reason for the success.”</p>
<p>DeRose said he has not decided on assistant coaches yet and did not want to think about assistants until he was officially hired.</p>
