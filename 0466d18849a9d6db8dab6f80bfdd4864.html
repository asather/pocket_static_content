<h1>Dwight Hines, former Aliquippa boys basketball coach, hired at Sto-Rox</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Here’s one for the strange but true WPIAL basketball coaching situations.</p>
<p>A coach leads his team to a WPIAL championship game, but it’s not enough to stop the school from opening his position a few months later.</p>
<p>Then the school goes out and hires a coach who was let go from his job in June, despite guiding his team to the WPIAL semifinals the past three years.</p>
<p>This is the story of Sto-Rox boys basketball, Ryan Hughes and Dwight Hines.</p>
<p>Sto-Rox hired Hines as its coach Thursday night. Hines was Aliquippa’s coach the past four years and had three WPIAL semifinal appearances, but that apparently wasn’t enough for him to keep his job.</p>
<p>Hines takes over at Sto-Rox for Hughes, who guided the Vikings to the WPIAL Class 2A title game this past season. Apparently that wasn’t enough for Hughes to keep his job.</p>
<p>But Hughes’ job wasn’t the only one opened in June because the Sto-Rox school board opened all coaching positions except football coach. That was done at the same time Sto-Rox hired LaRoi Johnson as athletic director. Johnson is the school’s football coach.</p>
<p>But Hines wasn’t the only hire made by Sto-Rox Thursday. Kerry Connolly was named the new girls basketball coach for the Vikings. Connolly is a former standout player at Sto-Rox who scored more than 1,000 career points.</p>
