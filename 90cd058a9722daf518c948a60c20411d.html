<h1>Buying Here: Father-daughter team transforms a Carrick house and prices it under $165,000</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Flipping houses sometimes has a bad connotation, with prospective buyers wondering what’s hiding under the fresh paint, dropped ceilings and new floors. That’s not the case when Stacey Hollis and her father, James, do it. And&nbsp;<strong>309 E. Agnew</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Ave.</strong> in Carrick, their second project together, is a perfect example.</p>
<p>The three-bedroom, one-bath home on the border with Baldwin Borough is on the market for $164,900 (MLS No. 1458469) with Phat Nguyen of Coldwell Banker Real Estate (<a href="https://www.coldwellbankerhomes.com/pa/pittsburgh/309-e-agnew/pid_37270897/" target="_blank">www.coldwellbanker.com</a> or 412-877-9188). The property, which is listed as contingent, is open by appointment in accordance with COVID-19 guidelines.</p>
<p>Built in 1915, the 1,400-square-foot red-brick house has original woodwork, stained-glass windows, exposed fireplaces, front and back porches and a shiny new kitchen. There’s even a 12-foot-ceiling in the basement.</p>
<p>Ms. Hollis, 27, is a new mom with an eye for design and a contractor in the family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He was always working on houses,” she said. “He was driving a concrete truck and decided to finally open a business. We do all of our work together.”</p>
<p>She said the biggest challenge for their company, J2 Home Improvements, was flipping a house during a pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We worked hard to be able to finish it with so much on lockdown....&nbsp;We opened up some walls and made it more of an open concept.”</p>
<p>Inside, original features include stair banisters, stained-glass windows and decorative brick fireplaces in the living room and dining room. The Hollises installed new lantern-style and recessed LED lighting and vinyl-plank floors on the first floor.&nbsp;The white-on-white color scheme makes each space feel large and bright.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, the team went with white Shaker-style cabinets, brushed-nickel hardware, white quartz counters and a honed marble backsplash. The stainless-steel appliances&nbsp;include a dishwasher, microwave/exhaust combo, refrigerator and dishwasher. An undermount stainless-steel sink sits under a window and a 15-light glass door leads to the rear deck.</p>
<p>The second floor has three bedrooms, all with gray carpet.&nbsp;The two largest bedrooms have exposed-brick fireplaces and enlarged closets with mirrored doors.</p>
<p>“My dad expanded them and built shelving and hanging space,” Ms. Hollis said.</p>
<p>The smallest bedroom has been staged as a home office.</p>
<p>The full bathroom features white porcelain-tile floors and shower walls with a gray vein. A pull-down ladder accesses the attic, where two windows provide cross ventilation.</p>
<p>The partially covered rear deck&nbsp;spans the width of the home and offers space for dining and grilling. The Hollises added a&nbsp;new parking pad and side steps that lead to the fenced-in backyard.</p>
<p>The walkout basement has a high ceiling, oversized beams, gray floors, a new boiler and laundry hookups.</p>
<p>“I love the basement. It would make an awesome finished space,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Hollis noted that the electrical system has been updated.</p>
<p>“We had the radiator covers custom-made,” she noted.</p>
<p>The property’s assessed value is $52,100. Over the last two years, six houses have sold in the 300 block of East Agnew Avenue for prices ranging from $42,000 in July 2020 to $134,900 in June 2019 (<a href="http://www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/GeneralInfo.aspx" target="_blank">www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/GeneralInfo.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>The neighborhood, which is in the Pittsburgh Public School District, has lots of families, Ms. Hollis said.</p>
<p>“We are doing more of these. I’m on the hunt for my next flip.”</p>
