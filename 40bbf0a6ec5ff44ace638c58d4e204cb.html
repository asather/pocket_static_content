<p>Less than two minutes before Ericka J. Stevens was shot in the face Thursday while sitting in a car outside a McKeesport bar, police said that her accused killer bashed her in the head with a nearly full Corona beer bottle inside the tavern.</p>
<p>With police on their way because of the unruly crowd and a melee that was out of control, Ms. Stevens and her alleged attacker, Gabrielle Parker, left the McKeesport Beer Barrel.</p>
<p>Around 1:41 a.m., as people milled about outside on 5th Avenue, Ms. Parker got into a car driven by a female friend, who handed her a gun, and cracked off several shots, police said. One of them struck Ms. Stevens in the face; she was pronounced dead 12 minutes later, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Detectives said they identified Ms. Parker, 33, as the shooter through the help of a witness, information from the car owner's sister and the bar's extensive video surveillance system.</p>
<p>An arrest warrant was issued Saturday for Ms. Parker, who frequents McKeesport. She is charged with homicide, criminal conspiracy and firearms not to be carried without a license.</p>
<p>Police did not say what the argument inside the bar was about. Both Ms. Stevens, 29, and her boyfriend were involved, the complaint said.</p>
<p>The unnamed witness was outside the bar just before the shooting and was told by Ms. Parker, an acquaintance, to "get out of here," the complaint said. The witness told police that Ms. Parker got into a car, which pulled out from a spot in front of the bar and headed east on 5th Avenue.</p>
<p>Someone in the car then fired multiple shots at a black vehicle parked across from the tavern, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Investigators said that video surveillance filled in the blanks in the story.</p>
<p>The camera system showed Ms. Parker, wearing camouflage pants and a sleeveless black shirt, speaking to the confidential witness moments before the shooting and then getting into the car.</p>
<p>Detectives zoomed in on the car's license plate and were able to track it to a woman in Dravosburg, police said.</p>
<p>Just before the shooting, police said a woman identified in the complaint only as Female 1 stood outside the car holding a gun, got into the driver's seat and passed the gun to Ms. Parker, who sat in the front passenger seat, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Investigators recovered five spent shell casings from the scene. All had the same caliber -- 9 mm -- just like the bullet that killed Ms. Stevens, police said.</p>
<p>Police noted in the complaint that records show that in February, the Dravosburg car owner bought a 9 mm handgun.</p>
<p>In the hours after the shooting, detectives went to the woman's house. The car was parked in the area, police said. The woman was not there, but her sister was. When she let police in, a detective found an empty gun box in the woman's bedroom, the complaint said.</p>
<p>After executing a search warrant, police found ammunition, but no gun.</p>
<p>Asked Saturday whether the woman faced charges in connection with Ms. Stevens' death, county homicide Lt. Venerando Costa said, "We are working with the DA's [district attorney's] office."</p>
