<h1>Pittsburgh reports 'severe' dip in revenues</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The City of Pittsburgh’s revenues dropped by 25% since March compared to the same time last year, according to city budget officials.</p>
<p>From March to May 8, the city pulled in&nbsp;$94,401,623 compared with $126,398,602 in 2019.</p>
<p>The Office of Budget and Management also reports that the city has decreased spending by 7% since March.</p>
<p>Spending dropped to&nbsp;$101,542,050 from&nbsp;$109,253,127 during the same time period last year.</p>
<p>“The city is holding its own through frugal spending but the gaps between our revenues and expenditures are likely to widen further,” Mayor Bill Peduto said in a press release. “With the help of city council and the leaders of all city departments we will have to keep a hard watch on spending until the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic become clearer.”</p>
<p>Corresponding updated revenue and expenditure reports from the city controller’s office are not yet available.</p>
