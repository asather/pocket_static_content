<h1>Charleroi police officer suspended, charged after stealing pills and money from stolen vehicle</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An officer from the Charleroi Regional Police Department has been charged and suspended after authorities say he stole oxycontin pills and $47 from a stolen vehicle, and violated department protocol by not logging the items into evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police allege 39-year-old William Gardner, of Fayette, was on duty March 27 when he stole evidence while responding to reports of a suspicious vehicle in the Charleroi borough of Washington County. He followed police procedure and entered the car into inventory, but then broke protocol by stealing an undisclosed amount of placebo oxycontin tablets and $47 from the vehicle without listing it as evidence, the criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>His final report about the vehicle made no mention of the pills or the money, the criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardner is charged with possession of a controlled substance, obstruction of administrative law, tampering with physical evidence, receiving stolen property and theft from a motor vehicle. He was set to be arraigned before District Judge&nbsp;Michael L. Manfredi on Tuesday afternoon, court dockets show.</p>
<p>In an interview with state police on March 30, Mr. Gardner admitted he took the items while searching the vehicle. He also admitted that he failed to place the items into evidence as required by his department’s procedures. He said he threw the pills away after deciding he no longer wanted them at the end of his shift, but he did not say what he did with the money, the criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardner was placed on administrative leave March 30 and will remain on leave as the investigation and filing of criminal charges progresses, according to Todd Pappasergi, solicitor of the Charleroi Regional Police Boards.</p>
<p>State police had been investigating the officer for his involvement in narcotics trafficking as far back as January, when his name and phone number turned up in the phone of a person who had overdosed on drugs. Police learned Mr. Gardner — who was listed as “Billy Billy” in the victim’s phone —&nbsp;was a friend of the victim and the two had discussed setting up drug transactions in several text messages police found in the victim’s phone, the criminal complaint said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The messages indicated Mr. Gardner “was purchasing prescription medication from the deceased on a routine basis,” police said in the complaint.</p>
<p>Family of the victim identified Mr. Gardner as an officer who often spent time at the victim’s home. A warrant search of the victim’s phone confirmed Mr. Gardner’s phone number, police said.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for May 18.</p>
