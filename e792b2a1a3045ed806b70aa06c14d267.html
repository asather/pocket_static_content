<h1>Surge of COVID-19-related jobless claims in Pennsylvania could strain state's system </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On Thursday, Pennsylvania reported there were 378,900 new claims for unemployment benefits last week — six times the highest previous number on record — reflecting the stunning number of residents thrown out of work due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak, the highest number of first-time claims in the state was 61,181, which was recorded in January 2010, according to U.S. Labor Department figures. The data date back to 1987.</p>

<p>The latest figures accounted for the most new claims of any U.S. state, including the epicenter of the pandemic, New York, which reported 80,300. Nationwide, nearly 3.3 million Americans applied for jobless benefits last week, more than quadruple the previous record set in 1982. Federal records date back to 1967.</p>
<p>With the crush of new claims — Gov. Tom Wolf first ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses on March 16 — some are concerned about the ability of Pennsylvania's system to handle the sudden influx.</p>
<p>The state <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2014/08/02/Commonwealth-extends-pact-with-CMU/stories/201408020043?cid=search" target="_blank">has struggled</a> in recent years with the need to make upgrades to the computer system it uses for unemployment claims, and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2017/01/20/Pennsylvania-unemployment-workers-call-on-legislators-for-funding/stories/201701200068" target="_blank">a political dispute over funding the upgrades</a> led to two call centers in Lancaster and Altoona being shuttered several years ago.</p>
<p>"We've never gotten back to the same numbers of people working in the system we have from three years ago," said Steve Catanese, the president of the Service Employees International Union Local 668, which represents workers at the centers.</p>

<p>The state has six call centers, one in Duquesne, and others in Altoona, Erie, Harrisburg, Indiana and Scranton.</p>
<p>When asked if the state was hiring more workers to process claims, a spokeswoman said needs were still being evaluated.</p>
<p>"We are working quickly to bolster our UC operations during this unprecedented time, while serving our customers as effectively and efficiently as possible," said Penny Ickes, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry.</p>
<p>"We are evaluating staffing needs, but first must ensure that our operations strictly adhere to the social distancing and other mitigation efforts in Pennsylvania and around the country. We must keep our employees safe and healthy, so that they can continue to help as many COVID-impacted workers as possible."</p>
<p>Those assisting callers have been working hard and volunteering to take on extra work, said Mr. Catanese. They “see the numbers and know how much of a crisis it is going to be, so they want to step up,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Catanese said he's hoping federal legislation will waive some of the more onerous requirements that apply to those filing unemployment claims under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, legislators in Harrisburg approved a bill to make temporary changes aimed at easing some requirements for both workers and employers.</p>
<p>House Bill 68 would eliminate a waiting period and waive normal job search requirements. It was approved unanimously by both chambers and is headed to the governor.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>Despite the high volume of claims, Julia Simon-Mishel, supervising attorney in the unemployment compensation unit of Philadelphia Legal Assistance, said she doesn’t want anyone to be scared off from filing a claim.</p>
<p>“Despite any challenges they might face, we recommend that people just get their applications in,” she said.</p>
<p>Barney Oursler, who leads the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2018/12/02/Four-decades-of-fighting-for-labor-rights-a-white-haired-organizer-comes-back-to-where-he-started/stories/201812020002" target="_blank">advocacy organization Mon Valley Unemployed Committee</a>, has been advising those seeking to file claims in recent days to avoid the jammed phone lines and<a href="https://www.uc.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"> apply online</a>.</p>
<p>“The <a href="https://www.uc.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">online thing is better</a>&nbsp;set up than it used to be. For most people, that works,” he said.</p>
<p>He acknowledges that's hard right now for anyone without internet access at home, particularly with libraries closed.</p>
<p>“For people who don't have a computer ... they're really, really screwed,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Oursler's organization dates back to the early 1980s and traces its roots to the devastating mass layoffs of thousands of steelworkers in the region during that time.</p>
<p>But the layoffs he's seeing now?</p>
<p>“There's never been anything like this,” he said.</p>
<p>Even in the 1980s, “when workplaces were closing, they didn't all close at once.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the state’s jobless claims continue to pile up.</p>
<p>Another 271,067 were filed from Sunday through Wednesday this week, bringing the 11-day total to 649,967.</p>
