<h1>Treat Mom to a great restaurant meal, takeout style</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mother’s Day tradition will be broken for many moms this year because restaurants remain shuttered.</p>
<p>While in some states and regions, restaurants can open provided social distancing measures are observed, the situation is unclear in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;Gov. Tom Wolf has announced that some lockdown measures in some parts of the state will be relaxed starting Friday, but it is not known yet whether restaurants in the area will be allowed to open on Sunday.</p>
<p>Even if restaurants are open, they might be able to handle only a fraction of the usual clientele because the tables need to be six feet apart. And many are just fearful to dine out yet. Also, if Mom falls into a high-risk category, it would be unwise to take her out.</p>
<p>As a result, dining out is ruled out for many moms.&nbsp;But that doesn’t mean they have to slave over a hot stove.</p>
<p>Restaurants are trying to stay afloat by selling takeout food. So what better time to support local business and show Mom some love at the same time?</p>
<p>Make sure to call ahead, or order online if available. Many restaurants offer delivery through GrubHub, DoorDash or Uber Eats. Some are doing free delivery within a certain radius and some offer curbside takeout. So be sure to ask about your pickup and delivery options when you order.</p>
<p>Here is a sampling of takeout options that accommodate different budgets:</p>
