<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools said Friday it was restarting its partnership with Paragon Foods to distribute food to district families as remote instruction continues.</p>
<p>Paragon will&nbsp;distribute boxes of fresh vegetables, meat and dairy products at one location every weekday&nbsp;in October in parking lots at five schools throughout the city.</p>

<p>Trucks from Paragon will arrive at the locations at 9 a.m., and families can line up for distribution from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.</p>
<p>The distribution days and locations are:</p>
<p>The district will remain completely virtual through at least the end of October due to COVID-19 concerns. It is still possible that instruction could remain remote further into the school year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From May through August, Paragon, a regional supplier of fresh and specialty foods, distributed bags of fresh vegetables at schools every Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
