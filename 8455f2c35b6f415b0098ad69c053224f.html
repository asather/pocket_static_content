<h1>Penguins recall Anthony Angello and Andrew Agozzino</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins on Thursday recalled forwards Anthony Angello and Andrew Agozzino from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League.</p>
<p>Angello leads the AHL club with 16 goals, three of them game-winners. The 6-foot-5, 210-pound winger was a fifth-round draft pick in 2014. After playing collegiately at Cornell, he has 32 goals and 22 assists in 112 AHL games.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old winger is looking to make his NHL debut with the Penguins.</p>
<p>Agozzino has recorded one point in nine games with the Penguins this season. The 29-year-old leads Wilkes-Barre/Scranton with 33 points and was named to the AHL’s All-Star game, though he did not play in that game this week.</p>
<p>The Penguins recalled the players on an emergency basis. We may get more clarity on the situation Thursday afternoon, when they practice in Cranberry.</p>
<p>Nick Bjugstad has been sidelined since <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/11/21/pittsburgh-penguins-zach-trotman-justin-schultz-injury/stories/201911210150?cid=search" target="_blank">having surgery in November</a> to repair a core muscle injury but could return to practice soon. Dominik Kahun suffered a concussion Jan. 19 and missed the last game before the All-Star break.</p>
<p>The Penguins opted to recall Angello and Agozzino over other options such as Sam Lafferty and Joseph Blandisi, who were both sent down last week.</p>
