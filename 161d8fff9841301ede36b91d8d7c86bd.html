<h1>Allegheny County will allow outdoor dining, bars and casinos to reopen Friday — with restrictions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department on Wednesday announced it would allow restaurants, bars and casinos to resume operations Friday with restrictions as the region experiences a surge in new COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>The new, two-week <a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Health_Department/Resources/COVID-19/Docs/ACHD%20COVID-19%20Control%20Measure%20Order%207-8-2020.pdf" target="_blank">order</a>&nbsp;allows outdoor dining to resume and rescinds previous mitigation efforts announced June 28 and July 2, which <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/06/28/covid-19-coronavirus-allegheny-county-western-pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-32/stories/202006280096" target="_blank">banned alcohol sales</a> in bars and restaurants before <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/02/COVID-19-coronavirus-Allegheny-County-Western-Pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-200/stories/202007020115" target="_blank">closing all dining facilities and casinos</a> for one week. The updated guidance goes into effect Friday at 12:01 a.m.</p>
<p>Indoor dining is still prohibited. New restrictions include a maximum of three alcoholic drinks per customer during on-site service and requirements that customers are seated at a table. Indoor areas are only for through traffic. Dining service is allowed until 11 p.m., but takeout and delivery can continue beyond that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tobacco products and e-cigarettes are prohibited at outdoor dining facilities and indoors at casinos, which&nbsp;can resume gaming operations and offer outdoor dining if it’s available.&nbsp;Face coverings must be worn at all times while inside casinos,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/01/pa-masks-required-anyone-who-leaves-home-covid-19-cases-increase-pennsylvania/stories/202007010145" target="_blank">per order from the state</a>.</p>
<p>Gatherings are restricted to 25 people indoors, and 50 people outdoors. These restrictions do not apply to religious gatherings, which follow guidance from the state. According to Pennsylvania’s <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/process-to-reopen-pennsylvania/" target="_blank">green phase rules</a>, large gatherings are restricted to a maximum of 250 people.</p>
<p>The new guidance follows studies that show COVID-19 is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/well/live/coronavirus-spread-outdoors-party.html" target="_blank">not spread as easily outdoors</a> as indoors, county spokesperson Amie Downs said. Many of the new cases came from people who had been frequenting bars and restaurants, and some locations were reportedly not following social distancing guidelines, county officials said last week.</p>
<p><em>Here’s a copy of the new order:</em></p>
<p>Of the ability to do so and serve food outdoors, he said, "It's a small step in the right direction."</p>
<p>But it's not one every establishment can take, because not every establishment has an outdoor space or one that's worth opening at 50% capacity.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Hawley’s Napa Prime Chophouse in Marshall does not have outdoor seating and so will remain closed. His Off the Hook, also in Marshall, has some, but he wasn't quite sure if opening that would be economically viable. To reopen to customers even outdoors, establishments will need to hire back staff and purchase food and drink.</p>
<p>His questions remain: "What is the enforcement?" and, if some establishments don't follow the particulars of the order, "Are they going to shut us all down again?"</p>
<p>For those that can reopen, like The Warren Bar &amp; Burrow in the Cultural District, Downtown, the update is welcome. “Three drinks [will] give people enough time to hang around, see their friends, have a couple of drinks and head home,” said Spencer Warren, co-owner of The Warren. He said the limit may even help servers turn their tables more frequently, thus bringing in more customers.</p>
<p>“It’ll help us because we’re a destination place for cocktails,” Mr. Warren said. He kept his staff, hoping that he’d begin to resume service soon. But he echoed Mr. Hawley’s concerns that the new restrictions could create a difficult choice for locations that let their employees go. “Are&nbsp;they gonna reopen or not?”</p>
<p>The new rules, Mr. Warren said, may be trickier to enforce than observing social distancing.&nbsp;“It’s gonna be very hard, other than sending undercover people, to make sure people aren’t serving more than three drinks,” he said.</p>
<p>John Longstreet, the PRLA’s president and CEO, said he appreciates the dialogue with Allegheny County and agrees, "It's a step." He also appreciates that Allegheny County issued the order a day before the previous one expired to give operators more time. Balancing public safety and economic concerns, he acknowledged, "It's not easy."</p>
<p>Allegheny County operators still are waiting to hear what restrictions, if any, the state might put on their peers in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/07/covid-19-coronavirus-allegheny-county-western-pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-36/stories/202007070076" target="_blank">surrounding counties</a>, where COVID-19 cases also are rising.</p>
