<h1>Pittsburgh council has new president, new member</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council on Monday chose Theresa Kail-Smith as its new president, and swore in new member Bobby Wilson, inaugurating the 141st session of the nine-member legislative body.</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith replaces as president Councilman Bruce Kraus, who led council’s last three sessions — six years which were marked by good relations between council and Mayor Bill Peduto’s administration.</p>
<p>The new president emerged as a compromise candidate after a month during which fellow members&nbsp;Ricky Burgess and Corey O’Connor were vying for the top post, but failed to secure the required five votes of support.</p>
<p>The vote was unanimous.</p>
<p>“It happened at the 11th hour, I can tell you that,” Ms. Kail-Smith said of the discussions that led to the vote making her president. “I think that we wanted to make sure our council was unified and working together. And hopefully my colleagues feel that I’ll be able to do that.”</p>
<p>The vote for president came minutes after the swearing in of&nbsp;Bobby Wilson, 36, of Spring Hill-City View.</p>
<p>“I’m proud to be a fifth generation North Sider and to raise my kids on the same block I grew up on,” said the father of three.&nbsp;“... As a new councilman, I will seek to be informed by rich histories of each neighborhood, and the guidance of their leaders.”</p>
<p>He said he would not stand for development that displaced residents, as did the creation of Allegheny Center and then the East Street Valley Expressway and I-279 North, both of which drove his grandparents from their homes.&nbsp;“Longtime Pittsburghers must not be displaced by new development,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson, a medical center technologist, ran with the backing of Mayor Bill Peduto and Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, the ground forces of the Service Employees International Union, and funding from developers including Walnut Capital and Mistick Construction.&nbsp;He rode the Democratic nomination he wrested from Ms. Harris in May to a convincing victory over independent Chris Rosselot and Socialist Workers Party candidate Malcolm Jarrett.</p>
<p>District Judge Derwin Rushing swore him in.</p>
<p>Also sworn in were Mr. Kraus and Mr. Burgess, both for their fourth terms; Mr. O’Connor, for his third; and Deb Gross, of Highland Park, who is beginning her second term.</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith, of Westwood, won a special election to council in 2009, making her the third-longest-serving council member, trailing Mr. Kraus and Rev. Burgess.</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith thanked both Mr. Kraus and Rev. Burgess for their leadership. The latter was the chairman of council’s finance committee.</p>
<p>She appointed R. Daniel Lavelle to serve as the new finance committee chairman. Rev. Burgess then won, over Ms. Gross, to serve as council president pro tem.</p>
<p>“I tried to bring everybody together, everyone who had differences, differences of opinion, and different sides — I tried to give both sides something so we could all work together,” said Ms. Kail-Smith.</p>
<p>Council’s new president has a recent voting history that is less pro-mayor than her predecessor.</p>
<p>She opposed Mayor Bill Peduto's purchase of a building on the Boulevard of the Allies, for $27.5 million, for use as an economic development hub. She and three other council members argued that the purchase price was too high, but a narrow council majority approved the purchase.</p>
<p>She was also on the losing side of a 6-3 vote banning the use of certain assault-style weapons and ammunition as well as allowing courts to temporarily confiscate weapons from those who post an "extreme risk" to themselves or others.&nbsp;Allegheny County Common Pleas Senior Judge Joseph M. James struck down those ordinances, but the city is appealing that decision.</p>
<p>She opposed the mayor-supported property tax increase for park improvements and programs, which voters nonetheless approved in a November referendum.</p>
<p>“I think I’ve done all of those things while respecting the mayor and respecting that position and that office, and that’s not going to change,” Ms. Kail-Smith said. She said she’ll prioritize “working more closely with the administration, on making sure we’re yielding results for all of our residents, and making sure that all of us feel like we have a voice in our government.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith isn’t the first woman to lead council — Sophie Masloff and Darlene Harris also had that honor — but said she believes she’s the first person from the city’s western neighborhoods to hold the post. “And I might be the only Middle Eastern person from the Hill,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith was unopposed for reelection in 2017, and represents Banksville, Beechview, Chartiers City, Crafton Heights, Duquesne Heights, East Carnegie, Elliott, Esplen, Fairywood, part of Mt. Washington, Oakwood, Ridgemont, South Shore, Sheraden, West End, Westwood and Windgap.</p>
<p>Had Rev. Burgess won the presidency, he would have been the second African American to serve in that post. The first was Lou Mason, of the Hill District, whose tenure as council’s leader started in 1970 and ended with his resignation from the city’s legislature in 1977. Had the late Mr. Mason stayed as president for two more months, he would have been in line to become mayor when Pete Flaherty left that office and became a deputy U.S. attorney general.</p>
<p>When a color guard led the newly elected and reelected members into Council Chamber, Rev. Burgess was missing from the procession. He entered minutes later, while Councilwoman Erika Strassburger was leading the not-quite-capacity audience in America the Beautiful.</p>
<p>“I am now the longest-serving African American councilman in the history of the city of Pittsburgh.”&nbsp;he said later, to applause, adding that he got there by surviving “the ugliest, nastiest campaign of my life. I have been attacked by sad, selfish, small-minded people.”</p>
<p>Mr. O’Connor would have been the second member of his family to serve in that role, following his father, Bob O’Connor, who later served eight months as mayor before his death in 2006. His mother, Judy O’Connor, held the Bible for his swearing in.</p>
<p>Mr. Kraus, before formally handing over the presidency, said he wants his tenure “to be remembered for the respect that we have offered one another as colleagues” rather than as “combatants.”</p>
<p>“I hope that I am remembered for ensuring a common table,” he added.</p>
<p>Council’s president runs the Tuesday legislative sessions, names other members to head committees, sets dates and times for special meetings, serves on a variety of boards and becomes mayor if the sitting mayor cannot finish out a term. Three of the six mayors preceding Mr. Peduto either died or ascended to higher office during their terms, necessitating succession processes.</p>
<p>The drive for equity in a city with deep disparities -- especially between white and black residents -- was a recurring theme in the ceremonial start of the new council session.</p>
<p>“We have not achieved the inclusivity that we talk about and that we strive for, and we need to do better,” said Ms. Gross.</p>
<p>“So, what are you going to do, rev?” Rev. Burgess asked himself, during his speech after his swearing in. “I’ve got more houses to build. I’ve got more people to hire. … My vision is not just for African Americans. My vision is for the whole city of Pittsburgh, because we get better together.”</p>
<p>Starting with a color guard from the University of Pittsburgh Air Force Reserve Officers’ Training Corp., the biennial ceremony had its share of pomp and circumstance, but also some levity.</p>
<p>“In the next four years that I remain here,” Mr. O’Connor said in his speech after being sworn in, “I want to figure out <a title="Manger story" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2017/12/20/nativity-scene-City-Council-Christmas-pittsburgh-darlene-harris-bruce-kraus/stories/201712200126" target="_blank">who stole the manger scene</a> from underneath the Christmas tree.”</p>
