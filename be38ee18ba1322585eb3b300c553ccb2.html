<h1>Penguins defenseman John Marino reflects on a memorable rookie season </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Had the Penguins not discovered under-the-radar defenseman John Marino and swung a heist of a trade, the 22-year-old rookie might be studying for psychology and economics finals at Harvard right now and preparing for graduation.</p>
<p>Had the COVID-19 pandemic not turned our world upside down and caused the NHL to “pause” the season, Marino should be playing in his first NHL postseason with a Penguins team that always has Stanley Cup aspirations.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>The reality is Marino is hunkered down in Hilton Head, S.C., with family. He’s playing video games, taking bike rides and playing some tennis — basically anything to stay active while he waits for word on if or when the season might resume.</p>
<p>“Obviously, it’s not ideal,” Marino said. “Hopefully we can use this time to spend a little bit more time with our families and kind of make the most of it.”</p>
<p>This is the second time, really, that Marino’s rookie year has been put on pause unexpectedly. His season was cruising along when the blue-liner took a Steven Stamkos slap shot to the face on Feb. 6 in Tampa. The subsequent surgery sidelined Marino for about a month.</p>
<p>Just before the season was suspended, the rookie returned with a shield like the one he wore at Harvard. During a conference call with local reporters on Tuesday, Marino said that if the season resumes, his face has healed enough that he doesn’t expect he’ll have to wear a full shield.</p>
<p>“It’s tough sitting out, whether you’re injured or you’re not playing or whatever it might be,” Marino said. “You just take it one step at a time and do what you can and kind of take all the positives you can out of it.”</p>
<p>The rough turns that Marino’s season have taken feel out of place, given how smoothly it all began.</p>
<p>After Jim Rutherford pulled off what is already one of the most lopsided trades of his Penguins tenure – acquiring Marino from Edmonton in exchange for only a sixth-round pick – the rookie emerged almost instantly. Eventually, he earned regular minutes in the top four and even some time in the top pairing.</p>
<p>“The first couple games of the season, every one was kind of a pinch yourself moment,” Marino said. “I kind of took every game as a learning process, talking with the coaches and the coaching staff and going over the little things to round out my game.”</p>
<p>Marino’s big frame, strong base and slick skating helped him make almost a seamless transition from the college game to the NHL. As his season progressed, he began to flash some offensive upside as well.</p>
<p>But his best attribute, probably, was his poise. Asked once about Marino’s ability to keep a steady pulse in tough situations, coach Mike Sullivan joked, “What pulse?”</p>
<p>While the transition looked smooth from the outside, Marino said there was some adjustment, especially when it came to the workload. In college, Marino never played more than 35 games in a season. In his first NHL season, Marino played in 56, accumulating some “bumps and bruises” along the way.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say injuries, but some nagging stuff that you don’t experience until you play the full NHL season or you play that many games,” Marino said. “You don’t really think about it in college. You’re playing on the weekends and then you have the whole week to rest up your body. Whereas there’s not as much rest time in the NHL.”</p>
<p>Now, Marino’s had plenty of time to rest. The NHL has extended the self-quarantine guidelines through the end of April. Should the season return, Marino said it would probably take about three weeks to a month to get timing and rhythm back.</p>
<p>When might that happen? At this point, it’s anyone’s guess how Marino’s rookie season might end.</p>
