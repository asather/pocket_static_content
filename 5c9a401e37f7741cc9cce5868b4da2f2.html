<h1>Paul Zeise: Mitch Keller among Pirates' early bright spots</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There may or may not be a Major League Baseball season much longer, but the Pirates and every other team did play an entire weekend of baseball. It could be the end of the line in the era of overreaction because of a COVID-19 outbreak by the Marlins, but that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The Pirates played three games and did about what I expected they would do. They lost two and they won one in St Louis against the Cardinals, so while it wasn’t a successful weekend, it wasn’t totally lost either. And there were some really encouraging things that happened for the Pirates, as well.</p>
<p>I think the doom-and-gloom crowd might want to reconsider because I think the Pirates proved they will win a lot more than expected.</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. The Pirates are not a great team. Nor are they a good team. But they are also not an atrocious team, either, and that is what many predicted they would be. I don’t think they will contend for a playoff spot, but I do think they might be able to exceed expectations.</p>
<p>That is admittedly a low bar to achieve, but it is what it is. They were predicted to be one of the worst teams in baseball, but I saw enough this weekend to believe they might be a little better than that.</p>
<p>I predicted they would win between 26 and 28 games this season and nothing I saw this weekend suggests they can’t do that. They have a few good pieces in place and just enough pitching to contend.</p>
<p>The biggest story to me this weekend is Mitch Keller because he is such an important part of the Pirates’ present and future.</p>
<p>We knew what the Pirates have in Joe Musgrove and Trevor Williams, and we’re pretty sure what those two will give them on a nightly basis. Neither is an ace but both are crafty enough to give the Pirates a legitimate chance to win games. And for the most part, both did about what you would expect this weekend so there wasn’t much to see in either of their starts.</p>
<p>Keller, however, is the wild card of the staff and one of the most important players on the roster. He needs to take the next step as a pitcher from his rookie year if the Pirates are going to have any kind of respectable season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Sunday, he showed he has the chance to be the kind of pitcher the Pirates are hoping he is. He wasn’t overpowering and didn’t go deep into the game, but he was effective. He pitched five innings and gave up only two hits and one run. He did walk three and threw 87 pitches and only 47 for strikes, but he got the win and he has something to build on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As he goes through this and gets stronger and builds up his arm, it would figure he will begin to get deeper into games. And I would assume the more he pitches, the more efficient he will be. He has to throw more pitches for strikes, obviously, but for his first start of the year there was a lot to like.</p>
<p>Pirates fans should also feel good about reliever Nick Burdi. Remember that closer issue the Pirates have because Keone Kela is out? Not after watching Burdi filet the Cardinals in the ninth inning Sunday. He needed only 11 pitches to strike out the side, and it is clear his arm is electric again. He needs to stay healthy — a big question mark — but if he can, he will make the Pirates forget about the Kela fiasco.</p>
<p>The Pirates aren’t going to be a playoff team, but they do have a chance to be competitive. And that’s especially true if they get from Keller and Burdi what the duo gave them Sunday.</p>
