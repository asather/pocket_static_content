<h1>Police probe Snapchat video showing Westmoreland County child vaping while being babysat</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Charges are pending against two teenage girls accused of letting a 2-year-old boy whom one of them was babysitting use a vaping device containing nicotine.</p>
<p>Video of the incident was posted to social media. Pennsylvania State Police in Indiana County said they learned of it Sunday through the state attorney general’s Safe2SaySomething tipline.</p>
<p>Police got the video and launched an investigation.</p>
<p>The incident occurred Jan. 9 at a home in St. Clair, Westmoreland County, between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., police said.</p>
<p>A 17-year-old girl from Seward was babysitting on Jan-L Street when the 2-year-old&nbsp;“took the vaping device from a nightstand and began to use it,” police said.</p>
<p>The babysitter and an 18-year-old woman from Armagh, Indiana County, who was also in the house, let the child inhale, police said. He coughed but&nbsp;“did not display any other visible effects from inhaling,” police said.</p>
<p>One or both of the teenagers took video and posted it to Snapchat.</p>
<p>The child is from New Florence. It was unclear whose house they were in when the vaping incident occurred.</p>
<p>Police said the teenagers and the child are not related.</p>
<p>The vaping device is believed to have contained 3% nicotine but no THC, the compound that gives pot its high, police said.</p>
<p>Police contacted the child’s parent, who were not aware of what happened.</p>
<p>The incident was reported by Children and Youth Services.</p>
<p>Police said charges of endangering the welfare of children are pending against both teenagers.</p>
