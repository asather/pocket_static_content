<h1>Letters from Pirates camp: An ode to those who mend our bodies and egos</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Dru Scott was a college baseball player at Manchester University in North Manchester, Ind., when he injured his ankle and ventured into the training room for help.</p>
<p>He’s basically never left.</p>
<p>Scott, the athletic training coordinator, is now in his 11th season with the Pirates and his third with Class AAA Indianapolis. Suffice to say, the assignment he has this week — and has had three or four times prior — is much, much different than what he’s done the rest of the time.</p>
<p>Along with four other guys, the athletic training staff is easily the most popular group of people here at Pirates Fantasy Camp — and that extends to this camper here. All this week, Scott has helped make my right arm passable by rubbing Red Hot Ointment on it, a red balm that feels like it sounds, like someone has taken a blow torch to your skin.</p>
<p>Scott has also basically stitched the skin back together on my right big toe, mending a rather large and funky blister, while Pirates&nbsp;minor league draft/medical services coordinator Carl Randolph helped me work out some sort of knot in my lower back.</p>
<p>“It’s different,” Scott said with a laugh when I asked about what it’s like working fantasy camp versus taking care of actual baseball players. “Different type of athlete. But it’s fun. It’s a laid-back atmosphere. You guys are down here to have fun, so we make it fun.”</p>
<p>The training room is a happening place, especially early in the morning when everybody is trying to feel good enough to go out and play. After games, there are hot and cold tubs that are generally packed to the gills with 10 or 12 guys trying to do some preventative maintenance for the next day.</p>
<p>(I tried the cold tub Tuesday, immersing my entire body up to my neck. Won’t do that again. Think I only thawed out a couple hours ago.)</p>
<p>Seriously, though, I give these guys a lot of credit. Not only do they do a terrific job, but as Scott said, they do make it fun. They don’t act or annoyed or make you feel stupid. They simply do whatever they can to help you feel better, and I know a lot of the men and women here really appreciate that.</p>
<p>Scott said their busiest day is usually the second one, when a bunch of campers who did entirely too much the first day are suddenly paying the price.</p>
<p>“That second day is usually your big day,” Scott said. “The line is out the door. The hot rub is in the air. You can smell it down the hallway. First day starts off a little slow. Second day really picks up. Then by the end of the week, with only the championship game going on, you can see it’s pretty bare.”</p>
<p>What sort of problems do Scott and others see most frequently?</p>
<p>“Depends on what day of the week it is,” Scott said. “Lot of hamstring strains. Lot of calf strains. A lot of bruises. A lot of hurt egos. It just depends. It varies each day.”</p>
<p>Scott went to Clinton Prairie High School in Frankfort, Ind., where he played football, baseball and wrestled. He played two years of baseball at Manchester — back when it was a college, not a university. A physical education major at first, Scott knew he wanted to go into athletic training whenever he hurt himself.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Scott can laugh about everything is because he figures he’d be in our shoes if he ever tried to play again — in pain, relying on the athletic trainers get through the week, searching for relief and a way to feel even remotely normal again.</p>
<p>“It makes me laugh a little bit, but I would be doing the same thing,” Scott said. “Former athlete, so you want to hold on to that as long as you can. But it makes you appreciate the fanbase that is here in Pittsburgh. Makes you laugh. Makes you humble. Makes you feel a lot of things. It’s just a fun, laid-back atmosphere.”</p>
<p>The whole physical-pain aspect of this week has been interesting. For one, I’m surprised by how much of it I’ve incurred. Though I run regularly, every day my legs have felt heavy and sore. I’ve written about my arm issues, and it’s definitely … not good. Whether it’s my elbow or shoulder, I’m not really sure. But it’s probably a good thing we only have one more game left.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, we’re talking about people who are mostly in their 40s, 50s and 60s, with a couple in their 70s and one in his 80s. They exercise some, too, but there’s not a single person here who feels great physically right now.</p>
<p>Yet it doesn’t matter, even a little bit.</p>
<p>Campers come here knowing they’ll be limping around Pirate City for the week. And lucky for Scott, Randolph, assistant medical services coordinator Lee Slagle, Class A Greensboro athletic trainer Matt McNamee and Bristol athletic trainer Casey Lee, they get to deal with it.</p>
<p>So, well, thanks guys.</p>
<p>“We treat you just like we would any player, take care of you and try to get you out there to compete,” Scott said. “Whatever that level of compete looks like, we try to get you out there for that.”</p>
