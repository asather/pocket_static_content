<h1>As businesses start to open, workers weigh health risk versus paycheck — and potential loss of unemployment benefits</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As counties move toward reopening parts of the economy, employers are calling their workers back —&nbsp;but some are saying no.</p>
<p>In April and May, Pennsylvania employers filed 540 reports of people who refused to return to work. Of those, more than 300 reports came in the last week and a half.</p>
<p>The reports were filed through an online form the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry uses to collect complaints from employers, something that was set up long before COVID-19 but now is seeing a tremendous surge in use.</p>
<p>From January to March this year, the department had received 128 reports, according to Susan Dickinson, director of the Office of Unemployment Compensation Benefits Policy. And, most of those reports came from the same employer. Before the pandemic, “usage was limited,” Ms. Dickinson said.</p>
<p>Now, employees being called back to work face an extra decision when deciding whether to accept the offer: Is the paycheck worth the potential health risk?</p>
<p>“The issue here is if the work made available to you is unsafe, and if there is an abnormally high risk to your health and safety, was work then really made available to you?” said Wendell Young, president of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776, a union that represents sectors ranging from retail to meatpacking.</p>
<p>“Many of our members work with the public: supermarkets, pharmacies, liquor stores,” he said. “Our members can do everything right but if those people coming in those stores cross their path, get in their face, aren’t wearing their masks … that puts our people at risk.”</p>
<p><strong>Who is still eligible?</strong></p>
<p>Though many of UFCW’s members work at life-sustaining businesses like grocery stores and food warehouses and have been permitted to work throughout the public health crisis, up to 30% of workers at some places have chosen to stay home, Mr. Young said, based on union data.&nbsp;They cited their age or health or the age or health of someone in their household.</p>
<p>For the most part, those workers were able to make an arrangement with their employer, he said. Some stayed on payroll and some filed for unemployment benefits.&nbsp;It is still too soon to tell if the majority of those unemployment benefits were approved, Mr. Young said.</p>
<p>The question of who is eligible to receive unemployment compensation has been asked repeatedly since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>That’s partly because a historic number of claims led to a backlog in processing and receiving benefits and partly because the federal government put in place new programs that expanded benefits.</p>
<p>With an additional $600 weekly tacked on to any eligible individual’s unemployment benefits through a new federal program that runs through July, some people could even be bringing in more money through unemployment compensation than they would in their normal paycheck.</p>
<p>Now, as businesses start to reopen, state unemployment centers looking at claims requests are adding another set of considerations.&nbsp;Government officials must make sure no one is forced back to work in unsafe conditions and no one is left without benefits they are eligible for —&nbsp;while also making sure no one is granted benefits for simply turning down a job.</p>
<p>“If an employer has an employee who refuses to come back to work and the work fits within all the normal guidelines of going back to work, that employee should go back to work,” Secretary of Labor and Industry Jerry Oleksiak said at a press briefing Monday. “And if they don’t, that employer should report them.”</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry plans to evaluate each scenario on a case-by-case basis that considers factors such as the applicant’s age and health conditions, and safety standards at the workplace.</p>
<p>“When the government shut down nonessential businesses, folks in those nonessential businesses were very comfortable they were eligible for unemployment and no one was going to take it away,” said Barney Oursler, founder of the Mon Valley Unemployed Committee.</p>
<p>Now, “There’s no guarantee from the government.”</p>
<p>If someone has an underlying health condition that classifies them as high risk, Mr. Oursler recommends they get a note from their doctor to show their employer. If they are simply worried about the virus, individuals have fewer options, he said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know any way to protect people at this point that are just afraid of the virus,” Mr. Oursler said. “At this point, there’s no rule that I’m aware of that protects your unemployment if you’re just afraid to go back to work.”</p>
<p><strong>Shields and vacation days</strong></p>
<p>Across every industry, and every business, employers are working to make arrangements to ease people’s fears, whether that is offering teleworking options or shifting schedules to limit the number of people working at once. But, every industry and every business also will have their own unique challenges in maintaining proper mitigation.</p>
<p>At county assistance offices, for example, where people can go to get help with programs like SNAP benefits and family assistance, workers don’t have face shields like those customers would see at a grocery store, said Steve Catanese, president of the local chapter of the Service Employees International Union.</p>
<p>On construction sites, social distancing is easy when workers are repairing a highway, but difficult when they are working indoors, said Jeff Nobers, executive director of the Builder’s Guild of Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>At the state’s wine and spirits stores, employees were already struggling to keep enough space between them and their coworkers. Letting customers back in will compound problems that are already there, Mr. Young of the UFCW said.</p>
<p>One Coraopolis resident, who asked to remain anonymous so his company could not identify him, chose to burn through his vacation days rather than return to work. He wanted to protect his wife and son, who have health conditions that marks them high-risk.</p>
<p>As a worker in auto sales, he was called back at the end of April when Gov. Tom Wolf authorized online car sales.</p>
<p>“I felt like right then, I had to make a choice between my family’s safety” and the job, he said. “I felt abandoned from the company. It wasn’t until I started pushing back that they said, ‘OK, you can use your vacation time.’”</p>
<p>With 12 vacation days, he is starting to explore other options. When he asks if he can still collect unemployment benefits, no one seems to know, he said.</p>
<p>Jean Frye, a Lyft driver from Ross, stopped offering rides about seven weeks ago to protect her health. As an immunocompromised individual and at 65 years old, Ms. Frye said she has no idea when she will start driving again —&nbsp;she is worried about a second wave of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“If you haven’t gotten it, you’re playing Russian roulette as far as I’m concerned,” she said.</p>
<p>Lyft has instructed drivers to prohibit passengers from sitting in the front seat and to require them to wear masks, Ms. Frye said. Those things can be difficult to enforce.</p>
<p>She would feel more comfortable working in an office environment where she knew safety standards were being followed, rather than inviting passengers into her car, she said.</p>
<p>But, having yet to receive any unemployment benefits though her application has been accepted through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, she is reluctant to find another job in case that affects her eligibility.</p>
<p>In the construction industry, which got the approval to resume operations May 1, workers have always had the option to turn down a job, Mr. Nobers said.</p>
<p>Many people do, if the commute is too long or they’ve decided to start their own ventures. But it is generally expected that if a worker is collecting unemployment benefits and they are called to a job, they will accept the offer.</p>
<p>“In our industry, if you’re a tradesperson, if you are not working, you’re not getting paid. You’re not generating benefits,” Mr. Nobers said.</p>
<p>“Construction workers especially, but I think the work ethos of the region is people want to be at work,” he said. “They want to be working. They don’t want to be home on the couch watching TV.”</p>
