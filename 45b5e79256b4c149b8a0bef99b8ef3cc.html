<h1>Should we eat that? Experts say low risk for COVID-19 to spread through food as workers in food industry test positive</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A question stands out as employees in various food service industries and meat processing plants are testing positive for COVID-19:&nbsp;Are meats, vegetables and other sustenance we purchase at grocery stores or elsewhere safe to eat?</p>
<p>The short answer is yes, as the disease has not been proven to survive in food or on packaging, experts say.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The more important issue may be the health of workers who handle the food and how their absence will affect supply and the greater economy, according to state officials.</p>
<p>The meat supply chain, especially, is vulnerable as more processing is done at plants that butcher tens of thousands of animals daily. The closure of even a few of those plants can quickly be felt by customers. Smithfield Foods Inc., was forced to close its Sioux Falls, S.D., location after nearly 300 of the plant’s 3,700 workers tested positive for the virus. The plant produces roughly 5% of the U.S. pork supply each day.&nbsp;Six employees at the company’s Arnold site also tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the last week, although the Westmoreland County facility remains opens.</p>
<p>As plants shut down, farmers are forced to keep animals that would normally be sent to slaughter. With more than $4.3 billion in annual sales for meat, poultry, and fish products, state agriculture officials said they aren’t quite sure how much money may be lost in coming months. About 2,300 food-processing companies across the state also provide shipments of canned fruit, vegetable specialty products, chocolate and cocoa, and potato chips and pretzels, to name a few.</p>
<p>“The food supply chain is incredibly complex,” said Shannon Powers, a spokeswoman with the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.&nbsp;“It’s something you’re used to relying on because the food will be there when you go to the store.</p>
<p>“But this system relies on the predictability of what the market is going to be. If you are a company who provided to&nbsp;restaurants and universities that are now closed,&nbsp;then your economy has been turned on its head. The [state agriculture] department is working with various industry advocates that represent different sectors to make sure the food system continues to work.”</p>
<p>Common misconceptions surrounding food borne illnesses have led to&nbsp;unnecessary panic, according to Ms. Powers. For example, meat plant workers can not “infect” the meat they handle with the coronavirus. Meat processing plants in the state also don’t receive imported food from other countries, she said. When asked what the future food economy looks like at this rate for meat processing plants and the food supply chain in general, department officials could not provide an immediate answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A lot of what happens going forward will depend on federal spending, and how discretionary funds are targeted,” Ms. Powers said. “Things are changing rapidly, but the department’s main goal is to keep workers and customers safe.”</p>
<p>Plants that are closed are advised to deeply sanitize the building, including areas away&nbsp;from food production such as locker rooms where workers shower and dress. State and local health officials have recommended that food processing plants — where hundreds of employees often stand elbow to elbow —&nbsp;stagger work times to practice social distancing, install floor markings, consider setting special hours for vulnerable workers, as well as follow other sanitation guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>“From day to day with meat production, the pace is pretty consistent, but it could be slowed due to workers calling off sick,” said North American Meat Institute spokeswoman Sarah Little.&nbsp;“With COVID-19, if you have a lot of folks at home or away on quarantine then work progress is slowed down.”</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, workers were required before the coronavirus outbreak to wear&nbsp;protective clothing such as safety shoes or boots with toe guards and slip-resistant soles. Protective gloves are worn to reduce the spread of diseases from raw meats. In addition, workers who use knives must be provided with metal mesh gloves and aprons as well as wrist and forearm guards to protect them from possible knife cuts. Goggles are to be worn, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meat plants in the state have had trouble obtaining enough masks for workers since the coronarvirus, however, according to union officials.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No worries — for now</strong></p>
<p>The difference between viruses and bacteria is that viruses are smaller and can’t grow in foods, according to Cornell University professor and food science expert Robert Gravani.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Gravani said he believes the food system in America will prevail and will result in a more entrepreneurial spirit among food workers. But the&nbsp;spike in store purchases in the last month of everything from toilet paper to meat caused a “tremendous imbalance” to the supply system, he said.</p>
<p>“We have an incredible food system in this country,” he said. “We can source foods from all around the world, but most people have no idea of the complexity of the global food supply chain. I think companies in the food supply chain will continue to do a good job. Cleaning is at an even higher level now, and that will only help us down the line.”</p>
<p>Inaccurate information and miscommunication have only served to keep people afraid, Mr. Gravani said. He stressed the importance of hand washing and encouraged people to wipe down commonly touched items often, such as door knobs, keyboards and refrigerator handles while home.</p>
<p>Although there is no cure for the virus now, sanitation destroys the bug and clears surfaces of any particles.</p>
<p>Listening only to what health officials recommend is paramount, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With so many hungry people, and people who are food insecure, we can’t afford to waste food,” Mr. Gravani said. “We have to make sure food workers at meat plants and even toilet paper plants, are healthy to make sure food gets transferred into stores. Workers should be staying home if they are sick. We have to bring safety and sanitation to the top of the line these days. It’s not a time to be cavalier, or casually disregard the advice of health officials.</p>
