<h1>Buying Here: Old storefront, cool loft in Ligonier priced at $375,000 </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Thirteen years ago, Jackie and Andy Horvath finished a beautiful <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/homes/2008/10/11/Lofty-conversion/stories/200810110208" target="_blank">conversion of a century-old hardware store</a> at <strong>114 N. Market St.</strong> in downtown Ligonier.</p>
<p>The couple took her dream of starting a business and married it with his can-do spirit to transform the brick building into retail space with history and a 2,000-square-foot loft apartment with a rooftop party deck.</p>
<p>Now, the Horvaths’ dreams have changed. They have set their sights on the beach and placed the building on the market for $375,000 (MLS No. 1399099) with Tracey M. Pelesky of Loyalhanna Realty (724-510-4010 or <a href="https://www.loyalhanna.com/listings.htm" target="_blank">www.loyalhanna.com</a>). It is open by appointment in accordance with COVID-19 guidelines.</p>
<p>The building was erected in 1906 and remained Ligonier Hardware until the couple purchased it in 2006. At that time, the business had been closed for a few years.&nbsp;The first floor was converted into an antiques shop called “Jackie’s House.”</p>
<p>“We had an antique shop in there for about eight years,” Ms. Horvath said. “Then we transitioned to a sports gear and clothing store for about four years.”</p>
<p>Her husband said the space fit their lifestyle.</p>
<p>“My wife lives on her bike,” he said. “There are a lot of wonderful biking trails and roads around here. I walk everywhere we need to go.”</p>
<p>The couple worked with architect P. Scott Moore of Latrobe and carpenters Pete Hamer and Troy Pritts on the 10-month renovation.&nbsp;Reminders of the building’s history include marks on the floor used to measure cable, wiring and fencing. The first floor also holds many of the original hardware display cases.</p>
<p>The second floor measures 100 feet long and 20 feet wide.&nbsp;The large, open living space has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. One wall was opened up to let in more light for a sun room. Five skylights were also installed during the renovation.</p>
<p>“It flows really nicely,” Mr. Horvath said. “My wife does really well with plants. It looks like a jungle out there.”</p>
<p>The kitchen’s backsplash is hand-made majolica tiles above Corian counter tops. The six aluminum stools around the island are circa 1930. They came from a drugstore in West Virginia and were recovered with red leather for a fun soda fountain vibe.</p>
<p>The rooftop deck is a spectacular space with parquet-style decking, a hot tub and lots of places to sit and gather.</p>
<p>The home is being sold with most of the furnishings, including several antiques.</p>
<p>“We have a Chinese apothecary cabinet,” Mr. Horvath said. “Those items will not fit in down there.”</p>
<p>The building is in the Ligonier Valley School District. Taxes are $3,064 per year.</p>
<p>The building is less than a block from shops and restaurants in the Diamond and the newly renovated YMCA, where Excela Health added a small medical center and expanded fitness facilities.</p>
<p>“We are next door to Carol and Dave’s Roadhouse and a half block from Kitchen on Main,” Mr. Horvath said. “There is a coffee shop, Abigail’s. We shop at the Giant Eagle six blocks away. There is a farmer’s market on the edge of West Main on Saturday mornings. It goes until the late fall.”</p>
<p>The couple have loved this place but are ready for the next phase of their lives.</p>
<p>“It’s just an extremely unique place to live,” she said.</p>
