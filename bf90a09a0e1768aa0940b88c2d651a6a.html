<p>The Girl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania announced Monday that it was canceling all summer day camps and sleep away camps.</p>
<p>“We look forward to summer at camp as much as our girls and volunteers, but our priority is protecting the health and safety of everyone in our Girl Scout family,” said Patricia A. Burkart, chief executive officer of Girl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania, in a press release.</p>

<p>The closure covers Girl Scout properties at Camp Hawthorne Ridge, Camp Redwing, Camp Skymeadow, and Camp Conshatawba through August 31, 2020. It applies to summer resident camps, troop and service unit camping, events, volunteer-led day camps, and rentals.</p>
<p>Those who have already registered for Girl Scout camps will receive a full refund, including deposits.</p>
<p>The Girl Scouts are working on developing “safe outdoor opportunities,” including virtual programs and guidance for earning badges at home. They will unveil their schedule of “remote outdoor programming” on June 1.</p>
<p>Other popular Pittsburgh camps, such as the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, and the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Western PA have not announced closures at this point.</p>
<p>The Laurel Highland Council of Boy Scouts of America has closed its facilities through May 1 and organizers are “having conversations daily about potential impacts on our camp programs and how we may be able to modify them if needed,” said Erik Tomalis, chief development officer for the Laurel Highlands Council. “We will do our best and continue to believe that summer camp can be a life changing experience, one that may be needed now more than ever.”</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University has canceled day and overnight camps through August 1. The University of Pittsburgh has also canceled many of its summer camps.</p>
