<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Chris Doleman, a Pitt great and Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive end, died after a two-year battle with brain cancer, the Minnesota Vikings confirmed early Wednesday. He was 58.</p>
<p>Doleman, a defensive end and linebacker with the Panthers from 1981-84, starred with the Vikings. A member of the franchise's Ring of Honor, Doleman spent his first nine seasons in Minnesota.</p>
<p>“The Minnesota Vikings express our deepest sympathies to Chris Doleman's family and friends upon his passing,” the team said. “Chris was a great example for players past and present, as he embodied all the best characteristics of a Viking — resilience, toughness, and a competitive spirit. Chris always carried himself with dignity and class. Vikings fan worldwide will greatly miss him.”</p>
<p>Pro Football Hall of Fame president and CEO David Baker also released a statement on the 2012 inductee.</p>
<p>“The entire Pro Football Hall of Fame family mourns the passing of Chris Doleman after a prolonged and courageous battle against cancer,” Baker said. “I had the honor of getting to know him not only as a great football player but an outstanding human being. ... The legacy of Chris Doleman will live forever in Canton, Ohio, for generations to learn from how he lived a life of courage and character.”</p>
<p>Before Doleman was drafted No. 4 in the 1985 NFL draft, he racked up 25 sacks with the Panthers. A York, Pa., native, Doleman chose Pitt. In Oakland, as <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2012/08/05/Doleman-praises-parents-Martin-his-mom-for-upbringing-that-led-to-the-hall-of-fame/stories/201208050178" target="_blank">Doleman put it in his 2012 induction speech</a>, he “was blessed with great coaching by remarkable men.”</p>
<p>“Jackie Sherrill, Foge Fazio, Joe Moore ... they challenged me every day,” Doleman said. “They brought out the very best in me, things that I never even knew I had inside me. They were also there to let me know I wasn't the only linebacker on the team. ... The University of Pittsburgh set a standard that is second to none.”</p>

<p>Doleman carried that to the league, where he was voted to eight Pro Bowls. He was also named first-team All-Pro twice and led the NFL with 21 sacks in 1989.</p>
<p>Doleman finished his 15-year career with 150.5 sacks, currently fifth-most all time.</p>
