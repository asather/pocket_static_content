<h1>Barry Bonds misses Baseball Hall of Fame; Derek Jeter, Larry Walker make it</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Former Pirate Barry Bonds did not receive a groundswell of support this year for the Baseball Hall of Fame and ultimately missed out on the game's highest honor.</p>
<p>During Tuesday's live TV announcement of this year's candidates, it was revealed that Bonds got 60.7% of votes — well below the 75% needed to qualify.</p>
<p>Bonds received 59.1% last year. He has two more years left on the ballot before his Hall of Fame fate will be left up to a veterans committee.</p>
<p>The two who were elected were Derek Jeter — who was one vote shy of being unanimous — and Larry Walker, in his final year of regular eligibility.</p>
<p>Bonds has been gaining momentum. His percentage of votes increased from 53.8 to 56.4 and 59.1 over the past three years. He was over 75% as recently as last week, but that number took a hit, as it usually does, with the final wave of ballots.</p>
<p>Hall of Fame Weekend will be July 24-27, with the induction ceremony scheduled for Sunday, July 26, in Cooperstown, N.Y.</p>
<p>Bonds’ candidacy is obviously affected by his entanglement in baseball’s steroid era, the fact that he's basically the poster boy for that mess. Both he and Roger Clemens remain on the outside looking in, along with several others.</p>
<p>Bonds hit an all-time best 762 home runs during a 22-year career that began with the Pirates in 1986. Included in there was MLB’s single-season record — 73 in 2001. Talking strictly baseball, there's zero debate over Bonds’ validity here: seven MVPs, 12 times in the top 10, 14 All-Star nods, eight Gold Gloves, on and on.</p>
