<h1>PPG trying to 'limit impact' of COVID-19 on global operations </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With an automotive coatings plant in Wuhan, China —&nbsp;the place where the deadly coronavirus is believed to have originated —&nbsp;and operations spread across 70 countries worldwide, Downtown-based PPG has been experiencing the economic fallout from the global pandemic longer than many U.S. businesses.</p>
<p>Company Chairman and CEO Michael McGarry said Thursday that the paints giant won’t know the full hit the company will take “for some time.”</p>
<p>Addressing shareholders during a virtual annual meeting, Mr. McGarry reviewed PPG’s 2019 results and said details about how COVID-19 has affected its performance since January won’t be discussed until a first-quarter earnings call on April 28.</p>
<p>PPG&nbsp;— which produces coatings for automakers and other industries that have experienced dramatic slowdowns during the coronavirus crisis —&nbsp;continues “to take proactive actions to limit the impact as much as possible,” Mr. McGarry said.</p>
<p>Asked by a shareholder whether PPG has applied for assistance through the federal government’s $2 trillion relief package known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, he said the company hasn’t yet but is studying its provisions.</p>
<p>“We’re confident our business is in good shape and we will continue to monitor the virus moving forward,” he said.</p>
<p>Its plant in Wuhan, which employs 35 and makes automotive coatings, was shuttered from Jan. 20 to March 23.&nbsp;PPG has 3,800 employees throughout China and all its facilities there are back up and running.</p>
<p>The company adjusted operations at manufacturing sites in Milan, Italy, and elsewhere as the virus raged in Europe and other regions. Some plants in Italy remain closed, PPG said.</p>
<p>In the U.S., its manufacturing sites are considered essential businesses that may continue to operate with safety precautions including split shifts and social distancing.</p>
<p>Its retail paint stores are providing pickup and delivery services.</p>
<p>Uncertainty about the virus will result in PPG taking a “conservative approach” to acquisitions in 2020, Mr. McGarry said.</p>
<p>Last year, the company spent $700 million in cash to acquire four businesses that make automotive and aerospace coatings products.</p>
<p>It closed on two deals in the first quarter: Industria Chimica Reggiana, an Italian coatings maker; and Alpha Coating Technologies, a West Chicago firm that makes powder coatings for light industrial applications. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.</p>
<p>PPG sales last year totaled $15.1 billion, down 1.5% from 2018. Net income slipped to $1.2 billion, or $5.22 per share, down from $1.3 billion, or $5.40 per share in 2018.</p>
<p>Shareholders Thursday approved the appointment of Kathleen Ligocki to PPG’s board effective immediately.&nbsp;Ms. Ligocki is the former chief executive of Agility Fuel Solutions, former president and chief executive of Harvest Power, and a former operating partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the PPG Foundation committed more than $1.5 million to COVID-19 relief efforts in the Pittsburgh region and other locations where it operates.</p>
<p>The funding includes $275,000 for the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank and the Emergency Action Fund at the Pittsburgh Foundation.</p>
<p>Other grants include $150,000 for Feeding America which supports food banks nationwide; $375,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for efforts in communities in Europe, Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East; $168,000 to the Chinese Red Cross Foundation; and $520,000 for local organizations serving people at risk in communities worldwide where PPG has facilities.</p>
<p>The company also donated more than 290 gallons of anti-bacterial paint to Shanghai Tong Ren Hospital; and is doubling a match program for employee contributions in the U.S. and Canada to nonprofits involved in COVID-19 support.</p>
<p>Employee gifts will be matched at a two-for-one rate through May 31, PPG said.</p>
