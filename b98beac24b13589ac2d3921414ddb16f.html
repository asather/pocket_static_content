<h1>Ted Cruz to self-quarantine after contact with CPAC attendee infected with coronavirus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sen. Ted Cruz will self-quarantine in his Texas home after a person he had a “brief conversation and a handshake” with at the recent CPAC conference tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
<p>“I’m not experiencing any symptoms, and I feel fine and healthy,” the Republican said Sunday in a statement, adding that authorities have advised him that the odds of transmission given their brief interaction was “extremely low.” Those who’ve interacted with him in the last 10 days “should not be concerned about potential transmission,” medical authorities have advised him.</p>
<p>Cruz informed Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and incoming White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows of the situation.</p>
<p>Cruz said he will remain home until a full 14 days have passed since the interaction at the conservative political conference, where President Donald Trump and Pence spoke. Cruz said the Conservative Political Action Conference interaction was 10 days ago.</p>
<p>Cruz’s statement came as a&nbsp;growing sense of concern and uncertainty about the reach of the novel coronavirus has begun to take hold in the White House.</p>
<p>Trump was photographed shaking hands with Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union who confirmed that he had been in direct contact with the infected man during CPAC.</p>
<p>The handshake at CPAC put Trump just two degrees of separation away from the virus.</p>
<p>The CPAC organizer, the American Conservative Union, said the attendee was exposed to the virus before the four-day event and tested positive for it Saturday.</p>
<p>“This attendee had no interaction with the president or the vice president and never attended the events in the main hall,” the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>The attendee has been quarantined in New Jersey, the statement said.</p>
