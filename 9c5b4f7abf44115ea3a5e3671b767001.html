<h1>Paul Zeise: Two picks will tell the tale of this year's draft for the Steelers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of the most useless exercises annually done is grading of team’s NFL draft classes five seconds after the draft is over. There is no way to know which team did the best and which team did the worst until about five years from now, when all of these players have a chance to show what they can do.</p>
<p>The road to 5-11 seasons is littered with teams draft&nbsp;“experts” gave an A or A+ for their drafts, and conversely the road to 11-5 seasons is paved with teams who initially got poor grades. It is a crap shoot and you never know which players will actually pan out and which players won’t.</p>
<p>I’ll give one example off the top of my head. The Steelers draft class of 2016 was generally well-regarded. Mel Kiper Jr., gave it a B as did Chris Burke of Sports Illustrated. That grade says to me that the Steelers got good value with their first round pick and also got a few good players to build around for the next six or seven years.</p>
<p>Here we are in 2020, and there isn’t one player from that 2016 class still on the roster. Not one. The first-round pick, Artie Burns, was a total bust and the second-round pick, Sean Davis, was serviceable for a few years and not much more. The fourth-round pick Jerald Hawkins, was a deep reserve and was traded; the sixth-round pick, Travis Feeney, didn’t make the roster; and the first seventh-round pick, DeMarcus Ayers, made it one season before getting cut.</p>
<p>That’s a whole lot of of wasted picks on players who either were barely average or quite simply not good enough. The class is salvaged by the fact that the third-round pick, Javon Hargrave, turned out to be a pretty good player and the other seventh-round pick, Tyler Matakavich, was a pretty good special teams player.</p>
<p>Still, one good player and one good special teams player out of seven picks is not the work of a B student. It probably deserved a C- or D+ in retrospect, but that is with the benefit of five years of hindsight.</p>
<p>This class the Steelers put together seems to be made up of safe picks that fill needs. They took what appears to be really good football players that were productive in college and helped them shore up a couple of key spots. They got some depth for their defense, they added some playmakers on offense and got a little help for special teams, as well.</p>
<p>This class, though, will ultimately be judged by the impact from two players — second-round pick Chase Claypool and fourth-round pick Anthony McFarland, Jr.&nbsp; The Steelers need to get value out of some of their other picks, and it wouldn’t hurt if Alex Highsmith becomes a legitimate replacement for Bud Dupree, but ultimately it will come down to how those two offensive playmakers develop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claypool was surprising to some because there were a number of other receivers that were said to be on the Steelers’ wish list leading up to the draft. Also, when they picked, two running backs — Cam Akers and J.K. Dobbins — were on the board and it seemed likely the Steelers would grab one of them.</p>
<p>Instead, they grabbed Claypool, who seems to have the stuff to become an excellent player in the NFL. He has great size, excellent speed, he can jump high and he catches the ball with strength. He is a receiver who uses his physicality well, and there are some who think that he is more of a hybrid tight end.</p>
<p>He needs to become a dynamic playmaker for the Steelers offense and give Ben Roethlisberger another weapon in the red zone. The knock on him is that he can’t get off the line when teams play press against him, and that’s not a great weakness to have in the NFL. He is a hard worker, though, and the Steelers believe he can develop in that area.</p>
<p>McFarland, on the other hand, was a boom or bust pick. There won’t be an in between with him. He is either going to add another dimension — speed and big-play ability — to the Steelers or he will just sort of become a guy with talent who never pans out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only time will tell if Claypool and McFarland are playmakers for the Steelers, so grading them — or any of the other players drafted this weekend — right now is mostly a waste of time.</p>
