<h1>Gov. Wolf orders all Pa. schools to remain closed for the rest of the academic year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Thursday said that all K-12 schools would remain closed for the rest of the academic year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schools in Pennsylvania have been closed since mid-March in an effort&nbsp;to limit the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>“We must continue our efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus during this national crisis,” Mr. Wolf said in a release following the announcement. “This was not an easy decision but closing schools until the end of the academic year is in the best interest of our students, school employees and families.”</p>
<p>The shutdown includes&nbsp;all public K-12 schools, brick and mortar and cyber charter schools, private and parochial schools, career and technical centers and intermediate units. Schools will be allowed to start summer programming on the day after their academic year ends, according to the state.</p>
<p>The state’s early learning programs —&nbsp;Pre-K Counts, Head Start Supplemental Assistance Program and Preschool Early Intervention — will also remain closed.</p>
<p>In addition, colleges and universities in the state cannot resume in-person instruction or reopen their campuses until Mr. Wolf allows them to open or lifts the closure of non-life-sustaining businesses.</p>
<p>The governor said he made the decision in consultation with state Education Secretary Pedro Rivera and Health Secretary Rachel Levine.</p>
<p>“While the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its mitigation efforts have created uncertainty in our schools and communities, today’s action to close schools for the remainder of the academic year provides school communities with predictability and understanding of the conditions under which they’ll be operating and serving students,” Mr. Rivera said in a statement, adding that his department would continue to work with public and private sector partners to meet the needs of students.</p>
<p>The decision to reopen schools will be based on guidance from the governor and secretary of health, Mr. Rivera said.</p>
<p><em><br></em>The state Department of Education directed all schools in Pennsylvania to devise an education continuance plan for their students. Many schools in the commonwealth have already started remote instruction for their students, while others are still in the planning process.</p>
<p>The Department of Education has offered resources to help schools implement their remote instruction plans online or in non-digital ways. The state is also funding equity grants of up to $5 million for school to buy equipment, such as laptops and internet hot spots, or for providing instructional materials, like paper lessons and coursework.</p>
<p>Last month, the state&nbsp;waived the 180 days of instruction requirement, which helped to alleviate pressure from schools that are still trying to being their remote instruction plans. Standardized testing required by the state was also canceled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in March, the governor signed Act 13 of 2020, which gave Mr. Rivera the authority to&nbsp;adjust requirements for the evaluation of professional employees and waive student teaching requirements that may not be possible in the context of school closures.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said that schools throughout the state will also continue to provide meals to students.</p>
<p>“By taking these actions, the department is providing flexibility in the near term, while signaling that core functions of public education can and will continue,” Mr. Rivera said.</p>
<p>A total of 759 positive cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed in Allegheny County by Thursday, including 12 deaths. The county said 117 people were or previously had been hospitalized with the virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
