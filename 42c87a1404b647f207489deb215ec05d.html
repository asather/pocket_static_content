<h1>Penguins, partners secure last financing needed for FNB tower at former Civic Arena site</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Penguins and their partners hope to start construction on the new First National Bank headquarters at the former Civic Arena site next spring after securing the final piece of financing.</p>
<p>Minority-owned Clay Cove Capital LLC provided the capital commitment —&nbsp;joining the team and its developer, the Buccini/Pollin Group, as equity investors in the $230 million, 26-story office tower.</p>
<p>The amount invested was not disclosed.</p>
<p>In an announcement Thursday, the Penguins stated the new investment paves the way for a 2021 second-quarter groundbreaking at the 28-acre lower Hill District site.</p>
<p>The new tower, to be built at the west end of the site closest to Downtown, will be called FNB Financial Center. The bank will anchor the building, with more than 160,000 square feet of space spread over nine floors as well as options for expansion.</p>
<p>When first announced, the Penguins and FNB had hoped to start construction in the third quarter of this year. That has not happened, in part because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought a halt to construction activities for more than a month and impacted real estate markets.</p>
<p>Amachie K. Ackah, Clay Cove Capital co-founder and managing partner,&nbsp;called the investment a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”</p>
<p>“The mixed-use project aligns well with our investment portfolio by creating high value for both the community and its investors.” he said.</p>
<p>“Clay Cove, its partners and its investors are extremely excited to be a part of the Hill District community for a long time to come and hope to add new chapters of reinvestment to the lower Hill’s incredible story.”</p>
<p>According to the announcement, Clay Cove, based in Portland, Maine, has invested in more than $1 billion worth of commercial real estate projects since its founding in 2014.</p>
<p>The Buccini/Pollin Group has partnered with the firm in the past, most notably in the acquisition of the Peoples Center office building on the North Shore several years ago.</p>
<p>“Their crucial investment advances progress on a project that will spark development across the rest of the Lower Hill and in the adjacent neighborhoods,” said Chris Buccini, Buccini/Pollin managing partner.</p>
<p>FNB also is seeking a $15 million state redevelopment assistance capital grant to help fund construction of the building.</p>
<p>In its deal to locate on the site, the bank has agreed to advance $11 million in investment to the middle and upper Hill. It’s part of a plan to use tax revenue generated by the development to help other parts of the neighborhood. The FNB share would be paid when it closes on the land needed for its headquarters.</p>
<p>The new FNB tower will total 550,000 square feet in all. In addition to the office space, there will be retail and some on-site parking.</p>
<p>It is part of a broader, long-delayed redevelopment that is to feature 1 million square feet of office space, up to 1,000 residential units, an 850-space parking garage, a 400-room hotel, 190,000 square feet of retail, a food hall and an indoor-outdoor music venue to be operated by Live Nation.</p>
