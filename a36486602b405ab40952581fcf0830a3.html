<h1>Penguins mailbag: Is this the best chance at another Cup for Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome back to Mike’s Mailbag.</em></p>
<p><em>First of all, congrats. You’ve made it through four months of my crazy hypotheticals and stories about life in quarantine. Now, we’re on the cusp of real hockey. The NHL and the NHLPA have reached a tentative agreement on Phase 3 and Phase 4 protocols, as well as a collective bargaining agreement that will ensure labor peace through at least 2025-26. The full NHL membership is currently&nbsp;voting on this deal, and t</em><em>he final results are expected Friday, which should pave the way for training camps to begin July 13.</em></p>
<p><em>While I’m sure you’re all still itching to know which cooking shows I’m binge watching and my thoughts on Hamilton, let’s — finally — talk some hockey.</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> If the Penguins lose, they could have a shot at the No. 1 pick. [All eight teams that lose in the qualifying round will have the same 12.5% shot, based on the results of the draft lottery]. With stars like Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin getting older, should they tank for Alexis Lafreniere?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> To use a Pirates reference, I respect your desire to see what’s inside the box of mystery. But tanking would be a wild move.</p>
<p>The Penguins have been doing everything in their power to maximize the Crosby-Malkin window. This year is a perfect example, when they gave up their top prospect, Calen Addison, and a conditional first-round pick for Jason Zucker. Why change course now and play for the future when the prospect pool has been thinned and draft picks are somewhat limited?</p>
<p>On top of that, even if the Penguins did somehow end up with the No. 1 overall pick, this could very well be the their best chance to win another Cup in the near future. The time off means Crosby, Malkin, Kris Letang, Patric Hornqvist, Jake Guentzel, Bryan Rust, etc., are all healthy and in their prime. There’s no guarantee that will ever happen again. On top of that, they have two goalies they trust in the playoffs. As soon as this offseason, one might be gone. Other free agents such as Justin Schultz might also feel the pinch of the salary cap crunch and find new homes by the time 2020-21 rolls around.</p>
<p>Win now. Leave the box of mystery to the losers.</p>

<p><strong>Brian:</strong> What’s going on with the hub cities? I thought the NHL didn’t want to have any teams playing in their home arenas, but now Edmonton and Toronto will both be at home.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> You’re right. Initially, when the 24-team format was announced, commissioner Gary Bettman said the league was sensitive to “perceived advantages” that might come with a team playing in its home arena. I guess they didn’t feel it was that big of a deal. And I don’t blame them.</p>
<p>Some might say there’s value to knowing your own boards. Or maybe there’s a psychological advantage to playing in a familiar arena. But how much is that really going to be a factor? Home ice advantage is only really an advantage when there are 20,000 screaming fans swaying the momentum. No fans, no advantage. And even then, consider that all five of the Penguins’ Stanley Cup-clinching wins came on the road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, the biggest threat to awarding a Cup and doing so with integrity is COVID-19. Keeping the Maple Leafs and Oilers at home means 104 people — 52 from each club — won’t have to risk contracting the virus during their travel to the hub city. On top of that, the travel for each team will be much more convenient, which might slightly decrease the risk of the other 22 teams becoming exposed on their way to their playoff destinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chris J.:</strong> How will this layoff affect the quality of play?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> The NHL made the right call by letting players skate informally for five weeks during Phase 2. Still, this is a fair question, considering it will have been about 20 weeks since the Penguins’ last game.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, Mike Sullivan fielded a similar question last week.</p>
<p>“I can assure you this, the competition is going to be fierce,” he said. “As play starts to resume and more games guys get under their belt, the quality of execution will continue to improve.”</p>
<p>This is where I truly believe there are advantages to the Penguins playing in the so-called “qualifying” round. Yes, there’s a shot their postseason hopes could end before they even reach a seven-game series. But if they can avoid catastrophe against the Canadiens, this extra series will give the Penguins three-to-five real, do-or-die games to get that touch and timing back before playing one of the top seeds.</p>
<p><strong>Lynn:</strong> Do you think any Penguins will opt out?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> After the NHL players officially vote to ratify the collective bargaining agreement and the return-to-play protocol, they’ll have 72 hours to notify their club that they plan to opt out. Sullivan said no one has told him they have any desire to skip the playoffs. Barring a last-minute change of heart, the Penguins should have their full roster. We’ll know for sure by Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking lately about what I would do if I were an NHL player.&nbsp;There might be no safer place to be in the world than inside the NHL’s bubble. The way I see it, there’s less of a chance of getting the virus in a secure area where everyone is tested daily and masks are mandatory than there would be staying at home and going to the grocery store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of that, the NHL sweetened the pot for players to come back, doubling the playoff pool. Those who lose in the qualifying round will make $20,000 and winners of the Stanley Cup will take home $240,000.</p>
<p>The main argument I could see for opting out is that you don’t want to be away from your loved ones for up to five weeks before families join hub cities in the conference finals. Or, maybe you have a preexisting condition and feel more confident strictly quarantining yourself at home and limiting exposure to the outside world as much as possible.</p>
<p>Either way, I respect any personal choice someone makes about their own health and safety.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa N.:</strong> Glad to see the players will get to compete in the Olympics again in the new CBA. Besides Crosby and Malkin, who on the Pens do you think may get the chance to play for their country? And do you think the U.S. team has closed the gap on the Canadian team since the last Olympics the pros played in? The Canadian team is so stacked.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong>&nbsp;Let’s start here in the U.S. Guentzel feels like a very safe bet. He ranks fifth in points-per-game among active U.S.-born NHLers, just behind Patrick Kane, Auston Matthews, Johnny Gaudreau and Jack Eichel. Rust could also end up fighting for a final roster spot, especially if he keeps playing like he is now.</p>
<p>Latvian Teddy Blueger — or maybe I should say Teodors Bļugers in this context — played for his home country a number of times, including IIHF World Championships in 2017, 2018 and 2019. He currently ranks fifth all-time in NHL points with 32 among Latvian-born players. I’d expect him to make a roster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patric Hornqvist played for Sweden in the 2010 Olympics but wasn’t on the team in 2014. However, much of that 2014 team is now in retirement and Hornqvist ranks fifth among active NHL players from his country. It probably depends a bit on age and interest from him in 2022.</p>
<p>I know some segment of the Penguins fan base will roll their eyes at this, but Dominik Simon had a great tournament for Czech Republic during the 2019 World Championships, too. While there are a number of talented players from the Czech Republic, including David Pastrnak, Jakub Voracek, David Krejčí and Jakub Vrána, Simon does rank 14th among active Czech-born players in NHL points.</p>
<p>Finally, for the Canadians, maybe Kris Letang can join Crosby. But the projected rosters from many of the Canadian outlets don’t have him on there, and I trust they’ve been analyzing this more extensively than me.</p>
<p>That kind of leads into your second question. Canada is just so stacked. Our Northern neighbors will definitely be the favorite again. But I do seem to remember the United States pulling off an upset or two.</p>
