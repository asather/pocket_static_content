<h1>Allegheny County deputy public defender charged with stabbing fiance — another public defender</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Allegheny County deputy public defender has been charged with stabbing her fiance, another public defender, at their Avalon home after a “night out drinking,” according to a criminal complaint</p>
<p>Elizabeth LaForgia, 31, was charged Wednesday by Avalon police with aggravated assault, a felony, and lesser charges of simple assault and harassment.</p>
<p>Ms. LaForgia’s fiance, George Saba, 36, told police that she kicked him in the testicles and stabbed his forearm with a 12-inch kitchen knife, causing him to bleed, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Both remain active trial attorneys at the public defender’s office, but their status is under review, according to information from the county’s human resources office.</p>
<p>T. Brent McCune, Ms. LaForgia’s attorney, said his client was defending herself.</p>
<p>“These two were engaged to be married...They were. I don’t know about now...I think it is premature and almost naive to pretend to know what goes on in the privacy of a couple’s home in instances like this. There’s always two sides to these kinds of stories, and Miss LaForgia was defending herself,” Mr. McCune said.</p>
<p>“Alcohol was involved,” Mr. McCune added. He would not say who was drinking or how much.</p>
<p>“I know the whole story, but she does not want to compromise her fiance. She authorized me to say that she was defending herself,” Mr. McCune said.&nbsp;“Quite frankly, she is tearful, overwhelmed, does not want to get her fiance in trouble and is undecided” about whether she will provide police with a written statement of what occurred.</p>
<p>Mr. Saba declined comment.</p>
<p>Amie Downs, the county’s spokeswoman, would not make Chief Public Defender Matt Dugan available for an interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We don’t talk about personnel matters,” Ms. Downs said Thursday. “It is a personnel matter. It happened outside work.”</p>
<p>Avalon police responded Tuesday shortly after 11 p.m. to the house in the 400 block of California Avenue after Mr. Saba called 911.</p>
<p>He told police that he and Ms. LaForgia had an argument roughly a half-hour earlier while on their way home from drinking, the complaint said.</p>
<p>After walking into their house, the fight escalated, and Ms. LaForgia kicked Mr. Saba, the complaint said. The two began to grapple. Ms. LaForgia got a knife from the kitchen and stabbed Mr. Saba while he was backed up against the front door, the complaint said.</p>
<p>They grappled with each other again, according to the complaint. It was not clear from the court paperwork what brought the incident to an end.</p>
<p>Police saw a cut on Mr. Saba’s forearm where blood had begun to dry. Officers saw fresh blood on Mr. Saba’s clothing, the knife and the floor of both the dining room and living room.</p>
<p>Mr. Saba declined medical treatment.</p>
<p>Mr. Saba told police that he was a public defender and&nbsp;“knows the law,” the complaint said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Saba stated he just wanted to make a note of the situation and have a paper trail in the event he needed it later, and stated he did not want to press charges,” according to the complaint.&nbsp;“He also stated he would not show up to court for this incident. Officers informed Saba that we would have to treat the situation appropriately.”</p>
<p>Police spoke with a prosecutor from the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office, who told them to get an arrest warrant for Ms. LaForgia.</p>
<p>Avalon police Chief Tom Kokoski said it makes no difference where someone works when it comes to filing charges in a domestic dispute when there are visible wounds.</p>
<p>“Just because our guys are arresting an attorney, we [still[ have to go by what the law says. There was obviously enough evidence for our guys to effect an arrest,” the chief said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avalon police records do not show any previous visits to the couple’s home, according to the chief.</p>
<p>Ms. LaForgia turned herself in Wednesday, was arraigned and released on non-monetary bail. The chief said a condition of her release was not to have violent contact with Mr. Saba.</p>
<p>Mr. McCune said his client was not currently staying at the couple’s home.</p>
<p>County records show that Ms. LaForgia was hired in March 2017 and earns $45,900 a year. Mr. Saba joined the office in November 2011 and has an annual salary of $53,239.</p>
