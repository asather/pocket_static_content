<h1>Two years after 'American Idol,' Gabby Barrett is ready to share her 'Goldmine' </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Among the many paths to stardom, losing a primetime TV reality show doesn’t have the highest success rate.</p>
<p>For every Adam Lambert or Jennifer Hudson, there are scores of finalists barely heard from again, outside of maybe the county fair.</p>
<p>Munhall native Gabby Barrett found herself in that precarious position in May 2018 after placing third, to Maddie Poppe and Caleb Lee Hutchinson (Poppe’s boyfriend) on the revamped “American Idol.” The finalists spent the summer on tour together, including fourth-place finisher Cade Foehner, whom the 20-year-old Barrett married last year.</p>
<p>After the tour, they all landed back home to figure out their next moves. Poppe released her debut album on Hollywood Records the following May. Barrett, despite being considered by some as the favorite to win “Idol,” was challenged with finding a way back into the spotlight.</p>
<p>“I completely understand why labels would be a little bit hesitant to sign somebody coming off of a television show, in their first glance,” Barrett said this week in an interview from her home in Nashville. “Of course, they didn’t know my backstory of me performing six years before that, but coming off of shows, we are doing covers and things, and what really makes or breaks a career is doing original music. So they didn’t know what my original music skills were going to be or if I had any.</p>

<p>“Neither did I,” she added. “I just knew that I was going to keep grinding it out.”</p>
<p>In late 2018, she got on that grind, hooking up with such Nashville hitmakers as Jon Nite and Zach Kale to work up a batch of songs, one of which was “I Hope,” a fierce revenge rocker in the vein of Carrie Underwood’s “Before He Cheats.” Released independently in January 2019, it was a surprise smash, going to No. 1 on the Country Streaming Songs chart, No. 2 on Hot Country Songs and No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
<p>Now, it’s the lead track on Barrett’s major label debut, “Goldmine,” arriving Friday on Warner Music Nashville. The album displays her fiery vocals over 12 songs, most of which seem primed for country radio, with its heavy rock crossover elements.</p>
<p>Speaking to the sonic production, Barrett said, “I think people are influenced by what their parents play around them when they’re growing up, driving in the car and stuff. So, my dad was always playing R&amp;B and classic rock — ‘70s and ‘80s rock — and I was listening to more country with my mom, so you hear all three of those throughout the album.”</p>
<p>Barrett co-wrote 11 of the 12 songs — all but the title track — on the album, which credits nearly 20 different songwriters.</p>
<p>“At first, when I got into it, I didn’t know what I was really capable of doing with writing,” she said, “because I had dabbled in it a little bit when I was 14, 15. I didn’t know what I really wanted to say through my music yet until I got a couple years older. When I got into the Nashville scene, with the Ross Coppermans and Zach Kales and Jon Nites and Nicolle Galyons, all these people who have No. 1 hits with huge celebrities, they were able to show me creative ways and right ways of formulating songs. It got the ball rolling for me, and I find that’s the best way I can write is with a bunch of other people in a room so we can bounce ideas off each other.”</p>
<p>She drew on the ups and downs of the last few years — rising to fame, falling in love, starting from scratch, scoring a breakout hit — to create a portrait of her life at 20.</p>
<p>“This album is really made up of just who I am, one, and things that I want to say, but also there are songs on there that are actually written before ‘I Hope,’ like ‘Rose Needs a Jack,’ and then it goes all the way to songs that were written this year. So it’s really two years of songs that I’ve really been digging into and writing about stories and things that have been happening in my life.”</p>

<p>Among the songs near and dear to her are “The Good Ones,” inspired by her relationship with Foehner, and “Strong,” a gospel ballad about her love for Jesus, sung with Texas duo Shane &amp; Shane.</p>
<p>“My faith is a large part of who I am and I am blessed to have been able to include a Christian song on the album. I was influenced by gospel and Christian music from a very young age,” Barrett said. “That would probably be the most important song to me on there, especially given the times right now. People just need to hear a positive message, a foundation they can grab onto.”</p>
<p>The album is bookended by the “I Hope” single and a newly released version with Charlie Puth, the piano-pop star who wrote and recorded the mega-hit “See You Again” with Wiz Khalifa. It started when Puth put a screenshot of “I Hope” on his Instagram.</p>
<p>“He tagged me in it,” Barrett said, “and I was going through my direct messages on Instagram trying to reply to fans, and I saw his verified check. So, I clicked on it and he had messaged me and said, ‘Oh my gosh, this song is like killer.’ I was like, ‘Oh, thank you so much!’ My sister and I were fans of him through high school.”</p>
<p>He messaged back asking if he could remix the song and she said “of course,” figuring it would be some kind of club remix.</p>
<p>“So, a few days go past and he said, ‘Hey, check this out,” and he sent me a file and I clicked it and I’m going through the song and the second verse hits and it’s his vocals on the song and I’m like ‘Oh my gosh, he meant singing on the song,” which is even better. So our teams got together and quickly we came up with a new version of the song that we were able to release for fun during quarantine.”</p>
<p>Barrett was supposed to spend the summer on tour with Brad Paisley, but that fell by the wayside due to the pandemic. Like most tours, it might just be pushed to next year. She says to keep an eye for a livestream she will be doing to promote the record,</p>
<p>In September, she can look forward to the Academy of Country Music Awards, where she is nominated for best new female artist.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe how much stuff has come from ‘I Hope,’ seriously. If you would have told me two years ago that all this stuff is going to happen — with the song going No. 1 and the ACM nomination — I would’ve told you you were nuts.”</p>
