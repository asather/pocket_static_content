<h1>Gov. Wolf says restaurants can move to 50% indoor capacity if they 'self-certify'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf said on Tuesday that restaurants will be allowed to operate at 50% capacity starting Sept. 21 as long as they “self-certify” that they are following COVID-19 safety orders and guidelines.</p>
<p>Restaurants across the state have been limited to 25% indoor capacity since July.</p>
<p>Each restaurant will have until Oct. 5 to complete an online self-certification process.</p>
<p>“The self-certification ensures that restaurants can expand indoor operations and commit to all appropriate orders so that employees and customers alike can be confident they are properly protected,” Mr. Wolf said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Social distancing and mask wearing are still required.</p>
<p>Also starting Sept. 21, any establishment that serves alcohol must end alcohol service at 10 p.m.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;self-certification process is modeled after a similar system used in Connecticut.</p>
<p>Restaurants that “self-certify” will appear in what is being called the Open and Certified Pennsylvania searchable online database of certified restaurants that consumers can search&nbsp;to find certified businesses in their area. The eateries will also receive signage to display at their location indicating that they are certified businesses.</p>
