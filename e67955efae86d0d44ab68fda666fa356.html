<h1>City pension board takes first steps in exploring divestment from fossil fuels, guns and for-profit prisons</h1>

<p>The city of Pittsburgh’s pension board took the first step Thursday toward exploring divesting from fossil fuels, firearms manufacturers and for-profit prisons -— a move that Mayor Bill Peduto <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/06/05/Mayor-Peduto-wants-pension-funds-divested-from-fossil-fuels-firearms-and-for-profit-prisons/stories/201906050106" target="_blank">requested in June</a>.</p>
<p>At its first-quarter meeting, the comprehensive municipal pension trust fund board unanimously voted to form a three-member study subcommittee, comprised of new board vice president Mark DePasquale, of the city’s Department of Public Works; City Controller Michael Lamb; and board treasurer and Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #1 member Rich Ruffolo, who will lead the group.</p>
<p>“I think it is very prudent that we look at this very carefully,” said Ralph Sicuro, board chairman. “I don't think the subcommittee should have a time frame put on them to have to return a result. ... They should be telling us in an update how long they think it will take before they will be ready.”</p>
<p>The board heard from three guest presenters, including two representatives from the New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office, who by phone talked about NYC’s plan to begin divesting from fossil fuels in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In-person was Tom Sanzillo, of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, who showed in a slide presentation that fossil fuel stocks currently make up 3.9% of the S&amp;P 500, as opposed to the 28% they had in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“They are not the lions they once were,” said Mr. Sanzillo, director of finance for the international nonprofit and former New York state deputy comptroller.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto on June 5 issued a letter to the pension board requesting that they&nbsp;“develop and execute&nbsp;a divestment strategy” from fossil fuel companies “that have contributed to and are exacerbating climate change”; from firearms and ammunition manufacturers that “contribute to mass casualties”; and from for-profit prisons that “are profiting off vulnerable inmates.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marquette Associates, the city’s financial consultant, estimates that less than 2% of the city’s funds are invested in those industries, according to paperwork handed to the committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city’s combined municipal, police and fire pensions are at 60.57% funded at $813.9 million.</p>
<p>In other motions, the board voted to renew Marquette’s contract, which expires in May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Council President Theresa Kail-Smith and Mr. DePasquale abstained from that vote.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb was absent. Mr. Peduto was out of the office following the death of his mother.</p>
