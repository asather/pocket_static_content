<p>If the audience cannot get to the movies, the movies will go to them.</p>
<p>NBCUniversal announced Monday it will make available as video on demand (VOD) a number of its current and upcoming headliners.&nbsp;“Trolls World Tour” has an April 10 theatrical release and will be available for home rental that day.</p>
<p>Other films currently in theaters, including&nbsp;“The Hunt” and&nbsp;“The Invisible Man,” could be available as early as this weekend.</p>
<p>Citing unprecedented closings of movie houses due to the threat of the novel coronavirus, The Hollywood Reporter indicates Universal’s films will be available on various on-demand services for a 48-hour rental period. Price is suggested at $19.99 in the United States.&nbsp;“Emma,” a Focus Feature, will also be an early release.</p>
<p>THR reports this is not a blanket policy; releases will be made on a film-by-film basis.</p>
