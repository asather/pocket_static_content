<h1>Bedbug discovery leads to early dismissal for some South Allegheny students</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>South Allegheny School District said it would dismiss middle and high school students early on Tuesday after a bedbug was found at the school building.</p>
<p>The district said a pest control specialist would treat the entire building even though finding one bedbug does not necessarily mean there is an outbreak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>High school students were dismissed at 11:20 a.m., and middle school students were expected to be released at 12:45 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>District officials said the building would be off limits for after-school activities. Athletic practices have been moved to South Allegheny Elementary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school was expected to reopen as usual on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The South Allegheny School District is about 10 miles south of Pittsburgh and serves more than 1,500 students from&nbsp;Glassport, Liberty, Lincoln and Port Vue.</p>
<p>Bedbugs are reddish-brown and small, flat, parasitic insects roughly the size of Lincolnâ€™s head on a penny that feed solely on the blood of people and animals while they sleep.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bedbugs are not a sign of cleanliness of living conditions and can be found anywhere.</p>
<p>Although bedbugs do not spread infectious disease, they affect each person differently, ranging from small bite marks and itching to a serious allergic reaction, the CDC said.&nbsp;The best way to treat bites is to avoid scratching the area and to apply antiseptic creams or lotions and take an antihistamine.</p>
