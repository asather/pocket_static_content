<h1>Steelers' defense lacks depth at key positions, but Keith Butler thinks he has some answers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers defensive coordinator Keith Butler has been part of some great defenses during his 18-year tenure as an assistant coach in Pittsburgh. He was the linebackers coach on two teams that won the Super Bowl and another that lost in one. Last season, he oversaw a unit that led the NFL in sacks and takeaways and ranked among the top five in total defense and pass defense.</p>
<p>With 10 of 11 starters returning from that defense, it’s easy to see why Butler is hopeful this defense can hang with some of those others that won AFC championships.</p>
<p>“I’ve been fortunate to be on some good defenses here,” Butler said Tuesday morning during a Zoom call with reporters. “We’ll wait and see as the year plays out, but we think we have a pretty good defense.”</p>
<p>Describing the 2019 defense as&nbsp;“pretty good” would be selling it quite a bit short. Butler had three All-Pros in defensive lineman Cam Heyward, safety Minkah Fitzpatrick and outside linebacker T.J. Watt. The only starter that is not returning is defensive lineman Javon Hargrave, who signed as a free agent with the Eagles. But Butler is replacing him with Stephon Tuitt, who was playing as well as any defensive lineman in the league before he was placed on injured reserve with a pectoral injury last October.</p>
<p>Injuries are going to happen, and the big question facing Butler’s unit is depth, specifically at safety and linebacker.</p>
<p>The top backups at inside linebacker behind Devin Bush and Vince Williams are Robert Spillane and Ulysees Gilbert. Spillane has dressed for 10 games over his first two seasons in the league. Gilbert dressed for seven games last season and played only on special teams before a back injury put him on injured reserve for the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>General manager Kevin Colbert shored up the safety depth in July when he signed Curtis Riley early in training camp. Riley has 19 starts and 43 games played on his NFL resume and adds some much-needed experience behind Fitzpatrick and Terrell Edmunds. The other safeties on the camp roster — Jordan Dangerfield, Marcus Allen and rookie Antoine Brooks — have a combined three starts among them and limited experience in the back end.</p>
<p>“Do we want more good players? We’ll take all the good players we can get,” Butler said. “Do we need more good players at that position? Yeah, I think we do. I think our young guys really have to come along. There are a couple of guys showing up we think can help us. We’ll see as we go along. We don’t have a preseason to make decisions on guys like that. We have to put them in live situations. We think we’re in decent shape right now.”</p>
<p>Due to the depth and experience issues at inside linebacker and safety, cornerback Cam Sutton is the leading candidate to replace Mark Barron as dime linebacker. Barron was released with one year remaining on his contract after he played the second-most snaps among inside linebackers last season.</p>
<p>“His best attribute is he can play multiple positions for us,” Butler said of Sutton. “We like that out of him. Even though he might not be a so-called starter for us, he’s still going to play a lot for us. He’s going to play quite a bit. When we go to our dime package he’s probably going to be our next guy in playing our dime position.”</p>
<p>Defensive backs coach Tom Bradley said Sutton is valuable because he’s like putty. “We can put him anywhere,” he said.</p>
<p>Sutton is the top backup at nickel corner behind Mike Hilton and very well could be the top backup at outside corner if Justin Layne doesn’t earn that job. He’s also capable of dropping back and playing safety.</p>
<p>That’s why Gilbert, Allen and Brooks have to develop because there will come a time when Sutton has to play corner or safety due to injuries. Allen, a fifth-round pick in 2018, is having his best camp to date, according to Bradley, and could emerge as an option in sub-packages, as well.</p>
<p>The Steelers seem a bit more pleased with their depth at outside linebacker, which was a big concern before the draft after top backup Anthony Chickillo departed in free agency. But third-round pick Alex Highsmith is emerging as a candidate to be the top backup behind Watt and Bud Dupree. He’s competing with third-year pro Ola Adeniyi and second-year pro Tuzar Skipper.</p>
<p>Head coach Mike Tomlin heaped the praise on Highsmith on Monday afternoon, and Butler also commended his progress in his first NFL camp.</p>
<p>“Alex has really shown that he belongs in the NFL,” Butler said. “Do we really know that until we get into live action? Probably not. But what we’ve seen him do in practice is encouraging in terms of us putting him in and having enough confidence in him that when he goes in, there won’t be a huge drop-off.”</p>
<p>Watt, for one, believes Highsmith can step in when he and Dupree need a rest. Chickillo, Adeniyi and Jayrone Elliott combined to play about 14 snaps per game behind Watt and Dupree. The Steelers figure a similar number this year will be needed out of Highsmith, Adeniyi and Co.</p>
<p>“I think Alex has done a great job just being ready in these tough circumstances of being a rookie,” Watt said. “He knows the defense really well. He’s making all the proper calls. He’s asking all the right questions. I think he can definitely fill in when we need them. Bud and I found out last year we can’t play the full game. We can’t play every single snap if we’re going to play to our fullest potential.”</p>
