<h1>The NHL's flat salary cap will lead to 'hard decisions' for Penguins GM Jim Rutherford</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Friday’s news from the NHL gave hockey fans a reason to look forward to Aug. 1. Players got a clear picture of what their road to the Cup looks like. Owners got labor peace through 2025-26.</p>
<p>And Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford? He got a budget.</p>
<p>The salary cap was scheduled to expand from $81.5 million this year to somewhere between $84 million and $88.2 million next season. However, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the NHL and the players association went back to the negotiating table to hammer out an extension to the collective bargaining agreement, taking into consideration the economic consequences of canceled regular season games and empty postseason arenas.</p>
<p>Under the collective bargaining agreement ratified by the players on Friday, the salary cap will stay flat at $81.5 million. It will remain there until hockey-related revenue returns to pre-pandemic levels of $4.8 billion, which will probably be at least one more season after next.</p>
<p>“The nice thing about the flat cap is we know where it’s at now and where it’s going to go in the next few years,” Rutherford said. “It gives all the teams stability. We have a better idea of what we’re dealing with.”</p>
<p>For the Penguins, the news is mixed.</p>
<p>It could have been worse — much worse — if the players hadn’t ratified the new CBA. Some national reporters estimated the cap could have fallen to around $60 to $65 million, which obviously would have been a major challenge for the Penguins who have more than $68 million committed to next year.</p>
<p>But just because it’s not bad doesn’t mean this $81.5 million cap is great for the Penguins, who are always doing some salary-cap gymnastics to fit all of its stars under one checkbook.</p>
<p>“The decisions are always tough for us,” Rutherford said. “We know every year we’re up against the cap. We’re always in a position where we have to move things around.”</p>
<p>Let’s take an early look.</p>
<p><strong>Under Contract</strong></p>
<p>One positive for the Penguins is the core is intact — not only through 2020-21 but through 2021-22.</p>
<p>The following players all have at least two years left on their deals:</p>
<p>Add it up. That’s essentially all of the top-six forwards and the top-four defensemen.</p>
<p>However, the Penguins will still need to be careful, and possibly a little creative, with how they spend the rest of the roughly $13.225 million in cap space. That is unless of course they hope to create a little more via trade.</p>
<p>Three unrestricted free agents and eight restricted free agents will be part of that difficult decision-making process.</p>
<p><strong>Restricted Free Agents</strong></p>
<p>Like everything else this season, the discussion always starts with the goalies. Matt Murray and Tristan Jarry are both scheduled to be restricted free agents at season’s end.</p>
<p>If the Penguins want to keep Jarry on a bridge deal, Columbus’ Elvis Merzlikins might be an interesting comparison. Merzlikins signed a two-year deal with an average annual value of $4 million after an impressive rookie season with a 2.35 goals-against average and .923 save percentage.</p>
<p>Jarry has about the same level of experience and has similar stats in a small sample size, posting a .921 save percentage and 2.43 goals-against average on the way to earning a nod in his first All-Star Game. It seems reasonable to think Jarry could command a salary between $3 million to $4 million, either with Pittsburgh or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Murray is tougher to estimate, due to his stellar postseason record and inconsistency in the regular season. Maybe somewhere between $5.1 million that Jimmy Howard makes and $6.4 of John Gibson? Keeping two under this scenario could be a challenge without trading away a skater.</p>
<p>The other major restricted free agents include Jared McCann and Dominik Simon. Neither one is easy to define. McCann tallied 28 points in the season’s first 44 games (14 goals, 14 assists), but hasn’t scored in his past 22. Meanwhile, Simon will be coming back from labrum surgery.</p>
<p>Mid-season call-ups Sam Lafferty and Anthony Angello, plus defenseman Juuso Riikola, round out the restricted free agents.</p>
<p><strong>Unrestricted Free Agents</strong></p>
<p>Justin Schultz was not himself during an injury-marred season. The $5.5 million he made this year will be tough to fit in the budget, even though letting him walk also means opening up one of the biggest holes in the lineup.</p>
<p>Deadline-day additions Conor Sheary (who counted $3 million against the cap this year) and Patrick Marleau (who is playing for the veteran minimum of $700,000) also will be unrestricted at season’s end.</p>
<p>The Penguins never wanted to give up Sheary in the first place, but traded him to Buffalo during a salary-cap crunch. Was he just a rental or something more? Marleau hinted a reunion with San Jose could be possible, but if he’s willing to play for the minimum again, the Penguins won’t find many better players at that value.</p>
<p>The flat salary cap only adds one more variable to a season that was paused and will now resume under unprecedented circumstances.</p>
<p>“That 70 games, we have a good picture,” Rutherford said. “But depending how long the playoffs go and how players play, that can certainly change [the opinion of] the people in our organization that contribute to that decision.”</p>
