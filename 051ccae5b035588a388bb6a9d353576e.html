<p>The co-founder of Pittsburgh’s first billion-dollar startup, Duolingo, says the Trump administration’s immigration policies could force him to move jobs to Canada.</p>
<p>Luis von Ahn, CEO of the&nbsp;language learning company, expressed&nbsp;his concerns on Twitter Monday:</p>
<p>”I’m proud that @duolingo, the most valuable startup in PA, is seen as an inspiration for Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, if the US policies against (extremely qualified) immigration continue, we’ll be forced to move jobs (and inspiration) to Toronto,” the CEO said.</p>
<p>In his tweet, von Ahn tagged Pennsylvania Sens. Pat Toomey, a Republican, and Democrat Bob Casey, along with Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto.</p>
<p>The mayor responded via Twitter, saying, “Duolingo isn’t alone. Pittsburgh’s economy depends on attracting brightest minds from around the world. That’s why corporate leaders, universities, Mayors, hospitals, foundations &amp; non-profits are united in protecting the rights of immigrants and visas required to make PGH home.”</p>
<p>East Liberty-based Duolingo, founded in 2011, employs more than 300 people.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/06/22/green-card-ban-freeze-extended-work-visas-Donald-Trump-administration-H1B-H2B-J1-L1-coronavirus-asylum-seekers/stories/202006220091" target="_blank">signed an order last month</a> temporarily blocking migrants from using a variety of employment-based visas to work in the U.S., including the H-1B for highly-skilled workers such as computer programmers. The restrictions, which will last at least until the end of the year, will keep hundreds of thousands of temporary workers from getting jobs in U.S. industries ranging from high-tech to landscaping.</p>

<p>“As immigration laws continue to become more restrictive or create more uncertainty, we are seeing a trend where foreign workers prefer to work in countries with more favorable immigration policies,” Duolingo’s vice president of people Christine Rogers-Raetsch said in a statement. “We are concerned about the future of entrepreneurship in the United States as a result."</p>
<p>The tech community also pushed back when <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2017/01/31/Pittsburgh-tech-companies-Schell-Games-Duolingo-Google-Uber-Lyft-react-to-Donald-Trump-immigration-order/stories/201701310106" target="_blank">Trump in 2017 issued an executive order</a> barring immigration from seven countries.</p>
