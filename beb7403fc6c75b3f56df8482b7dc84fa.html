<p>Walmart announced on Tuesday the implementation of a daily, one-hour grocery pickup time slot for at-risk shoppers in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>According to a statement, at-risk shoppers include those over 60 years old, first responders, customers with disabilities and anyone designated high-risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The time slot is from 7-8 a.m. at select pickup store locations.</p>

<p>To secure a time slot, the statement says, shoppers should visit Walmart’s grocery page and select the slot listed as “At-Risk Only."</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, families are relying on our pickup service to help get quality, fresh groceries to their homes as safely as possible,” Tom Ward, senior vice president of customer product, said in the statement. “These are extraordinary times, and we are constantly looking for ways we can help deliver that same peace of mind to all our customers, particularly those who are most at-risk.”</p>
<p>Walmart also has reserved in-store shopping time every Tuesday for customers 60 and older, until April 28. Those special senior shopping hours are for one hour before the store opens to the rest of the public, and it includes access to its pharmacies and vision centers.</p>
<p>Walmart’s current store hours are 7 a.m.-8:30 p.m, according to its website.</p>
