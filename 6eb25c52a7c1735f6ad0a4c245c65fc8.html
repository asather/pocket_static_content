<h1>Greensburg diocese suspends use of common cup out of health concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Following a similar announcement by his Pittsburgh counterpart, Greensburg Roman Catholic Bishop Edward Malesic on Thursday temporarily suspended the distribution of communion wine from a common chalice in an effort to prevent the spread of flu and the COVID-19 coronavirus.</p>
<p>The bishop also suspended the use of handshakes or other physical contact in the exchange of the ritual sign of peace during Masses. He also reminded the faithful that they are not obligated to attend Mass when sick.</p>
<p>The Greensburg diocese said the action was in response to public-health recommendations about both the seasonal flu and COVID-19.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Bishop David Zubik issued similar policies earlier this week.</p>
<p>The Greensburg diocese covers Armstrong, Fayette, Indiana and Westmoreland counties.</p>
<p>Monsignor Larry Kulick, vicar general of the diocese, wrote to priests that they should also ensure that staff drain and clean holy-water fonts weekly, that those serving communion be sure to wash hands or use anti-bacterial solution and that ushers hold doors open to minimize peopleâ€™s contact with commonly used surfaces.</p>
<p>Typically communion wine is given from a shared cup. Communion wafers will continue to be used at Mass.</p>
<p>For those with celiac disease who cannot digest the communion bread, which has gluten, the church can make provisions for them to receive communion wine individually, the diocese said.</p>
<p>During the sign of peace at Mass, worshipers typically greet other parishioners nearby with handshakes or other gestures such as hugs. While such contact is suspended, worshipers can use gestures such as waving or nodding.</p>
