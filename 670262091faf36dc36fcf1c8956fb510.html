<h1>Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program accepting applications</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The very popular Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program is starting a little later than usual and with some changes due to COVID-19.&nbsp;The program gives qualified low-income people who are 60 or older spending money for produce at farmers markets and farm stands.</p>
<p>A positive change is that seniors can get $24 — up from $20 —&nbsp;to spend on produce. The federally funded, state-administered program is run locally by the Allegheny County Department of Human Services Area Agency on Aging.</p>
<p>This year the program begins distributing checks on June 16 using a remote application process since people aren’t able to get them at senior centers and other locations as they usually do. Eligible individuals or married couples must fill out and mail or email applications, which will be accepted through the end of September.</p>
<p>Applicants must not make more than&nbsp;$23,606 (or&nbsp;$31,894 for a two-person household). Vouchers are issued on a first-come, first-served basis, and will be mailed to applicants who qualify.</p>
<p>For more information, call the Senior Line at&nbsp;1-800-344-4319.&nbsp;To have an application mailed to you, call 412-350-4219.&nbsp;Information and applications are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Human-Services/Programs-Services/Basic-Needs/Senior-Farmers-Market-Nutrition-Program.aspx" target="_blank">www.alleghenycounty.us</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9748_2020_SFMNP_Application_updated_5.29.20_(1).pdf" target="_blank">pittsburghpa.gov</a>.&nbsp;An application also was published in the June issue of <a href="https://pittsburghseniornews.com" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Senior News</a>, which also includes a summary of the program and a list of markets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jodi Rothermund, who administers the program for the Area Agency on Aging, suggests seniors not wait to apply so they can spend their checks as the local growing season peaks this summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
