<h1>Woman arraigned in Mich. killing of security guard over mask; husband, son may be on run</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>FLINT, Mich. — A Michigan woman was formally charged Tuesday in the fatal shooting of a store security guard who refused to allow her daughter inside because she wasn’t wearing a face mask to protect against transmission of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Sharmel Teague, 45, was arraigned via video Tuesday in district court, according to the Genesee County prosecutor’s office.</p>
<p>Teague, her husband, Larry Teague, 44; and her son, Ramonyea Bishop, 23, face first-degree premeditated murder charges in Friday’s killing of Calvin Munerlyn, 43, at a Family Dollar near downtown Flint.</p>

<p>Larry Teague and Bishop have yet to be arrested and were believed to be on the run, prosecutor David Leyton said.</p>
<p>The three defendants also face gun charges. Larry Teague also is charged with violating Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order requiring all customers and employees to wear face coverings inside grocery stores.</p>
<p>Sharmel Teague argued with Munerlyn — yelling and spitting at the security guard — before leaving the store Friday afternoon, Leyton said Monday.&nbsp;It’s alleged Teague and Munerlyn got into a verbal dispute after he told the woman’s daughter she needed to wear a face mask while inside the store.</p>
<p>Two men later came to the store, and one of them shot Munerlyn in the back of the head. Witnesses identified Bishop as the man who shot Munerlyn, according to Leyton.</p>
<p>Police were called and they found Munerlyn, a married father of nine, lying in the store. Medics took him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>No information has been released about the daughter, who has not been charged in the shooting.</p>
<p>Sharmel Teague, who’s being held in the Genesee County Jail, appeared before Judge Nathaniel Perry through a video conference Tuesday morning. She said she could not afford a private lawyer and asked the court to impose “an appropriate bond” because she has an autistic son at home.</p>
<p>Perry said he would appoint a public defender to represent her, but he rejected her second request.</p>
<p>“Because of the seriousness of this offense, she will be held without bond,” he told the court.</p>
<p>A Family Dollar spokesman said the company was cooperating fully with local authorities as they investigate the incident.</p>
<p>"We are aware of the tragic incident occurring at our Flint, Michigan store last Friday afternoon," the statement said. "As always, we are committed to ensuring a safe environment for our associates and customers. Out of respect for the family's privacy, we are not commenting further at this time."</p>
<p>A cash reward of up to $1,000 is being offered for information leading up to the arrest and conviction of Teague’s 23-year-old son and her husband, who’s a 44-year-old convicted felon.</p>
