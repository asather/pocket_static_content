<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Vice President Mike Pence heads to Ohio on Thursday for the unveiling of a new all-electric pickup truck built by the startup that took over the General Motors assembly plant shuttered last year.</p>
<p>The Republican vice president plans remarks after the reveal of the Endurance All-Electric Pickup Truck at Lordstown Motors Corp. near Youngstown, Ohio. He’ll also attend an event with law enforcement and community leaders before returning to Washington.</p>
<p>State Democratic Chairman David Pepper called the visit a “photo op” in an area where Mr. Trump failed to keep promises to 1,700 GM workers displaced by the plant’s closure. GM has since built a battery plant near the Lordstown site, employing 1,100 workers.</p>
<p>Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, who represents the Mahoning Valley, said he welcomes Mr. Pence to the region and seeks the administration’s commitment to building a robust electric vehicle market there.</p>
<p>Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he and first lady Fran DeWine won’t be visiting with Mr. Pence on Thursday because they are avoiding crowds due to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>He said during a briefing with reporters that he has not asked Mr. Pence to wear a mask, as the state Health Department advises.</p>
<p>“I am not going to tell the vice president what to do,” he said, “but this is how we all stay safe and help each other.”</p>
