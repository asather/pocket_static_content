<h1>Tax abatement: Officials need details of Westinghouse property sale</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When a company benefits from tax abatements, transparency is required. The governing bodies that provided the abatements have a right to understand transactions affecting their budgets.</p>
<p>Cranberry Township and Seneca Valley School District aren’t getting that cooperation after the sale of the Westinghouse Electric headquarters.</p>
<p>The new owners of the property must disclose the discrepancy between the announced sale price of $180 million and the $145.4 million reported in the deed transfer.</p>
<p>The lower price hits Cranberry and Seneca hard, to the tune of $175,000 apiece in deed transfer taxes. It would also cost the state $350,000.</p>
<p>If ownership won’t provide the information, officials should pull the abatements that are worth more than $1.3 million a year.</p>
<p>It’s probably no surprise that a New York investment firm is involved. The new owner, Fortress Credit Advisors LLC, specializes in undervalued and distressed properties.</p>
<p>Fortress gets a good deal, while Cranberry and Seneca get a raw deal.</p>
<p>The abatements began in 2007, so the benefits to owners past and present have been substantial. Abatements were instituted after the tract of land on which the headquarters sits was designated by the state as a strategic development area.</p>
<p>No one — not the seller, the buyer or the real estate companies involved — wants to talk to officials. The township and school district can’t even get contact information. It’s time for officials to play hardball.</p>
<p>The township and district provide certifications to the commonwealth that the owner is complying with local ordinances and regulations. No certification, no tax benefits.</p>
<p>Basically the companies involved in the sale are playing with taxpayer money. Taxpayers will cough up the difference caused by the lower transfer taxes.</p>
<p>Cranberry and Seneca officials say they don’t want a war with the new owners; they simply want transparency.</p>
<p>Taxpayers and public officials deserve to know the details of this transaction.</p>
