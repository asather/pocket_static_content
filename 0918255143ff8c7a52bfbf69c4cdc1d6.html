<h1>Penguins on pause: Injuries derail Nick Bjugstad's season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>The story of Nick Bjugstad’s season is essentially a rewriting of the injury report.</p>
<p>Just two games into the season, the 6-foot-6 forward went on injured reserve when a core muscle injury began to flare up. He returned only briefly, playing in just eight more games before he was forced to undergo surgery.</p>
<p>Initially, the Penguins estimated he’d miss at least eight weeks. It turned out to be double that. The long, non-linear rehab process was sidetracked by setbacks. In total, he was on the shelf from Nov. 15 to March 5.</p>
<p>Finally, Bjugstad returned for the Penguins’ victory over Buffalo on March 5.&nbsp;But after playing in just three games, Bjugstad’s season was once again suspended. This time, coach Mike Sullivan said he would be week-to-week with a different lower body injury not related to the surgery.</p>
<p>In total, Bjugstad played in just 13 of the 69 games, tallying one goal and one assist.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> In his first game back from injury on March 5, Bjugstad made an immediate impact. He plowed over Buffalo goalie Jonas Johansson, giving Patric Hornqvist a wide open net.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> Bjugstad missed 56 of the 69 games this season.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> The extra time off should give Bjugstad an opportunity to recover. Sullivan said the forward would be week-to-week, and it’s already been a month since the NHL paused the season. But where will he play? The right-handed Bjugstad centered the third line for three games in March, playing between Jared McCann and Patrick Hornqvist. However, in some instances, the left-handed McCann shifted to center.</p>
<p>While we’re discussing where Bjugstad will play, it’s also fair to question <em>if</em> he’ll play. Assuming Jake Guentzel, Zach Aston-Reese, Dominik Simon and Anthony Angello also return from injuries of their own, the Penguins would have 17 healthy forwards. It’s not necessarily a given that Bjugstad would crack the lineup.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Bjugstad is signed with the Penguins through the 2020-21 on a deal that carries a $4.1 million cap hit. The Penguins are almost always fighting to stay under the upper limit. The COVID-19 pandemic creates another layer of uncertainty. The cap was projected to go up from $81.5 million this year to somewhere between $84 million and $88.2 million in 2020-21. However, after all the revenue the league lost during the pandemic, it’s likely to go down instead.</p>
