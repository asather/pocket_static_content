<h1>What goalie controversy? Matt Murray worrying about Canadiens and another Cup run</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After another roller coaster regular season for Matt Murray came to a screeching halt March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the goalie hopped in his truck and headed to his lake house in Muskoka, Ontario. He was quite content to be up there with his wife, Christina, and 300-plus pounds of Newfoundland dogs.</p>
<p>The Murrays are private people. They eloped at the scenic property last June with just those two giant fluff balls, Beckham and Leo, at their side. The glimpses they’ve shared on social media suggest there aren’t many better places to isolate.</p>
<p>Safety was the goal, he said. But hitting the reset button couldn’t have hurt.</p>
<p>“It’s been, obviously, a strange time and unprecedented for us. … I would say that for the most part I sort of distanced myself from hockey and didn’t think much about it until things started ramping back up again,” he said Tuesday. “Now we’re full speed ahead in return-to-play mode and I’m just happy to be back.”</p>
<p>Murray returned to Pittsburgh – and a goalie controversy – a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old got off to another sluggish start this season, watched Tristan Jarry parlay an opportunity into an All-Star invitation and was unable to wrestle the starting job back from Jarry before the sports world suddenly shut down.</p>
<p>Murray’s .899 save percentage ranked 50th out of 57 qualifying goalies this season, though his numbers were a hair better than Jarry’s since Jan. 1.</p>
<p>Thankfully for the sport-less sports talk radio hosts who need fodder, coach Mike Sullivan and the Penguins have not publicly committed to either goalie for Game 1 of their postseason play-in series against the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<p>But it would be a surprise if it were not Murray in goal given the two Stanley Cups on his resume and that he started four of five games before “the pause.”</p>
<p>Murray, predictably, is preparing as if he’ll again be the man in the playoffs.</p>
<p>“I’m going to do everything I can do to be sharp and to be at my best to help this team win another Stanley Cup,” he said on a video call with local media.</p>
<p>For Murray, being up at the lake house wasn’t just stargazing and campfires and filling dozens of trash bags with long, black dog hair. He has a full gym there, allowing him to remain in good shape, generally speaking.</p>
<p>Nothing can replicate strapping on the pads and sliding around on ice while dudes rocket 90 mph slappers at you. To try to maintain his reflexes and puck-tracking, he spent about as much time bouncing tennis balls as Serena Williams.</p>
<p>Murray was one of many Penguins who returned to Pittsburgh when the NHL opened team facilities to players earlier this month. His group includes Evgeni Malkin, Jared McCann, Bryan Rust, Jack Johnson and Kris Letang. He said the pace and level of competition has been “really good” the past two weeks.</p>
<p>“It’s great because you see quite a few shots. … I’ve been really enjoying these skates so far and I think the work that we’re getting and what we’re able to work on is very concentrated, which I think is great,” Murray said. “And hopefully we can keep progressing and hopefully have bigger groups soon.”</p>
<p>The NHL — despite announcing Friday that 11 players around the league had tested positive for COVID-19 since Phase 2 of the return-to-play protocol began June 8 — plans to increase this week the number of players allowed inside a team facility at once. Initially, the Penguins had a maximum of six in a group.</p>
<p>Murray said he feels comfortable with the protocols currently in place.</p>
<p>“The NHL and the experts they’re consulting, I think they’re doing a great job of putting everybody in the best possible position. … That’s the Number 1 priority — the health and safety of the players and everyone else involved,” he said.</p>
<p>So he isn’t worried about getting sick right now. He also said he isn’t concerned with the contract quagmire that, with both Jarry and him slated to be restricted free agents, figures to be the top offseason story for the Penguins.</p>
<p>“That’s kind of out of my control. All I’m really focused on now is just preparing myself to be the best that I can be on the ice,” he said. “The rest of that stuff will take care of itself. So I’m not really thinking too much about that.”</p>
<p>He says he is thinking more about the Canadiens, whom he called “a dangerous team” despite having the 24th best-record among 24 playoff teams.</p>
<p>“They’re fast. They’re well-coached. They’re structured. And we know that we’re in for a huge challenge,” he said. “They’ve got a lot of really good players.”</p>
<p>Murray plans to be ready for them, whenever that series will take place.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he will let all of us obsess over all of that other stuff.</p>
<p>“I can only control what’s in my control and that’s to put in my best effort on the ice every time. The rest will take care of itself,” he said. “I know if I compete and work really hard, the rest will fall into place. So that’s where my focus is at.”</p>
