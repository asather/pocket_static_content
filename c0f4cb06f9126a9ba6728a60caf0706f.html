<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Authorities have arrested a Thornburg man in connection with an armed robbery of a convenience store in Robinson last week.</p>
<p>Allegheny County sheriff’s deputies arrested Tyler Rutherford, 33, Tuesday afternoon in the April 28 robbery at Rossi’s Market on Forest Grove Road.</p>
<p>Store employees told police that a man, wearing a hoodie and mask, entered the market armed with a rifle and demanded cash.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, sheriff’s deputies received a tip that Rutherford was in Pittsburgh’s North Side neighborhood and arrested him without incident on Cedar Avenue.</p>
<p>He was arraigned Tuesday night on charges of robbery and reckless endangerment, and is being held at the Allegheny County Jail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for July 14, according to court records.</p>
<p>Rutherford was also wanted on two bench warrants for violation of probation stemming from a theft and an escape, both in 2014. The warrants were issued on April 30 due to the alleged robbery, authorities said.</p>
