<p>WASHINGTON — Lawmakers are struggling to break a stalemate over President Donald Trump’s $250 billion emergency request for a small-business program, stoking uncertainty about when additional support will be available in a key rescue program now exhausted of funds.</p>
<p>A House session Friday was expected to simply be a pro forma meeting. A Senate session quickly adjourned Thursday without any progress.</p>
<p>Staff aides to House and Senate Democrats and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin convened another conference call on legislation to shore up the Paycheck Protection Program and demands by Democrats for potential additions. The Small Business Administration announced Thursday it has reached its $349 billion lending limit and is no longer accepting applications.</p>
<p>GOP aides said that Mr. Mnuchin is prepared to accept additional funding sought by Democrats for hospitals, but that additional aid to state and local governments couldn’t get approval in the current round. The aides spoke on condition of anonymity to characterize internal party deliberations.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Friday that more money is needed for widespread, accessible testing for COVID-19 before the economy can be reopened with confidence.</p>
<p>“Right now the testing regime is scattershot and totally inadequate for the job that’s needed to get the country back to work,” Mr. Schumer said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”</p>
<p>Republicans counter than plenty of money has already been appropriated for testing.</p>
<p>“In the last month, Congress has given federal agencies up to $38 billion to develop tests, treatments and vaccines,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate health panel. “We should start by using the money Congress has already provided, put politics aside and work together on more tests with quick results.”</p>
<p>Thursday’s Senate session featured a short speech by a frustrated majority leader, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said he had cleared the $250 billion package on the GOP side but that Democrats would have stopped it.</p>
<p>On Friday, Mr. Trump added his voice, tweeting that the “Do Nothing Democrats” should immediately return to Washington and approve the legislation. “End ENDLESS VACATION!” he wrote.</p>
<p>The Capitol is largely shuttered, requiring consensus from all sides for any legislation to pass, and top GOP leaders are vowing to stick closely to Mr. Trump’s request despite Democrats’ additional demands.</p>
<p>The Senate is away from Washington through May 4, but it convenes twice each week for pro forma sessions that could be used to pass more coronavirus aid — although only if no senator objects. The next Senate pro forma is Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>At issue is a $349 billion Paycheck Protection Program that is a centerpiece of last month’s massive rescue bill. The program gives grants to businesses with fewer than 500 workers so that they can maintain payroll and pay rent while shutting down their businesses.</p>
<p>But it has been swamped by businesses applying for loans and has reached its appropriations limit. Mr. Mnuchin says $250 billion more is needed immediately.</p>
<p>Democrats want money for hospitals burdened under COVID-19 caseloads and additional funding for states and local governments straining as the economy slides into recession.</p>
<p>They also want to the Paycheck Protection Program opened up more to businesses that don’t have established relationships with banks that have been accepting applications.</p>
