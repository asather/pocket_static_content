<h1>In Berlin, orchestra musicians gather to perform together for the first time since lockdown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the first time since March, members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra will perform together onstage in a livestream program.</p>
<p>Streaming a concert virtually is old news these days — but many musicians and listeners have been <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/coronavirus-entertainment-venues-theaters-arenas-theme-parks-1234574122/" target="_blank">pondering</a> what the entertainment scene will look like once some of the restrictions of COVID-19 have lifted.</p>

<p>The Berlin Philharmonic is charging ahead with one way forward.&nbsp;While full symphony orchestras vary in size but typically include between 80 and 100 players, only a&nbsp;small number of the Philharmonic’s musicians will perform onstage separated by the recommended six feet.</p>
<p>The program <a href="https://www.digitalconcerthall.com/en/concert/53365" target="_blank">streams</a> for free on Friday at 5 p.m. and includes Arvo Part’s&nbsp;“Fratres,” Ligeti’s&nbsp;“Ramifications” for strings, Barber’s&nbsp;“Adagio for Strings” and Mahler’s Symphony No. 4 arranged for a small ensemble. Chief conductor Kirill Petrenko will conduct.</p>
<p>The orchestra’s website is not explicit about the number of players, but the instrumentation of these pieces suggests that no more than 14 or 15 musicians will perform at one time. There will not be an audience in the hall.</p>
<p>While many orchestras, including the <a href="https://pittsburghsymphony.org/pso_home/web/community-landing" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra</a>, are offering free digital content including clips of musicians performing from home, the Berlin live stream marks the first time members of an orchestra will gather to perform since the shutdown began.</p>
