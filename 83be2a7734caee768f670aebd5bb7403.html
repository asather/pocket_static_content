<h1>Journey cancels summer tour with The Pretenders</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Journey has stopped believin’ in a summer of concerts for 2020.</p>
<p>The rock band announced Monday that it is canceling its summer tour with The Pretenders, including the July 11 show at S&amp;T Bank Music Park, due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founding member and guitarist Neal Schon, keyboardist Jonathan Cain and vocalist Arnel Pineda issued a joint statement: “There is no greater thrill for us than playing for our incredibly devoted audience, but their safety must come first. Having seen what the world has endured during the last 45 days, and not knowing what the rest of this year or 2021 will bring, we knew the right thing to do was to make sure our fans’ health was not put in jeopardy and to provide immediate access to refund options given the unexpected events caused by this terrible virus.</p>
<p>“We would like to thank all doctors, nurses, police, other first responders and essential workers for their heroic efforts; as well as our fans for doing everything possible to stay safe.</p>
<p>“We would also like to send The Pretenders our best wishes and hope to see them in the future. We will see everyone again as soon as it is safe to tour, and we will share that news as it becomes available. In the meantime, please Don’t Stop Believin’ in the wonder of life and in each other.”</p>
<p>Journey and promoter Live Nation will email ticket holders with their refund options, including a full refund or a 150% credit. Live Nation will donate the number of tickets originally purchased to healthcare workers on the front lines. For more details, visit livenation.com/refund.</p>

<p>On Friday, the reunited Rage Against the Machine moved its July 31 show at the PPG Paints Arena to Aug. 19. 2021.</p>
