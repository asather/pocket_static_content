<h1>Analysis: An in-depth look back at the Pirates’ first 30 games</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>MILWAUKEE — Let’s start by first giving the Pirates some credit: For having the fewest wins (9) in Major League Baseball through the midpoint of their season and a winning percentage (.300) that qualifies as the second-worst in the modern era of the franchise, they’ve actually accomplished a lot.</p>
<p>With the MLB trade deadline looming Monday, they might get a lot more done, too.</p>
<p>So without any delay, let’s break down what we’ve seen so far.</p>
<p><strong>Best moments</strong></p>
<p>These have, obviously, been few and far between, but a few stand out. One was Kevin Newman’s walkoff single to beat the Twins on Aug. 6, the fifth of his young career, all since the start of last season. It snapped a seven-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Last weekend, the Pirates looked extremely good in sweeping the Brewers, as Gregory Polanco went 5-for-10 with a pair of home runs and five RBIs and Chad Kuhl won his first game since 2018. Early this season, Colin Moran hit five home runs in a seven-game stretch, and Derek Shelton won his first game as an MLB manager one sweltering Sunday in St. Louis.</p>
<p>It’s not Pirates-related, but it’s easy to feel good for South Park native Randy Dobnak, who shut out the Pirates over six innings in a 5-2 Twins victory on Aug. 5, shining at the place where he spent many summers as a kid.</p>
<p>Was also fun to see Phillip Evans surprisingly make the team, then hit .359 before his season came to a crashing halt.</p>
<p><strong>Worst moments</strong></p>
<p>Little easier to pick from here, even if it’s not exactly uplifting.</p>
<p>What Derek Holland did Aug. 6 against the Tigers ranks pretty high; Holland gave up five home runs in his start, four coming on the first 11 pitches. There was the Evans/Polanco collision in right field three days later, and Lucas Giolito’s no-hitter last week — although that was pretty special to see.</p>
<p>A sneaky-bad one occurred Aug. 3 at Target Field, in another Holland start. The left-hander was cruising through five, allowing two singles and striking out five, but then the wheels came off.</p>
<p>A ball hit right at Cole Tucker sailed over his head when the new center fielder came running in. Shelton pulled Holland after he allowed a walk and a double and turned to … Miguel Del Pozo.</p>
<p>Yeah, didn’t work out. Del Pozo threw just six of his 18 pitches for strikes and allowed the Twins to break the game open.</p>
<p><strong>Remember when?</strong></p>
<p>The Toronto Blue Jays almost moved here for the summer.</p>
<p>A drone flew over Target Field, and Dovydas Neverauskas tried to hit it with a baseball? (Predictably, he missed.)</p>
<p>The Pirates went a day without trading for or claiming a project-type player off waivers? (Here’s to you Carson Fulmer, Anthony Alford, Austin Davis, Nick Tropeano and Tyler Bashlor.)</p>
<p>Guillermo Heredia, since designated for assignment, started in center field on opening night.</p>
<p>Holland had a bunch of cutouts of Rob Schneider at PNC Park because they’re friends and Schneider asked him to do it.</p>
<p>Holland was ejected from the stands, and Shelton had MLB’s first socially distanced argument with an umpire (Jordan Baker).</p>
<p><strong>Biggest disappointments</strong></p>
<p>A year after hitting .314 and finishing seventh in the National League batting race, it looks like a sophomore slump/regression for Bryan Reynolds, who entered Sunday’s game in a 1-for-21 funk and hitting just .184.</p>
<p>Similarly for Josh Bell, the Pirates first baseman is slugging just .321 (down from .569 a year ago), while he has seen his strikeout rate jump from 19.2 to 28.8%. Things have been looking better for Bell of late, but it’s hardly the start he’s wanted.</p>
<p>The entire bullpen, expected to be a strength at the start of the season, has been anything but that. Nick Burdi and Michael Feliz are out for the season. Kyle Crick has been hurt and just came back. Keone Kela got a late start because of COVID-19, then experienced right forearm tightness. It’s been tough.</p>
<p>Polanco, though, might win this one. After that glimmer of hope against Milwaukee, he doesn’t have a hit in his past 18 at-bats, with eight strikeouts. On the season, Polanco is hitting just .113 and striking out 42.5% of the time.</p>
<p><strong>First-half MVP</strong></p>
<p>While many questioned whether the Pirates should sign a “starting” catcher this offseason, Jacob Stallings has more than fine — absolutely a legit starter at this level. Consider:</p>
<p>• Entering Sunday Stallings led all National League catchers in on-base percentage at .397, while he was second in batting average at .323. Stallings actually leads all major league players with a .396 batting average in August (minimum: 50 plate appearances). The last time a Pirates catcher led MLB for a calendar month was June 1982, when Tony Pena hit .456.</p>
<p>• Stallings leads all NL players with a .462 (6-for-13) average with runners in scoring position, and his defense has been even better. Only Boston’s Christian Vazquez (8) has thrown out more runners than Stallings (5), while the Pirates catcher has the best caught stealing percentage (.455) in baseball. His Defensive Wins Above Replacement (dWAR) of 0.6 ranks first among MLB backstops.</p>
<p><strong>Other surprises</strong></p>
<p>JT Brubaker has definitely shown glimpses, but the top three involve Kuhl, Tucker and Erik Gonzalez.</p>
<p>Kuhl, who has a 2.52 ERA in six appearances (four starts) while coming back from Tommy John surgery, has been truly outstanding. He’s using his breaking stuff more, and he should. In 25 innings, Kuhl has struck out 20 and walked 11.</p>
<p>The Pirates have flaws, sure, but it’s easy to like a future rotation that includes Jameson Taillon, Mitch Keller and Kuhl … plus maybe Brubaker, Joe Musgrove, Trevor Williams and Steven Brault. Don’t forget the young arms they have developing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tucker looked more and more comfortable in center field. He has also hit the ball, starting Sunday’s game hitting .333 (12-for-36) over has past 12 games.</p>
<p>Gonzalez has been extremely good defensively and has shown signs that he may be more than a late-inning defensive replacement, enjoying a two-week stretch earlier this month where he hit .412 with six doubles, a home run and nine RBIs over nine starts.</p>
<p><strong>Unanswered questions</strong></p>
<p>When the Pirates turn things over to the kids? After the trade deadline makes sense, assuming they’re trying to showcase some guys, but why they haven’t given Ke’Bryan Hayes time to develop at third base is definitely a bit of a head-scratcher.</p>
<p>Will the fundamentals improve? That was a big focal point during spring training, and we’ve seen little meaningful progress. Baserunning blunders have happened, specifically with bad jumps on steals and getting picked off. Meanwhile, only one team has a worse fielding percentage than the Pirates (.978). Only two have made more errors than their 24.</p>
<p>Is there a bigger offensive issue here? Bell and Reynolds have regressed. Polanco, too. Of the top-six hitters in their lineup, only Moran has seen his OPS improve year-over-year, while they entered Sunday’s game with six regulars at .627 or below.</p>
<p>How serious does general manager Ben Cherington get at the trade deadline? True, performance may hinder some of what he can do, but if was able to move Jarrod Dyson, chances are here could move others, too.</p>
<p><strong>They said it</strong></p>
<p>“I really don’t want to have a wet rag in my back pocket, because — this is weird — but I’m probably going to get a butt rash, if you think about it. My crap’s going to be all wet.” — Derek Holland on, ugh, adjusting to MLB’s pitching protocols.</p>
<p>“Put a mask on. It's not that hard.” — Steven Brault talking about more adjustments.</p>
<p>“I put zeroes up last time. I got zero outs. So it was nice to do the opposite of that this time.” — Brault again after bouncing back from his disastrous outing on Aug. 7.</p>
<p>“We just kind of passed each other and head-nodded like two dudes would do.” — Bashlor on passing Stallings … and the two not really recognizing each other.</p>
<p>“I was scared because walls hurt.” — Tucker after making a sliding catch at the wall in Cleveland.</p>
<p>“I think anybody that knows me knows that I’m pissed that we wasted that much beer.” — Shelton after his first win.</p>
