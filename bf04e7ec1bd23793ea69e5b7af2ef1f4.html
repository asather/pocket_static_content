<h1>Netflix sets December premiere date for Pittsburgh-filmed ‘Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” a Netflix film adapted from Pittsburgh playwright August Wilson’s 1984 play, is officially set to premiere on Dec. 18.</p>
<p>Netflix posted on Twitter Wednesday announcing the release date of the film, which features Academy-award winner Viola Davis, who plays singer Ma Rainey, and the late Chadwick Boseman, who plays trumpeter Levee. The production was shot on Pittsburgh’s North Side last summer.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson’s play was his first to make it to Broadway, which focused on the band members hired to play a recording session for singer Ma Rainey, and then on Rainey herself, who recorded the song “Black Bottom” in 1927 and was known as the Mother of the Blues.</p>
<p>Tony Award winner George C. Wolfe directed the Netflix-adapted film, with its screenplay written by Ruben Santiago-Hudson. Denzel Washington is also a producer on the film.</p>
<p>This film marks Mr. Boseman’s final movie. Mr. Boseman — who also played Black icons Jackie Robinson, James Brown and Marvel’s Black Panther —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2020/08/28/Chadwick-Boseman-dead-dies-obituary-colon-cancer-Black-Panther-TChalla-Marvel-MCU-Jackie-Robinson-42-James-Brown/stories/202008280161#:~:text='Black%20Panther'%20star%20Chadwick%20Boseman,at%2043%20%7C%20Pittsburgh%20Post%2DGazette" target="_blank">died at the age of 43 in August</a> after battling colon cancer.</p>
<p>“He did a brilliant job, and he’s gone,” Mr. Washington said about Mr. Boseman in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/movies/chadwick-boseman-ma-raineys-black-bottom.html" target="_blank">recent New York Times article</a>.&nbsp;“I still can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>In July 2019, sections of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2019/07/09/Ma-Rainey-Black-Bottom-Viola-Davis-Pittsburgh-North-Side-Chicago-George-Wolfe/stories/201907090104?cid=search" target="_blank">Pittsburgh’s North Side were transformed</a> to replicate Chicago in the late 1920s. West North Avenue exteriors — between Brighton Road and Galveston Avenue — were repainted, restructured and decorated with props to resemble 1927 Chicago, outside the recording studio where the presence of Ma Rainey is anticipated by her session musicians.</p>
<p>In between filming, Mr. Boseman also took time to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2019/08/05/steelers-training-camp-chadwick-boseman-black-panther-ma-rainey-netflix/stories/201908050064?cid=search" target="_blank">visit a Steelers practice at Heinz Field</a> on Aug. 4, 2019.</p>
