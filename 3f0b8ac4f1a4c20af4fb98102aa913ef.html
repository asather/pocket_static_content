<h1>'Arctic cold front' to freeze region Thursday night, with a little snow too</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If Pittsburgh weather wasn’t so bipolar, you’d probably be surprised to know that temperatures — on the coaster ride that is this supposed winter season — will drop to the upper teens by Thursday night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the “coldest air we’ve seen this winter” is expected to hit the region Thursday, as temps fall from the upper 30s in the afternoon, to below 20 degrees by nightfall, according to a meteorologist at Pittsburgh’s National Weather Service in Moon.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s an arctic cold front,” said Meteorologist Myranda Fullerton.&nbsp;“We’ve got a northern disturbance bringing in all this cold air, and it’s all related to rain we’ve just received. We’re also starting to see some snow fall in Ohio. Warmer air and associated rainfall is moving out as the colder air moves in.”</p>
<p>Temperatures are likely to rebound early next week under high pressure, the local weather service reported. The Pittsburgh region can expect a small amount of snow between Thursday and Friday, and also along the I-80 north corridor, Ms. Fullerton said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regional average low this time of year is 23 degrees — which will be broken by predicted temps Thursday night.&nbsp;The average high this time of year is 40 degrees, Ms. Fullerton said. January briefly saw temps as low as 9 degrees during a cold front.</p>
<p>As rainfall from the previous couple days has slowed, waters are still elevated.</p>
<p>“The heaviest rainfall is now moving east, however, but our rivers and tributaries remain elevated,” Ms. Fullerton said.&nbsp;“It takes several hours for the levels to lower, which is why we have the advisory in effect for the Point. We expired the flash-flood watch because the heaviest rain is behind us.”</p>
<p>Drivers are asked to be cautious on roads Thursday night due to the expected freezing temps, weather service officials said.</p>
