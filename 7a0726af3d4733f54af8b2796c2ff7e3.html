<h1>Tuned In: ‘Council of Dads’ tries for ‘This is Us’ feels; ‘Resident Alien’ scares up laughs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PASADENA, Calif. – NBC keeps trying to find a touchy-feely drama to plug into the 9 p.m. Tuesday time period after “This is Us” ends its run each spring. “Rise” flopped in 2018. So did “The Village” in 2019.</p>
<p>Will “Council of Dad” fare better in 2020?</p>
<p>Another one-hour show that leads with emotion, this one follows a Savannah, Ga., family whose patriarch, Scott (Tom Everett Scott), gets a cancer diagnosis and dies by the end of the pilot but not before convening his three friends to serve as a Council of Dads in his absence.</p>
<p>Inspired by the 2010 book of the same name by Bruce Feiler (who did not die from his cancer), “Council” was adapted for TV by the husband and wife writing team of Tony Phelan and Joan Rater (“Grey’s Anatomy,” “Madam Secretary”), who said they took the idea from the book and added elements from their own lives for the TV series. Phelan and Rater have a daughter they adopted from China and a transgender son, similar to the family on “Council of Dads.”</p>
<p>“You put the four of us on a Christmas card and you wouldn’t say, ‘Oh, I get this family,’ but increasingly I think that’s the way family looks today,” Mr. Phelan said. “We were interested in telling some of those stories.”</p>
<p>Actor Clive Standen (“Vikings”), who plays one of the three members of the Council of Dads, said he was drawn to the themes of the series.</p>
<p>“The modern family is not about blood, it’s about the people who show up for you every day,” he said.</p>
<p>Sarah Wayne Callies, who plays Scott’s widow, said she felt she put a lot of violence into the world through her roles on “The Walking Dead” and “Prison Break.”</p>
<p>“I wanted something that made me feel like this, that made me feel like we’re going to be OK,” said Callies, who reported a need for boxes of tissues at table reads to catch all the tears shed. “We’re going to get through it. We might cry a little, but we got this.”</p>
<p>Ms. Rater said “Council of Dads” will not use flashbacks (“We’re very much moving forward,” she said) and while the pilot covers a year – from Scott’s diagnosis to beyond his death – future episodes will play with time, some covering a day or two, one devoted to the first run of holidays, Halloween through New Year’s, without Scott.</p>
<p>“People like to see real family stuff on TV,” Ms. Rater said. “‘This is Us’ has shown it can work and be excellent and we’re just continuing that excellent tradition with our family.”</p>
<p>The 10-episode first season of “Council of Dads” debuts at 10 p.m. March 10 behind “This is Us” for three weeks and then moves into the 9 p.m. Tuesday time slot after “This is Us” wraps its season.</p>
<p><strong>Watch for: ‘Resident Alien’</strong></p>
<p>It’s been a while since a Syfy series reeled me in (think back to “The Expanse”) but upcoming summer series “Resident Alien” may do the trick based on its clever pilot episode and a stand-out lead performance.</p>
<p>Written by Chris Sheridan (“Family Guy”) and inspired by a graphic novel of the same name, it’s the story of an alien (Alan Tudyk, “Firefly”) whose ship crashes in a small Colorado town before he can complete a mission.</p>
<p>Once on Earth the alien murders a doctor named Harry and transforms to appear like the human, watching “Law &amp; Order” reruns to learn to speak English.</p>
<p>Harry lives remotely for four months until a local doctor dies and Harry is summoned by the town sheriff (Corey Reynolds) to perform an autopsy.</p>
<p>The humor stems from Harry’s fish-out-of-water, uncomfortable-in-his-own-skin circumstances brought to smart, funny life by Tudyk. “Resident Alien” is a show to keep an eye on.</p>
<p><strong>NBCU’s future plans</strong></p>
<p>NBC renewed Amy Poehler’s “Making It” for a third season and Ellen DeGeneres’ “Ellen’s Greatest Night of Giveaways” for a second.</p>
<p>Poehler and Tina Fey will return to host the “Golden Globes” in 2021.</p>
<p>NBC renewed “New Amsterdam” for three more seasons, keeping it on the air through at least the 2022-23 season. NBC’s Kenan Thompson sitcom, originally intended for the 2019-20 TV season, will push to 2020-21.</p>
<p>“Fresh Off the Boat” creator Nahnatchka Khan will co-write “Young Rock,” a comedy about the early life of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson for NBC. Johnson will appear in every episode, but the focus will be on the star in his formative years.</p>
<p>Jimmy Fallon will host prime-time comedy-variety series “That’s My Jam,” airing after the Tokyo Summer Olympics this summer.</p>
<p>Planning even further ahead, NBC will make a nature docu-series, a la BBC America’s “Planet Earth,” called “The New World,” which will debut after the 2024 Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>NBCUniversal’s Syfy ordered a series based on the “Chucky” feature films about a killer doll.</p>
<p>Syfy is also developing a “Peter Pan” sequel limited series, “The League of Pan,” set 10 years after the characters moved to the mainland with a grown up Wendy Darling estranged from The Lost Boys. They must team up and return to Neverland to face a new evil.</p>
