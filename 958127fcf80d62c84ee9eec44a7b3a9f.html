<h1>Federal judge rules closures ordered by Wolf, Levine unconstitutional. They "crossed those lines."</h1>

<p>A federal judge in Pittsburgh ruled Monday that the non-life-sustaining business closures, restrictions on outdoor gatherings and stay-at-home orders undertaken by Gov. Tom Wolf and Secretary of Health Rachel Levine to mitigate COVID-19 were unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Liberties guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution cannot be subordinated even during times of an emergency, United States District Judge William S. Stickman IV wrote in his opinion, and the Constitution cannot accept the concept of a "new normal."</p>
<p>"The liberties protected by the Constitution are not fair-weather freedoms — in place when times are good but able to be cast aside in times of trouble. There is no question that this Country has faced, and will face, emergencies of every sort," Judge Stickman wrote. "But the solution to a national crisis can never be permitted to supersede the commitment to individual liberty that stands as the foundation of the American experiment."</p>
<p>Rather, Judge Stickman wrote, "the Constitution sets certain lines that may not be crossed, even in an emergency," and actions taken by Mr. Wolf and Dr. Levine "crossed those lines" and are unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Specifically, their outdoor gathering limits violated the First Amendment's right of assembly, their stay-at-home orders and components of the business closure orders violated due process of the 14th Amendment and their business closure components violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, the court ruled.</p>
<p>Butler, Fayette, Green and Washington counties — representing business and political entities who were impacted by the state's restrictions — had sued Mr. Wolf and Dr. Levine, alleging, among other things, that the state's business closure orders were "arbitrary, capricious and interfered with the concept of 'ordered liberty' as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment."</p>
<p>Though the court acknowledged Mr. Wolf and Dr. Levine "undertook their actions in a well-intentioned effort to protect Pennsylvanians from the virus," Judge Stickman wrote that "good intentions toward a laudable end are not alone enough to uphold governmental action against a constitutional challenge."</p>
<p>Once relinquished, Constitutional liberties, the judge wrote, are hard to recoup and restrictions, while expedient during emergency, may persist long after danger has passed.</p>
<p>And the threat to constitutional liberties is still ongoing, the judge noted.</p>
<p>"The language of the [business closure and stay-at-home provisions of the orders] themselves, as well as testimony adduced at trial, show that these provisions are merely suspended, not rescinded, and can be re-imposed at [Mr. Wolf and Dr. Levine's] will," the judge wrote.</p>
