<h1>Watt brothers nail questions about each other on Jimmy Fallon's 'Tonight Show'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Watt brothers are pretty good at football, and at keeping their stories straight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trio of the Houston Texans’ J.J. and the Steelers’ Derek and T.J. effortlessly guessed each other’s answers while playing a game called&nbsp;“Know Your Bro” during a combined video chat interview Tuesday on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”</p>

<p>The rules of the game were pretty simple. Fallon asked two of the brothers a question about the third while he was unable to hear their answer. Fallon then posed the same question to the third brother, and if he produced the same answer, points were awarded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brothers ended up on the same page for all three questions, which evoked some pretty amusing family history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>J.J. and Derek were first asked about a sticky situation they’d bailed their youngest brother, T.J., out of. Their answer was an allergic reaction during a trip to Italy, which T.J. guessed easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>J.J. and T.J. then explained that they were most jealous of Derek when he was named the homecoming theme — yes, theme — back in high school. Derek knew instantly that it was one of J.J.’s favorite stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for the last question about a time J.J. failed as a babysitter for his two younger brothers, Derek and T.J. recalled a cooking catastrophe known simply as&nbsp;“the chicken story,” one J.J. remembered vividly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not bad for some socially distanced entertainment to break up an offseason that’s seen Derek join T.J. in Pittsburgh after signing a three-year free agent deal with the Steelers last month.&nbsp;</p>
