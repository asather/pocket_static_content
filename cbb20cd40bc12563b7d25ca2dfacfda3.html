<h1>Increasing liability: Poorly maintained trees continue to cost the city</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Controller Michael Lamb’s recent performance audit of the city’s law department should remind residents of the city’s failure to remedy its ongoing problem with poorly maintained trees.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lamb’s report, Pittsburgh continues to pay out tens of thousands of dollars for claims related to damage caused by city-maintained trees. In fact, the majority of claims made against the city in both 2016 and 2017 related to incidents involving city-maintained trees.</p>
<p>The risk posed by Pittsburgh’s poorly kept trees is well-known. Each year, the city is forced to pay damages when trees fall on cars, or tree roots damage sidewalks, utility lines and buildings. It seems fortunate that people have not been injured or even killed, though the risk of such a tragedy increases with each day.</p>
<p>The city each year receives millions of dollars from the Allegheny Regional Asset District to be used for city assets and amenities. Add to that the recently passed 0.5-mill property tax levy that is expected to generate approximately $10 million per year for Pittsburgh’s public parks.</p>
<p>Yet somehow, with all this money, the city has been either unable or unwilling to address its trees, which are an increasing liability to both the city’s coffers and public safety. That Mayor Bill Peduto has been unable to handle basic maintenance of Pittsburgh’s arboricultural assets with the funds already on hand is ridiculous. That he supported a tax, asking for more money to support city parks without first addressing issues with city trees, is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb’s audit should remind Mr. Peduto and City Council of this issue, which has been overlooked for too long. A concrete action plan must be formed to assess and tend to the city’s trees, ensuring that lives and property are better protected before more cars or houses are damaged or, worse, someone is killed.</p>
