<h1>Biden, in pitch for unity, nearly derailed by demonstrators at Detroit rally</h1>

<p>DETROIT — Former Vice President Joe Biden made his pitch for unity ahead of Michigan’s presidential primary on Tuesday, but his effort was nearly derailed by demonstrators who infiltrated his final public push before a critical day on the primary calendar.</p>
<p>“I refuse to accept the notion that we’re in a perpetual state of war with the other party,” Mr. Biden told a crowd of a few hundred Monday night at a high school gymnasium after the outburst, speaking in general about the nation under President Donald Trump. “We can’t become like them. We have to heal our divisions.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s final appeal to Michigan Democrats — which featured fiery addresses from Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, former 2020 rivals who are now surrogates for Mr. Biden — comes at a pivotal time in the Democratic primary, when a decisive win in Michigan could solidify the leading status of either candidate in the two-man race.</p>
<p>But it was unsettled by at least two dozen protesters who interrupted Mr. Biden for nearly 10 minutes and waved signs in support of the Green New Deal and against the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Biden voted for as a senator. The former vice president struggled afterward to reclaim the energy in the room after taking the stage 90 minutes behind the scheduled start time.</p>
<p>“It’s not a Trump rally. It’s OK. Let him go,” Mr. Biden said as officers surrounded a group of demonstrators. They were all eventually escorted out of the gymnasium.</p>
<p>Preceding Mr. Biden on stage were Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris, two candidates of color who competed in a historically large and diverse Democratic primary field that’s now down to two white men in their late 70s.</p>
<p>“We will not be overlooked and we will not be canceled ... that’s what this election is about. It’s about saying we know we matter we know the power is with the people,” Ms. Harris told the crowd in a majority African-American city.</p>
<p>The primary is unfolding amid major domestic and international upheaval over a plunging stock market and the spreading coronavirus, which has reached Ohio but not Michigan. Attendees were offered hand sanitizer on their way inside.</p>
<p>Michigan is the biggest prize of the six states voting Tuesday, with 125 delegates up for grabs. After losses in Super Tuesday states he expected to win, Michigan’s primary is a make-or-break moment for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who in 2016 won Michigan in the biggest upset of the primary cycle.</p>
<p>At the same time, a Biden victory in Michigan, a battleground in the general election, could seal up the nomination and bolster the argument that Mr. Biden is the better candidate to defeat Mr. Trump in November.</p>
<p>Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, an early Biden endorser, praised the Obama-Biden administration for the auto industry bailout, a lifeline credited to the prior administration that’s still fresh in the minds of many voters. The auto bailout was referenced by every local speaker.</p>
<p>“In 2009, when GM and Chrysler were on the verge of bankruptcy ... it was Barack Obama and Joe Biden who went in and fought for us,” Mr. Duggan said.</p>
<p>“When we were on the ropes, when our auto industry was struggling, who had our backs? Barack Obama and Joe Biden” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said. “They came to our rescue when people counted us out, when they said let it fail.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s Monday evening appearance marked the end of a pre-primary campaign swing in Michigan, where he made stops in Grand Rapids and Flint. He also held a private fund-raiser in Detroit before the rally.</p>
<p>The event at Renaissance High School in northwest Detroit drew a diverse crowd, including a number of college and high school students, and new Biden supporters wearing the garb of their favorite former candidates.</p>
<p>“It came in the mail today,” said Drake Heidepriem, a 21-year-old in a Pete Buttigieg shirt. “I still want Pete to be president, but Biden is the closest thing left. My Biden shirt is on the way.”</p>
<p>He said it’s a misconception that Mr. Sanders, who underperformed among his younger base on Super Tuesday, is the candidate who appeals most to his peers.</p>
<p>“It’s not true,” he said. “People make you choose. If you’re not a democratic socialist, you’re a Republican, which I don’t think is fair.”</p>
<p>As much as they want a candidate who embodies progressive ideals, first-time and young voters said it was more important to nominate someone who can beat Mr. Trump and unify the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>“I can see Republicans get nervous when they talk about him,” Liam Richichi, a 17-year-old from Northville, Mich.</p>
<p>While Mr. Biden deployed surrogates including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar to campaign here before his arrival, Mr. Sanders canceled events in other states to spend more time in Michigan. The Vermont senator began stumping here Friday, courting the large Muslim and Arab-American population in Dearborn and drawing 10,000 to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor over the weekend.</p>
<p>Polling released Monday shows Mr. Biden with a wide lead over Mr. Sanders. The Monmouth University survey has Mr. Biden ahead of Mr. Sanders, 51 percent to 36 percent. But Monmouth noted Michigan polls before the 2016 primary were off by a large margin, showing Mrs. Clinton with a double-digit lead in a state Mr. Sanders won by a narrow margin.</p>
<p>The next stop for both candidates is Ohio, whose primary is next week. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are holding dueling rallies Tuesday night in Cleveland as Michigan announces its results.</p>
