<h1>Pittsburgh cancels St. Patrick's Day parade; G-7 ministerial to be held virtually</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The City of Pittsburgh on Wednesday canceled the St. Patrick’s Day parade, citing concerns over the&nbsp;“rapid spread of COVID-19 virus.” Additionally, the upcoming&nbsp;G-7 ministerial meeting will now be held virtually by video teleconference instead of in the city, according to a spokeswoman with the U.S. Department of State.</p>
<p>The parade, which was scheduled for Saturday, is yet another holiday parade being eliminated due to the coronavirus outbreak. Pittsburgh joins Boston, Chicaco, Dublin, Ireland, Philadelphia and San Francisco among cities that have canceled their festivities.</p>
<p>“The health of our residents and visitors to our city must be our main priority,” said Mayor Bill Peduto in a statement. “This mitigation measure will help keep people in Pittsburgh and Western Pa. safe.”</p>
<p>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said it was a "very hard decision" to cancel the parade, but it's the right thing to do. The idea is to "slow the virus down."</p>
<p>The G-7 meeting, which was scheduled to take place at the Omni William Penn hotel March 24 and 25, comes ahead of the G-7 summit at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland. President Donald Trump originally planned to hold the summit, which is scheduled for June, at his his Doral golf resort in Miami.</p>
<p>The G-7 ministerial face-to-face meeting will now be held virtually “out of an abundance of caution.”</p>
<p>“We thank the city of Pittsburgh for its willingness to host this year's G-7 ministerial and for the support and assistance planning this year's event,” said U.S. Dept. of State spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus in a statement. “We look forward to holding future events there.”</p>
<p>The city said it is following recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/10/pittsburgh-pennsylvania-quarantine-self-isolation/stories/202003100088" target="_blank">to avoid mass gatherings and observe social distancing.</a></p>
<p>The city said it informed parade organizers about the cancellation this morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 in Allegheny County, but 14 cases have been reported statewide, according to the Pennsylvania Health Department.</p>
<p>The next 4 to 8 weeks will be "challenging," Mr. Hissrich said. "It's a matter of when the virus hits Allegheny."</p>
<p>Prior to the city’s notice of the parade cancellation, several people took to Twitter calling for postponement.&nbsp;Suzy Silliman, of Fox Chapel, said “it’s&nbsp;not disrespectful to the holiday when the Irish government canceled their celebrations.”</p>
<p>“Personally, I have changed much of my personal interactions,” Ms. Silliman said.&nbsp;“[I’ve] stopped going to yoga, the gym, and activities where it’s an elective and I am in close proximity to people I don’t know.&nbsp; .... It may be an inconvenience and uncomfortable for a couple of weeks or months to take certain precautions, but the risk is far worse.”</p>
<p>City Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle, whose District 6 includes the parade route, said he hasn’t heard from his constituents concerning COVID-19 and the parade being canceled.</p>
<p>“I believe it was the appropriate action to take, for the city to be as proactive as possible as it relates to the spread of the coronavirus and limiting people’s exposure to it,” he said.</p>
<p>Other preventative steps the city is taking include cancelling business travel for all city employees, particularly those traveling by air. Also, city meetings in which 50 or more people are expected to attend will be canceled until further notice.</p>
<p>Dan Gilman, the mayor’s chief of staff, said the city is working with its Law Department about what legal authority it has to mandate cancellations of public events, such as sporting events, "if the need arises to take those steps."</p>
