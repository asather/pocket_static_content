<h1>Ruth Ann Dailey: RBG and politics </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>No matter which side you’re on, you have to admit we will likely never see a more perfect (or more bitter) case of “The shoe’s on the other foot” than the current Supreme Court set-to.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans who refused to consider President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court eight months before the 2016 election are now promising that President Donald Trump’s nominee will have a hearing and a vote with mere weeks to go before the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the Democrats who insist we wait till after the election to fill the vacant seat are the ones who pushed for Judge Garland’s consideration in 2016.</p>
<p>Back then, one observer said, “There’s nothing in the Constitution that says the president stops being president in his last year.”</p>
<p>That observer was Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death Sept. 18 has dramatically transformed the 2020 presidential campaign. It is worth adding to Justice Ginsburg’s observation the fact that the Senate likewise does not stop being the Senate in an election year.</p>
<p>The Constitution assigns each of those two branches — executive and legislative — a role to play in staffing the third — the judiciary. Which of the two prevails, if they are in conflict, is a matter of politics, pure and simple.</p>
<p>Or impure, increasingly simplistic and savage. That’s the discouraging trend.</p>
<p>Scholars say the court was a fraught institution from the get-go, with nasty turbulence resurfacing in the post-Civil War era. If that is some consolation, it’s also ancient history. As we scan the modern era, the back and forth of partisanship amid larger historical forces is easier to recall.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick summary:</p>
<p>After the scandal of Franklin Roosevelt’s court-packing gambit to protect his New Deal agenda, and after the horrors of World War II, the country settled into an exhausted bipartisan cooperation.</p>
<p>Harry Truman appointed four justices. Dwight Eisenhower appointed five, including Earl Warren, Potter Stewart and William Brennan (who served until 1990!).</p>
<p>As late as 1965, a justice could be confirmed to the court by “acclamation” — that is, without a roll call — because bipartisan support was usually overwhelming.</p>
<p>Can you imagine that happening today? Actually, it could have with Justice Ginsburg. As President Bill Clinton’s first nominee, she was confirmed in 1993 by a vote of 96-3.</p>
<p>Similarly, Anthony Kennedy was confirmed 97-0 in 1987, Antonin Scalia (the first Italian American justice) was confirmed 98-0 in 1986, and Sandra Day O’Connor (the first female justice) was confirmed in 1981, 99-0.</p>
<p>Those are modern high points. The low points — incontrovertibly — have all targeted Republican nominations. Robert Bork, Douglas Ginsburg, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have all been savaged. No Democratic nominee has yet been subjected to such character assassination.</p>
<p>And in keeping with that pattern, more Republican senators have voted for Democratic nominees than vice versa, ever since the Reagan era. That’s when the big shift occurred.</p>
<p>Media figures and other nonelected partisans may blow their hot air, wag their heads and express grave concerns, but what really matters is what the senators say and how they vote.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine any event that could alter this downward trajectory, but beyond the ugly politics of Supreme Court appointments, the ugliness that prevails everywhere these days has created an urgent need.</p>
<p>We face an election likely to be disputed in ways that make the hanging chads of 2000 and Russian meddling of 2016 look minor league. We should brace for lawsuits, recounts and bitter recriminations.</p>
<p>Our republic has a better chance of surviving the looming debacle if we have nine justices on the nation’s highest court. American voters, knowing Supreme Court nominations were at stake, expanded the Republicans’ Senate majority in 2018. The Senate should proceed to advise and consent. That’s politics.</p>
<p>If doing so stirs up Democratic voters and hurts Republicans’ chances in 2020 and beyond, well, that’s politics, too. It’s not for the spineless.</p>
