<h1>Gov. Wolf vows to veto bill loosening rules for conventional oil and gas wells</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A proposal to ease environmental regulations for the state’s struggling conventional oil and gas industry advanced in the state House on Monday, despite a vow from Gov. Tom Wolf to veto it in its current form.</p>
<p>The bill aims to give Pennsylvania’s traditional oil and gas drillers a distinct set of rules, since their smaller, shallower operations have been both overshadowed and squeezed by the rise of Marcellus and Utica shale drilling.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?syear=2019&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=790" target="_blank">Senate Bill 790</a> was unanimously amended by the House environmental resources committee to strip out the most contentious provision, which would have allowed untreated brine from wells to be <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2018/06/14/PSU-study-pans-roadway-brine-drilling-wastewater/stories/201806130183" target="_blank">spread on dirt roads</a> to keep dust down. The amendment also lowered the threshold for when spills have to be reported to regulators.</p>
<p>Still, the Wolf administration said it cannot support the bill as it is drafted because it weakens protections for drinking water supplies, allows more spills to go unreported and skirts erosion permitting requirements.</p>
<p>The bill exempts spills as large as 200 gallons of brine and 80 gallons of oil from having to be reported to regulators. The current spill-reporting standard is 5 gallons.</p>
<p>Rep. Martin Causer, R-Cameron, one of the bill’s key advocates, called the proposed law a necessary compromise.</p>
<p>“We need a separate statute for conventional operations versus unconventional, because they are very different operations,” he said. The bill “would provide for reasonable, responsible regulation of the conventional industry.”</p>
<p>Facing sustained low oil and gas prices and dwindling options for cost-effectively dealing with their wastewater, many conventional oil and gas companies are struggling to survive.</p>
<p>There were 172 conventional wells drilled in Pennsylvania in 2019, according to DEP records. A decade before, more than 2,000 conventional wells were drilled in a year.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf’s spokesman J.J. Abbott said during the past two legislative sessions, the administration has worked “to find common ground on numerous technical issues and policy concerns in order to tailor regulatory requirements appropriate to the conventional oil and gas industry.”</p>
<p>But the bill continues to contain provisions that “undermine core environmental protection principles,” he said, and it “poses an undeniable risk to the health and safety of our citizens, the environment, and our public resources.”</p>
<p>Members of both parties agreed that more has to be done to plug the estimated 200,000 <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2017/11/28/New-estimates-abandoned-wells-less-dire-still-daunting-Pennsylvania-Engelder/stories/201711280008" target="_blank">abandoned, ownerless wells</a> in Pennsylvania and that the conventional industry has the tools and expertise to perform that work.</p>
<p>Mr. Causer said the bill “sets up a framework to attack the issue,” by offering grants and other financial incentives to companies that voluntarily plug abandoned wells.</p>
<p>The committee voted to advance the bill to the full House with a largely party line vote, with Democratic Rep. Pam Snyder of Greene County joining Republicans in support.</p>
<p>An earlier version of the bill passed the Senate with a vote of 26-23 in October.</p>
