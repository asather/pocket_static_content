<h1>Paul Zeise mailbag: Why weren't people as outraged by the Patriots scandal as they are the Astros?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat Steelers with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @PaulZeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Zach:</strong>&nbsp;Why is it that seemingly so many more people are angry at what the Astros did than the Patriots? New England cheated for a longer period of time and won more championships than Houston, but I don't recall the outrage being this high when "Spygate" came out.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I don’t know that is completely true. I think it is clear that the other players, the other teams and the league seem to be more angry at the Astros than the NFL and company were at the Patriots. But that seems to be more about the culture of baseball versus football. The same could be said about how both leagues have felt about and dealt with steroids. I think most fans and most observers were equally as disgusted with the Patriots as they are the Astros. Both teams are cheaters. I will say this — the Patriots’ fans are far more cult like and delusional in their defense of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. The Astros fans aren’t nearly as quick to blindly defend their team, so that is a part of what you are seeing as well.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;Since the Steelers have cap issues and won't sign a back-up QB in free-agency, do you think they might give some XFLers a shot? I believe P.J. Walker could be Tommy Maddox 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Well maybe they should go sign the fifth-leading passer in the XFL, Landry Jones. I get your sentiment, but I don’t know that I see a single quarterback in that league that is better than Mason Rudolph. I mean, Josh Johnson and Cardale Jones have both been in the NFL before. I don’t think there is anything there to get excited about. That’s a big problem if you ask me. The Steelers have said they will go with Rudolph and Ben Roethlisberger, and I don’t see them moving away from that plan unless Roethlisberger isn’t capable of playing.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> What are your thoughts about the fact that the Brewers just signed a player for $200 million? Why can’t the Pirates do something like this? The Reds now have a payroll that is $80 million more than the Pirates and that is embarrassing for Bob Nutting.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> It makes Bob Nutting and all of his excuses seem silly. Nobody expects the Pirates to go out and spend $150 million on their payroll. But they can certainly do better than they are doing right now. And there is no reason they can’t go out and sign a player like a Christian Yelich from time to time. The Pirates are clearly the fifth team in the division now and won’t get out of the basement unless Nutting is wiling to spend more money.</p>
<p><strong>Charles:</strong> I am just thinking outside the box but why couldn't Sully (Mike Sullivan) continue this goalie rotation into the playoffs? Its never been done before — I know, but neither was putting a man on the moon!</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I don’t know why you would need to. You start with one. If he plays well, you ride him until he doesn’t. The playoffs are about momentum and goalies like to settle in to a rhythm. It would make no sense to alternate between one and the other. Matt Murray has proven he can win the Stanley Cup. He should get the first shot at being the goalie. If he falters, you can always switch to Tristan Jarry. But if Murray gets on a roll, you stick with him knowing full well he gives you a good insurance policy. That’s the ideal situation.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck:</strong> Why don’t teams employ one running quarterback, and one pocket passer? It would force opponents to have two threats to prepare for. Is it because of salaries?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I think it is similar to the answer above — quarterbacks like to get into a rhythm. Salary is also a consideration as it would be tough to pay two quarterbacks. The larger point: I don’t know that the passing quarterback would want to give up plays to the running quarterback, and vice versa. And you would become pretty predictable. Quarterbacks like to get into the flow of a game and like the sequence of play calling that comes along with running an entire game.</p>
<p><strong>Ian:&nbsp;</strong>Are some people putting too much faith in Jeff Capel to turn things around at Pitt? His final 2 years as Head Coach of Oklahoma before he was fired were bad.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Yes, there were some circumstances that led to the bottom falling out at Oklahoma, though. And I think that he has matured and learned a lot from his time working under Coach K after that. He is a very good recruiter and he is bringing in good players. He seems to communicate well with his players. He has energized the fan base. It just takes time. There is a lot that has to happen to rebuild a program. He has a long way to go, but he has made some reasonably good strides in a short time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phil:</strong> Do you think there is enough acknowledgement of Pittsburgh’s history with regards to the Negro Leagues? It doesn’t seem like a lot people know the history.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I would agree with that to a point. Pittsburgh does have a very proud tradition of excellent Negro League baseball teams. The Homestead Grays. The Pittsburgh Crawfords. These were two of the best franchises and featured some of the game’s greatest players. Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, Buck Leonard, Smokey Joe Williams. There are 12 Grays in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. That’s impressive. I will say this — the Pirates have done a very good job of keeping these legacies alive. The Pirates have had throwback uniform days, bobblehead days and a number of other ways to keep this history alive.&nbsp;</p>
