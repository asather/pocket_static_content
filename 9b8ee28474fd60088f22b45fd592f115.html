<h1>Lake Erie walleye, perch limits remain unchanged</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last week, the state Fish and Boat Commission said Lake Erie walleye and yellow perch populations are at maintenance levels, and creel limits will hold steady in 2020. Anglers on those waters may harvest six walleye and 30 perch per day.</p>
<p>The perch catch has been hit and miss for at least two years. In March, a committee of biologists from states and provinces surrounding Lake Erie decreased the allowable commercial perch harvest by 8%.</p>
<p>“Based on large year classes in 2015, 2018 and 2019, walleye fishing on Lake Erie should remain very good for several years,” said Chuck Murray, Fish and Boat’s Lake Erie biologist.</p>
<p>Walleye abundance has more than doubled since 2019;&nbsp;the 2020 population is estimated to exceed 100 million fish age 2 and older. Mr. Murray said 75% of the ’eyes expected to be caught this year will be from the large 2018 year class, and a significant number will likely be throwaways under the 15-inch limit.</p>
<p>In Lake Erie and inland waters, the walleye season runs May 2-Dec. 31. Pennsylvania’s Lake Erie perch season extends from May 1 to Nov. 3 with no minimum size. In inland waters there’s an open season on perch, no size minimum and a daily limit of 50 combined species including yellow and white perch, sunfish, crappies, catfish, rock bass, suckers, carp, white bass, bowfin and other gamefish not otherwise listed.</p>
<p><strong>Turkey seasons set</strong></p>
<p>The state Game Commission will split the difference between hunter access to wild turkeys and species management during the 2020-21 seasons.</p>
<p>At the April 6-7 meeting of the state Game Commission, members brought back the three-day Thanksgiving turkey season in some wildlife management units and extended the regular fall season from one to two weeks in others.</p>
<p>Mary Jo Caselana, the agency’s turkey biologist, said those changes combined with decreased season length in WMUs with higher hunter pressure provides balance that the birds need to remain healthy.</p>
<p>“It looks like an increase in hunting opportunities, but it’s really just population control,” she said.</p>
<p>With the spring hunt focused exclusively on toms and timed to prevent disruption of hens on nests, the turkey population is manipulated by WMU-based fluctuations of the autumn hunts for roosters and hens, she said.</p>
<p>In WMU 2A in the state’s southwestern corner, the 2020 fall hunt is scheduled for Oct. 31-Nov. 14 with no Thanksgiving season. In shotgun and archery-only 2B surrounding Pittsburgh, and in 2C extending from western Westmoreland to western Bedford counties, the split season will run Oct. 31-Nov. 14 with no Thanksgiving season.</p>
<p>The 2021 spring gobbler season will continue to restrict hunting hours to mornings only during the first two weeks, when hens are more likely to abandon nests if disturbed. The hunt will run May 1-31.</p>
<p>“Hunters don’t like that we start the [spring] season so late. They want to hunt when the birds are gobbling,” said Ms. Caselana. “But turkeys are one of the only species we hunt during breeding season. The good thing about Pennsylvania is that our [spring] season is timed to open biologically properly. The gobblers have bred the hens and the hens are already incubating eggs. They’re less likely to be flushed off the nest. If they are, they probably come back, and there’s less hen mortality and more eggs likely to hatch.”</p>
