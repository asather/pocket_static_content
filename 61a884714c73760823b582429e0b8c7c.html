But if the necessary four justices agree to hear the case and expedite it for this term, it would mean that the justices would render a decision concerning the fate of the controversial law this spring, just as the presidential election gears up.</p><p>And although the Trump administration believes the entire law should ultimately be invalidated, it may not look forward to such a decision impacting millions of Americans coming down before the election.</p><p>In 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts cast the key vote in the 5-4 decision upholding the Affordable Care Act’s holding that the individual mandate was valid under Congress’ taxing power. But in 2017, the Republican-led Congress cut the tax penalty for those who lacked insurance to zero as part of the year-end tax overhaul.</p><p>“Although the ACA has continued to be the subject of policy debate, this Court has definitively held that the Act’s health insurance reforms are constitutional,” the House filing Friday states.</p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/01/04/House-Democratic-led-states-ask-court-to-immediately-decide-Obamacare-fate/stories/202001050108</original_url>
