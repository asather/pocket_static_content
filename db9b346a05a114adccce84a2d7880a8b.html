<h1>Hundreds march to Pittsburgh mayor’s house as anger lingers over plainclothes arrest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto’s house on Tuesday evening in response to a Black Lives Matter demonstrator being arrested at a protest Saturday by plainclothes police officers.</p>
<p>Protesters started marching in East Liberty, eventually making their way to Mr. Peduto’s home in Point Breeze.</p>
<p>Protesters also gathered in front of the mayor’s home Sunday to object to the “low-visibility arrest” of Matthew Cartier at a protest in Oakland the previous night.</p>
<p>Police say that Mr. Cartier was blocking an intersection, then was arrested and taken away in an unmarked vehicle after multiple warnings to stop. He was charged with two misdemeanors, including disorderly conduct.</p>
<p>After gathering in front of the mayor’s home Tuesday, protesters said that they will not leave until the mayor addresses them, with one protester even appearing to bring an air mattress.</p>
<p>The protest has thus far remained peaceful.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mr. Peduto decried the methods police used to make the arrest.</p>
<p>"It is hard to find the words for how livid I was after seeing the online videos of the disturbing arrest at Saturday's protest," Mr. Peduto said in a statement Monday. "I have taken the time to review all the video and information that has been made available to me. As mayor, I will never tolerate these tactics being used at peaceful protests again."</p>
