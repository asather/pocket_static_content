<h1>Buying Here: Turned around Crafton house is priced at $159,900</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jeffrey and Sarah Taylor came to Pittsburgh for work. When they decided to purchase a home, Crafton was an easy choice.</p>
<p>“We loved being close to the airport and friends,” she said. “The day we moved in, everyone came to say ‘Hi.’ There was a real sense of community.”</p>
<p>They chose <strong>15 Harrison St.</strong>, a three-bedroom, 1½-bath frame house built in 1878. Now, after 2½ years, they are moving again and have put the house on the market for $159,900 (MLS No. 1431950) with Lu Ryan of Howard Hanna Real Estate Services (412-708-2300 or <a href="https://www.howardhanna.com/Property/Detail/15-HARRISON-STREET-Crafton-PA-15205/Westpenn/1431950" target="_blank">www.howardhanna.com</a>). The house is under agreement.</p>
<p>The previous owner, a carpenter, lived in the home for more than 50 years,&nbsp;Ms. Taylor said. It was originally one of several houses built on a back lot of a house on Johnston Street. Homeowners successfully petitioned the borough to make Harrison a street. After the change, the owner made the back of the house the front.</p>
<p>The exterior is covered in vinyl siding and the front porch, the former back porch, has lots of gingerbread trim.</p>
<p>Inside, the entry features crown molding and trime that was reclaimed from an old area steel mill. The wood floors are parquet.</p>
<p>“There was not much to do there,” Ms. Taylor said. “The neighbors helped us spackle and repaint several rooms.”</p>
<p>When the couple realized the fireplace in the 13-by-15-foot living room had been covered up, they decided to restore it. They found an old mantel on Craigslist and restored it.</p>
<p>“It was covered by four coats of paint,” she said. “We removed the paint and scraped the dirt off of the mirror and saw it was dated 1838.”</p>
<p>The 12-by-15-foot dining room is located in the former entry, The original carved entry door gives access to the back porch, which is screened..</p>
<p>The 12-by-6-foot kitchen was updated by the previous owners with wood cabinets, solid surface counter tops and white appliances, including a gas range.</p>
<p>The largest of the three bedrooms is the 13-by-16-foot master. Painted a deep navy blue with crisp white trim, it has natural pine floors and a ceiling fan. An 11-by-15-foot bedroom and full bathroom are also on the second floor.</p>
<p>The third bedroom on the third floor measures 12 by 15 feet and has a powder room that could be turned into a full bathroom. The floor is natural pine and dormers add visual interest to the beamed ceiling.</p>
<p>There are two off-street parking spaces and a level, fenced-in backyard. The walk-out basement contains the laundry and a bathroom with a shower.</p>
<p>“We installed new windows on the first floor,” Ms. Taylor said. “We use window air-conditioners.”</p>
<p>The property’s assessed value is $113,100. Over the last four years, five houses have sold on Harrison Street, including this one, for prices ranging from $100,000 in October 2018 to $165,000 in July 2016 (<a href="http://www2.county.allegheny.pa.us/RealEstate/Sales.aspx" target="_blank">www2.county.allegheny.pa.us/RealEstate/Sales.aspx</a>). The home is in the Carlynton School District.</p>
<p>“It was hard to leave our neighbors,” Ms. Taylor said. “The community was such a nice surprise for us. We hope the new owners will love it as much we did.”</p>
