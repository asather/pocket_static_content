<h1>Lawyers for transgender women argue against Pa. law barring name changes for felons</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A panel of state Commonwealth Court judges heard arguments Thursday in a case challenging a state law that bars some convicted felons from legally changing their names, even if those convicted felons are transgender and hope to change their names to reflect their gender identity.</p>
<p>Lawyers for three transgender women suing the commonwealth’s Department of State focused on the portion of the law barring felons from going to court to prove that their name change is not intended for fraud, which the law was intended to prevent. They asked the court, meeting in the&nbsp;Teplitz Memorial Courtroom at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, to declare that piece of the law unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The 1998 law requires that all applicants who wish to undergo a name change follow a certain procedure, including providing police with fingerprints and a name change petition. Additionally, the law bars anybody convicted of serious felonies such as murder and rape from ever seeking a name change.</p>
<p>Patrick Yingling, the lawyer who argued on behalf of the women, said it was unfair to presume every convicted felon was looking to change their name for a fraudulent purpose, and said everyone should enjoy the same name-change process, including convicted felons.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the commonwealth said that allowing felony convicts to change their names may affect employers who try to run background checks and come up with incomplete results, in addition to other kinds of fraud.</p>
<p>Alex Korn, a lawyer for the state, said that there are many consequences that result from a felony conviction, including losing the right to own a gun or serve on a jury. The inability to change one’s name, he said, is another consequence.</p>
<p>The petitioners, who were not present at court, are Allegheny County residents Chauntey Mo’Nique Porter (born Scott Porter) and Priscylla Renee Von Noaker (Robert Lee Noaker Jr.), and Philadelphia resident Alonda Talley (Adolphus Talley Jr.).</p>
<p>Judges Bonnie Brigance Leadbetter, Michael H. Wojcik and Patricia A. McCollough focused on whether the right party had been sued by Mr. Yingling and his team. The Department of State, they said, “supervises and administers” the law, it does not enforce it.</p>
<p>The judges did not issue a ruling.</p>
<p>Noah Lewis, another lawyer for the women, said after the hearing that the law forces transgender people to use a name that doesn’t match who they are, creating economic and employment barriers and increasing risk for harassment and violence.</p>
<p>“Having a name that doesn’t match [who someone presents as] means being forced to publicize one’s transgender status to everyone from the clerk at the grocery store to a room full of patients in a doctor’s office waiting room,” said Mr. Lewis.</p>
