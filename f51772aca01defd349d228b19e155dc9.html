<h1>Pet Tales: Nation's No. 1 cat will be at local Steel City Kitties show</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>So many pretty kitties will be at the Steel City Kitties cat shows on Feb. 8 and 9, including Crioula, a calico Persian currently ranked No. 1 in competitions sponsored by Cat Fanciers Association, Inc.</p>
<p>Bred and born in Brazil, Crioula has lived in Washington, D.C., for the past 20 months with Michael Piziali&nbsp;and Ritch&nbsp;Tindall and their three retired Persian show cats, Amore, Dolce and Winter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crioula is coming here because&nbsp;“it’s a well-run show with top cats from around the country,” Mr. Tindall said in a telephone interview.&nbsp;“There’s a good judging lineup and a good gate,” by which he means a lot of spectators at the annual Steel City Kitties shows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year the show has moved to Beaver County. The venue is The Willows Event Center, 1830 Beaver Road, Industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Persians are arguably the purebred cat most likely to be recognized by the cat-loving public. Persians have long, full coats, big expressive eyes and are&nbsp;“one of the oldest pedigreed cat breeds,” according to the CFA website.</p>
<p>Underneath that lovely coat, Ghattas Crioula of Paradiso weighs just under 10 pounds. Getting her ready for the show ring takes two or three hours of bathing and blow-drying. At home, she is brushed every day to keep her coat in top condition and to prevent matts.</p>
<p>That’s why you can admire Crioula, but you can’t touch her. The natural oils on our fingers — or even dirt —&nbsp;could undo some of that grooming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be at least one&nbsp;“pet me” cat at the show. That’s&nbsp;Kramd’n Coon Supurr Coopurr, a 5-year-old Maine coon, who will be there with show chairman Alice Schepp of South Fayette. Coopurr, an eye-catching 24 pounds, is retired from shows and now is a full-time pet who makes therapy visits to nursing homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marilyn McBane of Avalon, co-chair of the show, may also bring along a Maine coon that is available for petting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crioula&nbsp;“is a typical Persian diva” who enjoys competing on the cat show circuit, said Mr. Piziali, an attorney. In the past year they’ve gone to shows nearly every weekend to keep her in the No. 1 spot.</p>
<p>Showing cats is an expensive hobby, not a money-making venture, especially for&nbsp;Crioula. She’s spayed, so there will be no kittens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Piziali and Mr. Tindall have been showing cats since 1994, but they have not done any breeding since 1998.&nbsp;CFA allows spayed females and neutered males to compete for ribbons and titles.</p>
<p>In the show ring Crioula is more animated than most Persians. “The long-haired cats generally pose. The short-haired cats are more playful, but Crioula will climb the pole,” said Mr. Piziali.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They call it a&nbsp;“show ring,” but unlike show dogs, cats are not leashed and trotted around the ring.</p>
<p>The cat show rings are tables where judges examine cats. There’s a pole on the table. Some cats will stand on their hind legs to stretch up along the pole and use their front claws like they would on a scratching post. Spectators really like it when cats do that.</p>
<p>At cat shows, unlike dog shows,&nbsp; judges will explain what they like about the cat they are examining and will often give histories of breeds that most people have never heard of.</p>
<p>CFA recognizes and registers&nbsp;45 breeds, so cat shows are your chance to see unusual breeds including bengal, Norwegian forest cat, ocicat, ragamuffin and Scottish fold.</p>
<p>Veterinary cardiologist Eva Sikorska will be at the show scanning cats for HCM — hypertropic cardio myopathy. Thirty-eight cat breeders will pay $90 for the test. Responsible breeders do HCM scans and other genetic tests, and do not breed cats that could pass HCM or other health issues on to their kittens.</p>
<p>Vendors will be selling toys and other items for cats, and cat-themed clothing and gifts for the people who love cats.</p>
<p>Admission is $8 for adults, $7 for seniors and $6 for children.</p>
