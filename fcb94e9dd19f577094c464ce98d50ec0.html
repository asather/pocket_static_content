<h1>Mike Bloomberg hands DNC 'battleground states' campaign multi-million dollar boost</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Democratic National Committee’s organizing operation in Pennsylvania and several other key battleground states got a multi-million dollar boost on Friday from former presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign, which was self-funded by the New York City billionaire before he dropped out of the race and endorsed Joe Biden earlier this month, announced it would transfer $18 million to the committee to support its Battleground Build-Up 2020 program, which is focused on getting a head-start in the states that will be essential for Democrats if they want to win back the White House in November.</p>
<p>The contribution was announced by Mr. Bloomberg’s team on Friday and framed as a continuation of the former New York City mayor’s goal to help Democrats up and down the ballot.</p>
<p>In a memo to DNC Chair Tom Perez, Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign staff wrote that even though their candidate dropped from the primary, he still wants to help defeat Donald Trump — a necessity that has become more urgent as the spread of COVID-19 continues.</p>
<p>“The existential threat posed by Trump has become abundantly clear in his complete mismanagement of the Coronavirus crisis — a crisis that has profound implications for our economy, our public health and our way of life,” the memo read. “But we should also not assume that Trump’s incompetence will be enough to make him a one-term President.”</p>
<p>The Bloomberg team also plans to transfer several of its former field offices to state parties and “help accelerate the hiring pace for important positions in organizing, data, and operations across key battleground states,” according to the memo. Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign had five field offices in Pennsylvania, including one in East Liberty that the campaign opened just days before he dropped out. The other four were in the counties surrounding Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Staff in six battleground states will continue to be employed and paid through the first week of April, with full benefits continuing through the end of that month, the memo read. It did not mention which states.</p>
<p>The memo acknowledged that Mr. Bloomberg considered creating an independent entity to support the Democratic nominee, but added, “this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution.”</p>
<p>The DNC’s efforts battleground program was originally focused on Pennsylvania, Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin — though in February, expanded to Georgia, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Texas and Virginia as well.</p>
<p>“By investing in these states now, we’re putting the Trump campaign on defense, helping ensure our eventual nominee will be able grow their general election operation as quickly as possible, and helping make sure that every Democrat running for office has the infrastructure they need to be successful,” Mr. Perez said when the new slate of states was announced.</p>
