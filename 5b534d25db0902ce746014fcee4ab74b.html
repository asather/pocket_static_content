<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto announced Sunday the city would limit public gatherings to 50 people in an effort to reduce the spread of the deadly COVID-19 disease.</p>
<p>An executive order <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/13/mayor-bill-peduto-press-conference-covid-19-city-response-virus-residents/stories/202003130170" target="_blank">signed by Mr. Peduto</a> on Friday initially banned public gatherings to 250 people. But on Twitter Sunday night, the mayor announced he would be limiting occupancy levels even further.</p>
<p>“Today, the CDC recommended the cancellation of in-person events of 50 or more people. The city of Pittsburgh will adhere their advice,” Mr. Peduto tweeted.</p>
<p>Beginning 9 a.m. Monday, the city is requiring the cancellation of all events which exceed that level in the city.</p>
<p>Public safety will be enforcing the restrictions through regular measures of inspections and monitoring occupancy levels, mayoral spokesman Tim McNulty said.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, there are <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/15/Third-fourth-COVID-19-coronavirus-cases-Allegheny-County-health/stories/202003150123" target="_blank">four&nbsp;cases</a> in Allegheny County. County officials <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2020/03/15/Allegheny-County-calling-non-essential-businesses-close-voluntarily-coronavirus/stories/202003150149" target="_blank">announced</a> on Sunday they are calling on all nonessential businesses to close voluntarily for at least two weeks to help curb the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>“Looking at other communities and our own data, southwest Pennsylvania is about two weeks away from overwhelming our hospitals,” county Health Director Debra Bogen said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONSxcY0kiqw&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video statement</a>.</p>
