<h1>How many parking chairs is a safe distance? We're here to help</h1>

<p>How can we put this?</p>
<p>Pittsburgh, practice safe social distancing! If it's hard to remember what 6 feet of space looks like, maybe think in terms of some of our most beloved icons. Believe it or not, we actually got out a tape measure.</p>
<p>The possible combinations boggle the mind (see our graphic). We used just a few, but here are some more: one 6-0 Kris Letang, stretched out on the ice to block a puck. Or perhaps 6 Pitt Panthers football helmets, or 6 neatly folded Mister Rogers cardigans will suffice. For you <em>artistes</em>, how about 3 of Warhol's "Brillo Box" sculptures?</p>
<p>And finally, 2 Gene Kelly "Singinâ€™ In The Rain" bumbershoots. That might be a wee bit over 6 feet wide, but then, all the better. Yinz stay safe out there.</p>
