<h1>No time for posturing: Wolf, Republicans need to find common ground </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As is often the case when it comes to Pennsylvania politics, the decisions regarding the reopening of the state’s businesses amid the COVID-19 outbreak moved from the cooperative to the confrontational over the last few weeks. And no one is served by the ongoing vitriol, political posturing and name-calling that is now on full display.</p>
<p>Elected officials in a handful of counties that are still designated in the “red” phase by Gov. Tom Wolf, and thus subject to the most-stringent shutdown orders, have openly defied the governor and announced plans to move to the “yellow” phase and reopen businesses. District attorneys in some of those counties have said they will not prosecute businesses that reopen without state approval.</p>
<p>That prompted Mr. Wolf to lash out at those officials, calling the threat to reopen without authorization a “cowardly act” that could cost lives. He threatened to withhold federal stimulus money to those counties, and to withhold licenses from agencies such as the Liquor Control Board and Health Department for businesses that open before authorized.</p>
<p>Neither action — by defiant county officials or Mr. Wolf — is helpful or allays the concerns of business owners on the brink of economic devastation or residents who fear being infected by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The county officials threatening to defy the state order are not engaging in cowardly acts as much as acts of desperation to protect small businesses in their communities. Conversely, Mr. Wolf is not looking to punish some counties by keeping them in the red classification, but is instead trying to balance public health with economic needs.</p>
<p>These do not have to be mutually exclusive goals. Unfortunately, neither side seems able to hear the other above the roar of political rhetoric.</p>
<p>The Republican-controlled Legislature, a consistent critic of Mr. Wolf, has repeatedly tried to push through bills that would speed up business reopening or remove the decision making from the Democratic governor. Mr. Wolf has vetoed such efforts and the courts, thus far, have ruled in favor of his emergency power during a crisis.</p>
<p>The problem is that some of those proposals offered reasonable approaches, but Mr. Wolf seems uninterested in or unable to negotiate with Republican leaders on these points.</p>
<p>And the Wolf administration has not done itself or the public much good by the way it has managed aspects of the crisis. There has been notable inconsistency in determining what businesses could remain open and a complete lack of transparency in the waiver program for business exemptions.</p>
<p>We will be dealing with the effects of COVID-19 for many more weeks and months. The virus will not disappear overnight and will likely impact us for years. This is a time not for posturing, but for compromise and dealing. If Mr. Wolf is unable to reach reasonable compromise, he should find someone in his administration who can work with his opponents. Likewise, Republican leaders must be willing to negotiate rather than dictate.</p>
<p>There is plenty of middle ground to be found, if there is the political will.</p>
<p>Already there are signs of potential compromise. Two counties that had threatened to defy the governor’s shutdown orders — Dauphin and Schuylkill — have since backed off. Those officials are the ones the Wolf administration should be talking with to understand their concerns and attempt to find workable solutions.</p>
<p>This is no time for postures of moral superiority. It is a time for finding common ground in order to get things done. Everyone wants the same thing, after all — a safe way for businesses and agencies to reopen based on reliable data, while protecting public health and keeping COVID-19 from overwhelming us. The way to achieve both goals is to tone down the politics and de-emphasize the polarization. The commonwealth needs the governor to lead in that effort not to retard it.</p>
