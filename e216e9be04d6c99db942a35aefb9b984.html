<h1>Pat Narduzzi mum on Pitt's COVID absentees ahead of ACC opener</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Coaches tend to take things week by week, game by game. It’s a common stance, one Pat Narduzzi subscribes to. But what is sometimes viewed as a cliche or verbal crutch is actually legitimate this season due to COVID-19, as evidence of Narduzzi’s message to his players following Pitt’s 55-0 season-opening win over Austin Peay.</p>
<p>“You’ve earned the right to play one game,” Narduzzi told the Panthers in the Heinz Field locker room. “Now earn the right to play two.”</p>
<p>Pitt is scheduled to play its second game this weekend, a noon kick on Saturday at home against Syracuse. But whether or not the Panthers will be at full capacity is another issue.</p>
<p>Seven Pitt players were not in attendance for the Austin Peay game “due to COVID-related protocols.” But Narduzzi didn’t say who those seven players are and if all are positive tests or byproducts of the contact tracing process. He also declined on Monday to acknowledge if they will be available against Syracuse.</p>
<p>One of those players is starting defensive end Rashad Weaver, who tweeted in frustration that last week’s COVID-19 testing results were “not adding up” and conflicting with different companies involved. Pitt uses BioReference Laboratories in New Jersey for its Sunday and Wednesday testing, while the ACC administers a Friday test through MAKO Medical in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Weaver was not present at Heinz Field on Saturday, even asking Twitter followers for a streaming link to watch the game. Defensive tackle Keyshon Camp was also not in attendance, as the ACC Network broadcast team lumped him in with Weaver when discussing the team’s COVID-19 absences.</p>
<p>“Anybody that’s not playing, whether it’s an injury or some other reason, they’re all eager to come back,” Narduzzi said when asked specifically about Weaver, who missed all of last season with an ACL tear. “You’ve just got to wait your time. They all know how it has to go. They know the process. Everybody’s eager. But you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do.”</p>
<p>Right now, that “process” involves self-isolation and plenty of Zoom calls.</p>
<p>Team members who test positive for COVID-19 enter an isolated quarantine at an undisclosed on-campus location, away from teammates, coaches and roommates. And the “quarantine clock” covers the 10 days following the positive test date. So in a normal game week, any player that tests negative on Sunday and Wednesday but tests positive on Friday would be isolated and held out of not only that weekend’s game, but also the following game.</p>
<p>Narduzzi declined to say when Pitt’s positive cases actually tested positive.</p>
<p>But those that do, and those quarantining at home after contact tracing, are still involved with the team. They’re just popping in virtually.</p>
<p>“It’s just the protocol we have to go through. They’re going to sit on Zoom calls,” Narduzzi said. “Whether it’s a team meeting and the iPad is sitting in front of me in the indoor facility as we’re socially distanced, or if they’re with their position coaches, they don’t want to miss a beat. They’re happy to be on a Zoom call. Let’s put it that way. That’s all they get. So you get stripped of everything. You’re in isolation. You’re locked down. You’ve got your cell phone, your iPad and you’ve got a bed.”</p>
<p>“You know, things happen, and you don’t know how they happen,” Narduzzi said earlier. “This building is safe. I feel good when they’re here. I can’t babysit them every minute of the day. We talk all the time about being safe. Just hope they’re being safe out there and washing their hands.”</p>
<p><strong>Injury update</strong></p>
<p>Pitt defensive end Habakkuk Baldonado is considered “day-to-day” after leaving Saturday’s game with an undisclosed injury, Narduzzi said.</p>
<p>Baldonado, an effective second-string pass-rusher who logged four sacks last season, went down in the first half. After being evaluated by trainers, the 6-foot-5, 250-pound redshirt sophomore was carted off the field.</p>
<p>However, Narduzzi typically announces season-ending injuries. So while the injury looked bad, it seems Pitt will get Baldonado back in short order, if not this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking reaction</strong></p>
<p>Pitt was ranked in the newest Associated Press poll, coming in at No. 25 overall. It was the first time the Panthers have been ranked since Nov. 2018 — but it might feel a little hollow with the teams and conferences not playing no longer considered in the voting.</p>
<p>That’s how Narduzzi feels at least.</p>
<p>“I don’t really care about it,” the coach said. “I don’t even want our kids to look at it. I’d rather be disrespected like we’ve been and play with a grudge and a chip on our shoulder. ... And with less conferences out there, does it really matter? You know? There are less people playing. So it matters less this year than it mattered a year ago.”</p>
<p><strong>Game time announced</strong></p>
<p>Pitt fans with Comcast will have to make alternative plans next weekend.</p>
<p>The Panthers’ Sept. 26 home game against No. 18 Louisville will kick at noon and air on ACC Network. It is Pitt’s third consecutive game to start the season that will be televised on the ESPN-affiliated network.</p>
<p>Louisville hosts ESPN’s College GameDay this weekend and plays No. 17 Miami at 7:30 p.m. Saturday on ABC.</p>
