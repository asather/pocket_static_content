<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 01.08.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The early returns are in on your questions (I peeked) and they're not favorable...we will start our chat in about 30 min. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, let's get our chat started. Go...!!</p>
<p><strong>Coach15</strong>: Realistic chances of retaining Dupree &amp; Big Ben being <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: As they said about Tiger's putt on the 17th island green at TPC Sawgrass a number of years ago -- "Better than most."</p>
<p><strong>Coach15</strong>: What is the chance, WR D Cain is retained, &amp; becomes a significant part of the offense, &amp; drop the thoughts of drafting a WR, as Steelers need to plug a hole or two, &amp; spend draft picks on other positions? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You mean taking a guy from a practice squad and having him magically become a significant part of an offense?? Uh...hmmmmm....let's see.....no.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong>: To clear cap space release McDonald, Barron, Chickillo, Berry and Foster? That would create over 20 Mil to sign DuPree and another free agent. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Don't worry, some of that will happen.</p>
<p><strong>Coach15</strong>: By scanning MANY other teams, seems they work their youngsters/rookies onto the field, much sooner than Pittsburgh--Often you hear, a player can't get on the field bc he doesn't know the playbook or scheme, so which is it, drafting slow-learners or too complicated of systems? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yeah, it really took the Steelers a long time to get Terrell Edmunds on the field when he led all NFL rookies in snaps played in 2018; and just about as long to get Devin Bush on the field when he played more snaps than any inside linebacker and all but two players among the front seven.</p>
<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Will Switzer be back now that Johnson has usurped him? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I would expect so. They still keep six WRs.</p>
<p><strong>Michelle</strong>: Any chance to resign both Hargrave and DuPree in 2020? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Sure, it just depends what Hargrave thinks he is worth, i.e., can he get a much bigger deal on the open market? Let's not go overboard on Hargrave now. He's a nice player but he's certainly not to key to the defensive line, much less the overall scheme of the defense.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: With Ben doing virtually nothing in the pre-season year after year, does he have to do more this year to show he's healthy and deserves his bloated contract? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they might try to play him a little more, maybe by the second game for a series or two, just to see how he's progressing. Then again, they might not play him at all if they think they just want to wait to the regular season. I could see both happening.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: What position do you anticipate the Steelers choosing at 50 in April? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: RB or TE.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa</strong>: Will Edmunds keep a helmet or is it time to admit the poor choice of a player and move on? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes he will. And I think it's to early to admit he was a poor choice. Not everyone is Troy Polamalu after all.</p>
<p><strong>Sandy</strong>: Should ?Pittsburgh expect to be forced onto Hard Kncoks next year? As a fan, <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They might have to. Just like being asked to play on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day in the same year.</p>
<p><strong>Allison </strong>: What changes do you see in the coaching staff taking place? Butler? Fichtner? Smith? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not anything of significance. But I do think they will add a QB coach, something they are already discussing.</p>
<p><strong>Coach15</strong>: Seems to me, when Steelers have a lead or sorta behind &amp; game outta control, why not place a guy or two in the game, &amp; give him some experience &amp; give the starter/vet a break, for health reasons---I'd think you would have a player or two on each side of the ball that you could get a # of plays over the period of 3-4 games-Seems every time Steelers have to go to backup, there is an issue of, dialing back the schemes or playbook---It's there job--ship them if they're not ready or draft better- <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I understand your point and I don't totally disagree. But go back over the past decade, even longer, and count how many times the Steelers have been involved in blowouts, good or bad. It's not a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Erik</strong>: Tepper to N.C. or staying in Pitt? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think he's going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Andy</strong>: Of the 22 full time starters, who were your most disappointing in 2019? Heck throw in kicker and punter too. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, you don't have to throw in the kicker because there was nothing disappointing about the way he responded. But, to your question, pick between Vance McDonald, James Conner and JuJu.</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong>: Washington, Johnson and Ju-Ju as top 3 wr's in 2020? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Sure. You expecting someone else? But don't be surprised if there's another rookie in there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Coach15</strong>: There has to be countless punters with NFL game &amp; camp experience, plus college overflow, &amp; Canadian, &amp; Pittsburgh can't find anyone to improve on what they currently have--they won't come to them, they must got GET/FIND them---heck I can go to the local pub &amp; come up with someone as successful as what they currently have- <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'll tell them to start hanging in some pubs.</p>
<p><strong>Rahn</strong>: Was the Cowboys talk with Marvin Lewis just a way to check the Rooney Rule box? There was zero chance he was getting the job. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Marvin Lewis is a very good coach.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Wallace </strong>: Where will the Steelers draft position be this year ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: What round? They dont draft until the 50th spot, if that's what you mean</p>
<p><strong>Coach15</strong>: I am somewhat surprised, that Steelers or any other team does NOT, find more players in the CFL--I find it hard to believe that there isn't a player north of the border, that is not any better than what Steelers have, amongst their last 8-12 guys on roster--If you need a certain position--seems with some scouting/research &amp; work, you can find ONE player at that position, that would be an upgrade over current <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: So now you've gone from the pubs to north of the border.</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Hey Gerry. I've watched a lot more college football this year than ever before. My observation is that the NFL morphed into the college game. Especially on offense. Am I way off base with that assessment or do you agree? I'm not a fan of this transformation btw if true.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You're not off base so much as you're running out of the base path. Parts of the college game are morphing into the NFL with the types of QBs we are seeing (Lamar Jackson) and some of the plays being motioned in from the sideline before the snap. But, if anything, the NFL is morphing back to its old days, with more teams looking to be able to run the ball again.</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Why does everyone think it is a slam dunk that the Steelers will be on Hard Knocks this year??? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Because, of the available teams who haven't been on, the Steelers are easily the most desirable. Heck, the Steelers are the most desirable of just about ANY team in the league.</p>
<p><strong>Rahn</strong>: How much blame do you put on coaching re: the disappointing season from the OL? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: While I believe the NFL is more of a coaches league than any other professional sport, I also believe the coaches can sometimes only do so much with some of these guys. But, if I had to choose, I'd side with your thought.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: Money looks to be tight if Dupree is tagged, but Steelers still like to bring in one or two free agents each year. What position do you think they target for outside help this year before the draft? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Cap money is always tight for them and they always find a way. But I wouldn't be surprised to see them sign a guard, safety or even tight end in free agency.</p>
<p><strong>Rahn</strong>: Gut feeling: Will Roethlisberger's elbow injury be the final straw for his career a la Bradshaw? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. Bradshaw had surgery without telling the Steelers and he rushed his rehab back in training camp, further injuring his elbow. That wont happen w Ben.</p>
<p><strong>Rahn</strong>: What's the staff's feeling on Buggs? Will he be in the rotation next year or is he just a depth guy? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, that's one of the things they will watch as he jumps from year 1 to year 2.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: Many people seem to want Barron cut to free up money. I personally would like to see him stick around. But, if Steelers need to move from him, wouldn't he be a trade candidate - maybe a fourth or fifth? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think you are going to see that.</p>
<p><strong>Rahn</strong>: Based on your breakdown, you think Berry comes back? His botches in big spots with field position... there have to be better options coming out of college, no? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Perhaps. And, if there is, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they go look at one. All I know is a punter never won or lost a Super Bowl, or determined a team's chances of getting there. If you think that's the case, you are not paying attention.</p>
<p><strong>Jwandburgh </strong>: Dupree more likely to be tagged at 16M and take that. Or Steelers goal is to work on a long term deal even with looming huge extension for Watt in 2021? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The long-term money is being earmarked by Watt. Even Dupree knows that.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Do you expect the Steelers to make a run at a starting quality free agent QB with no guarantee that Ben R. will return to form at his age? For the only team that keeps 3 QBs having a 3rd stringer with better talent than Duck should have been hard to do. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they will make a run at a QB, but not a quality free agent like Mariota or Bridgewater or someone like that. First off, those players will go somewhere where they can be the starter. Second, the Steelers look at Mason Rudolph as their No. 2 QB. Anyone they might bring in will be a third guy right now.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Sunner in Orlando</strong>: With Barron and Williams on their way out do the Steelers need to draft an ILB or sign one through free agency? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Who says they are on their way out???</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Gerry - would a non-conclusive update on Ben's progress in February be considered a negative? I guess the proof in that pudding will be seen in what happens in free agency? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm sure the update will be nothing but positive. I don't think anything that comes from that will be cause for any type of move.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: The performance of Mason, at his age and team tenure, was fine. What do folks expect? Bringing in a quality veteran is fine but not a top 3 priority. Agree? We need a consistent TE, in-line blocker and explosive RB before we spend $ on 3rd string QB. Mason was fine before he got clobbered (literary and figuratively) <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes, I agree. See earlier answer for proof.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Do you think Ben would or could restructure his new deal to provide 2020 cap space? Extend a year with only a few million more? He has a 2 year window and the Steelers can get close with a few moves. Possible or fantasy? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Of course it's possible. But this is also the first year that his new deal kicks in.</p>
<p><strong>Batdog</strong>: What does it take for Tomlin to take special teams seriously and get rid of Smith and Berry? I don't remember one kickoff return past the 25 and Berry just stinks. I know you can give me stats that say he wasn't that bad but what do your eyes tell you watching the game? I see a below average punter. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Their longest kick return was 34 yards. And Berry's problem is his inconsistency and his failure to take advantage of long fields with big kicks. But I think all of you are overestimating the value of a punter. I'm not saying Berry is terrific, but he's not horrible either. Averaged 45.5 yards per punt and didn't have one blocked.</p>
<p><strong>Gravel</strong>: Hi Gerry - Thanks for the chats and your coverage via the PG. How much say does anyone other than MT have on the coaching staff? If you were in charge, would you add a QB coach or add a new OC and perhaps demote Randy? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes, Art Rooney II has say over all matters, including deciding if they will hire a QB coach. But not only do I think they need one, they are looking into the possibility (likelihood?).</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Gerry - What is your best guess on what Kevin Colbert does following the completion of the draft? Stay for awhile, stay for just a little while, or punch out....take a break? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think he will be back.</p>
<p><strong>Kielbasa Head</strong>: Hi Gerry, if you were GM would you consider a different OC? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I wouldn't decide that until Ben comes back. Because it doesn't seem to matter who is the offensive coordinator with No. 7. He has had 4 -- Whisenhunt, Arians, Haley and Fichtner -- and it doesn't seem to have bothered him at all.</p>
<p><strong>Grossman R</strong>: This is reportedly a very bad year for tight ends? Does that making drafting one at 50 less likely? Gracias. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think that will be determined until after the combine. But maybe.</p>
<p><strong>PM</strong>: Do you think next season is a big one for Juju in determining whether he really is a #1WR? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think the objective is to prove he's a No. 1 receiver. The objective is to show he can be a productive receiver like 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Goldstar</strong>: Do you think the way Lamar plays the game is sustainable in the long term or will he need to morph into the R Wilson type of QB? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Eventually those hits will catch up to him, especially when he signs that $100 million contract.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: do you believe #21 will command starters money in FA? Would love him back on a one year deal to provide depth even if we have to pay up a bit. FS proved to be a game changer for the D. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes. He will go somewhere where he can be a starter. That's not here.</p>
<p><strong>Goldstar</strong>: Do you think the Steelers should lock up JuJu longer term now or wait to see if this year was closer to reality w/o AB? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's a good question. I know this, they don't want him to leave, that's for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Edwards Glen</strong>: Anything to talk of turning Edwards into a dime backer? What is considered his strong suit, besides low body fat? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Earl</strong>: If Hargrave does leave in FA, is there anyone on the roster that you think could adequately fill the position? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: As a nose tackle, no. As a sub package DE, yeah....Tuitt.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: Which team has the greater chance of turning things around: Steelers with a good offseason, Bengals with a #1 QB or Browns with a new coach? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Now what do you think...??</p>
<p><strong>Tomás</strong>: Hi Gerry! Did you see the Steelers parting ways with Vance McDonald. I think that we should go for a young TE instead of continue signing injuries prone TE. What is your opinion? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No because then they would be left with nobody at tight end. They don't have anyone on the roster who is ready or able to assume that role. Even if they draft one, which they should, they still need two guys who can be productive.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Hi Gerry - Hopefully you are more amenable to answering hypotheticals than MT. Given concerns on durability, why not trade Tuitt for draft choice and use dollars saved to sign Hargrave. Feasible from a pure business perspective? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: And why would you want to trade Tuitt?? I can tell you, they don't. Nor are they considering.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: I believe the offense was terrible because of lack of experience at QB and WR and no consistent TE and RB. OC was not the problem. Agree? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Gerry - it was hard to tell bc Duck didn't seem to have the arm strength to take advantage, but does Deon Cain have the speed to be a threat to stretch the field when Ben is back? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I like Deon Cain, but training camp will tell us if that's the case.</p>
<p><strong>PM</strong>: Do you think the steelers should start to transition to being a heavy running team? With Ben's arm a question at this point it might be something to look into? The style has certainly worked with the ravens and titans as well as the seahawks this season <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, but they should go back to running the ball more....and better. And that will start will having a No. 1 running back. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, that's all the time we have today. See you next week.</p>
