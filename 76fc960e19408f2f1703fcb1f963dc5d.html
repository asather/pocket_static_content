<h1>Epilepsy fundraiser switches to virtual run/walk on Facebook Live</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This Saturday is the 32nd annual run/walk to benefit the Epilepsy Association of Western and Central Pennsylvania. This time, no running or walking is required because it’s virtual.</p>
<p>Each year, up to 2,000 people take part in the <a href="https://www.eawcp.org/Module/Calendar/EventDetail?id=141" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Family Fun Run/Walk for Epilepsy</a>, said EAWCP President and CEO Peggy Beem Jelley. But this year, with the group’s runners and walkers sidelined by COVID-19 restrictions, only 458 people and 74 teams had signed up as of Thursday afternoon. You can register or donate at <a href="https://p2p.onecause.com/pittsburgh" target="_blank">www.eawcp.org</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook Live coverage starts at 9:30 a.m. with messages from chairpeople and administrators and stories shared by people living with epilepsy. Though no one has to run or walk to be part of the event, at least 30 friends and members of the Hewalt family will be doing that — at a social distance —&nbsp;on Saturday at&nbsp;Good Shepherd Lutheran Church of South Hills, 418 Maxwell Drive, Whitehall (15236).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul and Lauren Hewalt, both 38, of Baldwin Borough, have participated every year since 2018, when their son, Logan, 11, was diagnosed with epilepsy.</p>
<p>“We wanted to get everyone together to signify the importance of raising awareness about the struggles people with epilepsy live with every day,” Mrs. Hewalt said.</p>
<p>She said EAWCP has been a “lifesaver” for resources and education. After Logan had seizures at school, the organization did a day of training for his teachers on epilepsy. It’s one of the resources this event helps to support.</p>
<p>“He has the type of epilepsy that causes him to stare off into space,” Mrs. Hewalt said. “People have this misconception that it’s like the movies where people fall to the ground or start shaking, but it’s not always like that.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the organization held run/walks in Erie and Altoona in partnership with Highmark. Another virtual fundraiser is scheduled Aug. 1 in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>This is the epilepsy association’s biggest fundraiser, netting about $100,000 each year. So far, it has raised $60,865 of the $125,000 goal. Organizers are hopeful they’ll make it since the donation site will be open for a few weeks after the event.</p>
<p>“All of the money raised stays here,” Ms. Beem Jelley said.</p>
<p>The EAWCP provides educational and family programs like summer camps and financial assistance for emergency needs and epilepsy medication.</p>
<p>​Run/walk participants who raise at least $30 receive a T-shirt and qualify for prizes based on how much they raise. Grand prizes will be awarded to the top three fundraising individuals and teams.&nbsp;For more information, go to <a href="http://www.eawcp.org" target="_blank">www.eawcp.org</a> or call 1-800-361-5885.</p>
