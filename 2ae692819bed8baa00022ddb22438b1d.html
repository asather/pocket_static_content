<h1>Colin Moran knows defensive improvements must happen now</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — When Colin Moran took a step back and evaluated his 2019 season, he was at least somewhat happy with his offensive production. In his second full MLB season, Moran slashed .277/.322/.429 and had an OPS of .751. He hit 13 home runs and amassed 80 RBIs — the second of those numbers trailing only Josh Bell (116) and Starling Marte (82) on the Pirates.</p>
<p>But Moran was hardly satisfied with the year that he had, in large part because his defense stunk. He made 14 errors and, by pretty much any metric, graded out as one of the worst defensive performers in all of baseball.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I definitely think I did some things well, but I’m trying to focus on what I need to do better,” Moran said Wednesday at Pirate City.</span></p>
<p>After saying much of the same stuff last year, how he’s looking to have an improved defensive season, it’s time for Moran to make good on that promise on 2020 if he wants to keep a regular role.</p>
<p>Behind him is the Pirates’ top position player prospect, Ke’Bryan Hayes, whose elite glove seems perfectly suited for Pittsburgh’s new defense-first philosophy. Furthermore, Hayes is probably a hot offensive start from getting a chance with the major league club.</p>
<p>But Moran is also a new dad — he and his wife, Kelsey, welcomed a baby girl (Oaklyn) in December — and obviously does not want to cede his starting spot. So the 27-year-old third baseman spent this offseason trying to do anything and everything to spur some defensive change.</p>
<p>Moran huddled with the Pirates’ analytics team and tried to learn more about his positioning. He also focused on first-step quickness and has taken a greater interest in how hitters are attacked, using intel gleaned from Pittsburgh’s pitchers and catchers to gain a better feel for when, where and how the ball might come to him.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Stuff that can help me gain a step,” Moran said. “I think that helps the most.”</span></p>
<p>It certainly can’t hurt. In 2019, only Hunter Dozier (minus-14) in Kansas City had a worst mark among third baseman when it came to FanGraphs’ Defensive Runs Saved; Moran was at minus-13. Moran’s Ultimate Zone Rating of minus-8.8 was also second-worst at his position, while his error total and fielding percentage (.938) were similarly well below acceptable range; only six third basemen fared worse among those who played at least 300 innings.</p>
<p>Such shortcomings are not news to Moran, who said he’s very much aware of his defensive struggles and the need to improve in relatively short order.</p>
<p>“I understand all the numbers are down on me, but I feel like I catch and throw well,” Moran said. “I catch the balls that are hit at me. If I can just learn to utilize some agility and range, that would be ideal. I’m working as hard as I can to be good.”</p>
<p>None of this is easy on Moran, who admitted that he’s unduly hard on himself for his fielding issues, often carrying bad games with him for entirely too long and glossing over some of the positive things he did.</p>
<p>But given Moran’s precarious position, it’s also necessary. Not only does he need to hit well to fend off Hayes, but he’s going to have to show some modicum of improvement with the glove if he doesn’t want to be relegated to a bench role once Hayes is ready.</p>
<p>“People probably get tired of hearing that until you get better, so I’m looking forward to getting better,” Moran said. “Obviously it’s a production league. You can work on whatever you want, but at the end of the day you have to produce. I’m looking forward to getting out there.”</p>
<p>This offseason has been a nice dose of perspective for the quiet Moran, who’s one of the more reserved players in the Pirates clubhouse. Helping Kelsey parent Oaklyn has enabled Colin to worry less about baseball and simply focus on doing his job, which could help once the grind of the season starts.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Since I started playing baseball, I’ve always kind of stressed a little bit too much on the negative,” Moran said. “I’m definitely looking forward to focusing on more positive things. I’m going to try and make an effort on that. But also it just gives me an ability to not care about baseball once I get home, which is awesome. It gives me perspective on what’s important.”</span></p>
<p>What will be important on the field for Moran will be part physical, but it will also involve avoiding the mental mistakes that have plagued him in the past, things such as occasionally throwing to the wrong base, avoiding what he called “brain lapses” or stuff “that I don’t ever want to do again.”</p>
<p>Only time will tell if the work Moran has put in this offseason will pay off. However, if Moran is to keep a regular role, it will also be necessary for him to finally put it into practice.</p>
<p>“As long as I can help the team,” Moran said, “that’s all I’m really worried about.”</p>
