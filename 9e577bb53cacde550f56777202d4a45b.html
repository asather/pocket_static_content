<p>Images capture little more than a white dot zipping across gray static. Without the helpful green circle, it’s easy to miss.</p>
<p>But two astronomers soon recognized the speck on their screens as something special: a likely “mini-moon” caught orbiting the Earth, only the second ever recorded.</p>
<p>With close to a million known asteroids — rubble from the birth of our solar system — but hardly any spotted circling our planet, this roughly compact-car-sized object is “a big deal,” tweeted Kacper Wierzchos, one of the people who made the discovery.</p>
<p>Astronomers expect mini-moon sightings to grow far more common as a new, giant telescope going up in Chile starts scanning the sky. It’s an exciting prospect for scientists interested in someday sending a spacecraft to study one of the rocks and maybe even bring it back to Earth.</p>
<p>“These asteroids are what built the planets,” said Scott Sheppard, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science. “And if these things are in orbit of Earth, they’re very easy for us to get to.”</p>
<p>There’s no time to plan such a visit to 2020 CD3, the mini-moon discovered this month by staff of a NASA-funded, Arizona-based project called the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS). The object is already getting fainter, and next month it will slip away from the Earth’s gravity to join other asteroids hurtling around the Sun, said Eric Christensen, who directs the CSS.</p>
<p>But 2020 CD3 will be back.</p>
<p>“It’s likely coming to pay us another visit in another 25 or 50 years,” Mr. Christensen said.</p>
<p>Hosted in Tucson by the University of Arizona, the CSS is devoted to tracking “near-Earth objects.” Worried about asteroids that could hit the Earth and do serious damage, lawmakers have set a goal of cataloging at least 90% of these near-Earth objects above a certain size.</p>
<p>An automated system at CSS collects pictures throughout the night and then tries to spot moving objects, Mr. Christensen explained. Then astronomers take a look and decide which ones they should report.</p>
<p>The images the project captured of the mini-moon on the night of Feb. 15 look a lot like any other asteroid streaking across the sky, he added. It wasn’t until the next day that staff decided they probably had an object temporarily “captured” by Earth.</p>
<p>They still have questions.</p>
<p>Exactly what the object is made of is not yet clear, researchers say. They also aren’t totally sure how long 2020 CD3 has been orbiting us. It’s at least a year, maybe a few.</p>
<p>The Catalina Sky Survey also discovered the one other mini-moon on record, in 2006. That object is expected to come back in 2028.</p>
