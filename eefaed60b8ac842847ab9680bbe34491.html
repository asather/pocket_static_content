<p>Police are searching for a missing 20-year-old woman who was last seen January in Etna.</p>
<p>Kaylene Oehling wears brown framed glasses and goes by the name “Kaylene Young,” the Etna Police Department shared in a Facebook post Thursday. Police said she stands about 5’2, weighs 110 pounds, has dark brown hair and brown eyes.&nbsp;It is unclear what Ms. Oehling was last seen wearing.</p>
<p>She was last seen Jan. 9 in the borough, but last made contact with her mom in a phone call around 1:36 a.m. the following day, police said. She has not been heard from since.</p>
<p>She also stopped using her social media after that time, “which is not like her,” police shared.&nbsp;She left without her medication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone with information on her whereabouts is asked to contact the Etna Police Department at 412-781-6271.</p>
