<h1>Downtown bomb suspect indicted by federal grand jury</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Duquesne Heights man has been indicted by a federal grand jury&nbsp;for allegedly placing a bag of bombs in some bushes near 2 PNC Plaza on May 31.</p>
<p>The grand jury charged Matthew Michanowicz, 52, with possession of an unregistered destructive device.</p>
<p>He had previously been charged by complaint, after which prosecutors have 30 days to seek an indictment.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office said Mr. Michanowicz planted a backpack filled with homemade Molotov cocktails during protests of the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>At the time of the complaint, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady characterized Mr. Michanowicz as an agitator.</p>
<p>"He wasn't there to protest," he said. "He was there to engage in violent attacks."</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police on June 1 were called to PNC Plaza for a report of a suspicious military-style green backpack near a bike rack under some trees. Police discovered three explosive devices and detected a foul odor and called in the bomb squad.</p>
<p>The devices were "spent OC vapor grenades," prosecutors said, and had wicks attached to held in place by spray foam insulation.</p>
<p>Security footage from PNC showed an older man possessing the bag where it was found who was riding a blue bike with a bright red pouch on the handlebars. On June 3, police on patrol saw a man with a bike matching that description at the place where the bag had been found on June 1 and took Mr. Michanowicz into custody.</p>
<p>Mr. Michanowicz faces a detention hearing in federal court on July 7.</p>
