<h1>Firefighters respond to blaze at roofing company in Esplen</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Emergency crews Monday responded to a fire that erupted at a roofing and sheet metal contractor in Pittsburgh’s Esplen neighborhood.</p>
<p>Firefighters and police received the fire call shortly before 8:30 a.m. at MTG Roofing (Miller-Thomas-Gyekis Inc.) in the 3300 block of Stafford Street, according to city fire officials.&nbsp;No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s Hazmat Battalion Chief Bernard Mohan said insulation, roofing material and tar caught fire.&nbsp;Large plumes of smoke could be seen several miles away.</p>
<p>He said firefighters had a hard time fighting the blaze due to&nbsp;“access issues.”</p>
<p>“Based on the conditions that we had, we had to rotate crews out because of the temperature,” he said. “We had to have extra water delivered. Crews did a good job of getting in there and getting the fire under control. We had to wait for the power company to secure the power lines.</p>
<p>“It was a deep-seated fire” confined to a storage area, Chief Mohan said at the scene.</p>
<p>“It’s challenging, [but] we do have precautions in place [and] we have safety officers ... we have rehabilitation units so that we can monitor hydration levels ... we put a schedule together to rotate crews in and out so that we’re not overtaxing in this heat.”</p>
<p>He said the cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p>
