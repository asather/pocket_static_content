<h1>Pirates GM Ben Cherington on Oneil Cruz, Cole Tucker and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the tragic situation involving Pirates prospect Oneil Cruz continues to evolve in the Dominican Republic, Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said Wednesday he has “no reason to believe” the 21-year-old wouldn’t be available for spring training.</p>
<p>“No information that I have that would suggest he wouldn’t be,” Cherington said on a Zoom call with local reporters.</p>
<p>According to authorities, Cruz was driving a white Jeep on Sanchez Highway between Bani and San Cristóbal last week when his vehicle struck a motorcycle. Three people — ages 19, 20 and 23 — died as a result of the incident.&nbsp;Cruz posted two million pesos — a little more than $34,000 — in bail for his involvement in the crash Friday and was told he would have to meet with authorities periodically as a condition of the bail.</p>
<p>Cherington’s comments Wednesday are in line with his <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/09/27/pirates-ben-cherington-oneil-cruz-update-dominican-republic/stories/202009270198" target="_blank">other recent comments on Cruz</a>, saying that nothing he nor the Pirates have seen would point to the incident being anything other than an extremely unfortunate accident.</p>
<p>“This is a young man with a really bright future who was involved in a bad accident,” Cherington said Sunday on his weekly radio show on 93.7 The Fan. “I want to emphasize that word: accident. There is not a single piece of evidence that we’ve seen that this is anything but an accident. Everything we’ve learned, including from Oneil and his family is consistent with that. Grieving needs to happen, certainly for the families of the victims, but also for Oneil. We will support him. It’s just a really hard and tragic situation.”</p>
<p>From a baseball perspective, Cruz is extremely important to the Pirates’ future.&nbsp;He is their third-best prospect, according to MLB Pipeline, and the 6-foot-6 shortstop represents probably the best power-hitter among their prospects. At the very least, Cruz’s presence in spring training and another step up the organizational ladder would mean another step closer to Cruz’s major-league debut, which, ideally, would be another positive step in the Pirates’ rebuild.</p>
<p>Those are things to worry about down the line, though. For now, the Pirates are simply giving Cruz their support in any way he needs it. Such a horrific event calls for delicacy among all concerned parties.</p>
<p>“Oneil is a young player and a young person now that has been through something very traumatic, and we’re going to continue to work with him, support him through it,” Cherington said Wednesday. “He’s been incredibly cooperative throughout this, done everything that’s been asked of him, so that’s all the information we have right now.”</p>
<p><strong>Where will Tucker play?</strong></p>
<p>One of the smaller Pirates storylines this season was Cole Tucker’s move to the outfield. One of the organization’s top prospects from years past, the 24-year-old was always an infielder and debuted as such in 2019.</p>
<p>When right fielder Gregory Polanco tested positive for COVID-19 at the beginning of the 2020 regular season, the Pirates needed some outfield depth, and Tucker’s athleticism made him an obvious candidate to attempt a move out there. He did and spent all but three defensive innings in the outfield during the season.</p>
<p>While that could reasonably be viewed as a strong investment in a young player, moving to a new position and getting plenty of opportunities, manager Derek Shelton said they aren’t committed to strictly keeping Tucker in the outfield.</p>
<p>“We still view him as an infielder on both sides of the ball in the middle of the infield, to play second and to play short, just like the ability of [Adam] Frazier we saw of going into the outfield,” Shelton said Wednesday. “I think when you have more options, then you have more versatility, it provides more opportunities. ... It’s going to be a competitive environment when we come into spring training in 2021. It’s something that we’ve been very honest with our group about. There’s some options in the middle, and those guys in the middle can play in other places.”</p>
<p><strong>Draft order</strong></p>
<p>One of the lone positives of the Pirates’ bad season is the opportunity it gives them in the 2021 MLB draft. In a normal season, the Pirates, holding the worst record in the league, would have been set up for the No. 1 pick in the next season’s draft.</p>
<p>In 2020, however, there were rumors that wouldn’t be the way it’s run. With a smaller sample size over 60 games, there was a thought that MLB could implement some sort of lottery or average teams’ records from the last two seasons to give a truer representation of the status of organizations, thus setting a more fair draft order.</p>
<p>ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported earlier this week, however, that the draft order would be in reverse order of standings. Cherington said Wednesday that he hasn’t heard any confirmation on anything, but he has no reason to believe the draft order will be anything other than a reverse order of the standings.</p>
<p>Really, though, it doesn’t change much in the way the Pirates prepare. Neither does the date change, moving the draft from its originally scheduled time in June. What does affect the Pirates will be the way college and high school baseball schedules change, if at all, in 2021.</p>
<p>“We don’t have perfect clarity on what a college baseball season is going to look like, what a high school baseball season is going to look like,” Cherington said. “I feel pretty confident that there will be places to see players. If it’s on campus at University of Florida or if it’s somewhere else, you know, I don’t know. Certainly hope it’s on campus. Hope we get to see a lot of games. We’ll adjust to that as necessary.”</p>
<p><strong>Fall instructional league</strong></p>
<p>While the draft will certainly be important in terms of acquiring talent, equally as important will be the development of the players the Pirates already have.</p>
<p>In a 2020 season without minor league baseball, that is tough to do for many of the Pirates’ youngest prospects. To get that development, though, the Pirates, along with other teams, have convened about 50 players at their spring training site in Bradenton, Fla., for fall instructional time.</p>
<p>Cherington said those players are already on the field and working, as they’ve tried to create a sort of “bubble” environment for them, with COVID-19 testing and protocols instituted to keep players and staff as safe as possible. Soon, those players will begin playing games against other organizations, hoping to get as many live at-bats and as much progress as possible out of this strange season.</p>
<p>“To state the obvious, it’s exciting that players are on the field,” Cherington said. “It’s really important for us. You know, we appreciate the support to do that. Not every team is doing it, and we are. That means a lot. And there’s going to be players who have a chance to get better during this six-week program in instructional league.</p>
<p>“It’s also just a great opportunity to connect with guys and make sure we’re in a good spot going into the offseason with some really important young players, and that we have a really good kind of clear picture of where they are going into the offseason ... whether that’s a new draft pick or an international player or someone that’s been in the organization. There’s a lot of benefit from it, and we’re grateful to be able to do it.”</p>
