<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: Do the Steelers have a new ‘bell cow' in Benny Snell?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lucius Allen and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Rick Wilson, @Ricktactoe:</strong> What is the Conner situation if his injury is short term following a strong Benny Snell performance?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Great question, Dr. Wilson. A week ago, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/09/08/mike-tomlin-steelers-running-game-james-conner-benny-snell/stories/202009080099" target="_blank">Mike Tomlin was adamant</a> that his team had a “bell cow” back in James Conner. Now what?</p>
<p>Conner’s miserable injury luck continued in the opener, when he injured an ankle in the first half. He has now missed 11 games and parts of several others in his first three seasons. In fact, he has left three of his past four starts (Giants, Jets, Browns) on account of injuries and did not seem healthy in the Buffalo game.</p>
<p>The Steelers keep saying they are “comfortable” with Conner, but professional sports teams say a lot of things. I couldn’t help but notice the Steelers did not sign him to a contract extension, so they can’t be overly comfortable.</p>
<p>And now Tomlin might have a decision on his hands. You phrased it well, Dr. Wilson: What if Conner is iffy, as he was down the stretch last season, seemingly for every game. What then?</p>
<p>For me, it’s easy: Snell has earned the No. 1 job, even if Conner is deemed healthy. Performance talks. Snell had a great game Monday night, in keeping with this theme: Whenever he is made the “bell cow,” he responds.</p>
<p>Consider: Snell has received 15 or more carries six times in his career. He has rushed for 481 yards on 107 carries in those games, good for 4.5 yards per tote. Also, his 30-yard run Monday matched the longest run of Conner’s career and was longer than any Conner run since October 2018.</p>
<p>If Conner is questionable, the Steelers should move ahead with Snell. It’s easier to prepare for games that way. The bigger news is that Snell is making himself a viable option even if Conner is healthy.</p>
<p>But that’s just me. Tomlin might have different ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby, @BuStA607:</strong> How worried should we be with the offensive line especially after the Banner injury?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Somewhat worried, Bobby, but I’m not sure there’s a huge drop-off from Banner to Chukwuma Okorafor. I’m not even sure there’s going to be a huge drop-off from Stefen Wisniewski to Kevin Dotson — should Dotson be forced to play — based on what appeared to be a slow start for Wisniewski.</p>
<p>The best hope, of course, is that David DeCastro is able to play ASAP. The worry now is depth at several positions. Remember, Wisniewski — and I’m not sure of his status — is the backup center, too.</p>
<p><strong>Dan A, @hypothermicyeti:</strong> Orange juice preference: No pulp, some pulp, or lots of pulp?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Not a big pulp guy, Dan, and thank you for asking. Although I love the movie “Pulp Fiction.” And that gets me to thinking:</p>
<p>Top 5 John Travolta movies:</p>
<p>5. “Saturday Night Fever”</p>
<p>4. “Carrie”</p>
<p>3. “Pulp Fiction”</p>
<p>2. “Blow Out” (the story of the Pirates’ 2020 season).</p>
<p>1. “Grease”</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan, @Jonatha25813729:</strong> Should Feiler move to RT if Banner is out the year?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> No, they have made the move with Feiler. No need to move him again. Let Chuks settle into the role.</p>
<p><strong>jasonS, @489jason:</strong> Best run defense in the league?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Yes, Jason, quite literally: The Steelers’ rank No. 1 after one week, having allowed just 29 yards to the Fighting Saquon Barkleys — who were wildly praised in the New York Post, by the way, even though they were losing 26-10 before a junk touchdown late.</p>
<p>Will it last? That’s an impossible question to answer, JasonS, but I feel comfortable in saying this: They will have a better run defense than last season, when they finished a middling 14th in the NFL, so long as the line stays healthy. Stephon Tuitt makes.a rather large difference, wouldn’t you say?</p>
<p>They’ll have some big-time challenges, too, between Derrick Henry, Ezekiel Elliott and a division loaded with talented runners.</p>
<p><strong>john coctossen, @JCoctossen:</strong> True/False: Terrell Edmunds is a weak link in this potentially elite defense.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong>&nbsp;Potentially, yes, Dr. Cocotossen, but he did lead the club in tackles Monday (that can be a good or bad thing) and helped hold the Giants’ tight ends in check. He’s an X factor on this defense this year. If he can take the giant leap I thought he’d take last year, the defense becomes that much better. He has struggled in coverage at times. He also has unbelievable closing speed.</p>
<p>I’m in wait-and-see mode on him.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Scar, @AnthScar:</strong> Is one game a good indication of how RBs are a dime a dozen and can be replaced at any time?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Many games are an indication of that, Dr. Scar. Many games. After the L.A. Rams cut Todd Gurley, <a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/news/1530737837371/joe-starkey-in-the-nfl-youre-crazy-to-spend-big-money-on-a-running-back" target="_blank">I wrote this piece</a>&nbsp;in which the main point was this:</p>
<p><em>“Running-back-by-committee works, and the harsh truth is that passable backs — guys you can win with — are a dime a dozen. They can be found anywhere. Of the past 12 Super Bowl champions, just three featured a 1,000-yard rusher — and one of them was LeGarrette Blount. Another was Ray Rice, and he wound up sharing time with Bernard Pierce that year. The only team of recent vintage to win it all with a star workhorse back was Seattle with Marshawn Lynch in 2013.</em></p>
<p><em>“Other than that, you see a James White here, a Corey Clement there, a Damien Williams here, a Ronnie Hillman there, a Mike Bell here, a Sony Michel there, a Brandon Jacobs here, a Brandon Jackson there. Blount was the leading rusher on consecutive Super Bowl winners, for goodness sake (2016 Patriots, ’17 Eagles). The San Francisco 49ers were practically pulling guys out of the stands this year, and it didn’t hurt their running game.”</em></p>
<p>Multiple teams have put big money in running backs since then.</p>
<p>We’ll see if they were smart.</p>
