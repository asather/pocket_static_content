<h1>One person shot during armed robbery near IUP</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Indiana police said two people were injured following an armed robbery near the Indiana University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Indiana Borough police responded to an armed robbery at 7:56 p.m in the 800 block of Wayne Ave, according to a release from police.</p>
<p>As police responded to that call, a second call came in reporting gunshots heard in the same area.</p>
<p>When police arrived, they found two injured people, one of whom was shot. Both victims have received medical attention, police said, but there is no update on their conditions.</p>
<p>The release from authorities described the suspects as&nbsp;“three males attempting to obstruct their identities.” An alert from IUP earlier in the evening said the suspects were three black men in ski masks. They are still at-large.</p>
<p>Police said they are processing two separate crime scenes, and believe this “was not a random incident,” though they “do not believe there is a current risk to community safety.”</p>
<p>When police first responded, the university released an advisory telling students to stay locked indoors. The shooting location is two blocks from IUP’s main campus.</p>
<p>The statement from police said the investigation is ongoing and “all residents are encouraged to remain vigilant and report suspicious activity.”</p>
<p><em>This story will be updated.</em></p>
