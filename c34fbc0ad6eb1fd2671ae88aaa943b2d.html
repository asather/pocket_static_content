<h1>Former employee pleads guilty to stealing $189,000 from Pittsburgh tech company</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Oakmont man pleaded guilty Tuesday on charges that he stole about $189,000 from a cybersecurity firm that he used to work for.</p>
<p>Andrew Wolniak, 32, pleaded guilty to theft, receiving stolen property and access device fraud in connection to money stolen from Qintel.</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint, Wolniak was a system administrator for the company from September 2013 until he was fired in August 2018, when it became clear he was fraudulently using a company credit card.</p>
<p>The firm issued credit cards to 35 of its employees, but Wolniak was not among them. The company’s CEO, William Schambura, did not trust him due to his “impulse buying,” the complaint reads.</p>
<p>In August 2018, Mr. Schambura noticed thousands of dollars in purchases made on Amazon. Upon investigating the matter, Mr. Schambura found nearly $136,000 in fraudulent purchases, the complaint says, some including car parts and accessories.</p>
<p>Wolniak owned a car-tuning company called SkeyyyTuning in Shaler.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The complaint also says he stole over two dozen iPhones from Qintel, some of which he sold on eBay under the username “skeyyytuning”; iPads, Apple TVs and laptops were also taken from the company’s inventory.</p>
<p>Wolniak bought items with stolen Qintel funds and sold them for more than $11,000, the complaint says.</p>
<p>Wolniak was sentenced by Judge Kevin Sasinoski to 18 months of intermediate punishment. The court will also set a probation. Wolniak was also ordered to pay full restitution for the company’s losses, $10,000 of which he paid as part of the plea.</p>
<p>He was also ordered to perform 100 hours of community service and to undergo a mental health evaluation, a spokesman for the District Attorney’s office said. Wolniak was also told to have no contact with Qintel or its employees.</p>
