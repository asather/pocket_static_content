<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — What are they going to do?</p>
<p>Not play baseball, obviously, but the news that came out Thursday — with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/03/12/Pirates-face-uncertainty-as-COVID-19-reaction-around-sports-intensifies/stories/202003120118" target="_blank">Major League Baseball shutting down</a> spring training and delaying Opening Day by at least two weeks — has many different layers, with plenty of questions left unanswered due to the fluidity of the situation.</p>
<p>Here, then, is a look at some of the most popular ones.</p>
<p><strong>Will players stay at spring training sites or go home?</strong></p>
<p>That much is up in the air. MLB and the MLBPA met Thursday night to discuss what might happen between now and whenever everything starts up again, and this is absolutely one of the biggest points of intrigue.</p>
<p>NHL players are expected to stay home; however, they actually are home ... or as close as they get in North America. Baseball players are not. It seems like a tough ask to delay the season and also prevent players from seeing their loved ones, at least the entire time.</p>
<p>Doing things this way also takes players out of a controlled environment. Had the Pirates stayed at LECOM Park, for example, they could have cleaned the place every night — twice if they really wanted to get crazy. Now, they can’t, potentially putting players at greater risk.</p>
<p>If they allow international players to travel home and, for whatever reason, a border ban would come into place, then things could get really ugly.</p>
<p>The only thing we know is that, while discussions between the two sides continue, spring training sites will be closed to the public/fans, media and family members/friends of players/staff.</p>
<p><strong>How do they practice or work out in the interim?</strong></p>
<p>Speaking after Thursday’s game, Pirates manager Derek Shelton acknowledged the obvious: Sure, the Pirates could have intrasquad games to keep their pitchers fresh and foster competition, but they’re still not the real thing.</p>
<p>Inevitably, baseball teams are bound to experience a drop in intensity as they transition from games back to practice time, especially if it’s optional.</p>
<p>“For our pitchers to execute pitches and for our hitters to have timing, I think the one thing that you concern yourself with there is the intensity not being the same as a spring training game,” Shelton said. “I think the one thing that we’ve done really well all spring training is the intensity that we’ve had.</p>
<p>“That would be something we would try to force to replicate as much as possible depending on what happens.”</p>
<p>Building off of that, there’s a real concern with pitchers and the buildup necessary toward a 162-game season — or, in this case, as close as baseball could come to a full regular season.</p>
<p>This time, through the rotation, starters would’ve been looking to throw around six innings or 100 pitches — which is basically a regular start. Joe Musgrove said one of the things the Pirates must decide is whether it makes more sense to continue down that path or start throwing less, ramping back up when baseball returns.</p>
<p>“You have to take advantage of the time,” Musgrove said. “It’s the reality of what’s happening. You have to face it head on and make the most of it. A couple extra weeks to work with the new staff and get with [pitching coach] Oscar [Marin] more and dive into some more things that we might not have had time to do this spring, that’s what we’re going to do — take advantage of the time we have and stay sharp. It’s going to be hard, though.”</p>
<p><strong>From a business perspective, there are plenty of questions left unanswered</strong></p>
<p>It stands to reason that the Pirates will lose out on the revenue generated from the six remaining home spring training games at LECOM Park.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those who bought tickets likely want compensated in some way, while those working the games will be without money they expected to make.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, even if the season is delayed by the minimum two weeks, there would be a loss of six-seven home games, presenting the same sort of problems when it came to tickets bought and money (not) made by PNC Park staff.</p>
<p>Other teams, most notably the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, are working on programs to keep those workers employed through the stoppage, as owner Mark Cuban — a Mt. Lebanon native — said he plans on keeping the paychecks coming, with the ask that those employees maybe do some volunteer work instead.</p>
<p>Neither owner Bob Nutting nor president Travis Williams talked on Thursday after MLB made its announcement, but it’s surely an issue that will need addressed in the coming days.</p>
<p><strong>What does MLB do with the missed games?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly two weeks from Opening Day would mean the Pirates open April 9 at home against the Cubs — the finale of a four-game series. That would be a little strange, having clubs play one game before potentially starting a weekend series in another city (as the Pirates would the next day in Baltimore).</p>
<p>If MLB restarted its season on Friday, April 10, that would equate to 13 lost games for the Pirates, seven at home. Does it make more sense to punt on those games and simply play a shortened schedule, or does MLB — again, assuming the best-case scenario here — try to play those games at the end?</p>
<p>It would be incredibly difficult to tack them on to existing series or play that many doubleheaders, especially when the Pirates’ first series involves interleague play with the Tampa Bay Rays.</p>
<p><strong>What happens with scouts, specifically ones who have been working outside of the United States?</strong></p>
<p>Baseball teams have scouts stationed all over the world, and some clubs have brought those men and women home, theoretically lessening the risk of exposure to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The lost work is one thing — and relatively minor at that — but they’ve also likely encountered varying degrees of risk and could very easily have been in situations where they’re more likely to have contracted COVID-19.</p>
<p>Any sane person would hope nobody was affected, but if the past week has shown us anything, it’s that nobody is immune, even if you’re Tom Hanks.</p>
<p><strong>What if this requires more than a two-week loss in regular season games?</strong></p>
<p>Completely real possibility, right? NBA commissioner Adam Silver said his league’s hiatus will be “at least 30 days.” If MLB follows suit and its clubs can’t do anything for a full month, there’s no way games would start on April 9-10.</p>
<p>In that scenario, MLB would almost have to be OK playing a shortened season, which would obviously skew some statistics and alter competitive balance, even if it’s not by much.</p>
<p>That pales in comparison to keeping everyone safe, but it’s absolutely something baseball must consider.</p>
