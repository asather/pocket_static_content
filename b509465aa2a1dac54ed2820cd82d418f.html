<h1>Pitt RB V'Lique Carter enters the transfer portal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt running back V’Lique Carter has entered the transfer portal, a source told the Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>Carter, who’s entering his junior season, will need to sit out the 2020 campaign if he transfers to another Football Bowl Subdivision program, unless he’s granted a waiver by the NCAA.</p>
<p>A Pitt running back pursuing other options should not come as a huge surprise.</p>
<p>Andre Powell’s room is crowded entering winter workouts and spring camp, with rising senior A.J. Davis, redshirt junior Todd Sibley and sophomores Vincent Davis and Daniel Carter returning. Israel Abanikanda — a 2020 three-star prospect, per Rivals — has also signed and entered the fold as an early enrollee.</p>
<p>Still, Carter, a three-star defensive back in Pitt’s 2018 recruiting class, made his mark as a versatile piece of the Panthers’ offense.</p>
<p>The Florida native switched from defense midway through his true freshman season and dusted Duke for 137 rushing yards and two touchdowns in a 54-45 win. That was Carter's only expansive look at carries in 2018, but it offered hope for what was believed to be ahead.</p>
<p>Listed on Pitt's 2019 preseason depth chart as a running back/wide receiver, the Florida native played exclusively the former last season. But the 5-9, 185-pounder served as a real passing option out of the backfield. Carter recorded 17 receptions for 183 yards, including a game-winning, 26-yard catch-and-run at Duke on Oct. 5.</p>
<p>Carter also had a role in Pitt's (largely disappointing) 2019 rushing attack. He logged 65 carries and 243 yards, ranking third and fourth on the team, respectively.</p>
<p>Carter's versatility could have again been utilized in 2020, but how much would have been the question.</p>
<p>Davis, a speedy 5-8 rusher, offers a similar skillset and emerged as the 2019 season progressed. The 170-pounder popped a 61-yard score at Georgia Tech on Nov. 2, ripped off a 39-yard rush versus Boston College in the regular-season finale and tallied 96 yards on 17 touches (15 carries, two catches) in Pitt's Quick Lane Bowl win.</p>
<p>In addition to Vincent Davis, Sibley and A.J. Davis remain options. Abanikanda expects to push for playing time immediately, as well.</p>
