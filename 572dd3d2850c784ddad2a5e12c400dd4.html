<h1>Art Rooney II: Steelers still have work left to get under cap</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers president Art Rooney II said his team is done releasing players for now, but a few more contracts have to be restructured in order to be in compliance with the salary cap by 4 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Steelers have already shaved approximately $35 million off the salary cap by restructuring five contracts, releasing three players and with the retirement of guard Ramon Foster.</p>
<p>While the Steelers are not yet under the cap of $198.2 million, Rooney said they will be in compliance by Wednesday and could still be position to sign outside players in free agency.</p>
<p>“I think we have one or two more things to fall into place,” Rooney said Tuesday in an interview with the Post-Gazette. “There will be another move or two that we’ll have to talk about in the next 24 hours.”</p>
<p>One of the ways the Steelers could do that is by signing defensive end Cam Heyward to a contract extension that would lessen his cap hit of $13,251,250 in 2020. But any deal with Heyward is not expected to come until after Wednesday. They could also restructure the deals of high-priced veterans David DeCastro, Maurkice Pouncey and Stephon Tuitt.</p>
<p>So far, the Steelers have converted the 2020 base salaries of five players — Ben Roethlisberger, Vance McDonald, Joe Haden, Steven Nelson and Chris Boswell — into signing bonuses, pushing their cap money into future seasons.</p>
<p>“We expect we will be there,” Rooney said. “I think we’ll be fine by the required time.”</p>
<p>With the loss of Foster and departure of nose tackle Javon Hargrave, who signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, the Steelers could be in position to sign an offensive lineman and/or defensive lineman in free agency. Restructuring McDonald’s contract is a sign they are not interested in a top-tier tight end in free agency.</p>
<p>“Obviously we have our own players we’re still interested in,” Rooney said. “We’ll be looking at a combination that if we can’t sign one of our players, then we’ll look outside. But I do think we’ll be in position to sign a few players, whether they’re ours or coming from another team.”</p>
<p>Rooney, though, said the Steelers accomplished their No. 1 goal of the offseason — franchise tagging outside linebacker Bud Dupree — even though it came at the expense of losing Hargrave and having to cut inside linebacker Mark Barron.</p>
<p>“We’re glad we were able to do that,” Rooney said. “That was an important piece of the puzzle — keep Bud in the fold and keep that defense together as much as we can. That was our Number 1 priority.</p>
<p>“Every year you have to make decisions like that. We would’ve loved to keep Javon, but with the contracts we have with Cam and Tuitt, Javon would have been almost a luxury. Not many teams are paying three guys at that level on a defensive line. It’s disappointing we lost him but, under the circumstances, not unexpected.”</p>
