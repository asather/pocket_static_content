<h1>Busy time for Kraft Heinz: A new Super Bowl ad and a new U.S. leader</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Your Steelers won’t be playing in this year’s Super Bowl extravaganza, but Kraft Heinz is buying its way into the big game again.</p>
<p>The food giant, with bases in both Steelers and Chicago Bears territory, announced Wednesday that it plans to fork over the money needed to put a new ketchup offering in front of viewers watching the game airing on Fox on Feb. 2.</p>
<p>The Heinz brand, and its flagship ketchup, will be featured in the 30-second commercial in the second quarter, with a brief appearance by Heinz HoneyRacha, another in the flavored condiment experiments that have been coming from Kraft Heinz.</p>
<p>The company doesn’t plan to pre-release the ad, which is being created by ad agency Wieden+Kennedy and directed by Roman Coppola, according to the Kraft Heinz announcement.</p>
<p>Trade publication AdAge estimated 30 seconds of time during the live event, which draws massive viewership every year, will cost more than $5 million.&nbsp;The Super Bowl is one of the rare occasions when audiences are (almost) as interested in the marketing efforts as in the actual televised event.</p>
<p>Kraft Heinz, which has a huge portfolio of well-known food lines sold in the nation’s grocery stores, has been to the big game before.</p>
<p>Last year, the company aired commercials promoting Planters nuts and its Devour frozen food line. In 2016, a mass of dachshunds dressed as hot dogs ran toward people dressed as bottles of condiments in what was called the “Weiner Stampede.” And in 2014, Heinz ketchup was featured in an ad.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz, which was formed from the merger of Pittsburgh’s H.J. Heinz Co. and Illinois-based Kraft Foods Group, has struggled in the last couple of years to find new ways to grow sales and please shareholders.</p>
<p>Like adding&nbsp;HoneyRacha to the shelves — which it plans to do in the next few months — the company has&nbsp;been working to shake up its image with other products such as the mayonnaise/ketchup mashup called Mayochup and a reformulated macaroni and cheese meant to be healthier.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, the company named a new president for its U.S. operations.</p>
<p>The day after the Super Bowl, Carlos Abrams-Rivera will take over leadership of all U.S. business operations, the company’s largest business.</p>
<p>CEO Miguel Patricio, who took the chief executive post in July, had also been handling the U.S. role.</p>
<p>A native of Puerto Rico, Mr. Abrams-Rivera, 52, has previously worked at companies such as Campbell Soup Co. and Kraft Foods.</p>
