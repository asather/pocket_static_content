<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Phased reopening plans for limited in-person services have started at various locations of Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Five locations — Allegheny, Brookline, East Liberty, Hill District and Oakland — began reopening Tuesday with limited in-person services.</p>
<p>The Beechview, Hazelwood, Homewood, Knoxville and Squirrel Hill locations will reopen for in-person services Aug. 25.</p>
<p>The following week, on Sept. 1, the Carrick, Lawrenceville, Sheraden, South Side, West End and Woods Run locations will be opened.</p>
<p>Visitors will now be able to use the computers, print documents, pick up books, place holds and apply for a library card in person.</p>
<p>Use of the computers and indoor WiFi is limited to a maximum of 30 minutes. Book browsing is currently not allowed in person, but the libraries have a book catalog on their website where visitors can browse before picking up in person.</p>
<p>The hours for the opening libraries will be Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Curbside services, which include remote printing and document pick up and material pick ups or returns, will still be available at all locations during the same hours.</p>
