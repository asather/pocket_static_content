<h1>Pirates sign fifth-round draft pick Logan Hofmann</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates announced the signing of fifth-round draft selection Logan Hofmann on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hofmann, a right-handed pitcher out of Northwestern State in Louisiana, is now the second of the Pirates six draft picks that has signed his name on the dotted line, following just a couple of days after first-round pick Nick Gonzales signed his own contract.</p>
<p>A second-team All-American in 2020, according to Collegiate Baseball, Hofmann began his college career at Colby Community College in Kansas, where he set the conference record for career strikeouts and was a third-team All-American in 2019.</p>
<p>When he was drafted at 138th overall, Hofmann, a Canadian native, became the highest-drafted player to ever come out of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>“We are excited to add Logan to the Pirates organization,” said Pirates General Manager Ben&nbsp;Cherington in a press release. “Logan has performed well at every level of amateur baseball and has a strong combination&nbsp;of stuff, control, feel for pitching and competitiveness. We look forward to seeing Logan in a Pirates&nbsp;uniform.”</p>
