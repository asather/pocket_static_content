<h1>Pitt continues to struggle, loses to Virginia Tech</h1>

<p>BLACKSBURG, Va. -- An opportunity awaited Pitt Saturday night at an old barn of a gym tucked away in the mountains of southwestern Virginia.</p>
<p>The Panthers, for all of their struggles on the road, were presented with an opponent in Virginia Tech which had lost its past five games, four of which came against teams that came into the weekend with non-winning records. More than anything else, given the timing of the game and the trajectory of its opponent’s season, it was a chance to move on and start anew following a 20-point loss three days earlier against Clemson, very likely their most unsightly setback of the season.</p>
<p>Instead, what transpired Saturday against the Hokies was more of the same. Yet again, Pitt stumbled its way to double-digit deficit in the first half and, despite a spirited comeback, was unable to recover from those early missteps, falling to the Hokies, 67-57, at Cassell Coliseum.</p>
<p>“We can’t dig ourselves a hole like we did again,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “Again, we showed we can get up off the mat and fight back, but we have to figure out a way where we don’t have a hole that big.”</p>
<p>It was the Panthers’ second consecutive loss and fifth in their past seven games after a 13-6 start to the season, though a majority of those wins came against weaker, non-conference competition.</p>
<p>This most recent one played out as so many of its other predecessors on the road have, giving them a sense of deja vu they would try anything to avoid.</p>
<p>Pitt shot just 26.9% in the first half, missing 19 of its 26 field goal attempts, and scored only 23 points on 34 possessions (0.68 points per possession). It continued what has been a maddening and perplexing trend on the road this season. In their past six road games, they haven’t shot better than 37.9% in the first half, finishing below 30% in three of those instances.</p>
<p>Surely enough, in the second half, it was a different story entirely, one featuring a team that was unrecognizable from the one that had left the court minutes earlier. In the final 20 minutes, the Panthers (15-11, 6-9 ACC) shot 41.2% and rattled off 35 points on 31 possessions (1.13 points per possession).</p>
<p>“I feel like we can push through adversity,” said forward Au’Diese Toney, who had a team-high 12 points and four steals. “It’s just at times we just get too relaxed. When we get too relaxed, it’s too hard to bounce back from a 14-point lead. It’s very hard, definitely in the ACC.”</p>
<p>Virginia Tech’s half-to-half splits weren’t nearly as drastic -- if anything, it was better, as well, making seven of its 14 3-pointers in the second half after making just five of its 18 in the first -- but Pitt’s offensive awakening was enough to turn a game once teetering toward a blowout into something significantly more tense and competitive.</p>
<p>After trailing by nine at halftime, the Panthers saw their deficit grow after a 12-2 run put the Hokies up by 19 with 16:28 remaining. Four minutes later, Virginia Tech still held that advantage, but from there, it began to gradually dwindle, with Pitt scoring seemingly every possession it had. Behind 11 second-half points from Xavier Johnson, the Panthers were within six, 59-53, following a layup from freshman Abdoul Karim Coulibaly with 3:21 remaining, turning what had been a buzzing building into something more tame.</p>
<p>It was then, though, that a pair of decisive blows were dealt. With their lead down to two possessions, the Hokies got a 3 from P.J. Horne. After another Coulibaly layup on the ensuing possession, Virginia Tech again responded, getting another 3 from Horne from virtually the identical spot in front of his team’s bench, pushing its lead to 10 with 2:40 left to play and ending most realistic hopes for a comeback.</p>
<p>“We played against a team that was rested, that was hungry,” Capel said. “They lost five in a row, so you could feel the sense or urgency. There was incredible energy in the building.”</p>
<p>In many ways, Horne’s 3s and those late possessions told the story of the night. Pitt, for all of its miscues, had found a way to get back in a game it once looked like it would lose decisively, only to have whatever hope it had generated get slashed with a single flick of the wrist. It had climbed so far, but the mountain it had created to scale was simply too towering, too treacherous.</p>
<p>It was made that way, in part, because of mistakes in some of the game’s simpler facets. In the first half, as they fell behind by nine, the Panthers missed six layups. For the game, they went just 10 of 18 from the free-throw line after shooting 72.1% on such shots in its first 25 games. Those lost points, even in a game decided by double digits, raise painful hypotheticals about how the contest may have unfolded differently and how a loss, just maybe, might have been a sorely needed win.</p>
<p>The setback also poses questions about what this team is at this point in the season. A group that looked fatigued in the first half -- and whose coach said it looked tired in the loss to Clemson earlier in the week -- managed to summon enough energy as the game wore on and their bodies grew more exhausted to get back into a game on the road.</p>
<p>Pitt hasn’t had more than four days off between games since early January and with injuries to guards Ryan Murphy and Onyebuchi Ezeakudo, its four most-used players -- Justin Champagnie, Johnson, Trey McGowens and Toney -- had each averaged at least 36 minutes per game over the past four games. They’re young men who are finely trained athletes, but that time takes a toll. The Panthers have altered their schedule and routine, too. After playing at 9 p.m. Wednesday against Clemson, they didn’t do much in practice Thursday and on Friday, with a game the following day and travel awaiting them later in the afternoon, Capel only wanted to push them so hard physically.</p>
<p>“There’s not much we can do,” Capel said. “We try to be smart because we want to try to conserve energy for the games. But this is the grind part of the season and we have to figure it out.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, an injury plagued team that hasn’t had an extended break for nearly two months faced an opponent who hadn’t played for a week. Over 40 minutes, and particularly in the first 20, both teams accurately reflected their circumstances.</p>
<p>“It’s hard because, like you said, you want to do things but your legs, it’s not good, [not] healthy,” Toney said. “Tired. You can’t do too much, but…”</p>
<p>The sophomore forward’s thought trailed off and he shrugged. That quick and simple motion showed the predicament in which his team finds itself after Saturday -- looking for answers that aren’t particularly easy to come by.</p>
