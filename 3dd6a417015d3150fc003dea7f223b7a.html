<h1>Pittsburgh musicians remember punk innovator, Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The electric guitar was invented in 1932, so by 1979 most things you could do on it had already been done.</p>
<p>And along came Andy Gill.</p>
<p>The guitarist for Gang of Four, who died Saturday at 64 of a respiratory illness, didn’t approach the instrument like anyone before him. It was as if he came from another dimension, saw it lying there and picked it up to wield as a weapon. He boosted the gain, scratched and scraped percussively at the strings.</p>
<p>It was perhaps the most abrasive and beautiful sound punk ever gave us.</p>
<p>“He had a unique way of making a guitar sound like it was being strangled, and I mean that as a compliment,” says Pittsburgh saxophonist Ben Opie.</p>
<p>Gang of Four’s debut album “Entertainment!,” dropping in 1979, hit the punk world like a hammer -- and sickle, given the band’s raging Marxist politics.</p>
<p>Brooke Duer, a Pittsburgh musician who would play in Stick Against Stone and The Core, among other bands, remembers hearing Gang of Four on WYEP in 1979.</p>
<p>“ ‘At Home He Feels Like A Tourist’ started and when Andy Gill hit those first jagged chords bouncing off the smooth rhythm track my ear (musically) changed overnight. This was the stuff -- a truly new form of rock n' roll, not based on blues and testosterone, but based on smarts and mechanization of rhythm. Funky parts played by unfunky people, aggressively and loud. Every aspiring band member in Pittsburgh at the time instantly learned how to piece together songs in their practice space. Andy Gill and the Gang of Four established the vocabulary. All you had to do was rearrange the parts. It was the perfect fit for those who thought of music as part of ‘art’ in general and couldn't, or weren't ever going to, play a Chuck Berry tune.”</p>

<p>If the record was amazing, the live experience took it up a dozen notches. Pittsburgh got its first taste in 1982 when Gang of Four had people bouncing off each other and off the walls of Carnegie Mellon University's Skibo Ballroom. Gill’s dead stare added a whole new menace to his playing while frontman John King seemed like he was just let out of a cage. It made The Clash seem almost quaint.</p>
<p>The band would return in those early years to play the Syria Mosque and Stanley Theater. (On a personal note, one of the first music stories I ever wrote was about Gang of Four, for The Pitt News, in 1983, having interviewed them backstage at the Syria Mosque. The friendlier Jon King did most of the talking.)</p>
<p>“He completely rewired me,” says Charlie Humphrey, who along with his work at In Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Filmmakers played in The Shanks. “I saw Gang of Four at the Stanley Theater in, I dunno, 1983? It was the best rock concert of my life, and I’m 61. He found new angles and vectors and punctuation marks I had never dreamed of. It wasn’t a new language, but it was novel grammar.”</p>
<p>Tom Moran, who was on the ground floor of Pittsburgh punk with avant-punk band The Five, says Gill was a “huge influence” on his playing. “When we opened for them at The Stanley, he kindly told me some tricks about feedback, which was both of our stock in trade.”</p>
<p>Asked last year how the sound of “Entertainment!” turned out as raw as it did, Gill offered this insight.</p>
<p>“It didn't just pop out,” he told me. “It was very, very carefully considered. I would tell Dave [Allen] what I thought he should play and, by and large, he would play it. And I would tell Hugo [Burnham] what I thought he should play, and we'd have a fight. Basically, his point of view was, 'What do you know?' And it was like, 'That's a fair enough question, but I've got a plan and you don't, so let's go with my plan.' Every beat was carefully thought through. The placing of every open hi hat, closed hi hat, snare beat.</p>
<p>“I think it was partly luck that the drum sound from 'Entertainment!' was quite a dry sound, but I think it was a good thing because it gave more sharpness and clarity to the song, to the rhythm. Nothing was very affected. The studio we were in was quite basic, and it didn't really have any effects or delays or reverbs and stuff, so our hands were tied to a certain extent, which is probably beneficial.”</p>
<p>With subsequent albums, Gang of Four would go on to become a more polished dance-punk band laying the groundwork for the likes of LCD Soundsystem and even the Red Hot Chili Peppers with songs like “I Love a Man in a Uniform.”</p>
<p>Gill produced the first Chili Peppers album in 1984. In an Instagram post on Sunday, RHCP bassist Flea wrote of “Entertainment!,” “That’s a record that changed my life forever, and was massively influential on my development as a musician, and showed me what a rock band could be. There is nothing else like it. It cut a [expletive] hole right the thick LA smog that I wanted to jump through.”</p>
<p>Like most punk bands, Gang of Four struggled to maintain that intensity for very long. The band split in ’83 and then Gill and King regrouped for two albums in the ’90s that no one is in a hurry to dig out. The original band tapped into the early fury one last time during a full reunion tour that played Mr. Smalls in 2005. In recent years, following 2011’s “Content,” Gill became the lone member carrying the band name.</p>
<p>“I finally had the privilege last year of working with him and he was as ornery and abrasive in his personality and his weapon of choice as I could have hoped,” Bengt Alexander of Pittsburgh band Action Camp posted on Facebook, referring to him running sound at Mr. Smalls. “People complained cause they didn’t get that was the point, and I wouldn’t have wanted to see him go down any other way.”</p>
<p>The fact that Gang of Four was never even nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame diminishes the integrity of that institution.</p>
