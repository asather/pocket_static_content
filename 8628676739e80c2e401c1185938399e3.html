<h1>Pet Tales: Tips from experts on how to cope with a pet's death</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When a beloved pet dies, what do you do with the collar, leash, food dishes, bed and toys?</p>
<p>Keep those things to celebrate a pet’s life, says&nbsp;Joelle Nielsen, a veterinary social worker at Ohio State University. The university’s Wexner Medical Center VetMed department is one of the few programs in the country that has a full-time veterinary social worker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Nielsen, who has a master’s degree in social work, helps pet owners at the Columbus hospital&nbsp;deal with life-threatening and life-ending issues and illnesses.</p>
<p>She also suggests holding a memorial service, creating a scrapbook or collage and donating money or volunteer hours — in your pet’s honor — to a shelter, rescue or veterinary medical center.

<p>Dog trainer Penny Layne of Manor, Westmoreland County, suggests&nbsp;displaying dog bowls and other items on a&nbsp;“memorial table.” She and her husband, Shawn Murtha, recently completed training so that they can lead pet loss support sessions.</p>
<p>Their first Pet Loss Support Group meeting is set for 4 p.m. Saturday at American Legion Post 331, 216 Cavitt Ave., Trafford (15085).&nbsp;Future sessions will be held at the Sweet Buzz Bean &amp; Bistro, 3353 Route 130, Harrison City (15636) from 7 to 8:30 p.m. March 15 and 29; April 12, 20 and 26; and May 4 and 18.</p>
<p>The number of professional veterinary social workers who focus on pet owners is rather small, but interest in the field is growing.&nbsp;Ms. Nielsen heads OSU’s Honor the Bond program, referring to the bond between people and their pets. Her duties&nbsp;include being with people and their pets before and during the euthanasia process.</p>
<p>Ms. Nielsen has developed and is coordinating operation of the Hospital-Based Veterinary Social Work group in the U.S. and Canada. The new organization is hoping to help veterinary centers expand social support services to more pet owners.</p>
<p>She notes that veterinary social workers are employed at Pittsburgh Veterinary &amp; Emergency Center-North Hills, which is now owned and operated by Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners.</p>
<p>The facility in Ohio Township has two veterinary social workers. Its Pet Loss &amp; Grief Support Group meets the second Saturday of each month. Sessions are free but reservations are required at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:socialwork@bluepearlvet.com" target="_blank">socialwork@bluepearlvet.com</a>.&nbsp;Its Social Work Support Line is 412-348-6515.</p>
<p>Ms. Layne,who operates Aunt Penny’s Pet Services, last summer started the Pet Prayer Blankets group, mobilizing volunteers who have made more than 1,600 no-sew fleece blankets for ailing and dying pets.</p>
<p>“We decided we needed to do more,” Ms. Layne said.</p>
<p>In February, she and Mr. Murtha flew to Florida for a weekend of training at the Two Hearts Pet Loss Center. They’ll be leading free group sessions, giving grieving pet owners the chance to&nbsp;“release emotions and go forward,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advice includes looking for a support group, which is what Ms. Layne and Mr. Murtha are offering. Go to the <a href="https://petprayerblankets.com/pet-loss-support-group/" target="_blank">petprayerblankets.com</a> and click on the&nbsp;“pet loss” tab to sign up for a meeting.</p>
