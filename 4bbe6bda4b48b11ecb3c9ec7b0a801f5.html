<h1>Wheeling Hospital to pay $50 million to settle DOJ kickback allegations for doctors</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Wheeling Hospital will pay $50 million to the U.S. to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by submitting claims to Medicare that resulted in violations of federal kickback laws, the Justice Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Physician Self-Referral Law prohibits hospitals from billing Medicare for certain services referred by physicians with whom the hospital has a financial relationship. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits paying remuneration to induce the referral of services covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal programs.</p>
<p>Both laws are intended to ensure that medical decisions are not compromised by improper financial incentives.</p>
<p>The U.S. alleged that from 2007 to 2020, under the direction of Pittsburgh-based R&amp;V Associates and Ronald Violi of O'Hara, Wheeling Hospital violated both laws by paying improper compensation to referring doctors that was based on the volume or value of the doctors' referrals or was above fair market value.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorneys in Pittsburgh and Northern West Virginia praised the settlement.</p>
<p>"Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries trust that their healthcare providers will made decisions based on sound medical judgment," U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said in a statement. "Our office will take decisive action against any medical providers which betray that trust and make medical decisions based on their own financial interests.</p>
<p>The settlement stems from a whistleblower complaint filed in 2017 by Louis Longo, a former executive vice president of Wheeling Hospital under the False Claims Act, which permits private citizens to bring lawsuits on behalf of the government and share in the proceeds. The law also allows the government to intervene, as it did in this case. Mr. Longo will receive $10 million of the settlement money.</p>
<p>DOJ announced last year that it had taken over the suit.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, the hospital under the direction of Mr. Violi, former CEO of Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh, entered into unlawful financial arrangements with doctors strictly to generate more revenue.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, the hospital was suffering financially, having lost more than $55 million from 1998 to 2005.</p>
<p>In 2006, Wheeling entered into a management contract with R&amp;V, based on Grant Street, to improve its financial performance.</p>
<p>Within five years, according to the suit, the hospital made a profit of nearly $90 million. The hospital paid R&amp;V and Mr. Violi millions for their services, the suit says.</p>
<p>R&amp;V's approach was to hire a large number of doctors to capture their patient referrals and dominate the Ohio Valley market. According to the complaint, they accomplished that by paying the doctors what amount to kickbacks.</p>
<p>The suit says that Mr. Violi and R&amp;V were focused heavily on revenue in discussions regarding compensation for doctors.</p>
<p>In one 2008 memo regarding pay for surgeon Ahmad Rahbar, for example, hospital CFO Jim Murdy wrote "we should keep in mind that Rahbar is a man we need to keep happy. In FY07 he generated over $11 million in revenues for us," according to the complaint.</p>
<p>In a 2012 memo, COO Scott McKeets wrote with respect to reducing pay for a doctor, gynecologist Chandra Swamy, "I would not recommend doing so anyway as we would not want to endanger the significant downstream revenue that she produces for Wheeling Hospital," the complaint says.</p>
<p>The suit cites numerous other examples.</p>
<p>"As a result, since at least 2007, defendants knowingly submitted and caused to be submitted thousands of false claims to the United States, which resulted in millions of dollars of reimbursement to Wheeling Hospital by the Medicare program for claims that were ineligible for payment because of Defendants’ unlawful conduct," the suit says.</p>
<p>The law requires that compensation paid to doctors by hospitals excludes the "volume and value" of patient referrals by those doctors. The idea is to make sure doctors provide treatment based on patient need rather than profit.</p>
<p>But the complaint says the hospital's goal was to gain "monopolistic power" in the Ohio Valley, with some doctors paid more than $1 million a year.</p>
<p>“The settlement was in the best interest of the long-term viability of the hospital and the&nbsp;community,” said Wheeling Hospital CEO Douglass Harrison in a statement. “Prolonging the lawsuit would have&nbsp;paralyzed the ability of the hospital to attract the best physicians and to make the necessary&nbsp;capital improvements to ensure that the highest quality health care continues to be provided in&nbsp;the Upper Ohio Valley.”</p>
