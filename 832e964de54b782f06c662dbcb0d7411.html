<h1>Peduto declares Juneteenth as official holiday in Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two months after the end of the Civil War, and two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, slaves in Texas were finally notified that they were free. It was June 19, 1865, and the original Juneteenth was born.</p>
<p>On Saturday, two months after Gov. Tom Wolf declared Juneteenth to be a state holiday, and 100 years after U.S. women won the right to vote, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto announced at a Black women’s voting rights event that Juneteenth will become an official Pittsburgh holiday in 2021.</p>
<p>“We think of voting rights in the context of our lives,” he said, speaking under the ornate steeple of St. Benedict the Moor Church in the Hill District. “Voter suppression: It’s not something your grandparents said was a part of Jim Crow. It is happening today. … June 19 will forever be a holiday in the City of Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto briefly shared the microphone with Theresa Kail-Smith, Pittsburgh City Council president, at the 2020 Jubilee Parade Memorial Service and Black Voting Rights Forum held in the grand Catholic church overlooking the Downtown side of The Hill. A prediction of rain that never fell forced the cancellation of the months-delayed Juneteenth parade, and the voting forum scheduled for Market Square was moved inside the historic church, built 24 years after the 15th Amendment gave Black citizens the right to vote, and 26 years before the 19th Amendment guaranteed suffrage for American women.</p>
<p>Event organizer William Marshall said it is important to remind Black citizens of sacrifices made to insure their voting rights.</p>
<p>“Black people have been killed, have been lynched, have been denied, have been suppressed in the right to vote since 1870,” he said. “... They still —&nbsp;white or racist people —&nbsp;still denied Black people the vote. It was up until 1965 that Congress had to pass the Voting Rights Act. … People are still being denied the right to vote, they’re being suppressed or voting is being taken away from us even up until this day.”</p>
<p>Mr. Marshall said he believes Black voter suppression is more than an electoral glitch caused by racist individuals..</p>
<p>“It’s institutional. We know that the Republican Party feels that if more people vote they will have a less likely chance of winning in the next election,” he said. “So they don't want people to vote. It’s [not] specifically just Blacks. They don't want seniors to vote, they don’t want youths to vote. They don't want college students to vote.”</p>
<p>Republicans routinely insist that their legal and rhetorical efforts —&nbsp;from suing to delegitimize the use of ballot drop boxes to casting doubt on the safety of mail-in voting as a whole —&nbsp;are intended to make voting more secure, not less accessible.</p>
<p>Women, too, said Mr. Marshall, should be reminded of the historical costs of suffrage.</p>
<p>“Particularly Black women. You have had to struggle to get the right to vote,” he said. “This [event] is angled toward Black women specifically because when they enacted the 19th Amendment in 1920, Black women couldn’t vote. They were still being suppressed from the vote.”</p>
<p>A long list of forum speakers shared those views including Samaria Rice, mother of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Black youth who pointed a toy gun at Cleveland police and was shot to death in 2014.</p>
<p>“Tamir would have been 18 this year, so I think it’s important to be here speaking about the importance of voting,” said Ms. Rice a few minutes before her speech. “When the system is broken like it is, and designed to be broken, Black and Brown people are not treated the same [as others]. It’s not working out for any of us. I just want people to do their homework and think carefully about the choices they’re making when it comes in November.”</p>
<p>Ms. Rice said she hopes to increase her influence among members of Congress.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh social activist Tim Stevens introduced speakers including Betty Pickett and Samuel Black, who spoke about the history of St. Benedict’s and the 15th and 19th amendments. Civil rights attorney Martha Conley, the first Black woman to graduate from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, spoke about Black women’s voting history.</p>
