<h1>Paul Zeise: Could the stars really align for Pitt football in 2020?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I had to laugh the other day when, during my weekly chat on post-gazette.com, a Pitt fan said he has no doubt the college football season will be canceled, his reason being that the 2020 team is supposed to be Pitt’s best in a long time and Panthers fans aren’t allowed to have nice things.</p>
<p>Obviously nobody knows for sure if there is going to be a college football season or not, but for Pitt’s sake, let’s hope there is.&nbsp;Panthers fans have waited way too long and suffered way too much over the past decade not to have the chance to watch this 2020 team. It seems primed to have the kind of breakout season Panthers fans have been waiting so long to witness.</p>
<p>The 2008 team won nine games. The 2009 team won 10 games. Both had excellent seasons, but both also left something to be desired and had Pitt fans wanting for more in so many ways. In 2008, they lost to Bowling Green and then managed to give up only three points but lose the Sun Bowl. The 2009 team, well, let me just write two words: Mardy Gilyard.</p>
<p>The next year, they went 8-5, but they were a kickoff return for a touchdown against Connecticut away from winning the Big East championship. That three-year stretch was the closest Pitt has been to becoming a perennial Top 25 team since the early 1980s.</p>
<p>That 2009 season is the Panthers only double-digit win season since 1982. It was downhill after that, and Pat Narduzzi arrived on the scene in 2015 and has been building a program ever since. He has had a few signature wins over top-five teams and has won a Coastal Division championship, but he now has a chance to elevate the program to the next level.</p>
<p>Pitt’s “next level” is often debated. I have often felt Pitt could be a perennial Top 25 team. I don’t know if perennial Top 10 is possible for a lot of reasons, but I do think the Panthers can be a team that wins nine-plus games almost annually and challenges for the ACC Coastal Division title more often than not.&nbsp;This year’s team could give them a glimpse of what that&nbsp;“next level” could look like.</p>
<p>The Panthers have what appears to be an excellent defense. They have one of the best safety tandems in the country, excellent corners and maybe the best defensive line of any team that isn’t in the SEC.</p>
<p>They have an experienced quarterback, an experienced line and plenty of skill position players. And Kenny Pickett, the quarterback, has worked with offensive coordinator Mark Whipple for an entire season now. That isn’t something that should be overlooked.</p>
<p>Next year’s recruiting class is already shaping up to be an excellent one too. And the Panthers also have&nbsp;an easier non-conference schedule than years past, and most teams in the Coastal Division are in some state of roster transition.</p>
<p>It’s all set up for Pitt this year. Now they just have to go out and win.</p>
