<h1>Traffic deaths down for 2019 but officials concerned about spike in death rates during virus</h1>

<p>Good news: Traffic deaths in the United States dropped for the third year in a row.</p>
<p>Bad news: Despite a 16.6% decrease in traffic during the first six months of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of traffic deaths per 100 million miles driven actually increased from 1.10 last year to 1.25.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a title="2019 traffic deaths" href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813021" target="_blank">released figures last week</a> that 36,096 died in motor vehicles crashes in 2019, down 739 (2%) from the previous year. That occurred despite the number of miles traveled increasing by nearly 1%.</p>
<p>But the agency also issued <a title="Special report on first six months of 2020" href="file:///C:/Users/Eddiepat/Downloads/dot_50940_DS1%20(1).pdf" target="_blank">a special report</a>&nbsp;examining the first six months of 2020 as a result of the increase in the rate of fatal accidents&nbsp;per miles driven. Safety officials are concerned because in previous economic downturns, reduced driving prompted a drop in traffic deaths per miles driven.</p>
<p>Preliminary estimates show traffic deaths down 3.3% through June, but officials said they expected that number to be even lower given the reduction in traffic. At the height of pandemic restrictions from April through June, the death rate rose to 1.42 per 100 million miles driven.</p>
<p>“Road safety is always our top priority, and while we are encouraged by today’s reports showing a continued decline in total fatalities in 2019 and into the first half of 2020, we are concerned by the trend since April showing an increased fatality rate,” James Owens, the agency’s deputy administrator, said in a news release Thursday. “Now, more than ever, we should be watching ourselves for safe driving practices and encouraging others to do the same.”</p>
<p>The special report said it’s extremely unusual, if not unprecedented, for the rate of deaths to increase when traffic volume is down. For example, during the 2008 recession, deaths and the rate of deaths fell as roadways experienced less traffic from people going to work or driving for vacation.</p>
<p>“It’s one of the biggest surprises in my 20-year career in traffic safety,” Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, said of the increased death rate during an interview Thursday. “I thought for sure the deaths would go down more than that.”</p>
<p>In a statement, the National Safety Council said it was&nbsp;“alarmed and discouraged by what it called “grim” numbers.</p>
<p>“While any decrease in the number of fatalities on our roads is welcome, we should be able to show a significant safety benefit from having less traffic,” the council said. “Instead, the data reflect a driving environment that has fewer cars but has become increasingly fatal.”</p>
<p>The study attributed the death rate increase to several risk factors related to the pandemic: more speeding because of reduced traffic on roadways; reduced traffic enforcement by police; increased drug and alcohol use; and less seat belt use.</p>
<p>The study claims speeding increased because drivers who previously exhibited risky behavior found themselves on nearly empty roads, encouraging them to put the pedal to the metal. One factor that gave them open spaces, the study said, is that many older, historically more responsible drivers stayed home due to virus concerns, clearing the roadways.</p>
<p>Of course, accidents at higher speeds cause more serious injuries and deaths.</p>
<p>Across the country. police agencies reported a sharp increase in drivers cited for excessive speeds of more than 100 miles an hour: Georgia State Police cited 140 drivers for exceeding 100 mph during a two-week period; police in the Los Angeles area reported citations for driving above 100 mph increased 87%; and speed-related accidents in Virginia increased to 50% from 42% compared to the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, troopers&nbsp;cited more extreme speeders in March 2020 (131 to 123) and May 2020 (199 to 184).</p>
<p>Mr. Adkins has long advocated for more attention to speeding, which he said is a hard problem to tackle because most drivers speed at least occasionally.</p>
<p>“We really need a [Mothers Against Drunk Driving] for speeding,” he said.&nbsp;“We need to make that connection that speeding is a real problem that causes deaths.”</p>
<p>Another factor allowing risky driving has been a deliberate reduction in police efforts across the country. A survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police found more than 500 agencies had reduced traffic enforcement in March and May, when the surveys were done.</p>
<p>The study also noted an increase in the use of drugs and alcohol among those injured or killed in vehicle crashes during the pandemic. A review of five trauma centers from Sept. 10, 2019, to July 18, 2020, showed greater drug and alcohol use among accident victims after the start of the pandemic in mid March, including more marijuana and opioid use.</p>
<p>Reduced seat belt use also resulted in more serious injuries, including increases in the number of people ejected from vehicles, the study said. In Minnesota, the number of unrestrained fatalities increased from 17.88% last year to 23.65% through June this year and Virginia reported a 15.4% increase in unrestrained fatalities from Jan. 1 to May 21.</p>
<p>Overall, the study found an overlap between traditional risk-taking groups and those more likely to make trips during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“It should come as no surprise that, in addition to changing the&nbsp;way we work, the way we travel, and the way we interact with others, the public health emergency has&nbsp;also changed the way we have to look at traffic safety,” the study concluded.</p>
<p>“This provides an opportunity to work collaboratively with a wide variety of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders to better identify the&nbsp;causes of the changes to traffic safety, and to identify and pursue necessary and appropriate countermeasures. It is imperative to apply strong and effective countermeasures to those who are at the highest risk of&nbsp;crashing, and to recognize the importance and leverage the value of effective law enforcement in deterring risky driving and reducing motor vehicle crashes.”</p>
