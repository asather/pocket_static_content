<h1>Travis Williams: Pirates open to potentially hosting Blue Jays at PNC Park</h1>

<p>CLEVELAND — As the Blue Jays look for a place to play their home games in 2020, president Travis Williams said the Pirates will continue to have discussions with Major League Baseball and Toronto’s baseball team to potentially make that happen at PNC Park.</p>
<p>The Pirates issued a statement Monday afternoon where Williams said the club would try its best to help, provided it could maintain health and safety during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“In an effort to help in the return of the game we all love, we continue to have active discussions with Major League Baseball and the Toronto Blue Jays organization regarding the possibility of hosting home games for the Blue Jays at PNC Park this season,” Williams said in the statement.</p>
<p>“This will be a monumental challenge for our staff, but leaning in to help others is what Pittsburghers do best.</p>
<p>“If we are able to safely accommodate, not only will it bring additional international attention to our city, it will also bring with it jobs and revenue for local hotels, restaurants and other businesses that will support the Blue Jays organization as well as additional visiting teams.”</p>
<p>Here’s why this step matters: The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/19/Blue-Jays-possibility-playing-home-games-PNC-Park-Pittsburgh/stories/202007190174" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported on Sunday</a> that the Blue Jays were looking to play games at major league stadiums after Canadian rules prohibited them from playing at Rogers Centre. Too much back and forth, the country essentially said.</p>
<p>By saying what he did Monday, Williams let the Blue Jays and the league know that they would at least check it out. The Pirates did not immediately reject the idea. It also sounds as though Williams and the Pirates are eager to help.</p>
<p>It’s likely this would work from a baseball standpoint, as only seven of the Blue Jays’ 30 home dates conflict with Pirates games — with six of those coming Sept. 8 or later.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays have flirted with the idea of having games in Buffalo, where their Class AAA affiliate is based, and Dunedin, Fla., their spring training home.</p>
<p>Both have issues. In Florida, it’s the rampant spread of COVID-19. Buffalo isn’t ideal because of poor lighting and not enough space to accommodate a major league team, especially not now with an increased focus on social distancing.</p>
<p>Williams’ statement did not provide a timeline for when a decision must be made, but it’s likely soon. The season starts Thursday (Friday for the Pirates and Jays), and Toronto’s first “home” game is July 29.</p>
