<h1>Here's how the Arconic breakup will work for shareholders</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh-based aluminum parts producer Arconic Inc. announced Thursday how its stock would be distributed to shareholders when it separates into two publicly traded companies on April 1.</p>
<p>At the time of the split, stockholders will keep their shares of Arconic Inc., which will change its name to Howmet Aerospace Inc. and assume the ticker symbol HWM.</p>
<p>In addition, they will receive one share of the spin-off company — Arconic Corp. — for every four Arconic Inc. shares they hold. Arconic Corp. will retain the Arconic Inc. ticker symbol ARNC.</p>
<p>No action is required by Arconic Inc. stockholders to receive the distributions, which are expected to be paid April 1 to shareholders of record March 19.</p>
<p>More information about the distributions is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arconic.com/" target="_blank">www.arconic.com</a>.</p>
<p>The breakup of Arconic was announced in February 2019 in the wake of the company’s failed sale to a private equity firm.</p>
<p>Under the separation, Howmet Aerospace will include the engineered products and forgings segment, while Arconic Corp. will consist of the rolled products segment.&nbsp;Arconic Inc. itself was formed from the breakup of Alcoa in 2016.</p>
