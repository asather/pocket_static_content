<p>BEIJING — China has formally charged two Canadians with espionage after more than two years in detention, Chinese prosecutors announced on Friday.</p>
<p>Former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were arrested in December 2018, in what was widely regarded as a retaliatory move after Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the request of the U.S.</p>
<p>Notices published on the Supreme People’s Procuratorate website on Friday said that Mr. Kovrig was “suspected of spying on state secrets and intelligence” and Mr. Spavor was “suspected of spying state secrets and illegally providing them to overseas forces.”</p>
<p>While Canadian officials have been allowed regular consular visits with&nbsp;Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor, the two men have had no access to lawyers or family members since they were first detained.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities accuse Mr. Meng, Huawei, a U.S. subsidiary and telecom equipment seller Skycom of committing bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The charges are linked to possible violations of U.S. sanctions against Iran.</p>
<p>Last month the Supreme Court of British Columbia said Mr. Meng can be extradited to the U.S. because the charges against her are also considered a crime in Canada.</p>
