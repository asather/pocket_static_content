<h1>Groups seek to intervene in Allegheny County elections suit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Four groups that represent voters' rights have asked to intervene to become defendants in a federal lawsuit brought against Allegheny County elections officials by a nonprofit conservative law firm.</p>
<p>The Public Interest Legal Foundation, run by a former member of Donald Trump's defunct voting integrity commission, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/02/25/Allegheny-County-voter-rolls-maintenance-lawsuit-voting-registration-act/stories/202002250168" target="_blank">filed suit in federal court last week</a> accusing the county of violating the National Voter Registration Act by not removing the names of ineligible votes from registration lists.</p>
<p>The foundation, operated by J. Christian Adams, said it has identified 15,500 names of voters who are ineligible, including dead voters who are still on the rolls, those with duplicate registrations and voters whose birthdates were more than 100 years ago, among others.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union and Demos, a liberal think tank, on Monday filed a notice to intervene in the suit on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Greater Pittsburgh and of Pennsylvania, along with One Pennsylvania and the A. Philip Randolph Institute, which represents black trade union members.</p>
<p>The NVRA requires election administrators to conduct a “reasonable effort” to remove ineligible voters from their lists.</p>
<p>But, the ACLU said, it does not instruct them to "enforce any of the procedures that [the foundation] presumably wants Allegheny County to adopt."</p>
<p>The ACLU said the foundation's suit is based on unverified numbers and doesn't take into account the removal of many names in January as part of the county's routine list maintenance.</p>
<p>If the foundation gets its way, the ACLU said, many voters may end up erroneously removed from active voter lists.</p>
<p>The county has said it does not comment on ongoing legal matters.</p>
