<h1>URA overwhelmed by demand for small business loans; Citizens Bank to help meet need</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s Urban Redevelopment Authority has been swamped with requests from small businesses for emergency loans in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>And it is now getting some help in meeting the demand, thanks to Citizens Bank.</p>
<p>URA officials established the small business emergency loan fund March 18 as the coronavirus was taking hold in the region and across the state.</p>
<p>The fund offered small businesses loans of up to $15,000 with no interest or fees for three years, with no payments for six months. The loans are available to new and existing URA small business borrowers.</p>
<p>At the start, the URA had hoped to help up to 30 businesses. But in the weeks since, it has been inundated with 270 applications totaling $3.6 million — an amount far higher than the $2.5 million the URA had allocated for the program.</p>
<p>Of those that have applied, 62 have closed and another 150 are being processed..</p>
<p>To help meet the need, Citizens Bank has stepped up with a $200,000 grant.</p>
<p>URA Executive Director Greg Flisram said in a statement Tuesday the grant will help to meet the “overwhelming need” for relief. The agency is seeking to raise another $1.7 million to help provide additional loans.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever we need local action and funding since the demand is vastly greater than the supply of funds. Despite its good intentions, federal action will not solve all of our problems; many local small businesses may have trouble accessing [Small Business Administration] funds and paycheck protection funds won’t cover all needs,”Mr. Flisram said. “The [emergency loan fund] represents flexible funding that can get out the door much more quickly and responsibly.”</p>
<p>“Our small business customers are a vital engine of the Pennsylvania economy so it is critical that we both give them an immediate leg up and bolster their long term viability,” said Dan Fitzpatrick, president of Citizens Bank, Mid-Atlantic Region.</p>
<p>The bank and its charitable foundation have directed nearly $1.5 million statewide for community and small business support.</p>
