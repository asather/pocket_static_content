You’re more than welcome to email him at bbatko@post-gazette.com, tweet him @BrianBatko or slide into his DMs to inquire about the Steelers, NFL or anything out of bounds. </em></p><p><em>Let’s get started, and don’t forget to join us on our weekly all-sports podcast, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/09/05/The-North-Shore-Drive-podcast-Best-and-worst-memories-of-the-Patriots-Steelers-rivalry/stories/201909050092" target="_blank">The North Shore Drive</a>, whether you use Apple, Spotify or any of the other major podcasting platforms.</em></p><p><strong>@BenedickUSA:</strong> Are Rudolph and Hodges both in Steelers camp next year?</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> The gut feeling here is yes. Mason Rudolph is essentially a guarantee — what are they going to do, trade him when his stock is low or outright cut a third-round pick going into Year 3? — but Duck Hodges might be on thinner ice given the way he ended the season.</p><p>I asked Mike Tomlin the biggest area of improvement Hodges needs to focus on this offseason to be in the mix again next year, and his answer Tuesday wasn't particularly encouraging.</p><p>“This is a guy that really had an awesome opportunity when you look at it — opportunity to play, opportunity to grow,” Tomlin said. “I believe he did those things. How much he grows and what it means for him in terms of his evolution as a player, we’re going to be writing that and he’s going to be writing that as we move forward.”</p><p>One interpretation of that response: Thanks for the memories, Duck, but we’ve seen all we need to see.</p><p>Now, that’s somewhat unfair to an undrafted rookie who, at least a few times in 2019, far outperformed what anyone could've expected when he was called upon to start games in the NFL. Hodges handled himself well off the field, too, when things went south, although he did bristle a bit at my question as to whether he expects the Steelers to explore adding a veteran free agent quarterback between now and next year.</p><p>“I don’t know, man,” Hodges said. “Like I’ve said, this is my first year, I don't have a clue how they do any of that. I’m here, I’m here to compete every day, and whatever happens, happens. I don't know. You’ll have to talk to the GM on that one.”</p><p>If I were Kevin Colbert, I’d certainly keep Hodges in the fold for training camp next season. He’s cheap and he has in-game experience, even if the physical tools are lacking. Not a terrible option as your third quarterback on the 53-man roster who’s inactive on game days, and if you bring in a fourth camp arm who beats him out, then that’s that.</p><p>Maybe Paxton Lynch will get a full offseason of evaluation, too.</p><p><strong>@bdockjohn25:</strong> Should T.J. Watt win DPOTY on an 8-8 team?</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Probably not, no. On one hand, it’s silly to account for team success in an individual award when you have 11 players on the field. But on the other hand, under that criteria, the list of legitimate candidates expands greatly.</p><p>Shaquil Barrett had a league-leading 19.5(!) sacks ... for 7-9 Tampa Bay. Chandler Jones had 19 sacks and eight forced fumbles, same as T.J. Watt … for 5-10-1 Arizona. While Watt had a dominant season, it probably does make sense to try to find the best defensive player for one of the best teams when you hand out awards such as these. Stephon Gilmore for New England would be my personal choice.</p><p>Watt didn't want to state his own case for the award, which isn't surprising, but fellow Steelers pass-rusher Ola Adeniyi had no trouble doing so.</p><p>“Stats don't lie. Check the stats,” Adeniyi said. “Nobody else is doing numbers that he’s doing. Picks, as well. Yeah, outside linebackers, they get sacks, but who else is catching picks, as well? Who’s consistently causing fumbles? I feel like he’s earned that. And the tape is there.”</p><p>That is a good point by Adeniyi. His 14 combined interceptions (2), forced fumbles (8) and fumble recoveries (4) are the most in the NFL and second-most by any player since 2000, courtesy of the Steelers media relations department. To Adeniyi, Watt’s most “mind-blowing” play was one of those takeaways.</p><p>“The Cardinals game, when he caught that pick, because the Cardinals were going on a good drive. They were possibly going to get points and score, and that changed the game,” Adeniyi said. “To do that at that moment? That’s huge.”</p><p>To Adeniyi’s point, the Cardinals were down, 20-10, in the first few minutes of the fourth quarter but had fourth-and-2 at the Steelers 6 when Watt picked off Kyler Murray in the end zone. Pretty huge, indeed.</p><p><strong>@BigEdBarr71:</strong> Hello Brian &amp; happy new year! In your opinion, is Bud a Steeler next year &amp; do they sign a veteran back up qb?</p><p><strong>Brian:</strong> Happy new year to you too, Ed, and thanks as always for reading. At this point, given how Tomlin spoke about it Tuesday, yes, it sure looks like Bud Dupree will be back wearing No. 48. As for a veteran quarterback? Maybe in a year when you also couldn’t use a tight end, an offensive lineman, a defensive lineman and maybe a wide receiver. And you only have so much draft capital to shore up those spots.</p><p>But hey, maybe they could get the guy who’s currently the starter in New England. It seems like he’s coming to the end of his rope and might be a little more suited for a backup role. And with their season over, this figures to be our final Steelers mailbag for a while, so might as well go on hiatus with a hot Tom Brady take. To any and all who asked questions throughout the season, or just read along, we appreciate you.</p><p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/newsletters" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/.media/2/2019/07/16/82363a69-0f98-4abe-a687-ccd4ea9b637e.jpg" alt="Go to section"></a></p><p><em>Be sure to compliment <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeStarkey1" target="_blank">Joe Starkey</a>.
