<h1>Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra reaches out in a big way in 2020-21 season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Orchestras around the country are promising to connect more with local communities to increase their cultural&nbsp; value. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is delivering on that promise.</p>
<p>In announcing its 125th season Monday evening, PSO leaders detailed&nbsp;new partnerships&nbsp;with numerous local organizations in 2020-21 to celebrate the orchestra’s musical legacy and ties to the city.&nbsp;That’s in addition to several world premieres, appearances by some of the world’s greatest musicians, the debut of a brand new Steinway grand piano, an international tour and continued community and education programming that takes brings musicians and Pittsburghers together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement follows high praise in a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/10/the-pittsburgh-symphonys-savage-precision" target="_blank">recent New Yorker column for the orchestra’s “savage precision”</a> and music director Manfred Honeck’s attention to detail.</p>
<p>“We have been reflecting a little on what we have done, where we are, where we want to go as an orchestra,” Mr. Honeck said in a phone interview Monday from his home in Austria. “We wanted to do things that are special and unique to Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Partnering organizations include Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh, Manchester Craftsmen’s Guild, Pittsburgh CLO, Pittsburgh Public Theater and&nbsp;the Allegheny County Library Association. The new collaborative programs will send symphony musicians out to perform in community spaces and&nbsp;bring more local performers into Heinz Hall.</p>
<p>“Organizations like the libraries and the museums have been immediately enthusiastic. They’ve expressed interest in continuing to collaborate after the season,” said&nbsp;Mary Persin, PSO vice president of artistic planning and a principal architect of programming alongside Mr. Honeck.&nbsp;“Maybe these could continue as summer festival programming.”</p>
<p>She added that such partnerships are dependent on finding funding and mutually beneficial programming. An example: In October, Mr. Honeck will lead the orchestra in Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring,” as Pittsburgh Ballet Theater performs choreography by the renowned Glenn Tetley, a Wilkinsburg native who died in 2007.</p>
<p>Next season includes the 250th anniversary of Beethoven’s birth, and orchestras around the world are exploring his legacy by programming significant swaths of his repertoire. The PSO will perform all nine Beethoven symphonies in a single weekend, and another weekend comprises all five piano concertos.&nbsp;Throughout the fall, members of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra will perform all 16 Beethoven string quartets in more than 20 libraries for free. Musicians will also perform in the Carnegie Science Center, and as part of the Manchester Crafstmen’s Guild jazz subscription season. A season-long collaboration with Carnegie Museum of Art will pair a piece of art from its permanent collection with each of the orchestra’s 20 classical subscription concerts.</p>
<p>The list of composers commissioned by the orchestra next season includes familiar names like Mason Bates, James MacMillan and Michael Daugherty as well as names new to the orchestra: Gloria Isabel Ramos Triano and Stacy Garrop. There will be a collaboration between composer Kathryn Bostic, author Jessica Lanay Moore and Pittsburgh multimedia artist Njaimeh Njie for the fourth annual&nbsp;“Lift Every Voice” concert, which brings together an assortment of performing artists. And for the first time, the Pittsburgh Symphony will perform music by jazz legend Wynton Marsalis, his Violin Concerto in D Major, in March 2021.</p>
<p>The PNC Pops series will welcome new principal pops conductor Byron Stripling in October. The six-concert series includes tributes to ABBA, Motown, Marvin Hamlisch and more.</p>
<p>Cellist and cultural ambassador Yo-Yo Ma, who visited Braddock for a community tour in 2018, will return for a three-day residency that includes a lecture, community activities and a concert. Other noteworthy soloists include pianists Helene Grimaud and Emanuel Ax, who will debut the orchestra’s new concert piano in September, violinists Gil Shaham and Christian Tetzlaff, singer Matthias Goerne and PSO principal trumpet Micah Wilkinson.</p>
<p>In February 2021, Mr. Honeck will lead the orchestra and the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh in Mahler’s Symphony No. 8, the “Symphony of a Thousand,” a massive work that the orchestra has never before performed.</p>
<p>While the symphony typically opens its season with a gala in late September, next season begins in Heinz Hall with a program of Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Scheherazade,” John Adams’ “Century Rolls” and the world premiere of Michael Daugherty’s “Fifteen” for orchestra.</p>
<p>“[Michael] is one of these composers interested in using a theme to connect with musicians and listeners,” Mr. Honeck said. “His music is very vivid and colorful.”</p>
<p>The theme of the piece centers on Andy Warhol’s famous remark: “In the future, everyone will be world famous for 15 minutes.” The music will be a mini concerto for orchestra that features individual instruments for brief periods.</p>
<p>The symphony will host a 125th anniversary celebration in Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland in October.</p>
<p>The orchestra’s fame and renown have been rising in recent years thanks to regular Grammy award nominations and a win in 2017, positive national and international press, prestigious international tours and a unique ability to infuse well-known orchestral warhorses with new vigor.</p>
<p>“I’d rather stop conducting than settle for mediocrity,” said Mr. Honeck, whose contract with the orchestra is currently set to expire in 2022.</p>
<p>“If you are surrounded by people who work and think in the same way, then you are blessed. We are not satisfied with just good. The quality of the performance is the most important thing to us. Our team is gold.”</p>
