<h1>Wolf asks all Pennsylvanians to wear masks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Amid another sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf and state Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine issued new guidance today asking all residents to wear a cloth or homemade mask whenever leaving the home.</p>
<p>“Today, I’m asking all Pennsylvanians to wear a mask anytime you leave your house,” Mr. Wolf said. “Masks help prevent people from sharing illnesses.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wolf and Dr. Levine both emphasized that mask-wearing does not change the primary social distancing guidance, to stay at home whenever possible and maintain six feet of distance from other people whenever in public. Mask-wearing in public, they said, should only be for “life-sustaining” excursions from the home, such as trips to grocery stores, pharmacies and to take care of the elderly.</p>
<p>“They don’t do a great job at keeping people from getting sick, and they’re not foolproof, so it’s critical that our first act, as Secretary Levine said, is to ask ourselves if we really need to leave our house,” Mr. Wolf said. “If we don’t really, truly need to leave, then we shouldn’t.”</p>
<p>Dr. Levine also stressed that Pennsylvanians should not wear N95 masks, surgical masks or others designed for medical professionals, as those need to be reserved for individuals “on the front lines” of combating the virus, emergency responders and health care workers.</p>
<p>“Do not purchase masks designed for health care professionals,” the state’s guidance says. It recommends that people make their own masks or purchase cloth masks online, and that businesses should consider purchasing homemade or cloth masks for employees.</p>
<p>The guidance, posted to the Department of Health’s website, states that “homemade masks can be an effective complement to handwashing, social-distancing and other mitigation measures.”</p>
<p>Masks function as an effective mitigation measure, the guidance explains, because they help to “limit the spread of infectious droplets in the air.” A mask does not protect the wearer; it protects those around the wearer: “my mask protects you, and your mask protects me.”</p>
<p>The guidance provides instructions on how to make cloth masks at home and additional details on acceptable mask use.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one of the first states to officially encourage residents to wear masks when in public. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham issued similar guidance on Thursday.</p>
