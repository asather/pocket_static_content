<h1>Thomas Jefferson's Devin Danielson could be Pitt's answer at defensive tackle</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Thomas Jefferson head coach Bill Cherpak had to remove Devin Danielson from practice on occasion. The former Jaguars defensive tackle and current Pitt pass-rusher wasn’t being punished. But the scout team quarterback was.</p>
<p>“He was so destructive that we couldn’t get a look from the scout team,” Cherpak said. “He was in the backfield making a play every single time. ... He was just a force.”</p>
<p>These days, Danielson isn’t being pulled from practice on the South Side. But he is garnering praise as the 2020 season inches closer and Pitt looks for a Jaylen Twyman replacement.</p>
<p>Danielson hasn’t openly been named the successor to Twyman, the second-team&nbsp;All-American who opted out to prepare for the 2021 NFL draft. With no official depth chart to go off of and no in-person access to training camp due to COVID-19, it’s difficult to know where exactly the defensive tackle battle stands. But Danielson, a 6-foot-1, 300-pound redshirt sophomore, appears to be in pole position to start alongside Keyshon Camp.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, when asked if any player has changed positions and moved to tackle, Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi said: “Obviously we’ve got Keyshon Camp and Devin Danielson and we’ve got pretty good depth in there with David Green, (Tyler) Bentley, Calijah Kancey.” Starting offensive tackle Carter Warren added that Danielson has “become a true leader” in the absence of Twyman. Not to mention Danielson was behind Twyman on last year’s depth chart and is the only tackle other than Camp with a start in his Pitt career.</p>
<p>Bentley played in all 13 games last year. Green, a Central Catholic product, played in 12. Kancey is an intriguing redshirt freshman who saw action in the Quick Lane Bowl. All of them figure to factor in this season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Danielson, who acknowledged that “everyone’s trying to fight” for Twyman’s spot, also said it’d be a “dream come true” to start Pitt’s Sept. 12 opener against Austin Peay. And he looks poised to do that at the moment.</p>
<p>That doesn’t surprise Cherpak. And it doesn’t shock Thomas Jefferson defensive line coach Pat Oster, either.</p>
<p>Oster, who first noticed Danielson as a “nasty” eighth-grade wrestler, later watched as he imposed his will during preseason camp as a freshman. Danielson was 255 pounds as a freshman, then got up to 275 as a 10th-grader. At that point, the four-year starter was an integral piece in Thomas Jefferson’s run to a WPIAL title.</p>
<p>“By the time we got to the playoffs his sophomore season, he was a man,” Oster said. “We really realized how good he was and how much better he was going to get when we beat West Allegheny.”</p>
<p>In Nov. 2015, Thomas Jefferson took out West Allegheny, 14-0, in the WPIAL Class 3A quarterfinals. Oster recalls West Allegheny coach Bob Palko approaching Cherpak after the game and asking about “No. 79.” Palko shook his head when Cherpak told him Danielson was only a sophomore.</p>
<p>The following season, Danielson was just one of two juniors named to the Post-Gazette Fabulous 22. Oddly enough, Danielson will try to sack the other junior — Pine-Richland standout and Notre Dame transfer Phil Jurkovec — when Pitt travels to Boston College on Oct. 10.</p>
<p>Danielson, a three-star recruit in the 2018 class, spurned interest from Boston College and picked Pitt over offers from Iowa, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan State and 10 other Power Five programs. Danielson said Wednesday that a primary reason why he picked Pitt was so he could play in front of family and friends at Heinz Field. Whether or not his parents and thousands of other Pitt fans will be allowed in those yellow seats this fall is an entirely different question.</p>
<p>But few around Pitt’s facility doubt Danielson’s ability. He started against Ohio in place of senior Amir Watts in Pitt’s Week 2 win. And in limited reps last fall, he logged 14 tackles and four quarterback pressures, flashing his power and quickness off the ball. Again, that’s in limited spurts spelling Twyman, and it’s going to take more than spurts — and realistically, more than just Danielson — to make up for a player of Twyman’s quality.</p>
<p>However, Danielson has an opportunity ahead of him. And those at Thomas Jefferson are eager to see what he does with it.</p>
<p>“He’s just tough,” Oster said. “I would describe the way he plays is as a bull. He just charges upfield and wreaks havoc in the backfield.”</p>
<p>“I’m really excited,” Danielson said of the Sept. 12 opener. “Just looking forward to that day.”</p>
