<h1>Gene Therapy | Escape from Simferopol: A Pittsburgh family's not-so-excellent holiday adventure</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Until about midweek, I’d fully intended to allow International Women’s Day to fly into the rearview mirror without comment, but I kept thinking about Jan and Jackie and that story they told me a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>I had to call, just to see if now, 19 years after the whole preposterous set of facts calcified into 48 breathless hours in Ukraine, they were still inoculated against ignoring International Women’s Day.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>“I thought we would perish several times,” Jackie said matter-of-factly. “At least the night we spent in Warsaw, we could finally get a decent glass of wine.”</p>
<p>So yeah, it’s complicated, but it’s always worth a retell because all the characters know that had they taken this narrative to Hollywood, it would have been rejected as too absurd even for the big screen.</p>
<p>Jan had flown to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv with her husband, Rocky Bleier, the former Steelers running back (maybe you’ve heard of him), for the purpose of adopting two Ukrainian orphans at the end of a wondrously hopeful process that had been going on for months. The orphanage was in Simferopol, a short flight from Kyiv.</p>
<p>Aboard the prop jet, vodka was served.</p>
<p>To the pilots.</p>
<p>The Ukraine equivalent of the FAA, if there is one, apparently has slightly more liberal protocols.</p>
<p>But they got there, met their new family — 3-year-old Elly and 2-year-old Rosie — and began preparations to bring the girls home to Pittsburgh. Rocky was to depart a day early for a speaking engagement in the Caribbean, but a snowstorm that blew in off the Black Sea grounded all flights. His only alternative was a nine-hour drive back to Kyiv in the snow.</p>
<p>Enter the man called Badim.</p>
<p>Badim would drive Rocky to the airport in Kyiv. He’d come highly recommended by Nick, a Ukrainian adoption facilitator working the Bleiers’ case. “Do not worry,” Nick told Rocky in a disquieting Boris Badenov cadence, “is professional driver.”</p>
<p>So Rocky got in Badim’s car and did not worry. It started to snow. Rocky fell asleep, so unworried was he. When he awoke, the car was in somebody’s driveway and had been jacked up. Someone was wrestling with a new tire. It would be jacked up three more times to install a whole set of snow tires, all with Rock inside. Do not worry. The man was a professional.</p>
<p>Rocky made the flight and the connection in Frankfurt, but both involved running through airports, running harder than he had since Rocky Bleier Day at Three Rivers Stadium 21 years earlier.</p>
<p>In the meantime, as planned, Jackie had arrived in Simferopol to help Jan in this transition, bringing along their father.</p>
<p>“We were supposed to be leaving Ukraine on March 8,” Jan remembered again this week. “We were all packed and ready. Then Nick, the facilitator, walked into the apartment where were staying. He was holding two roses.”</p>
<p>“It was 7 a.m.,” Jackie said.</p>
<p>Nick gave one rose to Jan and one to Jackie.</p>
<p>“And then,” Jan said, “He said this: ‘We’ve encountered a situation.’”</p>
<p>It was International Women’s Day, March 8, 2001. Neither Jan nor Jackie had ever heard of International Women’s Day. They thanked Nick for the flowers but still didn’t understand the “situation.” This was because they had failed to commit to memory the short list of countries where International Women’s Day is a very big deal akin to Valentine’s Day: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia and — ding ding ding — Ukraine!</p>
<p>“So what?” you might be asking.</p>
<p>So the banks are closed, schools are closed, businesses are closed, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv is closed. To get the orphans on a flight home, they first had to be shepherded through the embassy in Kyiv, then through another embassy in Warsaw. And there was no way this party could reschedule flights in such a way to get all that accomplished the very next day, which was a Friday, which meant the embassy in Warsaw closed at noon.</p>
<p>Because Friday.</p>
<p>Which somehow made sense in Poland.</p>
<p>The only possible solution was for Jan and Jackie’s dad to get to Warsaw ahead of them and plead to keep the place open. But who would take him to the airport?</p>
<p>Re-enter Badim, a couple of hours late, which you’d say was unprofessional if you didn’t already know not to worry, “is professional driver.”</p>
<p>Badim drove dad to the airport at a speed approximating those achieved in “Mad Max: Fury Road,” though there were fewer explosions. Sidewalks were Badim’s personal HOV lane. Pedestrians leaped for their lives, helpfully. At the airport, the plane was boarded and on the runway. They held it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Simferopol, Jan and Jackie could do nothing but wait for it not to be International Women’s Day, and panic.</p>
<p>“Part of it was that March 9 was my daughter’s birthday,” Jackie said. “She was young, and she made me promise I’d be back for that. We didn’t make it, but I don’t remember it as a dark time necessarily. I was so happy for Jan.”</p>
<p>In those moments though, a world away, nerves could get mangled.</p>
<p>“One time, we wanted a cup of coffee, and we got in a car with this guy, Nikolai — that’s when I felt the most scared,” Jan said. “We wanted him to take us to McDonald’s, but he didn’t speak English, we couldn’t read the signs, we couldn’t ask anybody. But he found the golden arches.”</p>
<p>On March 9, things went just smoothly enough to get Jan, Jackie, their dad, Elly and Rosie through every procedural labyrinth and onto a plane out over the Atlantic, enabling a happy ending that took root in Pittsburgh and has endured ever since.</p>
<p>Elly graduates from Notre Dame on May 26. Rosie is a junior at Duquesne.</p>
<p>Jan and Jackie mostly laugh about it now.</p>
<p>“I wish the girls could understand,” Jan said. “They never will.”</p>
<p>Maybe not, but I’ll bet they know when it’s International Women’s Day.</p>
