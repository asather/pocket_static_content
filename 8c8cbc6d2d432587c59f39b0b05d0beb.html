<p>WASHINGTON — As the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps the country, a battle over “hoaxes” on the public airwaves is reaching federal regulators empowered with overseeing broadcasters at a time Americans need access to accurate, life-saving information on the virus from health officials.</p>
<p>At the center of it all, the Federal Communication Commission has been under fire both for saying too much and for not saying enough.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a Republican&nbsp;FCC commissioner slammed a media advocacy organization for asking the commission to investigate broadcasters for widely airing remarks by conservative commentators downplaying the virus, including remarks made by President Donald Trump and KDKA Radio personality Wendy Bell.</p>
<p>“This is a sweeping and dangerous attempt by the left to weaponize the&nbsp;FCC against conservative broadcasters and politicians,” Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee confirmed by the Senate in 2017, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1245763388266942492" target="_blank">wrote on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>“And it is a clear signal of the agenda the left will pursue if they regain control of the FCC,” Mr. Carr added. “Censoring speech that does not fit their orthodoxy.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/2020-03/free_press_petition_for_inquiry_to_fcc_re_broadcast_misinformation.pdf" target="_blank">its&nbsp;FCC petition</a>, the media group, Free Press, catalogued a number of what it called dangerous disinformation that caused “substantial public harm” as the virus spread quickly in February and March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The filing listed Mr. Trump’s repeated suggestion that an anti-malarial drug could safely treat the virus. Last month, an Arizona couple drank a toxic form of the drug, called chloroquine, which led to the husband’s death and the hospitalization of the wife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group also cited comments made by Ms. Bell on March 19 that compared the COVID-19 pandemic to the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. Ms. Bell, responding to a caller, said she believed the news media was hyping the COVID-19 pandemic because they dislike Mr. Trump — and treated coverage of the swine flu differently because journalists “fiercely defended” former President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>“Why the fervor to cover this like the plague when legitimately we lost 13,000 Americans [during the swine flu pandemic]? Where was the breathless coverage then?” Ms. Bell said. “Why wasn’t the market a complete disaster?”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_2" target="_blank">World Health Organization has warned</a> the COVID-19’s mortality rate is significantly higher than the H1N1 swine flu&nbsp;and potentially far more contagious. And U.S. health officials are so worried about the virus’ spread among asymptomatic people that they are expected to recommend all Americans wear homemade face coverings when outside.</p>
<p>Ms. Bell did not immediately return a request for comment on Friday. The FCC also did not respond.</p>
<p>The petition — and Mr. Carr’s comments —&nbsp;came as the&nbsp;FCC faced another potential dilemma.</p>
<p>In a separate matter, the Trump campaign has issued cease-and-desist letters to broadcasters across the country who aired a Democratic campaign ad that were critical of Mr. Trump’s comments downplaying the virus.</p>
<p>The “Exponential Threat” ad — which aired in Pennsylvania,&nbsp;Michigan, Wisconsin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Florida beginning last week —&nbsp;was part of a $6 million TV and digital ads in battleground states bought by Priorities USA in support of former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ad, showing snippets of Mr. Trump’s campaign rally on Feb. 28, claimed Mr. Trump called COVID-19 a “hoax.”</p>
<p>“We have it totally under control,” Mr. Trump said during the rally. “It's one person coming in from China. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear. When you have 15 people and within a couple of days is gonna be down to close to zero.”</p>
<p>Alex W. Cannon, a Trump campaign lawyer, wrote that the ads were “deliberately false and misleading” because Mr. Trump had clearly stated the true hoax was “the Democrats’ falsification of his record in an attempt to discredit his presidency.”</p>
<p>On Thursday,&nbsp;Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/FCC.4.2.2020.%20Letter%20to%20FCC%20re.%20Trump%20license%20renewal.CAT_.pdf" target="_blank">demanded that the commission</a> condemn the Trump campaign’s letters, which suggested the broadcasters' FCC licenses should be revoked unless they immediately cease airing the ad.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle, a top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, along with New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, the committee’s chairman, wrote the&nbsp;FCC needs to affirm the broadcasters’ free speech rights are protected from political influence.</p>
<p>“At a time when autocratic governments around the world are using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to suppress press freedoms, we must reaffirm — not undermine — America’s commitment to a free press,” the letter stated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview Friday, Mr. Doyle said he had seen the ads on TV and argued they did not twist the president’s words.</p>
<p>“The FCC should reaffirm that they’re not going to take people’s licenses away just because the president of the United States doesn’t like what’s being said,” Mr. Doyle said.&nbsp;“We live in a democracy, and no one can threaten journalists or broadcasters.”</p>
<p>Taken together, the disputes put the FCC in a potentially uncomfortable position.</p>
<p>The FCC among a slew of independent federal agencies whose work is outside of the executive departments directly overseen by the White House. Other examples include Federal Election Commission, Federal Trade Commission and the National Labor Relations Board.</p>
<p>Its members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, so a president can usually fill those boards with a majority of like-minded nominees. The FCC currently holds a 3-2 Republican majority.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918112884630093825" target="_blank">previously threatened</a>&nbsp;NBC’s broadcast license in 2017 after the network ran a story that Mr. Trump proposed increasing the U.S.&nbsp;nuclear weapons stockpile. Mr. Trump tweeted the story was&nbsp;“pure fiction.”</p>
<p>At that time,&nbsp;FCC Chairman Ajit Pai publicly assured broadcasters.&nbsp;“I believe in the First Amendment,” Mr. Pai told a conference shortly after Mr. Trump’s tweets. The commission “does not have the authority to revoke the license of a broadcast station based on the content of a particular newscast.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>The&nbsp;FCC can regulate content under its 1992 “broadcast hoax” rule, which grants the commission authority to penalize stations that “for broadcasts that create a foreseeable&nbsp;risk of personal injury.” The rule was adopted after a St. Louis radio station falsely told listeners a nuclear attack was underway in the Persian Gulf War.</p>
<p>Matt Wood, an attorney for Free Press, said his group’s petition was not a complaint against any one broadcaster but rather an informal request the&nbsp;FCC to open an inquiry and issue guidance. The&nbsp;“broadcast hoax” rule has been rarely used and most often applied to&nbsp;“April fools jokes gone awry,” Mr. Wood said.</p>
<p>“We are, admittedly, looking at this statute and saying we think this should apply to other situations,” Mr. Wood said.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, during a <a href="https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1240672025989001221" target="_blank">press briefing on March 19</a>, said chloroquine&nbsp;“has been around for a long time, so we know if things don't go as planned it's not going to kill&nbsp;anybody.” Less than a week later, the Arizona couple drank chloroquine they had in their house that was used in fish tank cleaner.</p>
<p>From the hospital, the wife told NBC News they drank the drug because they had watched the White House coronavirus briefings and believed it was safe because “it was all over TV.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fight over virus disinformation comes as most Americans are getting their virus updates from cable television, according to a survey from Pew Research Center. The research organization found people getting their news on social media were most likely to report misinformation. About 57% reported&nbsp;“a lot” or&nbsp;“some” misinformation on social media, compared with 45% reporting misinformation on cable TV.&nbsp;</p>
