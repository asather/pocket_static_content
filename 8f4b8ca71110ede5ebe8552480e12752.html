<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 10.07.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, we will start our chat in just a few minutes so get ready <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, let’s get started. Go..!!</p>
<p><strong>Nick from VA</strong>: More positive COVID cases from Tennessee. If they can’t play again this week, think there’s any chance they forfeit their next game? If so, shouldn’t the Steelers also benefit from the miss as well? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I really don’t think there will be a forfeit. There has never been one in the history of the league. But, if there is, I don’t think the league would retroactively award the Steelers a forfeit.</p>
<p><strong>Nick from VA</strong>: I can’t remember if it’s only at Philly or just overall, but I believe Ben’s record against Philly is below .500 for his career. I’m nervous about Philly this week. Should I be? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Idon’t think he is worried about the past so neither should you Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Carl</strong>: Hi Jerry, any update on how Wisniewski‘s recovery is progressing? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nothing more than the original prognosis, which was he’d be out 4 to 6 weeks but won’t need surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Nick from VA</strong>: Hi Gerry. Love your chats, you and all your colleagues! One thing I’ve been wondering. A Federal Judge has ruled all of Governor Wolf’s restrictions unconstitutional, which means they are not legal or enforceable. Why are the Steeler’s not allowing more fans at the games? I realize most of their revenue comes from the TV contracts, but there is a lot of revenue generated for the local economy from having fans at the games. Plus, there’s nothing like seeing a rowdy black and gold, towel waving fan base at the games. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Because the league and the Steelers are trying to abide by the decisions of each state’s government. Allowing more fans will only potentially exacerbate an already growing problem.</p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: A few folks have asked (Ray’s chat yesterday) about the schedule being tougher than expected. I know the Browns have potential, but until they put together .500 season or better, I would be willing to play them every week. The Bengals are a long way off from.500 ball. And the NFC east remaining opponents: Dal, Wash, and Philly, have three combined wins of 12 games played. If we win 5 or 6 of those games, which based on our performance and those teams listed, is not unrealistic, that puts us at 8 or 9 wins. Do these folks have any reason to be concerned? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That’s why you can’t look at a team’s schedule before the season and predict what might happen.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: James Washington at times looks great (thinking that touchdown bulldoze). What’s holding him back from being a true number 2? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I agree, and I think it’s consistency in his route running. Sometimes he just seems to be a step or two out of sync.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph</strong>: How is Justin Lane progressing. Is he ready to fill an open spot next year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He is coming along fine. He might have to wait even one more year before he can become a semi-regular. But they like his size and speed.</p>
<p><strong>San Diego Steeler Fan</strong>: I just read that 2 more Titans players and a N.E. Patriot tected positive for covid. So I am assuming both teams will not play this Sunday. How many times does a team test positive before the League steps in and make them forfeit games.? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Don’t assume that, but, as Cam Heyward said today, you have to assume there are going to be positive tests throughout the season. Not sure why they are occurring now when we didn’t see any for the first 3 weeks. I think we’ll be curious to see if the league intends to punish a team for a forfeit when this problem is not the fault of one person, one team, or even one league. It is a global problem.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Good morning Gerry. Is there a reason why the Steelers rarely use the screen pass? Is it because of the scheme or perhaps Ben is not comfortable throwing that particular pass? Come to think of it, Bradshaw seemed to <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I know they don’t do it a lot, but they do use it. Plus, they are not a screen team. They are a down-the-field passing attack</p>
<p><strong>Harry</strong>: Good morning Garry It seems like the last few times that they met the Eagles hurried and threw off Ben’s timing. Is this years O line ready to old them off? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Hold might be the operative word here. The league officials are calling fewer holding penalties this year. But, I think the Eagles should be more worried about “holding” off the Steelers pass rush than the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: With the Steelers being permitted to have fans this week, does that mean more media will be s <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph</strong>: Do you think the Steelers feel they can replace Al V with the current group of O linemen? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think for the interim, yes, especially with Okorafor. That being said, as of right now, I expect the Steelers first pick in the draft to be an offensive tackle.</p>
<p><strong>Where’s my Clark Bar?</strong>: Hi Gerry, what are your thoughts on the Wormley signing this far? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, he was held back by injuries in training camp and only getting a few snaps right now. I think we need more time to evaluate him.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Is the league screwing us if the Titans forfeit the Bills game? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ben seems to think that could be the case. <span style="color: #14171a;">“Of course we got the short end of the stick,” he said today.</span></p>
<p><strong>Brenda</strong>: Gerry, who are some of the top golfers on the Steelers? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Best player: Ben. Best coach: Butler</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Do the Eagles concern you? They seem inconsistent &amp; you never know which team is gonna show up- <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I hate to tell you, but, outside of a cut shot from the fairway rough, very little concerns me. Ok, to answer your question, I think the 49ers discovered what can happen if you’re not concerned about a team. And I’ll say this for the Eagles: They are a team that seems to get better as the season goes on under Doug Pederson.</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: Do you know If there was any discussion of moving the TN game to Heinz field on the 25th since they caused the game to be rescheduled in the first place? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I checked....none. Plus, why would the Steelers (or the governor) want to bring an infected unit in their stadium and their state?</p>
<p><strong>D. Bush</strong>: Since I have the flat out speed, what is preventing me from bring good in coverage? Quickness and change of direction? Or just lack of experience? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Probably being in this chat.</p>
<p><strong>Hogan</strong>: What’s so hard about a cut shot from a good lie? Aim a little left, open the face slightly, swing along your foot line. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Thanx doctor</p>
<p><strong>D. Weis</strong>: Will connor have a break-out game against Philly? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He’s had two 100-yard games already. If, by breakout, you mean a 200-yard game, well, I’llhold off on that one.</p>

<p><strong>Nick from VA</strong>: Will you or any of your colleagues be at the game this weekend? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes, me and Ray</p>
<p><strong>D. Weis</strong>: How far away is Claypool from becoming a norm on the field? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You will see him get more and more playing time, but the Steelers have the luxury of having four pretty good wide receivers plus a receiving tight end like Eric Ebron.</p>
<p><strong>Nick from VA</strong>: Since the Eagles tight ends are pretty good, I’m concerned about the defense being able to stop them. The D hasn’t done very well in covering tight ends, it feels like forever. Is this a concern? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: With very few exceptions, if you have to worry about covering a team’s tight end, you don’t have a lot to worry about. Let em catch the 10- to 12-yard pass over the middle. As long as they don’t get behind you</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: We need to have more opportunities for the new maryland rb seems like a game breaker <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think you will see those against the Eagles.</p>
<p><strong>Nick from VA</strong>: When will we see the color rush uniforms this year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t know the answer to that. Sorry <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, we’re out of time. Have to scurry to practice. Thanx for the questions, as always. See you next week,</p>
