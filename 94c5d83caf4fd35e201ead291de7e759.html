<h1>Pittsburgh's Favorite Champions voting: Penguins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s major pro sports franchises have won 16 championships since the early 1900s. Nearby colleges Pitt and Penn State have contributed a handful of national championships in football through the years, too. So which team is Post-Gazette readers’ favorite? We’ll find out in our Pittsburgh’s Favorite Champions series.</p>
<p>Today, we take a look at the Penguins’ Stanley Cup-winning squads. Vote for your favorite below, and the winner will go up against readers favorite Steelers, Pirates and college teams in a new poll next week.</p>

<p>The Penguins’ first Stanley Cup team had to overcome a pretty significant hurdle, as Mario Lemieux — one of the faces of the sport alongside Wayne Gretzky — missed roughly three quarters of that season because of a back injury. Such luck might have ruined other teams. But this group? Just a quick look at the roster tells the tale of how it survived. Lemieux, Ron Francis, Paul Coffey, Joe Mullen, Larry Murphy, Mark Recchi and Bryan Trottier already are in the Hall of Fame. Jaromir Jagr is a lock to join them some day. Goalie Tom Barrasso <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2020/06/24/Pittsburgh-Penguins-goalie-Tom-Barrasso-hockey-hall-of-fame/stories/202006240033" target="_blank">still has some hope, too</a>. That’s nine guys, darn near half the skaters on the roster, who were among the greatest to ever play. You won’t find many teams in hockey history that were more loaded. It’s almost a miracle Minnesota pushed those guys to even six games in the Stanley Cup final. And oh, yeah. Lemieux ended up winning the Conn Smythe Trophy by scoring 16 goals and notching 28 assists in the playoffs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>1992 </strong></span></p>
<p>A year later, the Penguins tumbled a bit after a strong start to the season. Lemieux’s back issues cost him some games, and midseason trades that sent away Coffey and Recchi signaled that a repeat wouldn’t be as simple as repeating the gameplan from ‘91. The person implementing it had changed, too. “Badger” Bob Johnson resigned as coach during the offseason because of brain cancer before succumbing to the disease in November 1991. Enter Scotty Bowman, who led the team through all of that tumult to have it playing as well as it ever did in the era by the end of the playoffs. After a pair of tough six-game series against Washington and the Presidents’ Trophy-winning New York Rangers, the Penguins swept their way through both the conference and Stanley Cup finals against Boston and Chicago, respectively, to repeat.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>2009 </strong></span></p>
<p>Winning any championship is special. This win, however, was particularly sweet because it was personal. The Penguins had lost the Stanley Cup to the Detroit Red Wings the year before. Then in the offseason, prized trade deadline acquisition Marian Hossa chose the champs over the Penguins in free agency, believing they had a better chance in ‘09. He looked like he might have made the right choice for a while, as the Penguins swooned through February, fired coach Michel Therrien and replaced him with the coach of their Wilkes-Barre affiliate, Dan Bylsma. That proved to be just the jumpstart the players needed. Led by captain Sidney Crosby and scoring title winner Evgeni Malkin, they closed the season on an 18-3-4 hot streak that continued right through the playoffs. This time, two Max Talbot goals and a heroic save by Marc Andre-Fleury in Game 7 against Detroit clinched the Cup, and almost as satisfyingly, denied Hossa the right to hoist it himself.</p>

<p>The rapturous start to the Crosby/Malkin years had turned to malaise by this winter. Injuries had derailed multiple playoff runs, and even the 2015 offseason acquisition of feared finisher Phil Kessel failed to deliver the jolt the club needed immediately, as it suffered a February slump reminiscent of ‘09. Once again, a midseason coaching change proved to be the catalyst. Mike Sullivan <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/philadelphia-flyers/penguins-fire-coach-mike-johnston-mike-sullivan-takes-over" target="_blank">took over for Mike Johnston</a> in December 2015, and team took off. The highlight? A six-game dogfight with bitter rival Washington in which the famed “HBK” like of Kessel, Nick Bonino and Carl Hagelin became the highest producing line on a championship team. And Crosby wasn’t bad himself, claiming the Conn Smythe Trophy with six goals and 13 assists. Belief was back, and there to stay for a while.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>2017 </strong></span></p>
<p>The repeat bid looked poised to implode on the launch pad when star defenseman Kris Letang was lost to neck surgery in April. And that was before goalie Matt Murray — who had dethroned Marc-Andre Fleury as starting goalie a year earlier — was lost for weeks with a freak injury suffered in warm-ups before the first game of the playoffs. It was a good thing Fleury was still around. The club’s longtime stalwart between the pipes stepped into the starting role once more and shined in series wins against Columbus and Washington. Murray returned in the Eastern Conference final against Ottawa, which ended with a thrilling overtime winner from Chris Kunitz in Game 7, and the Penguins dispatched a plucky Nashville team in six games to prove their resiliency and hoist the holy chalice once more. They became the first team since the Red Wings of the late 1990s to repeat.</p>
