<h1>Pitt-West Virginia men's basketball game won't happen this year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The far-reaching impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted any number of cancellations on the sports calendar. Now, it has managed to break up a Backyard Brawl.</p>
<p>The men’s basketball game between longtime rivals Pitt and West Virginia that was scheduled for Nov. 13 at the WVU Coliseum will not take place, Mountaineers coach Bob Huggins said on a video conference call with reporters Thursday.</p>
<p>“It has been postponed, moved back, delayed, whatever,” Huggins said. “That’s not going to happen this year.”</p>
<p>The matchup was the fourth and final of a series originally agreed to in Aug. 2016. In June, the two universities, separated by only about 75 miles, signed on for a two-game extension, with contests scheduled for yet-to-be-determined dates during the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons.</p>
<p>Given the state of college basketball, a sport working furiously to set up a feasible plan for the 2020-21 season, the game’s postponement isn’t surprising. Last month, the NCAA’s Division I Council voted to begin its season Nov. 25, with teams allowed to play a maximum of 24 or 25 games, along with one multiple-team event.</p>
<p>The ACC has yet to reveal its scheduling structure for the season. Last season, each of the league’s 15 teams had 20 intraconference games.</p>
<p>According to a contract signed by Pitt and West Virginia in Sept. 2016, neither party is responsible to the other for any related loss or damage stemming from the game being impossible to play “for reasons of power failure, strikes, severe weather conditions, riots, wars, or other unforeseen catastrophes or disasters or circumstances beyond the control of the party.” Additionally, no cancellation shall affect “the parties’ obligations as to subsequent games covered by this agreement.”</p>
<p>The Mountaineers are the Panthers’ most-played opponent in program history, with 187 all-time meetings between the two. West Virginia leads the series, 99-88, a mark that has included victories in each of the three meetings since the rivalry was renewed.</p>
