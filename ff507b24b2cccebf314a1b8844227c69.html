<h1>Bridge work closes Lowrie and Rialto streets in Troy Hill until December</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Work will begin Monday to permanently correct a problem discovered more than two years ago on the Lowrie Street Bridge in Troy Hill, and the project will close the bridge and Rialto Street underneath it until December.</p>
<p>In April 2018, Rialto Street was closed for 12 days after an inspection disclosed loose concrete and a crack in a steel beam. The bridge remained open with lane restrictions, but Rialto was closed until repairs were made.</p>
<p>A. Mercante Contracting has a $1.1 million contract to replace everything but the concrete abutments —&nbsp;bridge beams, deck, sidewalks and railings. In addition, the metal stairs from the bridge to Rialto Street will be moved from one side of the bridge to the other so it meets directly with the sidewalk on Rialto.</p>
<p>“Everything from the abutments out will be new,” said Eric Setzler, the city’s chief engineer.&nbsp;“The abutments have some imperfections&nbsp;and the design may not be anything special, but they have a lot of life left in them.”</p>
<p>The bridge has had a lane restriction and a weight limit of 36 tons. Both will be eliminated when the project is completed.</p>
<p>Throughout the work, traffic on Lowrie Street will be detoured using Ley and Sundeman streets. Port Authority’s Route 4 Troy Hill will follow the detour.</p>
<p>Rialto also will be closed to vehicular traffic, with motorists detoured by using Troy Hill Road and Route 28.&nbsp;Pedestrians will continue to have access to Rialto Street, but some disruption will occur during bridge demolition.</p>
<p>Mr. Setzler said moving the metal steps from one side of the bridge to the other will increase safety since pedestrians no longer will have to cross Rialto to get to the sidewalk.&nbsp;</p>
