<p>People with backyard swimming pools are feeling pretty smart right now. They can enjoy all the splash with none of the social distancing during this coronavirus summer when many public pools are closed.</p>
<p>Not all pools are created equal, however. This very special one in Bell Acres comes with a resort-like estate that is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/Buying-Here/2020/06/19/Buying-Here-Bell-Acres-estate-pool-gym-squash/stories/202006210002" target="_blank">on the market for $3.25 million</a>. Considering there is at least a year’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2020/06/15/Pools-pandemic-COVID-19-Pittsburgh/stories/202006120043" target="_blank">waiting list for an in-ground pool</a>, maybe buying a house that already has one is the answer.</p>
<p>“When we bought it, the backyard was just a piece of grass with really nothing but grass,” said owner Rick Zomnir.</p>
<p>He and his wife, Heidi, transformed that empty green space in 2009 with&nbsp;a 60-by-30-foot saltwater pool that is fed by two smaller pools and&nbsp;sits on top of a hill overlooking wooded terrain. They also added a waterfall and a large patio with an outdoor fireplace.</p>
<p>“It’s really cool,” he said.</p>
<p>Made from a type of concrete known as gunite, the pool has plenty of room for laps, water polo or just floating on an inflatable raft. It became the centerpiece of family activities, Mr. Zomnir said, especially when it was new. Their children were in the sixth and eighth grades then and used it frequently with their friends.</p>
<p>“It was a great place to hang out in the summer,” he said.</p>
<p>Unlike many in-ground pools, there is no real deep end. It ranges from 3 to 5 feet deep and diving is not allowed.</p>
<p>“We wanted a pool where we could play games and catch football and have races,” Mr. Zomnir explained.</p>
<p>The pool later became a favorite of six grandchildren who visited often from Raleigh, N.C.</p>
<p>“We would make s’mores by the outdoor fireplace after a day of swimming,” he recalled.</p>
<p>The fireplace and waterfall add to the resort-like feel of the nearly 8-acre property. The top pond that feeds the waterfall is 3 feet deep; the holding pond at the bottom is much shallower, only 3 or 4 inches deep.</p>
<p>“The water coming down the waterfall is as clean as the water in the pool,” Mr. Zomnir said.</p>
<p>His grandchildren liked to cool off in both waterfall pools.&nbsp;“We would literally hang out there all day.”</p>
<p>The 22,000-square-foot house includes a gym with a half basketball court that opens to the patio by the pool. Basketball players could walk out sliding glass doors and jump in the pool.</p>
<p>“We did that a lot,” he admitted.</p>
<p>The property also includes a squash court, a sauna and a locker room with a double shower and six lockers.</p>
<p>“It’s a great place to be with kids if you have a big family,” Mr. Zomnir said.</p>
