<h1>GOP group opposed to Trump makes big ad buy in Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An NBA coach’s tearful speech about racial justice at a post-game press conference in Los Angeles will play out on televisions in Pittsburgh this week as part of a six-figure ad buy by a group of Republicans who oppose Donald Trump’s reelection.</p>
<p>The cable advertisement featuring Clippers coach Doc Rivers is backed by The Lincoln Project, a committee made up of longtime GOP strategists who are working to defeat Mr. Trump and his congressional “enablers” down the ballot in November.</p>
<p>The ad, titled “Doc,” shows pieces of Mr. Rivers’ remarks to the media last week in reaction to the police shooting of Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man, in Kenosha, Wis., on Aug. 23.</p>
<p>As the video flashes images of Mr. Trump and speakers at the recent Republican National Convention, Mr. Rivers lambastes the GOP for “spewing this fear” during their nominating event.</p>
<p>“We’re the ones getting killed,” Mr. Rivers says. “We’re the ones getting shot.”</p>
<p>“It’s amazing to me why we keep loving this country, and this country does not love us back,” he adds.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Project is running the ad in the Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Erie and Philadelphia TV markets with spending of more than $380,000. It started hitting the airwaves on Wednesday and will go through Friday, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has insisted that he has done “more for the African American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln,” and has cited his efforts in criminal justice and prison reform, and his administration’s funding of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. He’s also touted the low unemployment rate for African Americans — before COVID-19 hit.</p>
<p>But the president has also made “law and order” a main pillar of his battle for reelection, and has labeled Black Lives Matter a “Marxist organization” that is “bad for black people” and “bad for everybody” —&nbsp;at odds with the protest movement that has been predominantly Black in response to several high-profile deaths of Black people at the hands of white officers.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers has been critical of the president before, and has stood in defense of NBA players’ recent showing of unity around Black Lives Matter and the protest movement. In early August, after Mr. Trump said NBA players were “disgraceful” for kneeling during the national anthem, Mr. Rivers said, “Like, really, I don’t even care. We know that justice is on our side, right?”</p>
<p>“And this [VOTE] hat that I’m wearing is what our president is trying to get us to not do, which I think is just as disgraceful,” Mr. Rivers said, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Project has poured money into advertising across the country in an effort to oust pro-Trump Republicans and turn the tide against the president himself — whom committee leaders deem a routine violator of the Constitution.</p>
<p>“We have been, and remain, broadly conservative (or classically liberal) in our politics and outlooks,” its founders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/opinion/lincoln-project.html" target="_blank">wrote in the New York Times</a> late last year. “Our many policy differences with national Democrats remain, but our shared fidelity to the Constitution dictates a common effort.”</p>
<p>In this ad from the committee, Mr. Rivers questions how Republicans could dare to talk about fear when Black people are the ones who have to talk to their children about&nbsp;“being careful if you get pulled over” by police.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to be Black to be outraged,” Mr. Rivers says. “You need to be American and outraged.”</p>
