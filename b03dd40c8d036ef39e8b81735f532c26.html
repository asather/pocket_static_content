<h1>Former Aliquippa assistant police chief claims malicious prosecution</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former assistant police chief in Aliquippa has sued the city and its top officials along with the Beaver County district attorney and two county detectives, saying they all conspired to prosecute him in retaliation for reporting wrongdoing by the former police chief and other alleged misconduct inside the department.</p>
<p>Joseph Perciavalle III, an assistant chief and briefly the acting chief, had been charged in two cases with sending a sexually explicit text to a minor and illegally recording a conversation with former Police Chief Don Couch.</p>
<p>Both cases were based on cellphone evidence uncovered during a larger investigation of the still-unsolved murder of teacher Rachael DelTondo in May 2018. All of the charges were eventually either dismissed or dropped by prosecutors.</p>
<p>But Officer Perciavalle and his attorney, Joel Sansone, said he was the victim of a revenge plot by District Attorney David Lozier, Chief Couch, Aliquippa Mayor Dwan Walker and county Detectives Andrew Gall and Robert Heberle.</p>
<p>The suit raises numerous constitutional claims of retaliation, malicious prosecution and conspiracy.</p>
<p>Officer Perciavalle said he began to make "good faith complaints" about Chief Couch and the police department to Mr. Walker and city council members after he was promoted to assistant chief in 2014.</p>
<p>In 2016, according to the suit, he also made a complaint to Mr. Lozier and began sharing information with him over the following months. But in November 2018, Officer Perciavelle said in the suit, he sent a text to Mr. Lozier to which the district attorney replied "Who is this?"</p>
<p>After that, he said, Mr. Lozier "disengaged" with him and afterwards began conspiring with the two detectives to investigate him. Officer Perciavalle said all of the defendants are friends.</p>
<p>During the investigation of the murder, detectives in June 2018 searched the phone of Lauren Watkins, the 17-year-old daughter of an Aliquippa police sergeant and the last person to see Ms. DelTondo alive. On the phone, they found a group text sent by Officer Perciavalle the month before containing a video of a woman wearing no pants and urinating while on a swing.</p>
<p>On June 6, the day after the video was discovered, Chief Couch was removed as chief and placed on leave and Officer Perciavalle became acting chief. The next day, according to the suit, detectives obtained a search warrant for Officer Perciavalle's phone, which the suit says was overly broad.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, that search was done at the direction of Mr. Lozier "in retaliation for [Perciavalle's] good faith complaints to Walker and/or Lozier of ongoing wrongdoing" at the Aliquippa department.</p>
<p>The urination video was the basis for the sex-related charges, but Officer Parciavalle said in the suit that he had no intention of sending it to the girl and apologized to her father the next day. He said he also told the detectives that he had sent the video to the girl by mistake.</p>
<p>They charged him on June 8 and he was removed as acting chief.</p>
<p>The phone search also turned up a conversation he had secretly recorded with Chief Couch "during the course of his duly authorized investigation" of the chief and the department, according to the suit.</p>
<p>That recording was the basis of a second criminal case against him of felony interception of communications. But Officer Parciavalle said that the detectives and the district attorney should have known he was conducting an investigation of the department. Instead, he said, they "maliciously prosecuted the plaintiff without probable cause."</p>
<p>Officer Perciavalle said the mayor has refused to reinstate him and that he has suffered emotional and financial distress and a loss of reputation in the community.</p>
<p>The suit is seeking compensatory and punitive damages and other relief.</p>
<p>Mr. Lozier declined to comment on the suit.&nbsp;Mr. Walker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
