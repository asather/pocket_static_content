<h1>Sewickley Bridge to close for 24 days for preservation work</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Sewickley Bridge, which connects Moon with Sewickley Borough over the Ohio River, will close for nearly a month for preservation work beginning in July.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation on Tuesday said the bridge will close on July 17 for 24 consecutive days — through Aug. 10 —&nbsp;while workers with Swank Construction renovate the span’s deck overlay and replace the bearing and deck joints.</p>
<p>With the schedule, PennDOT said it hopes to “minimize traffic impact, improve safety and take advantage of lower traffic volumes.”</p>
<p>Single-lane alternating traffic will be in effect on the bridge from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day during the $3.69 million project.&nbsp;The overall project is expected to be completed in November, PennDOT said.</p>
