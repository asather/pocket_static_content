<p>Soon enough, Pitt football players will have company on campus.</p>
<p>The university’s athletic department announced Tuesday that it will welcome men’s and women’s basketball, men’s and women’s soccer and volleyball players back to campus on June 29 for a “phased return to voluntary offseason activities” amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>This news comes two weeks after Pat Narduzzi’s players returned on June 8.</p>
<p>Pitt’s June 29 return will mirror the football team’s, starting with a quarantine phase once players are back. Though Pitt’s release did not specify if the same length of time will be applied to basketball, soccer and volleyball, the football team’s quarantine was 14 days long, in keeping with post-travel recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Football players were scheduled to be medically evaluated between Days 8 and 14 of their quarantine period. Those symptomatic of COVID-19 were required to undergo nasal swab testing, as Jennifer Brown, Pitt’s senior associate athletic director for sports medicine, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/06/09/Pitt-football-COVID-19-return-to-campus-Pat-Narduzzi-NCAA-Oversight-Committee/stories/202006080108" target="_blank">told the Post-Gazette</a>&nbsp;two weeks ago. Narduzzi’s players also had the option to undergo testing even if they were asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Pitt’s release did not specify if the same testing protocols will be used for the incoming athletes. But it did confirm that other practices will be replicated.</p>
<p>Incoming athletes who are eventually cleared may then participate in the next phase of workout sessions. Like football, those workouts will be limited to 10 players and will be supervised by Pitt’s strength and training staff.</p>
<p>Basketball, soccer and volleyball players and coaches will also undergo “substantial education” on Pitt’s safety protocols. There will be “significantly enhanced” cleaning practices for all athletic facilities. Athletes and staffers will answer screening questionnaires and get their temperatures checked daily. Masks and other personal protective equipment will be utilized. And social distancing in meetings and workouts will be enforced.</p>
<p>In its release, Pitt noted that its offseason training model was formed using guidelines from local, national and international health agencies, as well as university health experts.</p>
<p>Pitt also reiterated that it will utilize a “staggered and phased return” to offseason participation for each of its 19 programs.</p>
<p>“We are excited to have our men’s and women’s basketball, men’s and women’s soccer and volleyball student-athletes returning to campus June 29,” Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke said in a statement. “We remain committed to our guiding principle — the health and well-being of our student-athletes and staff — as we continue to implement the campus return plan that we worked diligently with University leadership and medical experts to develop.”</p>
