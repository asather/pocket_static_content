<h1>Tree of Life seeks the healing power of stories </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Laurie Zittrain Eisenberg, a member of Tree of Life / Or L’Simcha Congregation, described herself as numb as she went from funeral to funeral, sitting shiva and mourning with her community in the days and weeks after the killings of 11 people in her Squirrel Hill synagogue on Oct. 27, 2018.</p>
<p>In an essay for the Association for Political and Legal Anthropology, she wrote of a path forward through the inspiration she got from the grassroots memorial that began to grow at a corner of Wilkins and Shady avenues.</p>
<p>She described it as "a point of pilgrimage."</p>
<p>"It was there that I found my place in this terrible saga, a sense of purpose, and something resembling a sense of peace."</p>
<p>Ms. Eisenberg, a professor of history and an expert on Middle East history at Carnegie Mellon University, put out a call for the stories behind the items on the <a href="http://www.treeoflifepgh.org/stories" target="_blank">Tree of Life's website</a>.</p>
<p>Those stories, and the healing powers they can convey, are still being sought.</p>
<p>"In all cases," she wrote on the website, "we are interested in knowing why donors chose the items they did, what messages they intended for victims’ families, survivors and visitors to the memorial, why they were motivated to contribute something more tangible than flowers, and how doing so made them feel."</p>
<p>There are many items that intrigued her, but one among them was a pair of glitter-gold high-top sneakers with rubber tips over the toes. On the right toe rubber was written the message “Shalom Aleichem, Salaam Aleikum” ("Peace Unto You" in Hebrew and Arabic, respectively) and on the left one, "Shalom Aleichem, Love and Light."</p>
<p>"The notes and messages were clear, but some, like those shoes, I totally don't understand. I would love to know that story,” she said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Other items included a marathon medal, a guitar, camp chairs, sports items, stuffed animals, and a nurse’s cross.</p>
<p>She said she learned that the marathon medal was left by a woman who finished the New York City Marathon later that autumn and wore a shirt during the race that read "Proud to be Jewish and from Pittsburgh."</p>
<p>"She said she ran the marathon on behalf of the community.”</p>
<p>Ms. Eisenberg said her community found comfort and strength in the outpouring of support and grief. The items, except for the thousands of flowers, have all been collected and will be documented by the Rauh Jewish Archives at the Heinz History Center.</p>
<p>Many of the items are mysterious in their intent, seemingly unconnected to the tragedy.</p>
<p>Jay Aronson, a colleague of Ms. Eisenberg's at Carnegie Mellon, has been studying the memorabilia of tragedy. He is an associate professor of Science, Technology, and Society and Director of the Center for Human Rights Science.</p>
<p>He said he was fascinated by the makeshift memorial at&nbsp; Tree of Life for how people interpreted their own grief and sadness through the items they made and left at the site.</p>
<p>"Ninety-nine-point-nine percent was what we call kitsch," he said, adding that the term is not meant to be derogatory. Teddy bears, homemade messages and artwork, painted rocks were among the items that he said are symbols, things that we understand and share to make sense of our grief.</p>
<p>These tens of thousands of artifacts of our collective sorrow have a powerful impact, said Eric Lidji, director of the Rauh archives.</p>
<p>He will be building a website to catalog all the items for the public to view in the coming year with part of a f<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/05/26/Tree-of-Life-Synagogue-Jewish-Community-Center-Rauh-Archives-AEAP-grants/stories/202005260113" target="_blank">ederal grant t</a>o Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assault on the synagogue was targeted, an anti-Semitic act of terror, and yet it resounded throughout the city, throughout the country and the world. The gifts to the congregation bear that out. Worldwide sorrow, focused on our city, had a strange effect. Everyone was gratified that the world responded, but many Pittsburghers struggled to believe such a thing could happen here.</p>
<p>Why not here? Shooters do horrific acts everywhere, or anywhere. It was a Pittsburgh awakening.</p>
<p>Having visited the grassroots shrine in the weeks after the shootings, I have often thought about those items. When Mr.&nbsp; Aronson mentioned the teddy bears as symbols, a thought kicked in. Teddy bears, in a sane world, are just cuddly things that children carry around.</p>
<p>Childhood is innocent, and it’s supposed to be safe, but when children need comfort, they might grab their teddy bears.</p>
<p>But the teddy bear cannot salve our emotional wounds. Our world is not sane. And I doubt that there is enough capacity for mental health intervention to make it so.</p>
