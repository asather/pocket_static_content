<h1>Mohawk beats Carlynton to earn first championship bid in school history</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A red and white banner hangs high inside the Mohawk High School gymnasium honoring the school’s 1970 boys basketball team that made a WPIAL championship appearance. That was a long 50 years ago, but even today, there still isn’t a girls basketball banner to match it — something this season’s Mohawk squad has used as motivation over the course of its dominant 2019-20 run.</p>
<p>The Warriors moved closer toward earning a banner of their own Wednesday, knocking off Carlynton, 64-58, in the 3A semifinals to advance to the WPIAL championship for the first time in school history.</p>
<p>“We’ve been talking about [the championship banner] all year,” said Mohawk coach Mike O’Lare.</p>
<p>And now, they have a chance to put that talk to action.</p>
<p>“We knew we had the potential to [earn a championship bid],” junior Paige Julian said. “We just knew we had to work every day. That’s what we do, we continue to do it every day.”</p>
<p>Julian accounted for over half of Mohawk’s scoring total, tallying 26 of her 33 points in the final two quarters as the Warriors staved off a late Carlynton comeback. She hit a trio of 3s and went 12 for 15 from the free throw line, while Nadia Lape finished with 17 points and Karly McCutcheon added seven.</p>
<p><strong>Other semifinal</strong></p>
<p>This season, matchups between section foes Beaver and Avonworth have been decided by the slimmest of margins. First came a two-point win for the Bobcats. Then came a three-point win for the Antelopes. So when round three of the series came Wednesday night, not a single possession could be taken for granted.</p>
<p>Nor a single free throw.</p>
<p>Beaver junior Emma Pavelek hit 11 of her 12 attempts at the charity stripe in a tight fourth quarter to push the Bobcats past Avonworth, 46-37, for the program’s second championship berth in the last three years. Pavelek finished with 25 points for the game, but it was her timely — and clutch — scoring down the stretch that ultimately mattered most.</p>
<p>“Every time I got fouled, I wasn’t even thinking about the shot per se,” Pavelek said after the game. “I was thinking more about that I couldn’t let my team down. I knew making those were going to be critical. In the back of my head, it was, ‘I can’t let my team down, I can’t let my team down.’”</p>
<p>Instead, she did the opposite.</p>
<p>“[If] she misses even a few of those, it’s a totally different game,” said Beaver coach Greg Huston. “... We do put a lot on Emma’s shoulders and expect a lot from her, but to be honest with you, she’s been doing that for the last two years.”</p>
