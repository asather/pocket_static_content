<h1>Pitt freshman guard Femi Odukale out indefinitely after breaking arm in moped accident</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt freshman guard Femi Odukale broke his arm in an accident over the weekend, an injury that will sideline him indefinitely, the school confirmed Wednesday.</p>
<p>Odukale was riding an electric moped in Pittsburgh when he collided with a car, a wreck that sent him to the hospital and required surgery.</p>
<p>While the procedure and his recovery from it will keep him away from basketball for the time being, he is expected to be ready to return at some point during the 2020-21 season, should there be one. Players had been on campus for weeks this summer for workouts, though they were given the opportunity to return home last week for some time off before the start of classes Wednesday.</p>
<p>Odukale’s accident and injury were first reported by Rivals.com.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-5, 185-pound Brooklyn native is part of a five-man freshman class at Pitt that ranked it among the top 30 schools nationally. Odukale, who committed to the program in March and signed with it in April, was rated as the No. 148 player in his class by Rivals and No. 176 by 247 Sports, with both outlets labeling him a three-star prospect.</p>
<p>“Femi displayed outstanding versatility, talent, toughness and competitiveness during an outstanding post-grad season,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said in a statement following Odukale’s signing. “We are excited to add him to our recruiting class and look forward to having him in our program. He is mentally and physically mature and will have an opportunity to come in and make an immediate impact next season.”</p>
<p>Though the length of his absence hasn’t been precisely determined, Odukale figured to vie for playing time in a Panthers backcourt featuring a number of new faces. It’s a group that has two-year starter Xavier Johnson and heralded Delaware transfer Ithiel Horton, as well as Nike Sibande, a transfer from Miami (Ohio) who is pushing for immediate eligibility for next season. Those additions will look to mitigate the losses of Trey McGowens and Ryan Murphy, both of whom transferred after averaging more than 24 minutes per game last season.</p>
<p>Should the Panthers choose to, they could also utilize longer, non-traditional lineups that feature wings like 6-foot-6 junior Au’Diese Toney, 6-foot-7 freshman William Jeffress and 6-foot-5 sophomore Gerald Drumgoole in positions away from the basket.</p>
<p>Odukale spent last season at Springfield Commonwealth Academy, a prep school in Massachusetts. There, he averaged 17.5 points, 8.2 rebounds, 8.8 assists and 2.7 steals per game while shooting 52% overall and 39% from 3-point range.</p>
