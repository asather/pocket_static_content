<h1>When to reopen schools: Officials have many factors to consider </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Like all educational institutions, the Pittsburgh Public School District is struggling with when to open the schools to full participation by students. The superintendent has not been able to give a firm date for the complete reopening. Families of students will have to deal with a bit more uncertainty before this is resolved.</p>
<p>Throughout the nation, parents and caregivers are wondering when children will be permitted to return to school. The rhythm of family life has been disrupted by the coronavirus, and many students are not benefiting fully from online education. The closing of schools has the potential to increase inequality in society because the so-called “digital divide” is real.</p>
<p>Many observers have said that schools should be the first public institutions to open, since child development is crucial to the future of the country. They point out that children are less likely than adults to catch the coronavirus, and kids are more likely to recover if they are infected. However, there is a related inflammatory disease that is affecting a small number of children and teens, and more information about this disease is needed.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Superintendent Anthony Hamlet has said he is preparing a wide range of options for the opening of schools in September. One scenario involves splitting student schedules so smaller numbers of students are in a building at one time. Another possibility is a combination of in-person and online instruction as a gradual reopening takes place. Wisely, Mr. Hamlet is seeking more details from the Pennsylvania Department of Education before making a final decision.</p>
<p>Seeing that schools are gradually opening in Germany and Denmark, among other countries, families are asking why that can’t happen here now. The answer is that conditions and risks vary greatly from place to place, and public health officials, not parents, should guide decision-making.</p>
<p>What is most needed at this time is patience while school officials weigh many factors, especially the safety of students and employees.</p>
