<h1>Allegheny County homicide detectives charge man for murder of woman in McKeesport</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County homicide detectives charged a man Thursday in connection to the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/04/26/Woman-shot-dead-McKeesport-Rogena-Street-Riverview-Avenue/stories/202004260110" target="_blank">murder of a woman who was found shot dead</a> in McKeesport in April.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gerald Walker, 37, of McKeesport is being accused of criminal homicide, according to court documents. Police filed charges of criminal homicide, persons to not possess, and carrying a firearm without a license, according to court documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On April 26, police received a call around 5:30 a.m. about reports of an unresponsive female found at the intersection of Rogena Street and Riverview Avenue, according to the criminal complaint. When officers arrived at the scene, they found Amber Dolby, 38, of Duquesne with a gunshot wound to the head. Authorities pronounced her dead at the scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On April 27, police conducted a scene search where they found one spent 9 mm cartridge casing with a head stamp “S&amp;B,” according to court documents.</p>
<p>During the course of the investigation, detectives learned the victim was known to frequent the Sunoco gas station at 600 Lysle Blvd. in McKeesport, according to the criminal complaint. Police say an officer had seen Ms. Dolby at the gas station in the early morning hours between 12-3 a.m. the day she was found shot to death. County police then obtained video surveillance footage from the gas station and saw Ms. Dolby standing in the corner of the gas station’s parking lot where a small blue hatch back sedan can be seen driving into the parking lot. Police say they believe Ms. Dolby hopped into the sedan based on audio footage of a car door opening and closing before the vehicle pulls out of the parking lot out of the camera’s view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detectives were able to match markings on the back of the sedan with footage of a car taken near the crime scene around 4 a.m. the day Ms. Dolby was found, according to a criminal complaint. Police were then able to use the license plate found on the surveillance footage to trace where the car was located, according to a criminal complaint. When police found the vehicle’s suspected owner — who was labeled as Witness #1 in the complaint — the witness told police the car legally belonged to their “former paramour,” and that they had been dating a man named Gerald Lamar Walker. The witness told police they fell asleep around 3:30 a.m., and that Walker must have taken the car.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When detectives interviewed Walker on April 26, Walker told police he never drove the car.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Aug. 4, detectives were granted a search warrant to search the iPhone found on Walker when he was first interviewed, according to the complaint. Detectives found images on the phone of Walker holding a black Glock firearm and handguns on a table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detectives then reinterviewed Walker on Aug. 10, according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police say Walker told police he drove to the Sunoco gas station “to buy blunts” and sold a $20 piece of crack to a female, whom police identified as Ms. Dolby, and agreed to give her a ride, according to the complaint. Police say Walker told police he dropped Ms. Dolby off near the cemetery and then drove back to witness #1’s sister’s house and fell asleep, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Walker denied killing Ms. Dolby but admitted he shot a gun earlier in the day on April 26 — stating he was with another person when shooting the gun, identified as witness #2, and said the guns belonged to them, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>On Sept. 14, detectives interviewed witness #2 at their residence, where they told police they owned the guns featured in the photos, according to the complaint. Witness #2 told police Walker would babysit their child and would have had access to their guns in their house, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>While detectives were in the process of retrieving witness #2’s Smith &amp; Wesson gun, they discovered it was stolen, according to the complaint. Detectives went through witness #2’s purchase records for the Smith &amp; Wesson and found they had purchased the gun along with a box of&nbsp;“S&amp;B” 9 mm ammunition, according to the complaint. Witness #2 then told police they had shot the gun at their godfather’s house in Tarentum in February and that there may still be casings in the woods, according to the complaint. Detectives then went to the house located at an address in West Deer and were able to recover 9 mm casings that had the head stamp&nbsp;“S&amp;B.”</p>
<p>Allegheny County Crime Lab scientists confirmed Thursday that the casings recovered during the search in West Deer matched the casings found at the crime scene, with the matching head stamp&nbsp;“S&amp;B,” which police say determines the casings were fired from the same handgun, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Police also checked Walker’s criminal history that showed Walker previously pleaded guilty to possessing with intent to deliver, deeming him a person not to possess a firearm, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Legal representation for Mr. Walker could not be found on court documents.</p>
