<h1>Coal tar driveway sealants banned in Fox Chapel</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Fox Chapel has become the first municipality in Pennsylvania to ban coal-tar based pavement sealants. The smelly black liquid is used to seal driveways, parking lots and in some cases, playground surfaces.</p>
<p>“It is toxic waste and should not be in our homes,” said council member Mandy Steele, a Democrat who said she ran for council last year on&nbsp;“an environmental advocacy platform.” She took office in January and spoke on Wednesday, which she noted is Earth Day.</p>
<p>Fox Chapel Council unanimously approved the ban on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contractors who do business in the North Hills suburb will be notified of the ban, she said, adding that&nbsp; “asphalt-based sealers are a much safer alternative.”</p>
<p>Several years ago, her family hired a contractor to seal cracks in their driveway. “The smell was horrific” she said, so she did some research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coal tar, a byproduct of the coal-making process, contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. “Some PAHs are considered to be cancer-causing chemicals,” according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Ms. Steele said she also researched the compound on websites maintained by&nbsp;the United States Geological Survey and <a href="https://coaltarfreeusa.com/bans-2/" target="_blank">Coal Tar Free America</a>, which reports that coal tar-based sealants are banned in Washington D.C. and the states of Texas, Wisconsin, New York, Washington, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts and Minnesota.</p>
<p>Ms. Steele is the mother of four children ages 2, 4, 6 and 8. The family also has three dogs. She said children and pets are especially vulnerable to environmental contaminants.</p>
<p>“Over time, coal tar releases PAHs into the air and is inhaled and flakes off into tiny particles that are tracked into our homes where they are ingested,” Ms. Steele wrote in a news release.&nbsp;“Stormwater washes the microscopic flakes into our streams” and impacts aquatic life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Steele said she had planned to speak about her concerns at government meetings in surrounding municipalities, but then all public meetings were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She plans to continue her campaign against coal tar-based sealants when things open up.</p>
<p>She said her family later had&nbsp;an asphalt-based sealer applied to their drivewayon top of the coal-tar based sealant.&nbsp;</p>
