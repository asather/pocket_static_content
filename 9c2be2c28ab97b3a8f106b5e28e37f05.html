<h1>Tony Norman: Keep your eyes on the prize, America</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Earlier this week, Joe Biden was interviewed by KDKA’s Jon Delano. Because Jon is a pro, he asked the question every journalist is supposed to ask the presumptive presidential nominee: What about Obama? — Michelle Obama, that is.</p>
<p>“I’d take her in a heartbeat,” Mr. Biden said. “She’s brilliant. She knows the way around. She is a really fine woman. The Obamas are great friends.”</p>
<p>Everything Mr. Biden said about Mrs. Obama is true except the first thing out of his mouth. Unless he has completely lost his mind, Mr. Biden would not take Mrs. Obama “in a heartbeat.” Name the last presidential candidate whose designated veep outshone the top of the ticket so dramatically?</p>
<p>Michelle Obama is, arguably, the most popular Democrat in the country — with only her husband, former president Barack Obama, giving her a run for her money. She’s a charismatic, if reluctant campaigner, a mesmerizing storyteller and a fearless human being who would follow her convictions over political expediency every time.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden told Mr. Delano what was expected of him. He’s grateful to black folks in South Carolina and throughout the South generally for resurrecting a campaign that had already been given the Last Rites after losing the first three Democratic presidential contests this year.</p>
<p>He knows he’s forever indebted to the Obamas for the opportunity and the bragging rights that came with being the vice president to the nation’s first black president.</p>
<p>Mindful of the excitement Mrs. Obama generates whenever her name is pitched as a possible running mate, Mr. Biden leaned in to the interview with Mr. Delano to offer a caveat about that dream ticket: “I don’t think she has any desire to live near the White House again,” he said solemnly.</p>
<p>It was his way of getting off a very uncomfortable hook. One look at a Biden-Obama 2020 ticket would have many Democrats howling about the lack of political symmetry and common sense it represented. Why shouldn’t Michelle Obama be on top of the ticket given her popularity with the base?</p>
<p>While she lacks Mr. Biden’s decades of experience in Congress, they were both in the Obama White House for eight years. There, Mrs. Obama had a far more intimate view of the machinations behind the scenes than Mr. Biden.</p>
<p>Reprising his role as the loyal veep would make more sense for Mr. Biden than trying to subordinate a far more dynamic personality of a black woman who has never run for office, but who represents the backbone of the Democratic party and its future.</p>
<p>Even if Mrs. Obama were interested in the veep slot, Mr. Biden wouldn’t be crazy enough to offer it to her. Neither would Bernie Sanders or any top-tier Democrat had they won the nomination over Mr. Biden. As an author who regularly filled stadiums and arenas during her book tour last year, Mrs. Obama would easily eclipse any Democrat who ran for president — and they all know it.</p>
<p>The one sure sign that Donald Trump fears someone is the degree to which he is willing to lie about them unprovoked. While throwing Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp under the bus for moving to open up businesses in the state this weekend, Mr. Trump took credit for his narrow election victory over Stacy Abrams in 2018.</p>
<p>“As you know …” Mr. Trump said, “I worked very hard for [Mr. Kemp’s] election; he beat their superstar [Ms. Abrams]. I think you can say I helped a lot. Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey — they all went in …” he said conjuring a scenario in which he took on three black media and cultural firebrands simultaneously.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Obama, unlike her husband, did not campaign for Ms. Abrams. Mr. Trump made that fact up knowing that the portion of his base that automatically recoils from any reference to the former first lady will allow their reptilian brains to wander into the fever swamps of racial resentment again.</p>
<p>While justified in fearing Mrs. Obama’s popularity, Mr. Trump would also welcome an opportunity to engage in the dark arts of racial stereotyping against a figure his most fervent followers already hate and resent.</p>
<p>The racist memes that dogged Mrs. Obama through most of her years in the White House would return, this time sub-tweeted by the president of the United States.</p>
<p>The problem for Mr. Trump is that Mrs. Obama is popular with the swing voters he needs. Suburban Republican white women voted Democratic in 2018 and 2019 rather than swallow their revulsion and vote for Mr. Trump again. He can’t afford to alienate and anger them so blatantly.</p>
<p>It doesn’t surprise me that Mr. Trump is picking fights with Mrs. Obama, the only female Democrat with name ID who has no interest in the job, but I am concerned that the speculation about who will occupy the veep spot will derail the momentum and enthusiasm the Democrats are currently generating.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden has committed to picking a female running mate, which is admirable, but he has not committed to limiting the list exclusively to women of color. This could become a flashpoint for those looking for something to become indignant about.</p>
<p>While Mr. Biden is seriously considering two African American women — California Sen. Kamala Harris and Ms. Abrams — he’s also looking at Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin.</p>
<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren isn’t a likely running mate since she would have to give up her seat in the U.S. Senate and risk the Republican governor appointing a conservative as her successor.</p>
<p>Many consider Mr. Biden’s willingness to run with a white woman or even a Latino woman a “slap in the face” to the black women who resurrected his campaign, but that underestimates the sophistication of the Democratic Party’s most reliable voters.</p>
<p>As welcome as the candidacy of a black female for vice president would be, black women voters are not hot-house flowers who will abandon the party if a white woman or a Hispanic gets the nod instead. In 2020, the name of the game is keeping the pre-election drama to a minimum and beating Mr. Trump decisively at the polls. Black women want to win, period!</p>
<p>Mrs. Obama has no interest in the job. The sooner Democratic elites stop pretending that her candidacy is even a remote possibility, the closer we’ll be to beating the current occupant of the White House. It makes no sense to go into one of the most important political seasons in our nation’s history harboring any illusions.&nbsp;As they used to say during the voter registration drives of the 1960s: “Keep your eyes on the prize.”</p>
