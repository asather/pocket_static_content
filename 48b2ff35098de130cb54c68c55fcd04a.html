<h1>Amid talk of N.J. curfew, Gov. Murphy recommends residents stay home from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday that the Garden State’s residents should not leave their homes between 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The only exceptions, according to the governor’s recommendation, would be emergency or essential travel.</p>
<p>While not an order under Murphy’s declaration of a state of emergency, the governor said he is “strongly discouraging non-essential travel.” The measure was announced during a joint conference call with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont.</p>
<p>The governors also jointly announced all movie theaters, gyms, and casinos in the three states will be ordered closed at 8 p.m. Monday and will remain closed until further notice. Also, bars and restaurants will only serve take-out food for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>“We want everybody home -- not out,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna get through this," he added. "We’re gonna get through this as one family.”</p>
<p>The governors are also banning all public gatherings of 50 people or more in all three states, mirroring a recommendation by the federal Centers for Disease Control on Sunday night.</p>
<p>The move comes after Murphy promised “more draconian steps” to fight the virus would be announced in the coming days and weeks during a Sunday radio interview -- including a statewide mandatory curfew.</p>
<p>“The curfew is probably, of the two, is probably the more immediate one under consideration," Murphy told WBLS on Sunday.</p>
<p>He also added state officials will “inevitably” shut down all of the state’s public schools.</p>
<p>On Monday, the mayor of New Jersey’s second largest city, Jersey City, said he had gotten no guidance on how the police should interpret Mr. Murphy’s curfew recommendation</p>
<p>“Some of this stuff, we’re going to try to learn on the job,” Mayor Steven Fulop said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Murphy said he was bothered to learn from friends over the weekend about Asbury Park’s overflowing pubs, not far from his Middletown home.</p>
<p>“I saw too many videos last night of packed bars, people passing bottles around, drinking from the same bottle,” the governor told reporters during a telephone briefing Sunday afternoon when asked about crowded restaurants and parks despite the pandemic.</p>
<p>Hoboken was the first city to enact a curfew.</p>
<p>Also, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, ordered all bars and restaurants to no longer allow food to be served inside the establishments -- only takeout is permitted.</p>
<p>“If a bar does not currently offer food, they will no longer be permitted to operate and are no longer permitted to serve alcohol, effective March 15,” Bhalla said in a statement Saturday. “According to (the Office of Emergency Management), any bar or restaurant establishment that currently offers food service will be permitted to conduct food takeout and food delivery service only.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere,&nbsp;New York City's mayor said Monday city officials were considering "everything" in terms of "curfew" or other possibilities.</p>
<p>"It will get a lot worse before it gets better," Bill de Blasio said.</p>
<p>Also on Monday,&nbsp;Murphy announced he’s mobilizing New Jersey’s National Guard to assist in the state’s effort to combat the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Murphy said during a news conference in Trenton that the Guard will “assist in our efforts in anyway necessary.”</p>
<p>He said that may include help with testing, distributing food to kids during school closings, and possibly converting buildings for self-quarantining.</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. Jemal Beale, the head of the state’s National Guard, said their “most likely missions” will be helping with logistics, transportation, traffic control, security, and using engineers to help bring any damaged facilities back online.</p>
<p>“Wish us luck,” Beale said. “And please wash your hands on a regular basis. And also practice social distancing.”</p>
<p>Also, Murphy on Monday night said a third person has died from the coronavirus in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The person who died was identified as a man in his 90s, who was being treated at Hackensack University Medical Center. Other information on the case was not released.</p>
