<h1>ManorCare nursing home in Ross reports surge of COVID-19 cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong><em>This story will be updated.</em></strong></p>
<p>Nearly 40 residents and at least nine employees at ManorCare nursing home in Ross have tested positive for the coronavirus as a surge of new cases emerges across Allegheny County.</p>
<p>ManorCare Health Services in North Hills — which houses around 200 licensed beds — reported 39 residents tested positive for COVID-19 as of Saturday and two have recovered. In addition to those residents and the nine employees, three residents and three employees are awaiting test results, according to a data chart on the company’s <a href="https://www.hcr-manorcare.com/media/9566/hcr-manorcare-snf-covid-data-8-1-20.pdf" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>A company spokeswoman said they began universal testing of residents and staff a month ago.</p>
<p>“We began June 29 and have repeated it five times, with the sixth time starting this week,” ManorCare spokeswoman Kelly Kessler said in an emailed statement. “We support this process so that we can identify, isolate the virus and treat patients as early as possible.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Department of Health press secretary Nate Wardle said a large number of test results out of Allegheny County was reported to the department on Friday, which included several weeks worth of backlogged results. Some results came from a long-term care facility, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He could not confirm if any of those cases were linked to ManorCare in North Hills, however.</p>
<p>The facility is one of 42 ManorCare locations across Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The nursing home network currently categorizes facilities using a three-tiered system to help mitigate the spread of the virus.&nbsp;Tier One means the location does not have any positive cases of COVID-19 or any pending tests;&nbsp;Tier Two means there are not any patients who have tested positive, but test results are pending; and&nbsp;Tier Three means there are positive cases.</p>
<p>At least three or more patients or staff have developed a new onset of&nbsp;respiratory symptoms within a 72-hour period at North Hills, the company reported.&nbsp;The Pennsylvania Department of Health last month reported less than five cases of the virus among residents and no deaths.</p>
<p>ManorCare’s Peters Township facility in Washington County has 22 positive cases of COVID-19 among residents and 11 employees have tested positive, the company’s website states. The Pittsburgh facility in Shadyside on Fifth Avenue — one of two locations in Shadyside —&nbsp;currently has three tests results pending for residents while 54 residents total have recovered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company website does not list any deaths, but at least 12 residents have died at the Fifth Avenue location since the pandemic began, according to state data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other Shadyside location on Negley Avenue currently has about four test results pending for residents while three residents tested positive recently. To date, 42 have recovered and eight employees have pending test results, the company’s website states.</p>
<p>The network said it is taking cautionary measures to prevent spread of the virus, including restriction of group activities, including communal dining and activity programming, consistent staffing assignments, and daily screenings&nbsp;of patients, staff and employees&nbsp;for signs and symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Authorized visitors and employees are screened daily for:</p>
<p>• Confirmation of a positive COVID-19 test</p>
<p>• Exposure to a positive COVID-19 case</p>
<p>• International travel</p>
<p>• Cruise ship travel</p>
<p>• Unexplained fever over 100 degrees within the last 14 days</p>
<p>• A diagnosis of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection of unexplained etiology in the last 14 days</p>
<p>• Any other possible signs and symptoms as identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
