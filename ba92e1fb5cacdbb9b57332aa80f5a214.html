<h1>Both GOP candidates pledge to deliver for House 39</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two years ago, Mike Puskaric told the people of the 39th state House district that Harrisburg had forgotten about them; that it had abandoned Elizabeth, ignored Jefferson Hills and had given them less in economic development grants than it had burdensome school property taxes.</p>
<p>Now, with a first term in the legislature behind him, Mr. Puskaric says he’s delivered on bringing development and infrastructure investment to the district and is working on delivering property tax reform, while his Republican primary opponent — Tom Kirsch — insists that Mr. Puskaric’s message from 2018 remains true today, and that he’s the one who can actually fix it.</p>
<p>It may sound like a doozy, but the race for the GOP nomination in the 39th — which extends from South Park and Bethel Park over to Elizabeth and down through Somerset in Washington County —&nbsp;centers on how much Mr. Puskaric has brought to the district, and whether someone like Mr. Kirsch can bring more.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirsch, a self-described business leader who resides in Bethel Park, said he feels the district is “underrepresented,” and needs someone who has the business experience to look out for families and small businesses, and corral more grant money.</p>
<p>But Mr. Puskaric, of Union, Washington County, counters by pointing to the more than $1.5 million in state grants he helped secure for projects including infrastructure improvements to downtown Elizabeth’s central business district, reconstruction of the RiverLift Barge Dock in Jefferson and traffic safety upgrades in South Park.</p>
<p>“What it comes down to is, we’re improving quality of life in the 39th district,” Mr. Puskaric said this week, insisting that he’s focused on trying to “make these towns that were laid out many, many years ago modern and more capable” for the 21st century and incentivize private investment.</p>
<p>For Mr. Kirsch, it’s about what he says he’s heard from some local officials: that they’ve received nothing from the state under Mr. Puskaric’s leadership. Of the downtown Elizabeth investment in particular, Mr. Kirsch deemed it a “wasted project” that would sacrifice a historical building for a parking lot that can only hold&nbsp;seven or eight vehicles.</p>
<p>Mr. Puskaric responded that off-street parking enables decision-makers to implement wider lanes for vehicular traffic, and that narrow lines and the lack of parking have held back the town’s business development for years.</p>
<p>“It speaks volumes that my opponent thinks making critical infrastructure investments on main street is a waste,” Mr. Puskaric said.</p>
<p>Asked where he’d direct investment, Mr. Kirsch said that “every one of the boroughs” needs infrastructure money.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirsch labels himself a&nbsp;“guy down the street trying to do what’s best” for families and businesses — a candidate who wouldn’t make empty promises and wouldn’t be a&nbsp;“career-minded, inexperienced politician.” He wouldn’t say if he considers his opponent career-minded, but said Mr. Puskaric — elected at 29 years old with a background working at a real estate closing settlement company —&nbsp;is&nbsp;“certainly inexperienced.”</p>
<p>As for Mr. Kirsch’s career, he said he put in more than three decades at some of Pittsburgh’s largest corporations, and that for many years, he was a leader for a real estate developer that built office buildings for the federal government. The company’s portfolio included 13 office buildings and several residential condominium properties, he said.</p>
<p>That experience, he said, make him better suited to fight for the taxpayers and stand up to tax increases.</p>
<p>One way he wants to do that is through a familiar proposal: a reform of the school property tax system. He said he’d reintroduce a bill that would give municipalities the authority to charge an additional 1% sales tax and earned income tax, with provisions that’d give tax credits to seniors, people on fixed incomes and first-time home buyers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Puskaric’s campaign literature says he&nbsp;“is working” to eliminate the property tax.</p>
<p>He said he’s been collaborating&nbsp;with his House colleagues to “crunch the numbers” and find a funding formula that will shift the tax burden and still fully fund education.</p>
<p>Mr. Puskaric said that to this point, they’ve&nbsp;“struggled” to find a funding formula, and noted that a big challenge is that a number of districts took on construction projects and have capital debts that are pending.</p>
<p>Facing the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Puskaric conceded, “We may have to start over and take another look at it.”</p>
<p>The winner of the Republican primary on June 2 will face Democrat Sara-Summer Oliphant in the general.</p>
