<h1>Steelers place James Washington, Jaylen Samuels on COVID-19 list; make 8 cuts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As training camp testing continues, the Steelers have placed two more players on the reserve/COVID-19 list, and both have been key weapons for the offense the past two seasons.</p>
<p>James Washington, the team’s leading returning receiver, and versatile running back Jaylen Samuels are the two most notable Steelers to draw the COVID-19 designation, which means they either tested positive for the virus or came in close contact with someone who tested positive. The team is not permitted to specify and did not for the two previous players placed on the list, cornerbacks Justin Layne and Arrion Springs.</p>
<p>In addition to the news on Washington and Samuels, both of whom will be sidelined indefinitely, the Steelers have released eight roster hopefuls: quarterback J.T. Barrett, running back Ralph Webb, receiver Quadree Henderson, offensive lineman Christian Montano, linebacker/long-snapper Christian Kuntz, defensive end Dewayne Hendrix, defensive tackle Josiah Coatney and safety Tyree Kinnel.</p>
<p>Barrett, Webb and Henderson finished last season on the practice squad but were long shots to make the active roster out of camp this year. Montano and Coatney were part of this year’s undrafted free agent class. Kuntz, Hendrix and Kinnel were signed after spending time in the XFL.</p>
<p>The roster moves of Washington and Samuels, combined with the cuts, brings the Steelers’ count to 79 ahead of the NFL’s deadline to reduce roster sizes to 80. According to an NFL Network report Thursday, the team also intends to sign Curtis Riley, a free safety who has been a part-time starter with the Giants and Raiders, but that move is not yet official.</p>
<p>Training camp began last week, but the first day of full-contact practice won’t be until Aug. 17. Washington and Samuels could be back by then if they clear the NFL protocols for the reserve list.</p>
