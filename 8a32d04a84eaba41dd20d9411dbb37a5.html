<h1>Pelosi to send impeachment articles next week </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will take steps next week to transmit the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, ending a three-week standoff but confronting the Senate with only the third trial in U.S. history to remove a chief executive.</p>
<p>In a letter to her Democratic colleagues, Ms. Pelosi said Friday she was proud of their ‘‘courage and patriotism” and warned that senators have a choice as they consider the charges of abuse and obstruction against the president.</p>
<p>“In an impeachment trial, every Senator takes an oath to do ‘impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws,’” Ms. Pelosi wrote. “Every Senator now faces a choice: to be loyal to the President or the Constitution.”</p>
<p>The trial could begin next week. The Constitution gives the House the sole power to impeach a president, but the Senate is given the ability to render a verdict when it convenes as the Court of Impeachment.</p>
<p>Ms. Pelosi was particularly upbeat Friday as she strode through the Capitol, despite the mounting pressure on her to quit delaying the trial. Her decision to end the showdown with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell does not fully bring closure to the question of whether the Senate will consider new witnesses, as some want, shifting pressure on senators to decide.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump swiftly signaled his intention of blocking any testimony from John Bolton, the brash former national security adviser who could be a wild-card witness. Mr. Bolton has said he would appear if subpoenaed.</p>
<p>At the same time, centrist GOP Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, whose vote is among those most watched, announced Friday she was in discussions with other Republicans on a strategy that would allow the Senate to hear new testimony.</p>
<p>While the rules of Senate trial remain unsettled, the outcome is not. Mr. Trump is widely expected to be acquitted of the charges that he abused power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, then obstructed Congress in its investigation.</p>
<p>No president has ever been removed by the Senate. Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were both acquitted; Richard Nixon was expected to be impeached and removed but resigned before either came to pass.</p>
<p>“Ridiculous,” Mr. Trump told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham about the speaker’s gambit. “Nancy Pelosi will go down as the least successful speaker of the House in the history of our nation.”</p>
<p>Asked if he would invoke executive privilege to block Mr. Bolton’s testimony, Mr. Trump said, “Well, I think you have to for the sake of the office.”</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell, who has been working closely with the White House on strategy, said Friday afternoon that the Senate is “anxious to get started.”</p>
<p>Republicans have the leverage, with a slim 53-47 Senate majority, if Mr. McConnell can keep GOP senators on board with his strategy. So far, they are supportive of modeling the trial after the one used in the last presidential impeachment, of Mr. Clinton, 20 years ago. It set out a path for starting the trial and voting on witnesses later.</p>
<p>Despite Mr. McConnell’s wishes for a speedy trial, some Republicans in his caucus have indicated they are open to witnesses. It takes just 51 senators to set the rules, and Democrats have been trying to win over wavering GOP senators to vote with them on hearing new testimony.</p>
<p>“I am hopeful that we can reach an agreement on how to proceed with the trial that will allow the opportunity for witnesses for both the House managers and the President’s counsel if they choose to do so,” Ms. Collins said. “It is important that both sides be treated fairly.”</p>
