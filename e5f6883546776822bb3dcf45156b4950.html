<h1>Virus fears hurting Pittsburgh's Asian restaurants, groups say</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>City officials and local organizations were set to discuss the economic effects of the COVID-19, especially for Asian- owned businesses, at a press conference Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Mike Chen, owner of Everyday Noodles and Night Market Gourmet, and former president of the Pittsburgh Chinese Restaurant Association, said they’re hoping the event will spread awareness that Asian people are not transmitters of the disease.</p>
<p>“We live in Pittsburgh and everybody should be facing [this] together,” he said Friday. “We are all in the same boat; everybody is fighting, and everyone is careful.”</p>
<p>Fear of contamination has apparently kept Pittsburghers away from Asian and Chinese restaurants and businesses. Many of the 90 Asian restaurants in the East End, including nearly 30 in Squirrel Hill, have experienced “dramatically lower revenue” due to fear surrounding COVID-19, according to a press release.</p>
<p>Marian Lien, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans, said restaurant owners are reporting that production has decreased anywhere from 20% to 50% since the first United States&nbsp; case of&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">COVID-19</span>&nbsp;six weeks ago.</p>
<p>Elected city officials, including Mayor Bill Peduto, and representatives of local organizations such as the Pittsburgh Chinese Restaurant Association and the Jewish Federation, were to speak at Friday’s event at Night Market Gourmet in Oakland.</p>
<p>On a shopping trip to the Strip District last Friday, Ms. Lien said she found Lotus Market “bare.”</p>
<p>“I could count on one hand how many people were there. On a Friday afternoon, that’s unheard of.”</p>
<p>Wholey’s Market, on the other hand, was “packed.”</p>
<p>At Maiku Sushi down the street, the owners said they hadn’t seen business this bad for decades, said Ms. Lien.</p>
<p>Ms. Lien said fears of the virus have negative economic effects beyond the Asian community, too. She said restaurants and businesses are buying less supplies, causing a “ripple effect” through the local community.</p>
<p>The Organization of Chinese Americans’ Pittsburgh Chapter and the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh are partnering with elected officials to combat the situation.</p>
<p>Josh Sayles, director of community relations for the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, said the Jewish community had an obligation to fight racism beyond anti-Semitism, according to a press release.</p>
