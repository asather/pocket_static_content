<h1>Keith C. Burris: Teachers and creeds </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When I was in sixth grade at Sacred Heart School in Coshocton, Ohio, about a thousand years ago, our teacher was Sister Macrina.</p>
<p>Sister Macrina played the guitar, as many young nuns did then. She was a Dominican and the sisters still wore the full habit. She ran a tight ship but she had a well-honed and wicked sense of humor.</p>
<p>Sister Macrina taught us to recite the Angelus at noon and think a silent Hail Mary if we heard a police or ambulance siren. If we got our work done and behaved — most days — she would read to us from the black stallion books of Walter Farley.</p>
<p>So she also taught us to appreciate good story telling.</p>
<p>I think of this great woman, and all she did for us, often.</p>
<p>I believe in teachers because of her.</p>
<p>When I was a junior in high school, Lola Miller was our English teacher. Mrs. Miller loved three things: Her family, hiking and being out in nature, and teaching American literature to young people. Her love of Whitman and Emily Dickinson, and moderns like William Carlos Williams, was equal to but not greater than her love of teaching and of youth. When her husband was briefly transferred to Michigan, she found herself without a teaching job. So she used to go to the local malt shop just to listen to the high school kids’ banter.</p>
<p>I believe in the life of the mind because of her.</p>
<p>When I was a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh, I would go to John W. Chapman’s house in Squirrel Hill for a seminar held in his living room. Everyone gave a paper, distributed to all, every week. If we got our work done, and behaved ourselves, we got sherry at half-time.</p>
<p>Dr. Chapman said, “You don’t know what you think until you have to write it.”</p>
<p>I believe in thinking and writing because of him.</p>
<p>I believe in distinctions and in civility because of him.</p>
<p>Neither is much understood, never mind respected, today.</p>
<p>I believe in kindness.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama said: “My religion is kindness.”</p>
<p>It is an imperative because of the inherent dignity of every single human being — endowed by his or her creator with “unalienable rights.” That was Jefferson’s credo.</p>
<p>A credo is a compass.</p>
<p>It is not a description of behavior. Few of us are 100% true to our credos.</p>
<p>But, if we take down the statue of the man who authored those words about unalienable rights, have we begun to dismantle our common credo?</p>
<p>Perhaps your compass is one great truth, as mercy is for Pope Francis. Isaiah Berlin would call you a hedgehog.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is several interwoven truths, like Berlin’s own conceptions of liberty and pluralism. You are a fox.</p>
<p>Which is the Dalai Lama? Which is Jefferson?</p>
<p>Years ago, I am told, there was a program on national television called “Credo.” The guest of the week had to look into a camera and, without props or prompting from a questioner, explain what he or she believed about why we are here and what it means to be human and what we ought to do about it — for, minus commercials, 30 minutes!</p>
<p>The show failed because because, well, the prospect is terrifying, isn’t it?</p>
<p>The average TV interview today is three minutes. And who among us, including august public figures, could fill even that?</p>
<p>I know that one politician did “Credo” — Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy.</p>
<p>He was also the only member of Congress willing to debate Joe McCarthy, on the air, at the peak of the latter’s power.</p>
<p>I believe in courage.</p>
<p>Christians say the Apostles’ Creed when they worship.</p>
<p>A friend said: The only words I am sure of are the first four: “I believe in God ...”</p>
<p>That was honest. He had courage.</p>
<p>Great teachers do not issue credos. They make it possible for their students to mold their own.</p>
<p>I have been re-reading Daniel Patrick Moynihan lately and watching some of his old interviews. I am looking at some of his book titles now: “Loyalties,” “Family and Nation,” “On the Law of Nations,” “Counting our Blessings.” Moynihan was a fox, and a teacher. His existence as a politician would be impossible today.</p>
<p>Moynihan saw government as, overwhelmingly, a force for good. It had been for him. Government gave him a good public school education, a free higher education at City College of New York, free grad school thanks to the GI Bill, and a Fulbright to see Europe. It was only natural, after that, he said, to pursue government service — one of the “highest callings” there is. And the Senate is the pinnacle of that high calling.</p>
<p>I believe in service.</p>
<p>Pat Moynihan said this wise thing: Liberals are interested in making things better. Conservatives strive to prevent things from getting worse. We need both.</p>
<p>Moynihan was a liberal, but it’s awfully easy, he said, to see how quickly things can fall apart.</p>
<p>I believe in the liberalism of Berlin, and Moynihan, and Reinhold Niebuhr. The liberalism of tolerance and free speech and thought and due process. The liberalism of the quest for justice.</p>
<p>But also in the conservatism of Burke, and Eisenhower and T.S. Eliot. The conservatism that wants to save and preserve all that is tested, beautiful and true <em>and </em>all that has nobly failed and is no longer thought beautiful, but is nonetheless true: The conservatism of memory and limits.</p>
