<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 06.22.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi everyone, hope you had a nice weekend. Anything Steelers-related on your mind? Have at it.</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: Kaepernick hasn't played in 4 years. Does anyone know if he's stayed in Football shape and has been working out during his time off? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That, to me, is the biggest question. Even more so than a potential distraction off the field, it's can he still play? But it's not as if he's been completely underground. Remember he had that workout for teams last year that became a bit of a mess when his camp wanted it to not be as private as the NFL intended. So, in theory, the decision-makers in the league should have a decent idea of his baseline level of conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Hi Brian...might the Steelers have any interest in trading for the Jets’ Jamal Adams? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Any team would love to have Jamal Adams, I would think, but I wouldn't look for the Steelers to seriously pursue it. One, because your safety tandem of Minkah Fitzpatrick and Terrell Edmunds is young with first-round pedigree. Two, because whoever acquires Adams is going to have to be ready to give him a huge contract at some point, and the Steelers likely can't afford to earmark a whole lotta money for another star like that.</p>
<p><strong>ALB</strong>: Brian, given the recent comments by Dr. Fauci and coaches Harbaugh and McVay, along with the spread of the virus among players in the various sports training together, do you think the NFL may be being way too optimistic, way too early about having a season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't know that I'd call it optimistic, but they've certainly just tried as hard as possible to simply proceed as normal without making any major postponements or cancellations. At least not to the stuff that matters. Has that given fans a false sense of hope? Maybe. But still, it's hard for me to imagine the NFL, the granddaddy of them all, not figuring out a way to make this season work, whether it's a good idea or not.</p>
<p><strong>Picksixlisberger</strong>: Opening game 2022 season, who’s the starting quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well let's see, I don't think it will be Benjamin Roethlisberger. Nor do I think it will be Mason Rudolph. Maybe some guy we haven't even heard of yet? A veteran who's currently on another team? Thinking of some of the top college QBs who are more than a year away from entering the draft ... how about Kedon Slovis from USC?</p>
<p><strong>Turk in MD</strong>: Hi Brian. Happy Fathers Day. Alualu has been discussed as the most likely NT when they play the 3-4. Like Wormly, Alualu is better suited as a rotational DE/DT. 25% of snaps is still every 4th play. It’s an important position. Does the NT continue to play a 2-gap technique or will the 3-4 have to evolve with the personnel on the roster? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thanks, Turk. As a first-timer, I enjoyed it. As for your question, I think it's more likely the Steelers find a nose who can do what they need them to in their defense than evolve to their personnel. Now, I think you could see them play even less 3-4, but that doesn't exactly solve your issues at inside linebacker, either. It'll be interesting to see whether Tyson Alualu, Dan McCullers or perhaps even a youngster like Isaiah Buggs ultimately wins that NT job.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Steeler</strong>: Brian, is James Conner in good physical shape with all his injuries behind him ? The Steelers will need him to compete in the AFC North. Go Steelers. Thanks for your chats. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He sure looks like it. Don't get me wrong, I've seen folks on Twitter saying he looks more like someone trying to become a model or a bodybuilder than a sturdy NFL running back, and I think even James Conner himself has acknowledged that even his most sculpted physique has been criticized. For him, he's had bad injury luck paired with a pretty contact-heavy running style. Something's gotta give in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Hi Brian have you had a chance to read James Conner’s book? I recommend it and after reading it what an incredible young man he is. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I have not read it yet, but thanks for the insight, Gene. His story has been told often over the years, from Pitt to the Steelers, but now he's telling it himself. And his career is still young, so hopefully for him he still has many chapters let.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Have the Steelers trade Terrell Edmunds and a second rd pick for Jamal Adams? Could you imagine that secondary? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That'd be an all-time safety tandem, at least on paper. But rumor has it the Jets were asking for a first and third-round pick from the Cowboys in exchange for Adams, so not sure Edmunds and a second would get the job done.</p>
<p><strong>Buzz</strong>: Outside of Inside Linebacker, the Steelers look pretty strong. Their biggest issue will be to keep this group intact. Ben's money hurts the big picture. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It does, but also, having him as your quarterback might be the most important factor in the big picture. I'd argue that the devil you know is better than you devil you don't, for lack of a less sinister phrase.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: What is the difference between a mauler and a road grader, if any? Could a dancing bear play guard, or are they relegated to the tackle position? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Maulers tend to be smaller than road graders. Dancing bears are even better as defensive linemen. Heat-seeking missiles at safety are ideal.</p>
<p><strong>DaquidoBazzini</strong>: I don't feel confident at all about the 2020 NFL season being played (at least not more than a couple games before the coronavirus roof caves in). Any idea if players would be paid for the whole season?....Or is that a detail that would need to be worked out? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: From what I understand, any situation like that would basically turn into a knock-down drag-out fight between the NFL and the NFLPA. And I tend to think the league and its owners would be more likely to fold, because the union has more leverage given the language in the CBA. Would there be additional details they'd probably have to look into? Sure. But no use causing a bunch of bad blood on both sides just to recoup the cash from one lost season.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Brian, it seems Covid may negatively affect college football more so compared to other pro football and other sports. If the college football season is cancelled, what effect will that have on the next NFL draft? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Who knows? The whole thing will be even more of a mess than this year's for teams, and college players who put out good tape in 2019 will have a major advantage. NFL franchises would just have to do their best to make educated guesses on prospects (even more so than usual).</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: Are you using a picture with Berry just to try and trigger people? If so, thank you. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'm not sure. Sports editor/podcast producer Ryan Winn chose that photo. Maybe he's just trying to elicit more punter questions. Those are my fav.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph</strong>: Have the Steelers signed any draft choices, has any team for that matter, signed their draft choices? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They have not, and most other teams are in the same boat, Ralph. Tua Tagovialoa is the biggest name to have inked his deal already. Only a few teams haven't let the COVID-19 aspect stop them from signing their rookies.</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong>: In a recent interview, it appeared that Cam Heyward was having reservations about playing this season because of the virus. Have you heard anything about this and are other players expressing similar thoughts? Thanks. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think with Cam and most other players, especially the veterans, the concern is more about just making sure the NFL goes about this the right way and for the right reasons. Those like Cam with families and young children have every right to make sure they're armed with the information they need to make decisions while we're still in a pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Buster</strong>: Brian, stadiums don’t last as long as they used to. Have you ever seen or heard anything about the predicted life expectancy of Heinz Field? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not particularly. The P-G has written quite a bit over the years though about the tug of war between the Steelers and the Stadium and Exhibition Authority when it comes to their home venue. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2019/09/11/Pittsburgh-Steelers-Heinz-Field-FedEx-Great-Hall-North-Shore-SEA-expansion/stories/201909120063" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2019/09/11/Pittsburg...</a></p>
<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Better front office draft day move? Moving up considerably in first round to select Troy or trade with Rams for The Bus? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Give me Troy Polamalu on that one, Tim.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: I see Josh Gordon has once again applied for reinstatement. Why does the league seem willing to give him more chances than other problem players? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't know that it does. But individual teams continue to give him chances because when he's right, he can really play.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: I just cancelled my DirecTV package. I will watch whatever game is televised from now on. Sure NFL will be just fine. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Paul, I agree with you.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: Do you remember way back when instead of saying a receiver got "separation" they just got open? Good times. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Now we're wading into Gene Collier's Trite Trophy territory. This year, he might be able to do an all-coronavirus edition. Between social distancing, quarantining, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Steeltowntim@aol.com</strong>: Steeler's starting QB 2022 will be a freshman in college this year who wont get to play. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: So then we've definitely never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>ALB</strong>: If the NFL would start the season, but have to abandon it after a few games because of the virus, would you expect players’ stats to count? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hmmm never really thought about that one. Probably not, but I'm willing to consult both the AAF and XFL on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Turk in MD</strong>: Hi Brian, if the league really wants to give Kaepernick a fair chance to rejoin the league, what do you think about extending a roster exemption to the team that signs him? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Interesting idea, though I imagine that would open a can of worms. No one got an exemption for a trailblazer like Michael Sam. Then again, teams get a practice squad exemption for guys like Christian Scotland-Wiliamson who are in the foreign players program. No such exemption if they promote him to the active roster, though. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: OK everyone we're out of time. And next week at this time, I'll be out of town. That means no Monday chat. Be good in my absence, and have a nice (two) week(s).</p>
