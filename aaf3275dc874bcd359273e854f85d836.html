<h1>Pirates preach safety over attendance amid COVID-19 concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — COVID-19, the newly discovered coronavirus, continues to be a topic around the sports world.</p>
<p>On Friday, a Division III men’s basketball tournament game at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore was played in an empty gym. The game is the first known incident of an American sporting event being played without fans because of COVID-19, for which there have been more than 300 reported cases in the U.S., according to the New York Times.</p>
<p>Later that day, news started to come out about the NBA telling teams and players to prepare for the possibility of holding contests without fans or media in attendance.</p>
<p>LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers spoke out and said he didn’t want to play in games without the fans. Pirates pitcher Jameson Taillon understood the sentiment from James but also believes that caution is essential.</p>
<p>“It sounds cliche, but you have to follow whatever medical advice you get from the trainers and doctors,” Taillon said before the Pirates’ spring training game against the New York Yankees on Saturday. “I agree with LeBron — as players we play for the fans. Without the fans, we’re nothing. At the same time, if it’s a couple of weeks playing without fans to make sure everyone stays safe, then I’m all about that.”</p>
<p>Bryan Reynolds has a bit of experience playing in an empty big-league park going back to his days at Vanderbilt University. Of course, those circumstances were different.</p>
<p>“We played at Dodger Stadium against TCU. It was quite weird. Eerie. Quiet,” Reynolds said. “It was strange how you were able to hear all the sounds. It was so quiet. We were used to playing at these loud SEC ballparks. It was harder than usual to get up for the game with no fans there.”</p>
<p>Baseball players probably have more experience than other athletes playing games in (nearly) empty ballparks. Before they become major leaguers, they often have contests at lowly attended games in the minor leagues. Once you get to the show, the fans are part of the game.</p>
<p>“I enjoy the fans; they make the game fun. They bring a lot of the vibe and excitement,” Newman said. “It’d be so strange to play a game without them there. I hope it doesn’t come down to that.”</p>
<p>MLB has already sent out a set of protocols for players to follow amid COVID-19 concerns. The Pirates took the extra step of deep cleaning their Bradenton facility after there was a case discovered in Manatee County as well as nearby Hillsborough County earlier in the week. Part of those protocols includes limiting high-fives with patrons and not signing autographs with pens from attendees.</p>
<p>“It’s tough,” Newman said. “I appreciate any fan that wants my autograph. But right now we can’t risk it until we figure out what’s going on. It’s hard because I see the excitement from fans when their favorite player gives them a few moments of their time.”</p>
<p>Newman also is taking another extra step in games.</p>
<p>“I don’t lick my fingers anymore,” Newman said. “I try to be highly aware of it while I’m playing because I used to do it all the time. I make sure not to touch my face and regularly am washing my hands.”</p>
<p>Taillon knows it would be unconventional to play with a genuinely empty ballpark. And before you make your PNC Park attendance joke, even having a crowd of 10,310 is a far cry from not having a single fan in the house.</p>
<p>“It would be interesting to hear every little thing that happens,” Taillon said. “It’d be different, but once a big-time hitter like Anthony Rizzo or Mike Trout steps in the box, they’re trying to beat me. The competitive juices take over from there.”</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>Erik Gonzalez was set to play in his second game at third base on Saturday as he returns from a foot fracture. Colin Moran is most likely going be the starting third baseman when the season opens in less than three weeks in Tampa. However, Moran played first base against Toronto on Friday and also hit a home run in the game. Philip Evans played second and third base on Friday.</p>
<p>Pirate manager Derek Shelton expects Moran to play some first even though he’s the starting third baseman. The goal is for Moran and other players to give the roster as much flexibility as possible.</p>
<p>“We are trying to get different views, different looks on the field. There will probably be a time where Colin starts at first and goes to third or starts at third then goes to first,” Shelton said. “We are trying different ways to think about it to get guys different looks. The big thing, personally, is I don’t want them to be surprised if they have to switch positions in a game.</p>
<p>“If that is the case, that’s something that’s on me, and I don’t want someone to be unprepared.”</p>
<p>Jose Osuna mostly plays the corner infield positions as a utilityman, but he played right field Friday. Cole Tucker has spent time at second base as well.</p>
<p><strong>About that grievance...</strong></p>
<p>We’ve gotten a few questions on the topic of the MLB Players’ Association and its grievance against the Pirates. We’ll try to answer those as best as we can.</p>
<p>First, there isn’t a second grievance against the Pirates as some outlets have reported. Union chief Tony Clark and the MLBPA filed an amended claim against the Pirates, along with Tampa Bay and Miami, and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2018/02/27/mlb-players-union-grievance-pirates-revenue-sharing-marlins-rays-athletics/stories/201802270106" target="_blank">the original complaint,</a>&nbsp;which looked into the 2017-18 offseason and was filed in 2018, is still awaiting a hearing date.</p>
<p>There is no public record of how much money the Pirates and other teams receive in revenue sharing. The union’s concern is that the collective bargaining agreement requires organizations to use revenue-sharing money to improve their on-the-field product. The union feels the Pirates aren’t, and player payroll is an easy place to point out a deficiency in spending.</p>
<p>According to Cots Contracts, the Pirates are going to have the lowest projected payroll in baseball at around $57 million when the season starts.&nbsp;The Pirates; argument is that payroll isn’t the only way to make the team better. They’ll point to their facility in the Dominican Republic, for instance, as an example. The team would argue money is being spent on technology, the draft and international signings.</p>
<p><strong>Where will this go?</strong></p>
<p>That’s the hardest question to answer. At some point, there will have to be either a hearing or an agreement to drop the complaint. If that hearing happens, the Pirates will have to give an account of how revenue-sharing money was spent. If they can, then this dies. If they cannot, things will get interesting, especially heading into negotiations for a new CBA in 2021.</p>
