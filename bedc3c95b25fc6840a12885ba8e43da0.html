<h1>Peduto administration unveils 20-year citywide land use plan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What does the city envision for growth over the next two decades? The answer: Driving development in the direction of equity by seeking what residents in all 90 neighborhoods want, according to the plan unveiled by Mayor Bill Peduto and City Planning on Tuesday.</p>
<p>As part of the new citywide ForgingPGH Comprehensive Plan, the administration will collect resident feedback for 12 months before developing policies and zoning regulations that will guide the city’s economic development for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto called the plan a&nbsp;“historical marker” and&nbsp;“absolutely necessary for the Pittsburgh we’re at today.”</p>
<p>“We approached this kind of planning back in the 1920s, and we did it again in the 1960s, and part of the reason I think that we haven’t really looked holistically, especially at land use neighborhood by neighborhood, is because during the 1980s, 1990s, beginning of the 2000s, there wasn’t much investment happening. We were playing defense. We were trying to save our city,” Mr.Peduto said.</p>
<p>The story is different now, he said, noting that Pittsburgh is among the top real estate markets in the U.S.</p>
<p>“Investment is happening all over the city,” he said.&nbsp;“We can choose to continue to play the defensive model of urban planning where we wait for a developer to come into a neighborhood with a plan ... or we can change, and we can change the way we do urban planning in the city of Pittsburgh. We can play offense.”</p>
<p>The plan -—18 months in the making -— will take into account housing, businesses, storm water issues and other environmental and equitable factors, according to planning officials.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;“Conditions and Trends” <a href="https://forgingpgh.org/building-our-plan/conditions-and-trends-report/" target="_blank">report</a> released simultaneously with the land use plan divides the analysis of development according to people, planet, place and performance — what the administration refers to as the&nbsp;“4Ps” framework.</p>
<p>The report lists a history of redlining, racial segregation, uneven development across neighborhoods and poor air quality as challenges, and cites the September 2019 <a href="https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7109_Pittsburgh's_Inequality_Across_Gender_and_Race_09_18_19.pdf" target="_blank">Gender Equity Commission study</a>&nbsp;that found Black individuals experience poorer health and economic outcomes in Pittsburgh compared to other similar U.S. cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “4P” model will “breakaway from generations of disinvestment in our Black communities,” Mr. Peduto said.</p>
<p>The report highlights planned investment in the city’s neighborhood parks — though the parks tax narrowly passed by voters in November <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/08/24/Pittsburgh-City-Council-referendum-parks-tax-half-mill-raise-City-Council-pandemic/stories/202008210023" target="_blank">remains stalled in City Council</a>.</p>
<p>The administration plans to work&nbsp;“hand-in-hand” with the Urban Redevelopment Authority, the city’s Housing Authority and registered community organizations, said Andrew Dash, City Planning director.</p>
<p>Two requests for proposals will be released this week seeking consultants to assist the city in updating the 2015 housing needs assessment and to develop economic development strategies.&nbsp; The city is looking to spend roughly $100,000 for each, Mr. Dash said.</p>
<p>Residents can find online public workshops, upcoming informational open houses and other information on the plan at&nbsp;<a href="https://forgingpgh.org/get-involved/" target="_blank">forgingpgh.org/get-involved</a>.</p>
