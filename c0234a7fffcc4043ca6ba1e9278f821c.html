<h1>People with disabilities sue Kennywood, Sandcastle and Idlewild over mask policy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The parents of three children with disabilities, along with an adult diagnosed with anxiety, have sued Kennywood, Sandcastle waterpark and Idlewild over the amusement parks' COVID-19 mask policy, saying they can't wear masks because of their medical conditions.</p>
<p>Attorney Thomas Anderson, who has brought many <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/18/Giant-Eagle-facing-federal-lawsuits-mask-policy-Americans-Disabilities-Act-ADA-courts/stories/202006180153" target="_blank">similar lawsuits against Giant Eagle</a>, filed the suit Friday in U.S. District Court under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs are Janine Wood of Bolivar, Westmoreland County, Jackie Webber of Kennedy, Lisa Mazzoni of Irwin and Ryan Walsh of Verona.</p>
<p>Ms. Wood and Ms. Webber are parents of children with autism, Ms. Mazzoni has muscular dystrophy and is the parent of an autistic child, and Mr. Walsh has a medical excuse from his doctor for anxiety and breathing problems. Ms. Wood also has physical and mental conditions that compromise her respiratory system, the complaint says.</p>
<p>The amusement parks require everyone who visits (except for children under 3 years old)&nbsp;to wear a mask with no exceptions for medical conditions, according to the suit.</p>
<p>All of the plaintiffs have been denied access to the parks in violation of the ADA, the suit says.</p>
<p>Kennywood said its policy is not to comment on litigation.</p>
<p>The parks reopened Friday to season pass-holders after delaying the start of its summer season by two months due to the pandemic. A full reopening is planned for Monday.</p>
<p>The parks have instituted other safety measures, including limiting the parksâ€™ capacity and temperature checks at the park entrance. Anyone with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher or who shows COVID-19 symptoms will be denied entry.&nbsp;Other changes include requiring visitors to register for their visit after buying a ticket.&nbsp;</p>
