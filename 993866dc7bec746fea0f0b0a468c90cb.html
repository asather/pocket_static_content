<h1>Split in Washington over abandoned mine reclamation fund pits Wyoming industry against Pennsylvania scars</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON — For decades, Reed Johnson has been calling attention to roughly 100 acres of scars on and around his Clearfield County property. Beginning in the 1890s, miners dug clay to form refractory bricks for kilns that helped to produce the Pittsburgh steel that fed American war victories.</p>
<p>The feverish pursuit of victory left behind heaps of discarded earth and unmarketable coal, causing acid mine drainage into the headwaters of a major tributary of the Susquehanna River.</p>
<p>“You’ve got over 15 miles of pristine stream that flows into the Susquehanna that was virtually dead — all because of the pollution coming out of this property,”&nbsp;Mr. Johnson said in a telephone interview.&nbsp;“For many, many, many years, I have tried to get something done.”</p>
<p>Whether the funds exist to finally clean up the mess and restore the local streams likely will hinge on the outcome of a debate in Washington over the renewal of a federal program that funds such projects.</p>
<p>The Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Trust Fund was created in 1977 to help states and tribes to restore long-defunct mine sites that have no existing responsible owner.</p>
<p>The fund&nbsp;is filled with fees assessed on coal companies for every ton of coal produced. It is the central source of money to jump start projects that can range in cost from $500,000 to as much as $15 million for large-scale&nbsp;water treatment plants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the fund set to expire&nbsp;in September 2021, Congress is now considering competing proposals that have&nbsp;pitted a bipartisan group of House lawmakers from Pennsylvania, who support extending the fund at current fee rates, against senators from Wyoming, who support a much shorter renewal and cutting the rates by 35%.</p>
<p>The split has highlighted the different regional views on mining between Appalachian states like Pennsylvania, which has the most reclamation needs in the country, and Western states like Wyoming, which is today the coal mining hub of the nation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have this intense need that is still out there,” said Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Centre, whose district in north-central Pennsylvania includes the most abandoned mine lands in the country.&nbsp;“Why would we cut that program?”</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson — along with nearly all other Pennsylvania lawmakers — signed onto a measure sponsored by Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Lackawanna, that would extend the fund another 15 years, until 2036.</p>
<p>It would maintain the current fee rates of 28 cents per ton for surface mined coal and and 12 cents a ton for underground mined coal. (That translates to about $3 million in fees assessed on Consol Energy, the Cecil coal company whose underground mines produced 27 million tons in 2019.)</p>
<p>Wyoming’s Republican senators, John Barrasso and Mike Enzi, view the fund as a burden for coal producers.</p>
<p>Last month, they introduced a proposal to scale back the fees and reauthorize the fund for seven years, leaning on the fund’s current non-allocated balance of $2.2 billion. Their bill also orders the U.S. Department of Interior&nbsp;to identify cost savings and determines the ratio of overhead to amounts spent on reclamation projects.</p>
<p>The National Mining Association, the trade group representing the industry, cheered the senators’ legislation, while withholding support from Mr. Cartwright’s bill. The trade group pointed to a 1991&nbsp;<a href="/%20https:/www.gao.gov/products/144682" target="_blank">General Accounting Office report</a> that found 28% of the reclamation dollars were spent on administrative expenses.</p>
<p>Last week, Laura Mengelkamp, a spokeswoman for Mr. Barrasso, said the fee cuts are necessary to provide “limited relief to coal producers that have been hit hard by declining demand for coal and the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p>
<p>Since the fee was last reauthorized in 2006, she pointed out, coal production has fallen by 57% as U.S. power plants have switched to burning natural gas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mine land reclamation projects “depend on coal production, and this measure of relief will help ensure the financial health of operators paying into the fund,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not the first time Wyoming lawmakers have clashed with those from Pennsylvania and the surrounding Appalachian states over the mining program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A plan to backstop ailing union coal miner pensions with payments from the reclamation trust fund was pushed by Democrats and Republicans mostly from Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and other Eastern states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the plan faced <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/06/02/Retired-coal-miners-pension-fund-congress-union/stories/201906020048" target="_blank">resistance from Mr. Enzi,</a> who viewed the move as a “bailout” for one pension plan while so many others are hurting, according to his spokeswoman in a statement last summer. Not one Wyoming lawmaker in the House or Senate signed on to the idea, which ended up passing as part of a spending bill last December.</p>
<p>Lawmakers like Mr. Thompson argue shorter extension could doom proposed clean-up sites like Mr. Johnson’s property, which Mr. Thompson recently toured.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania officials have inventoried over 287,000 acres of land and 5,500 miles of streams in need of reclamation, with estimated costs exceeding $5 billion, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Since 1980, state officials have paid for just 12% of the cost of the problem areas, the agency reported.</p>
<p><strong>A top priority</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Johnson’s property has been identified by watershed experts as a top priority.</p>
<p>“I don’t think just reauthorizing seven years for projects of that scope and size is going to provide the certainty it would take for all the partners to step up,” Mr. Thompson said.</p>
<p>Kelly Williams,&nbsp;watershed specialist for the Clearfield County Conservation District, said local engineers were just beginning to design the fixes, estimated at $8.1 million. Crews would have to remove the waste piles, move earth and treat the acidic water, she said.</p>
<p>The federal reclamation fund is&nbsp;“crucial to keeping us going,” said Ms. Williams, who calculated the county loses roughly $22 million in recreation spending each year due to 666 miles of polluted streams.</p>
<p>“If we don’t have it, acid mine drainage restoration would probably slowly peter out,” she said.&nbsp;“We just wouldn’t be able to do anything without it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson said his father and uncle purchased the property from the company, North American Refractories Co., in 1948&nbsp;and tried to clean it up, selling remaining clay and coal. But the scars remained.</p>
<p>“It was our plan to go back and reclaim that, but it never happened,” Mr. Johnson said, noting his father passed away before they could get the money to do it.</p>
<p>It’s very crucial that we get that through and signed,” he said.&nbsp;“There are so many abandoned mines up here in Clearfield County that it’s ridiculous.”</p>
