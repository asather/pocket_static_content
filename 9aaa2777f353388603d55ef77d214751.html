<p><strong>Hot yoga with goats</strong></p>
<p>“NamastHay is rolling out something a li’l different ... summer on the farm,” says Jen Stratakis.&nbsp;“We usually skip July and August for home field events because it can be very warm for us and the goaties,” but they will try a goat yoga session on Saturday, July 11, 10:30 a.m. to noon.</p>
<p>The $20 tickets are available at:&nbsp;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pop-up-namasthay-goat-yoga-of-pittsburghtm-to-benefit-animal-friends-tickets-110529063404?aff=ebdssbonlinesearch</p>
<p>“It might be hot yoga in a field. It might be absolutely delightful,” Ms. Stratakis said.&nbsp;“One thing is for sure. It's to benefit a great cause, one I volunteer for: Animal Friends!”</p>
<p>The goats will be doing yoga in the field where they live: Potential Farm, 101 Boyds Run Road, Presto 15142.</p>
<p>Masks are required until people get to the yoga mats, which will be placed at safe social distances in the field.&nbsp;</p>
