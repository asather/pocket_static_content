<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The preliminary hearing for Adam Rosenberg, a Fox Chapel man charged with two counts of homicide, has been postponed after his attorney said medical professionals determined he wasn’t competent to stand trial.</p>
<p>In May, Mr. Rosenberg, 21, was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/12/christian-moore-rouse-adam-rosenberg-dentel-fox-chapel-homicide-police-allegheny-county/stories/202003060148" target="_blank">charged&nbsp;with the murder of Christian Moore-Rouse</a>, 22, of Verona, while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/12/homicide-adam-rosenberg-fox-chapel-christian-moore-rouse-dentel-allegheny-county-missing/stories/202005120116" target="_blank">already in Allegheny County Jail </a>after being charged in February with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/02/20/Adam-Scott-Rosenberg-Fox-Chapel-homicide-shooting-death-Jeremy-Dentel-Baldwin/stories/202002200127" target="_blank">the killing of 28-year-old Jeremy Dentel</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Dentel was found in his home in Baldwin Borough. Mr. Moore-Rouse was reported missing on Dec. 25. In March, county detectives found human remains that were later identified as those of Mr. Moore-Rouse in a wooded area near the Rosenberg family’s property in Fox Chapel.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg is charged with homicide, robbery, abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and firearms violations.</p>
<p>Mike Manko, spokesman for the Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala, confirmed on Wednesday that Mr. Rosenberg’s case has been postponed for psychiatric evaluations.</p>
<p>Court dockets also show the date of the preliminary hearing has been changed from&nbsp;July 22&nbsp;to Oct. 9.</p>
<p>Mr. Manko confirmed that Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski signed an order to have Mr. Rosenberg transferred from Allegheny County Jail to Torrance State Hospital in Westmoreland County for further evaluations. Casey Mullen, one of the multiple attorneys representing Mr. Rosenberg, said he was recently transferred to the hospital within the past few days, but can’t confirm a specific date or time.</p>
<p>Mr. Mullen said he hopes the hospital will help provide Mr. Rosenberg&nbsp;“the care that he needs.”</p>
<p>“I understand this is a delicate process because he’s alleged of committing serious crimes and there’s other people involved,” Mr. Mullen said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mullen said he believes these evaluations are&nbsp;“essential.”</p>
<p>“It was determined by mental health professionals who evaluated on him that this is what was needed,” Mr. Mullen said.</p>
