<h1>Penguins mailbag: Should this year's Stanley Cup come with an asterisk? </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome back to Mike’s Mailbag.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>This week, the Penguins returned to the ice for the first time since the season was paused on March 12. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/06/10/Jake-Guentzel-back-on-the-ice-as-Penguins-begin-Phase-2/stories/202006100113" target="_blank">Jake Guentzel was among those who participated in the voluntary</a>, small-group workouts as a part of Phase 2. The NHL also announced on Thursday that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/06/11/nhl-training-camp-date-july-10-pittsburgh-penguins/stories/202006110113" target="_blank">Phase 3 (formal training camps) are set to open on July 10. </a></em></p>
<p><em>With the NHL chugging along toward a possible return, there’s plenty to talk about this week. Let’s get right to the questions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chris M.:</strong> Power play alignment with Guentzel back? Does it include Hornqvist on the top unit? And if not, who’s net-front on that PP1?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> The Penguins power play has been a constantly evolving organism this year. Mostly, that’s been out of necessity, considering quite literally every single member of the top unit has been injured for a significant period of time, including Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, Kris Letang, Justin Schultz, Jake Guentzel, Patric Hornqvist and Bryan Rust.</p>
<p>The truth is, I really don’t know which five-man group coach Mike Sullivan will choose because they never really settled on one group during the regular season. It’s one of the more intriguing questions entering training camp. My guess is it will look something like this: Crosby (behind the net/right circle/all over the place), Hornqvist (net front), Guentzel (left wall), Malkin (right circle), Letang (point).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main issue is the Penguins don’t have a great right-handed candidate to play on the left wall. At the start of the season, they tried a two-defenseman look with two righties,&nbsp;Letang and Schultz, on the ice together. That’s a possibility to get another righty out there. And don’t forget that Rust leads the team in goals. So he’s another candidate for the top unit, possibly in place of Guentzel or Hornqvist. So, yeah, lots of options.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Josh:</strong> I saw Geno is the Penguins’ nominee for the Masterton Trophy. Do you think any Penguins will have a shot at any others awards?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Not really. Malkin tallied the fifth-most points per game in the league, but he missed too many games for serious MVP consideration. The Penguins clearly appreciate the defensive prowess of Brandon Tanev, but he’s probably not a big enough name to actually win the Selke, even though he might get some votes. John Marino had a heck of a debut season, but most voters will probably focus more on points when they’re choosing the Calder Trophy finalists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best bet might be Sullivan for the Jack Adams award. Flyers coach Alain Vigneault turned Philadelphia into the NHL’s hottest team before the pause. And John Tortorella took a Blue Jackets team that everyone thought would be trash after their offseason departures and kept them in the mix. Those three coaches would all make good finalists.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Paul G.:</strong> Do you think Guentzel will return to Crosby’s wing or play with Malkin? He seemed to have a lot of chemistry with Geno earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> When Crosby underwent core muscle surgery in mid-November, the Penguins chose to load up their top line with the three best healthy players: Guentzel, Malkin and Rust. That trio really carried the team for about six weeks, meshing so well many were asking if it might be a line combination long-term. Of course, when Guentzel crashed violently into the boards on Dec. 30, that went out the window.</p>
<p>Despite that success, reuniting Crosby with Guentzel felt like the most likely scenario. That seems even more likely this week after the Penguins released video from a Phase 2 informal skate. Guentzel was in the small group with Crosby, while Rust was with Malkin in a separate group. I don’t think that’s an accident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s take your question a step further, though. If Guentzel-Crosby and Malkin-Rust are the top two tandems, who are the third wheels?</p>
<p>My feeling is Conor Sheary will get the nod as the right winger on the Crosby line. That trio showed chemistry during recent Cup runs. Plus I don’t think the Penguins would have gone out to get Sheary only to play him on the third line or throw him in the press box.</p>
<p>The other most-logical options would be to play Hornqvist on Crosby’s right wing or bump Jason Zucker over. We know Sullivan likes to shuffle his lines, so I could envision those scenarios playing out at some point. But in my mind, I image Zucker on Malkin’s left wing and Hornqvist settling into a third-line role during most situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bob M.:</strong> If these playoffs occur, wouldn’t they end just about the time the 2020-21 season would be scheduled to start?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Yup. I would expect to see the Stanley Cup handed out in October. And the league is okay with that.</p>
<p>Commissioner Gary Bettman said recently that there’s no “magic” to starting the season in October. They’re willing to push the 2021 season back to November, December or even January. Bettman even brought up the idea of dropping the puck on the 2021 season at the Winter Classic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, that might become the new normal. Bettman said several teams have been saying for years the NHL should make some changes to the league calendar. It wouldn’t be the worst idea to stop competing with the NFL and college football for eyeballs in the fall. They plan to see how the 2021 season unfolds and then evaluate if the change might be permanent.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lynn:</strong> Did I see Emil Larmi is coming to the U.S. to participate in Phase 2? Don’t the Penguins have enough goalies between Jarry and Murray?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Our Matt Vensel has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/06/11/emil-larmi-penguins-goaltender-prospect-finland-hockey-nhl-return/stories/202006110085" target="_blank">a story on Larmi which should explain it.</a> But my guess is the Penguins just want a couple extra goalies right now. Players can only skate in groups of six or fewer during Phase 2. So at least for these informal skates, they’ll need extra goalies.</p>
<p>Also, if the NHL doesn’t start next season until December or January, players in the minors might go nine months — or more — without seeing live game action. This could be an opportunity for a young goalie to continue to see live reps as he develops.</p>
<p>At least I assume that’s the reason. Or maybe the Penguins are just trying to pour gasoline on the Jarry vs. Murray talk radio debates.</p>
<p><strong>Rich S.:</strong> Considering how different this year was, should the winner of the Stanley Cup have an asterisk?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> No, not at all. With the months-long disruption to the training schedule, the injuries and now the new 24-team format, you could argue that the road to the Cup has never been tougher for the Penguins.</p>
<p>They clearly were in line to make the playoffs as one of the top three teams in the Metro. But now, they have to play Montreal in a five-game series just to get to the round of 16. If nothing else, they have to win three more games than ever before if they want to hoist the trophy again. I’m just using the Penguins as an example, but whichever team wins this Cup has certainly earned it.</p>
