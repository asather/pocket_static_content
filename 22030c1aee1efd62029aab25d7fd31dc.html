<h1>Pitt lands a commitment from three-star cornerback Noah Biglow</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the second time in three days, Pitt has added a player to its 2021 recruiting class.</p>
<p>Three-star cornerback Noah Biglow committed to the Panthers Thursday, becoming the 14th member of a rapidly growing recruiting class that has accumulated seven players in the past 30 days.</p>
<p>Biglow had previously committed to Iowa State, having done so in April. In addition to Pitt, the Seffner, Fla., native held scholarship offers from Duke, Virginia, Kansas and Washington State, among others.</p>
<p>At 6-0 and 175 pounds, Biglow is rated by 247 Sports as the No. 82 cornerback nationally in his class and the No. 124 prospect in talent-rich Florida. With Biglow’s pledge, the Panthers now have the No. 20 recruiting class in the country, according to Rivals.com, ranking them fourth among ACC programs, behind only Clemson, North Carolina and Miami.</p>
<p>Biglow is both the second defensive back and the second player from Florida in coach Pat Narduzzi’s 2021 class. Biglow is also the fifth defensive player in the group.</p>
<p>As part of an effort spearheaded by defensive line coach Charlie Partridge, Florida has become fertile recruiting territory for Pitt in recent years, as it has gotten a combined 10 players from the state between the 2019 and 2020 recruiting classes.</p>
