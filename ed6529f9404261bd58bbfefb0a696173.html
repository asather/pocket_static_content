<h1>Allegheny County now has 18 total COVID-19 cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County’s total number of COVID-19 cases is at 18, after six new cases were reported Thursday morning, according to the Allegheny County Health Department.</p>
<p>The cases are all “positive,” the ACHD said, using terminology that the state is now using as well.</p>
<p>The county’s announcement did not include information about which of the cases are&nbsp;“confirmed” versus&nbsp;“presumed,” as the county and the state have indicated in prior announcements.</p>

<p>“Presumed” cases have been those that have positive test results from new laboratories that have come on line that have to have their results checked with a second test by another established lab test, such as the state’s lab in Exton, Pa. Outside labs have to check their results from their first five positive and five negative tests to confirm their work is in line with expectations.</p>
<p>County spokeswoman Amie Downs said in an email response to questions that the county is now using&nbsp;“positive” because&nbsp;“we’re treating all cases from a perspective that they’re positive and not focusing on confirmed or presumed.”</p>
<p>She wrote that with so many more labs now testing samples - some of which are not yet established and technically have positive cases noted as&nbsp;“presumed” - it is changing rapidly, so the county is avoiding any distinction between presumed and confirmed.</p>
<p>The county said it is continuing to investigate the most recent cases, including contact tracing.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;state Department of Health reported Thursday that Allegheny County’s six new cases were part of 52 new positive cases statewide, with 185 total statewide spread across 22 of the state’s 67 counties. Beaver County now has two cases, Washington County three cases, and two cases in Westmoreland County. The first death from COVID-19 in the state was reported Wednesday in Northampton County.</p>
