<html><head><title>Tuned In: Ins and outs of cable blackouts of local TV channels</title></head><body><p>It’s been a rough week for Pittsburgh TV viewers who just want to turn on their TV and watch local channels.</p><p>On Wednesday, Comcast dropped WPXI-TV’s PCNC and Verizon’s FiOS TV blacked out all WPXI channels. Meanwhile,&nbsp;WTAE-TV’s parent company, Hearst, continues to negotiate with AT&amp;T’s DirecTV with the deadline for a deal pushed from midnight Tuesday to 3 p.m. Thursday and then pushed again to 3 p.m. Friday.</p><p>Why do these retransmission skirmishes break out frequently anyway?</p><p>In the 1960s “must carry” rules set by the Federal Communications Commission required cable and satellite operators to carry local broadcast channels. Then 1992’s Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act required cable and satellite operators to get permission from commercial broadcasters to carry their channels.</p><p>The 1992 act also allows broadcasters to ask cable/satellite operators for payment for carrying their channels or other compensation (like carrying a secondary channel). If the cable/satellite operator rejects that proposal, the station can pull its signal. Sometimes the cable company opts to remove the channel.</p><p>Channel blackouts have been growing in number. In July 2019, the American Television Alliance, an advocacy group representing cable and satellite distributors, said there had been 219 disruptions year-to-date compared to just eight in 2010.</p><p>ATA blames broadcasters, calling retransmission fees “a relic of a time before the internet,” and criticizes “reverse retrans,” when national broadcast networks seek a cut of retransmission profits from local stations.</p><p>“Retrans fees were intended to support local broadcast journalism, but station owners in faraway places are stripping resources from local communities to fatten their profits,” the ATA writes on its website.</p><p>In 2016, Multichannel News reported that CBS expected $2.5 billion in retransmission consent and reverse compensation revenue by 2020, according to&nbsp;Joseph Ianniello, then CBS’s chief operating officer. That was a&nbsp;$500 million increase from previous CBS forecasts.</p><p>In an email to subscribers and in on-screen messages Wednesday, Verizon claimed it dropped WPXI and other Cox Media Group channels in several markets because CMG “demanded we pay increases of over 70% so you can continue watching their channel. This is like the price of gas going from $2.99 a gallon to over $5 overnight. The provider has refused to accept our reasonable offers and won’t let us carry these channels.”</p><p>Cox Media Group countered saying Verizon decided to remove the channels. CMG also said that Verizon’s offer was below current market rates and on terms that no other video provider has demanded from a broadcaster.</p><p>“At multiple points in the negotiation, CMG offered Verizon extensions to avoid disruption to their customers,” CMG said in its release. “Unfortunately, Verizon has refused all extension offers and instead made the decision to remove these stations as they continued the negotiation.</p><p>“Cox Media Group has made every effort to get Verizon to restore these stations to their lineup and will continue to negotiate in good faith to reach a resolution as quickly as possible.”</p><p>Viewers, of course, are caught in the middle. If you’re mad at Comcast for dropping PCNC, you could consider a change to Verizon, but given that Verizon just dropped WPXI, it’s clear that no matter where viewers turn on the cable/satellite horizon, viewing plans may be disrupted by a blackout.</p><p>And while going back to an antenna to receive local stations over the air is a great idea in theory, Western Pennsylvania’s hilly topography often makes it difficult to get all local broadcast channels via antenna.</p><p>Advances in technology that allow viewers to cut the cord and opt for TV via Hulu or another service have made the TV business more challenging still.</p><p>Cord cutting has resulted in lower ratings for programming and ratings are how TV has traditionally set ad rates. Advertising income is used to pay for the cost to produce TV programming, which gets more expensive every year.</p><p>If advertising dollars wane, media companies look elsewhere for profit, including those retransmission fees at the heart of TV channel blackouts.</p><p><em>TV writer Rob Owen: rowen@post-gazette.com or 412-263-2582.
