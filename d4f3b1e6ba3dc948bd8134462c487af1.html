<h1>Healthcare, economic relief at center of Lamb-Parnell debate</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tense disagreements over the Affordable Care Act and its protections of people who have preexisting conditions — as well as issues of fracking and the nation’s arduous economic recovery from COVID-19 — defined the much-anticipated debate between U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb and his Republican challenger Sean Parnell on Saturday.</p>
<p>In a debate that was as much about style and character as it was incompatible ideological differences, Mr. Lamb and Mr. Parnell used their time behind the podiums at WPXI’s studios to say that they’re really the one who can work across the aisle and wade through political divisiveness in Washington to get things done for Pennsylvania’s 17th Congressional District.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb, the freshman Democrat, said he’s already proven he can do that, citing bills he’s co-introduced with Republicans that were signed by the Republican president.</p>
<p>Mr. Parnell, a first-time candidate and Army veteran who has won repeated public praise from President Donald Trump, said he was a unifying person as an infantry leader in the war in Afghanistan and can do it again in D.C., accusing Mr. Lamb of reversing course on his moderate promises to instead align his House votes with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and&nbsp;“the most radical members of his party.”</p>
<p>Though Mr. Parnell said his opponent’s voting record speaks for itself, Mr. Lamb countered that talking about other politicians who aren’t from the district is a distraction from the real issues.</p>
<p>Lucky for voters, some of those issues — ones that have been omnipresent on the candidates’ social media feeds and television airwaves early in this race and have often times mirrored issues in the race for president —&nbsp;were discussed at length in the 30-minute televised debate.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb centered his warning to the residents of the 17th — which covers all of Beaver County and parts of Butler and Allegheny counties — on health care and the Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act, which he said has been successful in preventing insurance companies from discriminating against people who have preexisting medical conditions.</p>
<p>“Today, you are protected by that law, but tomorrow you may not be,” Mr. Lamb warned. “I’ll continue to work to keep that law in place.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb, who has been airing an advertisement recently that alleges Mr. Parnell wants to take away protections for those with preexisting conditions, said it’s a simple reason why he’s arguing that: because his opponent is in favor of overturning the law that&nbsp;“protects you now.”</p>
<p>Insisting multiple times that he supports protecting people who have those conditions, Mr. Parnell said it’s personal to him — that he was&nbsp;“blown up in Afghanistan,” fractured his skull and had a traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p>“I have family members that I love lose their health care, that have seen their premiums quadruple and now have to pay out of pocket for health care,” Mr. Parnell said, adding that he’s&nbsp;“upset” about how the law was passed by Democrats.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb countered, “I just think you don’t get it. This isn’t about you being upset.” The law protects people now, and those people would rather be protected by the law than by rhetoric or presidential executive orders on the eve of the election, Mr. Lamb said.</p>
<p>“The last thing that we should do is throw out the law that guarantees coverage to 133 million Americans,” Mr. Lamb said.</p>
<p>Mr. Parnell, who had said during the debate that he supports a bill that was introduced by Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told reporters after the debate that he favors it because it preserves&nbsp;“the more popular aspects of the Affordable Care Act” —&nbsp;including letting people stay on their parents’ plan until age 26 and the preexisting condition protections.</p>
<p>The Republican also said he likes the idea, among others, of letting insurance companies compete across state lines — that&nbsp;“more competition drives the cost down for the consumer” and will lead to better health care.</p>
<p>Asked if government officials should be pursuing an end to the Affordable Care Act during a pandemic,&nbsp;Mr. Parnell said he doesn’t know the answer, but that he spoke with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., last week — along with other candidates and GOP members of the House —&nbsp;about how Republicans need to make sure “that we don’t make the same mistakes in the past” and that protecting people with preexisting conditions is important.</p>
<p>“I can’t speak to whether or not the Supreme Court will take up the [Affordable Care Act], but I certainly want to see people that suffer from preexisting conditions protected for sure,” Mr. Parnell said.</p>
<p>Mr. Parnell criticized Mr. Lamb for being part of a party — he says — that’s holding up COVID-19 economic relief because it doesn’t fulfill the Democrats’ “far left radical wish-list” untethered to what’s needed to fix the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What we actually need to do is advocate for coronavirus [relief] that is directly tethered to the actual virus itself and get back on the path of reopening this economy, letting people go back to work and go back to work safely so that people can start putting food on the table for their families again,” Mr. Parnell said, noting that a group of House Democrats recently wrote to the Democratic House Speaker to ask&nbsp;for “clean” relief legislation.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb countered that the major holdup is that Republicans won’t support legislation that addresses the unemployment program, stimulus checks and funding for local governments — and that “the fact is, you&nbsp;can’t pick out one group — small businesses — and say, ‘Oh, we have to do only for them and leave everybody else in our society behind.’”</p>
<p>Before the debate ended, the candidates were asked about their positions on fracking, and Mr. Lamb said fracking continues to provide jobs and affordable energy to Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Mr. Parnell quipped that he didn’t know how Mr. Lamb could say that with a straight face, given that the presidential candidate he supports — former Vice President Joe Biden — has publicly said he’d get rid of fossil fuels, and that vice presidential candidate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, said she supports banning fracking.</p>
<p>Asked afterwards if Mr. Biden’s public messaging has been a detriment to his congressional campaign, Mr. Lamb said the only people who are misconstruing his stance on fracking are Mr. Parnell and the president. He noted that Mr. Biden has reiterated several times he does not intend to ban fracking, but wants to cease oil and gas drilling permits on federal land.</p>
<p>The election is Nov. 3. There is currently no second debate scheduled.</p>
