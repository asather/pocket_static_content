<h1>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Don Walko to step down in September</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Don Walko announced Tuesday that he will step down on Sept. 4, after more than 10 years on the bench.</p>
<p>Voters chose to retain Judge Walko, who currently works in the civil division, for another 10-year term during last year’s election. Pennsylvania’s constitution will allow the governor to appoint a judge, with two-thirds of the Senate’s approval, to fill the seat until the municipal election in 2021.</p>
<p>He said he ran to retain his seat out of indecision.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving not because I don’t enjoy being a judge. It’s just that I want to pursue other things while I can,” the 67-year-old said in an interview Tuesday.</p>
<p>Before he became a judge in 2010, he spent 15 years in Pennsylvania’s Legislature as a representative for the 20th District. He&nbsp;“saw a challenge to be met” in being a judge, and worked in the family division for eight years before he was transferred to the civil division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of his future endeavors will be volunteering with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2020/07/21/VoteSafe-Pennsylvania-begins-effort-to-educate-voters-on-how-safely-cast-votes-in-November/stories/202007210106" target="_blank">VoteSafe Pennsylvania</a>, a coalition of government officials — including all of the state’s living former governors — focused on&nbsp;educating voters on how to participate in November’s election.</p>
<p>“It’s&nbsp;hard to get it out of your blood,” Judge Walko said of politics. He pointed out that he has&nbsp;four adult children and is worried about the environment, civil rights and voting rights, among other things.</p>
<p>“I’m just concerned,” he said. “I want to be involved after I’m a judge in promoting things that I believe are in the best interest of our nation. It sounds corny, but it’s true.”</p>
<p>He cited <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/10/05/1-partisan-divides-over-political-values-widen/" target="_blank">growing partisan divides</a> among Democrats and Republicans, a stark contrast to his early days as a legislator, when House members would&nbsp;debate with colleagues on the other side of the aisle and then “have a beer with them” later that night.</p>
<p>“We disagreed with each other on the House floor, but we did not dislike one another,” he said.</p>
<p>He felt frustrated and restrained at being unable to be involved in politics as a judge, even though he agreed they shouldn’t be political.</p>
<p>“I don’t think judges should be involved in politics,” he added. “You have to base your ruling on the laws and the facts, and if you don’t like the law — unless you’re on the Supreme Court — you have to go with it.”</p>
<p>He said he will miss talking to his colleagues about court cases and the camaraderie among people at the courthouse.</p>
<p>Much of what he wants to do involves spending more time with his kids and he will&nbsp;“see wherever the road takes me as far as politics and other things.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The other thing now, going back into a nonjudicial post, my jokes won’t be as funny,” he said. “People won’t stand when I walk into the room. It’s a different world.”</p>
