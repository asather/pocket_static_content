<h1>Future under 'green phase' is as clear as mud </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Most counties are now in the “green phase” — the third and final of three phases governing Pennsylvania’s reopening. But not everything is green-lit in the green phase, and a return to yellow is not out of the question.</p>
<p>State leaders need to give Pennsylvania counties a better idea of what further developments could happen after entering the green phase and what events might trigger a return to more restrictive measures.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf’s decision to move Allegheny and other counties into the green phase is based on a reduction in new cases of COVID-19 and related deaths, as well as recommendations from medical experts. For the sake of people’s health, there are still significant limits in the final phase. Places such as restaurants and bars can open, but only at 50% occupancy. Personal services such as hair salons and barber shops can operate by appointment only. Group gatherings are allowed but restricted to 250 people.</p>
<p>These limitations on the size of crowds are prudent, but the green phase still comes with uncertainties. Large venues that host concerts or festivals have expressed concern that restrictions will not end until a vaccine is found. Officials in rural Elk County, which is now in the green phase, are among those requesting more detailed metrics and guidance so communities aren’t shocked if they have to shift phases again.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf has admitted he is unsure of what might come next for counties after entering this final phase of reopening. He needs to clarify in his own mind and then state policy.</p>
<p>If the state government wants to maintain calm and reassure citizens while going into the green phase, it needs to outline what circumstances will initiate change. For instance, counties in California had to quickly roll back reopening orders after a spike in coronavirus cases immediately followed. Maryland reported the largest rise in coronavirus cases four days after reopening in mid-May.</p>
<p>No one knows how long the limitations of the green phase might last. But everyone needs to know what might entail a county reverting back to the yellow phase, when and how restrictions might be lessened, and what would allow for a full reopening. What’s the plan if cases begin to rise again? Will a full reopening occur only after a vaccine is available?</p>
<p>What is going to happen next is impossible to determine. But residents should know what next steps their leaders are considering as they deal with an ever-changing situation.</p>
