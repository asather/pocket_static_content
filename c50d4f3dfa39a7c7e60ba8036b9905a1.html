<h1>Duke's Mike Krzyzewski sticks up for Pitt's Jeff Capel with tirade at student section</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Duke students drew the ire of their coach in an uncharacteristic outburst during the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/01/28/pitt-duke-jeff-capel-coach-k-kobe-bryant-tribute/stories/202001280172" target="_blank">Blue Devils’ win against Pitt</a> on Tuesday night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Late in the first half, students began chanting&nbsp;“sit with us” at Panthers coach Jeff Capel, a Duke alum and former assistant coach. That prompted his former boss, Mike Krzyzewski, to holler an admonishment from across the court.&nbsp;“Shut up” he appeared to yell loudly several times, before a referee intervened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His fury continued at the end of the half, when he strode over to the students and reportedly yelled&nbsp;“he’s one of us,” referring to Capel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the game,&nbsp;Krzyzewski apologized and explained that he interpreted the chant as personal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m not going to go say,&nbsp;‘Will you please tell me exactly what you’re doing,’ ”&nbsp;Krzyzewski said.&nbsp;“So it’s a mistake on my part. But I’d rather make the mistake in protection of my guy. And then I went just at the end of the half and said&nbsp;‘Look, he’s our guy. He’s our guy.’ That’s it. So I apologize.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game was Capel’s first at Duke as Pitt coach. He is seen by some as a potential successor to the legendary Krzyzewski, who is 72.</p>
<p>Capel, for his part, said that he wasn’t sure what the Duke coach was yelling about.</p>
<p>“I think he was trying to tell me what happened,” he said. “I honestly didn’t know. He was maybe trying to apologize for what happened.”</p>
