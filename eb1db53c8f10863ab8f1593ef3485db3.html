<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat: 07.29.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hello everyone. Welcome to my weekly Pirates chat. We’ll get started a little early today, around 11:45 a.m., but feel free to leave your questions now. Thanks so much! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: And away we go ...</p>
<p><strong>Jason in Slippery Rock</strong>: Colin Moran is big and strong; do you think his power is for real? How many HRs could he hit in a regular-length season? I’m encouraged... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Jason. I am encouraged, yes. Honestly, I’ve been encouraged by Moran since spring training; my only hesitation was whether this would translate to the regular season. Clearly, it has. Now, it needs to continue. As far as 162 ... I think he has the power for at least 20-plus, maybe 30 or more if he really gets going. But again, talking potentially. Actually doing it is a different animal.</p>
<p><strong>Scott S</strong>: Jason-with some luck, the Pirates could be 4-1 after 5 games. When Kela returns, what role do you see him playing set up man or closer? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Probably a little more than luck, Scott. I think they are deficient in some areas, but I get your point: Despite hitting .194 as a team, which is last in the National League, they’re 2-3. Their bullpen has stunk, too, while they’re missing three of their top six arms in Kela, Crick and Santana. If they start hitting, Kela comes back, the bullpen improves, as I’ve been saying, this isn’t a terrible baseball team. And, FWIW, I would give Burdi at least one more shot in the ninth. If he pitches well, he’s gonna be my closer ... for now. That would allow me to slow-play Kela’s return, which I think might be necessary given how little he has been able to do.</p>
<p><strong>William</strong>: How do you see the events that have transpired this year impacting the fast approaching trade deadline and ensuing free agent market? Not just for the Pirates, but league wide as well. Also, I believe we were all Los Angeles Dodgers fans last night. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi William. I think Holland pitching well does not hurt at all. Now, it’s one start, and we’ll need to see more, but say this does continue. He’s absolutely someone they can flip at the deadline. That said, they won’t get anything for Dyson and probably not Kela, assuming Kela hasn’t returned. It also isn’t helping that he’s not pitching. As for the ensuing free agent market, not sure. I worried about the overall financial landscape, then I saw the Mookie Betts contract. I don’t think it will be as bad as many think.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Here are a couple fairly unimportant questions. One is that I’ve heard the broadcasters mention that they hope there can be fans in the stadiums later on in the season. Is that a real possibility or are they just being wishful? And why does John Ryan Murphy get referred to using both first and middle name? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Rich. 1. Yes, this is something the Pirates still hope can happen. They planned to present something to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, too, a configuration that would be socially distanced and theoretically safe. Do I think it will go through? Absolutely not. Especially not now given how things have turned overall with COVID-19 and also not in the wake of the Marlins stuff. Would be an awful, irresponsible look for baseball, even more so than usual. 2. I honestly have no idea. I will try to find out, however. Perhaps it’s just something that has always been that way?</p>
<p><strong>Dick</strong>: I know it’s early, but it looks like this team is evolving toward the past injured and younger players.Do you think Polanco will make a comeback? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Dick. Good question. Polanco has not looked good since returning from COVID-19. However, I’m not giving up on him yet. I still think there’s something there. You’re right. They are skewing younger and giving other guys chances. But it’s not like they have someone beating down the door in right field. Maybe Cole Tucker could be that guy, but I think that’s an even bigger question mark than Polanco at this point. Jason Martin and Jared Oliva? Again, maybe. But I think I would still bet Polanco in that scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Justin</strong>: Had this discussion the other day, if you could hypothetically add one good quality player (doesn’t have to be All-Star) to the roster, which position would you choose. I was thinking starting pitcher but may change my answer to corner outfield. Thanks <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It’s starting pitcher for me. And not close. Always pitching.</p>
<p><strong>Tuck</strong>: obviously there are a lot of question marks right now and few things are clicking but is there any reason for optimism that the bullpen will stabilize? i just don’t know enough about some of these new names to know whether to expect more out of them. thanks! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey Tuck. Actually yes. I think this bullpen is better than its current 5.09 ERA. Obviously Santana isn’t coming back, but there’s more there with Crick. Kela is in an unfortunate spot. When he gets back, that will help a lot, slotting guys into the appropriate roles. I’ve liked Brubaker. I think Nik Turley has been good, too. JT Brubaker has the making of someone really, really solid, potentially deserving of more. My point is that the talent is there. But they do need to execute better and develop some roles. Right now it’s all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong>: So, this bullpen.... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Bit of a head-scratcher, eh?</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong>: Do u think Moran is considered part of the future plans? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I do, Doug. And here’s why: They very well could wind up needing a corner infielder. Or a DH. Or both. Now, if he stops hitting, and this turns out to be a mirage, obviously that changes the calculus. But you’re gonna say they have a left-handed bat who hits for power who may be a below-average third baseman? I don’t care. On this team, you hit, you play. So maybe they DH Josh Bell. Maybe they DH Moran. Maybe Jose Osuna plays the outfield. Maybe Ke’Bryan Hayes is not yet ready. I don’t know. But I do know if a guy is hitting, I’m finding a way to make him a part of my team, and I’m pretty sure they feel the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Jim M.</strong>: Jason, The Pirates obviously need bullpen help. Do you know if there are any recent DFAs that are worth a look? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t think it matters, Jim. Honestly, we’ve done this add ______ _______ dance before. They haven’t done it. I don’t see what is going to compel them to do it now. Their plan -- even if they won’t say it -- is to minimize expenditures in the present and try to build for the future. A DFA’d reliever doesn’t fit that.</p>

<p><strong>Guest</strong>: How do you see the bullpen working out? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It’s an interesting question at this point. Right now, Burdi is clearly the closer, even if Shelton doesn’t want to say it. I’d try Brubaker and Turley in higher-leverage roles, just to see what happens. I think you need to give Rodriguez and Feliz more chances, and they’re probably the leaders for back-end innings. Chris Stratton stays as a long man for me. I’m curious to see what Hartlieb can do, and eventually I think they need to get Blake Cederlind up here, whenever he’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>Colin</strong>: Hey Jason, the bullpen has had a lot of issues in the first few games, what pitchers can Shelton put in to hold down leads, or not give up runs? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: This seems to be a popular question ... he’s using ‘em. There’s no magical door that he can check behind, trust me. I suppose you could break apart the Brault/Kuhl piggyback, but I don’t know if you know enough to see what makes sense. (I.e. Brault or Kuhl to the bullpen?) I think you try and gain a larger sample size with the guys you do have.</p>
<p><strong>Jim M.</strong>: Jason, Addendum to my previous question: How about someone like Mike Foltynewicz? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Addendum to my previous answer: I don’t see how paying him $6 whatever million fits into their current business plan.</p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: You had said previously to wait and see if the bullpen did better once the season started. By my rough count the starters give up 1.25 h/w per inning with a 3.16 era and the relievers 1.47 h/w per inning with a 8.24 era (I know my numbers are off a bit but should be close). How long til we should worry about the pen? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: More than five games, I’ll say that. At least in terms of officially worrying. A lot of people are asking, “What are they gonna do?” What can they do? The guys they have are the guys they have. I’m not lobbying for more Miguel Del Pozo. Maybe Geoff Hartlieb and definitely Blake Cederlind, but it’s not like that’s going to fix the whole thing. Some of the guys they have need to pitch better and be a little more consistent That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong>: Stallings is a good MLB starting catcher. Change my mind. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I would not argue with that. His receiving and throwing have been league-best level thus far. I’d only maybe add a “very” in there, at least from a defensive standpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Owen</strong>: Humor us and take a stab at the 2021 opening day lineup including DH. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I’m here to entertain ... Newman 2B/SS, Reynolds LF, Bell 1B, Moran DH, Polanco RF, Hayes 3B, Stallings C, Tucker 2B/SS, Martin CF <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Couple things: I may try Martin at leadoff. ... Newman and Tucker, whoever feels more comfortable moves. ... I don’t love Bell in the No. 3 spot, but I do like Bell, Moran and Polanco as my 3-4-5 in some capacity. Could even involve Reynolds and trust that 2-5 would figure itself out.</p>
<p><strong>Owen</strong>: Is Blake Cinderland an option at any point this season? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: *Cederlind. And yes, absolutely. I think you’ll see him. Just a matter of when he’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>Tuck</strong>: What should we make phillip evans? i’ve been impressed but my expectations really couldn’t have been lower. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Admit it: You didn’t even know who Phillip Evans was to start the season. Hey, for what he is -- a utility bench guy -- the Pirates could do much, much. I’d take Evans in a heartbeat over Erik Gonzalez or JT Riddle, although I could understand keeping one of those two around because they’re probably better late-inning defensive infielders.</p>
<p><strong>William</strong>: Is it just me, or is it actually a sad state of affairs for this team that the player we are getting the most excited about is...Colin Moran? Also, when will we stop looking at Cole Tucker through black and gold colored glasses? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Colin Moran was acquired in a trade for Gerrit Cole, a trade for a former No. 1 pick that was widely criticized. Through 10% of the season, he’s tied for the home run lead. I’m not saying it’s going to continue or that he’s the greatest power hitter that ever lived, but I don’t think it’s pathetic or weird for fans to enjoy that. ... As for Tucker, I tweeted this last night. I think we’re focusing on the wrong stuff. I think he’s gonna be fine defensively. I worry about his ability to hit major league pitching. He strikes out too much. His pitch selection is also not very good, either chasing or watching. It’s there. He has the talent and the drive. But before anointing him an every-day starter, there has to be more offense.</p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: I saw a video clip where Iowa held their high school baseball/softball championship tournaments with limited socially distanced fans and only 7% of the 673 teams were affected by covid and 96% of the teams finished the tournament. Do you see mlb allowing a limited number of socially distanced fans in at some point? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t. I understand the logic behind it, believe me. I think they could have fans, people could not be morons, and it would also work out fine. I wish for fans’ sake that it would, too. The games aren’t the same. But give the Marlins mess and cases spiking around here -- enough to stop the Blue Jays from coming -- I don’t see MLB and/or the Pa. Department of Health agreeing to that. From a league perspective, it would be a terrible look right now.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Lots of bullpen questions, but not one that I would feel may be most important this early on...Shelton’s use has kind of been...interesting. Seems to be staying with pitchers too long. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think he’s trying to let guys prove themselves, Josh. Also, the guy has managed five games. I think we should maybe let him get a feel, too. I don’t disagree that he’s had a crazy long leash on a few occasions (see: Del Pozo, Miguel; also: Feliz) but it’s a tough spot. Early on. Not everybody is completely ready. Pirates trying to figure out what they have. I’d just try to have some patience with it.</p>
<p><strong>Owen</strong>: If things fall completely apart and pirates are awarded first pick, what do you know about Kamar Rocker? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I know that he’s really, really good. I know that a future rotation of him, Brennan Malone and Quinn Priester would be incredible. I also have a tough time seeing the Pirates wind up with the first overall pick, but if they do, man would that be fun. Also, it’s Kumar, not Kamar.</p>
<p><strong>Owen</strong>: No disrespect to Phil Evans and Jose Osuna, but if Will Craig cant challenge those guys for a spot, does he even have one? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t think he does, no. It does not seem like this new regime has much faith in Will Craig, right or wrong. He hasn’t gotten much of a chance. And to be fair to the new regime, too, Craig hasn’t exactly forced anyone’s hand dating back to spring training. Defense has been fine, but he’s been quiet at the plate.</p>
<p><strong>Mark C.</strong>: If you were the Pirates GM, would you take a flyer on Mike Foltynewicz? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I would want to, yes. I believe there’s something there. But if I was the Pirates GM, I don’t think I would have the green light to do whatever I wanted. Compared to what appears to be their current MO, I just don’t see a move like this fitting.</p>
<p><strong>Tuck</strong>: Keller’s velo was down but he was locating his fastball much higher in the zone compared to last year. is that a coaching philosophy? or should we be worried about him locating pitches in addition to the velo drop? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It’s coaching. Oscar Marin has emphasized this a lot, especially for a guy like Keller. Also, it was brutal weather-wise Sunday in St. Louis. I was there. I think that played a part, too. But, yes, Keller has been intentionally trying to utilize the upper part of the zone with his four-seamer (which has a great spin rate). My guess is he’s probably trying to ensure he hits his spot. Misses up there can be bad.</p>
<p><strong>Kenneth Kissel</strong>: What options do the Pirates have to acquire a new Pitcher due to the thin options currently there? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Honestly, Kenneth, not a ton. And I don’t think it matters right now. As in, with their issues, I don’t think they’re going to be solved by the even the best free agent signing. This is, after all, the Pirates. As a fan, I think you should probably expect them to ride it out with what they do have.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: In a full 162 game season, I see a guy like Dyson making a difference because of his glove/speed. With the season they are on, he’s not going to be part of the future so how long would they stick with him? I’d really like to see a guy like Jared Oliva get a look in CF to see if he can be part of the solution next year. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I sort of agree with you, Bill. I think they should be looking some toward the future. But I also think it’s important to have a guy like Dyson around, someone who has experience and has been on World Series clubs. Sort of a show-you-how-to-do-it kinda thing. It’s a balance with playing guys like that and involving them and also getting young guys exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: Can we expect a fast track to the bigs for Nick Gonzalez since he’s already been assigned to the Altoona taxi squad? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Gabe, I think Gonzales is going to dictate that, honestly. I think he’s capable. And I think this year is probably far-fetched. But I think he’s going to have to perform, and then they’ll move him up accordingly. It wouldn’t be very smart -- or fair -- for them to script the timeline out ahead of time.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/.media/2/2019/07/31/e8cb627f-df86-4bcb-a445-72a34e955033.jpg" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Jason, kind of odd that they passed over a couple RP on the 40 man (Howard/Ponce/Cederlind) to callup Del Pozo. That guy looked terrible. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I’m sure he wasn’t trying to pitch like that, Bill. Not defending it. He stunk. But I can’t imagine he was pitching like that at Altoona, the other guys were tearing it up, and they missed that decision. The guy couldn’t throw a strike last night. That stinks. It happens. But someone else should get a shot. I don’t know about Cederlind’s readiness, though I can check today. I hear ya on Howard and Ponce, although we’re really splitting hairs here. If they’re worried about this decision, they’re already in a heap of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Tuck</strong>: Folty’s velo and spin rate are all down and it seems his pitches have less movement. Braves previously said it was mechanics but they clearly haven’t figured it out. I’m not seeing the upside but I guess the staff isn’t exactly deep right now... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It’s a tough one. I think it would require scouting him (hence why you employ the guys). And if one of them told me, as the GM, no way, then I’d punt. But I would absolutely kick tires. I think the Pirates’ concerns here are different.</p>
<p><strong>A Frazier</strong>: So what do the Pirates have in me, in your humble opinion? When I first came up, there was some crazy talk about a batting title. And was that Gold Glove truly legit? Do other teams know my name? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Gracias. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Mr. Frazier. Nice homer last night. I think the Gold Glove is legit, although you might be swimming in a weak NL talent pool. But you are absolutely a valuable commodity, and I would be surprised if you finish the season with the Pirates. I could see another team valuing your contributions for a potential playoff run.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: When will we see Polanco in the outfield this year? Or will he be mostly DH when he’s in the lineup? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think he’ll bounce back and forth. They were trying to slow play his return, making sure he was OK. I think you’ll probably see him out there tonight, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Injuries are really killing this pen. But what about guys like Marvel and Ponce? Maybe a fast track for Bolton and have him learn through the pen like cardinals did for years. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think after five games, we need not be so reactionary. What about some of the guys they do have performing better? This isn’t the NFL. They haven’t pitched well, I agree, but you can’t react to things off of one or two outings. Like them or hate them, some of these guys have much larger sample sizes than Marvel or Ponce. I’m fine with giving those guys a look at some point, but they’re gonna have to start as long guys and earn more. I also might want to keep them built up as starters in case something happen.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: Follow up too: How’s Polanco’s arm reportedly after the injury? Back to about where it was or is he still building up strength? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: That’s absolutely fine. He had COVID-19, too. He didn’t re-injure his shoulder. No issues with the throwing.</p>
<p><strong>Mark C.</strong>: I just want to make sure I understand you correctly, when you say “ I think the Pirates’ concerns here are different”, do you mean they are actively trying to keep the payroll as low as possible, no matter what? If it means taking a chance for (relatively low risk acquisition wise), to acquire a player who could help you not just now, but for the future, that would be pretty short sighted IMO. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I mean that they have spent very little to try and win this year. Not saying they’re tanking, but they’re not willingly taking on any substantive new payroll. Folty would require that. I’m saying signing him would not fit with the way they have operated thus far. Also, taking such a chance would be kinda nuts after this organization just laid off 45 people, right?</p>
<p><strong>Shelton D</strong>: So I noticed that the yinzers were bent out of shape because I am using NB cautiously. Did they see what happened to him last year? Geez, no honeymoon in the Burgh, it seems... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Haha. I understand people being mad. That’s the fun of it. People care. We all should want them to care. And part of me thinks that the day after throwing 11 pitches, Burdi can throw again. At the same time, I’d rather have him long-term because I think he’s a really good pitcher and a valuable asset. So, if that’s what it takes, I get it.</p>
<p><strong>Tuck</strong>: What’s your reaction to zeise’s piece about Huntington vs. Littlefield? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: After a game last night, I’ve been trying to spend a few minutes with my family -- have this chat, a work call, Zoom interviews, then off to the ballpark -- this morning. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>wvpirate</strong>: Does 2 more players get cut at the end of next week? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yes. Down to 28 after two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: After all the legit work I put in, I still can’t pull the darn trigger on that pesky throw to second. Did that play seal my fate as a DHer? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t think so, but your hesitancy throwing did show up there. Dude, just let ‘er rip. I’ve seen it. I know it’s in there. And if you airmail it, not to be a wise guy, but it wouldn’t be the first time. Just fire the darn thing. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. Looks like that’s gonna do it for this week. Have something else to run and do. Thanks so much for participating. Talk to ya next week!</p>
