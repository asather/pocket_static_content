<p><strong>MONDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chieftains:</strong> A festive week of Irish music begins with a visit from the group that helped spread it all over the world. The six-time Grammy-winning Ambassadors for Irish Music, established in 1962, are on The Irish Goodbye Tour, which they admit might be just a little bit of marketing. Asked about the name of the tour, leader Paddy Moloney recently told Irish Philadelphia, “I haven’t a clue. But somebody came up with that idea, I don’t know why. When we went to Canada, maybe that’s why we got a standing ovation before we came out. They probably thought this is it. But look it, think about the Rolling Stones, they’re six months younger than we are and how many times do they come back? So, let’s see how she goes.” The group, which also features two members who go back to the ’70s (Kevin Conneff and Matt Molloy) and a fleet of touring members, bring the classics to Heinz Hall, Downtown. 7:30 p.m. <a href="/pittsburghsymphony.org" target="_blank">pittsburghsymphony.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Howard Jones Acoustic Trio:</strong> The 65-year-old British singer-songwriter turned up in the New Wave era in 1983, working on the lighter side of synth-pop with hits like “What is Love?” and “No One Is To Blame.” One of the high points of his career was performing at Live Aid in 1985. He’s currently on the Howard Jones Acoustic Trio tour, playing electric piano, joined by acoustic guitarist Robin Boult (Roger Daltrey, Dave Stewart) and chapman stick player Nick Beggs (Kajagoogoo, Belinda Carlisle). Jones will mix songs with stories about his career and the inspiration behind his music. Jergel’s, Marshall. 8 p.m. $27 advance; $30 day of show; <a href="/jergels.com" target="_blank">jergels.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Twin Peaks:</strong> These tasteful garage-rockers from Chicago have built a following the last few years with rowdy live shows and a style that hints at the Stones and Velvet Underground. The band’s fourth record, “Lookout Low,” recorded with legendary producer Ethan Johns (Paul McCartney, Ryan Adams, Kings of Leon) finds them working in a looser ‘70s jam-rock vein. The play Mr. Smalls, Millvale, with Rookie and James Swanberg. 8 p.m. $20; <a href="/ticketweb.com" target="_blank">ticketweb.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY-SATURDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sunstar 11:</strong> Sunstar Festival: Women &amp; Music returns to the Kelly Strayhorn Theater in East Liberty for the 11th year with a lively mix of music and conversation. It begins at 8 p.m. Friday with Classically Intimate, an evening of classical music curated by Pittsburgh’s own Anqwenique. On Saturday at 1 p.m., about when the St. Patrick’s Day Parade is wrapping up, Girls Running Sh**’s Markeea “Keea” Hart, Janita Kilgore, and Mia Marshall host Sisters Are Doin’ It, a brunch and conversation about the realities of being a black woman in the Pittsburgh music scene. Later on Saturday, at 8 p.m., some of those ladies get to shine with Mic Check, a showcase of rap, R&amp;B and soul with Clara Kent, INEZ, Rhyme, and Brittney Chantele. Admission is $10 to $25 each or Pay What Makes You Happy. Info at <a href="/kelly-strayhorn.org" target="_blank">kelly-strayhorn.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Celine Dion:</strong> Pittsburgh gets a taste of Vegas with a rare appearance by superstar Celine Dion, who has sold more than 250 million albums worldwide while earning five Grammys and two Oscars. The Canadian diva brings hits like “My Heart Will Go On,” “That’s the Way it Is” and “It's All Coming Back to Me Now,” along with songs from her chart-topping new album “Courage,” her first English album in six years. 7:30 p.m. A few scattered tickets are left at <a href="/ticketmaster.com" target="_blank">ticketmaster.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Cray:</strong> The veteran bluesman, inspired by the likes of Muddy Waters and Albert King, opted for “funky, cool and bad” on his brand new album, “That’s What I Heard.” The five-time Grammy winner and longtime producer Steve Jordan set out to capture the sound of an old Sam Cooke record, blending R&amp;B, soul and gospel. He adds four new songs to a collection of classics by Curtis Mayfield, Bobby “Blue” Bland, The Sensational Nightingales and more. He brings the tour to the Palace Theatre, Greensburg, with Clinton Clegg (of The Commonheart). 7 p.m. $39-$59; <a href="/thepalacetheatre.org" target="_blank">thepalacetheatre.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Joe/Donnell Jones:</strong> Upscale &amp; Classy With Popa Banks Presents The SOUL SUITE with Joe, the R&amp;B singer from Georgia who broke out in the ‘90s and charted such hits as “All the Things (Your Man Won’t Do),” “I Wanna Know” and “Stutter.” The singer, who’s aspired to be like Marvin Gaye, is joined by Chicago singer Donell Jones, bringing “U Know What's Up,” “Where I Wanna Be,” his cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Knocks Me Off My Feet” and more to Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, Oakland. 7:45 p.m. $45; <a href="/eventbrite.com" target="_blank">eventbrite.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Districts:</strong> Originally from Lititz, Pennsylvania, and now based in Philadelphia, the jangly indie-rock band on Fat Possum Records is on tour with a fourth album, “You Know I’m Not Going Anywhere,” mixed by Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips, Spoon, MGMT, Tame Impala). Frontman Rob Grote said upon its release, “I really just needed to be myself instead of being what someone else thought I should be, whether that was like some masculine bar-band singer or… I don’t know. I just want to be myself, and I want to try and do that as best as I can. This record is paradoxically the most-Districts record ever with no intention of ever being one at all.” They play Mr. Smalls, Millvale, with And the Kids. 8 p.m. $18; <a href="/ticketweb.com" target="_blank">ticketweb.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>O.A.R.:</strong> The alt-rock band from Rockville, Maryland, that broke out in the mid-2000s plays the Roxian in McKees Rocks at 8 p.m.; <a href="/roxianlive.com" target="_blank">roxianlive.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Code Orange:</strong> Back in January 2017, the Pittsburgh band set up on the South Side to launch “Forever,” an album that would earn a Grammy nomination and propel them to a new level of stardom in the metal community. This time, Code Orange, which did not play a single show in Pittsburgh last year, hits the Roxian in McKees Rocks for the release of the latest sonic barrage, “Underneath.” This show will be the first time Pittsburgh sees drummer Jami Morgan step out as a frontman. Prepare to get physical. With Every Time I Die, Zao, Jesus Piece, Machine Girl, Facewreck. 6 p.m. $28/$30; <a href="/roxianlive.com" target="_blank">roxianlive.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Bastard Bearded Irishmen:</strong> We’re happy to report that Pittsburgh’s premier Irish punk band was not playing a cruise this year leading up to St. Patrick’s Day, as they’ve done in the past. The group led by the rowdy Jimmy Bastard is on land and ready for its annual blowout at the Rex Theater, South Side, where it will be joined by two Ohio bands: Brave the Sea and 500 Miles to Memphis. 6 p.m. $15; <a href="/eventbrite.com" target="_blank">eventbrite.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials:</strong> It’s an oldies night — or, rather, day&nbsp;— in Greensburg with Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials headlining a bill with The Crystals and The Marcels (“Blue Moon”). Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials came out of New York in the ’50s with ballads like “Tears on My Pillow” and continued that success into the ’60s with “Goin’ Out of my Head” and “Hurt So Bad.” The Crystals, which features original member Dolores “Dee Dee” Kenniebrew, got the magic Phil Spector touch on hits like “He's a Rebel,” “Da Doo Ron Ron” and “Then He Kissed Me.” Pittsburgh’s entry, The Marcels, are best known for turning “Blue Moon” into a doo-wop song in 1961. The concert is at 3 p.m. at The Palace Theatre. Tickets are $48 to $78. Call 724-836-8000 or go to <a href="/thepalacetheatre.org" target="_blank">thepalacetheatre.org</a>.</p>
