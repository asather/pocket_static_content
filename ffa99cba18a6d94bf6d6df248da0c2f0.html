<h1>Police now unsure if South Fayette man with head injuries was beaten</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Detectives are trying to determine whether a man <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/21/Man-found-severely-beaten-South-Fayette-Ridgepoint-Circle/stories/202006210116" target="_blank">initially reported as&nbsp;“severely beaten”</a> in South Fayette was indeed the victim of a crime.</p>
<p>Police and paramedics responded Sunday around 7:29 a.m. to the 300 block of Ridge Point Circle for a report of a man with severe head injuries who “appeared to be severely beaten,” according to Allegheny County police.</p>
<p>But on Monday, county homicide Lt. Venerando Costa said it was&nbsp;“not conclusive” that the 58-year-old man was beaten.</p>
<p>That information came from first responders at the scene, Lt. Costa said.</p>
<p>After investigating, county homicide detectives found that the man had been at a local bar and went home in a ride-share vehicle, arriving at his apartment building around 1:28 a.m.</p>
<p>“Video surveillance shows the man exiting the vehicle and the vehicle driving away,” county police said.</p>
<p>“The man is seen walking towards his apartment building out of camera view. Detectives were advised by medical personnel that the man had a depressed skull fracture on the rear of his head. Currently detectives are attempting to determine the origin of the head injuries.”</p>
<p>A building resident called 911 later Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The man was taken to the hospital in critical condition.</p>
<p>“Early on in the investigation, it appeared to be a possible assault,”&nbsp;South Fayette police Chief John Phoennik said Monday.&nbsp;“As the investigation unfolded, it appears it may not have been an assault.”</p>
<p>Anyone with information can call the Allegheny County Police Tipline at 1-833-ALL-TIPS (1-833-255-8477).</p>
