<h1>After three consecutive one-run losses, frustration keeps mounting for Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Saturday featured a late comeback that felt short. There wasn’t nearly enough offense on Sunday. And Monday might’ve been the most difficult of the Pirates’ three consecutive one-run losses to stomach.</p>
<p>The Pirates kept the Twins’ big boppers at bay, but their inability to make pitches late cost them another loss, this one a 5-4 defeat at Target Field after Pittsburgh squandered a 4-0 lead.</p>
<p>“It [stunk],” manager Derek Shelton said. “We had the lead and did a couple things that gave the lead back. We put ourselves in a situation where we didn’t execute. Because of our lack of execution, a good team took advantage of that.”</p>
<p>Pitches were the biggest thing the Pirates (2-8) failed to execute, as they walked seven Twins, including three during a disastrous performance from Miguel Del Pozo.</p>
<p>A mistake by Cole Tucker also cost the Pirates a pair of runs, as he misplayed a ball hit right at him in center field.</p>
<p>The results have been tough to take for a team that’s seemingly finding new ways to lose every night. While the Pirates probably didn’t expect to go 8-2 in their first 10, they didn’t expect to go 2-8, either.</p>
<p>“We’re all human, and it stinks,” Tucker said. “But we’ve got two especially really good veteran leaders who have kind of stepped up and helped us young guys get through it with [Jarrod] Dyson and [Derek] Holland.</p>
<p>Minnesota (8-2) rallied in the bottom of the ninth when pinch-hitter Jorge Polanco led off with a single and moved to second on a passed ball.</p>
<p>Tucker and Guillermo Heredia nearly collided on a play, with Heredia recording the out but allowing the runners to move up 90 feet. Nelson Cruz ended it with a double.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, too, because this one should have been about Holland’s quality outing. The left-hander was flat-out unhittable for five innings, commanding his sinker and keeping his off-speed stuff down.</p>
<p>Holland allowed just two singles through five while also striking out five, four of those coming on sinkers.</p>
<p>“I felt like everything was going exactly how I wanted it to,” Holland said. “The game plan was perfect. Did a good job of mixing in and out, making those guys feel a little uncomfortable. It’s just one inning. That’s really what took us out of the game.”</p>
<p>Yeah, that. The sixth. It was brutal.</p>
<p>After retiring the No. 9 hitter, shortstop Ehire Adrianza, Holland walked Twins catcher Mitch Garver. Holland got another out before Cruz singled to right, and Heredia airmailed a throw home, allowing Cruz to take second.</p>
<p>Miguel Sano walked before right fielder Kepler found himself in a hitter’s count at 2-1. Holland had to come with something and left a fastball up in the zone. Kepler crushed it to center, and something the Pirates have been experimenting with during the early part of this season burned them.</p>
<p>Tucker started in on the ball and realized quickly that would be bad news. He sort of slipped and realized he wouldn’t make it back in time.</p>
<p>But Tucker only has a couple weeks of experience playing the outfield and simply made a rookie mistake. The ball sailed over his head, scoring two and trimming the Pirates’ lead to 4-3.</p>
<p>“I was pretty upset about the play in center field,” Tucker said. “That’s a play that should be made.”</p>
<p>If that wasn’t painful enough, there will be plenty of frustration over what came next — and justifiably so.</p>
<p>Into the game came Del Pozo, who was appearing for the fourth time in the past seven days. Shelton said that he liked the matchup, in part because his bullpen has been really banged up.</p>
<p>Del Pozo had been both ineffective and wild, allowing four earned runs and walking five (striking out none) in 1 2/3 innings of work thus far, and his outing went about as you would expect.</p>
<p>Del Pozo issued three consecutive walks and had a wild pitch that made it a 4-4 game, before Shelton mercifully turned things over to Chris Stratton, who escaped the bases-loaded jam thanks to a terrific diving catch from Bryan Reynolds in left.</p>
<p>“We had some guys who didn’t have their ‘A’ stuff, and because they didn’t have their ‘A’ stuff, we ended up getting ourselves some walks,” Shelton said. “The other thing is, I’ve got a pretty good history with the nine guys who are in their lineup over there, and they’re all pretty good professional hitters and they make pitchers work counts. They did a good job of it [Monday].”</p>
<p>Del Pozo, used in a one-run game with the Pirates ahead, has now thrown 72 pitches across four appearances this season, just 34 of them strikes. He’s walked eight of the 14 batters he’s faced.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, too, because the Pirates actually had their offense clicking for once.</p>
<p>Scoring runs early has been a difficult task for the Pirates through their first nine games, as only six of their 30 had come before the seventh inning. But a drastically different lineup spurred some change.</p>
<p>For the first time this season, Shelton went with Tucker atop the lineup, and the converted outfielder whacked the first pitch he saw over the fence.</p>
<p>The fastball from Twins starter Lewis Thorpe — low and inside but still a strike — traveled 402 feet and landed in the left-center field stands for Tucker’s third career homer.</p>
<p>The Pirates doubled their lead in the next inning when they strung together three consecutive singles. The final one, from Jacob Stallings, was well-placed, just out of reach for Twins third baseman Marwin Gonzalez, and it pushed the Pirates ahead, 2-0.</p>
<p>Thorpe began really struggling with his control in the fourth inning, as he walked four. Erik Gonzalez smashed a double the opposite way to score Heredia and help the Pirates grab a 3-0 lead. Phillip Evans singled home Josh Bell in the fifth for a 4-0 Pirates advantage.</p>
<p>“We’re right there,” Holland said. “These guys are young. We’re learning. That’s the big thing, but I can’t say enough great things about these guys, though. We’re competing. We’re busting our [butts] every day.”</p>
