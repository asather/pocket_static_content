<h1>Despite pleas from health officials, public demand grows for masks, santizers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you were to try and order a surgical mask on Home Depot’s website Tuesday afternoon, an alert would’ve appeared informing customers that, “due to current events, supplies are limited.”</p>
<p>A five-pack of “nuisance masks” meant to protect against dust and powders is unavailable for order as they are out of stock in all Home Depot locations within 100 miles of Allegheny County. The same goes for disposable multi-purpose dust masks.</p>
<p>Home Depot began seeing an increase in demand for face masks a little over a month ago — so much so that the Atlanta-based hardware store chain implemented a limited purchase quantity of 10 masks per person, according to Christina Cornell, a company spokeswoman.</p>
<p>The surge in face masks and surgical mask sales is due to the COVID-19 disease outbreak, which has infected 89,000 people across 70 countries, according to Tuesday estimates. As the worldwide death toll reached over 3,000 on Monday, the U.S. toll stood at six victims, all in Washington state.</p>
<p>Health officials from the U.S. Surgeon General to doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned the general public against buying masks. Despite that, major retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe’s are working to expedite health products — face masks, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies — into consumers’ hands.</p>
<p>Drugstore chains are experiencing the same high demand, but Rite Aid spokesperson Chris Savarese told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that those same products are typically in demand during cold and flu season.</p>
<p>“We are experiencing a run on those products due to heavy flu season compiled with the coronavirus outbreak,” Mr. Saverese said.</p>
<p>Rite Aid is doing its best to manage inventory and remain stocked up on healthcare supplies to meet customers’ needs, Mr. Saverese said.</p>
<p>CVS is experiencing similar demand pressure for face masks and cleaning supplies. The demand may “cause temporary shortages of certain products at some store locations and we are re-supplying those stores as quickly as possible,” said Mike DeAngelis, spokesman for CVS Health.</p>
<p>Health officials say the overwhelming demand for masks and other hygenic products is creating a crisis for healthcare works. Over the weekend, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted a stern warning to the public that read: “Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!”</p>
<p>Dr. Adams said face masks are not effective in preventing a COVID-19 infection, and the shortage only hinders healthcare providers who need masks to care for sick patients.</p>
<p>Dr. Adams doubled down on his messaging in an interview with “Fox &amp; Friends” Monday morning explaining that an N95 respirator mask — which the CDC claims filters 95% of airborne particles — requires a “fit test” to be worn correctly and effectively.</p>
<p>A loose-fitting surgical mask, on the other hand, is meant to protect the public from the wearer’s respiratory emissions and not to protect the wearer. The World Health Organization has said masks should only be worn by healthy people who are taking care of someone sick, or someone who is already sick and is coughing and sneezing in public.</p>
<p>CBS News reported last week that masks being offered on Amazon had largely sold out and N95 respirators were being sold at inflated costs.</p>
<p>Health officials warn the best way to try to prevent a COVID-19 infection is to wash your hands regularly, disinfect commonly touched surfaces, cough or sneeze into a tissue and immediately throw it away, avoid shaking hands, and stay home if you’re feeling sick.</p>
