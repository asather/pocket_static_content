<h1>Portion of Nadine Road closed for construction reopens in Penn Hills</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A portion of Nadine Road in Penn Hills that had been closed for more than a month has reopened, Allegheny County officials said Friday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nadine Road had been closed between Lincoln Road and Allegheny River Boulevard/Route 130 since Aug. 10 for construction of two support walls and installation of a drainage pipe.</p>
<p>However, paving work will continue through October and will cause traffic stoppages. Flaggers will provide traffic control.</p>
<p>The overall work, which began Feb. 28, is being done&nbsp;by Northeast Paving in Pittsburgh as&nbsp;part of a $10.7 million capital roads contract.</p>
