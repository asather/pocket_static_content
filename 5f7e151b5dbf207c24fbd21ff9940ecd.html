<h1>UPMC CEO Jeffrey Romoff's salary rises to $8.96 million</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>UPMC President and CEO Jeffrey Romoff received $8.96 million in compensation in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, according to newly filed documents, up almost 5% from $8.54 million the previous year, while 28 other employees of the Pittsburgh-based health&nbsp;system had earnings in excess of $1 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Romoff’s compensation package included $1.2 million in base pay and $3.56 million in bonus and incentive compensation, according to a UPMC Form 990, a record that nonprofit groups are required to submit to the Internal Revenue Service annually.</p>
<p>UPMC declined to comment on the filing.</p>
<p>UPMC’s chief executive oversees a $21 billion nonprofit, which is the largest non-governmental employer in Pennsylvania with 40 hospitals and more than 90,000 employees. Like crosstown rival Highmark, UPMC also operates a health insurer — UPMC Health Plan.</p>
<p>David Holmberg, president and CEO of Pittsburgh-based Highmark Health, received $7.49 million in total compensation, which included $1.4 million in base pay and $5.47 million in bonus and incentive pay, according to that organization’s most recent filing.</p>
<p>Those earning more than $1 million in total compensation, according to UPMC’s filing, included Diane Holder, president and CEO of UPMC Health Plan, $3.2 million; Steve Shapiro, executive vice president and chief medical and science officer, $2.6 million; and James Luketich, chair and board member of the&nbsp;Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, $2.4 million.</p>
<p>UPMC posted its <a href="https://upmc.me/3gLdjQx" target="_blank">Form 990</a> to its website Friday, where it’s available for public review.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Like many health care operations, UPMC has had a challenging start to 2020, reporting a $653 million loss over the first three months of the year, including a $41 million operating loss largely related to the COVID-19 pandemic, network officials reported in May. First quarter operating revenue of $5.5 billion compared with $5.1 billion during the period a year earlier.</p>
