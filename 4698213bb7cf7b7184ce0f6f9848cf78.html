<h1>Gene Therapy: Tulsa rally Trump's worst idea yet, and that's saying something</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Before June even had its legs, I punctuated a column in this space with the observation that it was almost painfully difficult to determine which was more important right now, that the president stop talking, or that we stop listening. We might be about to find out.</p>
<p>Unless someone comes to their senses in these next few hours, America’s first indoor mass gathering of the pandemic will convene in Tulsa, Okla., not because Tulsa is relatively free of the virus, but in spite of an acceleration in cases so frightening that visitors to the city’s new BOK Center had to agree not to sue the main attraction should they contract a potentially lethal pathogen.</p>
<p>Who could even imagine staging such an event in this place at this time? Who else? The fine folks at Donald J. Trump For President, CSU (can’t sue us). Sure looks better on the tickets than Bio-Terrorism Expo 2020, wouldn’t you say?</p>
<p>This is irrefutably Trump’s Worst Idea of the Month, a significant accomplishment in that it’s from the same guy who tear-gassed his own people on June 1 to clear an area adjacent to the White House for an incoherent photo-op. Here’s how stunningly, irredeemably bad this caper is. Consider that in Jacksonville, Fla., this month, 16 friends gathered in a freshly reopened Irish pub to celebrate a birthday. Know how many got the virus? Sixteen. At a choir practice in Washington, 61 people convened in a church for a few hours to do what choirs do – stand in close proximity and sing. Fifty-three contracted coronovirus. Two died. Tonight in Tulsa, the Trump campaign will welcome not 16, not 63, but 19,000 people into a concrete bunker for a few hours of screaming and shouting, masks optional, a space where the so-called attack-rate of the virus can be very high.</p>
<p>How many will be infected, and how many people will those people infect at the end of all relevant contact tracing, inadequate as it surely will be? Why would anyone even contemplate such insanity?</p>
<p>Legal attempts to stop what Mr. Trump sees as a long overdue adulationfest began in Oklahoma this week. Lawyers warned of “a super-spreader event,” and Bruce Dart, director of the Tulsa Health Department, went on record with this: “It’s the perfect storm of potential over-the-top disease transmission; it’s a perfect storm that we can’t afford to have.”</p>
<p>But don’t think for a moment it won’t attract an almost equally irresponsible gusher of coverage, particularly by cable news channels who should be examining what remains of their consciences on the question of whether they’re willing to put their own employees in potentially grave danger in the service of a preening narcissist.</p>
<p>Journalists and assignment editors grapple with staffing issues frequently when the news is deemed important enough to risk injury and even death, but not to assist someone engaged in exhibitionist solipsism, even if it is the President of the United States. Further, there is no story here, politically. Mr. Trump needs a visit to Oklahoma like he needs another lawyer. Nothing is at stake. Every county in Oklahoma voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. What you’re covering here is the metaphorically equivalent of a tired, frustrated old man finally getting to take a bubble bath.</p>
<p>At Trump rallies, most of the program is devoted to spirited evisceration of his enemies, particularly the truth. They do not even warrant coverage any more, but in a data-driven mediascape, Mr. Trump still moves the ratings needle, which obliterates all other considerations.</p>
<p>Even health considerations apparently.</p>
<p>Asked this week by the New York Times what he made of the media’s handle on this particular moment, former “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart got the knife out:</p>
<p>“I don’t think it has ever had a good handle on a political moment. It’s not designed for that. It’s designed for engagement. It’s like Youtube and Facebook, an information-laundering, perpetual-radicalization machine. . . . The algorithm is not designed for thoughtful engagement and clarity. It’s designed to make you look at it longer.”</p>
<p>The toxic relationship between the media and Mr. Trump has as its primary carcinogens both the cable media’s preference for ratings over truth and the fact that, among Mr. Trump’s precious few abilities, is a twisted knack for getting attention and keeping it, especially if he can simultaneously close the curtain on a story that’s even less flattering.</p>
<p>It surprised just about nobody that John Bolton’s soon-to-be-published book includes an anecdote describing the president’s illogical tweets about the bone saw murder of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi. By seeming to defend a Saudi regime identified by U.S. intelligence as the likely perps, the president was motivated by unflattering coverage of Ivanka Trump, according to Mr. Bolton. The Ivanka story alleged she used a personal account to send hundreds of emails to government officials, a violation of federal records laws. In other words, the very thing he liked to point out about Hillary Clinton, the cue for his rally crowds to chant, “Lock her up!”</p>
<p>“This will divert from Ivanka,” Mr. Bolton quotes Mr. Trump as saying. “If I read the statement in person, that will take over the Ivanka thing.”</p>
<p>And he was right.</p>
<p>What might be the next distraction? What can you do to divert attention from the fact that you potentially just exposed 19,000 people to a killer virus? I don’t even want to imagine, but it’ll get great coverage.</p>
