<h1>Pirates playing it as safe as possible with injuries to key players</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It is no secret the Pirates have struggled with various injury problems this season.</p>
<p>The last thing they need, then, is more players heading to the injured list. That was the fear when right-hander Keone Kela (right forearm discomfort) and infielders Kevin Newman (lower right abdominal discomfort) and Colin Moran (concussion protocol) suffered apparent injuries in the past week.</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton attempted to quash those fears a bit, saying that all three were with the team and available for their series against the Chicago White Sox, which started Tuesday.</p>
<p>However, after none of the three appeared in the series opener and Moran and Newman were left out of the starting lineup again Wednesday, the questions about the players’ health and what exactly is going on here arose again.</p>
<p>“Keone Kela has yet to pick up a baseball from throwing,” said the Pirates’ director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk. “He’s making some strides in the overall decrease of the tightness but he’s yet to play catch.&nbsp;Kevin Newman, he was available to play last night, as Derek said last night. He is available to play [Wednesday], as well.</p>
<p>“Colin Moran, as we all are sensitive to with concussion or any type of head injuries, these are very fluid situations. At this moment or at this time, we are evaluating him for some concussion-like symptoms. So the availability is unknown at this point in time.”</p>
<p>So, then, it would appear only one of the three — Newman — is really available, even if Kela and Moran have not been placed on the injured list to this point.</p>
<p>Tomczyk explained some of the mixed messages Wednesday, specifically with Moran and Kela. For Moran, things are simply changing day to day.</p>
<p>“With any type of injury to the head, sometimes symptoms resolve,” Tomczyk said. “Once they do resolve, we make a medical assessment with our physicians and medical group, then we address them accordingly. Then you monitor. If symptoms re-arise, you pivot and make other decisions to put both the short- and long-term health of that player. In Colin’s instance, he is experiencing symptoms once again, at this moment, and we are still assessing him at this time.”</p>
<p>Tomczyk explained that Kela is not feeling any pain in his right forearm, specifically, the part of his arm that he was clutching when he left last Friday’s game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Kela is still feeling general arm tightness, which is why he has yet to throw a baseball since suffering the bump.</p>
<p>“I think first and foremost, for Keone and for the player’s mindset, he’s going to want to be able to throw,” Tomczyk said. “I think as we all can attest to, these things can change quite rapidly. Once that mindset, the comfort, the symptoms completely resolve, he will throw. I know Keone wants to pitch. He’s shared that with all of us. He just wants to be out there and be with his teammates and do the thing he loves to do, and that’s play baseball.”</p>
<p>Shelton chose not to discuss the injuries any further Wednesday, instead yielding those answers to Tomczyk. That does not change the idea, however, that there seem to be differing interpretations of the players’ readiness.</p>
<p>At the very least, they may be technically available to play, but are still working through their own injury issues. If they weren’t, they would likely have been in the lineup against the White Sox.</p>
<p><strong>Further injury updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>RHP Joe Musgrove (right triceps inflammation):&nbsp;</strong>Scheduled to throw a simulated game at the alternate training site in Altoona in the coming days.</p>
<p><strong>RHP Mitch Keller (left oblique strain):&nbsp;</strong>Threw a side bullpen session Tuesday. Continues to make progress.</p>
<p><strong>RHP Kyle Crick (right shoulder strain):&nbsp;</strong>Threw a live batting practice session on Monday and again Wednesday. Tomczyk said the signs are positive and that Crick&nbsp;“continues to check all the boxes off.”</p>
<p><strong>RHP Jameson Taillon (Tommy John surgery):&nbsp;</strong>In a rather large, positive milestone, Taillon will be throwing his first live batting practice session since undergoing surgery sometime in the next few days. That will also take place in Altoona.</p>
<p><strong>RHP Yacksel Rios (right shoulder inflammation):&nbsp;</strong>Tomczyk said Rios has thrown for three consecutive days without a hitch. He will take a day off Wednesday before continuing with his throwing program after that.</p>
<p><strong>INF Phillip Evans (broken jaw):&nbsp;</strong>Evans underwent surgery last week, and though his post-operation meetings have been positive, Tomczyk said, his jaw is still wired shut. He is still expected to make a full recovery.</p>
