<h1>Lunar New Year Parade in Squirrel Hill rescheduled for March 1</h1>

<p>Pittsburgh’s annual Lunar New Year Parade in Squirrel Hill, which was postponed Sunday in light of the recent coronavirus outbreak, has been rescheduled, according to Marian Lien, a parade organizer and president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans.</p>
<p>Ms. Lien said the parade is supposed to be a “joyous” event. With illness plaguing Pittsburgh’s sister city Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei Province, she said it didn’t feel right to be “jumping up and down in the streets.”</p>
<p>The annual parade, in its fifth year, has been rescheduled for March 1.</p>
<p>Organizations involved in the event’s planning announced the decision to postpone in a press release on Feb. 5. Permits have since been successfully rescheduled.</p>
<p>Ms. Lien said organizers decided to postpone the festivities so community members could focus their energy on the crisis —&nbsp;contacting friends, family and colleagues in China, and fundraising to send medical supplies to the region.</p>
<p>Ms. Lien emphasized that the event had not been postponed due to contamination fears.</p>
<p>There have been just 12 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States as of Monday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No cases have been confirmed in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Ms. Lien, who is also the director of education for inclusion and global awareness at St. Edmund’s Academy in Squirrel Hill, said Asian and Asian American students have faced xenophobia and racism in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Classmates asked one college student to put on a mask to attend class, even though the student had not recently been to China. Another said dormmates asked her to move to a single room, said Ms. Lien.</p>
<p>Ms. Lien said it's affecting businesses, too. One local Chinese restaurant owner told Ms. Lien that his profits were as much as 50% lower than they should be at this time of year.</p>
<p>Most of Allegheny County’s nearly 20,000 Asian residents are Chinese, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. About 200 to 300 of them are descendants of Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei Province, according to members of the Pittsburgh Hubei Fellow Association.</p>
<p>For those looking to help relief efforts, Ms. Lien said the Wuhan government asked that the public send supplies directly to the New York City consulate, who will then ship equipment to areas in need. She recommends donating to an organization like the Brother’s Brother Foundation.</p>
<p>The rescheduled parade will take place on Murray Avenue around noon on March 1, and will conclude the two weeks of Spring Festival activities. The public event is free of charge.</p>
<p>Lunar New Year PGH is a partnership between Squirrel Hill Urban Coalition, Uncover Squirrel Hill, Jewish Family &amp; Community Service, Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh and the OCA Advocates for Asian Pacific Americans.</p>
