<h1>Local blood bank calling for donations as blood drives cancel due to COVID-19 </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Due to COVID-19 social distancing precautions and school closings, several local blood drives have been canceled – creating an urgent need for donors by local blood banks.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Vitalant, a non-profit community blood service provider with locations in Pittsburgh, stated in a press release on Wednesday that they are&nbsp;“struggling to maintain stable inventories” and are trying to avoid a critical blood shortage. According to its website, Vitalant has resulted in a loss of around 2,000 blood products – and counting.</p>
<p>Blood donations are still regularly needed for patients with cancer, trauma, obstetrics, surgery, according to Dr. Darrell Triulzi, a medical director at Vitalant, in the press release. And with the recent decrease in blood donations, Vitalant’s supply has been quickly disappearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Vitalant provides blood to UPMC and AHN hospitals so that those who donate through Vitalant can feel proud that their blood stays right here in our community,” said Kristin Lead, a spokesperson for Vitalant, in the release. “But whether people donate blood through Vitalant or ARC they are saving lives and serving the greater good, especially during this pandemic when blood is in critical need across the country.”</p>
<p>Although blood centers do not test potential donors for COVID-19, those who are feeling healthy are still encouraged to donate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiple safety precautions are reportedly being followed at Vitalant’s blood banks. Joseph E. Kiss, a medical director of Clinical Apheresis and Blood Services at Vitalant, stated in the release that blood donors are screened to ensure they are healthy, its staff follows “rigorous disinfection protocols between donations,” and follow public health recommendations for social distancing.</p>
<p>According to the American Red Cross (ARC), there is no data or evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted by blood transfusion. The ARC also stated that there have been <a href="https://www.redcross.org/about-us/news-and-events/press-release/2020/red-cross-media-statement-on-2019-novel-coronavirus.html" target="_blank">no reported cases of transmissions</a> for any respiratory virus, including COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who are interested in donating can schedule a blood donation appointment by calling 877-25-4852 or on its website vitalant.org.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bank has also announced they are <a href="https://www.vitalant.org/Engage/Engage-1/Events/Pennsylvania-Pittsburgh/Extended-Hours-at-Donation-Centers.aspx" target="_blank">expanding hours at multiple donations centers</a>&nbsp;in Butler, Cranberry, Downtown, Greensburg, Harmar/Fox Chapel, Monroeville, Moon Township, North Hills, South Hills, and Parkway Center in Greentree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All blood types and components are needed, especially including platelets and type O blood donations – since platelets have a short 5-day shelf life and type O-negative blood is a universal blood type.&nbsp;</p>
