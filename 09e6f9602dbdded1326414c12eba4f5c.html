<h1>The other plague </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As COVID-19 rages on, another plague of biblical proportions has been ravaging East Africa, Pakistan and India, and parts of South America — locust swarms.</p>
<p>The insects have been appearing in record numbers, stripping fields and destroying crops at a remarkable pace. The swarms have already caused billions of dollars in damage and are threatening the food security of millions. The potential for famine, poverty and death is high. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization — FOA — estimates that the latest swarms threaten the livelihoods of 10% of the world’s population.</p>
<p>Combating locust swarms is a time-consuming and expensive process. Locust swarms occur so infrequently that maintaining long-term supplies of locust-control tools is impractical. That means cash-strapped countries such as Kenya have to find a way to fund unplanned mass aerial pesticide sprays — made all the more difficult by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has strained global resources and supply chains.</p>
<p>And, because of the scale of the sprays necessary to fight the swarms, there will still be adverse effects on the environment and public health that will require government attention to avoid long-term damage.</p>
<p>The FOA has launched an effort to facilitate pesticide deliveries and other aid for the countries affected by the locust swarms. The project has already raised more than half of the $300 million the FOA estimates is needed. The remaining $150 million should be handled quickly by some combination of the world’s richest nations and its richest people. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who makes in excess of $200 million a day, could give up less than his day’s allowance to protect millions of jobs and lives.</p>
<p>The world has been stretched thin as it deals with COVID-19 and other emergencies, but the devastation wrought by locust swarms throughout the world cannot be ignored. Action must be taken, and soon.</p>
