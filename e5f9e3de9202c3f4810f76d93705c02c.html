<h1>Paul Zeise: PGA Tour gives some much-needed reasons for optimism about return of sports</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The sports world has been on hold for about a month now, courtesy of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Since then, we have been treated to an endless stream of old games, events and NFL Films-like documentaries on all the sports channels. (As an aside, could we stop showing that Packers-Steelers Super Bowl from a few years ago? I’ve seen that too many times now and, frankly, the Steelers seem to stink more in that game every time I watch it.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are all going stir crazy, all of us who enjoy sports or, in my case, cover and talk about sports for a living. And that’s why any positive news has been jumped on and created some optimism.</p>
<p>We look to South Korea, where they are now playing baseball again, albeit with some restrictions and wearing masks. We were all very excited about the China Basketball Association calling all the players back to start up the season again. Of course, there have been three delays to the actual start of said season, and that has caused us to lose some hope.</p>
<p>There have been some discussions of horse racing coming back without fans. I’d suspect people who couldn’t even tell you the difference between a trifecta and exacta would suddenly become horse racing fans just because it would be live sports to watch. The same thing with NASCAR, as the&nbsp;“all they do is turn left” crowd would be counting down the days until the first live race.</p>
<p>But along came the PGA Tour to give a far more specific brand of optimism. That’s because there is an actual schedule for a return and a plan to play at least the first handful of tournaments without fans. I don’t care about fans getting into the events; let’s just get the events back and then worry about how to get fans in.</p>
<p>The first event on the adjusted schedule the PGA Tour announced Monday is the Memorial in Dublin, Ohio. That’s a great event to start with, and my guess is this will be the most star-studded field in the tournament’s history. I can’t imagine anyone is sitting this one out since it is the first one we will have had in almost three months.</p>
<p>The Memorial is June 4-7, which means with practice rounds and whatever they do with media leading up to it, sports are set to return June 1. Hey, I know it isn’t what people want to hear, but it is realistic and it is a date that I think is actually possible to return from this hiatus.</p>
<p>I would be very suspicious if they were talking about coming back next week, or even the first week of May. That doesn’t seem possible based on what the experts are saying about the curve and the peak of the pandemic. I also would be very suspicious if the plan was to return with full crowds and galleries of fans (there won’t be any fans at the Memorial).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn’t ideal but it is the first solid bit of good news we have heard about sports in a few weeks. The Open Championship (British Open for those of you older than, say, 30) will be canceled completely. The Masters, though, will be played Nov. 12-15, the PGA Championship is Aug 6-9 and the U.S Open Sept. 17-20.&nbsp; And the Ryder Cup is still set for Sept. 25-27.</p>
<p>It stinks not having an Open Championship, but given what we have been through this year, I’m ecstatic that we probably will still get three major championships and the Ryder Cup. Now, there is the caveat that comes with everything these days—- all of this is pending the blessing of elected and public health officials.</p>
<p>There are actually people complaining that there will be too many sporting events jammed into the fall. Are you serious? Are you kidding me? After what we have been through the past month, I’d sign up to watch sports that started at 3 a.m. right about now.</p>
<p>How is that a bad thing? I understand we are a long way from the Memorial on June 1st and a lot can happen between now and then, but at least now we have a schedule and something to look forward to, courtesy of the PGA Tour. I’ll take that and run with it and hope that we have more of these kinds of announcements in the upcoming days and weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
