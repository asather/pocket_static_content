<h1>Employers can defer payroll taxes for next 4 months, but they will have to pay later</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON — After a month with no deal from Congress to extend COVID-19 relief programs, employers will have the option beginning on Tuesday to defer withholding of payroll taxes for the next four months, a move by President Donald Trump intended to unilaterally provide benefits after talks among lawmakers broke down.</p>
<p>But it remains unclear how many employers will decide to defer collection and payment of such taxes, especially after a coalition of business groups on the national level called the idea&nbsp;“unfair” and&nbsp;“unworkable.”</p>
<p>One of the chief complaints is that the taxes will ultimately have to be paid by next April. Because&nbsp;Congress has the sole power to reduce taxes, the Trump administration has the authority only to shift when tax payments are collected. While paychecks would be larger during the deferral period from Sept. 1 until Dec. 31, paychecks would be smaller during the first four months of 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an Aug. 18 letter to Congress and the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and more than 30 trade associations wrote that many of their members will likely decline to defer the tax. The letter estimated workers making $50,000 a year could owe nearly $1,100 in payroll taxes in 2021.</p>
<p>“Many of our members consider it unfair to employees to make a decision that would force a big tax bill on them next year,” the organizations wrote.&nbsp;“It would also be unworkable to implement a system where employees make this decision.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, who has long said he wants to cut payroll taxes, included the deferment in a package of executive orders signed on Aug. 8, a week after talks broke down on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Among the deferment option and eviction protections, the president ordered an extension of supplemental unemployment benefits using funds transferred from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania labor officials, whose application was approved last week to receive a&nbsp;$1.5 billion FEMA grant, are <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/08/18/unemployment-benefits-FPUC-extra-300-Pennsylvania-Dept-of-Labor-and-Industry-Trump-executive-order/stories/202008180107" target="_blank">racing to build a new system</a> to provide a supplemental $300 a week benefit — half the $600 weekly benefit that was set up by Congress in March and expired at the end of July.</p>
<p>The payroll tax deferral, which was not among any congressional relief package, is the most controversial move.</p>
<p>Guidance published late Friday by the Internal Revenue Service&nbsp;confirmed employers would, beginning in January, eventually have to withhold and pay any payroll taxes that were deferred beginning Sept. 1.&nbsp;The deferral would be eligible to any employee whose pretax wages or compensation during any biweekly pay period is less than $4,000.</p>
<p>Business groups have repeatedly called on Congress to provide tax relief, among other provisions, in an upcoming COVID-19 package. Lawmakers in both parties have expressed opposition to a payroll tax cut in any new legislation.</p>
<p>Reached Monday, the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 1,500 small businesses in Pennsylvania, declined to take a stance on the payroll tax deferment. The group is focusing on <a href="https://assets.nfib.com/nfibcom/NFIB-Phase-Four-Legislative-Priorities.pdf" target="_blank">legislative priorities</a> to be passed by Congress and signed by the president, a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>
