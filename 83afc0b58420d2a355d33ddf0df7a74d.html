<h1>Fishing Report: Brown trout taken in Hampton, steelhead waiting for weather on Erie tributaries</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Post-Christmas steelhead runs typically attract fewer but bigger fish. The broader creeks were blown out during the weekend, but generally in recent weeks the cold green snow melt flowing through Lake Erie tributaries created extraordinary conditions for winter anglers.</p>
<p>“The past two weeks have been nothing short of amazing, producing double digit [catches] each trip,” said Dave Hawk of Ross.</p>
<p>Casting flies, he landed 42 steelhead in seven hours. Fishing buddy Jim Stillwagon, also of the North Hills, landed 20 the same day.</p>
<p>“The big shocker —&nbsp;we landed 30-inch-plus tanks that day,” said Mr. Hawk. “The tribs had a nice green stain along with good flow and ideal water temperatures, which seems to have certainly turned [the fish’s] feed bags on. … We have both noticed a much larger and healthier school of steelies than in previous years.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hawk said the hot patterns were white and pink Crystal Meth eggs, pink Sucker Spawn and Ug Bugs.</p>
<p>“After countless fly changes, we found what they wanted, and the feeding frenzy was on,” he said. “Couldn’t have asked for a better day on the water.”</p>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County) Midweek anglers waited for expected rain and snow to revive low clear creeks. Dark chromers and fresh steel waited in deep pools for better flow, and good catches on egg sacs and jigs were reported on Walnut Creek. Fly anglers used egg patterns and minnow imitations. Yellow perch were reported at the South Pier and Perry’s Landing, and perch and panfish were pulled off Presque Isle weedlines using tipped jigs. There was no ice on the bay. Mixed precipitation is expected Saturday, including 1-3 inches of morning snow.</p>
<p><strong>French Creek</strong> (Venango County) Walleye and northerns went for live bait.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Arthur</strong> (Butler County) A kayak angler from Butler paddled among woody cover and released two largemouths and a yellow perch using a spinning rod and tipped jigs on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Creek Lake</strong> (Indiana County) During the warm spell northern pike, bluegill and sunfish were taken on shiners.</p>
<p><strong>Little Yellow Creek</strong> (Indiana County) Morning anglers caught brook trout using wax worms.</p>
<p><strong>North Park Lake</strong> (Allegheny County) Families took advantage of the recent warm weekend, and many kids tossed out bobbers and bait, although there were no reports of noteworthy catches.</p>
<p><strong>Pine Creek</strong> (Allegheny County) During last week’s unseasonable 73-degree Saturday, Scott Kozelnik of McCandless released three trout, including a 13½-inch brown, on a Panther Martin spinner and Trout Worm teaser.</p>
