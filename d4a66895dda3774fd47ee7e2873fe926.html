<h1>West Mifflin Area School District ap­proves trans­gen­der guide­lines </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The West Mifflin Area School District’s school board has approved administrative guidelines for transgender and gender-expansive students in the district.</p>
<p>Board member Matthew Blazevich had called for the guidelines in February, saying they would “reduce the stigma of transgender and gender identity issues.”</p>
<p>After months of work by the board’s policy committee and their solicitor, the guidelines were unanimously approved during the board’s Aug. 20 virtual meeting.</p>
<p>The 12-page set of guidelines states: “The district shall ensure that transgender and gender expansive students are provided with an equal opportunity to achieve their maximum potential through district programs, as well as provided with equal access to all school programs and activities.”</p>
<p>It also outlines that “harassment, bullying and discrimination on the basis of actual or preferred sex, sexual orientation or gender identity or expression shall be prohibited in the district.”</p>
<p>The guidelines also provide for students’ rights to privacy, including keeping a student’s actual or perceived gender identity and expression private.</p>
<p>The document states that school personnel should not disclose information about a transgender or gender-expansive student’s gender identity and expression to others — including the student’s parents or ​guardians and/​or other school personnel, unless legally required to do so or unless the student has authorized such disclosure.</p>
<p>Additionally, the guidelines state that students have the right to be addressed by their preferred gender pronoun and that every student has the right to be addressed by a name and pronoun that corresponds to the student’s gender identity.</p>
<p>Also, to the extent possible, the guidelines state that the district and schools “should use gender neutral” language in written communication regardless of a student’s gender identity — which includes using “they” instead of “he/​she.”</p>
<p>“I especially want to thank the [Gay Straight Alliance], the GSA members and leaders,” Mr. Blazevich said of the guidelines, which are a step short of district policy. “If it wasn’t for them and our GSA students and their courage and genuine advocacy and commitment for this, I don’t know if this would have happened.”</p>
<p>Board member Jonathan Mattis, who sits on the board’s policy committee, also thanked everyone involved with making the transgender guidelines a reality.</p>
<p>He went on to urge district Superintendent Jeffrey Soles to make sure that even though school is starting remotely for the first nine weeks this year, staff and faculty are trained on the new guidelines.</p>
<p>“This is only the beginning,” Mr. Mattis said.</p>
