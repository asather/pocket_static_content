<h1>Signs are pointing to a Rolling Stones show in Pittsburgh this summer</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Keep an eye out for tongues.</p>
<p>They’ll turn up on local billboards indicating that The Rolling Stones plan to play Pittsburgh this summer.</p>
<p>Fan sites are reporting that Pittsburgh is rumored to be on the list for the No Filter 2020 tour, expected to run May through July. It would be the band’s first stop here since 2015 when they played Heinz Field on the Zip Code Tour. The Stones played 15 North American cities last summer.</p>
<p><a href="https://iorr.org/talk/list.php?1" target="_blank">The Rolling Stones Fan Club - It's Only Rock'n Roll</a> posted this week that the rumored cities are San Diego, St. Louis, Cleveland, Louisville, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Baltimore, Nashville, Charlotte, Tampa, Atlanta and Vancouver. They are projecting a June 21 date for Louisville.</p>
<p>Another site, <a href="https://songmango.com/stones-finalizing-tour-plans-dates-and-venues-to-come/" target="_blank">SongMango</a>, had a similar post and noted that an official tour announcement is expected on or around Thursday.</p>
<p>These fan sites were the first to leak the news the last time the Stones played here, followed by the Stones’ tongue logo on billboards a few days before the announcement.&nbsp;There has been no official word from AEG, which is promoting the tour.</p>
