<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Upper St. Clair School District and the district’s support staff union have ratified a new five-year collective bargaining agreement, effective Sept. 1.</p>
<p>The Upper St. Clair Special Service Federation — which&nbsp;represents 155 workers including custodians, maintenance, mechanics, teacher aides, secretaries and nutrition center staff — ratified the agreement June 25, and the district school board unanimously approved the contract June 29.</p>
<p>Salary increases throughout the five-year plan range from 1.5% to 3% with an overall average of 2.35%. The new contract is set through June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>“The union negotiation team was tremendous to work with — our staff really appreciated their professionalism, understanding and collaboration,” Dr. John Rozzo, superintendent of schools, said in a release. “We are proud to have reached an agreement that is mutually beneficial and fair to both sides as well as to the community.”</p>
<p>The school district established several goals for the contract, including recruiting and retaining highly qualified employees, rewarding classroom performance and investing in safety.</p>
<p>Walt Michalski, AFT Pennsylvania staff representative, said at the school board meeting the negotiators were determined to make progress by summer, but were surprised by closures brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“A lot of times, we’ll hear at the table that the board and the administration appreciate the work of the unit, but you guys showed it as well in how you really put your shoulder to the wheel and worked to get things done,” Mr. Michalski said.</p>
