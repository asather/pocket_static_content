<h1>Billie Eilish has historic night at the Grammys with six wins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The awards handed out on Music’s Biggest Night didn’t seem quite as important on a tragic day in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, NBA legend Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna Maria and seven other people died in a helicopter crash, putting a pall over the 62nd annual Grammy Awards at the Staples Center.</p>
<p>“We’re standing here heartbroken in the house that Kobe Bryant built,” host Alicia Keys said in a classy introduction that included a stirring duet with Boyz II Men.</p>
<p>“Here we are together, on music’s biggest night, celebrating the artists who do it best. But to be honest, we’re all feeling crazy sadness right now. … We never imagined in a million years we’d have to start the show like this.”</p>
<p>As always, though, the show must go on, and Keys promised, correctly, that there would be great music, joy and laughter, not to mention the craziness that ensues when characters like Tyler, the Creator, Lizzo and the Aerosmith-Run DMC are in the house.</p>
<p>Lizzo, the year’s biggest breakout star, came in with a leading eight nominations, including best new artist, even though she’s been bouncing around since 2013. She kicked off the show in bold fashion with an orchestral “Cuz I Love You” and a funky “Truth Hurts,” while also showing, with flute, that she could fill in for Jethro Tull in a pinch. The R&amp;B/hip-hop artist went home with her first Grammys: pop solo performance, urban contemporary album, traditional R&amp;B performance.</p>
<p>The major awards, however, went to another 2019 breakout, 18-year-old electropop star Billie Eilish, sporting neon green roots. She was nominated for six and won them all, becoming the youngest artist to ever win album of the year, for “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” She also won best new artist, song of the year (“Bad Guy”), pop vocal album and best engineered album, non-classical, joining Beyonce and Adele as the only female artists to win six Grammys in one night.</p>
<p>Like a lot of other people, she was shocked. “So many other songs deserve this,” she said, accepting for “Bad Guy,” “I’m sorry.” Later, accepting album of the year, she said, “Can I just say I think Ariana deserves this?”</p>
<p>Rather than doing “Bad Guy,” she went more understated with a tender reading of “When the Party’s Over,” joined by brother Finneas O’Connell on piano.</p>
<p>Lil Nas X, also nominated for six, delivered one of the night’s flashiest performances, joined by Billy Ray Cyrus, of course, and — surprise — BTS&nbsp; on a rousing “Old Town Road.” The 20-year-old rapper-singer from Georgia won his first Grammys, as well, for best duo/group performance and best music video.</p>
<p>Dan + Shay got their prime-time moment at the Grammys, accepting the award for best country duo/group performance for “Speechless.” The duo features McCandless native and North Allegheny High School and Carnegie Mellon University grad Dan Smyers, who had a previous life in the Christian rock band Transition before moving to Nashville and hooking up with Shay Mooney to become country hitmakers.</p>
<p>They won their first Grammy last year for the single “Tequila” and now follow with a win for “Speechless,” which topped the country charts and went to No. 24 on the Hot 100.</p>
<p>“I’m going to put my heart up to this microphone,” Smyers said, accepting the award. “You can literally hear it beating out of my chest right now. This is one of my coolest moments ever. Thank you to my wife, Abby, who’s in the crowd down there, for inspiring this song, for inspiring every song we write, for inspiring everything we do in our lives.”</p>
<p>Dan + Shay’s hopes for best country song went to Tanya Tucker, winning her first Grammy at 61, 48 years after her first nomination. (The other Pittsburgh connections — the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and hip-hop duo Social House, nominated with Ariana Grande — did not win in their categories.)</p>
<p>Tucker, enjoying a career revival at 61, earned her first Grammy nomination in 1972. On Sunday night, she finally won — best country album for “While I’m Livin’” and best country song for “Bring My Flowers Now” —&nbsp;with her first studio material in 19 years.</p>
<p>“After 50 years in this business, I have a few firsts left,” she said in her speech. “I can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>Also at the Grammys:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Rapper Tyler, the Creator was responsible for one of the evening’s most unhinged moments (doing “Earfquake” with Charlie Wilson and Boyz II Men) and one of the sweetest, bringing his mom on stage to collect his first Grammy — best rap album for “Igor.” “To my mother,” he said, “you did a great job raising this guy.”</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Guitar blazer Gary Clark Jr. won best rock song and best rock performance for “This Land,” a searing protest song he did with The Roots depicting a racist experience he suffered on his farm. He also won best contemporary blues album for “This Land,” which was deserving of an album of the year nomination.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Tool lost best rock song to Clark but did win best metal performance for the 12-minute epic “7empest.” Accepting the award, drummer Danny Carey said, “I want to thank the gods, all of ’em. It’s probably not a good time to piss any of ’em off” and named three “great drum gods”: Jon Bonham, Tony Williams and “my good friend Neil Peart,” the Rush drummer who died earlier this month.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Elvis Costello, who should have won about a dozen Grammys, won his second, in an unlikely category — best traditional pop vocal album — given his punk origins. With Tony Bennett taking a rare year off from the category, he topped three-time winner Michael Buble and Barbara Streisand.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Mac Miller was a posthumous nominee in the rap section last year for “Swimming” but lost to Cardi B. This year, Nipsey Hussle, who was shot and killed in March in front of his LA store at 33, received a big all-star tribute and got the win: best rap performance for “Racks in the Middle” as well as best rap/sung performance with Khaled for “Higher.”</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Pittsburgh’s Billy Porter, in an electric blue suit Bowie would have loved, had a moment, introducing the Jonas Brothers, saying, ‘“Ladies! Gentlemen! And those who’ve yet to make up their minds!” More surprising was the Jonases pulling out a Bo Diddley beat.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Demi Lovato, who has had her personal struggles, had one of the night’s most triumphant moments, choking up on a powerhouse and emotionally wrenching “Anyone.” Also turning on the emotion were Ariana Grande and Camila Cabello, the latter doing a tribute to her father with “First Man.”</p>
<p>•&nbsp;On a night that showcased the industry’s young pop talents, one of the hottest performances came from wily veterans Aerosmith (minus drummer Joey Kramer) and Run DMC reviving their groundbreaking 1986 mashup on “Walk This Way.” Bringing in Lizzo on the chorus and displaying the Kobe jersey added to the moment.</p>
