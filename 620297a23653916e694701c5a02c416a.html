<h1>U.S. Steel restarting blast furnaces amid uptick in demand</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>U.S. Steel said it will restart its idled #6 blast furnace at its Gary Works in Indiana after the July 4 holiday weekend to meet an upturn in demand.</p>
<p>The move follows the restart of the #1 blast furnace at the steelmaker’s Edgar Thomson plant in the Mon Valley in early June.</p>
<p>Both furnaces were temporarily shuttered in late April due to lower demand during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We remain ready to serve our customers as they adjust to changing market conditions by utilizing the flexibility of our banked blast furnaces, including if needed, adjusting operations intermittently to accommodate changes in our order book,” spokeswoman Meghan Cox said in an email Thursday.</p>
