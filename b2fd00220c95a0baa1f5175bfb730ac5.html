<p>A Sewickley woman was sentenced to five years and four months in prison after she was convicted of embezzling approximately $8.7 million over nine years while employed as the controller for Marco Contractor Inc., the U.S. Attorney’s office announced Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to information presented in court, Sue O’Neill, 55, and another individual, identified only as R.G., started a company in 2014 called Bulldog Contractors LLC. R.G. has not been charged or further identified, however online records indicate that Bulldog is owned by Robin L. Gabel.</p>
<p>The case represents one of the largest embezzlement schemes uncovered in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>O’Neill used $6.7 million of the stolen funds to support her new business venture, according to the U.S. Attorney’s office. O’Neill kept the other $2 million of embezzled funds for her personal bank account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, O’Neill <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/11/13/marco-contractors-embezzlement-controller-sue-oneill-guilty-allegheny-county/stories/201911130153" target="_blank">admitted in federal court</a> that she stole the money and didn’t report the extra income on her taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Attorney’s office, the court was advised that O’Neill and her partner R.G. purchased “two 1969 Ford Shelby GT500s for approximately $160,000&nbsp;each and spent approximately $163,000 renovating a 1969 Ford Mustang.”</p>
<p>O’Neill also spent&nbsp;hundreds of thousands of dollars on jewelry and a country club membership, according to the U.S. Attorney’s office.&nbsp;The vehicles, real estate, bank accounts, tractors and other assets were forfeited to the federal government as part of Ms. O'Neill's plea agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the embezzled funds, the court also was advised that O’Neill filed false income tax returns because she did not declare the stolen funds as a taxable income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in 2009, O'Neill would issue payroll checks drawn on the Marco account at Citizens Bank and deposit the checks directly into Bulldog's account at Key Bank, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>The total amount of that scheme was $2 million, with O’Neill manipulating Marshall-based Marco’s payroll system to conceal the fraud. O’Neill also&nbsp;made checks totaling to a sum of $215,000 payable to Bulldog from Rockerz Inc., another company controlled by Marco, and deposited those in the Key Bank account.</p>
<p>She also made checks totaling another $1 million payable to Bulldog from Marco and wired funds totaling $5.5 million from Marco to the Bulldog account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following her time in prison, O’Neill will be held on two years of supervised release, according to the U.S. Attorney’s office. U.S. District Judge Donetta W. Ambrose imposed the sentence.&nbsp;</p>
