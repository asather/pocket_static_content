<h1>Chartiers Valley girls basketball players and coach earn all-state honors</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The coronavirus kept the Chartiers Valley girls basketball team from repeating as PIAA Class 5A champions, but it didn’t stop one of its best players from earning a rare four-peat.</p>
<p>Senior point guard Megan McConnell became one of just a few WPIAL girls players over the years to be named all-state four times when the Pennsylvania Sports Writers All-State girls teams for Classes 6A and 5A were released Monday.</p>
<p>McConnell, a Duquesne recruit, was a first-team pick for the second year in a row. She was selected to the second team her freshman and sophomore years. McConnell averaged 14 points, 4.6 assists and 4 rebounds a game this season, and finished her career with 1,521 points. Chartiers Valley compiled a 95-16 record in her four seasons. McConnell’s brothers, T.J. and Matty, also earned first-team all-state honors their senior seasons.</p>
<p>The accolades didn’t stop there for WPIAL champion Chartiers Valley, which went 27-0 and has won a WPIAL-record 57 games in a row. McConnell’s teammate, sophomore guard Aislin Malcolm, was also named to the first team. Malcolm averaged 16.7 points and 4.1 rebounds a game and made 68 3-pointers this season. The Colts were the only Class 6A or 5A team to land two players on the first team. In addition, coach Tim McConnell captured Class 5A coach of the year honors for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>Two other WPIAL players earned first-team recognition Monday — North Allegheny’s Lizzy Groetsch in Class 6A and Gateway’s Lexi Jackson in Class 5A. Groetsch, a junior guard and Penn recruit, was the Post-Gazette’s player of the year after averaging 17.4 points, 7.7 rebounds and 4.1 assists a game. Jackson, a 6-foot-4 senior center who signed with Kent State, averaged 15.1 points per game. Jackson was a third-team choice her junior season.</p>
<p>North Allegheny’s Spencer Stefko was named Class 6A coach of the year after guiding the Tigers to a WPIAL title for the third time in four years. Stefko has compiled a 129-14 record in five seasons as Tigers coach. He also earned Post-Gazette coach of the year honors this season.</p>
<p>In all, 13 players from the WPIAL were named to Class 6A and 5A teams. All-state teams from the other four classes will be announced later this week.</p>
<p>Bethel Park senior Maddie Dziezgowski and junior teammate Olivia Westphal were second-team picks in Class 6A. Norwin senior Olivia Gribble and Mt. Lebanon sophomore Ashleigh Connor made the third team. Westphal and Gribble were both third-team picks last season. Connor was one of only two sophomores to make the Class 6A team.</p>
<p>In Class 5A, Uniontown senior Mya Murray, Plum junior Kennedie Montue and Woodland Hills junior Peyton Pinkney were second-team choices, while Trinity senior Riley DeRubbo and Moon sophomore Reilly Sunday were selected to the third team.</p>
<p>Central Bucks West senior Maddie Burke was named Class 6A player of the year and Archbishop Wood junior Kaitlyn Orihel was selected Class 5A player of the year.</p>
