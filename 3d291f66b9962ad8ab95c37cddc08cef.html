<h1>James Franklin's new contract details released</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The yearly rumors for James Franklin popped up again during the 2019 season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like every year, Penn State’s head man is linked to vacant or soon-to-be vacant positions around the country. This year, it was Florida State and USC. But Franklin and the Nittany Lions quashed those whispers in December, when Franklin agreed to a new six-year deal to keep him around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, after a couple months, the terms of the new contract, which were approved by the Compensation Committee of Penn State’s Board of Trustees, have been released.</p>
<p>Franklin will be guaranteed $5.4 million in 2020, which will be raised to $5.5 million in 2021 and then raised $250k each proceeding year through 2025, averaging out to $5.9 million a year in guaranteed annual compensation. He will also receive $1 million a year in the form of an “Annual Loan for Life Insurance,” according to the details</p>
<p>This is a raise of about $250k a year over Franklin’s last deal with the Nittany Lions, according to USA Today Sports’ contract database.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have James as the head of our football program. We wanted to make a strong pledge to James and this program with this new contract,” Athletic director Sandy Barbour said in a statement in December. “James came to Penn State with a very clear vision and we have seen that grow and prosper. What he has done to bring success to our program, both on and off the field, has been nothing short of spectacular.”</p>
<p>Included alongside Franklin’s guaranteed annual pay are his bonuses. These include a retention bonus, paying Franklin $300k in 2020 and $500k every year following if he is kept on as Penn State’s coach.</p>
<p>Additionally, Franklin’s performance bonuses include $800k for winning the national championship, $350k for winning a Big Ten championship, $100k for being named Big Ten Coach of the Year and $150k for National Coach of the Year, among other things.</p>
<p>The details released by the Nittany Lions also include Franklin’s buyout clause. In the event that Franklin would choose to leave Penn State to take another job, his buyout would be $5 million in 2020, decreasing by $1 million each year until 2025, when there is no buyout.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Franklin is terminated without cause, the head coach will be owed his guaranteed money for that year, plus the $1 million life insurance loan, multiplied by the remaining years on Franklin’s deal. So, for this year, Franklin would be owed $38.4 million.</p>
<p>One of the bigger parts of modern-day contracts for head coaches is their allotted spending for assistant coaches. It is a way of curbing outside interest of assistants and keeping some continuity on a coaching staff. This is especially pertinent with the Nittany Lions, who saw three assistants leave for other jobs this offseason. However, the assistant coaching salary allotment is not listed in Penn State’s release of Franklin’s contract details.</p>
<p>The delay in the release of Franklin’s contract details was a heavily-discussed topic in his media availabilities since December, but Franklin insisted it was simply a matter of going over the details and making sure everything was on the up-and-up before releasing those details.</p>
<p>“As you can imagine, these contracts aren’t like three pages of notes,” Franklin said during a news conference earlier this month. “So it’s about language, about making sure what Penn State is comfortable with, what we’re comfortable with, and that takes time.</p>
<p>“I think that’s going to happen soon, but I also know there’s some things kind of within Penn State and things like that that I don’t know what the process is, so I don’t want to sit here and say the time or the date. But it’s agreed upon, and it should be here very soon.”</p>
<p>No matter how it got done, though, it is now done. After putting together three 10-win seasons in the last four years and winning the Cotton Bowl, the Nittany Lions’ third New Year’s Six Bowl appearance in four seasons, Franklin has received a raise and is signed up to do so for the next six years.</p>
