<p>COOKEVILLE, Tenn. — President Donald Trump on Friday toured a neighborhood reduced to rubble by a tornado earlier this week and marveled at “the tremendous heart” he witnessed. He also offered a message for survivors and those who lost family members: “We love them. They’re special people,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump assumed the role of national consoler as he traveled to Tennessee. He surveyed devastated communities in Putnam County, where a tornado tore a 2-mile-long path, killing 18 people, including five children under 13. Many more people were injured, some critically.</p>
<p>Statewide, the death toll stood at 24 from a pair of storms.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump was met upon his arrival by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn and other top officials.</p>
<p>“It’s been a painful, tragic week for our state,” Mr. Lee said after surveying with Mr. Trump a street where eight people were killed.</p>
<p>The street was filled with debris where houses once stood. Limbs were crudely snapped from trees. A white laundry basket, chairs from a dining table, cinder blocks and a stepladder dotted the landscape.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump then met with survivors and volunteers at a local church filled with boxes of emergency supplies, pallets of water and tables filled with clothes.</p>
<p>“When you have those who lost somebody, that’s a very tough situation,” Mr. Trump said during the nearly 40-minute stop. “We are with you all the way.”</p>
<p>He posed for pictures and shook hands with people before speaking to emergency personnel. “Nobody’s seen what you had to go through,” Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p>Such trips have become familiar for the president, who has visited numerous scenes of disaster and tragedy after hurricanes, mass shootings and wildfires during the past three years.</p>
<p>The Republican president won the heavily GOP state by 26 percentage points in the 2016 election, and trounced Democrat Hillary Clinton in Putnam County by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Davidson County, the other Tennessee region devastated by tornadoes, is a Democratic enclave in the reliably Republican red state.</p>
