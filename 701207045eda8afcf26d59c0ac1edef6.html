<h1>Ron Cook: Maybe Tom Brady isn't going to go anywhere</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tom Brady made a big stir on social media Monday, but it wasn’t for the reason you are anticipating. He did not offer any insight into his choice of teams for the 2020 NFL season, allowing rampant speculation that he will leave New England as a free agent to play for San Francisco, the Los Angeles Chargers, Las Vegas or Tennessee to percolate for at least another day. What he did do was add to his ever-increasing Brady brand by announcing the launching of his new Hollywood production studio, “199 Productions,” which is so-called because he was the 199th player chosen in the 2000 NFL draft.</p>
<p>I’m sure you join me in wishing Brady well in his new endeavor.</p>
<p>All of us should be hoping the new studio brings new wealth to the combined $580 million net worth of Brady and his wife, Gisele Bundchen.</p>
<p>Of course, we are.</p>
<p>But there’s nothing sexy about a movie studio, nothing, at least, that can rival the attention Brady’s football future has received. It’s been so much fun I almost hate to see the speculation end.</p>
<p>One day, Brady is going to the 49ers. That theory has some legs because the team hasn’t committed fully to Jimmy Garoppolo, which it absolutely should do.</p>
<p>The next day, Brady is going to the Chargers. The team needs a quarterback to replace Philip Rivers.</p>
<p>The day after that, Brady is going to join the Raiders in their new Las Vegas home. He and Jon Gruden would be some match, although Antonio Brown isn’t likely to be part of a package deal with Brady.</p>
<p>The day after that, Brady is going to the Titans to play for coach Mike Vrabel, a former teammate with the Patriots. That makes the most sense of his non-New England options.</p>
<p>Brady appears to be loving the intrigue and has added to it every step of the way. There was the news last summer that he and Gisele are selling their New England home for, at last check, $33.9 million, reduced from $39.5 million. There was his cryptic tweet in January of a black-and-white photo of himself that had people thinking he might be retiring only for him to reveal it was a tease for his Super Bowl Sunday television commercial for Hulu, which ended with him saying, “I’m not going anywhere.” More recently, there was his courtside appearance at a North Carolina-Syracuse basketball game with Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman and “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon when he laughed off Edelman’s “He’s coming back” observation.</p>
<p>Brady loves to keep us guessing.</p>
<p>I have no idea what Brady will do, but I’m fairly certain that Brown won’t be coming with him, as more than a few normally rational people believe might happen. There is no way even though Brady has kept in touch with Brown since Brown played one game with the Patriots in September before being released after accusations of rape and sexual allegations were directed at him. Brady liked Brown and admired his work ethic. I get that. But I don’t think Brown will play again in the NFL. I don’t think the league wants him on one of its teams. It has refused to announce what surely will be a lengthy suspension for Brown for violation of the Players Conduct Code. No team will sign him until it knows what that suspension will be. Certainly, New England won’t be bringing him back after he took cheap shots at Patriots owner Robert Kraft after Kraft’s escapades at a South Florida massage parlor. That bridge was burned beyond repair.</p>
<p>A couple of news items in the past week or so has led to speculation that Brady — say it with me here, “the greatest quarterback of all time” — will leave the Patriots after 20 seasons. One had a telephone conversation between Brady and Bill Belichick going poorly. The other said that Kraft will not force Belichick to keep Brady the way he reportedly did before the Patriots traded Garoppolo to the 49ers in October 2017.</p>
<p>I’ve heard it said many times that Belichick and Brady are tired of their marriage, which has produced six Super Bowl championships. That theory has each man wanting to prove he can win without the other.</p>
<p>I’m not buying it.</p>
<p>Belichick and Brady share a love for winning more than anything else. Each knows his best chance is to do it with each other. The guess here is Brady will stay with the Patriots with a new long-term deal and turn his fascinating story into a major motion picture.</p>
<p>Talk about a blockbuster for 199 Productions.</p>
