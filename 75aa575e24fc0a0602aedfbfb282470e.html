<h1>Breaking down Pitt football's 2020 ACC schedule</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Good news, Panther fans: Pitt doesn't open its 2020 season against the ACC Coastal division favorites. But the conference slate is hardly kind to Pat Narduzzi's squad.</p>
<p>We knew for a while now whom the Panthers would play and where in the ACC. But on Wednesday morning, we crucially found out when as the conference (finally) announced where the scheduling chips fell.</p>
<p>Pitt, eyeing a second Coastal crown in three seasons, opens its 2020 conference slate on Sept. 26 against Duke at home. It hosts Virginia Tech on Nov. 6, Pitt's first non-Thanksgiving Friday game at Heinz Field — which Narduzzi probably isn't happy about. And his squad later welcomes Syracuse for the regular season finale on Nov. 28.</p>
<p>The Panthers' off week — there's only one this year, not two like 2019 — comes in between their game at Miami on Oct. 3 and their home tilt against Notre Dame on Oct. 17.</p>
<p>As far as trickiest tests, Pitt's three road games in four weeks as the season nears its end — at Florida State (Oct. 31), at North Carolina (Nov. 14) and at Virginia (Nov. 21) — stand out.</p>
<p>Accompanied by some early analysis, here is Pitt's 2020 schedule in full, including the non-conference opponents, dates and locations, all of which had been previously announced.</p>
<p><strong>All times are TBA.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Sept. 5 vs. Miami (Ohio)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> After facing Ohio — the 2019 Mid-American Conference favorites — in the non-conference last season, Pitt welcomes the defending MAC champion for its season opener. The Redhawks (8-6 in 2019) featured a respectable 40th-ranked pass defense. But Miami (Ohio) has never defeated a Power 5 program in eight tries under head coach Chuck Martin.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Sept. 12 at Marshall</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Similarly, Marshall has lost its last five games against Power 5 opponents, including a 43-27 defeat in 2016 at Heinz Field. This year's road game fulfills the second half of a home-and-home agreement announced in 2014. It will be the third time in Narduzzi's tenure that the Panthers play a true non-conference, non-Power 5 road game. Pitt defeated Akron, 24-7, in 2015 and fell to Central Florida, 45-14, in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Sept. 19 vs. Richmond</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> For the fourth time in five seasons, Pitt will play a Football Championship Subdivision squad from the Colonial Athletic Association. Pittsburgh native Danny Rocco, who now helms Delaware, coached Richmond from 2012-16, finishing ranked five times. Since then, the Spiders have gone downhill under head coach Russ Huesman (15-19 record in three seasons).</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Sept. 26 vs. Duke</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Picked to finish last in Athlon's early ACC predictions, the Blue Devils might be pretty bad in 2020. Duke, which lost five of its final six games last season, has to replace quarterback Quentin Harris and rectify a defense that allowed 143 points in four November contests. Pitt ought to be 4-0 entering its first true test ...</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Oct. 3 at Miami</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Graduate transfer quarterback D'Eriq King's 2020 Heisman Trophy odds (+1400), according to FanDuel, rank fourth behind only Ohio State's Justin Fields, Clemson's Trevor Lawrence and Oklahoma's Spencer Rattler. Miami loses key contributors to the NFL (RB DeeJay Dallas, LBs Shaq Quarterman and Michael Pinckney, CB Trajan Bandy), but King's dual-threat ability and new offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee could give Pitt's staunch defense everything it can handle.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Oct. 17 vs. Notre Dame</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Fortunately for Pitt, its lone off week comes before hosting Brian Kelly's Fighting Irish, who play Wisconsin at Lambeau Field and Stanford at home in the two weeks prior. Something to consider, too: This game is a “College GameDay” sleeper. If Pitt and Notre Dame navigate their first five games unscathed, both teams should be ranked. And there are only a few other noteworthy games in Week 7 (Washington at Utah, Iowa at Penn State, Texas A&amp;M at Auburn, Michigan at Minnesota).</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Oct. 24 vs. Georgia Tech</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This game certainly won't be featured on “College GameDay.”</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Oct. 31 at Florida State</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Pitt's first-ever game in the ACC was a home loss to the Seminoles in 2013. Jameis Winston, Jimbo Fisher and Florida State went on to win the national title that year, and the two programs haven't met since. Interestingly, Mike Norvell — Pitt's co-offensive coordinator in 2011 under Todd Graham — is Florida State's new head coach. It should be a total rebuild in the years to come, so tough to say how the Seminoles will fare in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Friday, Nov. 6 vs. Virginia Tech</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Instead of offering mine, here are Narduzzi's thoughts on the prospect of playing Friday night games at Heinz Field, per the Associated Press: "I don't ever want to pay on a Friday night in Pittsburgh because high school coaches would be like, 'Come on coach, what's going on?' But that would not be my decision. Unfortunately, ESPN and some of these conference offices dictate when we play. I think Friday nights are sacred, and they should be saved for high school football. Period."</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Nov. 14 at North Carolina</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This two-week stretch might determine the ACC Coastal. According to Athlon, the Hokies and Tar Heels are considered the early favorites for the division, and that's understandable. The former won six of their final eight regular season games, while the latter features ACC rookie of the year quarterback Sam Howell. If Pitt splits these two, Narduzzi's squad will be in good shape to get nine wins.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Nov. 21 at Virginia</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> The Cavaliers went on a history-defying run to the ACC Championship game in 2019. But don't expect Bronco Mendenhall's team to defend its Coastal crown. Dynamic quarterback Bryce Perkins is gone, as are leading wide receivers Joe Reed and Hasise Dubois. Still, back-to-back road games aren't fun for the Panthers.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, Nov. 28 vs. Syracuse</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Somehow, the Panthers will close the regular season with a home game for the fourth time in the last five seasons. Now, that doesn't mean Pitt is immune to laying an egg in those situations (see: Boston College, seven weeks ago). But if Narduzzi's squad is alive in the Coastal race in Week 13, facing the Orange at Heinz should help.</p>
