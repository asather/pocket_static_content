<h1>Pittsburgh's Favorite Champions voting: Pitt and Penn State</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Pittsburgh’s major pro sports franchises have won 16 championships since the early 1900s. Nearby colleges Pitt and Penn State have contributed a handful of national championships in football through the years, too. So which team is Post-Gazette readers’ favorite? We’ll find out in our Pittsburgh’s Favorite Champions series.</em></p>
<p><em>Today, we take a look at four Pitt and Penn State teams that were named consensus national champs. Vote for your favorite below, and the winner will go up against readers favorite Steelers, Penguins and Pirates teams in a new poll next week.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Pitt, 1937&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p>Pitt claims nine national championships in football, with eight of them coming between 1915 and 1937. Most of those claims are disputed by other schools. The consensus number during that time frame is closer to three, according to research from <a href="https://www.bannersociety.com/2019/1/10/20708453/consensus-national-champions-college-football" target="_blank">Banner Society</a>. The best of those was easily the ’37 team, led by legendary coach Jock Sutherland. It took down four ranked squads — No. 16 Wisconsin, No. 12 Notre Dame, No. 11 Nebraska and No. 18 Duke — in addition to rival Penn State, and its only blemish was a scoreless tie against Fordham at the Polo Grounds in New York. That was more than good enough to finish with 30 first-place votes in the final Associated Press poll. No other school registered more than two. Consensus in an era without it! Huzzah! Unfortunately for the Panthers, Sutherland’s illustrious career with the school ended one year later. He went on to coach the Steelers before his death in 1948.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Pitt, 1976&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p>Two words: Tony Dorsett. The year before the Aliquippa native arrived at Pitt in 1973, the Panthers were a putrid 1-10. By his senior year, they were national champions and had his greatness to thank. He gained 2,150 yards and scored 22 touchdowns on the ground in 1976. He added 415 yards and four touchdowns through the air to finish with one of the most dominant seasons by a back in college football history. And the team around him? It was pretty good, too. It took down three ranked teams in No. 11 Notre Dame, No. 16 Penn State and finally No. 5 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl to leave no doubt. At 12-0, Pitt got 59 of 62 first-place votes. And Dorsett? He ended his college career with the Heisman Trophy and most other awards you can think of.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Penn State, 1982&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p>Coach Joe Paterno’s first national championship squad is the only one on this list that lost a game. Still, Sports-Reference.com rates it as the best, by a hair, and it’s easy to see why after a quick review of the resume. The Nittany Lions made up for their 42-21 loss in Birmingham in early October with not one, not two, but three wins over top five teams -- No. 2 Nebraska, No. 5 Pitt and No. 1 Georgia. That last one came in the Sugar Bowl and included Lions tailback Curt Warner outrushing Herschel Walker, the Bulldogs’ Heisman-winning counterpart, 117-103 on 10 fewer carries and with two touchdowns to Walker’s one. Paterno and Co. were rewarded with 44 out of 55 first-place votes in the AP poll, with only Southern Methodist mounting any resistance at 11-0-1.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Penn State, 1986&nbsp; </strong></span></p>
<p>These Nittany Lions did not face much of a schedule for most of the way. They did take down Alabama, ranked No. 4 at the time, in late October, but the Crimson Tide and Boston College were Penn State’s only opponents all season that finished with more than six wins. It’s for that reason that they entered the 1987 Fiesta Bowl as massive underdogs to No. 1 Miami despite an 11-0 record. The Hurricanes were coached by soon-to-be Pro Football Hall of Fmaer Jimmy Johnson and featured Heisman winner Vinny Testaverde at quarterback with Hall of Famer Michael Irvin at wide receiver. They dominated a schedule with three ranked teams by an average winning margin of eight points. There was no reason for them not to be No. 1 until Penn State gave us all one, forcing Testaverde into five interceptions, the last in the waning moments to preserve a 14-10 victory. A total of 54 of 57 AP poll voters were left with no choice but to send the Lions back to Happy Valley with their second championship in five years.</p>
