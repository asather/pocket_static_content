<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 03.05.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: OK let’s get started with this week’s chats!!!</p>
<p><strong>Doug from Raleigh</strong>: Are you doing a Steelers mock draft, as seemingly is required of PG sports writers, and how do you think they will go with that 49th pick? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I will not be doing a mock draft. If I covered football I guess I would do one but I don’t have any desire to figure out who each team will pick in the 48 spots leading up to the Steelers pick!!</p>
<p><strong>Skinny Dug</strong>: Are the STeelers really THAT confident in their backup QBs (and Big Ben's health), or is it just an issue that there isn't money left to bring in a veteran backup, even a lower-priced one? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: A combination of both. They know they don’t really have the money to sign a backup they will legitimately be a starter. And they have invested a fairy high pick in Mason Rudolph and believe he can develop into a good QB. The major point of it all is they don’t think they can sign a veteran at the price they can afford to pay who will be better than Rudolph</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: I know I’m a dreamer but of DUQ could really keep it going, could it be invited to the Big East where all the other big Catholics schools reside? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well they would need to show a consistency they haven’t shown yet. I believe they have begun to show they are committed to winning and that is a key. The thing is this was an excellent Big East market before when pitt was in it and so maybe, and especially with a new building, Duquesne would be attractive if the BIg East was looking to be expand. The Dukes would bring a market the league doesn’t have right now</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Something I didn’t see mentioned in the debate on Pitt building a new stadium is that training and playing where the Steelers are often is mentioned as a recruiting advantage. What does Elijah say about that and if I may ask what is he doing? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think it is a little overrated as a recruiting tool because the two teams are for the most part separated. I liken it to chicken soup - you know when you have a cold people say “eat chicken soup” — well it probably doesn’t help with your cold but it can’t hurt, right? Elijah is doing very well putting his dual degree accounting/finance to good use as he works for a commercial finance company. He always thought it was cool to train at the same place the Steelers train but after a while the novelty wore off because of it you get so focused on your day to day stuff</p>
<p><strong>lturk</strong>: Which player(s) from Pitt's Basketball starting lineup will be subs next year? Or on another team possibly? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t like the question because it is asking me to speculate as to who is leaving and who is staying. I will say this team needs a true point guard and doesn’t have one so it is entirely possible that a guy like Xavier Johnson will see his role change completely next year.</p>
<p><strong>Blackhawk Bob</strong>: How many current players do you think will be leaving the Pitt basketball team over the off season <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Again, without getting into names. Pitt basketball is in the growing pains portion of rebuilding. They are losing a lot of games too. That means there will be some change in the off-season no doubt. I’m not sure who but some players will either leave or maybe asked to find a different home. And with the new transfer rules who knows what it will look like. My guess is that there will be maybe three or four players who move on from this team</p>
<p><strong>section 115</strong>: good day, you stated a while back the Pats (cheater nation) was the best of all time, then I read that they were as equal as the Strows for the hall of cheating shame ? What gives? free pass? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Nobody gets a free pass but I think the Patriots didn’t win because they cheated. They found an edge and exploited it and it definitely helped them but that’s not why they got to nine Super Bowls in 18 years or whatever it was</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Have you been to RMU’s new arena? Very nice. Maybe helping them have a great season. Can’t wait for Duquesne’s. Sorry for all the w’s. I am waiting in a long line for a Real ID card...p.i,t.a.!!! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Robert Morris built a beautiful new facility. I love it and it is perfect for that school. It is the right size and it gives them a chance to compete for recruits</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: As a journalist, when and where do you draw the line between objectivity/credibility and just being a "PR" voice for the team that you happen to cover? In other words, when does journalistic integrity trump keeping the teams and its players "happy" and lines of communication open? <br> <strong>Amanda</strong>: I called and spoke to you and Rich the other night and mentioned about how the bar was a bad look. You then joked about getting a Heineken. You should be ashamed of yourself, encouraging that sort of bad behavior. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Matt: You should never become a PR arm for the team. You should always be fair and objective. Now when you are a beat reporter there is a fine line to toe and you have to be a little careful but you should never be overly positive just to buddy up to the people you are covering. If you are fair they will respect you. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Amanda: What bad behavior are we promoting because the set of the Nightly Sports Call has a bar/man cave feel to it. You do understand Heineken sponsors the show right? It is their way of getting their brand publicity. We aren’t promoting anything evil</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville</strong>: Hi Paul...Question. You’ve been pretty outspoken about the extension for Ben being a mistake. Out of curiosity, what might Paul Zeise had done differently had you been in charge of the team? I’m not challenging you. I just don’t see that they had many other options, at least without hindsight. Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Simple - I would have signed a Teddy Bridgewater type for a much less amount for two or three years and worked on finding the long-term replacement. And that would have included finding out what you have in Mason Rudolph. If you did that - they wouldn’t be hamstrung with the cap, they could shore up other areas and the fact that they went 8-8 last year with horrendous quarterback play tells me if they had a guy like Bridgewater they would have won 10 or 11 games. Ben’s contract is way too much money for what he is at 38 years old</p>
<p><strong>Pitt fan</strong>: Should I be less optimistic about Capel and his ability to coach well and turn around this basketball program? Second year of an epic collapse, he seems defensive at the podium and rarely praises his team, always another guy from another squad. It's like he rubs it in at his own players. I am starting to worry this guy might not be the answer. 8 losses in a row? Are you kidding me? Thoughts. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: A fair question. And here is another fair question - if Stallings were still around would he have won 6 ACC games this year? But all of that being said, the progress isn’t what it looked like it might be but he is fine. I think he has recruited wel and that is the best thing a Pitt can hold onto as hope that it will improve</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Your colleague reported that his optimism for a relatively successful (500 record) Pirate season is based in large (?) part on the comparison between this year's clubhouse atmosphere versus last year's. That may be true, but I don't recall any of that negativity being reported last year regarding the players, coaches and manager? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It was clear that Hurdles message had grown stale with some players and they tuned him out. But sometimes that is chicken vs the egg - I mean most losing teams have a bad atmosphere. I don’t buy the “new energy” and all that as a reason the team will exceed expectations. A new voice, new training and coaching methods, a new philosophy will have some impact but in that league you need players</p>
<p><strong>Amanda</strong>: Guess you are gutless to answer my question. Coward! Coward! You and Rich should be ashamed of yourselves! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Maybe you have a hard time reading but I did answer your question. A beer company sponsors us. Now please, take <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: your mess as you are starting to slobber on yourself</p>
<p><strong>Questfor7</strong>: I really think the Steelers offense needs an injection of speed. Skill players that can take it to the house. Aside from DJ, the receivers had trouble getting separation. When Conner goes out, the Snell and Samuels seem slow and undynamic. I like WR Raegor with 2nd, RB Clyde Helaire in the 3rd and TE Albert O with first 4th. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I agree which is why I say that it is not accurate to believe that just getting Ben back will solve all of their issues. They need more playmakers on offense beyond the QB</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: What do you think is the biggest need for the steelers to succeed in 2020? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Online and tight end play needs to improve</p>
<p><strong>Jack Schuster</strong>: I’m saying PNC and the baseball tourists I meet Are enabling Nutting to keep milking the cash cow. Without them I doubt the bucs draw a million. What is your opinion. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: There is some degree of truth in that but Nutting is profitable with the Pirates for a lot of reasons way beyond attendance</p>
<p><strong>RPK</strong>: Pirates pitchers' ERAs are through the roof. I know it's still spring training, but wow! Is there hope? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes I wouldn’t worry too much about it. If they are still getting lit up when the games begin then I would.</p>
<p><strong>Skinny Dug</strong>: What is Amanda talking about?? Are you at a bar when you do your show? <br> <strong>RPK</strong>: Aren't there more deserving questions than Amanda's? <br> <strong>Amanda</strong>: Nice try Paul. Ireland contracting sponsors the show not Heineken beer. You laughed when Rich hung up and asked for a Heineken laughing. You missed my point of the call and today which is not surprising because you don't get it. The message is bad because a bar promotes drinking and young kids shouldn't see that. You should be suspended and take your sidekick Rich Walls with you. I'm done. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Sigh. Seek help. All of you.</p>
<p><strong>RPK</strong>: After watching the Flyers and Capitals bruising game last night, the lack of physical play will surely be their downfall. How can the Pens overcome this with their smallish players who refuse (are unable) to play a physical game. Yes, the Flyers, Capitals and Lightning have speed too. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They have beaten the Capitals in how many playoff series over the past? Every year we hear about how the Pens aren’t physical enough to handle these heavy teams and yet they have won two Stanley Cups in the last five seasons. They know how to play against those teams and as long as they don’t feed into the physical stuff they will be fine</p>
<p><strong>JeckylandHyde</strong>: Could the Steelers find a running back, someone like Carlos Hyde who would play for a reasonable salary and have proven they can be somewhat successful? Save the draft spaces for other needs? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes I think they can and won’t be shocked if they will. They need to make that position more stable and the end are guys on the market who will come at a reasonable price. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: OK that’s it for me thanks for all the great questions and let’s do it again next week</p>
