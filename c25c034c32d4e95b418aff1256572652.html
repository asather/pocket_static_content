<h1>Longtime mob associate Robert Iannelli and son plead guilty to sports-betting, numbers crimes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Robert Iannelli, a fixture in Western Pennsylvania illegal gambling for decades, pleaded guilty Wednesday in a Westmoreland County courtroom to charges related to running a sports-betting and numbers operation, the state attorney general's office said.</p>
<p>Iannelli, 90, identified by the former Pennsylvania Crime Commission as an associate of the largely-defunct LaRocca-Genovese crime family in Pittsburgh, pleaded to a count of overseeing a corrupt organization and running illegal lotteries. His son, Rodney Iannelli, 60, also pleaded to illegal lotteries, bookmaking and a conspiracy-related charge.</p>
<p>Westmoreland County Judge Meagan Bilik-DeFazio sentenced both men to a decade of probation and ordered them to jointly pay $75,000. They were both also ordered to forfeit $225,000 in gambling proceeds as part of a plea agreement.</p>
<p>The charges stem from an investigation into numbers-running and sports betting conducted by the Iannellis and the late Mark Diulus, the attorney general's office said.</p>
<p>The enterprise operated throughout Allegheny and Westmoreland counties and reached into Washington County.</p>
<p>Robert Iannelli, of Pittsburgh, has long been associated with the Pittsburgh mafia and has numerous gambling convictions dating back 50 years.</p>
