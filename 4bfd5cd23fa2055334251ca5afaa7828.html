<h1>Matt Murray's rough morning and six other observations from first Penguins scrimmage</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was a hockey morning in Cranberry.</p>
<p>Matt Murray may wish he had slept in.</p>
<p>The Penguins held their first official scrimmage of training camp Saturday at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex and streamed it online to hockey-starved fans. They played two 25-minute periods and redid the ice at halftime. Sporting stripes as the two refs were assistant coaches Mark Recchi and Ty Hennes.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan split his squad, which is still sans Patric Hornqvist and eight others potentially exposed to COVID-19, into two teams. The black team featured the Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin lines and the top defensive pair of Kris Letang and Brian Dumoulin. Murray was in net for the white team.</p>
<p>Things did not go well for Murray and the white team. They got smoked, 7-0.</p>
<p>Here’s seven observations from the scrimmage, starting with the guy in goal.</p>
<p>1. Alarm bells are surely sounding after Murray was beaten for seven goals in this scrimmage. And, yeah, not ideal for <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/07/07/penguins-camp-primer-matt-murray-tristan-jarry-goaltender-questions/stories/202007060012" target="_blank">the presumptive starter for Game 1 against the Montreal Canadiens</a>. But context is key here. Murray was going up against a stacked black squad and one of the two defensive pairs in front of him was Chad Ruhwedel and Kevin Czuczman, who barring injury will be in the press box to open the playoffs. None of the goals were atrocious. They were mostly odd-man rushes and shots from the slot. Heck, Murray actually looked sharp early on. He twice had to shuffle across his crease quickly to snuff out tough one-timers. But that sure is a lot of goals in a 50-minute window and Tristan Jarry continued to look sharp at the other end. Might this end up a true competition after all?</p>
<p>2. Geno is ready. The big Russian was the team’s MVP during the shortened regular season. He looks fresh and focused after the long layoff. It’s always fun to see Malkin in situations like Saturday when he gets to compete against his teammates. He seems to really relish it. He had a lot of life, whether he was skating through the neutral zone with swagger or barking at Recchi for not calling icing. Malkin got the first goal when new linemate Jason Zucker waited out Murray and set him up for an easy tap-in. It was one scrimmage, but that line, with Bryan Rust on the right, showed promise.</p>
<p>3. Because the white team had the extra forward, giving them seven, Sullivan was able to get a look at a few different line combinations throughout the scrimmage. That’s not a bad thing for a team with question marks in its bottom six. It is fair to wonder if <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/07/14/Pittsburgh-Penguins-third-line-Jared-McCann-Patrick-Marleau-Patric-Hornqvist/stories/202007140127" target="_blank">the third line will come together in time</a>. The trio of Patrick Marleau, Jared McCann and Hornqvist makes theoretical sense. But they still have to go out there on the ice and show it if and when Hornqvist returns. In the scrimmage, McCann’s lines spent a lot of time penned inside the defensive zone. Yeah, you may expect that considering the Hall of Fame opposition. But there are other really good centers in the East and coaches will try to exploit matchups if a certain line can’t hang. McCann will be one of the team’s biggest playoff X-factors.</p>
<p>4. I don’t know if Jake Guentzel is back to full strength. We won’t get a good idea about that until he skates against guys trying to check him into the seats. He said after the scrimmage that so far he has felt just fine physically. Either way, his hockey sense never went anywhere. His skating is back up to speed. And his wrist shot looks just fine. Guentzel snapped a pair of goals past Murray in the scrimmage and could have finished with four or five if not for strong saves by Murray.</p>
<p>5. The whole Crosby line took care of business. Connor Sheary set up Crosby with a slick pass from behind the net. Sheary was drifting toward the left post and slid the puck back the other way to Crosby, who whacked it by an unsuspecting Murray. NHLers make that pass look so easy but it’s a really difficult play.</p>
<p>6. Speaking of Crosby, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/07/18/Sidney-Crosby-leaves-Penguins-scrimmage-does-not-return/stories/202007180050" target="_blank">he headed to the locker room</a> with about 15 minutes left in the scrimmage and didn’t return. Sullivan, citing new NHL rules regarding injury information, declined comment on why his captain left the scrimmage. Sheary downplayed his departure, saying it was likely a “maintenance thing.” We’ll see if Crosby is back on the ice at Sunday’s practice.</p>
<p>7. When Crosby ducked out of the scrimmage, rookie Sam Lafferty was traded to the black team and skated between Guentzel and Sheary. He had been noticeable before then, like when he whipped a backhand off the post on a breakaway. But he really shined in Sid’s spot. He stole the puck from McCann then got an assist when he feathered a pass across to Guentzel on a 2-on-1. Moments later, he beat Murray for the final goal of the day. Lafferty, who in February looked like he would finish the season in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/07/17/Sam-Lafferty-Pittsburgh-Penguins-Mike-Sullivan-Patric-Hornqvist-NHL-playoffs/stories/202007170111" target="_blank">getting an opportunity to earn a playoff role</a> with Hornqvist held out.</p>
