<h1>Fentanyl ringleader from Wilkinsburg gets 15 years in federal prison</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A federal judge on Monday sentenced the leader of a fentanyl ring operating out of Wilkinsburg and North Versailles to prison for more than 15 years.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Marilyn Horan imposed a term of 181 months on Cameron Basking, 28.</p>
<p>A jury convicted him in the fall on multiple drug and weapons counts after week-long trial.</p>
<p>Trial testimony and evidence revealed Basking to be a large-scale drug dealer supplied with fentanyl from two sources. He used several addresses in Allegheny County to cut and mix the drug for resale.</p>
<p>An FBI task force that had used a confidential informant to make controlled buys from Basking and surveilled his operation executed a series of search warrants on those locations on March 14, 2018.</p>
<p>At 1415 Princeton Blvd. in Wilkinsburg, law officers recovered thousands of stamp bags used to package fentanyl in the basement in addition to ammunition. At 401 West Carter Dr. in North Versailles, they found 40 grams of fentanyl, stamp bags, blenders, grinders and gas masks as well as a loaded handgun, a Bushmaster assault rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammo.</p>
<p>At another location on Rebecca Street in Wilkinsburg, agents recovered another gun and ammo, more fentanyl, six digital scales and drug packaging material.</p>
<p>The government said at trial that Basking used the North Versailles house to store his drugs, the Princeton Boulevard house to cut and mix the fentanyl for distribution and the Rebecca Street house as his distribution center.</p>
