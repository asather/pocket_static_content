<h1>Sources: Blue Jays exploring possibility of playing games at PNC Park</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Yankees could be coming to PNC Park this season after all.</p>
<p>After Canada declined to allow the Blue Jays to play in Toronto this season, primarily because it would require repeated cross-border trips, multiple sources told the Post-Gazette on Sunday that they've looked into playing select home games at PNC Park in 2020.</p>
<p>It’s not known how many games would be played in Pittsburgh, although there are surprisingly few scheduling conflicts between the two.</p>
<p>Of the Blue Jays' 30 home games in 2020, the Pirates have a home game the same day just seven times. Six of those come Sept. 8 or later, too.</p>
<p>After learning that they would not be allowed to play their home games at Rogers Centre, the Blue Jays started looking at alternative sites such as Buffalo (where their Class AAA team plays) and Dunedin, Fla., their spring training home.</p>
<p>One obstacle with Buffalo is that there seems to be questions over the quality of lights and their ability to handle a major-league game, hence why PNC Park might make more sense.</p>
<p>Fans are not currently allowed to attend games at PNC Park, so it’s not like anyone could see the Blue Jays play the Yankees, Red Sox, Rays or Orioles — their AL East opponents.</p>
<p>In the National League, the Blue Jays will play the Braves, Nationals, Marlins, Mets and Phillies.</p>
<p>For anyone curious, PNC Park would welcome the Nationals once, the Phillies (3), Marlins (2), Rays (3), Red Sox (3), Orioles (7), Yankees (1) and Mets (3).</p>
<p>The move certainly makes sense from a front-office standpoint.</p>
<p>Pirates general manager Ben Cherington recently spent three years with the Blue Jays and is close with Toronto's president &amp; CEO, Mark Shapiro.</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton was there for one as quality-control coach, while assistant GM Steve Sanders also came from north of the border.</p>
