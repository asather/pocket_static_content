<h1>Cal U, Clarion and Edinboro form partnership aimed at improving education, efficiency </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two months after the State System of Higher Education&nbsp;authorized a financial review of integrations between schools, the agency on Monday announced a partnership between&nbsp;Clarion, California and Edinboro universities.</p>
<p>The State System said the plan is meant to&nbsp;expand high-quality educational opportunities for students by building on the universities’ institutional strengths, positioning them for growth and creating greater efficiencies.</p>
<p>“A partnership among California, Clarion and Edinboro has the potential to create a powerhouse,” Cal U President Geraldine Jones said in a statement.&nbsp;“Collectively, we would be among the largest providers of higher education in Western Pennsylvania. Through collaboration, we can serve our region even better, meeting the needs of all who will benefit from access to affordable, high quality education.”</p>
<p>The financial review authorized by the State System board in July initially examined&nbsp;potential integrations between three pairs of State System schools: California and Clarion, Edinboro and Slippery Rock, and Lock Haven and Mansfield.</p>
<p>The results of the review, however,&nbsp;showed that three-school affiliations could hold “greater promise” and honor&nbsp;the identity of each institution, the State System said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The State System said Edinboro was a welcome addition to the partnership it had envisioned between Cal U and Clarion, adding that the schools&nbsp;already share successful academic programs.</p>
<p>“This combination will be a good fit for all three universities, given their histories of serving students with diverse economic backgrounds and offering them transformative experiences that lead them to places they may never have imagined,” Edinboro President Guiyou Huang said in a statement.&nbsp;“We’re excited about the possibilities presented by this partnership and what we might achieve together.”</p>
<p>All three schools will maintain their individual identities and will continue to offer on-campus and online degree and certificate programs.</p>
<p>Clairon President Dale-Elizabeth Pehrsson said the integration would allow the universities to support their face-to-face residential programs and&nbsp;work collaboratively to create a unique online program.</p>
<p>“An integration that includes California, Clarion and Edinboro will provide great opportunities for our current and future students,” she said.</p>
