<p>Chief Jones also confirmed two adjacent houses were damaged by the blaze, which he estimated brought 60 firefighters to the scene.</p>
<p>There were no injuries, Chief Jones said, and everyone was able to evacuate the buildings safely. Each of the homes was occupied at the time of the fire.</p>
<p>Windy conditions and significant smoke complicated the efforts of first responders, according to Pittsburgh police spokesman Maurice Matthews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cause of the fire is currently under investigation, according to Chief Jones and Mr. Matthews.</p>
<p>Police were on the scene, interviewing residents of the houses, while the firefighters used a ladder truck to battle the flames from above.</p>
<p>McCandless Avenue was closed from Duncan Street to Stanton Avenue.</p>
<p>The owner of one of the involved houses declined to give comment.</p>
<p>Nearby resident Rem Dalverny was outside on his back porch when he heard what he described as a&nbsp;“pop” and screaming.</p>
<p>“[The pop] was pretty low,” Mr. Dalverny said. “You wouldn’t have heard it if you were in a house.</p>
<p>“I was checking on all of my neighbors just to make sure everything was OK. When we got [to the scene], it was only two of the houses, and that third house didn’t even catch yet.”</p>
<p>Mr. Dalverny said neighbors were writing down their phone numbers and offering food, water and blankets for the victims. The Salvation Army and the American Red Cross were also on the scene.</p>
<p>Another Lawrenceville resident, Kevin Johnson, 28, said he saw two of the houses — engulfed in flames — fall down.</p>
<p>“It’s heartbreaking,” Mr. Johnson said.&nbsp;“These were someone’s homes.”</p>
