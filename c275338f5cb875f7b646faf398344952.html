<h1>Driver for alleged burglary ring pleads guilty</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The driver for an alleged gang of thieves accused of trying to break into gun dealerships on the night of widespread protests over the shooting of George Floyd in May admitted in federal court in Pittsburgh on Tuesday to her role in the crimes.</p>
<p>Jasmine Greenlee waived indictment by grand jury and pleaded to charges related to helping four men, including three brothers, attempt to burglarize firearms dealers in Moon and Bethel Park.</p>
<p>Ms. Greenlee had been charged last month along with the others: Jerwahn Atkins, 23; Jerquay Atkins, 25; and Jamir Atkins, 21 —&nbsp;brothers from Spring Hill —&nbsp;and Haliston Este.</p>
<p>The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the group tried to burglarize Allegheny Arms in Bethel on May 30 and National Armory in Moon on May 31.</p>
<p>No guns or ammo was taken, but agents said the burglaries were related to other break-ins at commercial properties across the region.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Ms. Greenlee drove Mr. Este and another individual to a parking lot near Allegheny Arms on May 30 and also two of the Atkins brothers to the parking lot. They tried to break in using a crowbar but the alarm went off and they fled.</p>
<p>Ms. Greenlee later drove the group to National Armory, where agents said they tried to gain entry using a crowbar but were again thwarted while Ms. Greenlee waited in the car.</p>
<p>ATF said they believe the same group of burglars later hit the Verizon store in Mt. Lebanon, where officers saw a smashed window and discovered stolen merchandise, and another Verizon store in Green Tree shortly after.</p>
<p>After the second burglary, police saw a suspect jump out of a broken window and climb into a car.</p>
<p>Police gave chase but lost the vehicle.</p>
<p>On June 1, officers stopped a Chevy Malibu driven by Ms. Greenlee. She told agents and police that she and the three Atkins brothers and Mr. Este took part in numerous burglaries across Allegheny County, according to an affidavit.</p>
<p>She said Jamir Atkins had been the one who used a crowbar to gain access to the businesses.</p>
<p>At Allegheny Arms, she said, she remained in the car as the others tried to gain entry, but the alarm went off. Ms. Greenlee said one of the men then searched for gun stores on his phone and located National Armory, where she then drove them.</p>
<p>On July 21, police and the ATF interviewed Mr. Este, 27, of Glen Hazel, who also said he participated in several burglaries with the Atkins brothers, according to an affidavit. He said a crowbar was used to gain access to Allegheny Arms.</p>
