<h1>Local Scene: It's Ladies Night at the Honky Tonk Jukebox</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s no secret that the boys dominate the playlists of country radio, but the resistance is growing.</p>
<p>This month, there was a social media flurry after Variety’s Chris Willman tweeted his surprise at hearing Gabby Barrett (pride of Munhall) and Kelsea Ballerini back to back and was met with this response from a DJ at 98 KCQ Country in Michigan: “We cannot play two females back to back. Not even Lady Antebellum or Little Big Town against another female. I applaud their courage.”</p>
<p>Grammy winner Kacey Musgraves, part of the new wave of bright young country stars, chimed in, “And yet, they can play 18 dudes who sound exactly the same back to back. Makes total sense.”</p>
<p>Soon after, cable channel CMT announced that its programming would go 50-50 between guys and ladies.</p>
<p>With that as the backdrop, it’s a fine time for the Honky Tonk Jukebox, the monthly showcase presented by singer-songwriter Jon Bindley and 339 Honky-Tonk Band, to stage a Ladies Night. For the series’ 12th installment, they’ve rounded up some of Pittsburgh’s best in Molly Alphabet, Teal Fitzpatrick, Markila Sherman, Jenn Wertz, Addi Twigg, Rosanna Spindler, Sarah Siplak and Morgan Erina to cover the songs of female stars across generations.</p>
<p>Bindley says that having done the Jukebox for a year&nbsp;— it started on the North Side and is now at the Bloomfield Liedertafel&nbsp;— they are always looking to experiment.</p>
<p>“In talking to Molly and Teal, they were like, ‘We want to do a tribute to this new Highwomen record.’ I was like, ‘Why don’t we do that or let’s just make the whole thing a tribute to the women of country?’</p>
<p>“I’ve watched that Ken Burns documentary [‘Country Music’] a bunch of times now and seen how progressive and forward-thinking singers like Patsy Cline, Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn were. It’s cool because most people think country music and they think ‘red state, trucks, guns,’ but if you look back, country music is often ahead or setting the tone for human rights and progressive politics and open-mindedness, particularly with women.”</p>
<p>The Highwomen — a play on the ’80s country supergroup of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson — is a collective of Brandi Carlile, Natalie Hemby, Maren Morris and Amanda Shires that released its acclaimed debut single, “Redesigning Women,” last year.</p>
<p>“When the Highwomen album came out, I was immediately in love,” Fitzpatrick said in an email. “The album was written partially as a response to the unbalanced representation of male artists on country music radio, and it’s no secret that Pittsburgh is home to exceptionally talented female artists.”</p>
<p>They’ll play songs from that record, classics and some originals from Alphabet and Bindley.</p>
<p>“As much as we can squeeze into three hours,” Bindley says. “About 40 songs.”</p>
<p>Bindley, under the banner of Bindley Hardware Co., just released a new three-song EP called “Solitaire,” produced by Jake Hanner, that has him harking back to country ballad crooners like Roy Orbison and Chris Isaak.</p>
<p>“Most of the time it was me playing around in Jake’s studio with songs that didn’t fit the full band and run-and-gun style we’ve been doing,” Bindley says. “This was more like a produced subtle project. It’s kind of like a quick snapshot of a state of mind. It was why I wanted to release it in the winter, it’s sort of a chill groove, moody, blue winter record.”</p>
<p>It begins at 7:30 p.m. Friday, Jan. 31, at 410 S. Mathilda St. Admission is $10 in advance; $15 at the door; eventbrite.com.</p>
<p><strong>Deathwhite digs new ‘Grave’</strong></p>
<p>The majestic riffs of Deathwhite return on the Pittsburgh dark metal band’s second album, “Grave Image.”</p>
<p>Deathwhite formed here in 2012 from members of other metal bands with “the idea to play a slower and more spaced-out style of metal,” inspired by the likes of Katatonia and Anathema.</p>
<p>The other idea was to remain anonymous, which the hooded Deathwhite has steadfastly managed to do.</p>
<p>“Grave Image,” which follows 2018’s “For a Black Tomorrow,” was recorded at Cerebral Audio Productions with Shane Mayer and Mana Recording with Art Paiz and mastered by Swedish musician/producer Dan Swano, known for his work with Edge of Sanity, Nightingale and Witherscape.</p>

<p>“The sonic jump between our 2018 album ‘For a Black Tomorrow’ and ‘Grave Image’ is quite evident,” Deathwhite said in a statement, “and we are eager to share its contents in the near future. We are not too fond of cliches or typical band-speak, but the songs on ‘Grave Image’ are heavier than anything we’ve created before but also include a wealth of new elements, some surprising … some not.”</p>
<p>“Grave Image,” which comes with a gloomy video for “Funeral Ground,” will be released Friday.</p>
<p><strong>His name Said</strong></p>
<p>Toronto-born Pittsburgh-based rapper Farooq Al-Said releases his first album Friday with 1Hood Media, where he is the director of operations.</p>
<p>Said (his rap name) previously had a deal with Godsendant Music Group and Universal Music as Ayatollah Jaxx, and his album “This Is My Jihad: Harb &amp; Salaam” was nominated for CD of the Year at the 2009 Pittsburgh Hip Hop Awards.</p>
<p>Incarcerated as a teenager, he found a new path as a battle rapper and martial artist and, eventually, a school teacher.</p>
<p>On the album’s first single, “My Name Said,” he tells his backstory and relays his mission in forceful, boom-bap fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel B’s ‘Touch’</strong></p>
<p>“Touch Myself,” the new single from Rachel B, shares a theme of self-exploration but with a different groove than the old Divinyls hit, “I Touch Myself.”</p>
<p>Rachel B, who came to Pittsburgh from Traverse City, Mich., in 2014, does the touching in a smooth neosoul/R&amp;B setting with a clicktrack and slinky bass line.</p>
<p>It’s the first single from a new 10-track album, recorded in Barcelona, Spain, with Latin Grammy winner Frankie Biggz, she will be releasing one single at a time on the first Friday of each month.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9C9lhWlQns0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>For the “Touch Myself” video, she goes topless, covered by a floral arrangement. Forthcoming singles will feature collaborations with multimedia artists, from pole dancers to circus sideshow artists to avant-garde fashion designers.</p>
<p>It will be available for streaming on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>She’s Eighteen</strong></p>
<p>The bassist for power-pop band Chip &amp; The Charge Ups has arrived at the age that Alice Cooper made so cool, an occasion that will be celebrated Friday at Maleena’s Epic Eighteenth Birthday Blowout at Hambone’s, 4207 Butler St., Lawrenceville.</p>
<p>Maleena, the daughter of frontman Chip DiMonick, has taken on a bigger role in the Pittsburgh band over its past two years, doing about 30% of the vocals.</p>
<p>This all-ages show will also feature Erika June &amp; The Tunes and Utah of the Noble Hops, along with birthday cake.</p>
<p>It begins at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $8 at thechargeups.com/store.</p>
