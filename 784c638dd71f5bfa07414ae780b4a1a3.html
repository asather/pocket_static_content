<h1>With NCAA tournament berth at stake, Robert Morris feels ready for challenge</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Robert Morris players admit they are a little bit eager for the Northeast Conference tournament championship Tuesday night against Saint Francis.</p>
<p>For many of the players, this will be the first time they have been a part of game of this magnitude.</p>
<p>The Colonials (19-14), as a program, haven’t been to the NEC title game since 2015, when they beat St. Francis Brooklyn to earn a spot in the NCAA tournament.</p>
<p>So it’s natural, then, for Robert Morris to feel some nerves ahead of Tuesday. The Colonials do feel, though, that their preparation all season will allow them to be ready for the challenge ahead.</p>
<p>“We’ll talk about that. I think it’s something that you always have to be leery of,” coach Andy Toole said Monday. “You want to make sure guys are able and capable of playing the way they’ve played all year long and work the way they’ve worked all year long. I think when you churned every day and you work every day to prepare yourself for moments like this, hopefully you can rely on that training. You don’t have to do something new, different or incredibly spectacular. You have to do what you’ve done to get yourself here.”</p>
<p>For his part, junior guard Jon Williams says he welcomes the nerves for the occasion. In high school, at St. Vincent-St. Mary’s in at Akron, Ohio, Williams won the state championship in 2017.</p>
<p>Williams says his high school coach, Dru Joyce, used to tell him that the first five minutes of a big game will be all nerves. After that, it’s time to settle in and play basketball.</p>
<p>“That’s the type of games you want to be in,” Williams said. “That’s the type of games you live for, especially as a college athlete. You want to look forward to playing these types of games, and if you’re not ready for them, then hey, it’ll show.”</p>
<p>Readiness is especially important for Robert Morris (19-14) against the Red Flash (22-9). The teams’ two matchups this season were won by whichever team got out to a hot start.</p>
<p>In the first game, that was Saint Francis, which, behind a 30-point effort from conference player of the year Isaiah Blackmon, won by 15.</p>
<p>In the second matchup, the Colonials jumped out to a 24-16 lead less than 10 minutes into the game and at one point in the second half led by as many as 17.</p>
<p>With the stakes of this game — the conference’s automatic NCAA tournament berth is on the line — one would think it would be a closer affair. Robert Morris believes it will be ready for whatever kind of game breaks out at UPMC Events Center.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a challenge. I think we just need to go out and play the way we play,” Williams said. “We’ll be all right. Just stick to our fundamentals and what we do, and be confident and play free. I talk about that a lot, because if guys play free, we play our game and don’t think about losing and the season being over with. So we just need to play free and have fun and enjoy this moment. Stay in the moment.”</p>
<p>Added junior forward AJ Bramah: “It’s a huge game, and we’ve been preparing for this all season long, and been working. It’s going to be a bar fight, and we’re going to go out and battle.”</p>
