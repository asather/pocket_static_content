<h1>Paul Zeise: This Super Bowl lacks a major component — a villain</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The thing I’m fighting while getting ready to watch the Super Bowl on Sunday is something many others seem to be fighting too: apathy.</p>
<p>There just isn’t much buzz for this year’s game, even though the 49ers and Chiefs are both exciting teams and the game should be a lot of fun. There’s also the presence of Patrick Mahomes on one side and San Francisco’s dynamic running game on the other.</p>
<p>Still, that just hasn’t done it&nbsp; in terms of getting me psyched. And the reason it simple. This game doesn’t have an obvious villain in it.</p>
<p>There isn’t a player we really love to hate and root against. There isn’t a coach we love to see lose. Neither team makes our stomachs turn because it’s so obnoxious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last few years, the presence of the Patriots always made the Super Bowl an easy event to get hyped for.</p>
<p>It’s easy to root against Bill Belichick because he is a cheater whose teams have got caught cheating. That hoodie he wears makes him even easier to dislike.</p>
<p>There was also Tom Brady, another cheater who is the league’s golden boy and protected by the refs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was even Julian Edelman, a guy with a PED suspension and run-ins with the law who never seems to get mentioned among the list of bad guys in the NFL. Even owner Bob Kraft has had his share of controversy.</p>
<p>It’s so easy to find a reason to hate the Patriots and root passionately for them to lose in the Super Bowl. There is also that thing about how if they were to win another Super Bowl they’d have more than the Steelers.</p>
<p>It would be easy to drudge up hatred for the Cowboys, of course, but they never even win playoff games, much less get to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The Ravens no longer have Terrell Suggs, Ed Reed, Joe Flacco and Ray Lewis, but they still have John Harbaugh, and that’s more than enough to trigger people around here. They are also the Steelers’ biggest rival and a team that people in this area naturally love to hate.</p>
<p>The Chiefs, though, have a hard-luck coach who always seems to fail at the worst moment. He’s the kind of guy we root for because we just can’t take watching him blow it again. They have the All-American quarterback and a bunch of guys who seem to be innocuous. Yes, Tyreek Hill is a bad guy, but unlike Edelman, he is labeled as such.</p>
<p>And the 49ers? I bet if you walked down through Market Square and asked 100 people to name five players from the 49ers not named Jimmy Garoppolo and Richard Sherman — and name their head coach&nbsp;— 95 of them couldn’t do it. There has never been a more anonymous bunch to take the field on Super Sunday, and that makes it tough to find a reason to root against them.</p>
<p>That means this year, most of us will have to pick a team to root for as opposed to against. And finding someone to root for is just not as much fun. This game better be really exciting to keep our attention.</p>
<p>For the record, I’ll be rooting for the All-American kid quarterback and hard-luck coach to win, which means ... 49ers 31, Chiefs 27.</p>
