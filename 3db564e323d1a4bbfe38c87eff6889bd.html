<h1>55,000 artists apply for relief; 200 get $1 million so far</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As of Friday, more than 55,000 U.S. artists had applied for $5,000 grants from Artist Relief, a $10 million fund established to aid them during the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, a total of $1 million has been awarded to 200 artists. The grants will be awarded through September.&nbsp;Artists can apply at <a href="https://www.artistrelief.org/" target="_blank">www.artistrelief.org</a>.</p>
<p>In mid-March, a coalition of seven arts organizations that distribute grants organized the initiative, which started with a $5 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. An additional $5 million was donated by 25 charities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications are prioritized based on financial need, said Jennifer Benka, president and executive director of the Academy of American Poets, one of seven arts groups in the coalition.</p>
<p>Staff members from arts organizations in various disciplines are involved in the tiered review process “so that applications are considered thoughtfully,” Ms. Benka said. Staff from the National Book Foundation, for example, are reviewing applications from writers.</p>
<p>The Sundance Institute, famed for its annual film festival, is assisting filmmakers as well as artists in theater and fundraising.</p>
<p>Ms. Benka said applicants who did not receive grants should resubmit applications. “We will do everything we can to raise as much money as we can.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Practicing artists who live in all 50 states, territories or tribal nations and work in any artistic discipline are eligible to apply for the grants. Applicants must be 21 or older, able to receive taxable income in the United States regardless of their citizenship status and have lived and worked primarily in the U.S. during the last two years.</p>
<p>Tax-deductible donations may be made at <a href="https://www.artistrelief.org/" target="_blank">www.artistrelief.org</a> and 100 percent of donations will go directly to artists.</p>
<p>In a survey of 11,000 artists conducted by Americans for the Arts, more than 62 percent reported that they are fully unemployed due to the pandemic and estimated their annual income loss at $27,103.</p>
<p>The initiative to aid artists was organized by the Academy of American Poets, Artadia, Creative Capital, Foundation for Contemporary Arts, MAP Fund, National YoungArts Foundation and United States Artists. The Sundance Institute joined the coalition earlier this month.</p>
