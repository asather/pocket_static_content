<h1>Chelsa Wagner plea deal in Detroit means no felony, but case dismissal in dispute</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County Controller Chelsa Wagner pleaded no contest Thursday to one count of disturbing the peace related to last year’s recorded altercation involving her, her husband and Detroit police.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Ms. Wagner will not face a felony count of resisting and obstructing the police.</p>
<p>But Ms. Wagner and the Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor’s office disagreed Thursday about when the charge will be dismissed and what the plea entails.</p>
<p>Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the assistant prosecutor, said Ms. Wagner was sentenced to six months non-reporting probation and must pay $600 in court costs and $53 to Michigan’s Crime Victim’s Fund. Ms. Miller said the charge will be dismissed after the probation is completed.</p>
<p>But Ms. Wagner’s team said the felony charge will be dismissed “upon [Ms.] Wagner paying for court fees and costs,” which she did after the 9 a.m. pre-trial hearing before Judge Regina Thomas.</p>
<p>Ms. Wagner, in an interview, said the judge did not agree to the part of the settlement agreement that said her sentence would be delayed six months pursuant to non-reporting probation.</p>
<p>In response to Ms. Wagner, the prosecutor’s office put out another statement calling her claims “erroneous.”</p>
<p>“Please be advised that the case has not been dismissed by the court,” the office wrote. “Ms. Wagner has a six month period of non-reporting probation, where she must not have any new criminal cases and must pay court costs and fines. It is a plea under advisement and after six months the Judge can dismiss her case.”</p>
<p>The prosecutor’s office also provided a copy of the plea order in the case — signed by Ms. Wagner and her attorney, Charles Longstreet III and dated Feb. 13. The agreement includes six months non-reporting probation.</p>
<p>But Mr. Longstreet, in an interview Thursday, said that document was the original pre-hearing agreement between Ms. Wagner’s defense and the prosecution, and that he made a motion in court this morning to request a suspension of probation upon payment of fines and costs.</p>
<p>“The judge granted our motion,” Mr. Longstreet said.</p>
<p>Judge Thomas’s court is currently in session, and will not be available to comment until later this afternoon.</p>
