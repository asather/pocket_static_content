<h1>Federal judge rejects COVID-19 jail release request for asthmatic felon convicted in Cranberry shooting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kahlil Shelton, a felon described by a prosecutor as a "callous predator" and a "menace," wants to be released from jail because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>He says he has asthma, which he says puts him at greater risk in the Allegheny County Jail as he awaits sentencing for shooting a man in the chest <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/03/02/Kahlil-Shelton-shooting-Octavio-Marinello-shooting-drug-deal-2017-Cranberry-marijuana-robbery/stories/202003020087" target="_blank">during a Cranberry marijuana heist</a>.</p>
<p>But U.S. District Judge Arthur Schwab ruled Tuesday that asthma is not a good enough reason to release him.</p>
<p>The judge said the jail can treat his medical problem and cited a New York Times article indicating that people with asthma are not more likely to develop complications from the virus.</p>
<p>"While the Court is sympathetic to [Shelton's] medical concerns and claims regarding possible complications caused by the COVID-19 virus, such speculation concerning possible future conditions does not constitute an 'exceptional' reason for temporary release," the judge said.</p>
<p>He also sided with the government in that releasing Shelton would place a greater burden on the U.S. probation office to supervise him and that the victims of his crimes are afraid of him if he gets out, since he shot one of them and held a gun to the head of another.</p>
<p>Shelton, the judge noted, "joins many other criminal defendants in this court who have sought to be released on bond pending sentencing on the basis of COVID-19 on the basis of alleged 'exceptional circumstances.'"</p>
<p>Few are getting out.</p>
<p>Federal judges are typically ruling that jails are capable of treating medical ailments, and do all the time, and that releasing prisoners puts the public at risk.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, another judge ruled that David Francis, a purported drug counselor in McKees Rocks accused of dealing drugs that killed people, will not be released. He had argued that his age, 69, and various health issues make him eligible for release as he awaits trial. U.S. District Judge Joy Flowers Conti said they do not.</p>
<p>Shelton, of Duquesne, has admitted that he shot Octavio Marinello on Aug. 7, 2017, as he and two accomplices stole six pounds of marijuana from him in a Cranberry ripoff. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2018/10/01/Deron-Howell-Kahlil-Shelton-violent-robberies-Swissvale-Pittsburgh-sentence-federal-court/stories/201810010126" target="_blank">Deron Howell of Swissvale, is serving 42 years</a> for his role in that robbery and another in Lincoln-Lemington in which he held up four professional video gamers.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Shelton was the muscle for Howell in the Cranberry robbery. The two of them went on trial in 2018 and lost. Shelton won a new trial on a suppression motion, but instead of going to trial a second time elected to plead guilty.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said he, Howell and another man arrived at the home of Brandon Cavey in Cranberry to buy pot from Marinello. Shelton excused himself to go to the bathroom. He came out with a gun and pressed it to the heads of Marinello and Cavey. A 6-year-old was in the house at the time.</p>
<p>Howell stole the pot. Marinello resisted and Shelton shot him twice, according to his plea. Marinello survived.</p>
<p>Shelton is set to be sentenced in August.</p>
