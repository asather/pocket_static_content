<p>Education officials on Monday said that all Beaver County school districts and the career and technology center would remain closed through at least April 13.</p>
<p>The decision to remain closed amid the COVID-19 pandemic was made by the Beaver County superintendents, the CTC director and the executive director of the Beaver Valley Intermediate Unit.</p>
<p>In a letter to students and families, the county’s education officials said the shutdown could last longer, but they wanted to help families plan for the near future.</p>
<p>“It is our sincere hope that these disruptions will be temporary and that we will soon be able to get back to doing what we do best, upholding our districts’ educational mission for our students,” the letter said.&nbsp;“We appreciate your patience as we adapt to these unusual circumstances. Ensuring that we are a healthy community must remain our top priority until this threat has passed.”</p>
<p>The officials noted that they have opened meal programs for students and said that they are working to put educational opportunities in place while school remains out.</p>
<p>“Beaver County school leaders will continue to work together to help guide our educational communities through these challenging time,” the letter said.&nbsp;“We will continue to provide updates as information becomes available. We hope to answer questions about school calendars, commencement and other outstanding issues soon.”&nbsp;</p>
