<h1>Ron Cook: Pirates' season starts with glimmer of positivity despite loss</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Derek Shelton joined a pretty impressive group Friday night when he lost his first opening-day game as Pirates manager. Danny Murtaugh lost his first in 1958, Chuck Tanner his first in 1977 and Jim Leyland his first in 1986. Clint Hurdle probably would have lost his first in 2011 if not for a timely grand slam by Neil Walker on a cold, rainy day at Chicago’s Wrigley Field.</p>
<p>But Shelton hardly was a loser despite the Pirates’ 5-4 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals and too-early Cy Young contender Jack Flaherty.</p>
<p>It will be a successful season if Shelton’s players have his back the way he has theirs.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much good about the Pirates’ performance against the Cardinals, at least not for the first six innings. Joe Musgrove pitched fairly well, but he was no match for Flaherty, who picked right up where he left off last season when he was the best pitcher in baseball in the second half. The surprise of the game was that the Pirates managed to put four singles together off of Flaherty in the seventh inning to score their first two runs, both coming on Jacob Stallings’ two-out hit. That made it 3-2 and provided a little hope that Shelton might get his first win as a big-league manager.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>Richard Rodriguez entered the game in the eighth inning and gave up a two-run home run to Paul DeJong.</p>
<p>Have you seen that movie before or what?</p>
<p>The Pirates couldn’t dig out of the three-run hole, although they gave it a heck of a try. Jose Osuna drove in a couple of runs in the ninth with single before Cardinals closer Kwang-Hyun Kim shut things down by getting Guillermo Heredia to fly out and Stallings to hit into a double play.</p>
<p>Shelton has to wait at least one more day for that first win.</p>
<p>The loss stung all of the Pirates, but it didn’t take away from the best part of this warm July evening. It happened before the game when Shelton was right in the middle of a really nice moment.</p>
<p>It happened during the national anthem at empty Busch Stadium. New Pirates center fielder Jarrod Dyson elected to take a knee as a protest of social injustice in America. He was the only Pirates player to kneel.</p>
<p>Shelton, wearing a Negro League shirt when he did his Zoom call with the media after the game, said Dyson told him he was going to do it. As the anthem began, he quickly walked down the third-base line to stand behind Dyson.</p>
<p>“I wanted to show support for him so I went over and stood next to him,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>It was a simple gesture, but one that said plenty about Shelton. His players clearly took to him in spring training 1.0 and 2.0 because of his easy-going, supportive personality. They must adore him now.</p>
<p>Certainly Dyson does. That became clear when the anthem ended. Dyson stood up and shook hands with Shelton. The two then embraced.</p>
<p>Do you think Dyson would run through the center field wall for Shelton?</p>
<p>That’s why it would have been nice if Dyson would have had the chance to bat in the ninth inning. He was on deck when Stallings bounced into the double play.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m just an old romantic who loves a great story, but I believe Dyson would have won the game.</p>
