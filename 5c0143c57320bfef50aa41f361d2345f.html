<h1>Feds warn 7 companies — including televangelist Jim Bakker — about health claims</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Food and Drug Administration have sent letters warning seven companies — including a ministry operated by televangelist Jim Bakker — about making false claims related to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The letters, the first issued by the agencies alleging bogus claims related to coronavirus, were sent to Vital Silver, Quinessence Aromatherapy Ltd., N-ergetics, GuruNanda LLC, Vivify Holistic Clinic, Herbal Amy LLC and The Jim Bakker Show. The agencies said the companies advertise products — including teas, essential oils and colloidal silver — as able to treat or prevent coronavirus. There are no approved vaccines, drugs or other currently available products to treat or prevent the virus.</p>
<p>“There already is a high level of anxiety over the potential spread of coronavirus,” FTC chairman Joe Simons said. “What we don’t need in this situation are companies preying on consumers by promoting products with fraudulent prevention and treatment claims. These warning letters are just the first step. We’re prepared to take enforcement actions against companies that continue to market this type of scam.”</p>
<p>The letter sent to Bakker alleges he used his ministry to promote “Silver Solution,” as a treatment for COVID-19, the illness caused by coronavirus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such allegedly misleading statements included: "Silver Solution has been proven ... to kill every pathogen it has ever been tested on ... and it can kill any of these known viruses ..."</p>
<p>Also, "But this influenza that is now circling the globe, you're saying that Silver Solution would be effective? Well let's say it hasn't been tested on this strain of the coronavirus, but it's been tested on other strains of the coronavirus, and has been able to eliminate it within 12 hours, totally eliminate it, kills it, deactivates it."</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health says colloidal silver - tiny particles of the metal suspended in a liquid meant for drinking as a dietary supplement - has not been proved effective as a medicine and can be dangerous.</p>
<p>Bakker had already been sent a cease and desist order from New York Attorney General Letitia James office related to claims about Silver Solution made on his show.</p>
<p>Bakker’s website sells a variety of products, including seeds, books, and survivalist supplies such as meal kits.</p>
<p>The seven companies were asked to describe within 48 hours what they had done to correct the violations or be subjected to legal action such as seizures or injunctions, the statement said. A task force had already worked with retailers and online marketplaces “to remove more than three dozen listings of fraudulent COVID-19 products,” it added.</p>
<p>The Bakker show did not immediately respond to request for comment Monday but in an earlier statement said it believed in its product “because of the research and the advice from medical professionals that we respect.”</p>
<p>By Monday, the show's website still sold Silver Sol Liquid, but made no reference to the current coronavirus outbreak. After claims of strengthening the immune system, the site has the standard, "These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."</p>
<p>In 1989, Bakker was convicted on multiple counts of fraud related to a fundraising scandal involving his PTL ministries. He spent five years in prison.</p>
