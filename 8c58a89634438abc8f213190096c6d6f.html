<h1>Spring Run Road reopens in Crescent</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Spring Run Road less than a half mile east of&nbsp;Florence Drive in Crescent is reopened to traffic.</p>
<p>A landslide on Feb. 25 lead to closure of the eastbound lane and the entire road was closed May 11 so the county Department of Public Works could construct&nbsp;a rock embankment, improve drainage, rebuild the roadway and replace a guide rail.</p>
