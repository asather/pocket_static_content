<h1>As Labor Day weekend arrives, workers dealing with months off the job, struggles to get benefits</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nearly seven months and $25.5 billion later, thousands of Pennsylvanians are still relying on unemployment compensation amid the COVID-19 health crisis.</p>
<p>For every person, the experience is different: Some are still waiting to see benefits they first tried to claim in March, while others have been able to pay off credit card debt with extra federal funds tacked on to their unemployment checks. Some are waiting loyally for their former employer to call them back, while others are looking for new opportunities. Some are itching to get back to work. Others feel unsafe returning.</p>
<p>The people and the system both have been strained like never before.</p>
<p>“My professional life is just suspended right now,” said Michael Bott, a contractor from Bloomfield who works with data systems and struggled to get unemployment benefits for weeks. “I don’t know what I can afford and what I can’t until I get my money.”</p>
<p>“These are the benefits that we’ve paid for, in our whole working lives. These are the benefits that we’re entitled to and they’re not here,” said Cory Buck, a server at Vivo Kitchen in Sewickley who said the reopening and subsequent re-closing of restaurants because of pandemic-related changes messed up his unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>State and federal officials have scrambled to roll out a slew of programs to help people who lost their jobs due to COVID-19, including some that provided an extra $600 in benefits each week, extended the number of weeks an individual can collect benefits and expanded the group of workers deemed eligible.</p>
<p>But, with constantly changing guidelines and clogged phone lines at the state’s unemployment centers, many continue to struggle with a program meant to help them.</p>
<p><strong>‘You just can’t think too much about it’</strong></p>
<p>Officials from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry say the state has processed 97% of the claims it received for regular unemployment compensation between March 15 and July 25. That means either claimants received their payments or were deemed ineligible.</p>
<p>The other 3% — the ones that haven’t been processed — totals about 49,000 cases.</p>
<p>Mr. Buck, 35, from Highland Park, is among that group.</p>
<p>After receiving about three months of unemployment benefits — nearly $1,100 each week — he stopped filing when his workplace reopened as Allegheny County moved into the yellow phase of the state’s system.&nbsp;A month later, Vivo Kitchen shut down again.</p>
<p>Mr. Buck filed for unemployment compensation on July 2 and hasn’t heard a word since.</p>
<p>Though some restaurants have since reopened yet again for dine-in, capped at 25% capacity, Vivo Kitchen decided to keep offering takeout only.&nbsp;“It’s just not worth the hassle,” Mr. Buck said. “You could set up a system to be ready to serve and then the next day, the county, or the state, or the city —&nbsp;all it takes is one authority to say, ‘No, we’re going to do it this way now.’”</p>
<p>He is confident when the restaurant does reopen, it will be a good place to work. So he is waiting.&nbsp;<span class="comment"><br></span></p>
<p>So far, that wait has cost him more than eight weeks in benefits.</p>
<p>Though he said he brought in more money working as a server, the supplemental $600 in unemployment benefits that ended a few weeks ago helped him pay off his credit card debt. Now, he’s living on food stamps and locked in a battle to get rent relief from his landlord.</p>
<p>“If I made a full-time job out of pestering the unemployment office — those people aren’t having a good day either — I think I would lose my mind,” Mr. Buck said. “You just can’t think too much about it.”</p>
<p><strong>Playing the game to get money and help</strong></p>
<p>Jacob Paine, a writer and editor who lives in the South Hills, describes his experience with the unemployment system like a game show.</p>
<p>After hundreds of phone calls to the unemployment centers, the help of a generous legal office and a gentle nudge from his state representative, Mr. Paine, 36, said, “I feel like I got picked on The Price is Right to get customer service.”</p>
<p>Between March and July, workers at Pennsylvania’s unemployment centers fielded 290,000 phone calls and 645,000 emails, according to the state’s Department of Labor and Industry. Workers have put in thousands of hours of overtime and staffing levels have doubled, officials say.</p>
<p>“When you get the people [at the unemployment centers], they’re helpful, they’re human, they’re not showing their fatigue at all,” Mr. Paine said. “But they don’t even have the answers.”</p>
<p>In his case, an error in his application held up his claim for almost two months.</p>
<p>When he filed for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, he didn’t have all the information needed to answer some of the questions — like his quarterly earnings for 2019 — so he put all zeros.</p>
<p>Later, he was told that was the worst thing he could have done.</p>
<p>Mr. Paine credits the eventual fix with “three converging forces”: an employee from the state’s unemployment center who pushed his case through and secured a few weeks of payment; a legal services organization in Philadelphia; and state representative Dan Miller, a Democrat who represents parts of Mt. Lebanon, Castle Shannon, Baldwin and Brookline.</p>
<p>Periodically, Mr. Miller’s office will send a list of constituents having problems with unemployment benefits to the state’s Department of Labor and Industry and receive responses in bulk, helping to pass along that information more quickly.</p>
<p>But communication is still an issue, Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p>“Think of it this way: when you file to vote — if you want to vote by mail — you were able to go on to the county’s [website] and you were able to get a rundown of where your application is,” he said. “People are looking for that type of specificity as to where they are in the process.”</p>
<p>In some cases, that unemployment benefit process isn’t linear. After receiving a lump sum payment for the weeks he had been unemployed, Mr. Paine said the money stopped coming.</p>
<p>After another six weeks with no payments, he said the checks are now coming again.</p>
<p>He is starting to look for new work, without much success. The type of content he creates is “a luxury” for most brands.&nbsp;“What I hope is that whenever we really get back to a reopening, there’s going to be so many musical chairs that hopefully I’m able to find my place,” he said. “Whatever it may be.”</p>
<p><strong>‘It’s not a stimulus in our community’</strong></p>
<p>Aweys Mwaliya has been able to keep his job at Sam’s Club in Mt. Nebo Pointe&nbsp;through the COVID-19 pandemic, but, as the director of the Somali Bantu Community Association, he has seen many members of his community that aren’t as lucky.</p>
<p>All the usual problems and questions that the state’s unemployment systems bring are compounded by a language barrier. There are not enough translators, Mr. Mwaliya said. It’s not enough to just speak Somali, he said, they also need to speak the right dialect.</p>
<p>Normally, people could turn to family members or other community members for help, but that carries too much risk during a global health crisis.</p>
<p>Already, people within the community were struggling to pay bills, Mr. Mwaliya said. The language barrier limits participation in all sorts of services, like food stamps and Medicaid.</p>
<p>“It’s so challenging for people who have been living check-to-check, paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “It’s not a stimulus in our community. It doesn’t change anything.”</p>
<p>After struggling to navigate the unemployment system, Mr. Mwaliya said in September many people decided it would be easier to get a job. And, luckily, many found success with roles in the food and hospitality industry with companies like Allegheny General Hospital and Pennsylvania Women Work.</p>
<p>At his own job, Mr. Mwaliya said he feels safe — customers and employees wear masks and people follow social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>But the pandemic brought back difficult memories, particularly painful experiences of burying bodies during a civil war and drought before he came to the United States. In recent months, his community lost two members to COVID-19.</p>
<p>“I’m kind of reminding the people in our community of what happened to us in Somalia,” Mr. Mwaliya said. “If we really went through all those hardships with no government help, with no support or professional support, within our community in America, we will go through this.”</p>
<p><strong>Navigating state borders and unemployment programs</strong></p>
<p>For one worker, who asked only to be identified by her last name because of the personal details involved with the unemployment system, confusion over the system and lack of communication led her to apply in two states.</p>
<p>Ms. Yao, who worked as an assistant poker shift manager at Rivers Casino in Philadelphia, said she hasn’t been able to work since March, has had to apply for food stamps and stop paying her mother rent to live in her home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the casino furloughed most employees just three months after she started working there, the company gave staff members a month of pay. She wasn’t sure how to report that. And, as a resident of New Jersey but an employee of a Pennsylvania business, which state system should she file in?</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to be greedy to claim from both states but there’s just no one out there that could help me,” Ms. Yao said in July.&nbsp;“I just want to talk to one of the states, explain my situation and then have them let me know what I need to prove to you that I’m not working and not getting any income.”</p>
<p>By the end of August, she finally found some answers.</p>
<p>After connecting with Philadelphia Legal Assistance, a nonprofit that helps file claims, she heard back from Pennsylvania officials with questions about her application for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, a new system to offer benefits to people who were not previously eligible. About a week later, a check arrived.</p>
<p><strong>A 21st century solution</strong></p>
<p>After repeated attempts to reach someone at the unemployment center to determine what was holding up his benefits, Mr. Bott, the 35-year-old contractor who works with data systems, felt he had “been abandoned.”</p>
<p>As a last resort, he turned to a homemade solution he found in an unlikely place: the online chat board Reddit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A user had created a script that helped people get through the unemployment center’s live chat feature on its website. The script automatically retries the feature until an agent or a user starts chatting.</p>
<p>Susan Dickinson, director of the Office of Unemployment Compensation Benefits Policy for the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, said she was not aware of anything that helped users connect to the live chat. But, she said, a lot of individuals had said they could not get through because the queue is always full.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Mr. Bott, the script helped him connect with someone in just 10 minutes. His payments started up shortly after.</p>
<p>“This is the kind of American ingenuity that we love,” he said.</p>
<p>Before starting his job in database management, Mr. Bott had worked as a translator for South Side-based retailer American Eagle Outfitters’s communications department and taught language lessons on the side. Now, that side gig isn’t an option and he is starting to look for new jobs.</p>
<p>He had set up an interview with a new company he was excited about before the pandemic hit, but that opportunity is “on hold to who knows when.”</p>
<p><strong>Concerns that fell on deaf ears</strong></p>
<p>When Larisa Mednis, a worker at the Shadyside restaurant Soba, was first called back, she was looking forward to seeing her co-workers.</p>
<p>Just a few months later, Ms. Mednis, 22, from Bloomfield, resigned from her role.&nbsp;“They weren’t violating anything that the Allegheny County Health Department set up but a lot of concerns were like, maybe those guidelines are not strict enough.”</p>
<p>At first, she was working about one day a week handling takeout orders.&nbsp;There were very few people working at a time and the customers were barely inside, she said.&nbsp;In June, her hours ramped up.</p>
<p>The day before the dining room was set to open, the staff met to discuss sanitizing and cleaning procedures, but management didn’t address some of employees’ questions about healthcare, wages, scheduling and “what’s the reality of this going to be like?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Mednis handed in her two weeks notice in June. A few days later, she learned a co-worker had tested positive for COVID-19.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Big Burrito Restaurant Group, which operates Soba and several other restaurants in Pittsburgh, said the company has taken numerous steps to keep employees and customers safe. They understand employees have varying levels of concern related to the virus and they encourage workers to bring issues to management’s attention, said Bill Fuller, president of the organization.</p>
<p>“Our approach has been, at all times, to follow the government’s guidance and to update our practices as new directives have been issued,” Mr. Fuller wrote in an email. “We are rule followers. That is our company culture.”</p>
<p>Ms. Mednis now volunteers with the Restaurant Workers Mutual Aid where she helps others in the service industry in need of food, baby supplies and other necessities. She estimates they feed 50 to 70 households a week.</p>
<p>“I’ve always thought no matter what I’m doing in my life, I can always have an industry job,” she said. “I can have a serving job and be able to support myself off that. I’ll always be qualified and willing to do that work.</p>
<p>“Now, that has definitely shifted to I can’t really use this as a Plan B or a supplement. … Nobody is making any money in this industry right now, and it’s probably going to be like that for a while.”</p>
