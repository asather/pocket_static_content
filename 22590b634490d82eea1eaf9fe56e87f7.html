<h1>Tom Lester, actor best known for ‘Green Acres,’ dies at 81</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tom Lester, an actor best known for his work on the TV series “Green Acres,” died on Monday in Nashville at age 81. Complications from Parkinson’s disease were to blame, according to an obituary posted by his family. He was with his fiancee and caregiver Jackie Peters, the obituary says.</p>
<p>Lester played the character of Eb Dawson, a genial farmhand, on “Green Acres,” a beloved sitcom that ran on CBS for six seasons, 1965-1971. The series, which starred Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor, was a classic “fish out of water” tale, focusing on a couple of city slickers who buy a dilapidated farm in the country.</p>
<p>Lester’s role was among many providing comic relief, as Albert’s character, the straitlaced Oliver Wendell Douglas, attempted to adjust to life in the wacky town of Hooterville. The town was filled with colorful residents, including Mr. Haney, a rural con man played by Alabama native Pat Buttram.</p>
<p>A running gag gave human attributes to a pig named Arnold, who could play the piano, sign checks, attend school, change the TV channel and communicate with the residents of Hooterville in grunts and squeals. Everyone but a baffled Oliver Douglas could understand and converse with Arnold, including Lester’s character.</p>
<p>“Green Acres” was inspired by the success of “The Beverly Hillbillies" and “Petticoat Junction," two rural-themed sitcoms that also ran on CBS in the ’60s and early ’70s. Lester, as Eb Dawson, made guest appearances on both of those sister shows.</p>
<p>The actor appeared in nearly every episode of “Green Acres” and reprised his character in a 1990 TV movie, “Return to Green Acres.” His resume also includes roles on TV shows such as “Love, American Style,” “Little House on the Prairie,” “Knight Rider” and “Marcus Welby, M.D.," and movies such as "Gordy” and “Benji.”</p>
<p>Lester was born Sept. 23, 1938, in Laurel, Mississippi. He owned a farm in the state’s Jasper County, according to his obituary, and was a born-again Christian and conservationist. A graveside service for family and friends is set for Friday at Hickory Grove Cemetery in Laurel, the obituary says.</p>
