<h1>Pa.'s black legislative caucus demands investigation of Allegheny County judge, alleged racist comments</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus has joined others in urging that the state’s Judicial Conduct Review Board investigate racist comments allegedly made by Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Mark Tranquilli, calling the allegations indicative of a “broken criminal justice system.”</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli is accused of referring to a black female juror as "Aunt Jemima" repeatedly in comments in chambers following the acquittal of a drug suspect in January, according to a written complaint. The remarks were allegedly made&nbsp;during a closed-door meeting.</p>
<p>He has since been restricted from hearing cases and has been temporarily reassigned to “administration duties only,” according to a court order signed last week by President Judge Kimberly Berkeley Clark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Here’s a copy of President Judge Kim Berkeley Clark’s latest court order that forbids Judge Mark Tranquilli from hearing cases:</em></strong></p>
<p>The PLBC on Wednesday condemned the alleged remarks, saying they are “another manifestation of a broken criminal justice system that systemically targets black and brown people.”</p>
<p>State Rep. Ed Gainey, D-Lincoln-Lemington, was among those who spoke out, saying the controversy goes beyond just one judge’s statements.</p>
<p>“Our society is based on the belief that justice is blind — that regardless of race, color or creed, every man and woman will be treated and judged the same. And so, when we hear allegations like this, it doesn’t just reflect poorly on one judge, or one courtroom, but on the entire justice system,” Mr. Gainey said in a statement.</p>
<p>“This is a great example as to why black and brown people have fear and reservations about our criminal justice system. How can people of color believe they will get a fair chance in court when we hear about an incident like this? How can we be asked to trust a system in which these remarks exhibit an explicit bias? If justice is not blind, then it cannot be fair, and it is no justice at all.”</p>
<p>PLBC Chairman Rep. Stephen Kinsey, D-Philadelphia questioned whether Judge Tranquilli’s actions as a judge and former prosecutor were motivated by race.</p>
<p>“It’s deeply disturbing hearing such comments from a sitting common pleas judge and a former prosecutor charged with using morality as a compass in finding truth and seeking justice, but this incident is not an isolated one,” he said.&nbsp;“This chants back to a deep-rooted and pervasive problem in our criminal justice system, not only in our commonwealth, but across our nation, a system that disproportionately targets black and brown bodies. I also beg to question whether his convictions throughout his tenure were motivated by racial biases. We are demanding this investigation to eradicate this systemic racism from an institution that is supposed to be unbiased and blind.”</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Bar Association and the Black Political Empowerment Project in Pittsburgh spoke out last week about the allegations. On Wednesday, the Philadelphia Bar Association also issued a statement urging for the Judicial Conduct Review Board to investigate the allegations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here’s the full letter from B-PEP to President Judge Kim Berkeley Clark:</strong></em></p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli allegedly made comments in his chambers in the presence of the prosecutor, Ted Dutkowski, and the defense attorney, Joe Otte.</p>
<p>A written complaint by Mr. Otte to the state Judicial Conduct Board, obtained by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, details the conversation with the judge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statement indicates that Judge Tranquilli was upset that the suspect was found not guilty and criticized Mr. Dutkowski for not adequately screening the jurors.</p>
<p>"The judge then said that Ted had made a terrible decision by allowing 'Aunt Jemima' on the jury," the complaint reads. "The juror, Juror #4, was a young black woman who had worn a hair wrap throughout the trial. The judge expressed that he knew Ted was not going to get a conviction from the moment Juror #4 was questioned."</p>
<p>The complaint also says that the judge indicated he knows that the woman's "baby daddy" probably sells heroin and that her "presumed bias in favor of heroin dealers had caused or contributed to the not guilty verdict."</p>
<p>The defendant had been previously convicted of simple possession and was being retried on a count of possession with intent to deliver following a hung jury. After a day of jury selection and two days of trial, the jury found the defendant not guilty.</p>
<p>"Following the verdict, Judge Tranquilli was visibly upset," Mr. Otte's complaint said. "When he received the verdict slip, he read it and immediately tossed it back at his minute clerk."</p>
<p>When the judge called the defendant forward for sentencing on the simple possession conviction, he "proceeded to make several comments about my client's criminal history in the presence of the jury," including mentioning a federal drug sentence the man is serving.</p>
<p>"The judge made several additional comments to the effect that he believed my client was a drug dealer rather than a drug user," the complaint states.</p>
<p>Mr. Otte has declined to comment.</p>
<p>After the jury was dismissed, the judge called the two lawyers into his chambers and then "immediately expressed his dissatisfaction with the jury." It was in that context that he made the racially charged comment about Juror #4, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>A formal record of the conversation is not available because no court reporter attended the meeting in chambers.</p>
<p>In addition to the PLBC, the Philadelphia Bar Association on Wednesday also asked for an investigation.</p>
<p>In a statement by its chancellor and retired Judge A. Michael Snyder, it said it cannot, and will not, tolerate comments by a jurist which reflect racial bias or disparagement. The allegation of any such comments by a judge demands a full investigation.</p>
<p>“Such comments, if made, reflect an intolerance and lack of respect for all involved in the judicial process. The fair administration of justice demands that everyone, of any race, ethnicity or gender be treated with dignity and respect.”</p>
<p>The Judicial Conduct Review Board is a 12-member board that investigates allegations of ethics violations made against judges. Half of its members are appointed by Gov. Tom Wolf. The other half are appointed by the state Supreme Court.</p>
