<h1>Three emergency food bank distributions scheduled this week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank is holding three emergency drive-up distributions this week:</p>
<p>• In conjunction with Alliance for Nonprofit Resources, Friends of the Bantam Jeep Association and the Butler County Sheriff’s Office, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Tuesday at the Big Butler Fairgrounds, 1127 New Castle Road, in Prospect, Butler County.</p>
<p>• In conjunction with Pittsburgh International Airport, from noon to 2 p.m. Wednesday at the airport, 1000 Airport Blvd., Findlay.</p>
<p>• In conjunction with the Pittsburgh Penguins and the City of Pittsburgh, from 10 a.m. to noon Friday at 1418 Centre Ave., near Pittsburgh Paints Arena.</p>
<p>The food bank will serve up to 1,000 vehicles at all three drive-up distributions.</p>
<p>The nonprofit said each vehicle will receive one food share (at least 50 pounds of food) per vehicle. Due to the high demand for assistance and to ensure as many people receive food as possible, the organization said it must adhere to this policy.</p>
<p>To make the process run smoothly, the food bank asks that people stay in their vehicles and unlock their trunk or backseat door so volunteers can place the food into their car. No walk-ups will be permitted due to safety concerns.</p>
<p>Those needing more food help should contact their local food pantry or visit the food bank’s website for help in locating a pantry near where you live, according to the nonprofit. The website includes a map of food pantries, meals for children and SNAP (food stamps) application assistance.
