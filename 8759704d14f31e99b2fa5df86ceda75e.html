<h1>COVID-19 stings St. Clair Hospital’s Q3 financials, but revenue rises</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Stung by the shutdown of non-emergency medical care, St. Clair Hospital in Mt. Lebanon on Thursday reported a drop of nearly 15% in operating income for the nine months ending March 31, proof that not even the most fiscally healthy medical institutions are immune to fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>St. Clair, which stopped doing non-emergency medical procedures in early March to comply with state health department directives, reported operating income of $22.4 million for the nine months ending March 31 —&nbsp;14.7% or $3.8 million less than the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>The hospital’s operating margin for the period was an enviable 9.3%, but still lower than the prior year’s margin of 11.3%.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The statewide average hospital operating margin was 5.63% in 2019, according to the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council. That compared to 4.51% for southwestern Pennsylvania institutions, with many smaller health systems operating in the red.</p>
<p>St. Clair has historically been among the fiscally fittest hospitals in the Pittsburgh region with regular double-digit returns from delivering core medical services.</p>
<p>In addition to a 329-bed hospital, St. Clair operates outpatient centers in Bethel Park and Peters. Construction is underway on a third, 280,000-square-foot comprehensive outpatient center on the hospital campus —&nbsp;the biggest expansion at St. Clair in four decades.</p>
<p>The outpatient center —&nbsp;which is being paid for with government grants, bond proceeds and other funds —&nbsp;is expected to open in 2021.</p>
<p>Despite the March slowdown due to efforts to contain the highly contagious respiratory coronavirus, St. Clair reported a 4.3% gain in net patient service revenue —&nbsp;$234 million compared to $224.3 million the previous year —&nbsp;and a 3.8% increase in operating revenue —&nbsp;$242 million compared to $233 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Excess revenue over expenses fell 75.3% to $8.2 million from $25.1 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Investment losses, driven by sharp market declines in March, totaled $14.1 million, which compared to the prior year’s gain of $7.1 million.</p>
<p>St. Clair is the latest independent community hospital to report losses from preparing for the COVID-19 outbreak and the suspension of non-emergency medical care, which include high-margin procedures.</p>
<p>Excela Health in Westmoreland County, Heritage Valley Health System in Beaver County and Washington Health System in Washington County also reported COVID-19-related losses in recent financial results.</p>
