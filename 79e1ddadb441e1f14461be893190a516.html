<h1>Obituary: Robert Kehoe | Honored with prestigious award for valor in World War II </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Robert Kehoe was 9 when his mother died of tuberculosis. During the Depression in central New Jersey, he helped his father pay her medical bills by working in strawberry fields for 15 cents an hour.</p>
<p>He grew into a pensive youth whose interest in linguistics earned him the unusual yearbook distinction of being named most likely to become a lexicographer.</p>
<p>He was hapless, even hopeless, in sports and a flop as a lab assistant in a chemical plant and as a Remington typewriter salesman. He took science classes at Rutgers University in the vague hope of qualifying for medical school, but his grades plummeted and he dropped out at 19, shortly before the United States entered World War II.</p>
<p>The Army Air Corps, he recalled in an oral history, “was a big attraction, largely because most of us had barely seen an airplane before.” But he was too nearsighted to pilot a plane and wound up as an Army Signal Corps radio operator.</p>
<p>One day, he said, over the mess hall loudspeaker came a call for volunteers for an assignment that was overseas and hazardous: training for unconventional warfare with the Office of Strategic Services, the CIA’s wartime precursor.</p>
<p>Mr. Kehoe fulfilled the necessary requirements, including a willingness to jump from airplanes into enemy-held territory. “When you’re 19, 20,” he told an interviewer last year, “this sounded, and it was, very exciting.”</p>
<p>He received an OSS assignment as the wireless-radio operator for a three-man operational group that parachuted into Brittany, a peninsular region in northwestern France, on June 9, 1944, three days after the D-Day invasion just to the east in Normandy.</p>
<p>Mr. Kehoe’s team and dozens of others were tasked with arranging airdrops of supplies and weapons for the Allied commandos and French resistance fighters seeking to divert the Germans from the Normandy coastline.</p>
<p>Mr. Kehoe, who died Aug. 28 at 98, received the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army’s second-highest award for valor, for helping organize, arm and direct the anti-German paramilitary resistance.</p>
<p>Mr. Kehoe, who at the time held the rank of sergeant, was the youngest and least battle-tested member of his trio, which included a 26-year-old British major who had fought in raids along the Norwegian coast and a 32-year-old French lieutenant who had dodged bullets in France and North Africa.</p>
<p>Their initial parachute landing in rural Brittany went smoothly. Local farmers and members of the resistance met them with embraces and strong cider. But the Germans noticed their bonfires and, on June 11, sent soldiers to scout the area.</p>
<p>The French guerrilla teams, newly fortified with weapons and composed of young and eager fighters, grew “trigger-happy,” Mr. Kehoe said. When unsuspecting German soldiers stopped by a house simply to ask for directions, the French fighters turned the encounter into a bloodbath.</p>
<p>The commotion of gunfire and grenades sent hundreds of German reinforcements pouring into the area. Mr. Kehoe and his team settled into a cow pasture near the village of Peumerit-Quintin, miles from the nearest paved road, hiding in a ditch with a blanket for cover from the rain. Without formal shelter or even a tent, they avoided being spotted by German air reconnaissance.</p>
<p>“I remember only one occasion during this three-week period when, completely soaked, we broke down and retreated to the old farmhouse sheltering the wounded men,” he wrote in a remembrance. “After drying out and eating a warm meal, we spent a luxurious night in the adjacent barn, warmed by a year’s supply of hay and fermenting manure — a perfect cure for the cold I was developing.”</p>
<p>At one point, Mr. Kehoe and his team moved into an abandoned building closer to a major crossroads to monitor German troop strength and supplies headed to Normandy. From there, he established a network of lookouts and transmitted valuable information back to operations planners in London.</p>
<p>Robert Richard Kehoe, the son of Irish immigrants, was born in New Brunswick, N.J., on May 23, 1922. His father was an executive with Johnson &amp; Johnson. The youngest of six, he was raised primarily by his siblings.</p>
<p>He worked at the CIA from 1949 to 1984, mainly training intelligence officials in subjects including Chinese Communist ideology, according to his family.</p>
<p>Mr. Kehoe was married to Ann Heckman from 1954 until her death in 2010. In addition to his son Michael of Bozeman, Mont., survivors include two other children, John Kehoe of Centennial, Colo., and Marion Down of Boulder; and four grandchildren.</p>
