<p><strong>HIGH POINT, N.C.</strong> —&nbsp;Everything that debuts at the furniture markets in High Point isn’t awesome, but there are plenty of truly stunning pieces that deserve a moment. &nbsp;Here are a few large and small statement pieces that caught our attention at the Fall Market. Look for them in local showrooms this spring.</p>
<p>Matthew Frederick found that interior designers didn’t want to buy furnishings with another designer’s name on it. “So I came up with a name I felt reflected the brand and had a certain elegance and timelessness to it and Browne &amp; Moore was born.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Browne &amp; Moore Collection manufactured by <a href="https://www.ejvictor.com/" target="_blank">EJ Victor</a> debuted at the Fall Market in October. One piece that drew lots of attention from buyers was the Double Abbey secretary.&nbsp; “It has its DNA in Biedermeier design from the pediment to the feet to the overall silhouette,” said the designer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Frederick made the mid-1800s look relevant with a Shaker detail on the doors, custom hardware and outlets inside for computers and TVs. It could even be used as a bar, and it is made of maple with many paint and stain options.</p>
<p>“I think the painted finish gives it a lot of options for customization,” he said.</p>
<p>The signature piece was shown in a light gray with a bright Hermes orange interior.&nbsp;EJ Victor is available locally at<a href="https://www.weisshouse.com/" target="_blank"> Weisshouse Furniture</a>.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of her famous father, Mark, Alexa Hampton displayed her 120-piece collection for<a href="https://www.theodorealexander.com/" target="_blank"> Theodore Alexander.</a> Her love of the dramatic was evident in the deep red walls at the entrance to her showroom, where she gave visitors mini tutorials on her style.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I love good metal detail. I wanted the collection to be incredibly eclectic so you will see things that are Regency inspired to Mughal Indian architecture and a French-inspired bed,” said Ms. Hampton.</p>
<p>She believes people love to be surrounded by a wide array of styles. “None of us lives in a museum, especially not Americans. That is the benefit of American design. It is a mix of what we love.”</p>
<p><a href="https://highlandhousefurniture.com/" target="_blank">Highland House</a> showed off its new Catbird chair fully upholstered in a digitally printed fabric; it’s available in a variety of fabrics.</p>
<p>“We just took a small document and printed it,” explained creative director Lee Belmore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Highland House Furniture and Theodore Alexander furniture can be purchased through the<a href="http://www.antiquarianshop.com/" target="_blank"> Antiquarian Shop</a> in Sewickley.</p>
<p><a href="https://fourhands.com/" target="_blank"> Four Hands</a> introduced the Tracey Boyd Collection with the Trefoil sideboard, featuring an engineered oak veneer marquetry with a cross-hatch pattern.</p>
<p>“I find inspiration from the environment around me,” said Ms. Boyd. “If something stands out, I'll focus on that and draw ideas around it.</p>
<p>“I turned to my love of nature with lots of inspiration coming from a beautiful clover field at my country cottage. Examining the different shapes, colors and textures, the piece really came together to showcase the unique and natural patterns around us."</p>
<p>For Century Furniture, Thomas O’Brien added a few new pieces to his established collection, including the popular Compass side table.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Thomas O’Brien’s Compass table is a fantastic conversation piece to add to any room,” said Jeff Lenchner, president of Today’s Home.</p>
<p>Four Hands and Century collections are available locally at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.todayshomeinc.com/" target="_blank">Today’s Home</a>&nbsp;and other stores.</p>
<p>Another smaller more adaptable item came from <a href="https://www.rscollection.com/#/home" target="_blank">Roberta Schilling</a>.&nbsp; The upholstered&nbsp; Moove stool with a walnut base and handle can be easily transported to where it is needed for seating or to hold a tray.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
