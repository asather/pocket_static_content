<h1>Police ask for public's help in investigation into shooting of 1-year-old</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police on Tuesday asked the public to submit any information they have that could help the investigation into the fatal shooting of a 1-year-old boy in Spring Hill.</p>
<p>The child, Zykier Young, was killed Monday night after a bullet fired outside traveled through two walls and struck him as he lay inside a home in the 100 block of Rhine Place.</p>
<p>“We need some more help,” Commander Victor Joseph said. “We need the good people of the city of Pittsburgh to help us here, to help Zykier’s family here.”</p>
<p>Zykier was caught in the crossfire of an apparent shootout between multiple people in which many rounds were fired, Commander Joseph said.&nbsp;“There were numerous witnesses out there yesterday evening, and we need their help.”</p>
<p>Commander Joseph said the police already received several 911 calls from people who reported the shooting, but those people asked to remain anonymous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detectives processed evidence through the night on Monday and were investigating again Monday morning. No arrests have been made yet.</p>
<p>Police noted there have been 10 shootings, five of which were fatal, in the past seven days, but said there was no evidence to suggest the shootings are directly related to each other.</p>
<p>“Zykier Young should not be dead,” police Chief Scott Schubert said. “And my heart breaks for the family. I can’t even imagine what they’re going through today with the loss of their child. It’s senseless.”</p>
<p>Chief Schubert also said his heart was with the officers who responded to the shooting. A sergeant and at least two other officers took Zykier from the house and tried to apply pressure to his wound while they transported him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>“This is something they’re going to have to live with the rest of their life with what they experienced,” Chief Schubert said. “And we’re going to make sure we get them the help that they need to deal with that.”</p>
<p>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said authorities would do whatever it takes to apprehend those who are responsible for recent acts of gun violence, and said he has received multiple offers from state and local agencies offering their assistance with investigations.&nbsp;“And we may take them up on that.”</p>
<p>Police have obtained surveillance video of the shooting and ballistic evidence from the scene. They have a description of at least one suspect involved in Monday night’s shooting, but Commander Joseph declined to give more information since it is a&nbsp;“very active investigation.”</p>
<p>He said the motivation behind the shooting was&nbsp;“To enact violence on another.”</p>
<p>Zykier’s death “really tugs on the emotional heartstrings of everybody, and if people can’t rally around and support this investigation and give information here—this is a baby,” Commander Joseph said. “This is an innocent, innocent baby.”</p>
