<p>WASHINGTON — After the Federal Reserve on Monday made another batch of extraordinary moves to ease the growing credit crunch in America, it had limited effects in calming financial markets as some economists offered grimmer predictions of the severity of the coronavirus-induced economic crisis.</p>
<p>The Fed committed to buying an unlimited amount of government bonds to help keep credit markets from freezing up. Strains to the financial system have emerged in recent days because businesses are scrambling to get as much cash in their hands to pay expenses and stay afloat in an economy largely shut down by the virus.</p>
<p>“This is almost the last salvo they have. They’ve reached their limit,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Bank in New York. “If this doesn’t work to support financial conditions and the free flow of credit, I don’t know what will.”</p>
<p>The central bank’s announcement came as somewhat of a surprise, and it initially helped to soften the blow expected to stock markets after Senate negotiations on a fiscal stimulus packaged faltered Sunday —&nbsp;but the gains did not last. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 582 points, and there was still little appetite for bond purchases beyond U.S. Treasurys because so much uncertainty about the virus remains.</p>
<p>“The Fed’s showing they’re going to throw everything they have at the problem. Right now, we need fiscal policy,” said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody’s Analytics.</p>
<p>Lawmakers and Trump administration officials were trying to reach a compromise on a nearly $2 trillion package of measures to prevent the economy from falling deeper into recession.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, in a sobering analysis Monday, said it now sees the jobless rate, 3.5% in February, surging to a record-high average of 12.8% in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The investment banking firm predicted that U.S. gross domestic product would contract in that quarter at an annualized rate of 30%, which would be a 74-year low.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley economists are not forecasting a Great Depression as in the 1930s, in large part because of stronger policy responses. But they warned that the downturn would be far worse than the Great Recession in 2007-09 if the virus peaks later than April or May.</p>
<p>The Fed, which previously dropped its main interest rate to near zero, said Monday that it would buy as much U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities as needed to ensure that credit, the lifeblood of the economy, keeps flowing to businesses and consumers. Previously, the central bank had committed to purchasing $700 billion worth of the government-backed debt.</p>
<p>The Fed also moved to make it easier for banks to lend money, including establishing a lending facility similar to the one used during the 2008 financial crisis that will allow the central bank to buy securities backed by student, auto and credit card loans, as well as business loans made through the Small Business Administration. The Fed also expanded its facilities to include certain kinds of corporate and municipal debt.</p>
<p>“The coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world,” the Fed said in announcing its actions.</p>
<p>“While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions. Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.”</p>
<p>The Fed’s actions won’t prevent thousands — perhaps millions — of businesses from shutting down, and almost certainly won’t prevent a recession. But they might limit the damage and allow for a faster recovery.</p>

<p>“You can’t prevent some of the losses that are occurring,” said Nellie Liang, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former director of financial stability for the Fed. “You want to make sure that at the end of the period where the economy is affected by this crisis and shut down, that you haven’t left everyone in such a bad place that you can’t recover quickly.”</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, American businesses right now fall into two groups. In the first category are companies, like airlines, hotel chains and cruise ship operators, that have seen their revenue more or less wiped out by the pandemic. Congress might step in to bail some of those companies out, but there isn’t much that the Fed can do for them.</p>
<p>Instead, the Fed’s actions are focused on the second set of businesses. These are companies that are basically healthy but in danger because of the freeze-up in financial markets. Some have been insulated from the outbreak’s effects but rely on debt as part of their normal operations. Others have lost business because of the virus but could survive if they could borrow to cover their expenses.</p>
<p>If those businesses start to fail, there will be more layoffs and still more business failures — an economic nose-dive that could be harder to pull out of. The Fed is trying to contain the damage and prevent that cascade effect.</p>
<p>“If these big corporations don’t have financing or they’re losing their access to credit, it means they’re going to have to close their doors and fire workers, and that multiplies into the real economy quickly and severely,” said Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. If that happens, she said, “this economic recession spirals and becomes deeper and much more prolonged.”</p>
<p>Analysts said the Fed’s new steps will go a long way in warding off a financial crisis, but they aren’t likely to be enough to calm investors or deal with the underlying problem inflicting markets and the real economy.</p>
<p>“The announcement is good,” said Rupkey, but “the only thing that’s going to stop this is letting people come out of their homes again.”</p>
<p>Julia Coronado, president of economic consultancy MacroPolicy Perspectives, thinks&nbsp;“the Fed is well aware of the optics and the messaging. It’s not always clear to people that buying billions in mortgage securities helps them, even though it does.”</p>
<p>There is a consensus among economists that until the outbreak is brought under control, economic policy can do only so much. And while the Fed has greatly expanded its toolbox in recent years, there are steps that only Congress can take, like sending checks to individual households, cutting taxes or providing aid directly to state and local governments or to businesses.</p>
<p>But the Fed’s advantage, Meyer said, is speed.</p>
<p>“The Fed is moving quickly, they’re being creative, and they’re doing whatever they can to support the flow of credit in the economy,” she said.</p>
<p>Will that be enough? “Time will tell,” she said.</p>
