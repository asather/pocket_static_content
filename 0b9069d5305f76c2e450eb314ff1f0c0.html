<p>In an offseason filled with staff changes, Penn State has to deal with yet another one — this time on the defensive side of the ball.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Defensive line coach Sean Spencer has accepted a job with the New York Giants in the NFL, according to multiple reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spencer has been with Nittany Lions coach James Franklin ever since Franklin was at Vanderbilt and was responsible for an extremely strong defensive line over his tenure at Penn State.</p>
<p>Among others, Spencer oversaw the development of players such as Anthony Zettel of the San Francisco 49ers, Carl Nassib of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Yetur Gross-Matos, who will almost certainly be drafted in the NFL this year.</p>
<p>Under Spencer, Penn State’s defensive line became one of its strongest positional units, especially in 2019. The defensive front helped the Nittany Lions finish with the fifth-best run defense in the country, the seventh-most sacks and the 11th-most tackles for loss.</p>
<p>That type of production paid off on the recruiting side, too, as Spencer was thought to be one of Penn State’s best recruiters on staff. In the 2020 class alone, he helped the Nittany Lions lock down six defensive line signees, including four-stars Cole Brevard, Coziah Izzard and Amin Vanover.</p>
<p>Given all of that success, Spencer will leave large shoes to fill for whomever Penn State hires to replace him. One of his players, defensive tackle Antonio Shelton, already spoke out on Twitter, saying,&nbsp;“I can’t put into words how much he means to all of us, he’s the reason why we’re here. Without him, there is no us. Can’t thank him enough for all he’s done. This one hurts but I’m beyond happy for my OG!”</p>
<p>Spencer’s departure marks the fourth assistant coach to leave the Nittany Lions this offseason. Former offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne left to become Old Dominion’s head coach before the Cotton Bowl, former offensive line coach Matt Limegrover parted ways with Penn State on Dec. 31 and former wide receivers coach Gerad Parker left to take West Virginia’s offensive coordinator spot shortly after that.</p>
<p>Those three have been replaced by Kirk Ciarrocca (offensive coordinator), Phil Trautwein (offensive line) and Taylor Stubblefield (wide receivers).</p>
<p>And now, Franklin will have to fill yet another open spot on his staff heading into the 2020 season.</p>
