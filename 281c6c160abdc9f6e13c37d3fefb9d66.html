<h1>WVU suspends in-person classes amid rising COVID-19 cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>West Virginia University on Monday suspended in-person classes at its Morgantown classes following increases in cases of COVID-19 on the campus.</p>
<p>Undergraduate classes will move online through Friday, Sept. 25, a release from the university says. Students who are already in clinical rotations in their Health Sciences courses will not go online.</p>
<p>Graduate and professional courses may continue in-person instruction. Activities on other WVU campuses are to continue as planned.</p>
<p>The change comes after the university&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/09/06/West-Virginia-University-COVID-19-coronavirus-29-WVU-students-suspended/stories/202009060191" target="_blank">suspended 29 students</a>&nbsp;after a member of the&nbsp;Theta Chi fraternity tested positive for the virus but attended a party even after being told to self-isolate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wvu.edu/return-to-campus/daily-test-results/morgantown#daily-campus-testing" target="_blank">Campus testing results</a> show 85 students tested positive for COVID-19 out of nearly 800 students and staff tested between Sept. 1 and Sept. 3, the latest date for available information.</p>
<p>Since August 10, at least 713 students of the Morgantown campus needed to quarantine, likely because of close contact with someone who tested positive for the virus, the university said.</p>
<p>The university said it would evaluate public health conditions on Sept. 23 and determine whether students will be able to return to classes the following Monday, Sept. 28.</p>
<p>“If any students traveled home for the holiday weekend and have their materials to learn remotely, we ask those students to remain where they are right now,” Dean of Students Corey Farris wrote in a statement.&nbsp;“However, we are strongly advising students who did not travel over the weekend to remain in Morgantown during this time.”</p>
<p>The school advised on-campus students to only leave the Morgantown area for emergencies. Likewise, off-campus students were told not to visit the campus and to stay at their Morgantown residence unless it is necessary to leave.</p>
<p>WVU will update its <a href="https://www.wvu.edu/return-to-campus/what-you-need-to-know/testing" target="_blank">COVID-19 testing dashboard</a> at 2 p.m. Monday and officials said additional details on the class transition would be shared Monday afternoon.</p>
