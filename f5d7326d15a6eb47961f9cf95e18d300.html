<p>Ohiopyle State Park officials are seeking the public’s help in identifying a vandal or vandals who spray painted “several hundred” feet of rock in the Main Falls Area over the weekend.</p>
<p>Ranger supervisor John Kaminsky first discovered the graffiti on the Ferncliff side of the area about 8 a.m. Sunday morning while opening the Main Falls gate, according to park manager Kenneth Brisbee.</p>
<p>Mr. Brisbee told the Post-Gazette Monday morning that officials were unsure when the vandalism occurred, but after alerting the public on its Facebook page the park got reports from visitors that the graffiti was spotted as early as Friday.</p>
<p>“The most upsetting thing for us is that it’s one of the most scenic areas in the Laurel Highlands,” Mr. Brisbee said. “People come from all over the world to snap their pictures there and it’s just a shame that someone would take it upon themself to deface that.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brisbee said that the rocks were marked with paintings of snow flakes, lady bugs and hearts. The graffiti falls on a “pretty environmentally sensitive area,” so officials will have to proceed with caution while attempting to clean the rock, he said.</p>

<p>The park manager said there are usually no surveillance cameras in the Main Falls Area.</p>
<p>This was not the first instance of vandalism at the park, Mr. Brisbee added, but an act of this magnitude is a first for the Main Falls. “There are several residents that have lived there their whole lives and never recall that area being vandalized,” he said.</p>
<p>Park law enforcement rangers are currently investigating. If found, a suspect faces charges of vandalism and a fine of an amount that depends on the cost of cleanup, Mr. Brisbee said.</p>
<p>Anyone with information is asked to contact Ohiopyle park officials at 724-329-8591.</p>
