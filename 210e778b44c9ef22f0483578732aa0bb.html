<h1>Shell's petrochemical plant, other construction projects await state's verdict on resuming work</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>By Thursday evening, about 3% of Pennsylvania’s one million businesses had asked the state for an exemption from Gov. Tom Wolf’s shutdown order.</p>
<p>The number is likely to inch up a bit as the fevered period for companies to apply for waivers ends at 5 p.m. on Friday. Many still haven’t received an answer, including Shell Chemical Appalachia’s cracker plant in Potter Township.</p>
<p>More than 35,000 businesses are seeking to keep their doors open as the state tries to restrict movement to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>Businesses across the state ground to a halt on March 18 when Mr. Wolf ordered all non-life-sustaining work to cease for two weeks, later extending the closures until further notice. In the days that followed the initial announcement, a number of firms and trade associations lobbied the state government to either be reclassified as life-sustaining — coal miners and accountants, for example — or be granted waivers from the order to continue operating.</p>
<p>The construction industry, in particular, has pushed to for more blanket exemptions, arguing it’s both life-sustaining and is capable of following CDC-guidance on safety and social distancing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“From what I’m hearing today, they’re supposed to be letting heavy construction start up again,” said Philip Ameris, president and business manager for the Laborers’ District Council of Western Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, though, it’s just speculation.</p>
<p>Mr. Ameris was encouraged to receive a list of 61 PennDOT projects across the state that were deemed <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/04/03/PennDOT-resume-road-work-Allegheny-County-Beaver-County-18-projects/stories/202004030130" target="_blank">critical enough</a> to continue. Of those, 18 are in Southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“The number one concern for us is safety of our members,” he said. “But a lot of our members are calling and asking to go back to work, following safety procedures. I know a lot of the contractors are talking about taking guys’ temperatures before going on to the job.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ameris acknowledged that with understanding about how the novel coronavirus is transmitted changing daily — for example, researchers now suspect a large percentage of the population may be asymptomatic carriers — it’s hard to keep safety plans consistent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One project in question is the Shell Chemical Appalachia cracker plant where just last month more than 8,000 workers were building a petrochemical complex in Potter Township.</p>
<p>Shell suspended construction just days before Mr. Wolf ordered the shutdown,&nbsp;after pressure from workers and local officials mounted.</p>
<p>A week ago, the company filed for a waiver that would “involve a significantly reduced workforce,” said Shell spokesman Michael Marr earlier this week.</p>
<p>Two employees who haven’t been at the site since the March 18 shutdown have since tested positive for COVID-19 and Shell asked all those who worked closely with them to self-isolate for 14 days.</p>
<p>Mr. Ameris, whose members are part of the workforce at the petrochemical project, said Shell has spent the past few weeks disinfecting surfaces and working up protocols for a return to construction that complies with CDC guidance. He’s heard workers will be assigned far-apart seats in the lunch tents, for example, and that the buses that carry employees from their cars to the site will be limited to 10 riders at a time.</p>
<p>The health crisis itself might bring work to Mr. Ameris’ union. If the David L. Lawrence Convention Center is converted into hospital overflow space, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/31/Allegheny-County-Pennsylvania-COVID-19-coronavirus-cases-deaths-March-31-health-snapshot/stories/202003310084" target="_blank">as has been discussed</a>, his members will be the ones setting up temporary rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Some granted, more denied</strong></p>
<p>As of the end of the day Thursday, the state’s Department of Community and Economic Development had granted 5,693 waivers, denied 8,952 requests and determined that another 8,365 did not require a waiver because they fit the life-sustaining definition outlined in the shutdown order.</p>
<p>“When the exemption process began, the commonwealth was the only state to implement a process that allowed businesses to obtain clarification about their life-sustaining status or to seek exemptions from the closure orders,” spokeswoman Casey Smith said.</p>
<p>“More than 13,000 businesses have remained open in some capacity, while still employing important social distancing and other mitigation measures needed to slow the spreading of COVID-19, because of the commonwealth’s process.”</p>
<p>Jim Mall, who chairs the construction law group at Meyer, Unkovic &amp; Scott LLP, said he’s advised all his clients to submit waivers by the 5 p.m. deadline and expect that will be their last chance to plead their case.</p>
<p>“I would think if you file something tomorrow, you’re out of luck,” he said.</p>
<p>A number of his clients who applied last week still haven’t heard back, which is understandable given the volume of requests, he said. Those who have been able to successfully demonstrate that they provide a service to those on the life-sustaining list have been able to gain exemptions, he said, even if the bulk of their work remains suspended.</p>
<p>Mr. Mall has also fielded a number of calls from clients who complained that their competitors are “out there doing work in broad daylight” while they’re observing the shutdown order.</p>
<p>But it’s not clear if those competitors have been granted waivers or are disobeying the law.</p>
<p>There’s no publicly-available database of exemptions and it’s not unknown how violations are being enforced.</p>
