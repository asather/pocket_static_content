<h1>Nonprofits Rebuilding Together Pittsburgh, Conservation Consultants to merge </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two Pittsburgh nonprofits focused on healthy and energy-efficient housing are merging.</p>
<p>Rebuilding Together Pittsburgh and Conservation Consultants Inc. said their boards voted to combine effective July 1.</p>
<p>The merged entity will be known as Rebuilding Together Pittsburgh and will be based at 7800 Susquehanna, a small business incubator in Homewood where RTP is expanding its space.</p>
<p>A combined staff of 29 will be led by Steve Hellner-Burris, the chief executive of RTB.</p>
<p>RTB, founded in 1993, rehabilitates homes for seniors, veterans, people with disabilities and others in need in Allegheny County.</p>
<p>CCI, founded in 1978, conducts energy audits and offers other technical education and assistance about energy conservation for homes and commercial buildings.</p>
<p>The organizations have collaborated in the past on a Green &amp; Healthy Homes Initiative Compact and repairs to more than 50 homes in the city neighborhoods of East Liberty, the Hill District and Homewood.</p>
<p>“We have always shared common values and a commitment to serve individuals and families with fewer resources,” said Mr. Hellner-Burris. “This merger creates a stronger organization with more expertise to identify and remedy the compounding, home-based issues affecting our clients such as mold, radon, and carbon monoxide.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to be providing more environmentally friendly, energy efficient, and whole-house home repair services to create sustainable healthy homes in our region,” said Jeaneen Zappa, executive director of Conservation Consultants, Inc. “We are setting the stage for more robust, combined services and a thoughtful advocacy and community engagement approach.”</p>
