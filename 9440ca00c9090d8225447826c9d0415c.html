<h1>PNC: Customers checking for stimulus payments caused technical issues </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PNC Bank customers were having problems accessing their online or mobile banking accounts Wednesday morning, a day when 80 million Americans were expected <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/04/15/Stimulus-checks-payment-IRS-deposit-coronavirus-Trump/stories/202004150085" target="_blank">to receive their direct deposited stimulus checks</a> from the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PNC spokesperson&nbsp;Marcey Zwiebel said the issues were a result of an influx in customers accessing their accounts at the same time to check for their stimulus payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Like other banks, PNC customers have experienced intermittent mobile and care center access today,” Ms. Zwiebel said in a statement. “This is the result of an unprecedented volume of customers using these channels to check their accounts for Economic Impact Payments and other forms of financial hardship relief. Our technical teams are engaged and we appreciate our customers’ patience as we work as quickly as we can to address the issue.”</p>
<p>PNC’s customer service Twitter account replied to several user complaints, saying the bank’s technical team was working to resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some customers who attempted to log into their accounts from a mobile device received an alert from PNC that read,&nbsp;“We are working to make Mobile Banking available as soon as possible. If you need immediate access to your account information, please use PNC Online Banking by visiting pnc.com.”</p>
