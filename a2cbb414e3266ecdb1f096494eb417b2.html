<h1>Pirates close PNC Park to outsiders, adjust summer camp schedule</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Following Allegheny County’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/02/COVID-19-coronavirus-Allegheny-County-Western-Pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-200/stories/202007020115" target="_blank">decision Thursday</a> to close bars, restaurants and casinos and prohibit gatherings that include 25 or more people, the Pirates have acted accordingly by closing PNC Park to outside entities, including media, and adjusting their schedule for the resumption of spring training.</p>
<p>The Pirates announced the move Thursday and also explained that they would be altering their summer camp schedule “to ensure all guidelines are being followed.”</p>
<p>“Team officials will continue to work directly with state, county and city officials to bring baseball back to Pirates fans as safely as possible,” the Pirates said in a statement. “The health of Pirates players, coaches, staff and fans remains paramount during this time.”</p>
<p>According to a source, the Pirates were ultimately the ones who made the call to hit the pause button, and they did it more out of caution than anything. The extra time will allow them to fully grasp the county's order and its impact on the ballpark.</p>
<p>It will also afford the Pirates time to consult with government officials to ensure they’re doing everything possible to keep everyone safe and adhere to the MLB guidelines that were developed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The hope is that this is relatively short-lived, the source said.</p>
<p>The move comes a day before the Pirates were supposed to officially resume spring training via staggered workouts, allowing media to watch and cover them by speaking with manager Derek Shelton and select players via Zoom call.</p>
<p>No more than 35 media members were supposed to be inside of PNC Park, although a team spokesman said on Thursday afternoon that it was unlikely more than 25 would occupy the press box at once.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Pirates expressed no concern that they would have to change their plans for summer camp.</p>
<p>The move made Thursday applies solely to bars, restaurants and casinos, an Allegheny County Health Department spokesperson reiterated to the Post-Gazette, an indication that the Pirates keeping a lid on PNC Park wasn’t a direct requirement of the health department’s move.</p>
<p>The health department spokesperson also pointed out that the state or Major League Baseball (which obviously includes the Pirates) would be the only ones who would adjust the summer camp schedule to ensure safety.</p>
<p>As part of its return-to-play plan, MLB worked with local and state authorities, as well as medical experts, to devise a set of health and safety protocols, the 2020 Operating Manual totaling over 100 pages.</p>
<p>MLB teams are able to function somewhat independently of society because of these protocols, the frequency of COVID-19 testing they perform and the fact that activity is isolated, with anybody who hasn’t been tested kept away from those who have.</p>
<p>“Whatever Major League Baseball says we have to do, we’re going to do,” manager Derek Shelton said Wednesday when asked about the county’s first move (<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/01/Pirates-masks-Tom-Wolf-coronavirus-summer-camp-no-effect-Derek-Shelton-MLB-guidelines/stories/202007010161" target="_blank">to require masks</a>) designed to combat a spike in cases.</p>
<p>It’s unclear exactly what the Pirates plan to do to adjust the schedule. Previously, they were supposed to have 40 players training at PNC Park and 19 more in Altoona.</p>
<p>The Pirates had planned to break those 40 into eight groups of five, with the groups changing daily. They were even going to utilize part of the main concourse at PNC Park.</p>
<p>The hope here is that this is a temporary thing, cases normalize and the Pirates are able to proceed as originally anticipated. However, that doesn’t seem terribly likely given what has transpired over the past couple of days.</p>
<p>And not that this trumps the public health situation, but the Pirates are still making players and Shelton available to the media Friday via Zoom calls.</p>
