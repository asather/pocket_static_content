<h1>Steelers awarded a compensatory third-round draft pick for 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was widely expected, but now it’s official that the Steelers will have an extra draft pick after all next month.</p>
<p>The NFL announced Tuesday afternoon its compensatory selections for the 2020 draft, and the Steelers are one of 10 teams receiving an additional selection in the third round. They will pick 102nd overall, which is the 38th and fifth-to-last choice in the third. There are 32&nbsp;“comp” picks spread across 15 teams, but that’s the only one for the Steelers.</p>
<p>There’s a formula for why and where NFL franchises receive extra draft spots, based on free agents they gain and lose the previous season. For the Steelers, the NFL factored in the loss of running back Le’Veon Bell and tight end Jesse James, and the gain of starting cornerback Steven Nelson, according to a league news release.</p>
<p>“Compensatory free agents are determined by a formula based on salary, playing time and postseason honors,” the announcement reads. “The formula was developed by the NFL Management Council.”</p>
<p>Without pick No. 102, the Steelers wouldn’t have had a spot at all in the third round. They traded their original third-round pick to Denver last year to move up to 10th overall, where they took Devin Bush. Of course, they also don’t have a first-rounder this year after trading what wound up being No. 18 overall to Miami for Pro Bowl safety Minkah Fitzpatrick in September.</p>
<p>Four teams — the Texans, Patriots (twice), Giants and Seahawks — will make five comp picks before the Steelers, who most notably drafted star running back James Conner with one in the third round three years ago.</p>
