<p>WASHINGTON — Confronted by persistent questions about his military action in the Middle East, President Donald Trump and his top officials offered a string of fresh explanations Friday, with Mr. Trump now contending Iranian militants had planned major attacks on four U.S. embassies.</p>
<p>Just hours earlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said the U.S. didn’t know when or where attacks might occur. Mr. Trump and other officials insisted anew that Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani had posed an imminent threat to the U.S., but they rebuffed attempts to explain what they meant by “imminent.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, meanwhile, announced additional sanctions against Iran, which he had promised after a barrage of missiles fired by the Islamic State against American bases in Iraq earlier this week.</p>
<p>Those Iranian missiles, which caused no casualties, were prompted in turn by the U.S. drone strike that killed Soleimani last week in Baghdad. That U.S. assault set off a chain of events that included the unintentional downing of a Ukrainian jetliner by an Iranian missile and calls by the Iraqi government to expel U.S. troops from their country.</p>
<p>At the White House, Mr. Trump issued an executive order adding additional U.S. sanctions to the already long list his administration had imposed in an effort to force Iran to accept a new agreement that would curb its nuclear program and to halt support for militant groups throughout the Middle East.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump declared the U.S. was holding Iran responsible for attacks against the U.S. as well as a threat to U.S. service members, diplomats and civilians — an apparent reference to the justification for killing Soleimani.</p>
<p>But Mr. Trump and others faced continuing questions over their claims of an “imminent” threat. Members of Congress said Mr. Pompeo and other officials did not provide sufficient detail or justification in briefings.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Trump had said U.S. embassies were threatened. The secretary of state broadened it to include “American facilities,” including military bases throughout the region. “This was going to happen, and American lives were at risk,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump gave a more worrisome number but still no specifics in a later comment.</p>
<p>“I can reveal that I believe it probably would’ve been four embassies,” he told Fox News in an interview taped Friday.</p>
