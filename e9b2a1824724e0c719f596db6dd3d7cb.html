<h1>Pirates to open with exhibition games in Cleveland</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates are finalizing plans to play the Cleveland Indians for three exhibition games on July 18, 20 and 22, multiple sources told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Friday.</p>
<p>The first and last of those three games will be at PNC Park, while the middle one will be at Progressive Field in Cleveland.</p>
<p>Under Major League Baseballâ€™s return-to-play rules, teams are allowed to play three exhibition contests, although not everyone plans to play three. The Pirates have been adamant from the start about wanting to play their three.</p>
<p>Although plans are still being finalized, the games will likely be broadcast on TV and radio in both markets.</p>
<p>The Pirates open the 2020 season July 24 against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium.</p>
