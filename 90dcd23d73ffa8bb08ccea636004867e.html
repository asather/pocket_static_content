<h1>Gov. DeWine eases Ohio’s ‘stay at home’ order, keeps large group limits</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — What was once an order from Gov. Mike DeWine’s administration that Ohioans stay home as much as possible in this era of coronavirus became a strong advisory on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the limit of mass gatherings of 10 or more individuals remains in place, so don’t plan on that Memorial Day backyard barbecue with 20 of your friends. And while weddings can still take place, those big wedding receptions remain on hold for now.</p>
<p>There’s been no word yet on amusement parks, fairs, or festivals.</p>

<p>“Our health advisory recommends but does not require that the rest of Ohioans stay at their place of residence when possible with the intent of lowering the rate of spread of COVID-19,” Mr. DeWine said.</p>
<p>What he now calls the Ohioans Protecting Ohioans order reflects the many changes the governor has made in recent weeks to gradually reopen Ohio’s economy — bars, restaurants, manufacturing, some amateur sports leagues, offices, retail stores, and others.</p>
<p>It no longer asks Ohioans to refrain from travel or to quarantine themselves when they return from outside the state. But he urged vulnerable populations —such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions — to protect themselves by staying home when they can.</p>
<p>“Use your common sense,” Mr. DeWine said. “This COVID virus is in every state, some more than others. I think I would watch who I interact with. I would try to keep that interaction to a minimum. ... If you have someone in your house who’s at high risk, you’re going to look at things differently...”</p>
<p>When asked what about life will be different on Wednesday than it was on Tuesday as a result of the latest order, Mr. DeWine, said, “Virtually nothing.” The semantic change from ‘order’ to ‘advisory’ also does not change the requirements businesses face when it comes to putting into practice safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus, like social distancing and disinfecting plans.</p>
<p>He said Ohio is entering a new phase in response to the coronavirus pandemic after the state was successful in flattening the increase in new infections and deaths.</p>
<p>“Without a vaccine, we concluded pretty early on that we’re going to have to learn to live with COVID-19 in our lives,” Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said. “We must learn to manage that risk individually and collectively.”</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine’s health director, Dr. Amy Acton, did not attend Tuesday’s briefing. Additional details were unavailable beyond Mr. DeWine saying she wasn’t “feeling well.”</p>
<p>Tuesday was not the first time Mr. DeWine has revised the rhetoric used to describe restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine previously rechristened his “stay-at-home” order first issued in March to the “safe at home” order as more of the economy received dates for reopening. Now officials say much of this order is considered an advisory, strongly recommending that Ohioans don’t put themselves and others at risk while keeping in place potential penalties for businesses that fail to meet new social distancing, hygiene, cleansing, mask, and other safety precautions upon which their reopenings have been conditioned.</p>
<p>The numbers released Tuesday sent a conflicting message as to the progress Ohio has made in controlling the disease. New infections numbered 498 for a new total of 28,952. The increase was below the daily average over the last 21 days that Mr. DeWine watches for trends.</p>
<p>But the number of deaths climbed by 63 — above the 21-day average — to 1,720. Increases in hospitalizations and intensive care unit stays were both well above their averages.</p>
<p>In Lucas County Tuesday, public officials reported 2011 total cases of coronavirus and 203 deaths.</p>
<p>“In the last 24 hours there was a spike, but you really have to look at these from the big picture, look at the last 21 days,” Mr. DeWine said. “What we see is the curve is fairly flat.”</p>
<p>The governor favored statewide policy when it came to shutting down and gradually reopening Ohio’s economy over doing it piecemeal county by county as some other states have done. He has said he is also prepared to reverse course and start shutting things down again if the risk doesn’t pay off and the rate of infection numbers spike.</p>
<p>But he said he doesn’t know yet whether new shutdowns would also occur statewide, regardless of where the hot spots are.</p>
<p>“I hope we never get to that question,” he said. “Local health departments have the ability to issue more restrictive orders. ... I hope we don’t get to the point where we have to go back. We’ve seen that happen in several European countries. ... What we do in the next few weeks is really going to determine exactly where we are.”</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, Mr. DeWine reported the state’s first death at the Ohio Veterans Home in Sandusky, a 427-bed nursing home facility. In all, 28 residents and five staff members have tested positive there. There have been no positive tests so far at the veterans’ home in Georgetown in southwest Ohio.</p>
<p>The state also reported the second coronavirus-related death of a staff member at the Correctional Reception Center south of Columbus that serves as the intake location for new prisoners coming into the system. The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction began accepting new inmates on Monday, but is holding them for 25 days at the reception center before transferring them to other facilities.</p>
<p>In all, four DRC staff members and 61 inmates have died since the crisis began.</p>
<p>The Ohio National Guard sent personnel into the Belmont Correctional Institution in St. Clairsville in southwest Ohio to help staff in the latest prison hot spot for infections.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday evening, the governor’s office did not plan to hold a coronavirus briefing on Wednesday.</p>
