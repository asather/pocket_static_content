<h1>Penguins sign college free agent Josh Maniscalco</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins added some young depth to their blue line Friday when they signed college free agent defenseman Josh Maniscalco out of Arizona State. The three-year, entry-level contract begins in 2020-21 and runs through the 2022-23 campaign.</p>
<p>Maniscalco, 21, was one of college hockey’s most productive defensemen last season. Among blue liners, his 11 goals ranked tied for second-most, and his 32 points were sixth-most at his position.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-2, 200-pound defenseman shoots right handed. After Kris Letang and John Marino, the other top righties in the organization include Chad Ruhwedel and Zach Trotman. Justin Schultz is an unrestricted free agent. It remains to be seen if or when Maniscalco will be able to help the Penguins at the NHL level, but his signing gives them another righty with offensive upside.</p>
<p>“Josh is a solid puck-moving, offensive defenseman,” Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said in a statement. “He jumps into the rush and plays a style that is complementary to our group. We think highly of his character and are happy to add Josh to the organization.”</p>
<p>In two seasons at Arizona State, Maniscalco tallied 52 points in 71 games. His 52 points are sixth-most in team history. He was also teammates with Penguins’ co-owner Mario Lemieux’s son, Austin, both seasons.</p>
<p>The Perkiomenville, Pa., native played one season in the USHL with the Dubuque Fighting Saints. He served as team captain and accumulated 32 points in 59 games. Maniscalco, who went undrafted, was also a member of the U.S. National Team Development Program for two seasons from 2015-17.</p>
<p>Under Rutherford, the Penguins have aggressively targeted college free agents as a way to restock the prospect pool after dealing picks for win-now players. Among the college free agents the team has signed in recent years are Conor Sheary, Carter Rowney, Zach Aston-Reese, Casey DeSmith and Jake Lucchini.</p>
<p><strong>More signings</strong></p>
<p>In other transactional news this week, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins signed forwards Felix Robert and Luke Stevens to AHL contracts.</p>
<p>Robert, a teammate of Penguins 2019 first-round pick Samuel Poulin, was one of the most productive players in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League last season. He tallied 92 points for the Sherbrooke Phoenix, fourth-most points in the QMJHL.</p>
<p>Stevens, meanwhile, is the son of former Penguins forward and two-time Stanley Cup champion Kevin Stevens. The 23-year-old Stevens played four seasons at Yale, where he accumulated 19 goals and 16 assists.</p>
<p><strong>Rights relinquished</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins relinquished the rights to two former draft picks this week in Ryan Jones and Nikita Pavlychev.</p>
<p>Pavlychev, 23, is a 6-foot-7, 225-pound forward. The Penguins took something of a flyer on him in the seventh round of the 2015 draft. Through four seasons at Penn State, he recorded 70 points in 137 games.</p>
<p>Jones, 24, was a fourth-round draft choice in 2016. In four seasons with Nebraska-Omaha, he appeared in 141 games and recorded 42 points.</p>
