<h1>Trump campaign files its evidence in mail voting suit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Asked by a federal judge in Pittsburgh to lay out its evidence of how mail-in balloting can "sow chaos" in an election and foster an environment of voter fraud, Donald Trump's presidential campaign filed more than 500 pages of documents last week that it claims show votes are at risk of being diluted by Democratic policies.</p>
<p>But the filing —&nbsp;obtained this weekend by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette — does not include specific evidence that suggests rampant and widespread fraud encouraged by a flawed and insecure mail-in system.</p>
<p>Instead, evidence is presented as a series of specific examples of election malfeasance that the Trump campaign says is enough to prove their point — while critics say it proves Mr. Trump is vastly exaggerating.</p>
<p>While much of the filing is basic information about poll watchers, ballot drop boxes and right-to-know requests, it also includes several news articles that detail instances of fraud, cluttered voter rolls and bribery — a majority of which have nothing to do with vote-by-mail directly but attempt to make the campaign's case that any fraud in the electoral process is too much fraud and ripe for abuse.</p>
<p>It hones in — more than once — on a scandal earlier this year in Philadelphia, where an election judge pleaded guilty to taking bribes to run up Democratic vote totals, according to a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/election-fraud-philadelphia-dmocrats-federal-charges-president-donald-trump-republicans-domenick-demuro-20200522.html" target="_blank">Philadelphia Inquirer article</a> referenced in the filing.</p>
<p>In that case, a former congressman was also charged, alleged to have bribed the election judge and conspired with him to "add fraudulent votes on the voting machines -- also known as 'ringing up' votes -- for [the congressman's] clients and preferred candidates, thereby diluting the value of ballots cast by actual voters," a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-congressman-charged-ballot-stuffing-bribery-and-obstruction" target="_blank">release from the U.S. Department of Justice</a> read at the time.</p>
<p>Though the Trump campaign pounced on it at the time and called it proof of the need for Republicans to "fight back against the Democrats' nationwide vote-by-mail push to destroy the integrity of elections," none of the allegations in the case involved mail-in voting —&nbsp;which is at the center of the camp's recent legal effort in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump's campaign, along with several local GOP congressmen, is suing Pennsylvania and the election boards of its 67 counties to put an end, among other things, to "unmonitored ad hoc drop boxes" for mail-in and absentee ballots, which they claim would allow "illegal [absentee] and mail-in voting, ballot harvesting, and other fraud to occur and/or go undetected, and will result in dilution of validly cast ballots," according to the original suit.</p>
<p>In their suit, the Republicans allege that the "single greatest threat to free and fair elections" is "unmonitored" mail-in voting, and say that counties have implemented it in a "hazardous, hurried and illegal" manner.</p>
<p>Seeking evidence for Republican claims of fraud, the Sierra Club and Citizens for Pennsylvania's Future — two intervening parties in the suit — requested the Trump campaign provide documentation, which U.S. District Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan granted.</p>
<p>Suzanne Almeida, redistricting and representation counsel for Common Cause, another intervenor in the case, said the Trump campaign did not prove in their filing that voter fraud is rampant or that there are breakdowns in the mail-in voting system.</p>
<p>“There isn’t any evidence of voter fraud in what they have filed with the court, which leads me to believe — as we all know — that voter fraud is not the kind of problem that some people think it is,” Ms. Almeida said.</p>
<p>In a statement to the Post-Gazette, a senior Trump campaign official said "any amount of fraud is too much fraud," and that to win the case, they "must show that the Democrats' ridiculous policies dilute votes."</p>
<p>"The evidence of fraud we produced in our response, along with the legal flaws inherent in the Democrats’ policies that allow for double voting and standardless drop boxes, clearly demonstrate that vote dilution," the official said.</p>
<p>Among the articles and releases cited in the Trump campaign filing was one from the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/updates/case-update-election-fraud-in-197th-state-house-race-2" target="_blank">two years ago</a>&nbsp;announcing that a poll worker in Philadelphia pleaded guilty, along with a few other workers, in connection with voter fraud in a 2017 special election.</p>
<p>Though their crimes were not determined to have impacted the results of the state House race in question, the workers were involved in several incidents that the attorney general deemed "detailed harassment and intimidation against voters who wanted to vote for candidates of their choice but not the candidate being pushed by the city's Democratic Party machine," the release read.</p>
<p>The incidents included one Republican vote either not being cast or counted and a voter whose vote was tallied as a write-in for the Democrat, even though their vote was never completed or counted.</p>
<p>But in this case, too, none of the allegations involved mail-in or absentee voting.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign, in its attempt to prove that votes are being diluted and that voters are operating on an unequal playing field, is warning that voters could vote twice — once by mail, then in-person — without there being an immediate way for polling places to confirm whether the voter has already cast their ballot.</p>
<p>It makes reference in the recent filing, at one point, to 40 people voting twice in Philadelphia in June's primary election.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pa-primary-election-mail-ballots-double-voting-20200616.html" target="_blank">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>, 40 people did return a mail-in ballot and vote in person, but 36 were caught in time and their mail ballots excluded — leaving four double votes that had already been tallied. It was likely the result of the county processing 92,000 voters' mail ballot applications after Philadelphia's poll books were printed, the Inquirer reported.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign claims that this example and others of electors receiving multiple ballots, dropping off multiple ballots or returning someone else's ballot is evidence of vote dilution that will help make their case.</p>
<p>Ms. Almeida said there are&nbsp;“always a handful of bad actors,” but that&nbsp;“we have a system that is set up to catch and prosecute those bad actors.”</p>
<p>“I think all of the instances of voter fraud or election misconduct — because many of them are not fraud [and] ‘misconduct’ is a different word — that they have alleged are one-off incidents,” Ms. Almeida said. “They are not evidence of systemic issues with our voting systems.”</p>

<p>Officials involved with the creation of Pennsylvania’s upcoming COVID-19 notification app are worried about one issue above all others with the technology they hope will help contain the spread of the highly infectious virus: Privacy.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, at a press conference announcing the “COVID Alert PA” app would be ready to go in early September, Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine repeated multiple times, in different ways, that the app would tell a person if they were a close contact with someone who had tested positive “without compromising their identity or their location,” noting that the “entire system is anonymous,” and that the state is “concerned about maintaining privacy.”</p>
<p>When Allegheny County Health Department Director Debra Bogen was asked about the app a day later, one of the first issues she mentioned was similar: “The app the state selected is very conscientious and careful about privacy issues.”</p>
<p>In short, officials are deeply concerned any app would be seen as the kind of technology that spurs questions about government intrusion into our private lives —&nbsp;like the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/coronavirus-tracking-app-cheating-partners-married-south-korea-affair-a9514996.html" target="_blank">stories of the South Korean government</a> COVID-19 tracking app revealing love affairs while tracking people with the virus.</p>
<p>That has been an issue since the first idea of creating a “tracking app” —&nbsp;a phrase officials involved with Pennsylvania’s app don’t like, asking that reporters refer to it as a “notification” app — first came up early in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Shortly after tech giants Apple and Google in early April announced they were working together to develop the basic tracking technology for smartphones, the American Civil Liberties Union, among others, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-comment-applegoogle-covid-19-contact-tracing-effort" target="_blank">issued a declaration that any COVID-19 </a>tracing app be decentralized.</p>
<p>“People will only trust these systems if they protect privacy, remain voluntary, and store data on an individual's device, not a centralized repository,” the ACLU wrote.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania officials, and the company that created the app for the state, say that’s exactly what they’ve created.</p>
<p>The state’s app will let you know you were in “close contact” — defined as within 6 feet for 15 or more minutes — with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 sometime in the previous 14 days. But Dr. Levine said at her press conference, “It’s not going to store the specific location.”</p>
<p>“I know that people are concerned about that, that the government is somehow tracking their location,” she said. “It does not do that.”</p>
<p>While the voluntary app will tell a person — only if they downloaded the app — that they had a close contact with someone else who has the app, it will not say who the COVID-19 positive person was or where the contact occurred.</p>
<p>In addition, the Notification System Technology that Apple and Google developed that is the basis of Pennsylvania’s app, and most other states’s apps developed so far, will not tell health officials who the close contacts are. People will have to identify themselves to the health department after they receive an alert that tells them they were a close contact.</p>
<p>The state can only see three pieces of information: how many people total have uploaded the app; how many people who activated the app have uploaded a six-digit code the health department gave them if they have a positive test; and how many people were identified as a close contact overall.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania brought in experts from MIT to verify that “there’s nothing for citizens to worry about in terms of data protection and data privacy,” said Larry Breen, chief commercial officer for NearForm, the software company based in Waterford, Ireland, that developed the app for Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The state also brought in experts from the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Breen said, to make sure the app “delivers targeted messaging and helps citizens understand how to use the product, what it means to them, and, again, to help allay any fears and concerns, because there’s a lot of noise in the marketplace around data protection and privacy.”</p>
<p>The other states that have also rolled out statewide apps using the Apple and Google technology — Virginia, <a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/2020/08/14/state-of-north-dakota-updates-covid-19-tracing-app/" target="_blank">North Dakota</a> and <a href="https://county17.com/2020/08/15/wyoming-launches-new-covid-19-contact-app/" target="_blank">Wyoming</a>&nbsp;— all were deeply concerned about that as well.</p>
<p>Privacy and security “were at the top of our requirement list” when Virginia invited companies to bid to create a COVID-19 notification app, said Jeff Stover, the executive adviser in the office of the Virginia Health Commissioner who led the state’s effort.</p>
<p>The reasons for that are simply “because it’s an app being put out by the government,” he said. “In the world of public health, there’s a certain distrust of government, in particular in the African-American community because of cases like the Tuskegee syphilis study” where Black men with syphilis were left untreated by public health officials so they could study the disease.</p>
<p>“And there’s a whole different issue in the Hispanic community,” Mr. Stover said, “where they worry you’re tracking them because of illegal immigration issues.”</p>
<p>That’s a huge concern in this case, he said, because 50% of all of the people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in Virginia are Hispanic.</p>
<p>On top of that, he said, “There are groups that distrust the government in general.”</p>
<p>Virginia, which was <a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/northam-introduces-covidwise-covid-19-exposure-app/article_6cc61fba-a376-5297-b1c1-b63166d67ea7.html" target="_blank">the first state to get an app running statewide </a>using the Apple and Google technology, has done “pretty well” pushing the app out in the two weeks since it debuted, Mr. Stover said.</p>
<p>Nearly 400,000 people had downloaded the app by Thursday, Mr. Stover said, which is about 9.5% of all adults in the state ages 18 to 65 years old. That’s the target audience since about 80% of adults in that group have a cellphone.</p>
<p>Downloads have been growing by about 5,000 to 15,000 per day, but the state hopes to drive that further through a marketing campaign just getting started.</p>
<p>So far, just 19 people who have downloaded the app and tested positive have put in the six-digit pin that tells close contacts they tested positive, and only a few people have been identified as close contacts so far, Mr. Stover said, though he did not have an exact figure.</p>
<p>Ireland, using NearForm’s app, has been one of the worldwide success stories for COVID-19 notification systems, with just over 40% of its residents 16 years old and older downloading the app so far, Mr. Breen of NearForm said.</p>
<p>“It increased the effect of contract tracing,” he said, “with a 35% increase in identified contacts [of someone who had tested positive], so it makes your contact tracing team more effective.”</p>
<p>NearForm has also developed similar apps for Scotland, Northern Ireland, Gibraltar, and Delaware. The company is working with two other states who are close to announcing their apps, and is in the early stages of working with 10 to 15 other states or governments, Mr. Breen said.</p>
<p>Delaware, which is working to ensure its app will work both in Pennsylvania and Delaware because of the many people who commute back-and-forth, is equally concerned about people’s possible distrust of the technology.</p>
<p>“We hope we can overcome that,” said Jill Fredel, spokeswoman for Delaware’s Department of Health and Social Services. “Hopefully its use will spread through word of mouth as people tell each other, ‘I used it and found out I was a close contact.’”</p>
<p>So what will be the goal in Pennsylvania? Will 10% after two weeks be a good start? Will the state get 40% of adults to use the app?</p>
<p>No one knows.</p>
<p>“The reality of that is that as soon as we started seeing people actually use the app [in Ireland], even when it was super low numbers, it started having a positive impact,” Mr. Breen said.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine said while the state will roll out a marketing campaign to encourage people to download Pennsylvania’s app, she did not have a specific goal.</p>
<p>“Well, the more the better,” she said Tuesday. “It really just depends if more and more people in Pennsylvania do the right thing and download the app when it’s made available in September.</p>
<p>“The more people who have the app, the more effective it will be in this notification process.”</p>
