<h1>Paul Zeise mailbag: Chris Archer trade just keeps getting worse</h1>

<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> I just read about Chris Archer having surgery. That is unbelievable. Where does the Archer trade rank in your mind among the worst in Pittsburgh history? It has to be one of the five worst.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I had already said it was the worst trade in Pirates history last season. It will only continue to get worse as Austin Meadows and Tyler Glasnow continue to improve and contribute for the Rays. I never understood why Neal Huntington went after Archer. He was in the midst of three or four really mediocre seasons and was a guy whose reputation was that he will never live up to his potential. They gave up three really good prospects for a pitcher who gave them very little in return. I know some people point to the trade of Aramis Ramirez as the worst, but that one was purely a salary dump and there was no market because everyone knew they had to cut salary. This one was a baseball trade that has turned into a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Graymon:</strong> The owners can’t be serious about 50 games. That isn’t even a season. What do you think is the right number of games to make the MLB season legitimate?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I was OK with 82 games. I think 100 is the max, though, and it feels like they will settle on something like 75. I have no desire to watch baseball in December. And I know MLB doesn’t want to play games past the end of October. So there is a clear time frame that the season has to get in, and unless there are a bunch of doubleheaders I don’t see how you get more than about 100 games in. I would be OK with 75, but any less than that and it would start to feel a bit like a farce. And if it is 75, the Pirates will actually have a chance because all it would take is a hot streak of about 30 games to be right in the mix.</p>
<p><strong>Joshua:</strong> Who is better — Carey Price or Matt Murray? I feel like people are forgetting Murray has won two Stanley Cups.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> That is very true. Murray has actually won the Stanley Cup and Price has not. That is an important fact, but I still think Price is better. And Murray has not had a good season and has been very inconsistent since their last Stanley Cup, so who knows what the Penguins will get from him when they return? The key to me is he has been far better in the playoffs, so maybe he will take his game to the next level&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>William:</strong> Your article the other day said you would end all statements against racial injustice by famous people. What do you have against people speaking out against racial justice?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> You completely misunderstood what I said. I made it clear I think that athletes and famous people should voice their opinions. My objection is to these ridiculous, PR-cleansed, legal documents posing as statements. They are all trite, they all say the same thing and I am not sure what they are accomplishing. If people want to speak out, that is a good thing. We can hear them, we can see the pain in their face, understand their passion — that is helpful and that can lead to change. Some team going to Twitter and launching a statement because it seems like the right thing to do is a waste of our time.</p>
<p><strong>Zach:&nbsp;</strong>Why do some of these athletes feel they have to talk about the murder of George Floyd, but say nothing about other injustices? It comes across as selective outrage.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I disagree. I think the George Floyd murder is very tangible and easy for everyone to understand. It is a complex issue overall — racism, that is — but the specific example is easy for people to understand and be outraged about. And I think people that are speaking out about this incident have a track record, for the most part, about speaking out on a lot of issues. This one is standing out right now because it is an easy one for people to understand even if you don’t understand institutional racism and white privilege. You can understand a police officer murdering someone on the street on camera for all to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jerry:</strong> Paul, you are an NBA fan. I’ve heard you talk about it many times. What can you tell me about Wes Unseld and also where do you rank him among all-time great players?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> He was 6-foot-7 and one of the most physical players in NBA history. He was a center and played against guys much bigger than him, but he was dominant. He averaged 14 rebounds per game and he also was known as one of the best passing big men in the league. I don’t know where he ranks in league history overall, but I would say this — Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Shaq, Hakeem Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing and Tim Duncan are all higher than him on the list of centers, but that’s about it. He is a legend and one of the all-time greats. He is also one of the nicest and most classy individuals I have ever met.</p>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Do you think Pitt could beat Clemson in the ACC championship game?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I bet it would be a much better game than the last one. I think Pitt is going to be very good this season. And if the offensive line comes together, I could see them winning 11 or 12 games and really making a run at the ACC championship game. I know Clemson is a machine and seems unstoppable, but these kinds of streaks always come to an end. They might dominate the ACC for another season or two, but there will be some other teams that will catch up. Pitt could be one of them.</p>
