<h1>Toomey measure to crack down on fentanyl imports moves forward in Senate</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Congress has reached a deal to move forward a measure to penalize countries like China for failing to stop shipments into the United States of fentanyl, a powerful painkiller responsible for tens of thousands of overdose deaths,&nbsp;Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deal to include the Blocking Deadly Fentanyl Imports Act to the annual defense spending bill marked a long-sought victory for Mr. Toomey, who has worked for three years to pass the legislation with Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., as a co-sponsor. Mr. Toomey&nbsp;has pressed for a tougher stance on Chinese fentanyl production for years.</p>
<p>“I’ve spent probably more time discussing this crisis with my fellow Pennsylvanians as I’ve traveled around the state as I’ve spent on any other topic I can think of,” Mr. Toomey told reporters.</p>
<p>“While we understandably have been extremely focused on coronavirus and the deaths that have resulted from COVID-19, I don’t want us to lose sight of the appalling consequences of the ravages of the opioid epidemic, which is not over,” he said.</p>
<p>The deal was reached as appetite grows on Capitol Hill to push back on China’s growing geopolitical and economic influence around the world.</p>
<p>Last month, two Pennsylvania freshman congressmen — Reps. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters, and John Joyce, R-Blair — were <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/05/07/Rep-Guy-Reschenthaler-Breitbart-NewsMax-WHO-Trump-China-coronavirus-COVID-19/stories/202005170004?cid=search" target="_blank">selected for a House GOP-led panel </a>&nbsp;tasked with investigating China’s impact supply chains, health care, national security and trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, Mr. Toomey promoted his legislation by teaming up with Mr. Reschenthaler on an <a href="https://www.toomey.senate.gov/?p=news&amp;id=2395" target="_blank">op-ed in the Post-Gazette</a> and at an <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2019/02/19/City-Mission-Washington-Pa-model-opioid-abuse-Toomey-Reschenthaler/stories/201902190106" target="_blank">event at a Washington, Pa., facility</a> treating people who suffer from opioid addiction.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey highlighted the&nbsp;alarming rise in fentanyl overdose deaths as an issue of bipartisan compromise.&nbsp;“Fortunately, in a very, very polarized Congress, fighting this terrible affliction has not been politically polarized," Mr. Toomey said at last year’s Washington, Pa., event.</p>
<p>In 2018, U.S. overdose deaths from fentanyl rose to as many as 28,400, even as overall opioid overdose deaths fell, according to the National Institutes of Health. The synthetic opioid is as much as 50 times more potent than heroin.</p>
<p>That year, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents seized 110 pounds of fentanyl worth an estimated $1.7 million at the Port of Philadelphia. “It’s absolutely devastating and stunning,” Mr. Toomey recalled on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s bill adds fentanyl to a list of substances identified by a 1970 law that penalizes foreign governments that flout U.S. narcotic control efforts. The law currently authorizes U.S. officials to cut off aid to country that enables exports of&nbsp;heroin, marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine.</p>
<p>For the last three years, Mr. Toomey said he and Mr. Jones have held discussions with a “small group” of lawmakers concerned about unintended consequences of withholding U.S. aid and loans backed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States.&nbsp;Mr. Toomey, who has long <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2019/09/22/Import-Export-Bank-China-trade-Trump-Congress-Wabtec-AcousticSheep/stories/201908120001" target="_blank">criticized of the government bank</a> as unnecessary, helps along deals struck between U.S. business deals with foreign countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s fentanyl measure failed to make the cut in last year’s defense bill, passed in December. That bill included the Fentanyl Sanction Act, the first-ever measure that authorizes U.S. sanctions on illicit opioid manufacturers and cartels and the banks that finance them.</p>
<p>This week, Senate agreed to add the bill as an amendment to the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act.</p>
<p>“It’s been one obstacle after another, but the good news is I think that we’ve knocked them all down and I think we’re going to get this over the goal line,”&nbsp;Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>At least one major obstacle remains.</p>
<p>In a late-night tweet on Tuesday, President Donald Trump pledged to veto the defense legislation if&nbsp;it includes provisions, introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to consider renaming Confederate military bases.</p>
<p>“I will Veto the Defense Authorization Bill if the Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) of Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, and many other Military Bases from which we won Two World Wars, is in the Bill!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>Speaking with reporters, Mr. Toomey said he has not read Ms. Warren’s language but that he would consider the idea of renaming bases, pointing out it is the sole responsibility&nbsp;of Congress to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m very sympathetic with the idea that we ought to be taking a look at specifically those significant assets that are named after Confederate figures,” Mr. Toomey said.&nbsp;“Those are, after all, people who chose to go to war against the United States. They were defeated, thankfully.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey said he is hoping the defense bill includes two other measures.</p>
<p>One is his bill that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/05/26/Pat-Toomey-chris-Van-Hollen-call-sanctions-China-banks-Hong-Kong-autonomy/stories/202005260056?cid=search" target="_blank">imposes secondary sanctions on Chinese banks</a> in response to the country’s recent actions to curtail Hong Kong’s independence. The other is a measure forcing the U.S. Army to explain why it has delayed planned upgrades to the Chinook helicopter, upgrades scheduled to be done in part by workers in Delaware County.</p>
