<h1>Falling bond yields reflect worries about the economy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The bond market was flashing red signals long before the stock market began to recognize the consequences of a novel coronavirus disrupting the world economy.</p>
<p>Even as stocks were scaling record highs as recently as mid-February, bond yields were in a free fall that started at the beginning of the year —&nbsp;shortly after the first cases of the COVID-19 disease reported in Wuhan, China.</p>
<p>As the virus spread and fears of the economic impact on businesses around the world began to take hold, investors quickly began to flee stocks and race into the safety of bonds. The dramatic selloff at the end of February led to the worst decline in stock prices since the financial crisis of 2008.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the surge of bond buying also set off a historic decline in the interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>“People have been flooding into higher quality bonds like U.S. Treasury bonds, which is part of the reason why interest rates are coming down so much,” said Dave Leduc, chief investment officer of fixed income investments at Mellon, a subsidiary of BNY Mellon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The yield on a bond is the total amount of money that investors earn by owning it. Yields fall when the demand for bonds causes bond prices to rise, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Investors tend to make a mad dash for super-safe government bonds at times of stress, and the rapidly spreading outbreak has recently put more stress on markets than any event since the advent of the Great Recession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Interest rates are like the stock market,” said David Manges, senior vice president of investment firm Ross, Sinclaire &amp; Associates, Downtown.&nbsp;“When you look at them closely, they tell you a lot about the domestic and world economy.”</p>
<p>There is no telling how low interest rates could potentially plunge if the COVID-19 situation worsens, prompting schools and businesses to shutter and employees to work from home. The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond actually punched through its all-time lowest point last&nbsp; week — below 1% — which is widely interpreted by market analysts as a barometer of rising anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Surprise rate cut</strong></p>
<p>As the stock market struggled to regain its footing following a record one-week decline of about 11% at the end of February, the Federal Reserve made an attempt to boost consumer confidence in stocks by announcing an emergency rate cut to a range of 1%-1.25%.</p>
<p>The move came about two weeks before its regular policy meeting —&nbsp;the first time that’s happened since the panic of 2008.</p>
<p>But the surprise Fed rate cut may have had an unintended effect.</p>
<p>“The Fed overreached on the timing,” said Dan Geller, a behavioral economist based in San Francisco.&nbsp;“They should have waited for the meeting to consider the rate cut. They created panic by doing it this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Also, the remedy of cutting rates is not what the patient needs,” Mr. Geller said.&nbsp;“The problem is fear, not greed. People are afraid of the economic consequences of the coronavirus. Reducing interest rates doesn’t address the fear.”</p>
<p>Yields on the 10-year Treasury bond have dropped since the beginning of the year from about 1.9% to less than 1% this week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, banks and credit unions also have been gradually decreasing their rates on deposits since the beginning of the year in anticipation of the Fed cutting rates at its March 17-18 meeting.</p>
<p>And rates had been falling for some time prior to that.</p>
<p>“The coronavirus situation represents a major interest rate risk to banks and credit unions,” Mr. Geller said.&nbsp;“If the banking industry keeps extending current rates on certificates of deposit for three to five years, these rates may be excessive and can adversely impact the net interest income of financial institutions.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The average rate on a five-year certificate of deposit was 1.25% in June 2019. Now the average rate on a five-year CD has fallen to 0.96%, according to a weekly report published by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</p>
<p>Rates on bank deposits are likely to fall still lower in light of the Fed’s emergency rate cut. The Fed is rumored to be planning yet another cut to the federal funds rate at its regular meeting next week. The federal fund rate applies to banks that lend money to each other overnight.</p>
<p>All other interest rates are based on that key benchmark.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“For companies and individuals, what the Fed did with the emergency rate cut was flood the market with liquidity and make money cheaper,” said Carter Henderson, a portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Green Tree.</p>
<p>”If you want more debt as an individual, the Fed made it easier to get a loan. They are enticing you to borrow from the system.”</p>
<p><strong>The bond reasoning</strong></p>
<p>Bonds have a reputation for being the investment choice for investors who want to avoid risking money in the stock market in favor of keeping their principle safe and receiving a guaranteed return.</p>
<p>People who buy bonds are loaning money for a specified period of time — the maturity date — to a company or government entity. In return, the issuer promises to make regular interest payments to the bondholder and return the original investment amount when the bond matures.</p>
<p>Bond investors should always get the money back with interest — although rates vary.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries are the safest bond investment because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. But bonds also are issued by state and local government and corporations with varying degrees of creditworthiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The riskiest companies pay higher yields due to the higher risk involved with owning their bonds.</p>
<p>“There are lots of different interest rates that trade in different markets,” Mr. Manges said.&nbsp;“Sometimes they move in unison. Sometimes they don’t. The rate paid on checking and savings accounts have been close to zero for years, and that won’t change. Credit card rates won’t move much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Car loans are going for about 4% these days. Those may go down, but not to 0%, which is what the government pays,” he said. “Fortune 500 companies will see their borrowing rates go down, but small businesses may not see the same benefit.”</p>
