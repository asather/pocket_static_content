<h1>In South Carolina, Democratic candidates stop by Baptist church to court black voters </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — Joe Biden took the stage on Wednesday before a majority-black audience in the gymnasium of a Baptist church, pointing to his efforts as vice president to pass the Affordable Care Act and send federal stimulus dollars into this community.</p>
<p>The depth of Mr. Biden’s relationship with black voters — which helped propel him to a now-shrinking lead in South Carolina — emerged most clearly in a reference to his White House work with the nation’s first black president, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>“I call him Barack because I don’t want to confuse him with a president,” Mr. Biden said. “He’s a friend.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, who has said he’s staking his primary campaign on winning the Palmetto State in Saturday’s election, sought to portray himself as the best shot at restoring compassion, faith and stability to the Oval Office.</p>
<p>“A lot of folks talk the talk,” Mr. Biden said. “Few people walk the walk.”</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Biden was not alone at the South Carolina Ministers’ Breakfast, where about 150 people munched on eggs, hash browns, sausage, biscuits and gravy at tables set up in the church gymnasium.</p>
<p>He was followed by five other top Democratic candidates — all white — who were each allowed 10 to 15 minutes to present their vision for defeating President Donald Trump in November.</p>
<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leading the race after three states, closed out the event by talking about his lifelong work on civil rights activism. He recalled his arrest protesting school segregation in Chicago in the 1960s and his affinity for Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>He said his social and economic policies, including guaranteed health care, would close disparities between white and black communities.</p>
<p>“I think that maybe we need government policies that protect working families and not just billionaires,” Mr. Sanders said. He included a promise: “We’re going to end every form of racism that exists in this country.”</p>
<p>The event, organized by the National Action Network, an advocacy group led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, came hours after Tuesday’s debate in Charleston.</p>
<p>While the candidates had spent two prime-time hours attacking one another, they mostly united on Wednesday to take aim at Mr. Trump. They spoke of raising the minimum wage, investing in affordable housing, reining in big Wall Street banks, fighting climate change and reforming the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>“Despite the slugfest that can go on there, there’s so much more that united us than divides us,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., referring to the debate.&nbsp;“Actually getting this done is what’s going to matter.”</p>
<p>Pete Buttigieg acknowledged he had made mistakes as mayor of South Bend, Ind., but that he leaned on black advisers to turn around his mid-sized city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I will never know what it’s like walking down the street to feel eyes on me, assessing me, believing me to be dangerous ... just because the color of my skin,” Mr. Buttigieg said.&nbsp;“The next-best thing I can do is listen to people who have” experienced such prejudice.</p>
<p>Tom Steyer, the hedge-fund billionaire who has traveled to South Carolina more than any other presidential candidate, said he would support reparations for slavery and impose term limits to encourage the election of “younger people, blacker people, browner people, more female people.”</p>
<p>“We have to tell the story of what’s happened over the last 400 years,” Mr. Steyer said. “We are very far from racial justice in the United States of America. We don’t address race as a policy area.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders had sharp words for the current president. He called Mr. Trump a “racist” who had falsely questioned the American citizenship of Mr. Obama to “delegitimize” the black president.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump “is a sexist, he is a homophobe, he is a xenophobe, he is a religious bigot,” Mr. Sanders went on. “That is not the type of person we want in the White House.”</p>
<p>People filing out of&nbsp;Mt. Moriah Missionary Baptist Church, a 130-year-old institution set among strip malls in North Charleston, had mixed reactions to the speech. Many said they had heard the same promises before and wanted to see action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some said they were somewhat put off by the speeches.</p>
<p>“I know this is a majority black group, but we’re in this country together,” said Wilma Mitchell, of West Ashley, S.C.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Of course we have been done wrong over the years, and racism is still alive and well,” Ms. Mitchell added. “But all these candidates’ promises — who’s going to move us forward?”</p>
<p>The Rev. DeMett Jenkins, of Charleston<strong>,</strong> said Mr. Buttigieg was her top choice, and the breakfast was a chance to see who might be best as a running mate, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t hear him making these far-fetched promises that makes me feel good in the moment, yet, in actuality, can’t happen,” she said.&nbsp;“To make promises that you really don’t know if you can uphold, that’s not what I’m trying to hear.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders’ promise to end all racism, she added,&nbsp;“is not real to me.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sharpton, speaking at the start of the breakfast, alluded to the candidates’ debate over their progressive credentials — and how that can ring hollow to many black voters.</p>
<p>“ ‘Progressive’ is such a loose term now that everybody is progressive,” Mr. Sharpton said. “Many people are progressive on everything but race. They have every agenda but a black agenda.”</p>
<p>While Mr. Sharpton spoke highly of all the candidates, he emphasized his long, personal relationships with Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden “was always open and he would always tell me how he really felt,”&nbsp;said Mr. Sharpton, an influential leader in the black community who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. “And he listened to what we felt.”</p>
<p>Of Mr. Sanders, Mr. Sharpton said the two have&nbsp;“talked about issues for years.” He reminded the audience that the “socialist” label has been used pejoratively throughout history to repress real change in the country.</p>
<p>“Many people thought Bernie Sanders and frontrunner would never be in the same sentence,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
