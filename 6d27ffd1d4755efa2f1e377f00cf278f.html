<p>The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority on Friday extended its moratorium on service shutoffs until July 1 and eased requirements for financial assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We recognize that access to clean water for sanitation and proper hygiene plays a critical role in keeping our community safe and healthy. The Board’s actions today make it clear that we will not discontinue water service during this extended period of uncertainty and economic hardship,” Paul Leger, PWSA board chair, said in a press release.</p>
<p>The authority’s moratorium extends beyond the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/13/PWSA-shut-off-moratorium-COVID-19-water-income-sewer/stories/202003130133" target="_blank">previous date of May 31</a>.</p>
<p>The board also lifted two requirements through the end of 2020 for customers seeking financial assistance: one, they will no longer be required to rectify their income every 12 months with the Dollar Energy Fund, and secondly, customers will not be required to make&nbsp;“sincere effort payments” — in the amount of $150, or $75 for seniors — before receiving cash assistance grants.</p>
<p>Customer seeking assistance should call&nbsp;866-762-2348 or visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pgh2o.com/residential-commercial-customers/billing-community-assistance-programs/customer-assistance-programs" target="_blank">www.pgh2o.com/residential-commercial-customers/billing-community-assistance-programs/customer-assistance-programs</a>.</p>
