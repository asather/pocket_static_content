<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 02.06.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Good afternoon, welcome to the chat and lets get rolling! Im sorry I am a little late, i was at Madonna’s house trying to get my Bentley back.....</p>
<p><strong>Mel</strong>: With Troy's election into HOF any thoughts on who might he chose to present him. I know there has been a separation between the steelers and Troy and just thinking which way he was thinking <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It wouldnt shock me if it was Dick LeBeau. He had a great relationship with him, respects him tremendously. It would make a lot of sense</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: HI PAUL.... Great name sir!!! When Colbert said they would not sigh a veteran QB in FA was that all a smokescreen or do you think they are really fine with Ben's rehab status AND Mason as a viable backup??? Cause I have doubts about Mason TBH I know salary wise we probably can't sign a top or mid tier FA QB but there has to be a plan in place. Is Ben coming back guns a blazing??? lol WHAT SAY YOU???. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I do not think it is a smoke screen. He seems to be dealing in reality. They cannot afford to sign a veteran QB who is any good. For better or worse, the Steelers have hitdhed their wagons to Ben and Ben getting back healthy.</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Hi Paul. So we Tag Dupree and keep the defense intact. Do you see Hargrave as an important cog in the wheel as well. What % in terms of importance do you place on the Steelers resigning him. I put it at at least 50-60%. And what grade did you give Barron on his play last season? Is he coming back you think??? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think Barron deserves a C. He didnt do anything special but did not do anythint to kill the Steelers. He could be cut to save a lot of money under the salary cap. I put a very high percentage on Hargrave being back. They think he is an important cog in their defense and he wont cost them a ton of money.</p>
<p><strong>retguy18</strong>: Paul...I have some real reservations about Narduzzi, yet I think his leaving would have hurt more than helped given the timing and hopes for next year. What are your thoughts on him? Can he get Pitt past the place its been for most of the last 40 years? <br> <strong>Retire21</strong>: Your take on Narduzzi? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think Pitt fans should be happy that he isnt going to entertain taking the MSU job. I think he has not won quite as many games as he should have so i understand why some Pitt fans get anxious about the future. Here is the thing he has built the program, built the talent base up. They are on the verge of becoming an annual top 20 team. He has a good team coming back, a favorable schedule - to start over now would be terrible for the program. Ill say it again: it has been a decade since they fired Dave Wannstedt and the profram still has not recovered fully. Narduzzi finally has the program on the verge of some great things, i believe. Stability is something Pitt FB fans should want.</p>
<p><strong>clyde567</strong>: Regarding the Penguins. Given their recent success this season, do you feel the Penguins have the necessary players to take it to the Stanley Cup? Or do you think they are missing a piece (or two) to get them there? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They beat the Bruins and the Caps in the last two weeks. They have proven they can beat anyone out there if they play their game. Now that doesnt mean they couldnt improve. I expect Rutherford to go get a winger to try and enhance the offense</p>
<p><strong>Johny</strong>: Paul, to much have been said About Finney being a good backup guard and center, if you ask me I will say that everytime I saw him in at guard, I always like him better than Foster with all due respect .. he must be a keeper this offseason.. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I agree and wont be shocked if is a starter at guard this season.</p>
<p><strong>Betty</strong>: Paul, sorry to tell you this: but Hines Ward should be a hall if famer which ever way you or anybody see it.. Enough stats, effort, dedication, blocking, smarts, non passing team early in career if not all his career .. much better receiver than many already in.. enough said.. you should change your point of view! Any comments? Thanks <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: We can agree to disagree, respectfully of course.....</p>
<p><strong>FoolBack</strong>: Hi Paul, because the Pirates payroll is below $50M, should we be expecting some last minute, moderately priced signings, or will the Pirates stand pat? I'm not for spending to just spend, but this seems low for even for the Pirates? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I do not expect them to spend more money. I do not expect them to add. I think what they will do is try and get through this season and build for down the road. They have made this clear with their actions, actually</p>
<p><strong>Arthur</strong>: Hey Paul...since WR Cain played well last season, do you think Switzer is gone? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think Ryan Switzer probably has played his last game with the Steelers. I dont think it is because of Deon Cain, I think it is because of Diontae Johnson. Switzer was the punt returner. Johnson is much better. I know Switzer is Ben’s buddy but that wont be enough. He just isnt good enough</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Personally, I am tired of the Pirates, even their new management team, crying wolf, also known as the small market blues. How naïve do they think fans are with their salary dumbs (Marte), their promise to redistribute the savings when the time and team is right and their refusal to acknowledge a re-build? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well i dont completely disagree - but i have to give the benefit of the doubt here. I hope the owner has turned over a new leaf and will do things differently but I suppose only time will tell <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Any more questions??? Where is everyone at!</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: How sincere should we consider A.B.'s comments on the Fan this morning or is this just a PR move set up by his representatives? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think the guy is full of shhhh.... the brown stuff to be frank. He never once took responsibility for his actions. He blamed everyone else, he flat out lied about his role in some of it and just doesnt seem to get it. Someone will give him a chance though and his enablers will still make excuses for him. He is a guy who needs help and anyone who buys this “image rehab” garbage is naive and not using their brain.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Are the Pirates done with their non-rebuilding for this year or should we expect more salary dumps, sorry, trades before opening day? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No, I think they are done cutting.....until the trade deadline. At that point all bets are off. It wont shock me if they dump anyone and everyone who teams inquire about. But indo think they are done for now.</p>
<p><strong>Hail to Pitt</strong>: Paul, do you think State College media cover Pitt the way their respective teams are covered im Pittsburgh? It seems State Penn and WVU get more local attention than Duquesne snd Bobby Mo. Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Sigh. I think it is totally irrelevant and one of the dumbest complaints among Pitt fans. This is a large media market, there are lots of fans of WVU and PSU here. We cover Pitt more than every other college program COMBINED. And it isnt close, either. A lot of PSU fans live here and they are the states team. Pitt is a regional team within the state and State College is a local yocal market and the only team in town there is PSU. They are a much smaller and more defined audience than we have here in Pgh. This is apples and oranges</p>
<p><strong>Krugerrand</strong>: What does your crystal ball say will happen with the NFL labor negotiations? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The owners will win like they always do</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Like most Steeler fans, I am hopeful that Ben can come back this year (if not we are in trouble) but the reality is that he only has a few more years at best in him. Once gone, it could be quite a while before we see another Super Bowl. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I dont know how much he has left. You look at Eli and Phil Rivers and you wonder if Ben has decned just like they have. They are all three the same age.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Did you think the Marte trade was a salary dump? All you have to do is look at the trade from the other side. Arizona fans are thinking that they got a 5 tool all star caliber centerfielder for a couple teenage propspects who may not make it past AAA. Marte's salary was only high around these parts. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It was a salary dump. It was a trade to try and get prospects into the system. It can be and was both. Marte is a good player who couldnt stay healthy. His market was not what some fans wanted it to be</p>
<p><strong>Diego</strong>: Are there any players in the upcoming draft that you would love to see the Steelers draft in Round 2? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes but unfortunately They will all be gone. Ha ha. I think if they get the best offensive lineman or tight end On the board when they pick it will be a good draft</p>
<p><strong>Gideon</strong>: How can the Steelers be considered a contender for he nextSuperbowl? They weren't great before Ben's injury going back to the previous season. The offense seems to be more than just a better QB away from being able to keep up with teams like KC or SF. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I agree and was ripped for being Mr Doom and Gloom for dealing in reality. Ill say it again.... the QB is 38 and coming off major surgery. The RB is injury prone. The star WR has never been that without AB on the other side. The TE position stinks. The Oline struggled this year and now will be a year older. Remind me again why im aupposed to buy this team is capable of going toe to toe with the Chiefs?</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: Will small and mid market baseball ever tell the New York, Chicago, LA, ESPN poster boys that the field has to be leveled? I still despise Boston for the hissy fit they threw, but Pittsburgh owner ship should have told them where to get off <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They wont because everyone is getting rich and making money hand over fist. There is no incentive for smaller market owners to change the formula now</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: The problem with the Marte trade (salary dump) is that they are going to need A LOT more than those two kids to re-stock the Pirates' farm system. My question: Where are all of those star prospects that the Pirates assured us that they were developing over the years because they could not afford quality free agents? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think the fact that many of them havent become players is one of many reasons Neal Huntington and company are no longer here!</p>
<p><strong>Peter</strong>: I had to laugh when I saw the reaction of Bo Sox fans to losing Mookie....Now they know how Pirates’ fans feel. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The Red Sox dumping salary is ridiculous. They have no excuse for it. But it has been fun watching Boston fans whining. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well thats it and thanks for all the great questions, lets do it again next week!!!</p>
