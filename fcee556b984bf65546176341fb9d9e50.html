<h1>Full disclosure: Names of nursing homes with COVID-19 cases to be publicized </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The names of nursing homes with cases of COVID-19 will soon be publicly disclosed, thanks to a new order from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>CMS on Monday said it would require nursing homes to inform residents, families and their representatives of COVID-19 cases and CMS plans to make that information publicly available. Moreover, nursing homes will be required to report COVID-19 cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to aid in the agency’s surveillance of the highly contagious disease.</p>
<p>“Nursing home reporting to the CDC is a critical component of the go-forward national COVID-19 surveillance system and to efforts to reopen America, CMS Administrator Seema Verma said in a statement.</p>
<p>The new requirements will go into effect “very soon,” according to CMS.</p>
<p>Skilled nursing facilities and personal care homes have become hot spots for the new coronavirus, with many facilities reporting illness and death caused by the highly infectious disease. But facility operators have not been required to publicly disclose COVID-19 cases and some have opted not to while others, including Oakmont-based Presbyterian SeniorCare Network, have adopted a full public disclosure policy.</p>
