<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For a fourth straight day, Allegheny County on Friday reported a triple-digit increase in new daily COVID-19 cases, with 177 more infections. Those were among a spike of 667 new diagnoses reported statewide.</p>
<p>The new data come a day after Allegheny County hit a record 233 daily cases -— the first time new positive cases had eclipsed the 200 mark.&nbsp;Since the county reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 14, it has had a total of 3,280 cases.</p>
<p>There was no change in the county’s death toll, which remains at 187. Pennsylvania’s health department is reporting 188 deaths for the county.</p>
<p>There’s been an upswing in newly reported cases for the past two weeks. County health officials said the percentage of positive coronavirus tests has now doubled to 10% from a week ago.</p>
<p>To contain the surge in infections, county health officials <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/02/COVID-19-coronavirus-Allegheny-County-Western-Pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-200/stories/202007020115" target="_blank">on Thursday ordered all bars, restaurants and casinos closed</a> for a week starting Friday.</p>
<p>Eateries are allowed to continue take-out and delivery services during the week-long shutdown.</p>
<p>Gatherings of more than 25 people during that period also will be prohibited. Health director Dr. Debra Bogen recommended that residents stay at home to prevent transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>In another effort to slow down the rise in cases, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/01/pa-masks-required-anyone-who-leaves-home-covid-19-cases-increase-pennsylvania/stories/202007010145" target="_blank">state made mask wearing a requirement</a> anytime someone leaves their house, rather than just inside businesses.</p>
<p>Data released by Allegheny County also shows that there were five additional hospitalizations, bringing the total number to 406.&nbsp;Newly infected individuals in the county ranged in age from 1 to 90 years, with the median age of 28.</p>
<p>In the 20-county region of Western Pennsylvania, between Erie and Fayette counties, there was an increase of 296 cases of the highly infectious virus. The region’s second-highest daily increase was Westmoreland County, which reported 33 new cases.</p>
