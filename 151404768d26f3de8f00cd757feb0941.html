<p>U.S. House Representative Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters, is in self-quarantine at his home in Peters Township after he came in close contact with another congressman who tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>In a written statement to the Post-Gazette Wednesday night, Mr. Reschenthaler said he came in close contact Tuesday with Congressman Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, who tested positive for COVID-19 Wednesday.</p>

<p>During Tuesday’s House Judiciary Committee hearing, Mr. Reschenthaler said he shared a desk, had “extensive conversations” and walked with Mr. Gohmert from the Capitol building to the Cannon House Office Building.</p>
<p>“After a personal consultation with the Attending Physician and in accordance with their guidance, I will be self-quarantining for 14 days out of an abundance of caution,” Mr.&nbsp;Reschenthaler said.</p>
<p>After Mr. Gohmert tested positive for COVID-19, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on the House floor Wednesday evening that all members of the House of Representatives will be required to wear a mask and one will be provided if they forget, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Mr. Reschenthaler — who represents Pennsylvania’s 14th Congressional District, which covers all of Washington Fayette and Greene counties and part of Westmoreland — told KDKA that he was among several members who came in close contact with Mr. Gohmert.</p>
