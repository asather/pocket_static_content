<h1>Monks voting on new archabbot for St. Vincent</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Benedictine monks at St. Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe are meeting Tuesday to elect the first new leader in nearly three decades at one of the world’s largest Roman Catholic monasteries.</p>
<p>The monks began convening Monday evening for a Mass and were scheduled to hold three sessions on Tuesday to elect a successor to Archabbot Douglas Nowicki. If needed, more sessions will be held Wednesday.</p>
<p>Archabbot Nowicki resigned on May 8 after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75. He has led the archabbey since he was first elected in 1991, and he was re-elected in 2010. Before becoming archabbot, the Everson, Pa., native was secretary for education of the Diocese of Pittsburgh from 1986 to 1991 and pastor of Our Lady, Queen of Peace Parish on Pittsburgh’s North Side from 1984 to 1986. He also taught at St. Vincent College.</p>
<p>The archabbey was founded in 1846. Its members include priests and brothers, many of whom serve at parishes and schools throughout the region.</p>
