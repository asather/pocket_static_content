<h1>Dominik Kahun on the Penguins trading him to Buffalo: 'I didn't really see it coming'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the second time in less than a year, Dominik Kahun got dealt Monday. And, just like he was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/06/17/Pittsburgh-Penguins-Dominik-Kahun-Olli-Maatta-trade-Chicago-Blackhawks-Sidney-Crosby/stories/201906170095" target="_blank">when the Penguins got him from the Chicago Blackhawks</a> last June, the winger was stunned Monday to learn he was on the move again.</p>
<p>The Penguins <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/24/pittsburgh-penguins-patrick-marleau-san-jose-sharks-trade-deadline/stories/202002240076" target="_blank">traded Kahun to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Conor Sheary</a>, a key role player on their two recent Stanley Cup teams, and Evan Rodrigues.</p>
<p>“When I got traded [Monday], first of all, it was a shock, for sure. I didn’t really see it coming,” the soft-spoken Kahun said Tuesday on a conference call organized by the Sabres. “But I’m really, really happy to play for Buffalo now.”</p>
<p>His inclusion in a trade was indeed a tad surprising. He just last week returned from a month-long absence due to a concussion. And while <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/11/17/Dominik-Kahun-Pittsburgh-Penguins-Chicago-Blackhawks-Olli-Maatta-trade/stories/201911170196" target="_blank">he was still trying to fit in with his new team</a> and secure a spot on one of the top two lines, he did have 10 goals and 27 points in 50 games with Pittsburgh prior to the trade.</p>
<p>Kahun in his brief time with the organization showed that he had playmaking ability and decent wheels. And he didn’t seem to make many mistakes. But he also wasn’t necessarily a player who grabbed your eye. You might glance at the box score after a game and wonder, “Wait, Kahun had two points tonight?”</p>
<p>The Penguins were obviously not convinced that Kahun would be a good fit on a line with either Sidney Crosby or Evgeni Malkin during their playoff push.</p>
<p>The Blackhawks were willing to move on him from him, too, even though he had produced solid numbers as a rookie playing with some of their top players.</p>
<p>So, it’s probably understandable that the 24-year-old is surprised and perhaps a little puzzled that he has already been traded twice in his first two NHL seasons despite putting up 23 goals, 64 points and a plus-16 rating in 132 games.</p>
<p>“That’s something that is out of my control. I play hockey. That’s what I do best. It doesn’t matter where I play. I always try to help and be the best,” he said. “I was a little surprised but I’m very excited. I hope that I can stay longer in Buffalo.”</p>
<p>That said, he was polite when asked about his experience with the Penguins.</p>
<p>“It’s a great team with, obviously, very good players,” he said. “So I could learn from them. I learned new stuff. They definitely made me better and stronger.”</p>
