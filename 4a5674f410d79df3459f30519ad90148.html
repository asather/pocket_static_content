<p>“Barefoot: The Mark Baumer Story” won best documentary at the Omaha Film Festival last weekend. The film by Pittsburgh filmmaker Julie Sokolow played at the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2019/11/12/Barefoot-The-Mark-Baumer-Story-Three-Rivers-Film-Festival-Julie-Sokolow/stories/201911070191" target="_blank">Three Rivers Film Festival</a> last November, and had previously won for best documentary premiere at Indianapolis’ Heartland Film Festival. It also was an&nbsp;“Inspiration Award” winner at the Cinema on the Bayou festival in Lafayette, La.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s been incredibly moving to see audiences respond to ‘Barefoot,’” Sokolow said.</p>
<p>“It feels like we’re continuing Mark’s journey, in a way. With the film, we’re traveling the country, talking to people about climate change. The film really is about how one person can make a difference. So if a single audience member is inspired, we’ve succeeded.”</p>
<p>Maine native Baumer was 33 when he was struck and killed by a woman driving an SUV in Florida in 2017. He was 100 days into walking barefoot across America to raise $10,000 and awareness in the name of Fighting Against Natural Gas (FANG).</p>
<p>The film underscores Baumer’s passion for the beauty of the earth he walked. Recently, it received a favorable <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/barefoot-mark-baumer-story-1282527?fbclid=IwAR3XVUs1C6j6olQMt101vZ5a0gvMYp4ZuPVAXlbv28LElrBXmerX7jS9Vm0" target="_blank">review</a> in The Hollywood Reporter, calling it a&nbsp;“clear-eyed documentary.”</p>
<p>Sokolow said she was to exhibit&nbsp;“Barefoot” at the Cinequest Film Festival in San Jose, Calif. this week, but due to concerns over Covid-19, the festival has postponed until its summer event in August.</p>
<p>Similarly,&nbsp;“Barefoot” will not play at the DC Environmental Film Festival, due to health concerns. Reportedly, it might still hold a&nbsp;“virtual” festival.</p>
