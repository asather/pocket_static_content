<h1>With major work at Ohiopyle finished, debate over the value of the project continues</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Although the contractor still has another month of finishing and cleanup work to do, all roads and amenities are open at Ohiopyle State Park after two years of mostly fall and winter construction.</p>
<p>But whether the $12.4 million project to widen Route 381, install a pedestrian tunnel under the road and move the bike trail away from the roadside resulted in a safer, more accessible park depends on who’s doing the talking.</p>
<p>Plum Contracting Inc. completed the road and trail work July 2, more than five weeks after the promised completion before Memorial Day because of six weeks of delays attributed to railroad work under the Route 381 bridge and the statewide shutdown of construction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The contractor still has about a month’s worth of work left to remove equipment from a staging area and complete a routine punch list of items that officials from the state Department of Transportation and park officials say are deficient.</p>
<p>“Our major concern was to get the roadway and bridge open for July 4 and they were done on [July 2],” said Jay&nbsp;Ofsanik, spokesman for PennDOT’s District 12. Most of the remaining work can be done in off-peak hours or without disrupting traffic at the hiking and river recreation area that draws about 1.5 million visitors a year.</p>
<p>The only major part of the project that remains is installation of a new bath house for boaters to change clothes. That facility, which is in the revamped parking lot across from the visitor center, is scheduled to be erected by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources after the busy season is over in the fall.</p>
<p>Ken Bisbee, operations manager at the park for the state, said business at the park&nbsp;“has been really good.” Visitors headed for rafting or kayaking on the Youghiogheny River have quickly taken to using the pedestrian tunnel, designed to eliminate many near-miss collisions between motorists and boaters crossing the highway.</p>
<p>“It’s the most convenient way for people who use that parking lot, so they are using it,” he said.</p>
<p>Many residents and businesses weren’t happy about the project before it started, calling it an unnecessary disruption aimed at a situation that they didn’t believe was a major safety problem. With the work mostly completed, some haven’t changed that opinion.</p>
<p>Eric Martin, CEO of Wilderness Voyageurs, minces few words discussing the project. Other than refurbishing the bridge, which he said had to be done, he refers to the rest of the work as&nbsp;“ridiculous,” “utterly ludicrous” and&nbsp;“an incredible mess.”</p>
<p>In Mr. Martin’s view, paving, enlarging and formalizing the parking lots across from the visitor center took away the charm of the area and eliminated green space.</p>
<p>“They replaced a bunch of green space with asphalt,” he said.&nbsp;“It looks like an interstate interchange.”</p>
<p>Mr. Martin said he also doesn’t see any net safety improvements. The pedestrian tunnel may take some boaters off the road, he said, but that is negated by narrower sidewalks on the river side of Route 381 that make it hard for people carrying boats to pass one another and by the walkway along the bridge not having any physical barrier from traffic.</p>
<p>“I don’t see a safety gain. I see a safety loss,” he said.&nbsp;“I feel any safety improvement from the tunnel was negated by the walkway on the bridge.”</p>
<p>Mr. Martin also claims crews doing bridge work were&nbsp;“sloppy” and dropped several metal pieces in the river under it. He distributed photos of items he said he has found since October at the popular swimming area.</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Ofsanik said that is one situation crews will check as part of punch-list work.</p>
<p>Despite the late finish of construction, Mr. Bisbee said his department is happy with the project and the park is enjoying a busier-than-normal season. That’s probably due to increased outdoor activity and regional travel during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“The parking lot is full on a Wednesday afternoon,” he said.&nbsp;“It’s nice to see so many people enjoying the park during the COVID crisis.”</p>
