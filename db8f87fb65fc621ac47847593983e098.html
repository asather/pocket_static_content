<h1>2020 Masters postponed due to COVID-19 concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Golf’s first major tournament of the season was postponed indefinitely Friday.</p>
<p>The Masters will be postponed, according to an announcement Friday from officials at the Augusta National Golf Club, the hosts of the event.</p>
<p>Thursday night, the PGA Tour, which conducts the bulk of the professional golf events in North America, announced it was canceling several tournaments and suspending operations until the week of the Masters, which is scheduled for April 9 to 12.</p>
<p>“We hope this postponement puts us in the best position to safely host the Masters Tournament and our amateur events at some later date,” tournament organizers said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Masters is the first golf major championship of the year and has been played every year since 1934, except from 1943 to 1945 when it was canceled because of World War II.</p>
<p>Tiger Woods, in one of the most memorable sporting events of 2019, came from behind to win last year’s Masters. It was Woods’s 15th major championship. Woods has been sidelined in recent weeks resting his surgically repaired back.</p>
<p>After initially announcing that the Players Championship in Florida, another of its most important events, would proceed without fans, the PGA Tour decided late Thursday to cancel it, as well as its next three events in Florida and Texas. An event in the Dominican Republic had been canceled earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Earlier Thursday, PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan had said that since golf is an outdoor sport played in a vast expanse — the TPC-Sawgrass golf course where the Players Championship was being hosted is more than 400 acres — it made for “a safe environment.”</p>
<p>The LPGA had previously announced the postponement of three events in the U.S., having previously canceled two Asian events.</p>
