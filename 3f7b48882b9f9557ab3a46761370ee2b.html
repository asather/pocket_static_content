<p>Matt Murray is thanking Pittsburgh police officers with the gift of pastrami.</p>
<p>Yeah, you’re probably going to need a little more context here. The Penguins announced Thursday that the two-time Cup-winning goalie is partnering with Primanti Bros. to launch a $5,000 open tab for hungry police officers.</p>
<p>Beginning today, Murray and Primanti Bros. will offer police access at its Market Square location. The restaurant chain is currently only offering takeout service, but orders may be placed by calling ahead or in person at the restaurant. Officers should be present and show a badge to access the goalie’s tab.</p>
<p>“I want to thank the people on the front lines who put themselves at risk every day to keep us safe,” the 25-year-old said Thursday in a statement.</p>
