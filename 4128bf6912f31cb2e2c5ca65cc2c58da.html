<h1>New Pitt-based study shows sepsis kills twice as many people globally as thought</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The number of people who become ill or die from sepsis across the globe is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26414292" target="_blank">more than double previous estimates</a>, and one out of five people around the world die from sepsis every year, <a href="https://marlin-prod.literatumonline.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/PIIS0140673619329897.pdf" target="_blank">according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Lancet</a> led by a University of Pittsburgh researcher.</p>
<p>Overall there were an estimated 48.9 million sepsis cases and 11 million sepsis-related deaths in 2017, the most recent year that the study covered.</p>
<p>In some poor countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, more than 50% of deaths are related to sepsis, the body’s overwhelming immune response to infection, which can cause organ and tissue failure, according to the study led by University of Pittsburgh sepsis expert Dr. Kristina Rudd.</p>
<p>Sepsis experts hope the finding will serve as a “wake-up” call to the global health community, which had long underappreciated sepsis’ impact on worldwide health and mortality.</p>
<p>“I think this is a call to action really,” said Dr. Adrienne Randolph, a professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School and a member of the International Sepsis Forum’s council. “I hope it influences funders to change some of their funding choices.”</p>
<p><strong>New study most accurate ever</strong></p>
<p>Thursday’s study is believed by experts to be the most accurate estimate ever made of the impact of sepsis. That is thanks to new data that allowed Dr. Rudd and her co-authors to more accurately calculate incidents and deaths in low-income countries.</p>
<p>In low-income countries in Africa and Asia, it was long hypothesized that there were higher rates of sepsis than wealthier places like North America and Western Europe. But many countries in Africa and Asia don’t have as rigorous a set of hospital data.</p>
<p>So Dr. Rudd and her colleagues instead gathered data on 109 million death certificates from around the globe to extrapolate which deaths would be related to sepsis —&nbsp;even if sepsis was not specifically named —&nbsp;and to estimate the number of overall incidents.</p>
<p>“The majority of the reason for the more accurate count is we are now including data from almost every country in the world,” said Dr. Rudd before she left for a conference in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where she would for the first time publicly discuss the study’s findings to other sepsis experts on Thursday.</p>
<p>“The data we used came from the Global Burden of Disease study,” said Dr. Rudd, who is a critical care medicine assistant professor at Pitt. “But we also added our knowledge of sepsis and critical card, and epidemiological expertise.”</p>
<p>The push to do the study, which took more than three years, came from Dr. Rudd and her colleagues’ own personal experiences working in low-income countries.</p>
<p>“I’ve worked in sub-Saharan Africa and I had witnessed the large number of deaths from sepsis,” she said. “And a lot of my colleagues who worked in low socio-demographic index countries had seen it, too.”</p>
<p>Using data going back to 1990, the study did find that globally fewer people are contracting and dying from sepsis. The study estimated that in 1990, 60.2 million people contracted sepsis — a figure that fell 18.8% in 2017 to a still-staggering 48.9 million cases.</p>
<p>There was an even larger percentage drop in sepsis-related deaths, which fell 29.7% from 15.7 million people in 1990 to 11 million in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Fewer deaths since 1990</strong></p>
<p>While finding that sepsis cases have fallen over the last 30 years was hopeful, one of the co-authors said the current numbers show there is still much work to do.</p>
<p>“It is quite sad, when one thinks about it, that sepsis —&nbsp;one of the world’s oldest diseases,&nbsp;described by Hippocrates —&nbsp;is still one of the single biggest killers on the planet, despite all the advances of medicine,” said Dr. Derek Angus, professor and chairman of critical care medicine at Pitt.</p>
<p>“And, given worldwide threats about the rise of anti-microbial resistance, I think these data underscore that sepsis prevention and treatment probably needs far greater attention.”</p>
<p>Dr. Randolph agreed.</p>
<p>“This [new study] to me hopefully will trigger a really intensive effort at understanding the epidemiology and best ways to prevent and treat sepsis around the world,” she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Hallie Prescott, a sepsis expert from the University of Michigan who was not involved in the new study, said the regional disparities demonstrated also point to a need to study what will work to prevent and treat sepsis in different countries.</p>
<p>“We know that certain approaches don’t work everywhere,” said Dr. Prescott, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care. “They have tried fluid boluses in Africa [to help children recover from shock, including sepsis] and they found that it may actually have harmed the patients.”</p>
<p>Part of the reason that fluid bolus treatment, or fluid resuscitation, may not have worked in hospitals in Kenya and Tanzania, where <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1101549" target="_blank">the 2011 study was conducted</a>, she said, was because if there are problems with the patients, “here [in the U.S.] we have the resources to treat them, but there those resources may not be available.”</p>
<p>The new study demonstrated the starkly different sepsis incident and death rates across the globe. It generally shows lower rates in North America and Western Europe “that is the flip opposite of where the burden of disease is” in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, she said.</p>
<p><strong>Solutions don’t work everywhere</strong></p>
<p>Ciaran Stauton said places like the United States still have much higher incidents and deaths from sepsis than they should.</p>
<p>“We need to start at our own door,” said Mr. Staunton, who is founder, with his wife, Orlaith, of the New York-based Rory Staunton Foundation, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2018/07/24/sepsis-regulations-septic-shock-pitt-university-of-pittsburgh-rory-staunton-foundation/stories/201807240099" target="_blank">dedicated to their 12-year-old son </a>who died from sepsis in 2012. “First-world countries need to get their act together before they go telling other countries what to do.”</p>
<p>Mr. Staunton said that estimates of the number of annual sepsis-related deaths in the United States range from as low as 179,000 to upwards of 500,000 per year. The new study by Dr. Rudd and her colleagues estimated there were 189,000 deaths in the United States in 2017.</p>
<p>Sepsis “needs to be raised to the top levels of governments’ attention —&nbsp;including our own,” he said.</p>
<p>He points out that in the couple’s eight years of advocacy, they have already seen changes in the United States, including that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sepsis/index.html" target="_blank">added a full page to its website on sepsis</a>, something it did not have in 2012 when they first looked.</p>
<p>But now, with a better grasp of the worldwide impact of sepsis, he said: “I hope it finally gets the attention it deserves. It’s a wake-up call.”</p>
