<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Wednesday announced the investment of $66 million for 11 drinking water, wastewater and stormwater projects across nine counties through the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST).</p>
<p>“Ensuring that Pennsylvania’s citizens have access to safe and secure infrastructure is a fundamental responsibility of government,” Wolf said in a press release.</p>
<p>The funding for these projects originates from a combination of state funds approved by voters, Growing Greener, Marcellus Legacy funds, federal grants to PENNVEST from the Environmental Protection Agency and recycled loan repayments from previous PENNVEST funding awards, according to the release. Funds for these projects are disbursed after expenses for work are paid and receipts are submitted to PENNVEST for review.</p>
<p>A list of project summaries follows, per the news release:</p>
<p><strong>Bedford County</strong></p>
<p>Bedford Township Municipal Authority – received a $5,223,140 loan to replace 8,500 feet of existing waterline and connect new service with 10,150 feet of additional water line, while also replacing the finished water storage tank. The project will increase reliability by eliminating water service interruptions and ensuring stable connections to underserved communities in the service area.</p>
<p><strong>Berks County</strong></p>
<p>Fleetwood Borough – received a $3,500,000 loan to replace approximately 8,250 feet of ductile iron and cement-lined piping. The project will replace service lines that are at the end of useful life and increase reliability for nearly 1,800 residents.</p>
<p><strong>Mifflin County</strong></p>
<p>Allensville Municipal Authority – received a $371,950 loan to make improvements to a filtration plant, install flow meters and data acquisition systems and provide disinfection contact piping.

<p>Penn Township Municipal Authority – received a $1,450,000 loan to replace deteriorating water tanks with a new 150,000-gallon, ground-level tank. The project will reduce exposure to iron and manganese and improve water reliability for customers in the service area.</p>
