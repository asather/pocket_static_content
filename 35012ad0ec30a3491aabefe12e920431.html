<h1>Eat’n Park, Goodwill among firms that got $5 million to $10 million in federal PPP loans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Eat’n Park restaurant chain, Collier-based training firm DDI and several Pittsburgh law firms were among the businesses that received loans ranging from $5 million to $10 million from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program designed to help small businesses with payroll and other costs during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Specific loan amounts were not contained in the data released Monday by the U.S. Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>Corporations and nonprofits scrambled to apply for the funds in early April after the government allocated $660 billion in loans as part of the $2 trillion package known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, there were about 32 million small businesses nationwide that employed nearly half the private workforce in the country, according to the SBA.&nbsp;Most have fewer than 100 employees, and many could fail because of government-mandated closures to stop the spread of the coronavirus,&nbsp;the Federal Reserve said in a June report.</p>
<p>The maximum PPP loan amount available is $10 million, and to qualify, firms must have 500 or fewer employees.</p>
<p>The loans, which carry an interest rate of 1%, are fully forgivable if recipients use 60% on payroll costs. The rest can be used for rent, insurance and some other expenses.</p>
<p>Privately held Eat’n Park Hospitality, which had an estimated 5,000 employees in 2018, declined to disclose the specific amount it received.&nbsp;The loan was made through PNC Financial Services Group.</p>
<p>Kevin O’Connell, chief marketing officer for the Homestead-based company, said the hospitality industry received an exemption from the 500-employee limit for PPP loans.&nbsp;“As long as a hospitality company had no single outlet with more than 500 employees, they were eligible to apply,” he said.</p>
<p>When nonessential businesses were ordered shut in March because of the spread of the coronavirus, Eat’n Park sales “dropped 85% overnight,” he said.</p>
<p>It temporarily furloughed about 4,000 employees and closed 16 of its 60 Eat’n Park restaurants, three of its 10 Hello Bistro restaurants and both locations of its Porch restaurant, said Mr. O’Connell.&nbsp;It provided takeout service at locations that remained open.</p>
<p>As of last week, more than 2,000 of those who were furloughed are back at work, and most restaurants are operating with takeout service.</p>
<p>DDI, a private firm that provides training and employee assessment tools and has a global workforce of more than 500, was expected to retain 452 jobs with its loan through Dollar Bank, according to the SBA.&nbsp;The company declined to comment.</p>
<p>Law firms that received loans of $5 million to $10 million include Downtown firms Babst Calland Clements &amp; Zomnir and Dickie McCamey &amp; Chilcote.</p>
<p>Babst Calland’s loan, through PNC, was expected to retain 223 jobs, and Dickie McCamey’s, processed through Dollar Bank, was expected to retain 431 jobs, according to the SBA.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh law firms that received $2 million to $5 million include Burns White, Edgar Snyder &amp; Associates, Tucker Arensberg, and the Webb Law Firm.</p>
<p>Burns White expected to retain 305 jobs; Edgar Snyder, 136 jobs; Tucker Arensberg, 122; and the Webb Law Firm, 149.</p>
<p>Other companies that received between $5 million and $10 million include Dura-Bond Industries of Export, Westmoreland County; Galliker Dairy, Johnstown; and Pittsburgh firms Mascaro Construction, Orbital Engineering, Rycon Construction and Schneider Downs.</p>
<p>Nonprofits were also eligible for the funds.</p>
<p>Among those that received between $5 million and $10 million was Goodwill of Southwestern Pennsylvania, which expected to retain 500 jobs, according to the SBA.</p>
<p>Nonprofits that received loans between $2 million and $5 million included the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, and the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium.</p>
<p>Other nonprofits that received $2 million to $5 million were the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, the Environmental Charter School at Frick Park, Familylinks, Gateway Rehabilitation Corp., the Jewish Association on Aging, Sewickley Academy, Shady Side Academy, La Roche University and Geneva College.</p>
<p>The SBA data included names of firms that received loans exceeding $150,000.&nbsp;Those loans were less than 15% of the nearly 5 million loans distributed to date through the stimulus program.</p>
<p>There is $132 billion in funds remaining, and firms may apply through Aug. 8.</p>
