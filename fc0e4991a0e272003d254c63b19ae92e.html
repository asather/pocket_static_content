<h1>What Bricen Garner's transfer portal decision means for Pitt in 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt should have a little more scholarship space to work with now.</p>
<p>Panthers safety Bricen Garner entered the transfer portal Wednesday afternoon, a source confirmed to the Post-Gazette. The news was <a href="/e/pittsburgh/Article/Pitt-safety-Bricen-Garner-enters-Transfer" target="_blank">first reported</a> by 247 Sports.</p>
<p>Garner, a former Central Catholic standout, just completed his redshirt junior season. Garner is seeking a graduate transfer, meaning he earned his undergraduate degree at Pitt or will receive it in time for the 2020 season. As a grad transfer, he can play immediately wherever he chooses.</p>
<p>Entering the portal doesn’t restrict players from returning to their previous institution, though that’s unlikely.</p>
<p>Should Garner leave, he’d be the sixth Panther to do so since November, joining linebacker Elias Reynolds, offensive lineman Chase Brown, cornerback Therran Coleman, wide receiver Cameron O’Neil and running back V’Lique Carter.</p>
<p>Roster attrition was expected this offseason with the writing on the wall for a few players and positions.</p>
<p>Running back was loaded and still is after Carter’s decision, with five scholarship rushers remaining. Chris Beatty’s wide receiver room is crowded, and O’Neil didn’t factor in the last two seasons. And at safety, Garner wasn’t going to supplant Paris Ford or Damar Hamlin in 2020.</p>
<p>Garner, a former three-star prospect per Rivals, was a part of Pitt’s 2016 recruiting class. Hamlin was the headliner, but Pat Narduzzi and his staff hit on several of those prospects, especially on defense. Along with Hamlin, defensive linemen Rashad Weaver, Patrick Jones II and Keyshon Camp and linebackers Chase Pine and Phil Campbell are projected 2020 starters.</p>
<p>Garner, meanwhile, wasn’t going to see that kind of time. He started six games as a redshirt freshman in 2017, but made only five tackles in limited reps last season. In 33 total appearances, the Pittsburgh native recorded 46 tackles, one interception and a forced fumble.</p>
<p>With Garner’s expected departure, Pitt will rely on rising redshirt sophomore Erick Hallett and redshirt freshman Brandon Hill to back up Ford and Hamlin. With true freshman Buddy Mack, who enrolled early, Pitt will have five scholarship safeties in 2020 — should incoming signees Hunter Sellers and Jahvante Royal stay at cornerback and not switch positions.</p>
<p>Pitt’s scholarship count overall is now at 83, two shy of the 85-scholarship limit.</p>
<p>That isn’t taking into account transfer quarterback Joey Yellen. Whether or not the former Arizona State signal-caller is on scholarship while he sits out the 2020 season is unclear. Other moving parts include Tre Tipton’s appeal and possible decision on a sixth year of eligibility and 2020 verbal commit Timothy Brown’s legal status after being charged with robbery, felony battery and kidnapping in October.</p>
<p>Those questions should be sorted in the coming weeks, especially as national signing day on Feb. 5 approaches.</p>
<p>We know now, though, that Pitt has a little wiggle room. It’s up to Narduzzi to figure out how to best allocate the precious scholarships remaining.</p>
