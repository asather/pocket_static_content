<p>As certain businesses begin reopening, the Pittsburgh Parking Authority said Monday it will temporarily allow the first half-hour of parking to be free to ease takeout and pickup services. People who have parked their car must enter license plate information into parking kiosks or a phone app to receive the free half-hour, and only one free parking session can be used per day, the authority said.</p>
<p>The city said that since it suspended meter enforcement in mid-March, vehicles have remained in parking spots for long periods of time, leading to complaints that restaurants’ takeout customers were having trouble parking.</p>
<p>Enforcement officers&nbsp;on Monday began issuing warnings Downtown for the upcoming change, the city said.</p>
<p>Parking Authority garages Downtown remain open.</p>
<p>Parking meter and residential permit parking enforcement remains suspended in all other city neighborhoods and business districts.</p>
