<h1>Feds charge man with arson during George Floyd protests in Erie</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh said this week that the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force will pursue "violent agitators" who "hijack" protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>They made good on that promise Wednesday in a case brought against Melquan Barnett, 28, of Erie.</p>
<p>Mr. Barnett is accused of malicious destruction of property using fire or explosives during a Saturday protest in Erie. After the protest was "hijacked," prosecutors said, Mr. Barnett set a fire at Ember + Forge, a coffee shop on State Street.</p>
<p>"The First Amendment does not permit people to use a protest as cover to commit arson, destroy property or incite violence,” said U.S. Attorney Scott Brady. “Any protesters who cross this line should know that we will use every tool at our disposal to find you and prosecute you.”</p>
<p>A criminal complaint filed in federal court alleges that video footage from Facebook Live and the coffee shop show a man shattering the shop's window facing State Street. The videos also show a man setting a fire inside the coffee shop.</p>
<p>The man in the second video had distinctive hair to the middle of his back and was wearing a white mask, white shirt, light blue jean jacket, black pants with a red and white striped pattern down the side and red shoes. He also had a tattoo on the left side of his neck.</p>
<p>A review of more Facebook video footage from the area near City Hall from that evening shows the same man without a mask but wearing the same clothing. His face is fully visible on the video, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Erie police reviewed the footage and identified Mr. Barnett as the culprit.</p>
<p>He was taken into custody in Erie on Wednesday and was set to appear in federal court Thursday for an initial hearing.</p>
