<h1>Region's cocaine ringleader pleads guilty</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Repeat Florida felon Don Juan Mendoza pleaded guilty Friday to charges related to his role as the ringleader of a network that shipped cocaine from Los Angeles and Atlanta to a secluded house on Harvest Lane in Penn Hills, described by a prosecutor as the center for coke distribution for the entire region.</p>
<p>Mendoza, a New York native who spent most of his life in Jacksonville, Fla., will be sentenced June 17. He faces at least 15 years in prison but could get a life term based on his long history of dealing drugs, which began when he was in the sixth grade.</p>
<p>Asked by U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak if he did all the things that Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Lanni said he did, he answered, "Yes, sir, I did."</p>
<p>Mendoza, 39, admitted that he orchestrated drug shipments in an RV for cross-country drug runs to the home of Jamie Lightfoot Jr. in Penn Hills. He also admitted to possession of guns, which he can't have because he's a felon.</p>
<p>The FBI and state police said he also arranged for drug shipments from Atlanta to Penn Hills using a van imprinted with the promotional image of his rapper wife, Charlene Mendoza, known as "Sno-Cold."</p>
<p>Lightfoot and his brother Deaubre, of Monessen, were Mendoza's lieutenants, responsible for distributing narcotics across the region, especially in Fayette County. Both have pleaded guilty. William Shaw of Brownsville, the chief distributor in Fayette, pleaded guilty Thursday.</p>
<p>Mendoza and others were charged in November 2017 after the FBI and police tracked the RV from California to Penn Hills following months of wiretapped cellphone calls. On Nov. 5, 2017, they seized 52 kilos of cocaine, 85 pounds of marijuana and two guns, one of them an AK-47.</p>
<p>Mendoza had flown in from Atlanta for the delivery and pulled up in a rented Chevy Tahoe shortly after the RV arrived. Agents took him into custody and he's been in jail since.</p>
<p>This time, it's a fair bet that he will never get out, considering his life of crime.</p>
<p>Mendoza has gone to prison three times previously for drug dealing in Florida. In the 2000s, he cooperated with law officers and helped them solve four murders, which earned him a sentence reduction.</p>
<p>His cooperation, however, also made him a target in his hometown, where gunmen shot him in the head in 2013.</p>
<p>He moved to North Carolina after the shooting and told a judge in 2015 that that he was finished with drug trafficking and wanted to focus on running hair salons with his wife and raising their children in Charlotte.</p>
<p>But he didn't leave the drug life; prosecutors have said the hair salons were money-laundering fronts.</p>
<p>Mendoza moved to Atlanta, where he used his contacts with drug sources in California and elsewhere, as well as connections to Mexican drug cartels, to arrange for drug shipments into Pittsburgh, agents said.</p>
<p>In his plea, Mendoza accepted responsibility for distributing between 50 and 150 kilos of cocaine.</p>
