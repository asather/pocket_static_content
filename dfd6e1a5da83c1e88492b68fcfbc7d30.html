<h1>Protesters gather in Mellon Park, discuss organizer's treatment </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Around 50 people gathered in Mellon Park Saturday night as part of an action to protest racial injustice.</p>
<p>According to a flyer that was posted on social media, Saturday’s event was titled, “Uncivil Saturday’s / Bar Crawl with Gamm’s Seltzers”, with the purpose to disrupt, educate and that “Black womxn voices will be amplified only.”</p>
<p>Around 30 minutes into the start of the protest, leaders told the crowd that Nique Craft, who also goes by the name Gam, one of the protest organizers, had been “picked up” by police earlier Saturday and would not be able to attend the night’s action. Leaders then told the group they would not be marching to avoid the possibility of making circumstances more difficult for Craft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a court docket, police filed charges against Craft, on Sept. 17. Craft was put in Allegheny County Jail Saturday with bail set at $10,000, according to the document.&nbsp;Police are accusing Craft of riot, conspiracy, terroristic threats, simple assault, harassment and disorderly conduct with the incident date listed for Sept. 5.</p>
<p>Craft’s lawyer, Paul Jubas, said&nbsp;he would have no comment until more information was available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These charges are in addition to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/09/15/protesters-charged-clash-with-diners-Downtown-Pittsburgh/stories/202009150105" target="_blank">other charges police filed earlier this week against Craft</a> in connection with a confrontation with Downtown diners during the protest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During Saturday’s peaceful event in Mellon Park, organizers spoke to the crowd about how the charges filed against Craft were not justified.</p>
<p>One protester told the crowd about the events leading up to the confrontation with diners during the Sept. 5 protest.</p>
<p>Before the confrontation that was caught on video, the protester told the crowd that Craft had been sitting down on the sidewalk eating lunch when three white men came up to Craft and started harassing Craft with phrases that include, “All Lives Matter”. The protester then continued that a person started swinging their bike at Craft, and another man put their hand on Craft’s chest, the protester said.</p>
