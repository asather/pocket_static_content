<h1>Securities regulators identify four unregistered Pittsburgh firms </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The telephone number is no longer in service at the Downtown office of Kobe Asset Management and there are no records of the financial services firm being registered with the Pennsylvania Department of State.</p>
<p>Kobe is one of four Pittsburgh financial firms cited recently by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly using inaccurate information to solicit investors.</p>
<p>SEC officials released a list that identified hundreds of financial firms across the country that have been the subject of investor complaints.</p>
<p>Each individual firm’s issues may vary but the SEC targeted a variety of unethical and deceptive practices, including impersonating other registered securities firms and falsely claiming endorsements by government agencies and international organizations that sound authentic but don’t exist.</p>
<p>The SEC, which oversees the securities industry, also announced improvements to its Pause program website that allows the public to verify if a firm soliciting investments is indeed properly registered.</p>
<p>The Pause program — which stands for Public Alert: Unregistered Soliciting Entities — is designed to prevent bad operators from preying on victims by “arming investors with information in real time to help them ask tough questions before giving their hard-earned money to strangers,” according to a statement by the SEC.</p>
<p>Other Pittsburgh firms on the SEC’s new list include&nbsp;Capital Trust Management LLC on Washington Road, which has shut down its website; Maxwell Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Group Inc. in Wilkins; and the Lawrenceville-based investment firm Capital Acquisitions Group, which now has an automated message on its phone system notifying callers that it will automatically hang up on them.</p>
<p>SEC officials declined to provide specific details about complaints against the companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s difficult to say when these firms either began or ceased to do business in Pittsburgh because there is no record of them registering as corporations with the Pennsylvania Department of State.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC noted that just because a company is included on the Pause list does not mean regulators have found violations of the federal securities laws or made a judgment about the merits of any securities being offered by the firm.</p>
<p>Generally only larger advisers — those that have $25 million or more of assets under management or that provide advice to investment company clients — are required to register with the SEC. Smaller advisers typically register under state law with state securities authorities.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of registering with the SEC is for the&nbsp;disclosure of important financial information that enables investors to make informed judgments about whether to purchase a company's securities. The SEC&nbsp;doesn’t guarantee the accuracy of the information, but investors who purchase securities and suffer losses can recover their money&nbsp;if they can prove the information a company provided with incomplete or inaccurate.</p>
<p>The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy said in a statement that the largest complaint received by the SEC concerns solicitations of investors by unregistered entities that appear to be involved in boiler room and secondary advance fee schemes.</p>
<p>Boiler room operations use high-pressure sales tactics generally over the telephone and solicit investors with false and/or misleading information to invest in securities, such as stocks and bonds. The schemes are disbanded and the wrongdoers disappear after investors wire their money, which is then transferred to offshore accounts.</p>
<p>Secondary “advance fee” schemes work very similar to boiler room operations — the difference being that an advance fee scheme usually targets investors who purchased underperforming securities, perhaps through an affiliated boiler room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unregistered firms offer to arrange a lucrative sale of those securities, but first require the payment of an advance fee in the form of a commission, a regulatory fee or tax or some other incidental expense. The advance fees are paid, but the promised sale of the securities is never arranged.</p>
<p>Companies engaged in these practices could be investigated for possible securities law violations, but the SEC said there are usually obstacles to effective enforcement.</p>
<p>Soliciting entities change names frequently, often before law enforcement action can be taken. Often the firms claim to be based in the U.S., but in fact operate from numerous jurisdictions overseas. Working on investigations with foreign securities regulators also can be complex and time-consuming.</p>
