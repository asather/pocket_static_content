<h1>Owner demolishes 1840s Ewalt House in Lawrenceville </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A crew hired by the owners of a Lawrenceville home built around 1840 began demolishing the Greek Revival-style structure on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The former residence of Samuel Ewalt — &nbsp;a merchant, sheriff and state legislator — was nominated for city historic landmark status last year but failed to receive enough votes from City Council members.</p>
<p>Eric Rupert, a Hampton masonry contractor, inherited the house at 186 Home St. when his father, George, died in 2016.</p>
<p>As a crane caved in the second floor of the red-brick house Wednesday, Beth Rupert, his wife, said it posed a danger to city residents. After a windstorm damaged the home last August, she said, engineer Dirk Taylor assessed it and recommended “carefully demolishing the deteriorated house before it collapses.”</p>
<p>City Councilwoman Deb Gross, who represents Lawrenceville, called the demolition “sickening and disheartening.”</p>
<p>“The city’s inspectors assessed it and decided that it was not in danger of falling down. Buyers were willing to immediately stabilize it,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Gross said she believes the Ruperts had always intended to demolish the house. She&nbsp;said Mrs. Rupert “never did work with the community. She didn’t return phone calls. She refused to follow up on conversations. She would promise to work with prospective buyers and then refuse to work with prospective buyers. There was a mismatch between word and deed.”</p>
<p>Architect Keith Cochran nominated the Ewalt House as a city landmark, noting that it was one of a few pre-Civil War homes left in Lawrenceville. The Ruperts opposed the nomination, calling it a taking of their property.</p>
<p>The city’s Historic Review Commission and its Planning Commission both recommended historic designation. City Council voted in July to delay action on the measure and on Aug. 26 voted 5-2 to withdraw the historic nomination, with Ms. Gross and Councilman Bruce Kraus opposed and two members absent. On Sept. 24, the city approved a demolition permit.</p>
<p>Ronald L. Hicks Jr., a Pittsburgh attorney, said he represented an investment group that offered $415,000 in cash for the house as is. Mrs. Rupert insisted that the deal close within a week instead of 60 days, Mr. Hicks said.</p>
<p>Neighbors, some of whom had been notified that demolition was imminent, were sad to see the house fall.&nbsp;Eric Kukura opened The Abbey, a coffee shop, bar and restaurant on Butler Street, in 2016. He said he chose the location partly because he liked the neighborhood’s architectural character and charm.</p>
<p>“Butler Street reminded me of Carson Street back in the late ’80s when there were antique shops, art galleries and white linen tablecloth restaurants,” he said.</p>
<p>“One of the frustrations that I have seen is that City Council doesn’t follow the lead of their respective councilperson. As a group, they were fragmented.&nbsp;Deb Gross went to the mat to try to do what she could for the neighborhood,” Mr. Kukura said.</p>
<p>Other council members “caved to the pressure of somebody from the suburbs who really had a windfall fall into their lap here,” he said.</p>
<p>City Councilman Ricky Burgess did not support historic designation for the house because the Ruperts opposed it. He also voted in favor of withdrawing the nomination in August.</p>
<p>“As always, I am supportive of preserving things for history. At the same time, I am very reticent to take away property rights of owners,” Mr. Burgess said.</p>
<p>“As an African American, I am suspicious when the rights of individuals are taken away. That has spelled disaster for African Americans throughout history.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ruperts have been in talks for more than a year with developer Duncan Ventures about the property.&nbsp;Last October, the city’s zoning board approved three variances so Duncan Ventures could build&nbsp;five four-story townhouses with garages fronting on Eden Way, an alley that intersects with Home Street.&nbsp;Lawrenceville Stakeholders, a nonprofit advocacy group, appealed.</p>
<p>On July 13, Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Joseph James overturned the zoning board’s decision. On Monday, Duncan Ventures appealed that ruling to Commonwealth Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Kukura’s business is just steps from the house and Eden Way.</p>
<p>“I don’t look forward to five townhouses in the alley and residents who will ultimately be unhappy with commercial deliveries from my purveyors, garbage trucks and beer trucks.&nbsp;It’s not a spot for residential development,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Duncan Ventures builds townhouses on Eden Way, their residents will face the back of a commercial storefront Mr. Kukura is expanding on Butler Street to open a restaurant&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There will be five fools that will buy those houses,” he said, predicting that the townhouses “will ultimately end up being investment rentals.”</p>
<p>“The second time, the resale won’t be there.”</p>
