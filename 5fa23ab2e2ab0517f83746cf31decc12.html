<h1>Giant Eagle, other major retailers limiting customers in their stores</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Giant Eagle said Monday that it would begin limiting the number of customers allowed in its supermarkets in a dramatic attempt to help stop the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The announcement follows a similar move by retail giants Walmart and Target, which began implementing the policy nationwide on Saturday.</p>
<p>“The safety and well-being of our team members and guests is and will continue to be our top priority,” Giant Eagle spokeswoman Jannah Jablonowski said in a statement.</p>
<p>The O’Hara-based supermarket chain said each location would admit up to 50% of the maximum occupancy allowed under fire codes. The limits won’t apply to Giant Eagle’s Get-Go convenience stores.</p>
<p>Essential businesses that have been allowed to remain open during the pandemic — including supermarkets and pharmacies — have been taking steps to help protect their workers and customers from catching the novel coronavirus. Stores are sanitizing touch points like never before, while clerks ring up customers behind Plexiglas partitions and shoppers in checkout lanes stand at floor markers enforcing social distancing.</p>
<p>A trip to a local Giant Eagle Sunday morning found the vast majority of shoppers donning masks or bandanas following Gov. Tom Wolf’s pronouncement Friday that all Pennylvanians should wear face coverings if they must leave their homes.</p>
<p>While the store’s customers were complying, none of the Giant Eagle employees observed wore any type of mask, including workers at the meat and deli counters, baggers at the registers, workers stocking shelves and those filling online delivery orders in aisles throughout the store.</p>
<p>Giant Eagle on Monday said it was supplying personal protective equipment — including masks and gloves — to its employees “should they be interested in wearing it.”</p>
<p>Tom Charley, co-owner of three Shop ‘n Save stores in Greensburg and Murrysville, said he was recommending that his employees wear masks, but wasn’t mandating it.</p>
<p>He said a shipment of some 3,000 medical grade N95 masks was due shortly, which would be provided to workers who want them. “Some employees had masks that they are wearing, and some have made their own,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Charley said there are no current plans to limit the number of shoppers in his stores.</p>
<p>“I appreciate Walmart taking a stand. But we are nowhere near the density that Walmart has,” he said. The new limits are twice the density his Shop ‘n Save stores have during their busiest times, he said.</p>
<p>Walmart said it would allow no more than five customers for every 1,000 square feet of space, which is roughly 20% of capacity. Once a store reaches capacity, customers will be admitted on a one-out, one-in basis, the company said.</p>
<p>“While many of our customers have been following the advice of the medical community regarding social distancing, we have been concerned to still see some behaviors in our stores that put undue risk on our people,” Walmart said in a statement announcing the action.</p>
<p>“We want to encourage customers to bring the fewest number of people per family necessary to shop, allow for space with other customers while shopping and practice social distancing while waiting in lines.”</p>
