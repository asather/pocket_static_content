<p>ORLANDO, Fla. — Disney Cruise Line became the latest to delay its sailings into June because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>An update to the cruise line’s website said Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy, which sail out of Port Canaveral, have canceled cruises that depart through June 18.</p>
<p>Disney Magic, which was scheduled to go to Europe for the summer, had all sailings canceled until mid-July while Disney Wonder, which was slated to be in Alaska, won’t sail until Canada opens its ports up after July 1.</p>
<p>The next scheduled cruise for Disney Fantasy is now June 20, Disney Dream is now June 21, Disney Wonder is July 6 and Disney Magic is July 13.</p>
<p>The line is offering either a full refund or the option to use funds on a future cruise credit for up to 15 months from the original sail date.</p>
<p>Disney is the last major cruise line to push its plans to start sailing again in the wake of an updated “no sail order” from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all cruise ships from U.S. ports. Originally enacted March 14, the update given earlier in April potentially extends the order through July 17.</p>
<p>The order would not apply to cruise lines sailing to and from other nations around the world.</p>
<p>Disney had until Monday already canceled Disney Dream and Fantasy sailings through May 17 and Disney Magic through June 7, while Disney Wonder’s Alaska plans were already on hold.</p>

<p>Last week, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, which also includes Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas, extended its suspension of sailings through June 30.</p>
<p>Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara, three brands under parent company Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., had already pushed plans to resume itineraries to no earlier than June 12.</p>
<p>And Carnival Cruise Line canceled all sailings through June 26 as well as all sailings out of San Francisco through 2020, all Carnival Sunrise sailings through Oct. 19, all Carnival Legend sailings through Oct. 30 and all Carnival Radiance sailings through Nov. 1.</p>
<p>Princess Cruises, a sister brand to Carnival and one of several under the Carnival Corp. parent company, originally enacted a 60-day halt through May 10 but this week decided to extend cancellations through June 30. It’s one of the hardest-hit cruise lines in terms of coronavirus outbreaks on board. It was at the center of an outbreak on its Diamond Princess cruise ship in Asia that sickened more than 700 passengers and crew and left 12 dead.</p>
<p>Holland America, another Carnival Corp. brand, has also suspended sailings through June 30. Cunard Line has suspended sailings of its three ships through May 15.</p>
<p>MSC Cruises, which sails several ships out of Miami, had already decided to extend its cancellations to all cruises through May 29.</p>
<p>New cruise line Virgin Voyages was originally set to debut its new ship Scarlet Lady at a Miami ceremony in March, but is now waiting until at least July 15 before it begins some showcase sailings followed by its official maiden voyage on Aug. 7.</p>
<p>Most cruise lines have offered full refunds for the canceled cruises or to apply the cruise costs to a future cruise with an on-board credit. Check each cruise line’s website for details.</p>
