<h1>Riverhounds 'comfortable' allowing players to either stand or kneel for national anthem</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Shortly before kickoff between <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/soccer/2020/07/22/Riverhounds-Indy-Eleven-USL-soccer-Tyler-Pasher-Tomas-Gomez-Robbie-Mertz/stories/202007220137" target="_blank">Riverhounds SC and Indy Eleven</a> on Wednesday, 21 players knelt on the turf as the national anthem played. A few here and there held their fists in the air.</p>
<p>It was a show of support for the Black Lives Matter movement, a common sight recently ahead of professional sporting events in the U.S. and abroad, a way to peacefully protest racial inequality and police brutality.</p>
<p>Robbie Mertz, however, was the 22nd player on the field ahead of kickoff Wednesday night, and the Pittsburgh midfielder stood tall, facing the American flag beyond the east stand at Highmark Stadium. Coach Bob Lilley remained standing, too, ahead of the 1-0 defeat.</p>
<p>“We’re comfortable with that as an organization, that if players feel a certain way, and they want to stand or kneel, that’s up to them,” Lilley said after the game. “We have a close group. For me, I respect all of our guys to — and they’ve had the talks. We’ve let them have their talks and they’re comfortable.”</p>
<p>Almost four years ago, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first sat during the national anthem, creating a polarizing dialogue surrounding how players protest amid the search for social change. Kaepernick, now 32, still hasn’t found his way back into the NFL.</p>
<p>Kneeling during the anthem has been thrust back into the spotlight following the May death of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes while Floyd was handcuffed.</p>
<p>Before each Premier League game in England, players take a knee. “Black Lives Matter” replaced players’ names on jerseys for the first week games returned in that league. As MLB ramps up preparations for a truncated season, some players have also taken knees, such as Joey Votto and other members of the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
<p>Lilley understands and appreciates the reasoning behind it. But he still chooses to stand during the anthem.</p>
<p>“Some coaches kneel; I stand. You know, my dad’s military,” Lilley said. “I still believe in Black Lives Matter, so to me, it’s just everybody doing what you feel comfortable with. ... I think you need to be able to think in these times, and still respect everyone’s values and opinions and everything else.</p>
<p>“There’s plenty of people that are probably kneeling right now that probably haven’t really taken full stock of everything that’s going on in our world.”</p>
