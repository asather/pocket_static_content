<p>NEW YORK — Mayor Bill de Blasio’s daughter was arrested Saturday night during a protest near Union Square, police sources said.</p>
<p>Chiara de Blasio, 25, was busted on 12th Street and Broadway, as part of a group of about 100 people who were throwing objects toward cops, sources said.</p>
<p>The mayor’s daughter didn’t toss anything, but refused to leave the area when cops ordered her to do so, sources said.</p>
<p>She was arrested at 10:30 p.m. Saturday, given a desk appearance ticket charging her with unlawful assembly, and released, one source said.</p>
<p>She gave her dad’s Gracie Mansion address to the arrest cops.</p>
<p>According to another source, Chiara de Blasio has been quarantining at Gracie Mansion with her brother, Dante; mom, Chirlane McCray, and the mayor.</p>
<p>The NYPD made 345 arrests by early Sunday after a chaotic night of protests and looting in New York City over the death of George Floyd that saw 33 cops injured and 47 police vehicles damaged, sources said.</p>
<p>Shortly after his daughter’s arrest, the mayor spoke out against the growing violence at the protests.</p>
<p>“If you went out peacefully to make a point for the need for change, you have been heard and change is coming. It’s time to go home so we can all move forward,” Mr. de Blasio said. “But those who are out there simply to express violence and express hatred against our police officers, if you are going to commit violence you will get arrested. You will feel the consequences of that activity.”</p>
<p>City Hall declined to immediately comment Sunday night.</p>
