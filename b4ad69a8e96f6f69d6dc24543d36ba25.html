<h1>Migrating birds passed overhead, and some stopped in Shanksville</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 10pt;">Tens of thousands of migrating birds have passed over southwestern Pennsylvania since Sunday, and more flyovers are expected.&nbsp;It is not Pittsburgh’s Alfred Hitchcock moment, and the climate is not collapsing in a puff of feathers. But there is a scientific explanation for what is happening.</span></span></p>
<p>It’s called autumn.</p>
<p>Bird migrations are triggered by photoperiod, or hours of light in a day. Brian Shema, an ornithologist and operations director at Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania, said that local weather conditions might influence individual birds to begin their spring or fall journeys a day or two earlier or later. Like any traveler, a migrating bird may stop flying until bad weather blows over.</p>
<p>“Just like if you and I were planning a flag football game,” he said. “If it’s raining we may wait a day or two until it stops.”</p>
<p>Small birds from Canadian woodlands began routine southward migration weeks ago. Nearly 900 million birds including 100 species of warblers, vireos, tanagers, thrushes, fly catchers and sparrows are believed to have migrated across the United States Sunday and Monday. An estimated 30,000 passed over Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The largest concentrations in the U.S. central flyway, including Western Pennsylvania, generally fly by a week or 10 days before the first day of fall, Sept. 22. Local weather made last weekend the most conducive avian travel days.&nbsp;On Friday, Mr. Shema&nbsp;was among ornithologists invited to the September 11 Memorial in Somerset county to assist in mitigating the disruption of nighttime migrations caused by the annual Tribute in Light.</p>
<p>“As part of the commemoration, 40 neon lights were aimed at the sky to create a column of light,” he said. ”Once turned on, in about 5 minutes you’d see birds in that light that were probably mesmerized. Their navigational ability seemed to have disappeared. They don’t know how to fly out of the light.”</p>
<p>The same impact on night-flying birds has been noticed over New York City. In Pittsburgh, migrating birds used to get caught in columns of “victory light” projected over the Cathedral of Learning to signal wins by University of Pittsburgh sports teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s ongoing research to fully understand why birds are attracted to light,” said Mr. Shema. “We know that if a beam is turned on for five hours, birds caught in the beam will weaken and might die.”</p>
<p>With the help of Audubon, Pitt altered its light show. The National Park Service brought ornithologists to Shanksville this weekend to oversee adaptation of the Tribute in Light.</p>
<p>“At its peak you could see about 1,000 birds caught in the beam,” Mr. Shema said. “When one seemed to be exiting the light, it would turn and reenter.”</p>
<p>Initially the beam was programmed to shine for 40 minutes and turn off for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>“We tried staggering the light in a randomized pattern, but that didn’t work,” he said. “We reprogrammed the beam to shine for 30 minutes on, 15 minutes off, and that seemed to work best.”</p>
<p>Outdoor household lighting has been shown to also confuse birds and insects.</p>
<p>“The big story, in my opinion,” said Mr. Shema, “is how each homeowner can take steps to help bird migration over their homes by dimming or eliminating as much outdoor lighting as possible.”</p>
<p>To draw attention to the conservation benefits of reducing light pollution under migrating birds, <a href="https://cornell.zoom.us" target="_blank">Cornell Lab of Ornithology,</a> a global leader in avian research, will hold an informational webinar titled Lights Out to Protect Migratory Birds at 1-1:30 p.m. Thursday.

<p>Heavy mid-September bird migrations over Pittsburgh are nothing new. But the scientific means of forecasting migration patterns is evolving.</p>
<p>“Really, nothing is changing,” said Mr. Shema. “Bird migrations are about the same as they’ve always been. I believe what has happened is there are some pretty cool tools now available to birdwatchers to help them to understand what days might be good days to go birdwatching.”</p>
<p>One of them, <a href="https://birdcast.info/" target="_blank">BirdCast</a>, is a digital feature sponsored in part by the National Science Foundation and Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Since 2018, BirdCast combines data from many years of ground-based bird counts, cloud-based computing and big data analytics. Algorithms forecast the approximate number of birds migrating over continental United States. Real-time migration maps predict how many birds may actually take flight daily and their regional concentrations.</p>
<p>Long-term statistical analysis is underway to determine if migration patterns are subtly changing, but Mr. Shema said conclusions are premature.</p>
<p>“It is possible that bird migrations might change over a long time to adjust to climate change, but that has yet to be seen,” he said. “Some data sets are collected on a daily basis. We’re waiting for it to be statistically valid that some species are beginning to migrate sooner or later than normal.”</p>
<p>If that is occurring, it is more likely during south-to-north migrations in the spring.</p>
<p>“If birds use day length as a migratory starting point, insect hatches are starting sooner and green leaf growth is happening early,” said Mr. Shema. “Northward migration and food availability could become misaligned when the birds need it most.”</p>
<p>Technology enables birders to understand regional migration patterns, but can’t show them specifically where birds might stop to rest.</p>
<p>“The trick for birdwatchers is where to watch,” said Mr. Shema. “Sometimes birds will fly through the night, other times they put down at night in places where they can be near food.”</p>
<p>In the Pittsburgh area, he said that might be Fern Hollow Nature Center in Sewickley, Frick Park in Squirrel Hill, Boyce Mayview Park in Upper St. Clair or Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve in Fox Chapel, home of the Audubon Society.</p>
