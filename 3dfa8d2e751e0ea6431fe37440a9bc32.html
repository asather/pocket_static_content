<h1>Trump tabs sports leaders to advise on reopening the country</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>To advise him on reopening the country, which has been largely shut down due to coronavirus, President Donald Trump has tabbed the leaders of 11 sports leagues and federations and three prominent owners</p>
<p>At his press briefing Tuesday, Trump listed an advisory committee that included: England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, NBA commissioner Adam Silver, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, UFC president Dana White, PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, LPGA commissioner Michael Whan, USTA chairman Patrick Galbraith, MLS commissioner Don Garber, NASCAR vice chairperson Lesa Kennedy, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and WWE chairman Vince McMahon.</p>
<p>Trump stressed the importance of restarting sports to the economy.</p>

<p>“We want to get our sports back so importantly,” Trump said. “We have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old," he said. "But I haven’t actually had too much time to watch. I would say maybe I watch one batter and then I get back to work.”</p>
<p>Trump met by phone with many U.S. pro sports leaders on April 4 to discuss how that industry has been affected by the global coronavirus pandemic, saying he was looking forward to the resumption of competitions "as soon as we can."</p>
<p>Trump previously stated he hoped to reopen the country on May 1.</p>
<p>The full panel, which the White House has dubbed the Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups, includes more than 50 executives and leaders from agricultural, defense and financial service industries, as well as leaders from unions, professional sports, think tanks and more.</p>
<p>Cuban said he was given a heads up about an hour before the announcement.</p>
<p>Cuban has been very vocal regarding steps political leaders and businesses should be taking in these difficult times. So much so that thoughts of a 2020 presidential run even resurfaced regarding the Mavs owner.</p>
<p>"I'm absolutely looking forward to trying to help," Cuban told The Daily Beast, per Asawin Suebsaeng. "I'll find out more tomorrow, I believe."</p>
<p>For his part, McMahon’s inclusion on the&nbsp;advisory-committee list came a day after his&nbsp;World Wrestling Entertainment made international headlines for being deemed an “essential business” in Florida and resumed live shows, albeit without a live audience.</p>
