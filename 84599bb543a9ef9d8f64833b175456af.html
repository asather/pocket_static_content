<h1>‘This Is Us’ goes full Pittsburgh and donates meals to local hospitals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The cast of the NBC drama “This Is Us” doesn’t just play characters from Pittsburgh. They take the “We Are Family” thing seriously.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Emmy-winning actor Sterling K. Brown and his castmates coordinated with Frontline Foods to pay for more than 260 meals from <a href="https://www.caferaymond.com/" target="_blank">Cafe Raymond</a> in the Strip District and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/saludjuiceryoakland/posts/539118510129838" target="_blank">Salúd Juicery Oakland of Oakland</a> to be delivered to health care and other staff members at Jefferson Hospital and Allegheny Valley Hospital in Natrona Heights, as well as medical centers in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Cafe Raymond owner Raymond Mikesell — whose wife, Marie, is a nurse — went to work with their son at 3:30 a.m. and had the first delivery ready by 7:45 Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>There were five people working on the order and deliveries, including Marie — Mr. Mikesell usually has a staff of 15, but he has been rotating five at a time because business has been slow during this time of social distancing. He has done catering before for Allegheny General Hospital and knows about creating and wrapping individual meals, but this was a tall order, and a most welcome one.</p>
<p>"I have delivered to area hospitals before through donations and I guess it was sheer luck that they liked what I did," Mr. Mikesell said of getting this order. "I have been open, but business has been slow since February. This means a lot."</p>
<p>He added that Frontline was "really great to work with. They go above and beyond, and they make sure you go above and beyond, too."</p>
<p>Salúd Juicery posted on its Facebook page Tuesday that it had&nbsp;“celebrated the work of our Healthcare Heroes at Allegheny Valley and Jefferson Hospital! We had the honor of partnering with Frontline Foods Pittsburgh to deliver 260 juices donated by Sterling K. Brown and the cast of ‘This Is Us’!”</p>
<p>Frontline Foods, which partners with the nonprofit World Central Kitchen, raises money to allow local restaurants to make and deliver meals to health care workers on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, using 100% of the tax-deductible donations.</p>
