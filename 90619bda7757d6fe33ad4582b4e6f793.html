<h1>Game of the week: Numbers don't lie? Aliquippa begs to differ</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Check this out: Chartiers Valley held Aliquippa to minus-2 yards of offense in the first quarter — and Chartiers Valley trailed by two touchdowns.</p>
<p>More from the strange but true: Chartiers Valley held Aliquippa to 44 yards in the first two quarters — and trailed by 15 points at halftime.</p>
<p>And get this: Chartiers had 2 more yards of offense than Aliquippa for the game — and Aliquippa won by four touchdowns.</p>
<p>Sometimes statistics indeed don’t tell the real story, and the truth about Aliquippa was big numbers added up to an easy 35-6 victory for the Quips against visiting Chartiers Valley Friday night in an important WPIAL Class 4A Parkway Conference game.</p>
<p>Aliquippa thrived on big plays and the big scoring plays didn’t come just on offense. They were on defense and special plays. Aliquippa scored on an 84-yard kickoff return, 102-yard interception return and two runs of 55 and 46 yards. The undefeated Quips (5-0 overall, 3-0 in conference) now have 12 scoring plays of 40 yards or more this season.</p>
<p>Chartiers Valley coach Dan Knause had been telling his team all week that it had to stop Aliquippa’s “splash plays” if the Colts wanted to keep their record perfect. But the Colts (4-1, 2-1) executed that plan like a belly smacker.</p>
<p>“It’s frustrating,” Knause said. “We preached about splash plays. But you have to tip your hat to Aliquippa and credit them.</p>
<p>“I like our defense if we make people work. We knew we were the best defense [Aliquippa] faced this year by far. Our design was to not give up splash plays and make them work. But we made things a little too easy.”</p>
<p>If big plays are splash plays, Aliquippa’s Vernon Redd was all wet again. A master of big plays the past two seasons, Redd, a senior, had three touchdowns against Chartiers Valley — the long kickoff return and two long runs. Redd’s special teams touchdown came on the opening kickoff.</p>
<p>“I can’t explain it,” Redd said. “They took their shot and gave me the ball. I showed them to stop kicking to me.”</p>
<p>Aliquippa coach Mike Warfield said, “That was a fast start and I think that just gave the kids some energy and life.”</p>
<p>Chartiers Valley, off to its best start to a season in more than a decade, showed life later in the first quarter, driving from the 25 to Aliquippa’s 5. On third-and-goal, Anthony Mackey tried to hit a receiver on a slant pattern, but Aliquippa junior defensive back Cyair Clark tipped the ball into the air, grabbed it in the end zone, and ended up in the other end zone. Clark had a 102-yard interception return with 36 seconds left in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Redd, who finished with 144 yards on 16 carries, scored on a 55-yard run in the second quarter before Chartiers Valley got on the scoreboard when Mackey lofted a pass near the goal line, where receiver Anthony Collura, who had seven receptions for the game, fought off a defender and pulled the ball in for a 21-yard touchdown.</p>
<p>Chartiers Valley outgained Aliquippa by 171-44 in the first two quarters, but still trailed, 21-6. For the game, Chartiers Valley outgained Aliquippa, 275-273. Mackey completed 18 of 29 passes for 207 yards, but Chartiers Valley had only 56 yards rushing against Aliquippa’s beefy defensive front.</p>
<p>Aliquippa’s Karl McBride, who rushed for 108 yards on 12 carries, all in the second half, scored on an 8-yard run in the third quarter before Redd’s 46-yard scoring run in the fourth.</p>
<p>With only two games left in the regular season, Aliquippa is undefeated after moving up from Class 3A to 4A this season.</p>
<p>“We’re young, but I’m pleased with how our young guys are playing,” Warfield said. “The guys up front are starting to get it and that’s impressive. I’m proud of them. We push them, but they’re starting to understand that we push them for games like this.”</p>
