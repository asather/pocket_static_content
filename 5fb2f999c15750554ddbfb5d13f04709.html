<h1>Port Authority sued over ban on Black Lives Matter masks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The union representing Port Authority employees filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday seeking an injunction to allow workers to wear masks that say Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>The suit filed by Local 85 of the Amalgamated Transit Union claims the authority is violating the free speech and free association rights of employees. It is seeking an injunction to invalidate the authority’s policy adopted in July that prohibits employees from wearing anything of&nbsp;“a political or social protest nature” at work.</p>
<p>The complaint also seeks to rescind discipline against three employees who violated the policy by refusing to remove Back Lives Matter masks, bus driver training supervisors Sascha Craig and Monika Wheeler and driver/union officer James Hanna.</p>
<p>The suit claims the authority amended its Uniform Standards for Port Authority Operators to include the&nbsp;“sweepingly over-broad policy” prohibiting political or social messages on masks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said the agency hadn’t received notice of the suit and doesn’t comment on litigation.</p>
<p>The suit claims the authority itself endorses issues such as Black Lives Matter, Gay Pride and other social causes, so it shouldn’t prohibit employees from supporting them. Previously, the agency has said it is concerned that employee support for such issues could make riders feel uncomfortable or otherwise disrupt transit rides.</p>
<p>Attorneys Joseph J. Pass and Patrick K. Lemon wrote in their complaint the authority&nbsp;“cannot now claim that employees’ support of that same policy constitutes an undue threat of disruption.” The suit said there have been no disruptions and the agency shouldn’t be allowed to bar free expression on the chance there would be disruption in the future.</p>
<p>The suit includes as an exhibit a Sept. 3 letter from CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman to employees explaining the policy. In it, she claims federal law prohibits public agencies such as Port Authority from allowing employees to express political or social messages unless it allows all messages.</p>
<p>That is different from the agency wrapping buses with such messages, she said.</p>
<p>“Wrapping vehicles with an appropriate design was intended to help us acknowledge the local&nbsp;event and those who participate and attend,” she wrote. “This involvement always was reviewed and&nbsp;endorsed by the Authority's senior management as an expression of community support decided&nbsp;by the agency, not any one individual employee.</p>
<p>“The look and design of employee uniforms also is an organizational decision&nbsp;— not an employee&nbsp;decision. We do not want to change this so that our customers have a consistent experience&nbsp;when using our system.”</p>
