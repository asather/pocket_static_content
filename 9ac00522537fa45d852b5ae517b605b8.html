<h1>Philips Respironics to start 'large scale production' on new ventilator</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dutch company Royal Philips announced Tuesday that it has received FDA approval for a new model ventilator that will be produced at Philips Respironics’ facilities in New Kensington and&nbsp;Murrysville.</p>
<p>In a release, the company describes the new Philips Respironics E30 ventilator as “a versatile and easy-to-use non-invasive and invasive ventilator which has been designed for large scale production.”</p>
<p>Philips Respironics officials plan to produce 15,000 E30 units per week as a complement to ramped-up production of 4,000 hospital ventilators per week.</p>
<p>The E30 ventilators will be for emergency use “to fill the critical hospital ventilation shortage,” the company said, adding that they “can be safely used when there is limited access to a fully featured critical care ventilator.”</p>
<p>Royal Philips officials said in a release that they received FDA approval for use of the E30 model in the U.S. on April 8 under the Emergency Use Authorization powers that allow expedited approval during a public health emergency. The company also said it “is working with the relevant regulatory authorities to also distribute the device globally.”</p>
<p>They say the scarce ventilators “should be made available across the world using a fair and ethical approach” based on COVID-19 numbers and a region’s “available critical care capacity.” That may include delivering batches of ventilators in phases so multiple areas can get them simultaneously.</p>
<p>“In line with Philips’ mission, we are fully committed to helping as many healthcare providers as possible diagnose, treat and monitor the growing numbers of COVID-19 patients,” said Royal Philips CEO Frans van Houten.</p>
