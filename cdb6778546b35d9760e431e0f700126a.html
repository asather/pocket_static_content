<h1>Recruiting contact tracers </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania has a significant shortage of coronavirus contact tracers. What few there are — mostly employees of nonprofits, government agencies or civilian volunteers — have been organized into patchwork brigades at the state and county level.</p>
<p>Among those volunteering their services are college students. A few Pennsylvania colleges are already training students as contact tracers to work regionally with public health officials. Pennsylvania, which is in need of hundreds more contact tracers, should look to partner with colleges to recruit from this demographic.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf and state Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine both said strong contact tracing systems are critical to reopening the state and containing the spread of the coronavirus. Contact tracing is the process of finding out who has been in close contact with an infected person, then letting those people know they may have been exposed and guiding them on what to do next, usually self-isolating.</p>
<p>As of mid-June, the state said it has employed 500 trained contact tracers, among them 130 nurses. It reported hundreds have volunteered through the ServPA platform, AmeriCorps and “other community organizations.” But there’s still a shortage.</p>
<p>Experts estimate that anywhere between 2,000 to 4,000 tracers are needed immediately. Allegheny County has 14 tracers but needs 183. Philadelphia County needs the most tracers — 674 — but only has 12.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf proposed creating a Commonwealth Civilian Coronavirus Corps more than a month ago, but there has been little movement in setting up the program that is supposed to train some of the nearly 2 million currently unemployed residents to help with contact tracing.</p>
<p>Two colleges have gotten involved in the haphazard system that’s emerged. Temple University created a contact tracing certificate program and is training more than 200 students to work with public health officials in eastern Pennsylvania. Penn State University medical students have been working on their school’s Contact Tracing Task Force in the central part of the state since March. An additional 40 public health science students are working with state public health nurses in the south-central region.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania should implement formal partnerships with more state colleges to train students in contact tracing. Such a partnership has the potential to be beneficial both for the state and for students. The state could save money on paying full-time contact tracers. Students could claim their time tracing as a work study or, if the student is studying in a relevant field, internship credit.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that students alone could meet every county’s need for contact tracing. But making an effort to recruit from this demographic would be relatively easy, based on the examples Penn State and Temple have set. Doing so would provide Pennsylvania public health workers with significantly more assistance than what they have now.</p>
