<h1>Holocaust knowledge limited, survey says. Some teachers aim to change that.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>About 14 years ago, Shaler Area High School social studies teacher Nick Haberman brought a Holocaust survivor,&nbsp;Jack Sittsamer, to speak to his students about his ordeal in Nazi-run concentration camps during World War II.</p>
<p>Mr. Haberman recalled Mr. Sittsamer telling him:&nbsp;“I’m going to die soon, and when I do, it’s up to you to tell my story.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2008/10/27/Obituary-Jack-Sittsamer-100-000-heard-his-account-of-Holocaust-s-horrors/stories/200810270176" target="_blank">Mr. Sittsamer died in 2008, having told his story to an estimated 100,000 students and others.</a></p>
<p>Since then, Mr. Haberman has taken his words to heart.&nbsp;He teaches elective courses on the Holocaust and related topics such as genocide and human rights —&nbsp;and helps other teachers do the same.</p>
<p>But the results of a recent survey show he and fellow educators have their work cut out for them.</p>
<p>Only 31 percent of young adults in this state show even a basic knowledge of the Holocaust —&nbsp;and even so, Pennsylvania was tied for fifth among the best-informed states. In no state did the percentage approach 50 percent, and the lowest-performing states were below 20 percent.</p>
<p>The survey, commissioned by the&nbsp;Conference on&nbsp;Jewish Material Claims Against Germany and conducted by Schoen Cooperman Research, echoes earlier studies about strikingly low levels of Holocaust knowledge among the overall populations of the United States and other Western countries. This one focuses on adults 18-39.</p>
<p>The survey defines those with “Holocaust knowledge” as meeting three criteria: 1) Definitely having heard of the Holocaust, 2) being able to identify a Nazi-run concentration camp or ghetto and 3) being able accurately to identify the death toll of 6 million Jews. Most respondents had heard of the Holocaust, but response rates were low for the other two questions.</p>
<p>“As&nbsp;Pennsylvania is in the top 10 and still with an alarmingly low success rate on that survey, it’s disheartening, but as a teacher it’s very motivating and makes me and many other teachers want to do more,” Mr. Haberman said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum defines the World War II-era genocide as “the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its allies and collaborators.”</p>
<p>Gideon Taylor, president of the Claims Conference,&nbsp;took heart that 80 percent of respondents thought it was important to teach about the Holocaust so it doesn’t happen again.&nbsp;“We have a problem, but we also have a desire to address that problem,” he said.</p>
<p>He said the survey question on the names of death camps was crafted not in expectation of scholarly knowledge among the public. But he hoped people would at least be able to name the Auschwitz camp.</p>
<p>“Auschwitz is a symbol of humanity’s depravity that is without parallel,” Mr. Taylor said.&nbsp;“Symbols are important. It’s disturbing that something&nbsp;like Auschwitz was ceasing to be a universal symbol.”</p>
<p>The survey found that half of young adults had seen Nazi symbols in their communities or social media feeds and had encountered social media posts denying the Holocaust or downplaying its enormity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of that propaganda may be having a “disturbing” effect, the Claims Conference reported. While most respondents accurately attributed the cause of the Holocaust to&nbsp;Germany’s Nazi regime, 10 percent identified the Jews themselves as the cause.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Act 70, which “strongly encourages” teaching about the Holocaust, genocide and human rights violations. It also encouraged study of genocides in Rwanda and other lands. The legislation, signed by then-Gov. Tom Corbett, cited the “potential consequences of unchecked ignorance, discrimination and persecution.” While not mandating the instruction, it required the Department of Education to provide resources and training on these topics for teachers.</p>
<p>A follow-up state survey in 2017 found that 90 percent of school districts and other school entities reported teaching units on these topics, some devoting substantial hours to them, but the survey did not evaluate the quality of the curriculums used. Hundreds of teachers have taken part in trainings on the topic.</p>
<p>But Mr. Haberman said it’s hard to square the results of that survey, based on schools’ self-reporting, with the results of the Claims Conference survey.</p>
<p>“There’s a difference between Holocaust education and quality Holocaust education,” he said.</p>
<p>The Allegheny Intermediate Unit offers teacher trainings with a goal&nbsp;“to really saturate Western Pennsylvania with knowledge of the Holocaust, human rights and genocide,” said Paul Cindric, program director for curriculum, instruction and professional education at AIU. “Our commitment to that continues.”</p>
<p>“There were a lot of teachers and districts that have already incorporated the Holocaust into their curriculum,” he said. “They&nbsp;were coming to augment what they already knew.”</p>
<p>Such trainings are an ongoing effort.</p>
<p>“It’s not enough to train new teachers; you have to train experienced teachers who are beginning to teach about the Holocaust,” said Lauren Bairnsfather, director of the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh, which has been active in teacher trainings.</p>
<p>Holocaust lessons offer cautionary tales for today, she said. While it’s important that they honor the victims’ memory, “it’s equally important to understand that quote-unquote normal people did this, allowed this to happen,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Haberman also founded and directs the LIGHT Education Initiative, taking root in several school districts. Its mission is&nbsp;“to inspire, prepare, and empower students for leadership roles in Holocaust, genocide, and human rights education, remembrance, and advocacy.” Shaler Area students, for example, held programs to mark Indigenous People’s Day and commemorate the 11 victims of the Oct. 27, 2018, anti-Semitic attack at the Tree of Life/Or L’Simcha synagogue in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools teaches on the Holocaust at multiple levels, beginning with a fifth grade reading assignment and continuing in earnest at various middle- and high school courses in both language arts and history. Students read first-person accounts of the Holocaust such as&nbsp;“The Diary of a Young Girl” by Anne Frank and&nbsp;“Night” by Elie Wiesel, study the Holocaust in the context of World War II and go on field trips to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial and Museum, and they have heard talks by Holocaust survivors.</p>
<p>“I’m really hoping it is prompting some kind of active citizenship among our students, that they’re starting to speak on human rights, really taking an active role in making sure something like this doesn’t happen again,” said Ann Fillmore, executive director for K-12 literacy and library services for Pittsburgh Public Schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scott Vensel, who teaches language arts at Dorseyville Middle School in the Fox Chapel Area School District, said students have been able to connect history with current events. The school hosted a talk by Judah Samet, a Holocaust survivor and Tree of Life member who narrowly avoided the Oct. 27, 2018, attack there. His life story draws a direct line from historic to current anti-Semitism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The students&nbsp;“really put the pieces together that it’s not just a story in a book, it’s something in our world,” Mr. Vensel said.</p>
<p>Thomas Ralston, superintendent at the Avonworth School District, said students in his district did a project on the 1939 episode of the ocean liner St. Louis, filled with Jewish refugees who were denied entry into the United States. Many later perished in death camps.</p>
<p>The students, he said,&nbsp;“drew a parallel to what was happening to the St. Louis to what was happening at the southern border” with the recent U.S. crackdown on asylum seekers.</p>
<p>Molly Long, a social studies teacher at Avonworth High School, said students are particularly moved when they hear stories from Holocaust survivors&nbsp;—&nbsp;“not looking at the statistics, but looking at the names and their stories, because then it becomes personal.”</p>
<p>Maintaining those personal stories will be increasingly challenging as the last generation of Holocaust survivors passes, teachers say.</p>
<p>“We’ve been fortunate to have children of survivors” give talks, said Mr. Vensel. “That can be the next step.”</p>
