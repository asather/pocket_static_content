<h1>II-VI shifted manufacturing outside China as new cases of coronavirus soared</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The coronavirus that began spreading ferociously in China in the last few months forced a Butler County electronic component maker to move quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>II-VI Inc., which employs nearly half of its 24,000-member workforce in China where factories were staying closed to avoid spreading the newly named Covid-19 virus, shifted manufacturing work to factories in Malaysia and Vietnam, and kept its supply chain officials working — from home — through the Chinese New Year holiday, with government approval.</p>
<p>“We have a real good command of the supply chain, and a little bit less than 50% of our total supply chain is inside China,” CEO Vincent D. Mattera said during an investors’ call earlier this week, “and we’ve done that, in part, to balance and mitigate the risks.”</p>
<p>II-VI also joined Facebook, Apple and other tech companies in avoiding all nonessential travel to China, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation and a painful blow for companies that depend on the world’s factory floor for parts used in consumer products ranging from iPhones and iPads to Amazon’s Kindle and Sony’s PlayStation.</p>
<p>II-VI, a Saxonburg-based engineered materials and electronic component maker, is smarting too, with officials warning this week that the outbreak will cut next quarter’s revenues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The effects are potentially broad-reaching,” CFO Mary Jane Raymond told investors Monday. “Not only are our many of our factories and employees dealing with a longer Chinese New Year holiday, there are also potential effects on the overall supply chain.”</p>
<p>At the same time, the company’s life sciences arm is making equipment used in deciphering virus DNA —&nbsp;a step in developing effective vaccines</p>
<p>China extended its New Year holidays three days to Feb. 2 and kept most businesses shut afterwards to contain the outbreak, which has sickened more than 44,653 people and killed more than 1,100. The outbreak was first clustered in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, but has since spread to a dozen other countries, including the U.S.</p>
<p>Citing health concerns, tech giants Ericsson, Sony, Amazon, Facebook and others pulled out of the World Mobile Congress, an annual trade show where new products are showcased. The event, which ordinarily attracts 2,400 companies, was canceled Wednesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, electronics giant and iPhone maker Foxconn has suspended operations at its Shenzhen headquarters as virus fears&nbsp;spread beyond the tech industry to Honda Motor Co., which has three plants in Wuhan, and Toyota Motor Corp.’s joint venture factories —&nbsp;all off-line until at least Feb. 17.</p>
<p>II-VI has no operations in Hubei Province, but isn’t immune to the virus fallout.</p>
<p>The company is bracing for a $50 million revenue hit to sales in the third quarter — about 8% or 9% of total anticipated revenue — Ms. Raymond told investors.</p>
<p>Mr. Mattera counseled patience in the face of difficult times.&nbsp;“This is not a one-quarter game for us,” he told investors. “It’s a long game.”</p>
<p>II-VI doubled its workforce to 24,000 people with the acquisition in September of Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Finisar Corp., a data storage and 3D sensing system manufacturer. Between 45% and 50% of II-VI’s workforce is in China, including its regional headquarters in Fuzhou.</p>
<p>The Finisar acquisition created a $2.5 billion company, which is expected to give II-VI three to five times its current operating capacity within three years, Mr. Mattera said.</p>
<p>Ms. Raymond told investors that one-third of the company’s workforce returned to work Monday and the rest were expected back by mid-March. But Jed Dorsheimer, an analyst at Toronto, Canada-based investment banker Canaccord Genuity Inc., said the return date may be optimistic.</p>
<p>“The view that they would be back to work by mid-March strikes us as optimistic given recent commentary from China’s President Xi Jinping,” Mr. Dorsheimer wrote in a note to investors. “However, without more to go on at this time, we are modeling accordingly, but intend to watch this closely over the coming weeks/months.”</p>
<p>China accounts for 14% of II-VI’s sales. Japan accounts for another 8% of sales and the rest of Asia makes up 14% of sales, Mr. Mattera told investors. U.S. shipments account for 39% of sales.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses comprise a large family of viruses that are common in a variety of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats, according to the CDC. Animal coronaviruses rarely infect people then spread between people the way this new coronavirus does.</p>
