<h1>Health department investigates Mon Valley pollution</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On a day when the North Braddock air monitor measured elevated sulfur dioxide levels in the Monongahela Valley, the Allegheny County Health Department also announced that it was investigating a June 17 emissions plume from the U.S. Steel Corp.’s Edgar Thomson Works.</p>
<p>The department said that “it received many questions and concerns regarding an emission plume” observed at the Braddock steel mill that evening.</p>
<p>U.S. Steel officials explained “that a valve failed to open during the startup of a blast furnace after being shut down for routine maintenance.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 2 a.m. Thursday, the North Braddock monitor measured hourly sulfur dioxide levels of 0.079 parts per million, which exceeded the federal hourly limit of 0.075 ppm.</p>
<p>The Health Department said in a news release that it also was “investigating this potential exceedance, including verifying the data.”</p>
