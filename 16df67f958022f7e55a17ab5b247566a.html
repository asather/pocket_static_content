<h1>Ryan Switzer, Daniel McCullers among cuts as Steelers trim roster to 53</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers cut their roster from 80 to 53 players Saturday afternoon, and there were only a few mild surprises.</p>
<p>The team released receiver <strong>Ryan Switzer</strong> and veteran defensive tackle <strong>Daniel McCullers</strong>. They also cut sixth-round draft pick <strong>Antoine Brooks</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to Switzer and McCullers, the Steelers released five other players that were on the 53-man roster last season, including running backs <strong>Kerrith Whyte</strong> and <strong>Trey Edmunds</strong>; quarterback <strong>Paxton Lynch</strong>; outside linebacker <strong>Tuzar Skipper</strong>; and receiver <strong>Deon Cain</strong>.</p>
<p>Switzer was acquired by the Steelers in a trade with the Raiders in 2018. In two seasons with the Steelers he had 44 receptions for 280 yards and one touchdown. He also served as the punt and kickoff returner for part of his tenure.</p>
<p>The Steelers kept Ray-Ray McCloud over Switzer. McCloud played in 16 games over the past two seasons with the Bills and Panthers and has five career receptions for 36 yards. It appears he will be the primary kickoff returner. He averaged 21.8 yards-per-return for the Panthers last season.</p>
<p>McCloud was not signed by the Steelers until midway through training camp last month, but he was a consistent standout during practices at Heinz Field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>McCullers, a sixth-round pick in 2014, was beaten out by rookie seventh-round pick Carlos Davis. In 73 games over six seasons, McCullers recorded 2½ sacks and 41 tackles.</p>
<p>Brooks, a Maryland product who was vying for a job in the secondary, was beaten out for a spot by undrafted free agent cornerback James Pierre, the only rookie undrafted free agent to make the initial 53-man roster.</p>
<p>The initial 53-man roster for the Steelers includes five receivers, five running backs, three quarterbacks, three tight ends and nine offensive linemen.</p>
<p>With starting right guard David DeCastro on the mend from a lower-body injury, the Steelers elected to keep two interior line reserves in Stefen Wisniewski and J.C. Hassenauer. Both are capable of playing guard and center, although coach Mike Tomlin said Friday that DeCastro is expected to practice at some point next week in advance of the season opener against the Giants.</p>
<p>The roster also includes six defensive linemen, four outside linebackers, five inside linebackers and 10 defensive backs.</p>
<p>Pierre, a 6-foot-2, 185-pound prospect out of Florida Atlantic, had an impressive training camp. He is one of six cornerbacks on the roster along with four safeties.</p>
<p>The Steelers also released running back <strong>Wendell Smallwood</strong>; receivers <strong>Saeed Blacknall, DeAndre Thompkins</strong> and <strong>Amara Darboh</strong>; tight ends <strong>Kevin Rader</strong> and <strong>Kyle Markway</strong>; offensive linemen <strong>Christian DiLauro, John Keenoy, Derwin Gray, Anthony Coyle</strong> and <strong>Jarron Jones</strong>; defensive lineman <strong>Cavon Walker, Henry Mondeaux</strong> and <strong>Calvin Taylor</strong>; outside linebacker <strong>Jayrone Elliott</strong>; defensive backs <strong>Trajan Bandy</strong> and <strong>John Battle</strong>; punter <strong>Corliss Waitman</strong>; and long snapper <strong>Liam McCullough</strong>.</p>
<p>The Steelers enter the regular season with the same three specialists as last season: place kicker Chris Boswell, punter Jordan Berry and long snapper Kameron Canaday.</p>
<p>The Steelers will sign 16 players to their practice squad beginning Sunday. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are amended rules for the practice squad this year. Teams can sign as many as 16 players to their practice squads, and that can include six veterans.</p>
<p>That would give players such as McCullers and Switzer opportunities to remain with the team. There also are new rules for call-ups to the 53-man roster. Teams can call up two players from the practice squad on game days, and those players will not be subject to clearing waivers.</p>
<p>It’s important to note the roster set Saturday afternoon is not likely to be the roster the Steelers take into the season opener against the Giants. The Steelers will be scouring the waiver wire to see if there are any players that will improve their team.</p>
<p>The Steelers began the day by creating $3.85 million in cap space by converting DeCastro’s base salary for this season into a signing bonus, according to Field Yates of ESPN. The move gives the Steelers some flexibility with the cap during the season.</p>
