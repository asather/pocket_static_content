<h1>The Dribbler: Time to crown the WPIAL's best in basketball</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This is The Dribbler’s favorite weekend of the year.</p>
<p>It’s the weekend he gets to hang out at his buddy Pete’s place.</p>
<p>Chilling there is always a good time. There are fun things to do year round, but this is a special couple of days. From Thursday through Saturday, the two will have a high school basketball marathon, taking in 12 WPIAL championship games. They’ll have the best seats in the house, too, leaning back in a couple of La-Z-Boys that will be placed courtside.</p>
<p>Because it’s the big stage, Pete and The Dribbler are hoping to view a cinematic masterpiece or two. They have seen some thrilling finishes in recent years, like when Dylan Stapleton found brother Riley for the winning basket that pushed Indiana over Beaver Falls. And how can they forget North Catholic’s Tess Myers driving the length of the court and knocking down the winning jumper to beat Beaver.</p>
<p>These are experiences The Dribbler eats up. Oh, and they’ll do a lot of eating, as well. One of the benefits of knowing Pete is unlimited nachos and hot dogs all weekend long, and at no charge.</p>
<p>It’s the biggest event in Pittsburgh-area high school basketball. Let’s crown some champ-yinz.</p>
<p>The Dribbler went 4-4 last week to move his season record to 55-33 (.625).</p>
<p>Here are his thoughts on the WPIAL championships (all games will be played at Petersen Events Center):</p>
<p><strong>Boys</strong></p>
<p><strong>6A: But­ler vs. Mt. Leb­a­non, 9 p.m. Satur­day</strong> — But­ler climbed a moun­tain in com­ing back from late def­i­cits to grab over­time wins in the quar­ter­fi­nals and semi­fi­nals. Now it must try to scale de­fend­ing cham­pion Mt. Leb­a­non. The Blue Devils un­ques­tion­ably have the tal­ent to win this game. How­ever, at this point, it wouldn’t be wise to pick against Ethan Mor­ton. <strong>Win­ner: But­ler.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5A: Laurel Highlands vs. Mars, 9 p.m. Friday</strong> — For those of you who have seen Rodney Gallagher play and say he’s “out of this world,” you’re right — he’s about to land on Mars. You’ve got Gallagher, Laurel Highlands’ star freshman point guard, going up against Mars’ Michael Carmody, the 6-foot-7, 290-pound Notre Dame football recruit. The Dribbler has a feeling … <strong>Winner: Laurel Highlands.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4A: High­lands vs. Belle Ver­non, 1 p.m. Satur­day</strong> — How about those Belle Ver­non Leop­ards? Not since Beauty and the Beast has a Belle looked this good. What was more im­pres­sive, the up­set of Quaker Val­ley or New Cas­tle? If they beat High­lands, they might as well put up stat­ues of Joe Salvino and Devin Whit­lock. It won’t hap­pen. High­lands’ Johnny Crise will shine. <strong>Win­ner: High­lands.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3A: Lincoln Park vs. North Catholic, 9 p.m. Thursday</strong> — This just in: Lincoln Park just shot two more free throws. Perhaps the wildest stat from the semifinals was that the Leopards went to the line 42 times against Aliquippa. They made 31. Speaking of 31, North Catholic could get that many from Isaac DeGregorio. He’s destined for a big game. North Catholic is very good, but Lincoln Park has too many weapons. <strong>Winner: Lincoln Park.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2A: Our Lady of the Sacred Heart vs. Sto-Rox, 5 p.m. Friday</strong> — This is even better than any Chargers-Vikings matchup the NFL could produce. It’s wild to think that it’s been 18 years since Sto-Rox last won a title. Many seasons, this team would be the favorite. But not this season, not against OLSH’s stud guard tandem of Jake DiMichele and Dante Spadafora, who will make it back-to-back titles. <strong>Winner: OLSH.</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>1A: Vincentian vs. Cornell, 7 p.m. Thursday</strong> — </strong>The Dribbler wonders if John Calipari will be in the house for this one. His high school coach, Bill Sacco, has guided Cornell to the final for the first time since 2012. It has been 20 years since the Raiders last won a title, but they know they’ve got a shot against a Vincentian team they beat a few weeks ago. Vincentian’s size will be the difference. Angelo Reeves and friends will get it done.<strong> <strong>Winner: Vincentian.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Girls</strong></p>
<p><strong>6A: Bethel Park vs. North Allegheny, 7 p.m. Saturday</strong> — Bethel Park’s Maddie Dziezgowski is one of the best players in the WPIAL. Her last name is also one of the hardest to spell. Luckily for North Allegheny, only one of those things could potentially be a problem for the Tigers. These are two terrific defensive teams, and it’s unlikely either team will reach 40. In a toss-up … <strong>Winner: North Allegheny.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5A: Chart­iers Val­ley vs. Trin­ity, 3 p.m. Satur­day</strong> — The Drib­bler would like to poll the McCon­nell fam­ily to see who each is root­ing for in this game. Is it Tim, who has guided Chart­iers Valley to 54 wins in a row? Or Kathy, who has Trin­ity on the door­step of its first ti­tle in her first sea­son as coach? Trin­ity knows it can play with the Colts, but it’s hard to pick against “the streak.” <strong>Win­ner: Chart­iers Val­ley.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4A: North Catholic vs. Southmoreland, 7 p.m. Friday</strong> — Unbeaten Southmoreland is nicknamed the Scotties. Scottie is short for Scottish Terrier. At this point, their logo might be better off replaced by a picture of Rodney Dangerfield. The Dribbler believes the Scotties are getting no respect. The Dribbler, for one, believes in them, but he just can’t see them beating North Catholic. <strong>Winner: North Catholic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3A: Beaver vs. Mo­hawk, 11 a.m. Satur­day</strong> — Beaver star Emma Pavelek has an aunt who was once on “Sur­vi­vor.” The Drib­bler was a sur­vi­vor once, as in he sur­vived a mo­hawk hair­cut given to him by his older cousin, The Fum­bler. He hates to think about that mo­hawk, but he re­ally likes this Mo­hawk team. The War­riors can flat-out shoot it. A first WPIAL ti­tle is on the way. <strong>Win­ner: Mo­hawk.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2A: Laurel vs. Bishop Canevin, 5 p.m. Thursday</strong> — Laurel is about to play for a WPIAL title for the first time. As the No. 4 seed, the odds were against the Spartans getting here, but having Faith surely helped. Faith Gibson is their starting point guard. She doesn’t own the best name on the team, though. That belongs to freshman Georgia Jellyman. Canevin is very talented and has become a title game regular. This is the Upset Special. <strong>Winner: Laurel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1A: Rochester vs. West Greene, 3 p.m. Friday</strong> — The Dribbler was a little disappointed Clairton didn’t beat Rochester in the semifinals. That kept us from seeing Clairton’s Jerzee Sutton playing against West Greene’s Jersey Wise. There’s a reason Rochester won — the Rams are really good. But so is unbeaten West Greene. The teams are a combined 47-1. <strong>Winner: Rochester.</strong></p>
