<p>A former Continental Can plant in West Mifflin has been sold to a Milwaukee real estate firm that is promising major upgrades.</p>
<p>An affiliate of Phoenix Investors, a Wisconsin-based commercial real estate company that specializes in revitalizing former manufacturing properties, paid $10 million to acquire the South Hills Industrial Park at 1200 Lebanon Road in West Mifflin.</p>
<p>The 625,000-square-foot facility is now about 74% leased and home to 18 tenants, including Matthews International, Beacon Roofing Supply, Coffee Tree Roasters and Operation Troop Appreciation.</p>
<p>John Jackson, a senior vice president at Cushman &amp; Wakefield/Grant Street Associates who represented the seller, Specialty Group Industries, in the transaction, said he and his colleague Evan Cicirello connected with Phoenix when they began marketing the property.</p>
<p>“It’s their bread and butter. This is what they do. They own a lot of assets like this around the country,” he said.</p>
<p>The property proved to be attractive to Phoenix because it is close to Pittsburgh and only a few minutes from the Allegheny County Airport in West Mifflin, he added.</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson said Phoenix will be injecting “a significant amount of capital” into the facility in order to improve it. He did not know the exact amount.</p>
<p>In addition to the massive facility itself, Phoenix acquired an additional 14 acres of developable land.</p>
<p>“We will implement numerous capital and cosmetic improvements to the property in short order,” Anthony Crivello, Phoenix executive vice president, said in a statement. “The property will be materially more attractive and functional to new users.”</p>
<p>Many of the current tenants have been there for years, Mr. Jackson said.</p>
<p>“[Phoenix officials] want to inject capital into the facility, not only to keep longtime tenants happy but to attract new tenants and fill up that vacancy,” he said.</p>
<p>The facility originally was built for Continental Can Company, which operated it for about 32 years into the early 1980s, according to former property manager Ted Malesky.</p>
<p>Continental manufactured cans at the location. It supplied cans to H.J. Heinz Co. and for Iron City Beer, he said. At one time, as many as 1,400 people worked at the Continental facility, he noted.</p>
<p>“Any size can you wanted, they made there,” he said.</p>
<p>Specialty Group purchased the property in 1986, according to Allegheny County property records.</p>
<p>Phoenix affiliate companies hold interests in about 29 million square feet of industrial, retail, office and single tenant net-leased properties in 23 states.</p>
