<p>A Baldwin man turned himself in Monday after Pittsburgh police charged him with vehicular homicide in the October death of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/10/23/austin-fike-bicycle-killed-brookline-pittsburgh/stories/201910230157" target="_blank">22-year-old Austin Fike</a>, who was struck by a drunk driver while riding his bike&nbsp;in Brookline. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office ruled Mr. Fike’s death an accident, but on Tuesday, police charged Thomas W. Morton, 23, with&nbsp;two counts of driving under the influence, two felony counts of homicide by vehicle, accidents involving death while not licensed, involuntary manslaughter, driving on the wrong side of the road, and other traffic violations.</p>
<p>Authorities responded just after 9 p.m. on Oct. 20 to the accident at the&nbsp;intersection of Brookline Boulevard and Pioneer Avenue.&nbsp;Mr. Morton was driving a silver 2004 Honda Civic Coupe westbound on Brookline Boulevard when he made a left turn into the path of the black Schwinn motorbike that Mr. Fike was riding, a criminal complaint said. Mr. Fike was headed east on the same street.</p>
<p>Mr. Fike was taken to UPMC Mercy Hospital in critical condition, and later died of injuries to his head, according to the medical examiner.&nbsp;Mr. Morton and a front-seat passenger were not injured, a complaint said.</p>
<p>The front bumper and hood of Mr. Morton's car was damaged in the crash, police said. The front fork of Mr. Fike's bike was twisted and distorted.</p>
<p>Mr. Morton did not possess a valid driver's license and had only a state identification card. His blood alcohol content was .121% — a few points over the state legal limit of .08%, a complaint said.</p>
<p>He had "glassy, watery eyes" and slurred speech, police said.</p>
<p>A witness who had stopped that night at a red light in the left turning lane on Pioneer Avenue provided police dash cam footage of the accident.&nbsp;The witness told police they saw Mr. Fike's body flip several times in the air after his bike was struck.</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Fike did not appear to be going fast, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Police said they viewed the footage, and saw that Mr. Morton was on the opposite side of the road in oncoming traffic, as well as in the travel path of Mr. Fike's bike.&nbsp;A Mount Washington native, Mr. Fike had worked since March at Bigham Tavern and had recently acquired his bike to travel to and from work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for Jan. 17.</p>
