You have to be able to stop it.”</p><p>Belle Vernon (7-4, 1-1) couldn’t, but that’s been a problem for most of Uniontown’s opponents. The Red Raiders, ranked No. 5 in the class, improved to 7-1 (2-0 in section) by winning their 13th consecutive section game and 11th in a row home game.</p><p>Playing for the first time in nearly two weeks — it previously played Dec. 21 in a tournament in Florida — Uniontown didn’t show much rust. In fact, the 81 points were a season high. The Red Raiders led, 46-29, at the half, and limited Belle Vernon to just seven points in the third quarter. The lead ballooned to as many as 29 points by early in the fourth quarter.</p><p>“We’ve been practicing every day since we came back from Florida, so we were ready,” said senior guard Billy DeShields, the team’s leading scorer at 19 points per game.</p><p>Not only did Uniontown show off its athleticism, but it also showed off its balance. Six players scored at least nine points, with DeShields, Isaiah Melvin and Ray Robinson each tallying 17. Robinson made five 3-pointers. Freshman Keondre DeShields, Billy’s brother, scored 10, while Richardson and Bryant Grady added nine apiece.</p><p>Melvin and Richardson are both springy seniors who looked like they might hit their heads off the rim. Billy DeShields said the two sometimes put on slam dunk contests at practice. Who is better? Edge to Richardson, according to DeShields.</p><p>“He showed you a two-hand dunk tonight, but he can do some crazy things. Windmills, 360s, he can do it,” DeShields said.</p><p>Uniontown’s five starters also started on last season’s team that won 19 games before losing in the WPIAL quarterfinals for the second year in a row. With so much experience back and with it being their final opportunity, DeShields said he and his classmates are thinking big. Uniontown’s most recent WPIAL title came in 2002.</p><p>“The goal is definitely a WPIAL title,” said DeShields. “First we have to win the section. That’s the first goal. And then as soon as that happens, then it’s automatically the WPIAL. That’s the long-term goal.”</p><p>Belle Vernon sophomore guard Devin Whitlock, who came into the night averaging 20 points a game, was held to a season-low 11. Cam Nusser and Thomas Hepple each chipped in 10.</p><p>Despite the loss, Belle Vernon is in a much better spot than last season, Salvino’s first after 34 seasons at Monessen. The Leopards started 2-12 and went on to finish 8-15. Uniontown handed the Leopards their worst two losses of the season, by 49 and 44 points.</p><p>“We’ve made great strides, don’t get me wrong,” said Salvino, who has 653 career wins. “but we want to get to that point that we are playing with Uniontown and some of the better teams.”</p><p>That definitely wasn’t the case Friday.</p><p><em>Brad Everett: beverett@post-gazette.com and Twitter @BREAL412.</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/01/03/WPIAL-Class-4A-Section-3-Uniontown-dominates-in-81-54-win-against-Belle-Vernon/stories/202001030152</original_url>
