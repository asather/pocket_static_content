<h1>Felony charges reduced in Jefferson County deer-torture case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Jefferson County deer torture incident that made national headlines in November came to a resolution Monday. Felony charges for aggravated cruelty to animals were dropped when one of the suspects, Alexander Smith, 19, of Brookville, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and four summary offenses.</p>
<p>Information was not available concerning a 17-year-old male defendant also implicated in the case who was charged as a juvenile.</p>
<p>The teens had been hunting together Nov. 30 in a tree stand on Jefferson County property owned by the family of Mr. Smith, the stepson of the Brookville police chief. The juvenile shot and wounded the buck, then missed with a follow-up shot. While the deer was immobilized, they recorded a video showing them kicking the deer and tearing off its antlers. They shared the video through the messaging app Snapchat and it spread around the world, inspiring news reports and many replies from viewers who found the images repugnant.</p>
<p>A recipient saved the video and shared it with the Pennsylvania Game Commission, which filed charges including two felony counts of aggravated animal cruelty and two felony counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated animal cruelty, as well as additional misdemeanor and summary counts.</p>
<p>The Jefferson County Clerk of Courts reported Monday that Mr. Smith reached a plea deal. He was sentenced to probation, 200 hours of community service and fines totaling $2,150. His hunting license was suspended through 2035, and for two years he must be available to speak at hunting safety classes and to school groups.</p>
<p>Jefferson County District Attorney Jeff Burkett said in a statement that although the video was “repulsive,” sentencing guidelines forced the dropping of felony charges.</p>
