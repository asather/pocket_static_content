<h1>Pitt guard Ryan Murphy to leave the program as a graduate transfer</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While much of the United States stands still, the transfer portal in college basketball, as it is wont to do, remains active.</p>
<p>On Sunday, it added a player from Pitt, as junior guard Ryan Murphy will graduate and transfer after one season with the program.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-2 Murphy averaged 7.6 points per game and shot 33.1% from the 3-point range during the 2019-20 campaign. His 3-point percentage led all Pitt players who had at least 10 attempts on the season. He appeared in 30 of the Panthers’ 33 games, starting in 12 of them.</p>
<p>The athletic department confirmed his departure Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>“We appreciate Ryan’s efforts with our program this season and wish him luck as he looks to continue his playing career elsewhere,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said in a statement.</p>
<p>As a graduate transfer, Murphy will be immediately eligible wherever it is he opts to enroll. Without him on the roster, Capel will now have two open scholarship with which to work, as his team has signed three freshmen, but is losing Murphy, as well as forwards Eric Hamilton, Kene Chukwuka and Samson George, all of whom took part in the team’s senior day last month (George is the only non-senior or graduate transfer of that group).</p>
<p>A native of Calabasas, Calif., Murphy arrived at Pitt via New Mexico Junior College, where he spent one season. Prior to that, he played his freshman season at Charlotte, where he averaged 6.7 points per game and shot 40% from 3 before suffering a broken foot.</p>
<p>Coming into the season, Murphy was praised by teammates and coaches alike for his outside shooting, something the Panthers badly needed following the graduation of Jared Wilson-Frame. For much of the first half of the season, he largely fulfilled that role. In his first 21 games with the program, he averaged 10.1 points per game and shot 35.3% from 3, emerging as a capable complementary scorer on a team still very much carried by the backcourt of Xavier Johnson and Trey McGowens, along with standout freshman Justin Champagnie. That stretch saw 11 double-figure scoring performances, including a career-high 28 points in a Nov. 9 loss against Nicholls State and 11 points in a 74-72 victory against Boston College on Jan. 22 in which he made the winning jumper with four seconds remaining.</p>
<p>The trajectory of Murphy’s season changed, however, in a Jan. 30 practice, when he suffered a concussion that sidelined him for the next three games. In the nine games he played after coming back from the injury, he averaged only 1.9 points per game and shot just 17.6% from 3.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just that his averages diminished -- his role on the team did, as well. In that final stretch, he averaged just 10.8 minutes per game, down from the 30.4 he had been averaging before then, and his prominence within the offense plummeted, as he went from 9.2 shot attempts per game in his first 21 games to 3.3 in his final nine.</p>
