<p>The sister of a late McKeesport City Council member will serve the remainder of her term.</p>
<p>Jill Lape was appointed to fill the council seat once occupied by her sister, Jamie Brewster-Filotei, 46, who died of cancer March 12.</p>
<p>Council voted to appoint Ms. Lape at its June 3 meeting.</p>
<p>Ms. Lape is a teacher at Twin Rivers Intermediate School in the McKeesport Area School District. Her term expires at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Council member LuEthel Nesbit was elected to assume Ms. Brewster-Filoetiâ€™s role as council vice president.</p>
<p>In other matters, council approved the application for Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding through the U.S. Department of Justice and office of Justice Programs.</p>
<p>If McKeesport is approved for the funding it would be used for assistance in preventing, preparing for and responding to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The government website says funding would include but is not limited to: overtime, equipment such as law enforcement and personal protective equipment, hiring, and purchasing supplies such as sanitizer, masks and gloves.</p>
