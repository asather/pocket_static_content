<h1>West Allegheny's Austin Hendrick selected in first round by Cincinnati Reds</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>West Allegheny High School senior Austin Hendrick played some all-star showcase games last summer for a team that was coached by a few Cincinnati Reds scouts. Soon, Hendrick will be playing for the Reds organization for real.</p>
<p>The Reds selected Hendrick Wednesday night in the first round of the Major League Baseball draft. Hendrick was the 12th overall pick. Projected as a right fielder, the left-handed hitting Hendrick is only the sixth player from a WPIAL school to be selected in the first round out of high school since the MLB June draft started in 1965.</p>
<p>Hendrick had signed last November with Mississippi State, but is expected to forego college and sign with the Reds. Under MLB’s slotted value system, Hendrick’s signing bonus from the Reds would be almost $4.5 million.</p>
<p>Hendrick watched the draft on ESPN Wednesday at his home with family and friends. He said he had an idea that the Reds liked him and several mock drafts had him going to the team in the neighboring state.</p>
<p>“It has been an unbelievable experience,” Hendrick said. “I’m super, super excited.”</p>
<p>Some draft analysts had called the 6-1, 205-pound Hendrick the best power hitter in the draft, college or high school. Hendrick was the third high school player taken in the first round.</p>
<p>“We had him higher than 12 on our board, so we were excited to get him,” said Brad Meador, the Reds’ director of amateur scouting.</p>
<p>Hendrick had been a starter for West Allegheny since his freshman year and made the Post-Gazette All-Area team as a sophomore. What’s interesting is that Hendrick did not even make all-section last year as a junior. The all-section teams are selected by the coaches.</p>
<p>But Hendrick had proven himself in summer all-star showcases and with travel teams. The Reds were impressed that Hendrick changed his swing last summer.</p>
<p>“We loved the power, loved the hitting tools,” said Dick Williams, Reds president of baseball operations.</p>
<p>Hendrick did not speak to the media for the past few months. But he did a Zoom meeting with media members Wednesday night. He apparently is back in talk mode.</p>
<p>“I just like to focus on me,” Hendrick said of his media blackout. “You see a lot of mock drafts, a lot of speculation and I just tried to stay away from a lot of that. I didn’t want to get my head into that and worry about that. For me, [not talking to the media] was the best way to keep my mind straight.”</p>
<p>Hendrick was one of two Pennsylvania high school players taken in the first round. Pitcher Nick Bitsko of Central Bucks East near Philadelphia was selected with the 24th pick by the Tampa Bay Rays. This is the first time since 2000 that two Pennsylvania high school players were selected in the first round.</p>
<p>Hendrick is the fourth player with WPIAL ties to be selected in the first round in the past six years. Ian Happ, a Mt. Lebanon graduate, was selected by the Chicago Cubs in 2015 out of the University of Cincinnati. Alex Kirilloff was picked by the Minnesota Twins out of Plum High School in 2016. Blackhawk graduate Brendan McKay was picked by the Tampa Bay Rays in 2017 out of Louisville.</p>
