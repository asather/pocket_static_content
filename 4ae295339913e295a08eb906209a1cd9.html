<h1>Paul Zeise: Coronavirus protocols are a work in progress but seem to be working</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Seemingly every day we read stories of athletes — mostly football players — returning to campus and a few are testing postive for COVID-19. There are some who seem shocked by this and are even saying it is a negative development.</p>
<p>I actually think the opposite is true. It isn’t a good thing that players are testing positive, but it is a good development that they are being tested. And they are being isolated and getting treatment while the teams continue to work out.</p>
<p>That tells me that the safety protocols put in place so far have been working. We all know it is likely that some athletes — and people from all walks of life — are bound to be COVID-19 positive. It shouldn’t be a surprise that a handful (or less) have seemingly tested positive at each one of these campuses. It should have been expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Athletes in their 20s are in the best shape of their life and at an extremely low risk of it becoming serious. Most have been asymptomatic, and the ones who have had symptoms have been extremely mild. The key is we are finding out who has the virus and they are being separated.</p>
<p>This is completely new territory for doctors and medical experts, and some of it is trial and error. But it is clear they are working hard to figure out how to make it work within the context of the pandemic. We all have to learn how to live with COVID-19 in the world, but especially athletes whose job puts them in close contact with others every time they take the field.</p>
<p>Much has been made about Ohio State asking players to sign a waiver that basically says they understand the risks involved with the coronavirus. It seems like a terrible policy, but if you read the fine print, it isn’t much different than a waiver saying players understand there are risks involved with playing a sport. And the really fine print that seems to be glossed over is this: players who opt out of signing the waiver can’t play but they keep their scholarship.</p>
<p>We have made a lot of progress on this in three months. We are a long way from worrying about shutting down a season if someone tests positive. We have miles still to go on all of this, but it seems clear to me that it will indeed be possible to have sports even with a pandemic going on.</p>
<p>Are there going to be missteps? Yes, absolutely. Some setbacks, too. And some flat out questionable decisions like the University of Houston opting not to test every player when they arrive on campus until they show symptoms. This has led to a mini-breakout at Houston and they have had to stop workouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That isn’t bad news, though, as the football season isn’t for another 10 weeks and every mistake made is something we can learn from. It is clear to me that every athlete needs to be tested before they are allowed to participate in team activities, and that’s for the safety of all.</p>
<p>All of this can be viewed as scary but probably should be viewed as progress. The more we learn about COVID-19, the better chance we have to learn how to live relatively normally with it. And that’s just something we will have to do. Experts have told us it isn’t realistic to believe we will have a vaccine for at least a year. There are some that are being pushed through and labs are in a hurry to find one and test it, but that’s not something we can count on.</p>
<p>The most important thing is safety and health of athletes. And what we are starting to see is that through proper testing and tracing, there might just be a pathway to playing sports and keeping everyone safe.</p>
<p>There are some asking questions. What happens during the season when there is an outbreak? How will that be handled? What will be the protocols? Will teams have to forfeit?</p>
<p>Nobody could know these answers because this is all new. Two months ago we were told there was no way students would be able to be on campus or teams would be working out. A few months ago, we were told we might not see sports at all this year, but we see baseball, soccer and golf all being played.</p>
<p>That means the experts have made progress and they continue to work through all of the issues. It isn’t perfect, but it will only get better as we continue to move forward. That’s why I don’t look at these headlines of some players testing positive as a negative but rather as a sign that the protocols being put in place are working.</p>
