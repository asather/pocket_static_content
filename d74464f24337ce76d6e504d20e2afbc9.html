<h1>Allegheny County council approves use of purple paint to designate no trespassing areas</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County Council on Tuesday approved the use of purple paint markings on trees to keep hunters from trespassing on private property.</p>
<p>The alternative to paper “No Hunting” and “No Trespassing” signs was already state law under Act 103 passed in November 2019, which allows three days a year of Sunday hunting.</p>
<p>But the state legislation doesn’t apply to first- and second-class counties — Philadelphia is the former, Allegheny is the latter — and requires local adoption.</p>
<p>The county ordinance, entitled “Offenses Against Property,” was passed on a 13-1 vote and enacted “to protect the property rights, health, safety and well-being of individuals within the county.”</p>
<p>To qualify as a trespassing notification the purple paint must be applied to trees or fence posts in 8-inch long, 1-inch-wide vertical strips, between 3 and 5 feet above ground level.</p>
