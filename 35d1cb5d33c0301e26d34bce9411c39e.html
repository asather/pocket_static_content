<h1>Police: Surveillance shows Aliquippa man driving away after 30-year-old shot and killed</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Aliquippa man accused of killing 30-year-old Tyric Pugh Friday night in Beaver County had gone for ice cream with Mr. Pugh earlier that day, and surveillance video also shows him leaving the scene shortly after the man was shot, police said.</p>
<p>But defense attorney Michael Santicola maintains his client’s innocence, and said the two are&nbsp;“good friends” and&nbsp;“have known each other their entire lives.”</p>
<p>Sheldon Jeter Jr. —&nbsp;who had romantic ties to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2018/05/17/Search-warrant-reveals-details-in-Aliquippa-teacher-s-slaying-Rachael-DelTondo-Sheldon-Jeter/stories/201805170181?cid=search" target="_blank">slain cyber schoolteacher and Aliquippa native Rachael DelTondo</a> — was arrested Sunday and charged with one count of homicide in the shooting death of Mr. Pugh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police responded around 11:41 p.m. Friday night to Kiehl Street in Aliquippa for report of a man lying in the roadway when they discovered Mr. Pugh had been shot several times.&nbsp;He was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.</p>
<p>Seven spent .38-caliber bullet casings were found on the ground near Mr. Pugh's body, police said in a criminal complaint. Authorities recovered his identification card and cellphone from his pockets, before visiting the address listed on Mr. Pugh’s ID in an attempt to reach family.</p>
<p>Once at the residence in the 100 block of Orchard Street in Aliquippa, police said they encountered Mr. Jeter, 22, who also lived at the residence. He confessed he was with Mr. Pugh earlier that day, but authorities said he gave contradictory statements regarding the time he left his home before Mr. Pugh was shot and the last time he was with him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Jeter and Mr. Pugh went to get ice cream early Friday evening at Bruster's Ice Cream in Hopewell with two other men, police said in the complaint. Surveillance footage also showed Mr. Jeter’s vehicle leaving Kiehl Street — where the shooting occurred — later that evening shortly after Mr. Pugh was killed Friday night.</p>
<p>In a search of Mr. Jeter’s home, police found a .38-caliber semi-automatic pistol and ammunition matching the empty shell casings found at the scene near Mr. Pugh's body, the criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Santicola, Mr. Jeter denies giving conflicting statements to police because he told them “everything he remembers” about that day.</p>
<p>“He didn’t even feel like he should be a suspect, because he gave them his phone, his clothes and let them swab him for gunshot residue,” Mr. Santicola said Monday.&nbsp;“I’m assuming they don’t have test results back on that. Our investigators are just starting.”</p>
<p>Witness testimonies, along with data from Mr. Jeter's cellphone and surveillance footage contradicted his statements to police regarding his whereabouts at the time of the shooting, the criminal complaint said. Police searched the vehicle that Mr. Jeter and Mr. Pugh were last seen riding in together, but it was unclear if any evidence was found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two were close, and Mr. Jeter’s grandfather even considered Mr. Pugh a son, Mr. Santicola said.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to come up with why someone would do this,” he said.&nbsp;“... Sheldon [Jeter] is the last person who would do this.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 13, 2018, Ms. DelTondo, 33, was shot in the driveway of the home she shared with her parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That night, she was out with friends, including Mr. Jeter’s older brother, and was last seen alive after she was dropped off at her house.</p>
<p>Mr. Santicola has said that Sheldon Jeter was close friends with Ms. DelTondo and said the pair had at times been romantically involved, particularly in the last five months of her life.</p>
<p>“On occasion they were romantic,” he said in 2018. “But they were not exclusive or anything.”</p>
<p>No one has been charged in Ms. DelTondo’s killing.</p>
<p>"The DelTondo case is still an active investigation," said Beaver County District Attorney David Lozier on Monday. "We have not named Sheldon Jeter as a suspect or person of interest in that case."</p>
<p>Last May and just hours after the CBS television show “48 Hours” featured the case,&nbsp;Mr. Jeter was found unconscious on the side of a road in Aliquippa. Mr. Jeter was revived with Narcan, used in drug overdoses, although his attorney said Mr. Jeter had been drinking heavily at a party.</p>
<p>Mr. Jeter is being held without bail at the Beaver County Jail after an appearance Sunday before Magisterial District Judge Dirk A. Goodwald.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for June 1.</p>
