<h1>South Pittsburgh gang member sentenced for drug dealing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former Pittsburgh man was sentenced Friday to 70 months in federal prison for his role in a large-scale narcotics ring distributing heroin and fentanyl in Pittsburgh's southern neighborhoods and dismantled by an FBI-led wiretap investigation.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV imposed that term on James Givner, 26, who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute heroin and crack cocaine as a member of the Darccide/Smash 44 street gang.</p>
<p>He was among 36 people indicted in the case following taps on numerous cellphones.</p>
<p>The case began in 2017 when the Greater Pittsburgh Safe Streets Task Force began investigating the Darccide gang for narcotics trafficking on the South Side. A wiretap was initiated in February 2019 and continued through June of that year.</p>
<p>Intercepted calls showed that Givner sold heroin, fentanyl and cocaine base to customers and facilitated drug deals with co-defendant Christopher Highsmith.</p>
<p>During a traffic stop on Jan. 14, 2019, Allegheny County police discovered Givner with more than 180 stamp bags of heroin and a baggie of cocaine base.</p>
<p>Carolyn Bloch and Brendan McKenna, both federal prosecutors, said in sentencing papers that wiretaps and recorded calls at the Allegheny County Jail, where Givner was being held, showed that he played a significant role in dealing heroin and fentanyl.</p>
<p>While he was incarcerated, he also instructed his girlfriend and co-defendant, Danasia McNeal, to run his drug business with the help of Highsmith, the prosecutors said.</p>
<p>On the day of his arrest on the indictment, law officers found Givner in possession of 170 grams of fentanyl and heroin at the apartment in which he stayed with Ms. McNeal. Agents and police also found multiple guns, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Highsmith is set to plead guilty next week. Ms. McNeal is to be sentenced in December.</p>
<p>The investigation into the Darccide gang was funded through the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force program, which provides for money and coordination for law enforcement agencies to work together to investigate and prosecute major drug gangs.</p>
