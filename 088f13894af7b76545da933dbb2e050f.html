<h1>Sweat Equity: Merecedes Williams is ready for her closeup</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The first row of the balcony at an advance screening for “Harriet” at AMC Waterfront 22 in Homestead was filled with high school students from Allderdice, laughing and enjoying the evening out.</p>
<p>The laughter settled down once the movie started and the life of 19th-century abolitionist Harriet Tubman unfurled on the screen. They were absorbing the re-creation of a world they had missed by more than 160 years. Still, there was no denying the parts that resonated.</p>
<p>Merecedes J. Williams, aka Movie Scene Queen, looks forward to that moment of recognition. The social media project assistant for Pittsburgh Public Schools is also the movie critic for The New Pittsburgh Courier.</p>
<p>It was in her capacity as the Courier’s movie critic with access to free advance screenings that it occurred to Ms. Williams to make that opportunity available to Pittsburgh Public School students when it comes to films with educational value.</p>
<p>With the mission of expanding awareness of quality films for young people, Ms. Williams created the Movie Scene Queen entertainment blog seven years ago. Her goal then — as now — is to engage young people in discussions of films and to make free passes available to those in the Pittsburgh Public Schools who want to attend advance screenings.</p>
<p>On evenings when she is supervising a dozen or so students at a screening, Ms. Williams is also thinking about how to approach the movie critically and fairly as a reviewer. She’s both hostess and critic on those occasions, a burden she happily accepts many years into the gig.</p>
<p>The first movie she reviewed for the Courier was “Fruitvale Station,” the 2013 Michael B. Jordan classic about the killing of an unarmed and handcuffed black commuter by cops at a BART Station in Oakland, Calif.</p>
<p>“I thought, ‘Wow, how can I write about this?’” she said, recalling the tears streaming down her face when the movie was over. She fought her way through the sorrow to an evaluation of the film based on its aesthetic merits and social/political implications for African American viewers.</p>
<p>“This is much more than a movie,” she said of the film directed by Ryan Coogler. He would later gain even more fame as the director of “Black Panther,” one of the highest grossing movies of all time. “This is a film about unrepresented people who are being slaughtered by those who are supposed to protect and serve them,” she said.</p>
<p>Just as every superhero movie has an origin story, it was at that moment that Merecedes J. Williams became Movie Scene Queen.</p>
<p>There was so much educational value —&nbsp;painful as it was in a film like “Fruitvale Station” — that she wanted to play a role in exposing young people to that aspect of cinema culture.</p>
<p>“The idea was to stick with black films that predominantly showcase black actors, producers or directors,” she said. Early on, Ms. Williams also decided she had a social responsibility to bring things up in her movie reviews, even though it might cause some people to “look sideways at her” for being too preachy.</p>
<p>“It’s important to me to stay true to myself in every movie review, especially when I’m representing my opinion to a population I’m a part of,” she said of the Courier’s predominantly African American readership. “It’s a burden I’ll live with for the rest of my life as long as I’m black, female and writing.”</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Hill District native who now lives in Homewood with her husband and five kids will continue highlighting films she believes will be of special interest to the community.</p>
<p>To date, the Movie Scene Queen initiative has made more than 56,000 free tickets available to students, their families and those in the community who request them. More than 2,800 Pittsburgh Public School students have accompanied Ms. Williams to screenings at AMC Waterfront and other local theaters.</p>
<p>As a graduate of Schenley High School and the parent of children in the school district, her personal and professional life are intertwined to the point where she jokes, “I always have a group of kids at the movies with me.”</p>
<p>Nonprofits regularly reach out to her for help with movie passes.</p>
<p>“I’ll get a call from some group that will say, ‘Hey, we have $250 to rent a bus, but we don’t necessarily have $500 to send the kids to the movies,” she said. “So I usually bring them to screenings since they’re free and I have access to them.”</p>
<p>She also helps groups and nonprofits raise money for movie events that aren’t free. There are times when groups want to rent theaters for private screenings of culturally significant films.</p>
<p>Ms. Williams’ Movie Scene Queen has partnered with BazanEd.com, a national source for free teaching materials<strong>&nbsp;</strong>that&nbsp;provides curriculum guides for films like “Mandela,”&nbsp;“Birth of a Nation,”&nbsp;“The Hate U Give,”&nbsp;“Midway” and “Fruitvale Station.”</p>
<p>As much as she likes to see students enjoying themselves at a screening, she also wants them to become educated about the issues each movie raises. The movie guides help launch classroom discussions that she can’t be a part of.</p>
<p>Ms. Williams says that Movie Scene Queen currently has 33,000 subscribers between Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Twitter and the website. Her subscribers are scattered throughout the country —&nbsp;a realization that forced her to change the name from the original version when she started it seven years ago: Pittsburgh Movie Scene Queen.</p>
<p>“At the end of February, I’m going to trademark Movie Scene Queen,” Ms. Williams said. “The idea is to keep it as a brand and as a close-knit entity where I can keep promoting movies and at the same time ensure that people who need to see the movies are seeing them,” she said.</p>
<p>Last year, Pittsburgh City Council recognized Ms. Williams’ work on behalf of PPS students with a proclamation declaring May 14, 2019, “Movie Scene Queen Day.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was thrilling for Ms. Williams and her entire extended family, including her mother, sisters, husband and children. Her uncle, former City Councilman Sala Udin, was also on hand as Councilman Rev. Ricky Burgess presented her with the proclamation.</p>
<p>She was amazed a part-time job in journalism that began with tears at a screening for&nbsp;“Fruitvale Station” had come full circle with tears on her Proclamation Day. Still, as much as she would like to be Movie Scene Queen full time, it isn’t at the level where she can do it at the exclusion of a regular paycheck.</p>
<p>“Look,” she said,&nbsp;“from 9 to 5 you do your job. From 6 to 12 you do your hustle. During the day I’m doing my job, but at night I focus on Movie Scene Queen.” For now, Ms. Williams insists, it’s a pretty good trade-off.</p>
<p><em>Correction: In a previous version of this story, Merecedes J. Williams was credited with distributing 5,000 movie tickets to students and family. The correct figure is 56,000 tickets since 2013. Also, the director of&nbsp;‘Black Panther’ is Ryan Coogler, not Brian Coogler.</em></p>
