<h1>Pennsylvania jobless rate hits 15.1% as payrolls collapse</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate skyrocketed in April at the height of the state’s pandemic-driven shutdown to its highest rate in over four decades of record-keeping, the state Department of Labor and Industry said Friday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, payrolls fell by more than 1 million to the lowest level in at least three decades.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate more than doubled to 15.1% in April, up from 5.8% in March, the department said. The department had initially said Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate was 6% in March, but that preliminary figure was adjusted downward to 5.8%.</p>
<p>The national rate was 14.7% in April.</p>
<p>Comparing Pennsylvania to national trends, the state is tracking almost the same as it was before the pandemic, Secretary of Labor and Industry Jerry Oleksiak said on a media call Friday. That “attests to the fact that this is a global, a national, pandemic and Pennsylvania is certainly not the only state that has been impacted by this,” he said.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s highest unemployment rate was 12.7% in 1983, according to online federal data that keeps track back to 1976. April’s number is a dramatic change from last year when Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate hit a nearly two-decade low of 4.1%.</p>
<p>A separate survey of employers showed seasonally adjusted non-farm payrolls fell by more than 1 million in April to just above 5 million. That’s the lowest recorded payroll figure for Pennsylvania in online federal data that keeps track back to the start of 1990.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 1.9 million Pennsylvanians have sought unemployment benefits since mid-March, almost one-third of the labor force in April.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Oleksiak said it is too early to make any predictions, the state hopes to see unemployment numbers go down as the majority of Pennsylvania counties start to reopen parts of the economy and some sectors, like construction, begin work again.</p>
<p>Government agencies, including the Pennsylvania Department of Health, the Department of Community and Economic Development and a work group formed by Gov. Tom Wolf, are starting to discuss plans to help businesses adjust to work after COVID-19, Mr. Oleksiak said.</p>
<p>“We know that the world of work and employment will look different, and how different it looks, we’ll have some say in that,” he said.</p>
<p>“The mitigation efforts are working,” Mr. Oleksiak said. “The more we can flatten that curve and get more counties open, the more likely it is that the numbers will change in the right direction.”</p>
<p>Regional and county data will be released on June 2 and labor and job statistics for May 2020 will be released June 19.</p>
