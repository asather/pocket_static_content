<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County Police detectives have joined in the search for Janet Ann Walsh, a Shaler resident who hasn’t been seen since Jan. 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shaler police requested assistance from county detectives on Monday, a week after the 70-year-old woman was reported missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Walsh and her daughter were supposed to meet for dinner on Jan. 20, but Ms. Walsh never appeared and did not contact her daughter. Officers were called to her home on Dolores Drive around 8:30 p.m. and&nbsp; later learned that Ms. Walsh was last seen at church a day earlier.</p>
<p>Ms. Walsh is a white female with blonde hair and hazel eyes, according to police. She is 5-foot-3 and 170 pounds.</p>
<p>Detectives are also looking for her vehicle — a silver 2018 Chevrolet Trax with a Pennsylvania plate number KTW-6007. The vehicle has not been seen since Ms. Walsh went missing.</p>
<p>Anyone with information regarding Ms. Walsh should contact the Allegheny County Police via social media or its tip line at 1-833-ALL-TIPS (1-833-255-8477); callers can remain anonymous.</p>
