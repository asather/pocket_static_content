<h1>If it's not toilet paper, don't flush it, plumbers say</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jordan Echard, general manager of the Pittsburgh Division for Roto-Rooter, recalled the early rush at the stores when folks began stocking up on supplies in March.</p>
<p>“I was at Sam’s Club and watching people buying up wet wipes, paper towels, napkins. When you start flushing that stuff, you’re going to get in trouble real fast.”</p>
<p>With more people staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic, plumbers are staying busy, even as elective services like that bathroom renovation are down.</p>
<p>Turns out, just because that pack of wet wipes claims to be flushable doesn’t mean they really are.</p>
<p>Baby wipes and the like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTdiL3TPI4Y" target="_blank">don’t break down</a> the way toilet paper does and can get stuck in the pipes. And who wants that headache when you’re already self-isolating?</p>
<p>“They’re not made to break down,” Mr. Echard said. “And depending on how your house is situated, if there’s not a lot of incline on your pipes, they’ll get lodged and then nothing goes through. It backs up into the house.”</p>
<p>Ernie Fagnelli, owner, of Fagnelli Plumbing, Heating, &amp; Cooling in Oakland, said calls for clogged drains have been coming in steadily.</p>
<p>“The key thing is, even if it says it’s flushable —&nbsp;none of that biodegrades quickly,” he said.</p>
<p>While plumbing businesses are considered essential during the shutdown due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the companies are taking precautions when they enter someone’s home.</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter is sanitizing vehicles and social distancing while wearing protective gear.</p>
<p>Mr. Fagnelli said the precautions help everyone involved.</p>
<p>“We’re wearing gloves, masks coveralls,” Mr. Fagnelli said. “We’re protecting them and our own families.”</p>
