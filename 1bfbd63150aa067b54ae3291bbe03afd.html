<h1>Council bill on parks tax money delayed by legal opinion</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A proposal for how council should administer the new tax revenue for city parks hit a snag Wednesday as a legal review cited&nbsp;“multiple conflicts” in a draft ordinance that aims to make all nine council members trustees of the funds and keep that money housed within the city clerk’s budget.</p>
<p>The opinion dated Jan. 28 issued by the city’s Law Department argues that the ordinance violates the city’s “strong mayor”-style Home Rule Charter that grants the mayor power to propose a budget&nbsp;“to which council must react.”</p>
<p>The opinion, which is not public but was viewed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, further argued that council does not have the power to create a board and that by keeping funds in the clerk’s budget line item, the&nbsp;“mayor is frozen out of his ability to effectively manage city revenue.”</p>
<p>While the legal opinion protests some aspects of the proposal, council is still charged with passing legislation that creates a trust fund for the tax and authorizing any contract the city would enter into with an outside entity to maintain park land.</p>
<p>The half-mill property tax increase — $50 on every $100,000 of assessed real estate value — was narrowly approved by city voters and is expected to raise an estimated $10 million. The nonprofit&nbsp;Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, with public support from Mayor Bill Peduto, petitioned for the ballot referendum.</p>
<p>The city’s charter now states that a parks trust fund must adhere to certain “values,” including maintenance of public parks, improving park safety and providing equitable funding for parks, “including those in underserved neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>The current draft for how to manage the money, introduced on Jan. 21 by council members Anthony Coghill and Deb Gross, also proposes to split the tax revenue equally among the the nine council districts — a concept that not all members support and that is vehemently opposed by member Ricky Burgess.</p>
<p>On Wednesday in Council Chambers, Mr. Coghill motioned to hold the bill he and Ms. Gross sponsored pending a legal opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess voted no.</p>
<p>“So there’s a legal opinion that I will forward to counsel in the next hour, one that has already been prepared, already done,” Mr. Burgess said.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, why are we talking about this?” Mr. Coghill asked.</p>
<p>“Because I can,” Mr. Burgess responded.</p>
<p>All other members voted for the motion to hold for a legal opinion, except for Councilwoman Erika Strassburger, who abstained.</p>
<p>Before the standing committee meeting adjourned, Mr. Burgess — who represents the District 9 neighborhoods including East Liberty, Homewood and Larimer — turned to two cups of water and began what he said was a presentation for&nbsp;“the viewing audience.”</p>
<p>“I have two pots: this would the African American community and this would be the majority community, and as you see one’s about twice as filled as the other,” he said, as he began to pour equal amounts of water in each.&nbsp;“These [the water] are resources. … No matter how many times you do this, if you give the same resources to different groups of people, given their history, they will never be equal. Equal will lead to inequity. It will lead to continued outcomes that are disproportionately bad for our communities of color.”</p>
<p>Following the meeting, Mr. Coghill and Ms. Gross said they were unaware of any effort to already obtain a legal opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Coghill, who represents District 4, pointed to a poster of parks funding figures in his office that showed the 2020 capital budget allocates no parks funding for his neighborhoods.</p>
<p>“I have facilities in Beechview in horrible shape,” he said, adding that he&nbsp;“gets the calls from coaches, gets the calls from people who walk in the parks.”</p>
<p>Council President Theresa Kail-Smith said that both Mr. Burgess and Mr. Coghill will need to meet with the mayor’s office and present new drafts of legislation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“We need to do it rather quickly because the tax bills are already out, and we want to make sure we’re not leaving tax dollars on the table and that we’re actually doing the things that residents have asked and voted for us to do,” she said.</p>
