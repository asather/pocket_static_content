<h1>Holocaust Center exhibit sheds light on a century of Jewish life in Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A new exhibit at the Holocaust Center offers Pittsburghers a window into a less familiar aspect of their city’s history.</p>
<p>Beginning Sunday, the “For You Were Strangers: Jewish Immigration to Pittsburgh, 1880-1990” exhibit will fill the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh’s front gallery in Greenfield. Newspapers, books and photographs will shed light on a hundred years of Jewish life in&nbsp;Western Pennsylvania, long before many settled in the East End.</p>
<p>The exhibit’s title is a nod to a Torah verse that teaches empathy to newcomers: “You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt,” it reads.</p>
<p>Jewish people came to Pittsburgh as strangers, said director of the Holocaust Center Lauren Bairnsfather. The exhibit tells that story, of changing national immigration policies, the xenophobic attitudes newcomers faced, and the organizations and people that helped migrants make it in a new country.</p>
<p>Eric Lidji, director of the Rauh Jewish History Program and Archives at the Senator John Heinz History Center, said Jewish history runs deep in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“This community is what it is because of immigration,” he said.</p>
<p>One of the exhibit’s panels lays out the history of immigration policy in the United States. Various other panels include profiles of organizations that sprouted up to support new migrants, such as the Irene Kaufmann Settlement house in the Hill District, where migrants could learn English and study to become a citizen, among other resources.</p>
<p>The multimedia exhibit also includes a website that tracks synagogue locations over time, showing Jewish movement around the city.</p>
<p>Every piece of the exhibit highlights individual stories. One such profile is that of Zena Saul, a Polish social worker who dedicated her life to helping other immigrants, according to Jackie Reese, Holocaust Center marketing and education associate.</p>
<p>Mr. Lidji said the exhibit gives local context to national immigration history and will resonate with everyone, regardless of religion.</p>
<p>“I hope that people see their own community story in the Jewish story,” he said.</p>
<p>Visitors will encounter three waves of Jewish migrants, from the pogroms in the late 1800s and early 1900s, to those fleeing the rise of Nazism in the 1920s and ’30s, to Jews fleeing Soviet Russia in the 1970s and ’80s, said Ms. Bairnsfather. Some Jews came fleeing persecution, others came for opportunity.</p>
<p>Ms. Bairnsfather said there are many misconceptions that surround the Pittsburgh Jewish community. She pointed to one instance in which Tree of Life shooting victim Rose Mallinger was reported to have been a Holocaust survivor. Mallinger was 97 when she died, and was born in New Kensington. Bairnsfather said it spoke to a common assumption that all Jews over a certain age in Pittsburgh must have migrated in the wake of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Scholar Barbara Burstin, author of “Steel City Jews: A History of Pittsburgh and Its Jewish Community, 1840-1915,” will speak at the opening on Sunday about the importance of understanding Jewish history in Pittsburgh, while Mr. Lidji will speak about the archives and their role in the exhibit.</p>
