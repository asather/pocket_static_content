<h1>Thoms Run Road closed in Collier after large water main break</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A main road in Collier Township is shut down Tuesday after a large water main break sent water shooting several feet into the air.</p>
<p>The break closed Thoms Run Road between Presto-Sygan and Forsythe roads at around 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Penn-American Water said Tuesday evening that the break impacted a 30-inch main and left approximately 60 customers without service. The company expects that service will be back on by Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the spokesperson said, a water tanker will be stationed this evening at the Presto Fire Department on Thoms Run Road. Customers should bring their own containers.</p>
<p>Once crews remove debris caused by a water main break, Thoms Run Road will be restricted to one lane while repairs are made.</p>
