<h1>The Reds tried to call a Valentine's Day truce, but the Pirates weren't having it</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Would the loving theme of Valentine’s Day make you want to forgive someone you got into an all-out brawl with?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pirates think not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least it appears the team isn’t in the spirit to hash out old grudges after a hilarious tweet Thursday night that totally rejected an olive branch from the Cincinnati Reds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two teams <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/08/23/Pirates-Reds-David-Bell-Hurdle-Dietrich-mercy-rule-Newman-Aquino/stories/201908230142" target="_blank">got into a bench-clearing brawl</a> last July that led to a heap of suspensions for both squads, but the Reds attempted to put the bad blood behind them with a digital Valentine’s Day card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Hi&nbsp;@Pirates... new beginnings for a new season? #RedsValentine,” said a tweet from the Reds’ twitter account paired with a GIF of Reds reliever Amir Garrett — who attempted to swing on the entire Pirates dugout —&nbsp;forming a heart with his hands and asking for a&nbsp;“truce.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pirates’ account responded with a photo that simulated a read receipt on a smart phone, indicating that the message was received, but not to expect a response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Reds didn’t take the friendly diss to heart, however, and replied with another GIF, this time showing second baseman Derek Dietrich giving a little wink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cincinnati kept the spirit of love going through Friday morning, tweeting out clever Valentine’s Day cards to several MLB teams as other accounts responded with a little more glee than the Pirates did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tempers flared July 30 at Great American Ball Park when Pirates pitcher Keone Kela threw up and in to Dietrich. Before the two teams met again just three weeks after the brawl, then-Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said he was&nbsp;“absolutely confident that everything’s resolved” between the clubs.</p>
<p>Is it, though?</p>
