<p>The Borough of Dormont had anticipated celebrating the 100th anniversary of Dormont Pool this year, but because of COVID-19, the pool will not open in 2020.</p>
<p>Council, at its Monday meeting — which was held via Zoom, unanimously approved to not open the pool for the year — stating that it would be too risky to do so during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“I do know the importance of our pool not only to our residents, but to residents in surrounding communities and really the region,” said Council Vice President Jen Mazzocco.</p>

<p>Dormont Pool is one of the largest municipal pools in Pennsylvania at approximately 60,000 square feet.</p>
<p>Ms. Mazzocco said officials considered delaying the opening of the pool, but that was nixed.</p>
<p>“It would just be too risky and would be too much of a cost risk to the borough at this point to open it,” Ms. Mazzocco said. “I think it is very said because it is the 100th anniversary this year and it’s extra sad because of that, but I think this is the best move for us as far as the safety of our residents.”</p>
<p>“Cost savings aside, I think this is the right thing to do just from the safety aspect,” said Councilman John Moore. “I would not want it on my conscience to have somebody go to work, to go to their job at the pool and contract COVID-19. I would not want that for anybody period.”</p>
<p>Borough solicitor John Rushford said that from a legal standpoint it’s nearly impossible to meet all of the CDC’s guidelines for social distancing at the pool area.</p>
<p>“The potential liability of somebody contracting COVID at the pool is just too much of a risk,” Mr. Rushford said. “I think that the borough’s doing the right thing here,” he added.</p>
<p>In his remarks. Council President Jeff Fabus said, “I know this is not an easy decision for all of us. Over the years we have learned how important the pool is to our community, but this is the right decision for the safety our residents, our guests and our employees and I applaud you all for supporting this decision. It’s not an easy one but it is the right one.”</p>
<p>Borough officials said the pool’s 100th anniversary is set to be celebrated next season.</p>
