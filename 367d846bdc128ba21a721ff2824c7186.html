<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: What happened to Justin Schultz?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Larry Little and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Rob T., @RobertTokar66:</strong> Has Justin Schultz played his way into making sure he is not with Pittsburgh next year?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> The best way to do that would have been to put up a monster season and price himself out of town, Rob. That decidedly has not happened.</p>
<p>What has?</p>
<p>That’s the question.</p>
<p>Schultz clearly is not the player he was in his first two full seasons here, when he was a combined plus-49 with 16 goals and 62 assists. Those were followed by two postseasons in which he totaled five goals, 21 points and a plus-8 rating in 33 games. Even last year he had a goal and three points in four games against the Islanders, which was Gretzky-like compared to most of his teammates.</p>
<p>Maybe the answer is as simple as injuries, including the broken leg Schultz sustained early last season and the lower body injury that kept him out for multiple weeks this season. I wonder if he still might be dealing with something.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s his confidence, which has obviously waned.</p>
<p>Penguins historian Bob Grove recently tweeted that Schultz had just one power-play goal in his past 152 games (now 153). Since he returned from his latest injury on Jan. 31, he has no goals, three assists and a minus-8 rating.</p>
<p>But it’s not really about the goal totals. Schultz, after all, has had six seasons, including this one, in which he has scored one or zero power-play goals. It’s more about the eye test — seeing him turn for pucks and make a sharp first pass out of the zone; seeing him fake a shot and move deep into the offensive zone to make a play; seeing him lug the puck effortlessly up ice.</p>
<p>That is the Justin Schultz the Penguins desperately need. There have been a few good signs lately. Just not enough. And if this is going to be the Schultz we see moving forward, I’m not sure he would fit into the Penguins’ plans at any price.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t count him out just yet, but it’s getting late.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Knee, @Elbowuindagut:</strong> At this point, who would you rather see in the 1st round of the playoffs - Flyers or Caps?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Caps, not that I would necessarily predict the Penguins to win that series (although I might). The Flyers seem like a bad matchup, not that I would necessarily pick them to beat the Penguins (although I might). I could picture the Flyers bringing out the worst in the Penguins, as they have before, Dr. Knee.</p>
<p>The Flyers have the puck all the time (they are a great faceoff team), and are a significantly better defensive team than the Capitals. That shouldn’t be a surprise with Alain Vigneault and Michel Therrien on the bench. They also have a better power play than either the Penguins or the Capitals.</p>

<p><strong>Chris Hawthorne, @Hawthorneee:</strong> Hi Joe, Happy Meatball Day. Do you think the Pirates pitching staff will perform better than last year? Why or not why not?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Hello, Chris. Happy Day-After-Meatball-Day to you. I think it will be better — but let me qualify that. The Pirates had the second-worst ERA in the National League last season at 5.18, trailed only by the Colorado Rockies, who play in a hitters’ paradise. The Pirates also gave up the third-most home runs, behind Colorado and Philly.</p>
<p>So, do I think they can improve upon a 5.18 ERA and 241 home runs?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>By much?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Mitch Keller, Chris Archer and Trevor Williams will be better. But again, that won’t take much, as those three combined for an ERA of over 17 (Keller made just 11 starts).</p>
<p><strong>Zack Hough, @Hoagie7187:</strong> With the Penguins recent struggles are you confident they can rebound before the playoffs and what do you blame their struggles on?</p>
<p><strong>Wh!T3\/\/0Lf13, @WhiteW0lf6913:</strong> Will the penguins make the playoffs? If so, are they a one and done. I think they are.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Hello, concerned gentlemen. The Penguins will make the playoffs, though there should be some concern about that. They are, after all, the worst team in the NHL over the past 10 games. Their struggles can be traced to a lack of discipline, whether it’s Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang taking a ton of penalties lately, or players making poor decisions with the puck all over the ice, or players making ill-timed pinches in the offensive zone or players blowing coverages in the defensive zone.</p>
<p>This team’s defensive conscience has eroded over the past several weeks, to the point where they are looking very much like last year’s Penguins.</p>
<p>In the first half of the season, the Penguins would go games in a row without allowing an odd-man break. Now, it’s a surprise when they go two periods in a row. This is very fixable. So why can’t they fix it?</p>
<p><strong>Jammy Jam, @davefromdirt:</strong> What is your favorite kind of cheese?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Cheese danish.</p>
<p><strong>Frankie J Ryan, @Frankie32110332:</strong> Good evening Joe...do you think the Steelers should consider drafting a safety if a good one dropped in their lap, such as Antoine Winfield Jr.?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Good evening, Frankie, although it’s actually morning. No, I do not think the Steelers should draft a safety, even though I am concerned about Terrell Edmunds moving forward, and you can never have enough quality defensive backs in this league. The Steelers need to take the best offensive skill position player available — especially if it’s a Big Ten running back (I’m thinking Jonathan Taylor or JK Dobbins).</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Davis, @ChrisD173:</strong> What sport do you watch on TB that would surprise us?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> As we speak, Dr. Davis (on a Monday night), I am watching DePaul decimate Marquette in the Big East women’s basketball championship. And it’s quite enjoyable. I watch tons of softball, as well, with my daughter.</p>
<p>Now, here the sports I NEVER watch:</p>
<p>• Golf</p>
<p>• NASCAR</p>
<p>• UFC</p>
<p>• Mullsy shooting 3-pointers</p>
