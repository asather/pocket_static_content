<h1>Need your hockey fix? Meet the guy who's streaming simulated games live</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The pickings for live sports during the coronavirus pandemic aren’t just slim. They’re basically non-existent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tyson T. of Vancouver is looking to change that as best he can. The 21-year-old is picking up where the NHL left off in suspending its season last week by streaming simulations of games via EA’s&nbsp;“NHL 20” title on the nights they were originally scheduled to be played in real life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Penguins, for example, were supposed to play the New York Islanders on Sunday night, so Tyson streamed a simulation that the Penguins lost in overtime, 4-3, despite two goals from forward Brandon Tanev.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?autoplay=false&amp;t=02h06m00s&amp;video=v567915586" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" width="620" height="378" frameborder="0"></iframe><a style="padding: 2px 0px 4px; display: block; width: 345px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 10px; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/567915586?t=02h06m00s&amp;tt_content=text_link&amp;tt_medium=vod_embed"><br></a></p>
<p>Since the simulations in what Tyson is calling the IceTilt league on Twitch have started, the Penguins have beaten Carolina and Columbus to solidify their place in the standings, which he is tabulating as well to give the games some weight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the schedule of streams over at the IceTilt League Twitter page. Games go off roughly every half hour on a given evening, and some adjustments are made to distribute the steams a bit more evenly than in real life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s certainly not as good as the real thing, but it’s better than nothing, right? So the Post-Gazette reached out an asked a few more questions about the experiment. Tyson’s answers are below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How did you get the idea to stream all of these games?</strong></p>
<p>The idea to run a virtual league and simulate the rest of the NHL season schedule in NHL 20, as well as stream it, popped in my head just hours after I had found out that the real NHL would be "paused". Once I had heard that there wouldn't be any more hockey to watch for a while, I immediately thought, "I guess I'll just play NHL 20 to entertain myself and get my fix while the league is off". That's when it clicked for me, I had recently bought a gaming capture device that allows me to record gameplay footage from my Xbox in high quality to my PC, so I figured it would be a unique idea to capture and stream NHL 20 games to see how the rest of the NHL season could theoretically play out. I also decided to make a dedicated Twitter account to keep track of scores, schedules, and standings, which makes streaming the games more worthwhile than just pointlessly broadcasting NHL matchups in a video game.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of feedback have you received? Have people been grateful?</strong></p>
<p>I've received overall good feedback, I've had a couple dedicated viewers since I started and it's nice to see that they are committed to following the streams and the results of games. I've also had a couple nice messages thanking me personally for putting the effort in to provide just a bit of entertainment during this strange time in the world.</p>
<p><strong>How accurate are the rosters compared to the present day?</strong></p>
<p>The rosters are as accurate as I can make them. I have installed the latest "roster update" that EA has put out for the game, but, since the last update was Feb 25th, I've made minor adjustments to rosters such as removing currently injured players or making small tweaks to lineups. I know that the rosters are not 100% perfect, so I welcome any fans that may have more knowledge of their team than me to suggest changes I should make to ensure better authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to do a stream for the playoffs based on the final standings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I do plan on streaming the playoffs. That is why I am keeping track of the scores/standings on my Twitter and on my Twitch channel page.</p>
<p><strong>What's been your favorite game on the stream so far?</strong></p>
<p>My favorite game that I've streamed so far is probably the very first game I streamed. It was the Carolina Hurricanes vs. the New Jersey Devils. The game started with four unanswered goals from the Devils, followed by two goals by the Hurricanes, which was then followed up by two more goals from the Devils. Then in the third period, the Hurricanes scored four straight goals including one with 8 seconds left to tie the game 6-6 and send it to OT. The game went to a shootout where Carolina won in the end. Definitely the most exciting game yet and it really excited me that the first game was so thrilling even though it was just CPU vs CPU.</p>
<p><strong>This seems like a lot of work. Is it? Do you worry about getting burned out on it before the end of the season?</strong></p>
<p>It is a fair amount of work, however I enjoy it, so the stream which usually lasts around 4-5 hours flies by and before I know it I'm on the final game of the day and it's time to update the standings. I don't worry about getting burned out because I'm a diehard "hockey guy" down to my core. I'm the kind of person that can spend hours a day playing NHL 20, while watching NHL games, then go out late night to play in a hockey game of my own and do it all again the next day. I'm also a person that needs to see projects through to the end, so even if I've got 2 people watching I'm going to make sure I'm streaming all of the games all the way to the Stanley Cup final.</p>
<p><strong>Do you watch all of the games? Or do you leave the room and just let the game do its thing from time to time?</strong></p>
<p>I watch every game, I'm always at my desk managing the stream and making sure everything is going smoothly. Occasionally I'll leave the room to do something quick, but I don't have much time because I need to be ready to advance to the next period every 10 minutes or so.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your pick to win the virtual Stanley Cup?</strong></p>
<p>My pick to win the virtual Stanley Cup is probably the Boston Bruins or Tampa Bay Lightning, simply because they have very talented teams and are already at the top of the standings. However, the Lightning are playing poorly lately with two straight loses to Detroit and New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the Penguins' chances? It seems like they've broken out of their recent real-world funk in the game</strong></p>
<p>I think the Penguins have a decent shot at winning it all. They have a lot of firing power and just like in real life if you can score a lot you have a good chance to win. The Penguins have scored three-plus goals in all 3 games so far, if they keep up the scoring like that, I don't see why the can't be a top contender.</p>
<p><strong>Which team are you rooting for and how do you think it will perform?</strong></p>
<p>I'm a Canucks fan so I hope they can find a way to make the playoffs. It's a big pileup for the wild card spots in the Western Conference so I hope they find a way to get in the top 3 of the Pacific Division. If they do make the playoffs I don't expect them to go far, but it would be nice to see some playoff hockey for once.</p>
<p><strong>Any plans to dabble in any other sports/games? Like baseball?</strong></p>
<p>I don't have any current plans to expand this idea to different sports or games yet. However, if this league grew enough I suppose there's a possibility as long as people are willing to watch. I have noticed lately that a couple official accounts for pro teams have started streaming their games too such as the Montreal Canadiens and the Phoenix Suns in the NBA.</p>
