<h1>Superior Court overturns Beaver County conviction in 1979 slaying</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Superior Court on Monday reversed the 2013 third-degree murder conviction of former Bridgewater Councilman Gregory Scott Hopkins and ordered a new trial, finding that the testimony of the prosecution’s expert witness, Dr. Cyril Wecht, was not based on science, but on his “own personal opinion.”</p>
<p>“The record is clear that Dr. Wecht failed to use scientific methodology but instead resorted to offering his opinions based upon what he surmised from the physical evidence,” the three-judge panel wrote.</p>
<p>The evidence the court referred to was DNA recovered from the crime scene in 1979 but not processed until 2010.</p>
<p>Janet Walsh, who had previously been involved in a sexual relationship with Mr. Hopkins, was found on Sept. 1, 1979, in her Monaca apartment, lying face-down on her bed, with her hands bound behind her back by the belt of a bathrobe.&nbsp;The 23-year-old had been strangled.</p>
<p>Police did not find any forced entry into her home, and the case remained unsolved until Mr. Hopkins was charged in 2012. Two years earlier, state police did testing on the nightgown Ms. Walsh was wearing when she was found; a top sheet; and the bathrobe tie. The testing revealed Mr. Hopkins’ DNA.</p>
<p>The Beaver County District Attorney’s office charged Mr. Hopkins, now 74, and argued that he killed Ms. Walsh during a sexual encounter.</p>
<p>Mr. Hopkins, however, denied the allegations and said he was at his home the morning Ms. Walsh was killed. He claimed he had not had relations with her for three to four weeks.</p>
<p>At trial in 2013, the prosecution called Dr. Wecht, a renowned forensic pathologist, to testify as an expert. He testified that Ms. Walsh died of strangulation during sexual activity, and that Mr. Hopkins’ seminal fluid would have been deposited around the time of her death based on the locations where it was found on the nightgown, sheet and robe belt. He called his theory “topographical distribution.”</p>
<p>Dr. Wecht contended that with no signs of struggle or forced entry, it was likely Ms. Walsh knew her attacker.</p>
<p>“For me from an investigative, analytical standpoint to conceive that somehow four weeks have gone by and she has not thoroughly washed a sheet that she sleeps under, that she has not washed the belt of a bathrobe that she uses, that she’s still wearing a nightgown that she sleeps in, I just find that extremely unlikely and [it] is on all of those findings that I express the opinion that I did,” Dr. Wecht testified.</p>
<p>The jury found Mr. Hopkins guilty of third-degree murder, and he was ordered to serve eight to 16 years in prison.</p>
<p>In June 2017, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief, arguing that his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to file what is called a Frye motion pretrial challenging the methodology of Dr. Wecht’s opinion about “topographical distribution” — that it was not generally accepted in his field.</p>
<p>At a hearing before the trial judge in December 2017, two experts called by Mr. Hopkins’ attorneys said that Dr. Wecht’s testimony was not based on medical science.</p>
<p>Dr. David Fowler, the chairperson and former president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, said that Dr. Wecht’s notion of “topographical distribution,” was “not something that forensic pathologists typically do. It’s outside the national practice standards.”</p>
<p>And Dr. Kimberly Collins, the incoming president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, said that forensic pathology does not allow for the conclusions Dr. Wecht reached in the Hopkins’ case, and that she had never even heard the term&nbsp;“topographical distribution.”</p>
<p>In reaching its opinion, the state Superior Court found that testimony to be compelling.</p>
<p>“They stated unequivocally that there are no standards, studies, tests or generally accepted methodology in the field of forensic science to determine the date of a seminal DNA deposit,” the court wrote. The term “topographical distribution’ is an impressive sounding label, but there is simply no methodology to support it.”</p>
<p>The Superior Court said, because Dr. Wecht portrayed his novel opinion as scientific, he was required to support it through generally accepted methodology but failed to do so.</p>
<p>“There were no standards, empirical data or studies undergirding Dr. Wecht’s statement. It was simply his own personal opinion based upon his review of the physical evidence.”</p>
<p>The court wrote that Dr. Wecht’s testimony was the centerpiece of the prosecution’s case and that it prejudiced Mr. Hopkins.</p>
<p>“The jury likely found appellant guilty because Dr. Wecht’s status as an expert added luster to his theory of ‘topographical distribution,’” the court wrote. “We believe that there is a reasonable probability the outcome of this case may well have been different had trial counsel moved to preclude Dr. Wecht’s testimony under Frye.”</p>
<p>In remanding for a new trial, the court noted that expert testimony on “topograpical distribution” will not be admissible.</p>
<p>Beaver County District Attorney David Lozier said his office disagrees with the opinion.</p>
<p>He is leaning toward filing an appeal and has 14 days to do so — either before an en banc panel of the Superior Court or directly to the state Supreme Court..</p>
<p>Dr. Wecht said Monday that his testimony had more to do with “simple logic.”</p>
<p>“Forensic pathology is not an absolute science,” he said. “A lot of our conclusions are matters other people agree or disagree on.</p>
<p>“A ruling that deprives a forensic science expert from using common sense, I find that intellectually puzzling.”</p>
