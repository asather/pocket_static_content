<h1>Joe Starkey’s mailbag: Did Starling Marte fulfill his immense potential?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lee Lacy and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p>Actually, we begin yet again with our intergalactically popular Twitter poll and a simple query that received a ton of response (around 1,200 votes in three hours) Monday:</p>
<p>“Starling Marte played just about the equivalent of six full seasons with the Pirates. He missed significant time (including MLB suspension). He hit .287 with 108 HR, 239 steals, 555 runs, .793 OPS, two Gold Gloves and an All-Star Game appearance. You would say Marte …</p>
<p><strong>Exceeded expectations:</strong> 14.1%</p>
<p><strong>Met expectations:</strong> 57%</p>
<p><strong>Underachieved:</strong> 28.9%</p>
<p><strong>What we learned:</strong> That nearly one in three responders feel Marte “underachieved,” which surprised me. And yet, I can’t totally disagree.</p>
<p>Marte, you see, was a highly unusual case. Not easy to assess. He was a wildly talented and productive player. There is no doubt about that. He just had a year in which he hit .295 with 23 home runs, 97 runs and 25 steals in just 132 games. How many players hit .290 or better with at least 20 home runs, 25 steals and 95 runs?</p>
<p>Let me help you with that — one. And his name is Christian Yelich.</p>
<p>Granted, those are arbitrary numbers to pull out of the ether, and the stolen base total — we could argue about the importance of stolen bases — eliminated a lot of players. But you get the idea: Marte put up some impressive numbers in limited games. That is somewhat the story of his career.</p>
<p>He was a good and sometimes very good player whom we wanted to be great from the time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHBAYxQLuD0" target="_blank">he homered in his first career at-bat</a>. From before that, actually, when we heard of this amazing five-tool talent in the minors.</p>
<p>Did he “underachieve,” then?</p>
<p>I’m still thinking.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a WAR machine during the Pirates’ three-year playoff run. His total WAR (a stat which attempts to measure all-around production, including defense) for those three years was 15.9. Andrew McCutchen’s was 19.4. Marte made an All-Star game and won two Gold Gloves.</p>
<p>And yet … Marte never achieved the kind of plate discipline that would have made him a consistent menace. His career OPS (combined on-base and slugging percentages) stands below .800. He helped ruin the 2017 season by getting busted for performance-enhancing drugs. He never fulfilled his immense home run potential.</p>
<p>In the end, I’m thinking that if you told me all of that — if you told me Marte would make just one All-Star game — I would have been disappointed.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s on me, and maybe “underachieved” is the wrong word because of its negative connotation. Marte achieved plenty. He was often a joy to watch. But I’m not sure he fulfilled his immense potential.</p>
<p>Not yet, anyway, and it’s getting late. He’s 31 and not the defensive magician he used to be.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Mac Bakehouse, @MaryMacMixes:</strong> All of this Pirates news really has me down...what do you think? Any positives? Do they actually have a plan or is their plan just to scuttle the ship?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I think the plan is fairly clear at this point, Mary Mac. They’re going to strip it down and try to build it back up, a la the Houston Astros. Now all they’ll need is a ton of patience, a couple of a star hitters, several star pitchers and an elaborate sign-stealing system.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, the Marte trade showed their hand, in that the two players they received, while favorably reviewed, are nowhere near the major leagues. This is going to be a “process,” to borrow the Philadelphia 76ers’ rebuilding word.</p>
<p>I’m not saying I disagree with the strategy. But it’s going to be a process.</p>
<p><strong>Paully D, @YaBoyPD:</strong> How close in payroll can Ben Cherington get the 2020 Pirates to the 1997 Pirates by opening day?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Not very, Paully, though he’s giving it the old (Amherst) college try. Those Pirates were just above $9 million, easily the lowest in the majors that year, and made a run at the division before finishing below .500. I’m sure if you did the math and adjusted for payroll inflation and all that, however, you find some interesting comparisons in terms of what the Pirates are spending compared to their counterparts.</p>
<p>Hint: not much.</p>
<p><strong>JS, @JsWittywitty1:</strong> Most improved team in the Pirates’ division this year?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> The easy answer is the Reds, JS (I like those initials), but even if they improve by 10 games, they won’t make the playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>jon montag, @JonMontag:</strong> Will the Pirates break one million in attendance this year?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Yes, but maybe not by much, jon. They’ve leveled off at just below 1.5 million each of the past two years. If this thing comes apart in April and May, all bets are off. But I still believe they will rather easily top 1 million. The only team under that mark last season was the Miami Marlins at around 811,000.</p>
<p><strong>MFH, @FakeHoltzy22:</strong> Since Marte was traded, how low do you think the Pirates payroll will get in 2020?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey: </strong>Well, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/27/Pirates-payroll-bob-nutting-staring-marte-trade-ben-cherington/stories/202001270120" target="_blank">according to our Bill Brink</a>, it’s down to around $50 million at the moment, Fake Holtzy, or right around Gerrit Cole’s weekly paycheck.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Nelson, @Piratefan1970:</strong> Did the Pirates get enough for Marte?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> How should I know, Scott? The two guys they got are barely out of kindergarten. However, I like the idea of taking risks on big talent, high-ceiling prospects. Liover Peguero is a 19-year-old shortstop. Brennan Malone, a right-hander, was the 33rd overall pick in 2019. Both are physically gifted players. I’ll leave the evaluations to the Keith Laws of the world — and he seemed to like the return.</p>
<p>In baseball, however, the odds are always against prospects rising through the minors and reaching their potential. That’s why you need to accumulate a lot of them.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Ahrens, @8thBernardSS:</strong> Convince me there’s a reason to even pay attention or care about the Pirates for the next 5 years. Any chance we win 70 games?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> That’s their job, Dr. Ahrens. Not mine.</p>
