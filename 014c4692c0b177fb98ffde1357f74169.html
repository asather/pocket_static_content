<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 01.29.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It won't be long kids until we start our weekly chat, so get those questions ready.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, I got some time now, so we just as well should start our chat. Go.....</p>
<p><strong>Ralph</strong>: Don't you agree the offensive line needs help? Maybe an experienced coach, that can teach run blocking. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I agree they need to change what they do to focus on better run blocking. That's where Munchak is sorely missed. So yes.</p>
<p><strong>K Dot</strong>: Hi Gerry, I actually agree with Primetime, I think there are TOO many players entering the HOF. I think the term "future HOF'er" is thrown around too much. What's your take on it? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: So do I, though it has nothing to do with agreeing with that guy. Putting 20 guys in the HOF this year -- 15 as part of centennial class -- cheapens the overall process of achievement. To me, the HOF should be for the special players, the truly great players, not just the good ones or very good ones. Just because people holler and complain and whine that so-and-so should be in the HOF is not a reason to be put in the HOF. OK, so some good players are left out. You know what, then do more than you did. Do more than the guy who is already in the HOF. Five a year is plenty. Don't cheapen the Hall by putting in 20 people just to placate those who complain.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Medium Chest</strong>: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why are some fans obsessed with who the backup qb will be next season? A guy like Mariota is not leading us to the SB why not take the year to develop MR if Ben were to be unable to go?</span> <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That is the plan. A guy like Mariota is not going to sign here because he will want to go somewhere where he can be a starter, or have a chance to be a starter. That's not with the Steelers. If the Steelers sign a veteran QB, it will be as the No. 3 guy, a guy who can step in if, in a similar situation to 2019, Rudolph would struggle as the replacement for BR.</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: I just read some foolishness on Twitter that some insiders are saying #43 is not a lock to make the HOF? My response was if Reed got in on the first ballot, Troy gets in on the first ballot!!! Was that just click bait or is there some validity to it? What say you Mr. Dulac??? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, the difference is, Reed's stats are so much greater than Polamalu's. He had twice as many interceptions (64 to 32) and returned seven of them for TDs. He is the league's all-time leader in interception return yards (1,590), including two of the longest in in league history (106, 107 yards). Look, I think Troy is a first-ballot selection and I think that will be proved on Saturday. But I can see where some voters will compare his numbers to Reed and might shy away from voting, even though I think they are nuts.</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Your columnist in arms Mr. Cook seems to think #84 will be a HOFer. As much as I LIKED him when he was here and he was/is uber talented, I'm not sure the recent events will work in his favor when it comes time for him to be voted on. What say you Mr. Dulac??? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I do not think he will get in the HOF. And don't compare it to Terrell Owens (another head case), either. T.O.'s number dwarf what AB has done, even though AB's numbers in a six-year period are greater than anyone other receiver in league history. But, just on his behavior alone, which is far worse than anything T.O. has ever done, he should NEVER even be considered for the HOF. And he won't.</p>
<p><strong>K Dot</strong>: If the league is going back to a running offense wouldn't it make sense to try to keep Hargrave and let Hilton walk? We got beat late in the season because teams were running against our sub package, it's time to bring back the 3-4. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, I don't think they agree with you. Mike Tomlin believes in sub-package football because of the way the game is played. That doesn't mean I disagree with you. They want to keep Hargrave; it will just be a matter if he thinks he can get a better offer on the FA market.</p>
<p><strong>Andy</strong>: I'm positive you have me blocked, Gerry - You can’t follow or see @gerrydulac’s Tweets. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You are unblocked. Just watch the comments.</p>

<p><strong>Bigedbarr71 </strong>: Hi Gerry! I keep hearing that "Oh, there is too many "Steelers " in the Hall of Fame. To my knowledge, players are inducted as players, not as members of a team. Is this still the way it works? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That is true, but I think what happens Ed is that voters have a tendency to think, 'Oh, we've put too many Steelers from the 70s in the HOF, let's try to spread it around.' Not all of them, but I'm sure some of them.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Gerry, Never understood Troy's beef with the Steeler's FO. Did he expect them to keep him on the team when he was not able to perform at the level needed to be successful? I guess entitlement syndrome exists in all walks of life. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'll be honest, I'm not sure what it is, either. But I will also say, knowing Troy, I'm surprised there is some type of animosity (or whatever it is) on his part.</p>
<p><strong>Jon</strong>: Gerry, will there be a wide receivers coach announced soon? Any other coaching changes or will it be status quo? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes, Mike Tomlin was looking at candidates at the Senior Bowl. I'm sure there will be something happening there soon.</p>
<p><strong>DB</strong>: Do you have any idea who is the favorite to be the new WR coach? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I do not. I'm told it won't be Hines.</p>
<p><strong>jds317</strong>: How can they turn around this offense? No #1 receiver, no feature RB, no quality at TE, an aging, ineffective OL and a 38 yo QB coming off major surgery. Can they fill all these holes in the off season? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: If No. 7 comes back healthy and ready to go, you'll be surprised how some of what ails them can be corrected.</p>
<p><strong>Jud</strong>: What are your thoughts on draft Rounds and picks? My thoughts are 2 -OL, 3 - RB, 3C - TE, 4- WR, then ??? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: First off, there is no No. 3 pick as of right now. They are expected to get a compensatory pick for the bottom of the third round, but that hasn't been guaranteed. But, no, there won't be an offensive lineman on the second round, probably not until the fourth. I think you will see either a running back, wide receiver or tight end go with their top pick. Rest assured, it will be a skill player. It's a good year for WRs, so they could have a high grade on one even when they pick in the second round. Me? I take a running back who is a No. 1 running back, not a backup running back.</p>
<p><strong>Ryno</strong>: It sounds like there is 0% chance Duck returns next season? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I wouldn't say that. But the chances aren't great.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmie</strong>: Should a player's character be a significant factorin choosing Hall of Famers? AB apparently thought only of his own career and not what his behavior would do to the Steelers' chances. Shouldn't that disqualify him, in spite of his magnificent numbers? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Considering HIS behavior...absolutely. It is the worst, most insubordinate, most ill-mannered, I have ever seen in an NFL player.</p>
<p><strong>VaStiller</strong>: Would Andy Dalton be a consideration for an affordable veteran backup? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Possibly, but I think Andy Dalton thinks he can still be a starter, which I don't disgree with. I think with the right team Andy Dalton can be viable.</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Gerry, Fans who are okay with MR being the QB if Ben can't go must not have been around during the Mark Malone era? Hoping A QB will develop can turn to years of mediocrity. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think MR is more like Neil O'Donnell, not MM.</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: why aren't the steelers calling HInes Ward about the WR coach opening? I guarantee he would rather work here than for the jets &amp; it's lateral step so he should be allowed to take the job- <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, you might be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: Who in your opinion will not be on the team next year <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Foster, Chickillo, Burns, McCullers.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/.media/2/2019/07/31/e8cb627f-df86-4bcb-a445-72a34e955033.jpg" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: Gerry, if the FO had a crystal ball last spring and decided to sign Bud to a multiyear deal, what might that have, say 5 yrs for $40M? And now we are going to tag for $16M, probably twice. Would have been a brilliant move in hindsight, and we would be comparing it to the Fitz trace and which was the most brilliant move? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, Tom, it's like you say -- IF they had a crystal ball. They didn't, and that's hindsight.</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: Could it ever happen that two players from the same team are elected in the same year to the HOF? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yeah, the Steelers have already had it happen twice. Blount and Bradshaw went in in 1989 and Lambert and Franco went in in 1990.</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Order of importance RB1, TE1, S, OL, WR3-5. Do you agree and if not re-rank them. also which ones do you think we get in the draft and which ones in FA. I say DRAFT(RB1, TE1, WR3-5) FA(OL, S) <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Somewhat. I say RB, TE, G, WR. Or RB, WR, TE, G. Though I think you will see them try to sign a tight end in free agency, eliminating their need to take one in the draft.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron</strong>: Hi, Gerry. What is the current status of our cap space? There is so much contradictory information out there. Thanks! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No matter what it is, they have plenty of time to conform to the cap. They are the best at it, so I wouldn't fret.</p>
<p><strong>NYC</strong>: Last offseason there was a huge media circus around pittsburgh, this year we're favored to be on Hard Knocks, potentially host the HOF game, and have a gnat of a former WR that is still and always linked to the team. Is the ship heading in the right direction? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: First off, the Steelers won't HOST the HOF game, they will might play in it; Hard Knocks will have no effect on what happens in 2020 season and AB is linked to the team only by those people who moronically still care about what he does. Nobody in the organization has anything to do with him.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Do you think James Conner will be the top RB next year or do we draft one or pick someone up in free agency? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Maybe for one more year. Doesn't mean the Steelers won't take a top RB with their first pick.</p>
<p><strong>California Bill </strong>: Are we putting too much hope on Ben being healthy <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There is no evidence to suggest thinking otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: what yo op of the running QBs in the league? Do you see it becoming a trend or will injuries scare coaches from doing that long term? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Let's see how long they keep it up, especially when they get a $100 million+ contract.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: Which comes first? The Steelers win a playoff game or Mike Tomlin's INCREDIBLE non-losing season streak is broken? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Playoff win.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: I don un how any expects any back QB to lead a team to a Super Bowl. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nick Foles.</p>
<p><strong>Jake</strong>: Gerry, What changes if any would you make with the coaching staff? Thank you. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: 1-800-GET-MUNCH</p>
<p><strong>Vulcan Nation</strong>: Gerry can we see the offense getting some real play makers for next season andbeyond <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think you will see them make that attempt. I don't care whon you have on your team, it's not the same when you lose star players such as LeV Bell and that other guy.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: Which TE would be your choice to sign as a free agent? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't know. I haven't studied who will be available for sure. Hunter Henry might be at the top of my list. Not Eric Ebron.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Steeler</strong>: Gerry I have been a Steeler fan forever. I remember watching John Henry Johnson twirl through the line before we became the Steel Curtain Steelers. I am worried I will not see the Steelers achieve what we have all come to expect since the 70's. Has there been any word on how Ben is doing ? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, I'm not sure you will the Steelers, or any team, achieve what the Steelers did in the 1970s -- win four Super Bowls in six years. Those are lofty and unrealistic expectations. But it wasn't that long ago when they made three trips to the Super Bowl in six years (2005, 2008, 2010). So you're not being deprived. Just spoiled.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Odd question but does the NFL have the same cap provision that if a player goes to IR they no longer count against the cap. Asking in case news isn't good with Ben <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, they count.</p>
<p><strong>Jud</strong>: How much do you think the concussion affected Rudolph this year? Also can he realistically challenge Ben for the spot? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not at all. But I think getting knocked out, conked on the head and being accused of a racial slur took a negative toll on him.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I like Vannett coming out of college and thought he compared to Hooper. Do you think he has reached his ceiling or could he blossom with more time in Pittsburgh? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think Nick Vannett is a nice No. 3 tight end. I like him.</p>
<p><strong>Trent</strong>: In light of Kobe Bryant’s tragic pass, can you think of any Pittsburgh sports figure who had the same aura Kobe did? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Roberto Clemente, to a degree, if you're going to talk about athletes who were tragically taken from us. But Clemente didn't have the same impact nationally or on his sport as Kobe did. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The only one who was really hyped was Ladarius Green, and his problem was concussions, not ability. The other guys just failed to perform. Their recent track record has not been very good. But, as you pointed up, Nelson has been very good. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, that's all we got today. Thanx for the questions.</p>
