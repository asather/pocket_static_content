<p>Also, there will be single-lane closures on Route 28 in both directions this weekend — from 7 p.m. Friday through 5 a.m. Monday — between&nbsp;the Millvale interchange (Exit 3B) in Shaler and the Highland Park Bridge. Crews will be working on concrete patching, the bridge deck, paving operations, and&nbsp;guide rail and drainage upgrades, utility adjustments, and signing and pavement marking improvements.</p>
