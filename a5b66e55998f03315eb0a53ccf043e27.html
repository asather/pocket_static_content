<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man who was critically wounded in a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/11/Mount-Oliver-police-respond-shooting-Brownsville-Rd-Rustic-Avenue-man-shot/stories/202005110110" target="_blank">shooting in Pittsburgh’s Knoxville neighborhood Monday night</a> died of his injuries at a Pittsburgh hospital overnight, according to city police.</p>
<p>Authorities are investigating the death as a homicide, city police spokesman Chris Togneri said. The man’s identity and cause of death are pending release by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office.</p>
<p>Officers found the man with gunshot wounds to his torso and legs after responding around 6:30 p.m. to reports of shots fired in the 700 block of Brownsville Road in Knoxville on the border with Mount Oliver Borough. Police administered aid until EMS arrived. The man was taken to the hospital in critical condition, police said.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred as the man was in his car leaving a parking lot on Brownsville Road. He then got into a verbal confrontation with another driver who was coming into the lot, Mr. Togneri said. A person in the second vehicle fired several shots at the victim before driving away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city’s ShotSpotter system also detected shots fired near the 200 block of Alice Street around the same time. Alice Street is one block away from the 700 block of Brownsville Road, but police said it is still unclear if the two incidents are connected.</p>
<p>Police are investigating.</p>
