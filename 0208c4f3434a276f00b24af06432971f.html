<h1>NFL bars player and team personnel travel in free agency</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NFL has barred in-person interviews with free agents and is requiring local physical examinations for them rather than team-conducted exams.</p>
<p>In a memo sent to the 32 franchises on Monday, the league also banned travel by team personnel to meet with free agents as well as those players traveling to team facilities. The league’s business year begins Wednesday, and the period in which players’ representatives could negotiate with clubs began Monday — though no deals could be finalized.</p>
<p>All offseason activities such as meetings, practices and minicamps have been delayed indefinitely as a safeguard against the new coronavirus. No players can enter a club facility through March 31, with the exception of those receiving medical treatment.</p>
<p>The restrictions were first reported by ESPN.</p>
<p>The NFL’s business year is just beginning, as planned, despite the spread of the new coronavirus. For now, all moves are being done remotely with basically a ban on travel within the league.</p>
