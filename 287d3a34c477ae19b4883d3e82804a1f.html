<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: Is the Steelers' defense too reliant on turnovers?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> Can the Steelers’ defense duplicate all of those turnovers they caused last year?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> It will be difficult to do that. Turnovers are <em>caused</em> to some degree, but there is also an element of luck to them. There are the forced ones and the ones where the ball bounced perfectly to the defense. In general, it is not a sustainable way for a defense to exist. I think the Steelers will force some turnovers but not as many as last year and they will rely on making plays. I’m excited about this defense because I do think it has a chance to be dominant.</p>
<p><strong>Hank:</strong> I read the other day that Ben Roethlisberger is short-arming the ball when he throws. Is this true? Is this a bad sign that he isn’t healthy?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I have no idea what that means. The videos of him that I have watched seem to show him throwing the ball with his normal motion. Are they writing that he doesn’t look healthy? That could mean a lot of things, but all I can go by is what our beat reporters have said, as well as the coaches. And by all indications he seems to be healthy and progressing at a good pace. I have to laugh, though, when I hear something like this as if whoever wrote it is some sort of NFL scout or medical expert. I’m going to trust he is throwing just fine.<br><br><strong>Joe:&nbsp;</strong>Do you think Pirates manager Derrick Shelton is John Russell version 2.0? He was given an awful team, but that doesn't make him a good manager, either.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong>&nbsp;How can we tell? This team is awful. I mean, this would be a team that would struggle to get to 60 wins in a normal season. It is hard to tell. But I do know this — he has far more personality and fire than Russell. That energy and enthusiasm he brings will rub off on his players on some level. Russell had none of that, so Shelton is already ahead of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Pelosi’s eyebrows, @eddykrutch:</strong> Will the Big Ten cave and reverse its decision on football?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I would be very shocked. They are already trying to appease the angry mob by scheduling games in January. They can’t reverse their decision because if they do, they will have to admit it was an overreaction and that they used bad data to reach a decision. No way that happens. I don’t know if the ACC and SEC are right, but I do know they are right to take a wait-and-see approach to it all.</p>
<p><strong>Degenerate Gambler, @defenerateyinza:</strong> Do you think Ryan Switzer is set for a breakout year?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Let me think about this one. Um, no. He is a good person and he is apparently good friends with the quarterback, but other than that I have no idea why he is going to make the team. He was a great college player who just isn’t quite good enough to make an impact in the NFL.</p>
<p><strong>Tyler:&nbsp;</strong>Why does MLB and the NHL allow players to "opt out" after they have already agreed to come back and play? If they didn't want to play, they should've opted out before the start.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I will quote Mike Tomlin: “We want volunteers, not hostages.” That about sums it up. How can you keep someone around who doesn’t want to be there? If a guy’s heart isn’t in it, I wouldn’t want him around as a teammate, anyway. You can’t win with someone who isn’t all-in. You just can’t. The other thing is everyone is so on edge about the COVID-19 stuff that if a league tried to tell a guy he has to stay and play, it would be a horrible public relations move. There is no way that could happen, and if a league made a guy stay and he got sick it would be a disaster. Every league knows it has to do everything right to keep a season going, and so minimizing these kinds of battles/headaches is the best path. If a guy wants to go, you have to let him go.</p>
<p><strong>Charles:</strong> You are a hack because you don’t know anything about health and safety protocols and Tom Wolf. When you wrote that column didn’t you just show us your bias towards wanting sports as a sports writer?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I’ll translate this: “You are a hack because you wrote a column I disagree with and I’m not intellectual enough or open-minded enough to read it and consider it is OK to be open to an alternate view.” Boy you are a deep thinker, I can tell. Now, as for my bias toward sports, well, you swung and missed more than the Pirates lineup on that one. My only bias is as an American citizen who looks at numbers and data and risk factors and wonders why we aren’t letting high school kids play sports. Whether or not the PIAA plays this fall has zero to do with my job, and seeing as I have no kids who are school age any longer, it has less effect on my life.&nbsp;</p>
