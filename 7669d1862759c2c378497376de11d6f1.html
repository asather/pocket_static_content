<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Movie theaters aren’t even close to reopening, but studios are already scrambling to find room for their blockbusters.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. announced Monday a redone schedule of movies for 2021, shifting releases back to account for production delays due to the coronavirus shutdown.</p>
<p>“The Batman,” starring Robert Pattinson as the Caped Crusader alongside Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, Paul Dano as the Riddler and John Turturro as Carmine Falcone, has been moved from June 25, 2021 to Oct. 1, 2021.</p>

<p>The “Sopranos” prequel movie, “The Many Saints of Newark,” has been delayed from Sept. 25 to March 12, 2021.</p>
<p>“King Richard," which stars Will Smith as the father of Venus and Serena Williams, shifts from Nov. 25, 2020 until Nov. 19, 2021, and Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis Presley movie, starring Austin Butler and Tom Hanks, moves a month to Nov. 5, 2021.</p>
<p>“Shazam 2” has also been pushed from April 1, 2022 to Nov. 4, 2022, while “The Flash” moves up a month from July 1, 2022 to to June 3, 2022.</p>
<p>Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” (July 17) and the “Wonder Woman” sequel (Aug. 14, after already being delayed) are staying put for now.</p>
<p>The movie calendar has been upended by the coronavirus pandemic, with summer blockbusters shelved or delayed until the fall and winter with the hopes that normalcy will have returned by then.</p>
<p>Among the biggest profile postponements are “No Time to Die,” “Fast and Furious 9,” “Mulan,” “Mission: Impossible 7\u2033 and “In the Heights.” Marvel has also restructured its entire schedule.</p>
