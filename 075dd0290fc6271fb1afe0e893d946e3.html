<h1>Warning issued for light rail crossing in Castle Shannon</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Castle Shannon police are warning motorists that a traffic gate at one of Port Authorityâ€™s light-rail crossings is malfunctioning and is being kept in the open position.</p>
<p>Police say the crossing, located at Willow Avenue and Grove Road, had been coming down even when the T was absent. Since the gate was backing up vehicle traffic, police said they are temporarily keeping it upright.</p>
<p>Authorities are telling motorists to approach that intersection with caution and look both ways before crossing. Police said the red flashing lights are still working and are reminding drivers to treat the signals as stop signs.</p>
<p>The light-rail operators also have been told to stop before crossing Grove Road and to yield to vehicle traffic.</p>
