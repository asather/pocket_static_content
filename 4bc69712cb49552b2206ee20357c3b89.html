<h1>Port Authority to clean vehicles, stations more frequently due to COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority will clean its buses and light rail vehicles every three days, and “high-touch surfaces” in transit stations will be disinfected every day beginning Thursday instead of once a month out of&nbsp;“an abundance of caution” during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>In a news release Thursday, the agency said the surfaces that will be disinfected will include&nbsp;poles, pull cords, hand straps, the tops of seats, fare boxes, ConnectCard machines, escalator handrails and elevator buttons. ACCESS paratransit vehicles that provide individual travel for elderly and disabled passengers will be cleaned daily.</p>
<p>CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman said the agency has updated its plan for dealing with a pandemic over the last few weeks. It waited until it had the proper supplies and personnel available to begin additional cleaning.</p>
<p>If it has to activate the pandemic plan, all vehicles and stations would be cleaned daily.</p>
<p>“The safety of our customers and employees is always our top priority, and we are committed to doing what we can until this situation is contained,” Ms. Kelleman said. “Before making this decision, it was critical for us to make sure that we had the supplies and employees available to keep up.”</p>
<p>Spokesman Adam Brandolph said much of the work to clean vehicles and stations will be done by employees working on overtime, which could be a "significant" cost to the agency if it continues for an extended time. The agency will keep track of those costs in case they can seek state or federal reimbursement in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to the more frequent cleaning schedule, the authority has placed hand-sanitizing dispensers at its Downtown Service Center on Smithfield Street and light rail stations at Steel Plaza, Wood Street, Gateway and North Side. More will be installed as supplies become available.</p>
<p>The authority also has distributed educational material to employees about proper hygiene and hand-washing procedures. Hand sanitizer will be distributed to employees who deal with the public when it is available.</p>
<p>The agency also has canceled all nonessential travel and postponed four public engagement meetings to discuss future transit plans.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelleman also encouraged riders to do their part by following proper hygiene and hand-washing recommendations.</p>
<p>“While we’re doing our part to protect the communities we serve, riders are strongly encouraged to follow the personal hygiene tips provided by the Allegheny County Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help keep themselves and their fellow riders healthy,” she said.</p>
<p>The agency also recommended riders who could be asked to work from home to be thoughtful about the transit products they purchase. For example, it might be wise to buy passes of shorter duration or use a prepaid ConnectCard so they don’t lose credit when a pass expires before they can use all of its value.</p>
