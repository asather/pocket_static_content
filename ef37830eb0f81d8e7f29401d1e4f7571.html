<h1>Sneaker industry stands strong in wake of COVID-19, looting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>From COVID-19 shutdowns to the rise in civil rights rallies, the streetwear and sneaker industry has found itself at the center of both crises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The appetite for limited-edition footwear and clothing by big brands hasn’t waned as the new coronavirus has spread. In fact, the demand helped make these businesses a target in recent weeks as looting marred protests against the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So where does the industry go from here? It depends upon where you look and whom you ask.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This has forced a lot of businesses to acknowledge the Black community instead of just making money off the Black community. That’s always been a problem,” says Denier Watson, who goes by his artist name, Javed.</p>
<p>He owns the streetwear store Senseless in Bloomfield with his brother, Romie, as a way to&nbsp;“take high-quality and high-end clothing and make it affordable for kids who want to be fly,” he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said he and his brother try to be examples for these kids, particularly young people of color who want to start their own business or get involved in the fashion industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We didn’t have anybody who looked like us in the position we’re in,” says Mr. Watson, who grew up in the Hill District.&nbsp;“That’s why we connect with the youth. We’re in our 20s. We hope kids in high school can literally look at us and say,&nbsp;‘They’re just a few years older than us, and they look like us and talk like us.’”&nbsp;</p>
<p>He noted that Nike had shared an anti-racism statement on social media, and its competitor, adidas, had retweeted it as a symbol of solidarity. Foot Locker and DTLR | Villa stores — many of which were vandalized and robbed during protests — temporarily closed locations earlier this month to honor Mr. Floyd during the week of his memorial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Watson hopes more big brands will turn their social media posts into action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think some businesses are just trying to save face and give the politically correct answer,” he says.&nbsp;“There should be more opportunities for women of color and men of color as far as leading designers for these big brands. There’s definitely been growth, but it’s still not enough.”</p>
<p>James Whitner, owner of The Whitaker Grp — which includes street fashion stores A Ma Maniere, Social Status, APB and Prosper — echoed this sentiment in an op-ed he penned for <a href="https://www.complex.com/style/2020/06/james-whitner-call-to-action-streetwear-sneaker-industry" target="_blank">Complex.com</a>. He believes streetwear and sneaker brands can be catalysts for change in their communities and beyond.</p>
<p>“The Black contribution to that industry is so big, there has to be some sort of give back to the Black community,” says Mr. Whitner, a Pittsburgh native now based in North Carolina.&nbsp;“Over the last two to three years, we’ve started making community a huge part of our business.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>He’s billed it as The Whitaker Project and created several flagship community programs — “Free Game,” a platform where Mr. Whitner leverages his personal network to provide community education opportunities;&nbsp;“Bag Talk,” a program focused on financial literacy;&nbsp;“Fight With Rights,” a voter education series; and&nbsp;“Women Within,” hands-on workshops and monthly meet-ups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The whole goal is to wrap our arms around and help our target market get access to information so they can be better,” he says.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>There’s no clear answer why sneaker and luxury streetwear stores were targeted nationwide by looters. In Pittsburgh, DTLR on Wood Street, Downtown, and the Downtown location of Mr. Whitner’s store Social Status were affected. Eight storefronts under The Whitaker Grp umbrella were impacted across the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several hundred dollars worth of clothing was stolen from Senseless in March right after the storefront was ordered to temporarily close because of COVID-19. Workers at Refresh PGH, which sells vintage sneakers, stood outside their store in Garfield for 48 hours following the Downtown protests on May 30 to protect it, says owner Baldwin Dawkins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some chalk it up to the high demand for designer sneakers. Several local store owners said they noticed little to no dip in sneaker sales while their brick-and-mortar locations were closed during the pandemic, with online shopping staying steady. Stores and websites that source designer sneakers are now on high alert for stolen merchandise to make sure stores aren’t sourcing any for their inventory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others say the answer isn’t so simple.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to speculate on why people have done it,” Mr. Whitner says.&nbsp;“With peaceful protests, there’s going to be some runoff that isn’t as positive as the protest. But the protests send such a loud message that I’m OK with the damage that’s been done. If that needs to happen for everything in this country to move forward, that’s something I’m willing to deal with.”</p>
<p>Mr. Dawkins thinks the streetwear and sneaker industry can serve as a common ground for bringing people together. That’s how he met his Refresh PGH business partner, Sean Devine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We had a mutual interest in Jordans [Nike sneakers]. We built a relationship, and we come from two different cultures, but sneakers brought us together,” Mr. Dawkins says.&nbsp;“I feel like we can use that example to bring together people around the world.”</p>
