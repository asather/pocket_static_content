<h1>Why buy new? You can buy an original at the Pittsburgh Antiques Show &amp; Sale</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you’re an antiquer looking for a bargain, you’ll find plenty at the Pittsburgh Antiques Show &amp; Sale on Feb. 15-16 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel Pittsburgh South in Bethel Park.</p>
<p>This is a good time to buy antiques, according to second-generation dealer Joan Rudolph, one of about 40 dealers at the show.</p>
<p>“The market is definitely soft. The Moe Bridges lamp I will be showing would have sold for $2,500 20 years ago in the bat of an eye,” said Ms. Rudolph.</p>
<p>It will be listed at the show for $1,250.</p>
<p>Hours at the show are 9-10 a.m. for early birds ($12) and 10 a.m.-5 p.m. ($7) general admission on Feb. 15. The next day’s hours are 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Information: 412-734-5279 or <a href="http://www.pittsburghglassclub.org" target="_blank">www.pittsburghglassclub.org</a>. The show is organized by the Pittsburgh Glass Club, which will have a special glass display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This show has amazing dealers and great deals,” Ms. Rudolph said.</p>
<p>This antiques veteran advises buying what you like, not what you think will be worth more someday. The antiques market fluctuates nearly as much as the stock market, she said.</p>
<p>“So many of the things I have bought I thought would be my retirement — that is how I convinced my husband — but they certainly won’t be our retirement.”</p>
<p>Ms. Rudolph said one reason for the market lull is that many collectors are older now and are either buying fewer pieces or have died. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It is a buyers market,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Rudolph said her parents turned antiquing from a hobby to a full-time job after they retired. They would purchase entire estates and then sell what they knew was valuable. They often gave away what they could not sell. She gave an example of how collectors’ tastes change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We would purchase beautiful brass beehive candlesticks for $75 each because we knew they could get $100 or $125 apiece for them. I don’t buy those brass candlesticks anymore because the market for them is not there.”</p>
<p>Brass is out of vogue, she said, and stainless steel is what most people are after.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Things that we once donated are now valuable,” Ms. Rudolph said. “When we would purchase an estate, we would throw Pyrex into bins that would be donated to thrift stores. Now some of those pieces are bringing in $1,000.”</p>
<p>Millennials and Generation Z are gravitating toward Pyrex and kitchen appliances as well as mid-century modern and industrial items, she said.</p>
<p>She and her parents tried to sell only things that came under the definition of a true antique, which is something at least 100 years old. “Now I sell Pyrex and I just can’t believe it.”</p>
<p>In the antiques business, “you are constantly getting an education so you never truly become an expert,” she noted.&nbsp;“There are just so many different areas of study and facets to antiques so you are constantly learning.”</p>
<p>As a child she found it stimulating. She and her brother would go to auctions with her parents and each get $5 to spend.&nbsp;“Back then you actually could buy something collectible and interesting for $5.”</p>
<p>Her love of collecting began with miniature bisque dolls.&nbsp;“When I was 12 a woman came to our house and purchased some of the bisque dolls I had bought and I was so thrilled,” she said, noting that she made $50.</p>
<p>It is the thrill of the hunt that many collectors enjoy. &nbsp;But that, too, has changed.</p>
<p>“You used to go home and look things up and now people do it right there on their phones at an auction,” she said. “They see this is on eBay for $50.”</p>
<p>It goes both ways, however, since dealers use the online auction site to price and buy as well.&nbsp;“Boy has the internet changed things.”</p>
<p>Ms. Rudolph’s home was once filled only with antiques, but times change and so did she.&nbsp; Her daughter has filled her home with new things.</p>
<p>“It’s funny. She calls me and asks me to find antique books even though she could find a new leather-bound book.”</p>
<p>Antique books are some of the biggest bargains, she said.</p>
<p>“A new leather-bound book might be $125. A beautiful antique leather-bound book from the turn of the century would be $30.”</p>
<p>Ms. Rudolph noted that many young collectors depend on <a href="/Pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest.com</a> and <a href="/Etsy.com" target="_blank">Etsy.com</a> to find their heart’s desire.</p>
<p>“If you are a young person and you find something you love, this is the time to buy,” she said. “So much of what they see on Pinterest and Etsy are new versions of things they can get at antiques shows for less.”</p>
