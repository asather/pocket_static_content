<p>NEW YORK — Convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein has tested positive for coronavirus, just days after he started his 23-year state prison sentence, according to a published report.</p>
<p>The movie mogul, who turned 68 on Thursday, is one of two inmates infected by COVID-19 at Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, just outside of Buffalo, according to the Niagara Gazette.</p>
<p>A jury convicted Weinstein last month of committing a criminal sexual act and third-degree rape for sexually assaulting his former production assistant Miriam Haley and raping actress Jessica Mann.</p>
<p>Weinstein was sent to Rikers Island right after his sentencing, then went to Bellevue Hospital with chest pains. After returning to Rikers, he was transferred from the jail’s North Infirmary Command to Wende on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He’s since been placed in isolation, the Niagara Gazette reported, citing officials connected to the state prison system. Officials believe he had the coronavirus before arriving at Wende, the paper reported.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision couldn’t confirm Sunday whether Weinstein has been sickened with the fast-spreading infection.</p>
<p>“The Department cannot comment on an individual’s medical record. However, we can confirm that two of the Department’s approximately 43,000 incarcerated individuals, both at Wende Correctional Facility, have confirmed cases,” said DOCCS spokesman Thomas Mailey.</p>
