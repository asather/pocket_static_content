<h1>Carnegie museums, others reopening</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh reopens its four museums on June 29. Visitors will be admitted every half hour with timed tickets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consortium runs The Andy Warhol Museum and the Carnegie Science Center, both on the North Side, plus the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History in Oakland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the four museums will operate at 25 percent capacity “so we can manage the flow of people in the buildings at any given time,” said Steven Knapp, president and CEO of the nonprofit. He added that all visitors must wear masks.</p>
<p>“We’re hoping that even if we have to shift back into the yellow stage, we can make the case that we are operating safely,” Mr. Knapp said.</p>
<p>“We have been developing policies to ensure the safety of employees and visitors,” he said, adding that museum employees will undergo daily temperature checks.</p>
<p>Each museum will have clearly marked foot traffic patterns, enhanced cleaning and plexiglass shields at visitor services desks.</p>
<p>On the weekend of June 26-28, the four museums will be open only to those who have memberships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When the four museums closed on March 14, we had to furlough employees because we had no revenue coming in,” Mr. Knapp said, adding that for every month it was closed, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh lost $1.4 million in revenue.&nbsp;When the museums reopen to the public June 29, they will have been closed for 15 weeks. Some of the 630 employees who were furloughed are being recalled while galleries are being disinfected and stocked with hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>During the closure, Mr. Knapp and 29 cultural leaders in Allegheny, Fayette and Westmoreland counties discussed how to handle safety issues concerning buildings, visitors, employees and volunteers, communication and inclusion.</p>
<p>“There is a very large uncertainty about how many people are going to come back and return to institutions like ours while&nbsp;the pandemic continues and there is not yet a vaccine for COVID-19,” Mr. Knapp said.</p>
<p>The Carnegie Science Center will host a summer camp for children, but summer camps at the art and natural history museums in Oakland are canceled.&nbsp;For information on each museum, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.warhol.org" target="_blank">www.warhol.org</a>, <a href="http://www.cmoa.org," target="_blank">www.cmoa.org,</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cmnh.org" target="_blank">www.cmnh.org</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.carnegiesciencecenter.org." target="_blank">www.carnegiesciencecenter.org.</a></p>
