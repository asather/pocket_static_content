<h1>PIAA Class 2A wrestling semifinals: Six WPIAL wrestlers advance to championship matches</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>HERSHEY, Pa. — With only 11 WPIAL wrestlers reaching the quarterfinal round in Class 2A, it seemed like 2020 would be a down year for the district at the PIAA individual wrestling championships.</p>
<p>Funny how quickly that narrative went out the door.</p>
<p>Six of the seven WPIAL wrestlers competing Friday night in the Class 2A semifinals won their matches to advance to Saturday’s championship finals, including four who lost in the semifinal round a year ago. Five of the six will be seeking their first PIAA championship, while Frazier senior Thayne Lawrence is attempting to capture his third title in a row.</p>
<p>“I think it is [an advantage],” Lawrence said about having experienced the pressure of the state finals before. “I’m going to go out there, be calm and wrestle my match and score points.”</p>
<p>Despite missing a significant portion of the season with a shoulder injury, Lawrence (24-0) has been nothing short of dominant every time he’s stepped on the mat this year. Friday night was no different, as Lawrence cruised past Commodore Perry’s Gage Musser on his way to an 18-1 technical fall.</p>
<p>Awaiting Lawrence in the championship, though, will be the toughest opponent of his career in what is likely the most anticipated match of the entire weekend.</p>
<p>Notre Dame-Green Pond senior Andrew Cerniglia (46-1) won a state title a year ago at 145 pounds and is ranked No. 4 in the nation at 160 pounds by Intermat Wrestling. Lawrence, meanwhile is ranked No. 3 nationally. Cerniglia reached the final with an 8-1 decision against Benton’s Nolan Lear.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a good test to see where I stand,” Lawrence said. “It’s going to be a really good match … this is what I wrestle for.”</p>
<p>The WPIAL’s only other top seed besides Lawrence in Class 2A, Ellwood City senior Austin Walley (44-1), secured his first trip to the championship with a hard-fought 5-3 decision against Penns Valley’s Andrew Sharer.</p>
<p>“I think I need to open up a little bit more, but all in all, I wrestled fairly smart, got a couple takedowns, got away, and won the match,” Walley said.</p>
<p>Walley was one of four WPIAL wrestlers who lost in last year’s semifinals to earn a spot in Saturday’s championships. The others are South Park junior Joey Fischer (44-2) at 113 pounds, Elizabeth Forward senior Ryan Michaels (45-2) at 120 pounds and Burrell junior Ian Oswalt (45-6) at 132 pounds.</p>
<p>Fischer got the party started with a 4-0 decision against Brookville’s Owen Reinsel to clinch his first berth in the finals. There, he’ll face Reynolds’ Gary Steen in a rematch of last year’s third-place bout, which Steen won in the ultimate tiebreaker period.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely history between me and Steen,” Fischer said. “If I can get that one back, that’s always a goal.”</p>
<p>Michaels followed that up with perhaps the most exciting match of the night involving a WPIAL wrestler, as he scored a reversal late in the third period to pull out an 8-6 decision against Notre Dame-Green Pond’s Brandan Chletsos.</p>
<p>“Usually I love it when people put in legs,” Michaels said. “That’s one thing I work big on is getting out of that stuff. I’m comfortable in there.”</p>
<p>At 132 pounds, Oswalt scored a first-period takedown against Brockway’s Anthony Glasl and stifled Glasl’s attacks the rest of the way to claim a 3-1 decision win. His Buccaneers teammate, junior A.J. Corrado (45-7), punched his first ticket to the state finals with a nail-biting 3-2 win against Penns Valley’s Malachi DuVall.</p>
<p>“I think I’m going to wrestle the hardest I’ve ever wrestled in my life [tomorrow] probably, because this is the biggest moment in my life as of right now,” Oswalt said.</p>
<p>Both Oswalt and Corrado will have a chance to avenge losses from last month’s Southwest regional finals. Oswalt faces returning state champion Brock McMillen of Glendale, while Corrado will battle St. Joseph’s Catholic Academy’s Caleb Dowling.</p>
<p>“I feel like I wrestled a little nervous at regionals, but I’m going to try to get into more of my offense,” Corrado said. “It should be a brawl.”</p>
<p>Along with the six finalists, eight other WPIAL wrestlers secured a spot on the podium through the consolation bracket, giving the district 14 medalists in Class 2A.</p>
