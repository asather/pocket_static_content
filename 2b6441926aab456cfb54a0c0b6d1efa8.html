<h1>Mt. Lebanon board to consider shifting to hybrid learning </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Mt. Lebanon School Board on Monday is expected to consider transitioning education of the district’s students in a hybrid model of in-class and remote learning.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, parents were asked to fill out a survey on whether they wanted their children to continue remote learning via the district’s cyber academy or shift to the hybrid model. Those results, which were expected by Thursday, will enter into their consideration.</p>
<p>Superintendent Tim Steinhauer said at the meeting that remote-learning classes, which started Aug. 31, could shift to the hybrid model Oct. 5.</p>
<p>Mr. Steinhauer said the survey results also will help to determine staffing needs at both the cyber academy and for in-person instruction.</p>
<p>Because COVID-19 numbers in Allegheny County and Mt. Lebanon are trending toward the bottom of the incident rate and percent positive rate, Mr. Steinhauer said he felt “more comfortable” recommending the hybrid approach.</p>
<p>But if local incidence rates increase, he said, the district may have to move back to fully remote instruction.</p>
<p>In the cyber model, students would be divided into two cohorts and would attend school in person two days per week and three days remotely.</p>
<p>At the secondary level, the plan would be to have all students follow their current bell schedule and remain with their current teachers — whether they choose to stay with online learning or come to school in person two days a week.</p>
<p>“Our teachers have become very comfortable livestreaming classes,” said Ronald Davis, assistant superintendent of secondary education. “Students in online courses will be participating or viewing their classes live. We believe the teacher-led experience is probably the best model for us to follow.”</p>
<p>Online teachers will also be using asynchronous learning tools.</p>
<p>When students return to the buildings, masks will be required at all times, and students should self-screen for COVID-19 symptoms before coming to school. Students will also have to maintain 6 feet of distance between one another.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis said when physical distancing isn’t feasible, barrier boards will be used on desks. Additionally, the administration is looking at staggering the course of the day so that traffic in the hallways is minimized and students do not congregate in any one area.</p>
<p>For students who choose the cyber academy, it will essentially be the same as the current remote learning instruction, and students will continue to follow the same schedule with the same teacher.</p>
<p>“Nothing’s really going to be different,” Mr. Davis said. “The teacher simultaneously will be attending to students in front of them while at the same time attending to students that are livestreaming or tapping into their classroom.”</p>
<p>At the elementary level, assistant superintendent Mary Beth Irvin said they are leaning toward a schedule that would be two days in person, one day remote learning, and two days of asynchronous online learning.</p>
<p>She also indicated that about 700 students have expressed interest in being in the cyber academy at the school, which may pose a challenge for staffing, and students may not have the same teacher they currently have.</p>
<p>“Clearly, students who opt for the cyber academy will not be having the same teachers,” Ms. Irvin said.</p>
<p>“This is going to be a transition for us,” she said but added the administration is working to make sure it is a smooth one.</p>
<p>“Our kids are resilient and flexible, and our teachers are caring and concerned.”</p>
<p>Information on the hybrid model can be found on the district’s website, www.mtlsd.org. The board vote is expected during the Monday meeting, which begins at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The board also is scheduled to take up a motion to censure member Michael Riemer, who was heard uttering profane remarks on an open microphone before the start of Monday’s meeting conducted via Zoom.</p>
<p>Mr. Riemer, a retired Mt. Lebanon Police officer who worked as a school resource officer in the Mt. Lebanon district for several years prior to serving on the board, apologized multiple times for “any crudeness that may have slipped out.”</p>
<p>“I want to apologize for the extremely inappropriate language that I used this evening before the board meeting. There is no excuse for this egregious lapse of judgment. I deeply and sincerely apologize to our families, community members, district staff and my fellow board members for my behavior,” he said.</p>
<p>Board President Sarah Olbrich released a statement saying, “To the community, I apologize for the behavior of Mr. Riemer tonight. His language was unacceptable and unbecoming his position. It will not happen again.”</p>
