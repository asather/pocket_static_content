<h1>Quantum Theatre teases announcement of in-person outdoor events</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Quantum Theatre leader Karla Boos, whose productions have taken theatergoers from lake shores to abandoned bath houses to historical landmarks, has heralded the coming of&nbsp;“a season of live events,” at an outdoor site or sites to be named later.</p>
<p>In an announcement that included the naming of Quantum’s Stewart Urist as executive director, with founder Boos retaining the artistic director title, she said,&nbsp;“We’ll soon announce a season of live events that will gather people in vast, outdoor circumstances, and move forward from there in hope,” she said, adding that the details will come in a live virtual event at 7:30 p.m. June 24.</p>
<p>While we wait, Quantum will present the online event, “Love and Information” by Caryl Churchill. “Married or otherwise cohabitating couples” will perform the play for two actors from June 18-21.</p>
<p>“You’ll see acting by actors who can be close to each other, touch, ACT. Ha ha, you’ll also see their houses, cats, and children,” Boos wrote.</p>
<p>Quantum’s season finale, “Chimerica,” that was scheduled to open June 5, was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.quantumtheatre.com/" target="_blank">www.quantumtheatre.com</a>.</p>
