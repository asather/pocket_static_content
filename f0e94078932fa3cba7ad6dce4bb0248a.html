<h1>Penguins mailbag: Top five Penguins of all time and biggest All-Star snubs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Welcome back to Mike’s Mailbag (Patent still pending)!</p>
<p>Every other week, I beg you to send me questions online and then I answer the best ones here in this segment. My bosses call it reader engagement. I just like the idea of making you do half my job for me.</p>
<p>Need dating advice? Problem with a coworker? Anything else floating around inside that noggin? Nothing is off limits. Of course, I do cover the Penguins, so hockey questions are also very much encouraged. All I ask is that you keep them fun, funny and interesting. If you have a question, tweet me @MikeDeFabo, slide in my DMs or send me an email at mdefabo@post-gazette.com.</p>
<p>Let’s rip it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lisa N.:</strong> Which Penguins players won the fantasy football league this year? Also, who has been the locker room DJ with Brian Dumoulin out?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> No one cares about anyone’s fantasy football team. But Matt Vensel thought you might care about the Penguins’ league. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/10/13/Penguins-are-dealing-with-injuries-on-the-ice-and-in-fantasy-football/stories/201910130188" target="_blank">It’s worth a read if you </a>haven’t check it out yet. If nothing else, it proves professional athletes are just as bad at playing fake football as you and I.</p>
<p>I did some investigative journalism and followed up with Zach Aston-Reese. Apparently, the team co-owned by goalie Casey DeSmith and injured defenseman Justin Schultz was defeated in the championship by the strength coach, Alexi Pianosi. I’ll just assume Schultz spent his entire time on injured reserve raiding the waiver wire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your second question: Dumoulin left the team a Spotify playlist so he can still be the DJ even while he’s on the D.L.</p>
<p><strong>Joe B.:</strong> In ranking all-time Penguin greats (meaning what they accomplished as a Pen), I think most people would have the same top four and probably almost the same order. So, who slides in at No. 5? (I came up with 66, 87, 68, 71, 29).</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I agree that there’s not much debate when it comes to the top four. Mario Lemieux, Sidney Crosby, Jaromir Jagr and Evgeni Malkin lead the Penguins in every major statistical category, including goals, points and assists. There’s a case to be made that Malkin has already leapfrogged Jagr into third. He’s already ahead of No. 68 in games played, assists and — most importantly — Stanley Cups.</p>
<p>But getting back to your question … Ron Francis makes a strong case. He helped raise the 1991 and 1992 Stanley Cups and ranks sixth in Penguins history in points (613) and fifth in assists (449). Jean Pronovost, who played 10 years in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s and 1970s, is fifth in goals (316) and seventh in points (603). Rick Kehoe, who played 11 years in Pittsburgh in the 1970s and 80s, is fifth in points (636) and sixth in goals (312).</p>
<p>But I agree with you. It’s Marc-Andre Fleury. He leads the Penguins in every important goaltending stat. He has almost 150 more wins than Tom Barrasso, 131 more games played and twice as many shutouts. Oh, and don’t forget about those three Cups and his affable personality.</p>
<p>I’ll also give you a dark horse: Kris Letang. Though he can be a lightning rod among the fans, Letang is one of the most unique defensemen in the league. Earlier this year, he became the first Penguins defenseman to tally 400 career assists. With 524 points, he ranks ninth all-time in Penguins history. At this pace, he’ll rank top-five in points in another two or three seasons. Might be worth revisiting this question in a couple years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chris C.:</strong> Lots of intrigue down the stretch run here. Possibility of player movement, acquisition or demotion? Thoughts and insight on what they do going forward?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> My gut feeling says the Penguins get a forward who can make a difference. Coming into this season, I already felt like the Penguins didn’t have enough top-six caliber wingers. Now the best one, Jake Guentzel, is out. Sure, if they stay healthy, the Penguins could get by with Jared McCann on the wing (even though he’s proven his value at center). But if this injury-plagued team takes another hit, they’ll really be hurting in the top six.</p>
<p>Just look at what happened when Dominik Kahun missed Tuesday’s game in Philadelphia, for example. The Penguins struggled offensively and Brian Elliott pitched the easiest shutout of his career with just 19 saves. I say it’s time to pull the trigger as insurance, if nothing else.</p>
<p>In terms of demotions, it feels like Sam Lafferty, Joseph Blandisi and Andrew Agozzino are sitting right on the roster’s fringe. Alex Galchenyuk also might have to keep scrapping to stay in the lineup on a nightly basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chris C.:</strong> Best arena/worst arena to visit?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Another good question from Chris. I’m still only halfway through my first season covering the NHL. But one arena I’d like to experience as a fan is Calgary’s Scotiabank Saddledome, the oldest venue in the league. Apparently, the beers are extra strong for some mysterious reason. The locals call them Saddle Beers or Dome Foam. Some people say it’s because the nitrogen makes them hit you harder than carbon dioxide would. Others say, all the kegs are in the basement and the beer is re-fermented in the old lines on the way to the upper deck. I think it might have something to do with the altitude.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’d love to go to a game and — um, shall we say — experience it like a local. Imagine a Hunter S. Thompson, gonzo journalism-style story about a night at the Saddledome that quickly goes off the rails. I’ll try to pitch that one to my editors next year. We’ll see if I remain employed.</p>
<p><strong>Frank D.:</strong> Tristan Jarry and Kris Letang are both deserving of their All-Star game nods. But who is the biggest snub from the Penguins?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>Bryan Rust has a strong argument here. He’s already set a new career high with 21 goals … and there are still 32 more games to add to it. Only 16 players have found the back of the net more through the first 50 games. And you have to consider that Rust missed the entire first month of the season. What would his stats look like if he played all 50?</p>
<p>But the biggest snub has to be Malkin. I don’t know why, but it seems like he never gets the proper recognition around the league. He ranks sixth in the NHL with 1.35 points per game. And even though he missed about a month, Malkin is still tied for 16th in the league with 50 points. If he can stay healthy in the second half and continue to produce at this level, Malkin should easily finish the season as one of the league’s top 10 point-getters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lynn G.:</strong> Mike Sullivan said that Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin are the best 1-2 punch in the league. I don’t really like violence. Is there a food analogy you can make instead?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>Peanut butter and jelly? Sticking with my Italian schtick, spaghetti and meatballs? Tomato soup and grilled cheese? I don’t know. I like Sullivan’s description better.</p>
<p>Well somehow, we found our way back to food, like we always do. That means it’s time for lunch, and for me to log out here. Matt Vensel will have his weekly chat next Thursday. I’ll be back on Feb. 6.</p>
<p>Until then, remember: There’s no such thing as a stupid question, only stupid people asking them.</p>
