<h1>'I hope to be an inspiration': Jarrod Dyson's upbringing sets stage for mentor role</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. —&nbsp;It only took one day for people in Pittsburgh to become acquainted with how center fielder Jarrod Dyson speaks his truth.</p>
<p>“Ain’t too much out there right now,” Dyson told reporters hours after signing a one-year, $2 million pact. “You would love to explore, but at the same time, you have to take what you can, take the good with the bad and roll with it. Make the most of it.”</p>
<p>Some fans appreciated the honesty from Dyson. Others were taken aback by the brazen statement. No matter how you felt about the quote, it is essential to know more about the man behind it.</p>
<p>Dyson fell in love with baseball at the age of 4. But access to the game didn’t come easy for a kid from public housing in rural Mississippi, in a community known as “The Bricks.”</p>
<p>“It was rough, but sports kept us out of a lot of trouble,” Dyson told the Post-Gazette. “You have to have a strong mind to get out of where I come from. People say that I’m brash because I speak my mind, but when you come from the projects like I did, you don’t have a choice. It can be like a trap if you aren’t mentally tough. There’s a lot of drugs and bad things happening.”</p>
<p>Dyson lived with his three older brothers and was raised by his mother. While the family didn’t have a lot of money, Dyson made up for it in creativity. The Dyson kids played sandlot baseball and learned how to create makeshift equipment.</p>
<p>“If you messed up and left your broom or mop on the porch, we were taking it. That was our bat for the day,” Dyson said. “We’d take the broom or mop part off, and we were okay to play. Or we would go into the woods. If we’d find a stick with a nice handle, that’d be the bat.”</p>
<p>Dyson couldn’t afford the fancy showcases and travel teams, but it didn’t stop him from fervently pursuing the game.</p>
<p>“I loved it. I still do love it,” Dyson said. “That’s why I’m still here. I love playing baseball. I love showing up every day and doing the work. I’m thankful for everything I have gained from this game.”</p>
<p>Dyson learned that tennis balls were much cheaper and easier to acquire than baseball. He figured out if you cut the fuzzy green cover off the ball, it was easier to grip.</p>
<p>Dyson could throw a slider or changeup with the rigged tennis ball. The other kids could throw pitches with movement and they’d be able to play for hours.</p>
<p>“We loved it, Dyson said. “We were always looking for ways to improve. We were hungry. Whatever it took to play. We would find a way.”</p>
<p>Jerry Hill, the father of Dyson’s three older brothers, became a father to the future World Series champion. To this day, Dyson still calls him Dad. Hill pushed Dyson as a young man.</p>
<p>“He loved sports, and he knew what they could do for a kid,” Dyson said. “He would pack up the cooler with water and Gatorade and take us to the park. We’d play ball then go swim. We did that all the time.”</p>
<p>Dyson says his fielding ability comes from those days. There would be a universal pitcher, and whoever got the ball to make an out got to hit. Dyson would utilize his speed to make the catch and take his turn at the plate. He says those days made organized baseball easy for him.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, man, I feel like I should catch every ball that comes my way,” Dyson said. “There isn’t anybody in my way. I’m supposed to get that ball easy.”</p>
<p>Now as Dyson’s career enters its twilight, he wants to contribute more on and off the field.</p>
<p>“There are some talented young men on this team who want to be great,” Dyson said. “My goal is to drop as much knowledge on them as possible. If I can come from where I came from and be on a championship team, then they can, too. I’m thankful for what this game has taught me. So I can’t be selfish with all of this knowledge.”</p>
<p>Dyson got drafted in a round that doesn’t even exist anymore by the Kansas City Royals in 2006. There were over 1,400 players selected before the Royals took Dyson in the 50th round. Baseball cut the rounds to 40 back in 2012.</p>
<p>It took Dyson three years on the big league club to make the starting roster. In spite of it all, he never quit and reached the pinnacle of the sport. A kid that grew up in the projects has a street named after him in that town. Dyson is a walking testimony, one that the Pirates could use.</p>
<p>“I hope to be an inspiration,” Dyson said. “I want to spread my little wings and encourage these guys. I want us to grow together.”</p>
