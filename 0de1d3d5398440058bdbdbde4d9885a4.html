<h1>Pirates mailbag: Is there reason to have hope in 2020?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Greetings from the Sunshine State. Baseball is back in session, and we're looking live from Pirate City. Welcome to the Pirates mailbag. This season, yours truly will run the mailbag. Jason Mackey will man the weekly chats. Please send your questions to nwilborn@post-gazette.com or Twitter @nwilborn19.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chris Jenkins:</strong> Nubyjas, everyone is predicting doom and gloom for the Buccos this season. Is there anything to be positive about with this team?</p>
<p><strong>Nubyjas Wilborn:</strong> Sure, there's always positivity if you choose to look for it. Josh Bell is a great hitter and is the type of player you want as a leader. Bell is growing as an athlete and a man, and his maturation is worth watching. Bryan Reynolds had a strong season in 2019 and could become a great player. Kevin Newman made an unexpected leap last year. There's also a chance that Trevor Williams, Chris Archer, Mitch Keller, and Joe Musgrove will get better working with new pitching coach Oscar Marin. I'm not saying that the Pirates are going to win the World Series, but they aren't going to lose 100 games, either.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Wright:</strong> Are the Pirates going to start the season with Jacob Stallings, Luke Maile, and John Ryan Murphy as the catching crew?</p>
<p><strong>Nubyjas Wilborn:</strong> Maybe? Pirates general manager Ben Cherington noted that the team would be still be looking to fill positions. We'll see if they find a catcher, but if they had to go with Stallings getting a lot of run, they could make it work. Stallings is a sound defensive catcher and his bat started to come along last year. Who knows what another year working with hitting coach Rick Eckstein will do for him?</p>
<p><strong>Ron Witman @ronwwitman:</strong> What is the situation with the signing of a free agent? What about Keone Kela and Kevin Kramer for a Joc Pederson?</p>
<p><strong>Nubyjas Wilborn:</strong> I believe that we'll see a signing or two before the end of camp. Most likely a center fielder, maybe a catcher, as well. As to your trade question: Why would the Dodgers do that? Kela has closer-type stuff, but teams would want to see him be healthy for a while before they'd make a trade. I'm also not sure how Kramer would fit with the Dodgers.</p>
<p><strong>JW @silkychubs:</strong> Manuel Margot was just traded. Apparently, the Joc Pederson to the Angels deal is dead. Why isn't Ben Cherington looking to make deals for these types of players instead of trying to sign a retread type like Kevin Pillar or Cameron Maybin or a Billy Hamilton before he signed in SF?</p>
<p><strong>Nubyjas Wilborn:</strong> Who's to say that Cherington wasn't in on conversations about a Pederson type? Or that he can't get in on them now? We're still learning how Cherington operates. Maybe he values defense over Pederson's 36 homers but with a low batting average. Also, signing a player like Pillar or Maybin jives with Cherington consistently saying that 2020 was evaluation within the organization. You trade for Pederson when you're a bit more ready to run than where the Pirates seem to be.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen @stephennn_:</strong> With Murphy having an option to opt-out of his contract if he goes to AAA, could the Pirates keep him on the MLB roster and send Maile down instead? Also, which non-roster invitees could make the team?</p>
<p><strong>Nubyjas Wilborn:</strong> A good GM always considers things like player options when it comes to building the roster that goes north to break camp. So yes, that could be a factor for John Ryan Murphy. There could be a scenario where Murphy starts the season in Indy and Murphy splits time with Stallings.</p>
<p>As for your second question: Derek Holland and Robbie Erlin come to mind. Holland could very well end up being the fifth starter. Erlin could earn a spot in the bullpen. Socrates Brito is an intriguing outfielder who could find his way on the roster as well.</p>
