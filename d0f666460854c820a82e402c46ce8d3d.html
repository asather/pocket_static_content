<h1>WPIAL schools have until September to make fall sports decisions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>To play, or not play? WPIAL schools have a week to decide.</p>
<p>The WPIAL board of directors met Monday afternoon at the Chartiers Valley School District administration office and determined that schools must notify the league office by Sept. 1 if they do not want to participate in fall sports. The WPIAL announced its deadline three days after the PIAA <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/highschool/2020/08/21/piaa-fall-sports-approval-gov-tom-wolf-recommendation/stories/202008210121" target="_blank">voted to conduct all fall sports</a>, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Many schools have already decided they will play fall sports. But superintendents and school boards at some schools plan to make a decision this week.&nbsp;The WPIAL might have to adjust fall sports schedules if schools choose not to participate. Earlier this month, Uniontown <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-football/2020/08/04/uniontown-cancels-football-fall-contact-sports-2020-covid-19-pandemic-wpial/stories/202008040089" target="_blank">decided not to participate</a> in football and boys and girls soccer, while Summit Academy also elected not to play in football and boys golf, the only fall sports the school sponsors.</p>
<p>The fall sports in the WPIAL are football, boys and girls soccer, boys and girls cross country, girls volleyball, boys and girls golf and field hockey.</p>
<p>“At this point, we haven’t heard from any more schools,” WPIAL executive director Amy Scheuneman said. “Certainly, some are discussing it, but we haven’t heard of a lot that will choose to cancel.”</p>
<p>Fall sports practices for all schools in Pennsylvania began Monday. Golf teams can begin competitions Thursday, while the first play date for girls tennis teams is Aug. 31. The first play date for football is Sept. 10, while girls volleyball, soccer, field hockey and cross country teams can begin competitions Sept. 14.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon’s football team shut down until Sept. 2 because a player tested positive for COVID-19. Due to the shutdown, Mt. Lebanon canceled a scrimmage against Upper St. Clair and also postponed the first game against Baldwin Sept. 11. Under PIAA rules, which the WPIAL follows, a football team must go through five heat acclimatization days of practice and 10 more days of practice before it can play a game.</p>
<p>Scheuneman said the WPIAL has put out guidelines to work with health departments of what should occur when an athletes tests positive for COVID-19. This summer, some teams in the WPIAL have shut down workouts for two weeks when an athlete has tested positive or been exposed to the virus.</p>
<p>Many coaches and athletic directors have wondered what will happen if a team has to call off a game because an athlete tested positive. The WPIAL decided Monday that, for right now, the games will be declared a “no contest” and not a forfeit.</p>
<p>But what if the game is a conference or section matchup that counts toward playoff standings? The WPIAL would hope games might be rescheduled, but it’s hard to reschedule a football game and play possibly three games in seven or eight days.</p>
<p>“The whole point right now is to try to get teams to play,” Scheuneman said. “Safety is first, competition second and playoffs could be a potential bonus for those who play. But we don’t people to circumvent the rules or try not to play a scheduled contest. We want everyone to make the best effort to play as many games as they can. We don’t want to penalize a team with a forfeit that might not have been their fault.”</p>
<p>Scheuneman said steering committees for all WPIAL fall sports will meet at the end of September or early October to address the “no contests.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see where we are and potentially develop how teams qualify for the playoffs based on who is in, because you’re going to potentially have schools opting out,” Scheuneman said. “You might have a section with all eight teams playing, and another with only three. … We will have to evaluate what has happened over the course of a month before making a determination on how playoffs will be determined.</p>
<p>“We don’t have all the answers. I don’t think anybody has all the answers right now. But we don’t want people to focus on making the playoffs right now. We want them to focus on being safe and just playing.”</p>
<p><strong>2021 playoff format</strong></p>
<p>The WPIAL still hasn’t decided on a football playoff format for this season, as far as the number of qualifiers. That will be determined if there are PIAA playoffs. But the WPIAL on Monday approved a format for the 2021 football playoffs.</p>
<p>Class 6A will have five playoff qualifiers (only eight teams are in the classification). In Class 5A and 3A, 12 teams will qualify for the postseason. Class 4A will have 14 playoff teams, Class 2A 16 and Class 1A 15.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility rulings</strong></p>
<p>The WPIAL had four eligibility hearings with student-athletes.</p>
<p>• The WPIAL ruled Kyrell Hutcherson ineligible in basketball for one year at North Allegheny after he transferred from Kiski Area. The WPIAL felt the move was partly for athletic intent, which is against WPIAL and PIAA rules.</p>
<p>Hutcherson’s hearing was closed to the media, but Scheuneman said, “There were a number of things that were said, so there could’ve been a number of things that came into each person’s decision on the board.”</p>
<p>Hutcherson, a junior, was a Big 56 all-section selection last year as a sophomore at Kiski Area. Detrell Hutcherson, Kyrell’s father, said the family will appeal the decision to the PIAA.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Joseph Miller was ruled eligible for all sports after transferring from St. Joseph’s to Kiski Area.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Matt Aulicino transferred from Freeport to Central Catholic and was already ruled eligible for the regular season. But he was ruled ineligible for the postseason under new PIAA rules.</p>
<p>Aulicino appealed the postseason decision, and the WPIAL ruled him eligible for the playoffs in both football and basketball. Aulicino is a 6-foot-6 senior.</p>
<p>Scheuneman said the reason for the ruling was an employment situation in the family caused a move.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The WPIAL denied postseason eligibility to Shannon Watkins, a volleyball player who transferred from Geibel to Laurel Highlands.</p>
