<h1>Good to-go: New restaurants are opening despite the pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s been three weeks and a day since Nicki Cardilli and her partner, Justin Fitzgerald, officially opened the doors to The Coop Chicken and Waffles. Eager customers quickly lined up down the block, but she couldn’t hold back the tears.</p>
<p>“Who opens a restaurant in a pandemic?” she asked.</p>
<p>Ms. Cardilli and Mr. Fitzgerald started The Coop as a food truck in 2016 and quickly earned a loyal following for chicken and waffles based on the recipes of Mr. Fitzgerald’s Texas kin. A brick and mortar restaurant was the logical next step and they signed a lease in May 2019 for a snug North Side spot nestled on the corner of Federal and East Ohio streets. After extensive remodeling, they were on the cusp of an April opening when the world tilted.</p>
<p>“It’s been a lot. We have kids and it’s affected the whole family,” she said. “We were like, we just have to push through and we’re gonna open.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Aug. 14, they finally did. And remarkably, so have others in the dogged determination of a dream, with an eye toward a post-pandemic future. But they are also clear-eyed about the fallout of COVID-19, which Eater recently described as “a mass extinction event for restaurants.”</p>
<p>One in three U.S. restaurants —&nbsp;as many as 220,000 of the nation’s roughly 660,000 eateries —&nbsp;may close permanently this year, according to restaurant consultants Aaron Allen &amp; Associates.</p>
<p>Christian Schulz, a chef and longtime musician, uses the coda symbol as a metaphor for his 2020 experience. The musical notation looks like crosshairs and marks the end of one section of music and the beginning of another that brings the piece to a conclusion.</p>
<p>To wit: He and his partner and co-chef, Rebecca Nicholson, signed a lease March 1 for a space on Brookline Boulevard to open Menuette, a “finer diner” or affordable neighborhood restaurant that combines diner classics with some of the refinement and technique they’d learned while working in top kitchens in Pittsburgh and elsewhere. The Dormont couple ran Menuette as a popup at the Korner Pub in Mt. Lebanon for two years, developing their own ardent fans. A permanent home only made sense.</p>
<p>“We’d been looking for a long time in this neighborhood specifically,” Mr. Schulz said. And when COVID hit, “I think like most Americans we were like, it’ll be OK.... And about a week later we were like, “we’re [expletive].”</p>
<p>They put a full stop and completely reimagined their concept.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, we weren’t open yet. We didn't have employees yet. We didn’t have inventory or a lot of the huge overhead that the bigger restaurants do. So we kind of looked at that as an opportunity to be like, ‘Let’s see what we can do that makes sense.’</p>
<p>“It just felt like there wasn’t a place for Menuette in the world anymore. It was just sort of a gut thing.... Why push forward with this idea that is now totally irrelevant? This idea doesn’t matter anymore, so let’s do something that matters. And that matters to us. We’re here all day every day and we want to have fun and enjoy ourselves.”</p>
<p>They landed on Oak Hill Post — O HI! for short —&nbsp;selling gourmet sandwiches to go.</p>
<p>“It was actually pretty liberating because it was like we can do whatever the [heck] we want.... Let's do what we want. As long as we’re making people happy, that’s all that matters.</p>
<p>“Our job is to feed people, make ‘em happy, give ‘em great service. And do it fast. So that’s kind of our thing here. Make really good food. Make it at an accessible price point, get it to ‘em quick and safely.</p>
<p>Their food has been enthusiastically received in the neighborhood and he and Ms. Nicholson have no regrets.</p>
<p>“100% positive. No time to be negative. I’m not gonna come into work every day pissed off about something I can’t control. I’ll put my mask on but I’m smiling underneath it.”</p>
<p>They aren’t the only ones: After a pandemic delay, Karl Horn has reopened Tootie’s Italian Beef sandwich shop, relocated from the South Side to Downtown. In Sharpsburg, 2 Sisters 2 Sons has drawn rave reviews for their Caribbean food, and even the tiny new Mount Oliver Gyro Shop is finding footing selling Greek fare along Brownsville Road, just down from the new Cuddy’s soul food.</p>
<p>Although they’re smaller operations heavily dependent on takeout business, larger endeavors designed around sit-down service are opening as well in the fall. Mediterra Cafe has announced plans to open a second location on Beverly Road in Mt. Lebanon. Acclaimed chef Jamilka Borges will open Wild Child in Millvale, and Matt Porco of Sienna Mercato will get back to his roots with a pizza restaurant on the South Side.</p>
<p>In Friendship, the trio of Cecil Usher, Cat Cannon and Will Randell opened St. Clair Social in mid-August in what was the longtime home of the Sharp Edge,</p>
<p>Mr. Usher and Ms. Cannon own Mindful Hospitality, a consulting firm for bars and restaurants. After they were approached by the building's owners to develop a concept for the space, they took their time studying approaches and protocols of what has and hasn’t worked around the country.</p>
<p>The questions they pondered: “Do we want to run a bar? Do we want to do that during a pandemic?”</p>
<p>The need existed for a neighborhood place, which Mr. Usher knew first hand; he lives nearby. Mr. Randell, who previously worked at Acorn in Shadyside and Meat &amp; Potatoes in Downtown, was brought on board to design a menu of upscale pub fare.</p>
<p>Though they are only doing food, beer and cocktails to go right now, they are building a rapport with neighbors for a long-term establishment.</p>
<p>“We are using this as an unorthodox way to open a restaurant,” Mr. Usher explained. “We are doing it very small and organically, but we’re adding new items each week. We’re getting people excited and keeping interest alive in our industry and just having fun.</p>
