<h1>Nursing homes restricting visitors following federal mandate</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nursing homes around the region are halting visitations following a mandate from the&nbsp;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>The mandate came as President Donald Trump declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency on Friday. Seema Verna, CMS administrator, announced Friday that CMS would issue guidance to&nbsp; nursing homes to restrict all visitors and non-essential personnel to slow the spread of the virus. Local nursing homes are now following suit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nursing homes also announced they are taking measures to screen visitors for symptoms, recent travel history and potential contact with people who may have COVID-19.</p>
<p>For some homes, the restrictions have gone into effect immediately. Others are being rolled out over the weekend.</p>
