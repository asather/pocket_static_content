<h1>Riverhounds bracing for the first of three critical, playoff-shaping games against Hartford Athletic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Near the end of the 26 minutes Bob Lilley spoke to reporters Tuesday came a moment of levity. Were the Riverhounds, the team’s coach was jokingly asked, planning on pursuing Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi, who had reportedly informed Barcelona that he wants to leave the club?</p>
<p>“No, we’re not signing Messi,” Lilley said matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>Alas, the Riverhounds will have to enter the most important stretch of their season without the most transformative player of his generation, and perhaps in the game’s history, at their disposal. It doesn’t do anything, though, to diminish what the next several weeks of an abbreviated season represent.</p>
<p>On the heels of a disappointing 2-2 draw with Saint Louis FC, Lilley’s team travels north to face Hartford Athletic on Friday, one of three matches the Riverhounds have against their intra-division opponent in their final seven contests. How they fare against Hartford will not only have an outsized say in how the rest of their season transpires, but one year after securing the eastern conference’s top seed for the USL Championship playoffs, the Riverhounds’ three matchups with Hartford could very well determine which of the two teams will finish first in their group and, thus, get a more preferential playoff draw.</p>
<p>“Whenever you’re playing teams that are potentially in the playoff picture, the results matter,” Lilley said. “It’s a big moment for us. We’ve obviously put ourselves in a decent position in our group. We’ve let some points get away, but I still feel like if we have a good week next week, we’ll be in a good position to compete for our division. Look, we’re not trying to just make the playoffs. We’re trying to end the season strongly so we have momentum.”</p>
<p>As it stands now, the two clubs are tied atop the USL’s Group F standings with 16 points apiece. A crucial distinction exists, though, beyond what Lilley believes is an easier schedule that Hartford has faced thus far — the Riverhounds have played two more matches than Hartford, which adds even more urgency to get a win in their first meeting of the season. The next-closest team in the standings, New York Red Bulls II, has just six points, making the race for the group’s top seed a two-horse race barely halfway through the season.</p>
<p>The difference between a first- and second-place finish is notable, even in a season in which home-field advantage doesn’t matter as much due to reduced seating capacities at many venues in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The group’s first-place finisher wouldn’t face the burden of traveling for a first-round game and would get to play against the second-place team in Group E, currently Saint Louis FC and its 14 points, instead of the first-place squad, Indy Eleven (with 19 points).</p>
<p>“Right there, it’s significant,” Lilley said.</p>
<p>After going 8-21-5 in 2019, placing it 18th among 19 eastern conference teams, Hartford has improved dramatically in its second season as a club, sitting at 5-1-1 through its first seven matches. It has leaned heavily on a talented attack, one that has scored 16 goals and successfully converted 22% of its shots, tying it for fifth among 35 USL Championship teams. It has, as Lilley sees it, a crystalized identity and a clear (and effective) way of playing.</p>
<p>There’s a level of gamesmanship that goes into the trio of games, as well, a balance that needs to be struck. Beating Hartford on Friday is a priority, of course, but with two more games against it, there’s a reasonable question of how much they want to give away tactically, lest it hurt them for future meetings.</p>
<p>Lilley said his team won’t show everything, but he also acknowledged that this first game, given the playoff picture, is too important to not trump whatever sense of restraint he might feel. There’s enough that can change between this first game and their next one, on Sept. 12, that whatever unfolds on Friday may only mean so much strategically in the future. Besides, Lilley said he and his staff don’t have any shortage of ideas.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, you’ve got money in the bank and you’ve got to spend it at some point,” Lilley said. “You can’t always save for a rainy day. It may not rain for a while.”</p>
<p><strong>Help on the way</strong></p>
<p>While it may not be Messi, the Riverhounds do have a potentially helpful addition to their front line. Lilley said Tuesday that striker Albert Dikwa, who joined the club this month, is with the team right now and is currently undergoing testing for COVID-19. He won’t be available for the Riverhounds’ game Friday, but Lilley said he may come off the bench in either the Sept. 1 game against Loudoun United FC or Sept. 5 at New York Red Bulls II.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old native of Cameroon, who spent the past two seasons with Saint Louis FC, has played 66 games at the USL Championship level going back to 2017, recording seven goals and five assists in that time.</p>
<p>“He’s a little bit more of a movement guy,” Lilley said. “Steevan Dos Santos runs well for a big guy. So does Ropapa [Mensah]. But they’re more target players. They want balls to feet. I think having another player that knows how to get in behind and unbalance defenses with their movement, it will open spaces for others. I think he gives us a lot more flexibility in our attack.”</p>
