<h1>Joe Starkey: Ben Roethlisberger wasn’t perfect — but the Steelers would have lost without him</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I’m not here to tell you Ben Roethlisberger played a great game Sunday.</p>
<p>I am here to tell you the Steelers would have lost that game last season without him.</p>
<p>Yes, Roethlisberger's terrible third-quarter throw gave the Denver Broncos life. And yes, he was lucky to avoid an interception in the end zone.</p>
<p>He also passed for 311 yards and two spectacular touchdowns in his first home game since his elbow fell apart against the Seattle Seahawks a year ago, and his team won the game, 26-21.</p>
<p>That part’s important.</p>
<p>Two series after his errant pass to Broncos safety Justin Simmons changed momentum, and one series after Denver cut the Steelers lead to 17-14, Roethlisberger took his team 75 yards in nine plays, going 7 for 7 for 68 yards.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, sevens were everywhere Sunday …</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Roethlisberger had his 62nd 300-yard game, tying Brett Favre for seventh on the NFL’s all-time list.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;He passed Eli Manning to move into seventh place all-time in passing yards.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;His idol and inspiration for wearing No. 7, Broncos GM John Elway, watched from a box at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>Among those seven completions on what amounted to the winning drive, Roethlisberger converted a fourth-and-2 pass to JuJu Smith-Schuster and finished with a flourish, scrambling right and firing on the run 28 yards to Diontae Johnson in the end zone.</p>
<p>“This is vintage Ben Roethlisberger,” said CBS analyst Rich Gannon.</p>
<p>If not for three drops (unofficial count), Roethlisberger would have finished 32 of 41 for something like 350 yards, two touchdowns and a passer rating over 100.</p>
<p>As it was, he went 29 of 41 for 311 yards and a 98.5 rating. A lot of teams would take that kind of performance from their quarterback. The Steelers were dying for anything close to it as their 2019 season disintegrated.</p>
<p>You do remember they scored precisely one offensive touchdown in eight of their final nine games, right?</p>
<p>You do remember they got precisely zero 300-yard passing games, right?</p>
<p>Roethlisberger has been here so here so long, it already feels like he never left. Please don’t forget what it was like when he left. His defense sure hasn’t.</p>
<p>Asked on CBS what it’s like to have Ben back, linebacker T.J. Watt said, “It’s huge. To have an offense that can move the ball and help us rest and get recovered, is huge.”</p>
<p>Points are good, too. The Steelers have scored 52 in their first two games. They scored 53 in their final four games last season.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger was in full fall-on-sword mode on his postgame Zoom call with reporters. Five times in his first three answers, he delivered some version of, “I didn’t play well enough.”</p>
<p>How about that touchdown pass to Johnson?</p>
<p>“Actually wasn’t a very good throw,” Roethlisberger said. “He made a great play on it.”</p>
<p>What was the issue in going 2-for-12 on third downs?</p>
<p>“Me just not playing well enough.”</p>
<p>OK, but there was a pretty good first-down play that helped the Steelers win: Ben to the Rookie Monster — Chase Claypool — for 84 yards and a 14-3 lead.</p>
<p>Ben credited Claypool, of course, but go back and watch the throw. A blitzing linebacker took a free shot at Roethlisberger’s waist as he delivered an absolute strike 46 yards high in the air down the left sideline. Claypool caught it in stride.</p>
<p>One guy on this roster makes that throw. Not a ton of guys in the league make that throw.</p>
<p>As Claypool put it, “Ben put it in a perfect spot for me. ... I just had to run under it, and it was right there for me.”</p>
<p>After last season, nobody around here is in any position to complain about wins. And even if the Steelers had lost, the story of this game was Roethlisberger’s return to Heinz Field and how, even if he wasn’t perfect, he proved again he’s back.</p>
<p>“He’s made a couple of big throws today,” Gannon said after the scoring pass to Johnson, “certainly showing the arm is well-healed.”</p>
<p>Remember, too, that the right side of Roethlisberger’s line was completely new, his running game sputtered, and it was just his second football game in the past year.</p>
<p>Look around the league. Several teams, including the Broncos, might have seen their season turn with crushing injuries Sunday.</p>
<p>The Steelers know what that’s like — so forgive them if they’re perfectly happy to leave “not well enough” alone.</p>
