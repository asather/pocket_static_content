<p>Allegheny Health Network said on Tuesday that patients are now allowed one designated adult visitor during their stay, but the person will be screened for any health issues and must wear a mask.</p>
<p>Clergy visitations are allowed in addition to the one visitor.</p>
<p>Visitation hours will not be limited when the patient is under 18, or has a cognitive disability or behavioral issues, AHN officials said.</p>
<p>Also, visitations are not limited for labor and delivery patients or patients receiving end-of-life care.</p>
<p>Patients being treated for COVID-19 will not be allowed visitors except for end-of-life circumstances, when two visitors will be allowed.</p>
