<p>The James Taylor/Jackson Browne tour, scheduled for PPG Paints Arena on June 16, has been postponed due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>“As this summer’s tour of 27 towns and cities across the US drew near, we’ve been increasingly excited to hit the road again,” the artists said in a statement.&nbsp;“So it’s deeply disappointing for both of us to have to call it off and reschedule (and reschedule we WILL)! As we all now realize, COVID-19 is a serious, real and present danger. Moreover, our public health is all of our responsibility. So let us listen to and follow the directions of our public healthcare people and support their efforts in this unprecedented time of global pandemic. Love those around you and, above all, stay safe and healthy.”</p>
<p>Browne tested positive for the coronavirus last month, but reports are that he had mild symptoms.</p>
<p>The legends are hoping to reschedule the tour, possibly in the late summer, pending the advice of health officials.</p>
<p>Previously purchased tickets will be honored for all new dates and fans are encouraged to hold onto their tickets. Questions should be directed to the point of purchase.</p>
<p>Arena concerts by Reba McEntire, Roger Waters, Ringo Starr and Justin Bieber have all been postponed.</p>
