<h1>Game of the week: Bell tolls early and often for Penn-Trafford in win</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dinggg! Dinggg! Dinggg!</p>
<p>That’s the loud sound echoing throughout Warrior Stadium after every Penn-Trafford touchdown, extra point or field goal. After any score, it’s tradition that a group of Penn-Trafford’s cheerleaders ring a huge bell that sits on the sideline near the home bench.</p>
<p>Woodland Hills left Penn-Trafford on Friday night all dinged up.</p>
<p>Woodland Hills couldn’t get the ringing out of its ears because that bell tolled often. On a perfect, crisp night for football, with a full moon shining, Penn-Trafford shined with a 38-6 victory in a WPIAL Class 5A Big East Conference game.</p>
<p>Penn-Trafford invoked the mercy rule with five minutes to go in the game, and the Warriors got to that point by using an impressive running game and taking advantage of five Woodland Hills turnovers, four in the first half. Penn-Trafford had two 100-yard rushers, churned for 340 yards on the ground and the Warriors ran their home winning streak to 21 games.</p>
<p>Woodland Hills, which had turned things around after starting 0-6 last season, dropped to 3-1 overall and 1-1 in conference. Penn-Trafford (3-1, 2-0), the Post-Gazette’s No. 4 WPIAL Class 5A team, is 3-1, 2-0, is looking like a team gaining traction after a loss to Peters Township in the second game.</p>
<p>“We didn’t freak out,” Penn-Trafford coach John Ruane said of the loss to Peters Township. “Peters is a great team, but we had a lot of self-inflicted wounds that night. We had seven turnovers, but we hung tight. I think that game was a big motivator for everybody and we practiced hard for two weeks.”</p>
<p>This game was virtually over at halftime as Penn-Trafford scored 24 points in the second quarter and took a 24-0 lead into the break.</p>
<p>Cade Yacamelli, a Penn-Trafford senior, did a little of everything for the Warriors. He rushed for 137 yards on 16 carries, scored two touchdowns, recovered a fumble and intercepted a pass. Quarterback Ethan Carr scored twice himself, threw for two touchdowns and rushed for 115 yards on 15 carries.</p>
<p>Woodland Hills, meanwhile, had only 202 yards offense and only 57 in the first half. Woodland Hills played without leading rusher Taelen Brooks (leg injury) and starting offensive tackle Julius Brown (shoulder injury).</p>
<p>“Losing two starters like them sort of puts a damper on things,” Woodland Hills coach Tim Bostard said. “But don’t take anything away from Penn-Trafford. They’re a fantastic team and have weapons all over the place.”</p>
<p>Woodland Hills quarterback Deontae Williams, under a heavy rush all game, threw three interceptions after not throwing one in the first three games.</p>
<p>Carr scored Penn-Trafford’s first touchdown, capping a 74-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown run.</p>
<p>Yaccamelli scored on a 1-yard run with 4:41 left in the half to make it 14-0.</p>
<p>Penn-Trafford’s Carter Green intercepted a pass and returned it 33 yards to the Woodland Hills with 1:14 left in the half. Two plays later, Penn-Trafford’s automobile connection came together when Carr threw an inside screen to Brad Ford, who took it 27 yards for a touchdown with 42 seconds left.</p>
<p>Williams was intercepted by Yacamelli on the first play after the kickoff and that led to Nathan Schlessinger’s 25-yard field goal on the last play of the half.</p>
<p>“It seems like every time Brad Ford touches the ball, he makes a big play,” Ruane said. “Cade Yacamelli has really come on and become a tremendous running back. Ethan Carr is a really dynamic dual-threat quarterback. We definitely have some guys who can do something with the football in their hands.”</p>
<p>Penn-Trafford scored again late in the third quarter when Yacamelli came out of the backfield and was all alone for a 5-yard touchdown pass from Carr. Penn-Trafford’s final touchdown came on Carr’s 5-yard run with 5:06 remaining.</p>
