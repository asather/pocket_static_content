<h1>Pirates can’t get past Cardinals in Derek Shelton’s first game</h1>

<p>ST. LOUIS — This was hardly an easy assignment for Joe Musgrove, starting on opening day in St. Louis, opposite Cardinals Jack Flaherty for Pirates manager Derek Shelton’s debut.</p>
<p>Musgrove should be proud of the work he did. The right-hander made some mistakes early but nearly got through six innings while giving his team a chance to win the game and for Shelton to earn his first win.</p>
<p>The issue the Pirates encountered was Flaherty, who was baseball’s best pitcher during the second half of 2019, going 7-2 with a 0.91 ERA.</p>
<p>On a steamy summer evening in St. Louis, as the Pirates’ nipped at the Cardinals’ heels, Musgrove lost the duel with Flaherty, and Shelton’s first win will have to wait, as Pittsburgh dropped a 5-4 decision at Busch Stadium.</p>
<p>“When you watch him live, you realize how good he is,” Shelton said of Flaherty. “You watch him on video and think he’s good, then when you watch him live, you realize why he’s pitching Opening Day for them.”</p>
<p>Flaherty used two very good breaking balls, including a devastating slider, and mixed them with a fastball that averaged 94 mph to keep the Pirates off-balance, showing why many are expecting big things from him this season.</p>
<p>The Pirates went down in order five times against the right-hander, who finished with a 2.75 ERA in 2019. They finally broke through in the seventh inning, as Jacob Stallings poked a two-out single through the right side of the infield — excellent work when facing a 96 mph heater.</p>
<p>“I thought the ability to execute not only his fastball but the changeup and slider today were really good,” Shelton said on Flaherty. “He was on point. He did not waste pitches. He was very efficient, and you usually don’t see that from a guy on Opening Day. He was really good.”</p>
<p>Josh Bell, Colin Moran and Jose Osuna had singles to load the bases in the seventh before Flaherty won a battle with right fielder Guillermo Heredia. An example of terrific pitch-sequencing: Flaherty used his slider to set up a full-count fastball and he froze Heredia with it. Stallings' hit was clutch, but not enough.</p>
<p>Flaherty worked seven innings and allowed those two runs on six hits, all singles. He didn’t walk a batter and struck out six. Osuna drove in the Pirates’ other two runs, as the Pirates rallied against newly minted Cardinals closer Kwang-Hyun Kim in the ninth.</p>
<p>“That’s what you’re gonna see a lot from us this year,” Musgrove said of the Pirates twice cutting the Cardinals’ lead to one run. “We have the guys. We have the bench guys who will come in and get the job done as well. As starters and pitchers, it’s just being able to keep this game within striking distance. Keep the game close and give our guys a chance on offense.”</p>
<p>The first run Musgrove allowed came in the bottom of the third inning — on a solo home run to Cardinals left fielder Tyler O’Neill, a pitch that Musgrove will absolutely want back.</p>
<p>Musgrove hung a 1-1 curve that O’Neill smacked into the Pirates bullpen.</p>
<p>“I really struggled to land breaking balls for strikes early in the game,” Musgrove said. “When you’re not able to do that, it makes it easier for them to lay off and hunt stuff in the zone a little better.”</p>
<p>Credit to Musgrove, he did something that’s not easy for any pitcher: He adjusted mid-game. One way Musgrove said he’s able to do that is by relying more on his sinker and changeup, which helps him recalibrate the timing of his delivery.</p>
<p>Musgrove was able to do that and worked 5 2/3 innings, allowing three earned runs on five hits while walking three and striking seven.</p>
<p>“They don't know if my timing is good or bad or if I'm trying to vacate the zone with stuff, so you've just got to not show that, stay confident in the pitch and continue to throw it,” Musgrove said. “You can't just abandon it. I'll go to it when I know it's a good pitch from me.”</p>
<p>Flaherty was perfect through three. The Pirates' first hit came when Kevin Newman lined a fastball to center field to open the fourth inning. The Pirates would get runners on first and second before Bell flew out to right and Moran struck out to end the inning.</p>
<p>Cardinals right fielder Dexter Fowler stretched St. Louis’ lead to 2-0 with his solo home run to start off the fifth, this time catching a fastball from Musgrove.</p>
<p>One of Musgrove’s most important throws actually did not come from the mound. With two outs in the bottom of the fifth, St. Louis second baseman Kolten Wong drove a ball to the gap in right-center field, directly between center fielder Jarrod Dyson and Heredia in right.</p>
<p>As Wong safely slid into third base, the ball trickled away from Moran. Wong thought he could score. Musgrove chased after the ball and slid. Wong stumbled while taking off for home, which gave enough time for Musgrove to get the ball to Stallings from his back side — out.</p>
<p>“That was a sick play,” Dyson said. “It just shows you he’s very athletic. Joe’s going to be great for us. We’re leaning on him.”</p>
<p>The Cardinals on Friday leaned plenty on Flaherty, as they should, and he came through for them. But with the way the Pirates responded in Shelton’s first game, they also showed a lot of resolve.</p>
<p>“I was happy with the way our guys played,” Shelton said. “We came up short, but we did a lot of good things tonight. I think that’s the thing. That’s the most important thing. We did a lot of good things [Friday].”</p>
<p><strong>Three more takeaways</strong></p>
<p>• Good for Shelton. He said he enjoyed the conversation on the bench and felt like his team had plenty of energy. The first-time manager also made sure to take a moment, breathe and soak it all in.</p>
<p>“I took a step back, I think, when we were out on the field for introductions,” Shelton said. “Then during the first inning, I really kind of soaked it in.</p>
<p>“It’s a unique fraternity. There’s only 30 of us in the world. As someone pointed out earlier, it’s a small list of guys who have managed in the big leagues. I took it in. I’m very humbled and honored to have this position.</p>
<p>“I didn’t let the moment go away. I made sure that I took it in. Because if not, my dad would have been really [ticked] at me.”</p>
<p>• Clay Holmes was not able to escape the sixth, as he was the one who gave up Molina’s single. However, it was a solid outing for him — 1 1/3 innings, two hits and a strikeout. Was certainly better than how Richard Rodriguez fared, as he gave up another home run.</p>
<p>Interesting answer on why Shelton went with Holmes in that situation, a move that would’ve been unimaginable in 2019: “First off, we’re not in 2019. I’m dealing with everything that’s current with our group. What we’ve seen out of Clay Holmes is the ability to execute pitches. I thought the next inning he went out and threw the ball really well.”</p>
<p>• The lack of crowd hardly contributed to a dead atmosphere. Fans partied atop the bar in left field. Another group watched from the ground floor of what looks like an apartment complex or office building. The Cardinals did an excellent job mixing all of the normal in-game presentation with the fact that there was nobody here.</p>
<p>“I was really happy with how they came out and their intensity and focus,” Shelton said. “I thought we did a good job. I thought our effort was good.</p>
<p>“It’s an adjustment for everyone. I thought the crowd noise, here in St. Louis, they did a nice job with that. It was a good atmosphere. It was a good game. If you like baseball, it was a good game to watch. It was well-pitched by both starting pitchers. They executed pitches when they had to. And we just ended up coming up short.”</p>
