<h1>Duquesne's Gormley on impeachment trial: 'Just clear partisanship'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Before the week that was, the 800-plus pages of Ken Gormley’s book on the impeachment of Bill Clinton stood as a harrowing chronicle of a bitterly-divided Congress that could barely agree on anything.</p>
<p>Now, after six consecutive days of partisan bickering and shameless showmanship in the Senate trial of President Donald Trump, Mr. Gormley’s volume reminisces of a time when the Senate was flawed, but came together when it was necessary to protect the institution.</p>
<p>“In fact, we’ve gone backwards” since then, Mr. Gormley said in his office at Duquesne University this past week, a copy of his Clinton book on the table nearby. “This was just clear partisanship, and on both sides as it began playing out. The whole tenor in the room was one of anger and disrespect.”</p>
<p>Mr. Gormley, president of the Uptown university and one of Western Pennsylvania’s leading scholars on constitutional law, attended the first day of Mr. Trump’s trial earlier this week —&nbsp;like he did the first of Mr. Clinton’s back in 1999 —&nbsp;and came back to Pittsburgh with a number of unsettling warnings for members of Congress, Mr. Trump’s lawyers and House impeachment managers.</p>
<p>As Mr. Gormley picked apart the constitutional arguments from a desk in his Old Main office, the television nearby showed a livestream of House managers presenting their case, showing a slide to senators that argued Mr. Trump’s alleged conduct —&nbsp;withholding congressionally approved aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into a political rival, then attempting to cover it up —&nbsp;is a “continuing threat” to the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s defense has argued, among other things, that impeachment requires a criminal offense, an argument that Mr. Gormley detests.</p>
<p>Impeachment “absolutely” doesn’t require a crime, Mr. Gormley said, adding that it’s “very clear the framers had in mind that impeachment was quite distinct from criminal conduct.” Mr. Gormley, citing Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, said impeachment results from an abuse or violation of public trust —&nbsp;a “political offense” threatening the well-being of the state.</p>
<p>“The whole crux of impeachment is removing someone because they are not fit for office,” Mr. Gormley said, deeming the Trump legal team’s argument “clever,” but not one that would ever win in federal court.</p>
<p>That the president’s legal team is arguing Mr. Trump can’t be prosecuted criminally —&nbsp;but that senators are not privy to the witnesses and documents that could lead to impeachment —&nbsp;is “not what the framer of the constitution had in mind at all,” Mr. Gormley said.</p>
<p>“Effectively, you’re saying you can’t get rid of me no matter what,” he said of Mr. Trump’s defense.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s team, in arguing that the White House has blocked the release of documents and its close advisers from testifying to protect the presidency, has cited executive privilege as to why characters like acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton cannot be forced to testify.</p>
<p>Executive privilege is not absolute, Mr. Gormley said. During the Clinton impeachment, the White House made tens of thousands of documents available, and Mr. Clinton himself agreed to be videotaped in grand jury testimony, he noted.</p>
<p>It’s “unprecedented” for a president to issue a blanket declaration that no one from the executive branch can comply with Congressional subpoenas or turn over documents, Mr. Gormley said.</p>
<p>“Executive privilege isn’t an all or nothing. It never is,” Mr. Gormley said. “You have to have a reason for saying that you’re not allowing someone to testify, and it’s usually little particular pieces of what they’re testifying about that could endanger national security,” Mr. Gormley said.</p>
<p>But Mr. Gormley said there is a “higher likelihood” than imagined that the documents and testimony will eventually see the light of day, considering there is strong public support for having witnesses. He noted that there were 41 witnesses in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, and three in Mr. Clinton’s —&nbsp;an agreement the parties came to.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to prohibit the testimony of Mr. Bolton, in particular, Mr. Gormley said, because he’s no longer a part of the executive branch and has indicated his willingness to testify. Mr. Gormley said Chief Justice John Roberts may have to rule on that eventually, and that both sides could agree to take the testimony in a secure setting to determine if there are any national security concerns.</p>
<p>The Democrats overplayed their hand, though, Mr. Gormley said, in demanding so many witnesses and so much evidence. A small number of witnesses should be called, he said, giving the public something new about the case.</p>
<p>The White House lawyers also have argued that the president has the sole authority over foreign policy, and that the decision to pause foreign aid rests squarely with the commander in chief.</p>
<p>Though he acknowledged the president’s powers on foreign policy are at their “zenith,” Mr. Gormley said that doesn’t give them carte blanche to do whatever they want, pointing to the Impoundment Act of 1974 that requires the executive branch to spend funds that are appropriated by Congress.</p>
<p>“Never is the president given unilateral power to make decisions having to do with executing the laws that Congress has passed,” Mr. Gormley said.</p>
<p>If he were defending Mr. Trump, Mr. Gormley said he’d advise his client to say he made a mistake, that he doesn’t plan on doing it again and that it wasn’t a great idea —&nbsp;but that it doesn’t warrant removal. The public generally agrees that it’s not okay to involve foreign governments in American elections, Mr. Gormley said, but the public is forgiving.</p>
<p>“I think the biggest mistake has been to focus on these kinds of empty constitutional arguments, instead of just coming right out and saying it doesn’t warrant removal because it was maybe some bad judgment on [Mr. Trump’s] part but presidents aren’t perfect,” Mr. Gormley said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gormley has advocated for both sides to agree to suspend the trial and work out bipartisan legislation making clear that moving forward, it’s not permissible for presidents and federal officials to use foreign governments to influence an election.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the trial risks doing permanent damage on the institutions of government, he said.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to remove a president if you don’t have that high threshold to do it. The framers put it in there,” Mr. Gormley said. “But you do have to make everyone look at the facts, let the evidence speak for itself, and then have the courage of your convictions to stand up for it and be prepared to explain to the voters why you believe that was the correct decision.”</p>
