<h1>Pitt RB Israel Abanikanda offers a glimpse of what's possible in 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pat Narduzzi was asked Wednesday morning about grad transfer tight end Lucas Krull, which the coach took as an opportunity to talk up a few more mid-year enrollees.</p>
<p>Freshman wide receivers Jordan Addison and Aydin Henningham were “spectacular” and “smart,” respectively, through a couple practices. Solomon DeShields, who could play either receiver or linebacker in the coming seasons, is “special.” And running back Israel Abanikanda apparently has “a different gear to him.”</p>
<p>Talk about foreshadowing. Two days after Narduzzi’s praise, Abanikanda showed off the speed that should put him in the conversation to be Pitt’s starting running back come the fall.</p>
<p>Abanikanda served up Friday’s eye-popping play, a 70-yard touchdown run through the heart of Pitt’s reserve defense during a live, full-contact period. Abanikanda side-stepped a blitzer in the backfield, cut right past another would-be tackler and burst upfield. The kid from Brooklyn who goes by “Izzy” turned his focus to the end zone.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to get caught from the back,” Abanikanda said smiling. “Just run. Just run.”</p>
<p>At Pitt’s South Side indoor facility, Abanikanda didn’t have the benefit of a Heinz Field video board to use as a rearview mirror. If he did, he would have noticed cornerback AJ Woods, one of the fastest players in the program, on his tail. But the freshman didn’t get tripped up. Instead, he kept pulling away.</p>
<p>Abanikanda <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2019/12/19/Pitt-football-signing-day-2020-Israel-Abanikanda-eying-instant-impact-with-Panthers/stories/201912190204" target="_blank">told the Post-Gazette in December</a> that he was “born fast,” and he proved it Friday. With his early impression in spring camp, he’s also backing up the “inner belief” he held as a verbal commit: the idea that he could make an immediate impact as a true freshman.</p>
<p>Pitt entered spring ball with a few positions in question. But right tackle won’t be answered with Gabe Houy sidelined. Linebacker is headed toward sorted with Phil Campbell moving to “Money,” leaving Cam Bright to start at “Star,” the other outside spot. Really, headway can be made at all positions, whether it’s first-team or backups. But slot receiver and running back are two spots many have a keen eye on.</p>
<p>At least at receiver, Pitt has one guy — Maurice Ffrench — to replace. It’s a clear task. Running back, meanwhile, was a jumbled mess in 2019. Last season, Pitt ranked 100th in rushing attempts per game and averaged 3.5 yards per carry. Only five Football Bowl Subdivision programs ran the ball less frequently and averaged fewer yards per tote.</p>
<p>Pitt offensive coordinator Mark Whipple suggested injuries played the primary factor. On Wednesday, he pointed out that AJ Davis, Vincent Davis and Todd Sibley — who combined for 70.8% of Pitt’s rushing yards in 2019 — all missed time throughout the season.</p>
<p>But Narduzzi attributed the toothless rushing attack to something else entirely.</p>
<p>“George Aston wasn’t there, Darrin Hall wasn’t there, and Qadree Ollison wasn’t there,” Narduzzi said, referencing an influential blocker and a pair of 1,000-yard backs who ran out of eligibility after 2018. “I hired Mark Whipple because I knew he could throw the ball. We were going to have to throw the ball well last year to have any success at all. Just because of what we lost. And I knew our playmakers, if we had any, were going to be at receiver. I knew they weren’t in the backfield right now. They would have to grow, and they’ve grown. And I think we’ll see a different running game with a different backfield this year.”</p>
<p>Maybe Abanikanda is that difference.</p>
<p>The former three-star prospect, per Rivals, ran track at Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn, N.Y.) and said he clocked a 4.45-second 40-yard dash, laser timed. Pitt’s run game could use that kind of pop.</p>
<p>As a true freshman, Vincent Davis showed off his speed on a few occasions, most notably a 61-yard wildcat touchdown at Georgia Tech. Still, the Panthers ranked dead-last in the ACC in rushing plays of 20-yards or more with nine. Pitt was one of eight teams at the FBS level to fail to reach double-digits in 2019. And V’Lique Carter, who accounted for two of those nine rushes, is in the transfer portal.</p>
<p>So yes, Abanikanda has a real chance here to provide some life.</p>
<p>Now, can he do everything else that’s required of a Power Five back? Abanikanda is through only three playbook installs. There’s much to learn from Whipple, his fellow backs and his position coach, Andre Powell. Abanikanda confirmed with a smile and nod that Powell, a no-frills veteran with three decades of coaching experience, has already yelled at him in film sessions.</p>
<p>Abanikanda noted that it’s all “out of love.” But freshman mistakes like not finishing runs or getting lazy about holding the ball high and tight have been called out. And they’ll continue to be.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, “Izzy” offered a glimpse of what’s possible in front of athletic director Heather Lyke, letterman Aaron Mathews, 2021 commit Nahki Johnson and, most importantly, his teammates, who hooted and hollered as they chased after him on his long run. It was a positive moment, something the freshman could hang his hat on. But it’s the rest of the spring (and summer and fall) that will determine if Abanikanda can build on that flash.</p>
<p>“We knew he was fast. We knew he was talented,” Narduzzi said. “So we’ll find out.”</p>
