<h1>Billy Price is nominated for two Blues Music Awards</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Dog Eat Dog,” considered by some to be the best album Billy Price has ever made, has been nominated for best soul blues album at the 41st Blues Music Awards in Memphis.</p>
<p>Price, the longtime Pittsburgh institution now based in Baltimore, is also nominated for soul blues male artist.</p>
<p>“Dog Eat Dog,” which was released in August, is the second album that Price has recorded with producer/guitarist Kid Andersen at his Greaseland Studios in San Jose, Calif.</p>
<p>“The thing that we talked about doing for this one was to offer a little more raw meat to the mainstream blues fans who go to the festivals and blues cruises,” Price told the Post-Gazette about “Dog Eat Dog.” “You'll hear a little more traditional blues-rock on this one, more things with the 12-bar pattern.”</p>
<p>Price won his first Blues Music Award in 2016 for “This Time for Real,” his collaboration with the late Otis Clay, and was nominated for 2018’s “Reckoning.” Although Price, a New Jersey native who arrived in Pittsburgh in 1970 after attending Penn State, moved to Baltimore in 2018, he’s made frequent trips back to Pittsburgh to perform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leading the pack with eight nominations, including band of the year and contemporary blues album, is Rick Estrin &amp; the Nightcats, the band that Andersen plays in.</p>
<p>The ceremony is at Memphis’ Cannon Center for the Performing Arts on May 7.</p>
