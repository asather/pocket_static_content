<h1>Allegheny County Council recognizes racism as ‘public health crisis’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County Council members spent much of their roughly 30-minute regular meeting expressing support or concern on a symbolic motion to designate racism as a public health crisis.</p>
<p>The motion’s language drew on data from the 2019 city-commissioned <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/09/17/Pittsburgh-black-population-better-life-quality-comparable-city-gender-equity-commission-race/stories/201909170114" target="_blank">report that revealed staggering disparate health and economic outcomes across race and gender</a>&nbsp;in Pittsburgh compared with its counterparts across the U.S. That University of Pittsburgh report became the basis of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/12/11/Pittsburgh-City-council-racism-health-crisis-pension-offset-Burgess-Harris/stories/201912110101" target="_blank">Pittsburgh City Council’s similar declaration</a>.</p>
<p>“This is not just a black issue; this is a humanity issue as we heard in the many statements that came before [the meeting],” said the measure’s prime sponsor, Councilwoman Olivia Bennett, D-Northview Heights, referring to several public comments submitted on the issue.&nbsp;“... I appreciate the confidence and the recognition that this is important work that needs to be done throughout the county.”</p>
<p>Members Anita Prizio, D-O’Hara, DeWitt Walton, D-Hill Distract, and Paul Klein, D-Shadyside, co-sponsored the measure.</p>
<p>While the motion passed 12-3, several members took issue with language in the bill.</p>
<p>“I do have a problem with the language. It seems that they’re calling out whites as a collective and claiming that whites are responsible for this ... racial classification scheme and things like that,” said Sam DeMarco, the Republican at-large member of council. “And I’m sorry, that language, I just can’t support it. To the folks on the right, we believe that white privilege is something that’s just something created by the left to try to create division.”</p>
<p>In other business, members referred to the Budget and Finance Committee County Executive Rich Fitzgerald’s bill on the reissuance of $172 million and refunding of $390 million in municipal bonds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Councilman Nick Futules, D-Oakmont, said he wants council to discuss the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including lost Allegheny Regional Asset District revenue and casino revenue.</p>
<p>“We haven’t talked about that much,” Mr. Futules said.&nbsp;“... I think we should focus at the council on what are we as this county going to do to help business people.”</p>
<p>No motions or bills to that effect were introduced.</p>
