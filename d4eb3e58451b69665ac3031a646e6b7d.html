<h1>Newish-looking but closed garage at Cal U finally to be repaired</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A five-level parking garage at California University of Pennsylvania —&nbsp;closed since partial collapse of what then was a 6-year-old structure back in 2016 — will be repaired now that Cal U and its contractor have settled a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Cal U officials are to receive nearly $4 million to cover repair costs and other expenses, including lost parking revenue since the 650-space Vulcan Garage was abruptly shut in August 2016 just as fall move-in was beginning that year, the school confirmed late Thursday.</p>
<p>A 20-foot-by-2-foot piece of concrete broke loose from the garage’s second level and hit the ground on Aug. 26, 2016, not far from pedestrians. No one was injured, and no cars were damaged, but officials including university police sealed off the garage and removed parked vehicles.</p>
<p>Surveillance video of the collapse <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2017/10/07/California-University-Parking-garage-collapse-debt/stories/201710060135" target="_blank">was obtained by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette </a>as part of a Right-to-Know Request and subsequent court fight to explore reasons behind the Vulcan Garage collapse. <br>The garage, in the heart of campus just behind the library, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2016/09/27/Cal-U-parking-garage-still-closed-after-concrete-falls/stories/201609270059" target="_blank">has remained closed for four years</a>&nbsp;— its entries blocked by barriers that became&nbsp;a conversation topic among some students and parents moving past the newish-looking but unused structure.</p>
<p>According to documents and emails obtained by the Post-Gazette at the time, the garage's floor framing consisted of precast concrete load-bearing structures called double-tees, each 12-feet wide, with extensions or "flanges" reinforced with carbon fiber mesh.</p>
<p>Outside engineer Wiss, Janney Elstner Associates summarized the suspected problem in a Sept. 13, 2016, email to Michael Kanalis, then-interim Cal U director of facilities, just after the firm was hired to investigate and analyze the failure.</p>
<p>"You [Mr. Kanalis] have reported that part of a double-tee flange on the second level failed and collapsed to the floor below," wrote Phillip Elgin, an engineer with the firm.</p>
<p>Officials from Manheim Corp. of Pittsburgh, the general contractor, could not be reached for comment late Thursday about the case and the settlement.</p>
<p>Campus officials said subsequent inspections found additional safety hazards in the nearly $13 million garage, part of a billion-dollar building boom the previous decade that reshaped the 14 state-owned universities including California and fueled enrollment growth.</p>
<p>Those investments, though, later <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2012/10/07/The-Other-College-Debt-Upgrades-put-Pennsylvania-schools-in-a-bind/stories/201210070238" target="_blank">added to debt worries across the State System of Higher Education </a>as enrollment peaked in 2010 at nearly 120,000 students&nbsp;<a href="/" target="_blank">and has steadily declined in the decade since</a>&nbsp;to about 96,000.</p>
<p>At Cal U, the lost garage revenue added to financial stress of a university whose enrollment has declined from 9,400 in 2010 to about 6,800 as of last fall.</p>
<p>In 2018, two years after the collapse, Cal U filed a lawsuit in Washington County Common Pleas Court against Manheim and its bond-holder, Travelers Casualty and Surety Co. of America.</p>
<p>Trustees at Cal U., meeting Wednesday evening, confirmed that the two-year lawsuit has been resolved.</p>
<p>“After a painstaking forensic investigation and a long and complex legal process, we have a solution that we believe is fair and equitable,” said Robert Thorn,&nbsp;vice president for&nbsp;administration and finance at Cal U.</p>
<p>If the planned repairs are sufficient, the facility could reopen in spring 2021, officials said.</p>
<p>Thursday’s statement from Cal U said that “a complete repair of the five-level parking structure will be funded entirely by the&nbsp;defendants, at an estimated cost of $2.4 million.”</p>
<p>It said that in addition, Cal U will receive about $1.35 million “as reimbursement for&nbsp;non-construction expenditures, such as legal fees, engineering costs and lost parking&nbsp;revenue, which the University estimated at $275,000 per year.”</p>
