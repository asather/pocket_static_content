<p>A school volunteer who helped distribute instructional items to 12th-graders at Pittsburgh Milliones 6-12 school earlier this month and fell ill has tested negative for the COVID-19 virus, Pittsburgh Public Schools officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The volunteer&nbsp;helped pass out laptops and instructional packets at the Hill District school on April 16, 20 and 21.</p>
<p>The district sent a message to families on Sunday that the volunteer would be tested after feeling sick.</p>
<p>The district said it shared the information “out of an abundance of caution.”</p>
<p>“As a reminder, the symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, cough and shortness of breath,” the district said. “If you or a member of your family experience any of the symptoms above, we encourage you to please follow-up with your primary care physician.”</p>
