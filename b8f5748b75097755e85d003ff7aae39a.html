<p>WASHINGTON — Providing medical supplies, N95 masks and testing equipment for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Delivering boxes of fresh food and dairy for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Providing hotel rooms and laundry for the Pennsylvania National Guard. Converting an acute care treatment area into an isolation ward. Providing highway alert signs, plastic dividers and technical services.</p>
<p>Federal contracts totaling at least $30 million were struck with companies in the Pittsburgh region during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a Post-Gazette analysis of federal contract data. At least 18 companies in the region signed deals related to COVID-19 with at least nine federal agencies, according to the data.</p>
<p>A fuller picture of COVID-19 contracting across the region came as watchdog groups just begin to assess the full extent of federal grants, loans and contracts flowing to local communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent weeks, online trackers have sprung up to show how trillions in federal money is being doled out to communities. The Project on Government Reform, a nonpartisan watchdog group based in Washington, collected and published the contracting data along with direct assistance, such as loans or grants, that can be filtered by ZIP code. (The Post-Gazette verified the data with official sources or companies.)</p>
<p>Sean Moulton, senior policy analyst for the group, said each tracker has limitations and is attempting to catch up with an unprecedented fire hose of government spending.&nbsp;But, if put together, the American public can get an accurate picture of where the money is going — and ultimately, spot any problems or inefficiencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our idea is to put this data in context to eventually answer the question of whether it was spent properly,” Mr. Moulton said. “It's a very complicated question to answer.”</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, a oversight panel of inspectors general established by Congress in March, has launched <a href="https://www.pandemicoversight.gov/track-the-money/funding-map" target="_blank">an interactive map</a>&nbsp;that can show funding by ZIP code, county and congressional district.&nbsp;The committee’s view, however, is incomplete: It tracks just $444 billion of the federal funds. (Mr. Moulton’s group has $1.5 trillion in its database.)</p>
<p>And the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s <a href="https://www.covidmoneytracker.org/" target="_blank">COVID Money Tracker</a>&nbsp;allows users to filter through recipients of federal dollars by industry and type of aid, but it does not drill down to local communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Never before have we thrown so much money in the economy so quickly,” Maya MacGuineas, president of the committee, which advocates for smaller budget deficits, said.</p>
<p>In the last five months, government spending, represented as a share of overall economic output, already has matched spending levels for the five years after the Great Recession, Ms. MacGuineas pointed out. Government debt is projected to eclipse the size of the U.S. economy next year.</p>
<p>Her group, she added, is not against spending what is necessary to help the country through the national crisis. But she will be watching the data to see whether the recessionary government spending complies with&nbsp;her “three T’s”: timely, temporary and targeted.</p>
<p><strong>Smaller contracts, major cancellations</strong></p>
<p>Outside of academic research, the Pittsburgh region is not known as a major federal contracting hub, dwarfed by cities with defense contractors and military bases.</p>
<p>But during a national health emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses struck deals to contribute what they could, the data showed.</p>
<p>For example, the USDA has doled out at least $14.5 million to local companies and nonprofits to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/food/2020/05/11/Farm-to-Table-Marburger-Monteverde-Paragon-Schneider-Turner-USDA-grant/stories/202005080086" target="_blank">distribute food from farms to people in need</a>.</p>
<p>Through the agency’s Farmers to Families Food Box program: Paragon Foods in Warrendale received $9 million, Schneider's Dairy got $3.8 million to deliver dairy products, Farm to Table Buy Local Corp. received&nbsp;$832,000, Marburger Farm Dairy in Evans City got $360,000, and Schneider’s Dairy in Pittsburgh got $315,000.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>The DoubleTree Pittsburgh received nearly $139,000 for housing members of the National Guard.</p>
<p>Government agencies also reached out for technical services, personal protective equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency reached a $2.4 million contract with Johnstown-based Concurrent Technologies Corp. to perform work on a data system used by the to electronically identify and verify federal employees and contractors at a given disaster zone.</p>
<p>The company, which has received $1.3 billion, mostly from the Defense Department, in federal contracts over the last decade,&nbsp;declined to comment.</p>
<p>Homeland Security also contracted with MSA Safety, a Cranberry-based producer of workplace safety products known for its pioneering firefighting equipment,&nbsp;for $1 million of respirators.</p>
<p>The region’s biggest deal, worth $10.2 million, went to TeleTracking Technologies, the Downtown-based firm tapped by the Health and Human Services to create real-time information with the&nbsp;number of available intensive care beds, ventilators, medical supplies and other COVID-19-related data from the nation’s 6,200 hospitals.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have questioned the tracking program over the past several weeks, including&nbsp;the burden of the new reporting requirements on hospitals and the transparency of the new data.&nbsp;After the company, citing a nondisclosure agreement with DHHS, refused to answer questions from Congress, three House Democrats <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2020/08/20/TeleTracking-Technologies-contract-hospitals-COVID-19-reporting-requirements-GAO/stories/202008190135" target="_blank">demanded a General Accountability Office investigation</a> into the contract.</p>
<p>Federal auditors plan to begin that investigation later this month, a GAO spokesman confirmed in an email last week.</p>
<p>The data suggested other problems that sunk some of the region’s biggest deals.</p>
<p>On April 20, the VA selected Bayhill Defense to provide N95 masks for $14.5 million.&nbsp;The company,&nbsp;founded in 2017 by Andrew Taglianetti, a 30-year-old former University of Pittsburgh football player, says it makes defense products like ammunition, assault rifles and grenade launchers.</p>
<p>Yet it had never received a federal contract before, and the VA contract was awarded without soliciting other bids. Bayhill Defense&nbsp;listed its business as a house in Larimer in federal contract data and a warehouse property in Moon as its “primary place of business,” according to its website.</p>
<p>The VA contract was canceled on May 7 before any money was exchanged, according to the data. It is unclear why the deal was struck and why it fell through. The company did not return requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contracts were a sliver of the direct aid delivered to the region. More than 10,000 businesses received Paycheck Protection Program loans <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/07/06/Congressman-Butler-Mike-Kelly-car-dealerships-receive-small-business-loans/stories/202007060082%20" target="_blank">totaling at least $1.1 billion,</a> according to the U.S. Small Business Administration. Governments, school districts and transit agencies received large grants.</p>
<p>As demand grows for <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/insight/2020/09/13/Bring-back-health-care-supply-chains-John-Joyce-David-Trone-China/stories/202009130001" target="_blank">domestically produced medical supplies</a>,&nbsp;money trackers will expand to monitor the patchwork of federal contracts.</p>
