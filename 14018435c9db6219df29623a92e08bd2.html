<h1>Canon-McMillan's Gerrit Nijenhuis highlights 2020 Pittsburgh Wrestling Classic rosters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gerrit Nijenhuis has marked off quite a few bucket list items during his senior year at Canon-McMillan High School.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;He became a four-time WPIAL Class 3A finalist and won his second title.</p>
<p>• He placed at the PIAA tournament for the fourth time and won his second title.</p>
<p>• He finished the season with an unblemished record of 47-0.</p>
<p>• He became the WPIAL’s all-time career wins leader with 181 wins.</p>
<p>Nijenhuis will mark off the final bucket list item of his high school career Saturday when he wrestles in the 46th Annual Pittsburgh Wrestling Classic at Pitt’s Fitzgerald Field House.</p>
<p>“I’ve been going to the classic since I was a kid,” said Nijenhuis, a Purdue recruit. “It’s always been a goal of mine to wrestle in the classic. There have been so many Canon-McMillan wrestlers who have been picked over the years. It’s an honor to follow in their footsteps.”</p>
<p>Nijenhuis will be the 46th Canon-McMillan wrestler to participate in the Pittsburgh Wrestling Classic, which was formerly known as the Dapper Dan Wrestling Classic, and the 17th Big Mac to appear in the feature match.</p>
<p>“Wrestling in the classic gives me an opportunity to face one of the top wrestlers in the country,” Nijenhuis said. “I’m really looking forward to the opportunity.”</p>
<p>Nijenhuis (181-16) will face John Poznaski (155-12), a New Jersey state champ and Rutgers recruit from Colonia High School, in the 182-pound match.</p>
<p>The feature match has a significant change to its lineup as the weight classes at 113 and 285 pounds have been replaced by an additional match at 138 and 195.</p>
<p>“A lack of top-tier high school seniors in Pennsylvania and/or United States in certain weight classes and an overabundance in other weight classes is the primary factor that drove this difficult decision,” said Kraig Nellis, co-chairman of the selection committee. “The emphasis on showcasing the best wrestlers in the state and country was a critical factor in our decision.”</p>
<p>Nijenhuis is one of four WPIAL wrestlers on the Pennsylvania All-Star Team. The others are Norwin’s Kurtis Phipps, North Hills’ Sam Hillegas and Mt. Lebanon’s Luke Stout.</p>
<p>Phipps (153-10), a Bucknell recruit, is a four-time WPIAL Class 3A champion, three-time PIAA finalist and one-time state champ. His opponent in the 126-pound bout is Virginia Tech recruit Eddie Ventresca (156-17), a New Jersey state champion from Pope John Paul XXIII.</p>
<p>Hillegas (157-5), a Virginia Tech recruit, is a three-time WPIAL Class 3A champion, three-time PIAA finalist and two-time champ. His opponent in one of the two matches at 138 pounds is Northern Iowa recruit Cael Happel (217-5), a four-time Iowa state champ from Lisbon High School.</p>
<p>Stout (153-16), a Princeton recruit, won Class 3A WPIAL and PIAA titles this year after placing second in both tournaments last year. His opponent in the 195-pound bout is Iowa University recruit Gabe Christenson (156-23), a two-time Iowa state champion from Southest Polk High School.</p>
<p>The feature match between the Pennsylvania All-Stars and United States All-Stars is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. The preliminary match between the WPIAL All-Stars and Maryland All-Stars will begin at 4 p.m.</p>
