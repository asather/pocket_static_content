<h1>COVID concerns prompt changes to trout seasons, stockings and licensing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With all that fresh air and open space you might think fishing is immune to COVID-19.</p>
<p>But last week the state Fish and Boat Commission announced changes to the 2020 trout season intended to “protect the safety of the public and staff, while preserving the opportunity to enjoy the fun and recreational health benefits of fishing.”</p>
<p>As expected 3.2 million hatchery trout will be stocked this year, plus another million raised in a network of cooperative nurseries. But trout seasons have been consolidated, stocking schedules scrubbed and the annual opportunity to assist in trout stocking has been rescinded. Additional changes will impact the ways fishing and boating licenses and permits are purchased, and revise license verification methods on the water.</p>
<p>“While our calendars may start to look a little different, one thing we can count on is that there will be a trout season and there will still be plenty of fish out there to enjoy,” said Tim Schaeffer, Fish and Boat executive director in a statement.</p>
<p>The most noticeable changes will be the elimination of the regional youth fishing day and regional season opener in 18 southeastern counties. Instead, a single statewide Mentored Youth Trout Day will be held April 11, and fishing on approved trout waters will open across the state at 8 a.m. April 18.</p>
<p>The Fish and Boat memorandum stated that the changes were made under direction provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Pennsylvania Department of Health with the goal of reducing large gatherings and a migration of anglers traveling into the state’s southeastern corner, an area already heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Trout stocking schedules posted in detail on an interactive page at fishandboat.com? Forget them. A message posted in that space states: “This page has been temporarily suspended from updates due to the accelerated stocking schedule in place to ensure as many fish are stocked as possible while taking measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19.”</p>
<p>The message reminds anglers that volunteers will not be permitted to assist with stocking.</p>
<p>Since last week tanker trucks have not adhered to previously released schedules. In many cases stocking dates that were originally spread over late winter and spring are being consolidated into big frothy drops at individual lakes and streams. Stockings are being prioritized to put fish in parts of the state expected to be most heavily impacted by COVID-19, where vehicle traffic, including stocking trucks, could be restricted.</p>
<p>Rick Kauffman, Fish and Boat Commissioner from Berks County, said in the statement that health concerns forced the abrupt change in trout-stocking schedules and tactics.</p>
<p>“This change in our stocking approach is necessary to fulfill a critical mission of our agency and our obligation to anglers,” he said. “We’re trying to get as many fish in the water as possible as quickly as possible while we still have the best access to waterways and available staff. While our methods may be different this season, people will have the same opportunity to get outdoors and fish, which has proven benefits to our physical and mental health.”</p>
<p>The impact on the fish will likely be negligible. Hatchery trout are stocked on a put-and-take basis and are not intended to live longer than a few months before they are harvested. Anglers who happen to be on some special-regulation waters when the pre-season stocking trucks arrive, however, could have unintended catch-and-release access to many hundreds of trout. There will be no in-season replenishment stockings. It was not clear whether the plan will include extended-season fall stockings.</p>
<p>In an attempt to reduce airborne exposure to COVID-19 while standing in line for a fishing license, launch permit or boat registration renewal, anglers and boaters are encouraged to purchase online via the FishBoatPA app or The Outdoor Shop (www.pa.wildlifelicense.com). Instead of possessing a paper fishing license, a .pdf file can be provided through email. Boating customers can get a digital receipt that serves as a temporary permit or registration valid for immediate use. Hull decals and registration cards would be delivered by postal mail in several weeks.</p>
<p>“If approached by a Waterways Conservation Officer in the field, the angler or boater would only have to produce the digital image of the license, permit or registration on their phone or mobile device,” stated the instruction from Fish and Boat. “A digital copy of the .pdf, photo or screenshot of your fishing license, launch permit or boat registration on your phone or mobile device will all be accepted as proof of possession.”</p>
