<h1>Australia halts Hong Kong extradition agreement, expands visa program</h1>

<p>HONG KONG — Australia will suspend its extradition agreement with Hong Kong because of the new national security law imposed by China and extend temporary visas for Hong Kongers in the country, Prime Minister said Thursday.</p>
<p>The announcement, which came on the heels of Canada’s suspension of its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and Britain’s statement that it was considering a similar move because of the punitive law, threatened to deepen the diplomatic tensions between Canberra and Beijing.</p>
<p>Mr. Morrison said Australia’s visa extension for people from Hong Kong who are already in the country, which would allow them to stay for an additional five years, would also open a path to permanent residency for them. He also suggested businesses should move from Hong Kong to his country, declaring, “We are a great immigration nation.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, Australia also warned its citizens not to travel to Hong Kong, citing questions about the interpretation of the security law and the risk of Australians being sent to mainland China for prosecution.</p>
<p>“You may be at increased risk of detention on vaguely defined national security grounds,” Australia’s travel advice states. “You could break the law without intending to.”</p>
<p>The announcements were the latest in a series of moves by countries in response to a law that has drastically increased the role of Beijing’s security services in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous former British colony that returned to China in 1997. It raised fears that Beijing would curb free speech, the ability to assemble and other rights that have traditionally been better protected in Hong Kong than in mainland China.</p>
<p>Mr. Morrison said Australia’s decisions were in response to the potentially sweeping effects of the new security law imposed on Hong Kong.</p>
<p>“Our government, together with other governments around the world, have been very consistent in expressing our concerns about the imposition of the national security law on Hong Kong,” Mr. Morrison said. “Today we have agreed to announce that that national security law constitutes a fundamental change of circumstances in respect to our extradition agreement with Hong Kong.”</p>
<p>He said that the government was not expecting large numbers of new applications from Hong Kong and that the application and approval processes would remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Australia’s move is not as sweeping as Britain’s decision to open a path to citizenship for as many as 3 million Hong Kongers.</p>
<p>In an editorial Wednesday, The Global Times, which is owned by the Communist Party of China, warned that the Australian economy would have a “bitter pill to swallow” if Canberra gave Hong Kong citizens a “safe haven.”</p>
