<p>ROCHESTER, N.Y. — The death of Daniel Prude after a confrontation with police sparked a third night of demonstrations in New York’s third-largest city, with protesters demanding more accountability for how it happened and legislation to change how authorities respond to mental health emergencies.</p>
<p>Advocates for such legislation say Prude’s death and the actions of seven now-suspended Rochester police officers — including one who covered the Black man’s head with a “spit hood” during the March encounter — demonstrate how police are ill-equipped to deal with people suffering mental problems.</p>
<p>Having police respond can be a “recipe for disaster,” The National Alliance on Mental Illness said in a statement Friday.</p>
<p>Prude’s death “is yet another harrowing tragedy, but a story not unfamiliar to us,” the advocacy group said. “People in crisis deserve help, not handcuffs.”</p>
<p>Stanley Martin, an organizer of Free the People Rochester, told reporters: “We do not need violent workers with guns to respond to mental health crises.”</p>
<p>Activists have marched nightly in the city of 210,000 on Lake Ontario since police body camera videos of the encounter with Prude were released this week by his family.</p>
<p>Friday night’s protest resulted in 11 arrests, police said. As they had the night before, officers doused activists at police headquarters with a chemical spray to drive them from barricades around the building.</p>
<p>As the night wore on, demonstrators were pushed further back, as police fired what appeared to be pepper balls. Fireworks were shot off and a bus stop was set on fire.</p>
<p>Prude’s family has said he appeared to be spiraling into crisis in the hours before police handcuffed him on a street and pinned the naked man face down. In the video, police are also seen covering his head with the white “spit hood,” designed to protect police from bodily fluids.</p>
<p>“You’re trying to kill me!” the 41-year-old man is heard saying. He died days later in what the medical examiner ruled was a homicide.</p>
<p>A police union has defended the officers involved in the encounter, saying they were strictly following department training and protocols, including using the mesh hood.</p>
