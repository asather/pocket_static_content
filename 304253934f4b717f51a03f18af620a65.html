<p>The death of a woman who was fatally beaten last fall during a home invasion in Penn Hills has been ruled a homicide.</p>
<p>Tiffany Williams, 46, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/11/03/Woman-injured-Penn-Hills-home-invasion-dies-Cimarron-Drive/stories/201911030207?cid=search" target="_blank">died Nov. 2</a> from bilateral pulmonary emboli, or blood clots affecting the lungs, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office said Monday.</p>
<p>On the night of Oct. 30, two men wearing ski masks entered Ms. Williams’ home in the 900 block of Cimarron Drive in search of money, police said.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported seeing two men arguing at or near the residence and hearing gunshots. Police found a badly beaten Ms. Williams who was taken to Forbes Regional Hospital in Monroeville where she died three days later.</p>
<p>At the time, Penn Hills police chief Howard Burton <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/11/04/Penn-Hills-home-invasion-likely-not-random-chief-says/stories/201911040109" target="_blank">said he did not believe the attack was random</a>.</p>
