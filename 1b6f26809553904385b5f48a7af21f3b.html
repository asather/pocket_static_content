<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police are looking for a person who decapitated a dog and left its head in the owner’s backyard on Sunday.</p>
<p>Barbara Greaves, of East Palestine, Ohio, just over the Beaver County line, alerted police on Friday night that her beagle named Trouble had gone missing after she let the dog out on a “cable run” in her backyard in the 100 block of East North Avenue, according to local police.</p>
<p>By Sunday afternoon her son, Scott Greaves, found the dog deceased in the family’s backyard with its head detached from its body.</p>
<p>Investigators are asking anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity Friday night or Sunday to call police at 330-426-4341.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the family has started a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/justicefortroubleinep/posts/?ref=page_internal" target="_blank">Justice for Trouble Facebook page</a> with the hopes of finding whoever’s responsible for her death and to accept donations for a reward for any information leading to the arrest of a suspect.</p>
