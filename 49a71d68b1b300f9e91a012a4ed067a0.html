<h1>Protesters — some armed — brave rain to send message to Mich. leaders as virus debate rages</h1>

<p>LANSING, Mich. -- They cheered. They booed. They honked their horns and waved flags. They stood in the rain and cold to send a message to Michigan leaders.</p>
<p>Protesters packed the lawn and sidewalks outside the Michigan Capitol on Thursday, many standing elbow to elbow as they expressed outrage over Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-home order, pressuring lawmakers to vote against extending the state of emergency declaration that the governor issued at the onset of the coronavirus outbreak</p>
<p>Dubbed the "American Patriot Rally," Thursday's demonstration brought together members of conservative groups, militias, proponents of open carry of firearms, people protesting abortion rights, and anti-vaccination protesters, plus many Michiganders who said they were not associated with any group but believe the stay-at-home order goes too far.</p>

<p>The state of emergency, which expires at midnight, was the subject of debate inside the state House and Senate chambers Thursday as lawmakers considered granting a 28-day extension of the order requested by Whitmer.&nbsp;The Republican-led state ultimately refused Thursday to extend the state’s coronavirus emergency declaration and voted to authorize a lawsuit challenging Whitmer’s authority and actions to combat the pandemic.</p>
<p>The governor, unfazed, responded with orders stating under one law that an emergency still exists, while under another law declaring new 28-day states of emergency and disaster. The latter measure will ensure health care workers continue to have special legal protections, she said.</p>
<p>Whitmer accused GOP lawmakers of “putting their heads in the sand and putting more lives and livelihoods at risk. I’m not going to let that happen.”</p>
<p>For their part, those who gathered on the Capitol Lawn to voice concerns and displeasure with the governor’s restrictions on business and recreational activity endured heavy bouts of rain to listen to speakers and protest the stay-home order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s great that people feel strongly and get the opportunity to express how they feel about the politics of the situation,” said protester Mark Young, of Northville.</p>
<p>Young said he’s not been to a protest in nearly 40 years, but the current atmosphere made him feel like he needed to be part of the movement Thursday. He hoped gathering would send a message to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle that people want to get back to work, and they want to keep one another safe.</p>
<p>"There’s a happy medium ground here, and it would be great if people could keep cool, keep calm and reach out to find that middle ground,” Young said.</p>
<p>While he agreed Whitmer’s the initial order signed in mid-March, Young says it’s been in place long enough and it’s now time to start reopening businesses, especially as more data becoming available on how COVID-19 is spreading in Michigan.</p>
<p>“It seems she feels most safe keeping everything locked down. But I think a lot of information has been published that indicates that’s not necessarily the best and only way to protect society,” Young said. “I believe that if we take proper precautions and protect the most vulnerable people, that it’s possible for people to go back to work.”</p>
<p>For Tim Rugg of Highland Township, he said days like Thursday are important because citizens have a duty to inform their political leaders how they feel on government issues.</p>
<p>“If we all could be educated well enough to not mince our words, we together could hold our government more accountable than what we have been,” Rugg said.</p>
<p>He believes Whitmer has steamrolled those who disagree with her and hasn’t listened to the people of Michigan. However, Rugg also said some blame should be directed at Republican leadership that has yet to reign in the governor’s powers.</p>
<p>“The House and the Senate are run by the Republicans. Well, when you have that big majority, what’s the problem? Get your act together, do your job, knock it off. You work for us,” Rugg said.</p>
<p>Protesters began gathering in numbers around 8 a.m. Speakers began taking the stage about 9:45 a.m.</p>
<p>Jason Howland, one of the organizers of the protest, applauded those who showed up and said they made a difference by exercising their freedom of speech.</p>
<p>“This is a victory today. We’ve won. We’ve shown them they can’t keep us in our homes,” Howland said.</p>
<p>Along with the several hundred people on the grounds outside the Capitol, dozens of cars drove up and down the surrounding streets honking their horns and shouting encouragement to protesters. They did not significantly slow down traffic as was the case two weeks ago at the “Operation Gridlock” protest, but their horns could be heard continuously throughout Thursday’s rally.</p>
<p>Members of the Michigan Liberty Militia patrolled the grounds, armed with guns after being hired as “security detail” by the organizers. One of the members of the militia, Phil Robinson of Barry County, said the group brought nine people to serve on the detail.</p>
<p>“We are strictly here running security, making sure everybody has a right to peacefully assemble,” Robinson said. “That is our only mission here today we are not here as protesters or rally goers were strictly here, exercising our Second Amendment right and to make sure that everybody has a right to peacefully assemble.”</p>
<p>Robinson said he was surprised at how laid back and easy going the crowd was early on in the protest.</p>
<p>“This seems a little more mellow than I anticipated, especially with what happened yesterday,” Robinson said. “I was expecting more people to be a little more, I guess amped up, which is not the case .Which is a good thing because nobody wants trouble,” Robinson said.</p>
<p>Robinson was referring to an incident in the gallery of the House Wednesday in which a handful of protesters were physically escorted out of the gallery.</p>
<p>Shortly after the speakers finished up, protesters piled into the Capitol building causing a backup in the lobby as people stood shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow attendees in clear violation of state social distancing guidelines. Those inside shouted to be allowed into the House chambers, where lawmakers were meeting at the time, but were denied access.</p>
<p>“Other than chanting loudly, it’s been very calm,” said Michigan State Police Lt. Brian Oleksyk.</p>
<p>To abide with executive orders, only 275 people are allowed inside the Capitol building at a time, Oleksyk said, and once that numbers was hit, officers enforced the rule and would not allow anyone in until more people left the building.</p>
<p>One arrest had been made as of 2 p.m. after one protester assaulted another protester, Oleksyk said.</p>
