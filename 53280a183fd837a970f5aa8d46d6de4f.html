<h1>Steelers' Steven Nelson using platform to 'create change' as best as he can</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Quiet and unassuming would be a perfectly accurate description of Steven Nelson during his first season with the Steelers. He carried that persona in the locker room after signing a rich free-agent contract last year, and he portrayed the same image on the field.</p>
<p>That’s about to change as Nelson enters his second season in Pittsburgh. Talking a little more on the field might help the Steelers defense get better, and talking off the field in the wake of George Floyd’s death and the protests that have gripped the country is something he believes is important, too.</p>
<p>Nelson, a 5-foot-11, 194-pound cornerback, did his job exceedingly well last season. Pro Football Focus ranked him among the NFL’s top corners in 2019, but when it came time to hand out the traditional postseason accolades, Nelson was nowhere to be found. He didn’t make All-Pro or get voted into the Pro Bowl.</p>
<p>The main reason, Nelson believes, was his paltry interception total. While Joe Haden, his counterpart on the other side of the defense, made the Pro Bowl with five interceptions, Nelson managed just one.</p>
<p>“The interceptions and big plays, I was lacking in that area,” Nelson said Thursday. “It’s hard to go out there and say, ‘I’m going to get some interceptions.’ You have to get some targets. I’ve had some conversations with my inner circle. Maybe I have to do some talking this year and get guys to throw at me this year. Whatever it takes.”</p>
<p>After being one of the most-targeted corners in the NFL during his final season with the Chiefs, Nelson couldn’t get quarterbacks to throw his way last season. They went at Haden much more often.</p>
<p>Haden gave up 42 receptions on 79 targets while Nelson gave up 34 receptions on just 66 targets.</p>
<p>Having two lockdown corners is one of the reasons the Steelers defense finished the season among the best in the league in almost every statistical category.</p>
<p>“Joe is my guy,” Nelson said. “We’re like Batman and Robin. Ever since I got to Pittsburgh, he’s been a genuine guy on and off the field. We bounce things off each other. We’re highly competitive guys, and we feed off each other. If he makes a big play, I feel like I have to make a big play. We pair together very well.”</p>
<p>Nelson also wants to use his voice more off the field this year. Cities across the country, including Pittsburgh, continue to have demonstrations in the streets following Floyd’s killing at the hands of four Minneapolis police officers last week.</p>
<p>Nelson and Haden have been two of the more active Steelers players on social media as they try to shine a light on police brutality and social injustice, and he doesn’t plan to stop making his opinions heard.</p>
<p>Nelson believes it’s important to start a dialogue that will help the country heal.</p>
<p>“That’s the good thing about being a professional athlete,” he said. “We have big platforms to speak out for the people, voice our opinion and thoughts, and just try to create change as best we can. A lot of guys have big followings on social media. That’s a great start to try and spread positivity and love throughout our country because God knows we all need it right now.”</p>
<p>Nelson conducted his Zoom interview with the media one day after Saints quarterback Drew Brees was criticized by players across the league, including his own teammates, for his remarks about national anthem protests.</p>
<p>Brees told Yahoo Finance that he will “never agree with anyone disrespecting the flag,” when asked about the potential of players kneeling for the anthem once the 2020 season begins. Brees apologized for his comments Thursday morning, but the backlash could be felt for some time among his NFL brethren.</p>
<p>“It was rough, man, to see that from a guy like that because he’s very well-respected throughout our league,” Nelson said. “A lot of guys look up to him. His comment was very insensitive to the whole situation. That rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. I’m glad he apologized for it. I don’t really hold grudges. I can’t speak for anyone else. It’s going to be hard to come back from that with everything that’s going on right now.”</p>
<p>The Steelers have continued Zoom meetings with teammates and coaches this week while other teams have backed off those meetings during the protests. Nelson said the issue of kneeling or other signs of solidarity have not been specifically discussed, but he said his expectations are to bring positive change in a time when there is so much negativity.</p>
<p>“I do think things always have to get worse before they get better,” he said. “If this is what it takes, if people have to protest or riot or loot, just to send a message; that’s just is what it is. I’m all for positivity and trying to do things the right way. This isn’t just in America. You see protesters all over the world. This is a big deal. If this doesn’t change all of it, this can change a lot of it. And I think that’s good.”</p>
