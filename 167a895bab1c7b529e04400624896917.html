<h1>Paul Zeise: Herb Douglas is a Pitt treasure, and Tuesday was a special day for him</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Herb Douglas has made a life out of beating the odds, fighting for what he believes in and being persistent. He has been a trail blazer and he has proven that a belief in oneself will pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>And his smile from ear to ear on Tuesday as he sat and listened to Pitt chancellor Patrick Gallagher and athletic director Heather Lyke unveil their plans for an initiative called “<a href="https://pittsburghpanthers.com/news/2020/1/14/general-pitt-unveils-plans-for-victory-heights-initiative-to-support-student-athletes-and-marching-band.aspx" target="_blank">Victory Heights</a>” was absolutely priceless, especially to those of us who know his story.</p>
<p>The project is a major upgrade and addition of facilities for Pitt’s Olympic and non-revenue sports. There will be a 3,500-seat arena for volleyball, wrestling and gymnastics, new practice facilities, a new band facility and an athletic performance center.</p>
<p>And, of course, near and dear to Douglas’s heart is a new 300-meter&nbsp;indoor track and training facility. The Panthers have been without a track since 1999 when Pitt Stadium was demolished.</p>
<p>Douglas, now 97, won the bronze medal in the long jump at the 1948 Olympics and is one of the Panthers’ greatest athletes of all time. And that’s why his voice was one of the loudest in support of this project. And it was a push he wasn’t going to quit until he finally got to see a plan put in place.</p>
<p>Lyke and Gallagher joked about Douglas’ persistence, and both acknowledged how influential he has been on the university and what a role model he has been for young athletes everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Herb reminded us of the lessons his father taught him,” Gallagher said in his opening remarks.&nbsp;“Four simple principles: analyze, organize, initiate and follow through. And so, Herb, I want to thank you for keeping us on track and I want to thank you for joining us today as we move beyond analyzing and get to initiate and follow through.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Douglas is an amazing man who has lived an amazing life, and he certainly doesn’t look like he is closing in on 100. He joked that even at his advanced age, he could still beat Sam Clancy in a race, and I believe him because he has continued to keep in shape regardless of how old he has gotten.</p>
<p>“About two months ago I had to take a break,” Douglas said.&nbsp;“My doctor told me I need a [heart] valve replaced, so I had to stop [swimming], but I’ll be back out there once I’m allowed.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Douglas was born and raised in a different time, when African-Americans were treated like second-class citizens and black athletes were still mostly relegated to their own leagues and not permitted to compete against white athletes in some places. He said he knows all of those struggles were worth it because they opened doors to unlimited opportunities for black athletes.</p>
<p>His father taught him many lessons, but one of them was how to be independent. His father went blind when Douglas was only 5 years old and was one of the first African-Americans to use a blind service dog. Douglas won an Olympic bronze medal but wasn’t able to get the job as Pitt’s track coach. Yet he continued his education and eventually ended up with a successful career as an executive in the beverage industry.</p>
<p>Despite all of his travels and life experiences, Douglas has always had Pitt close to his heart and he has always been a major supporter of the university and its athletic department. He has always loved Pitt, and Pittsburgh is his home. He has been persistent in pushing for a track and field facility for over the 60 years and that’s why Tuesday’s announcement was so special for him.</p>
<p>“We used to run on the cinder track,” Douglas said.&nbsp;“My ultimate aim was to help this entire region develop track and field. And here I am, sitting here almost 98, who else would be crazy enough to still be involved in this kind of activities? But God gives me the strength to keep moving on. And from the time I first met [Gallagher], he knew I wanted a track. And I can see this Tri-State area in a decade or so will have a lot of Olympians and that is what would please me more.”</p>
<p>Alonzo Webb, who has been Pitt’s track coach for almost two decades, understands the importance of Douglas’s story as well as how much he has meant as a supporter of the track program. Webb said he was delighted to find out that Douglas would be able to attend Tuesday and is just hoping that he is still around in 2024 when the facility opens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"He's a great friend and mentor to me for the past 20 years. A month doesn't go past that he doesn't call me or I don't call him, just to check in and see how things are going,” Webb said. “Every single conversation comes up with the track. We talk about the track every single time.</p>
<p>“He's been so passionate about, 'Hey coach, you guys need a track. We're going to get you one.' I'm so happy."</p>
<p>I’m happy for Douglas, too, as he is an inspiration and role model and has waited for this moment his entire life. And like Webb, I’m hoping he is still around to see the facility’s grand opening. Given his life and what he’s accomplished, I’m not going to bet against him.</p>
