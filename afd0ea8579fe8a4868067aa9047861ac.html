<h1>Trump supporters announce two events in the Pittsburgh area next week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A pair of events in the Pittsburgh area this week —&nbsp;one affiliated with Donald Trump’s re-election campaign and one in support of it —&nbsp;will feature a wide range of the president’s most outspoken supporters, some of whom have built prominent followings themselves around unabashedly provocative commentary.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, members of the Trump campaign’s official ‘Women for Trump’ coalition, one of its many coalitions aimed at organizing different demographics around the president’s 2020 bid, will visit Cranberry to hold a panel discussion.</p>
<p>The group is stopping there on a three-day bus tour through Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, and feature appearances from senior campaign adviser Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, as well as adviser Mercedes Schlapp, press secretary and former GOP spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany and the duet of Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson —&nbsp;otherwise known as the Fox Nation commentators Diamond and Silk.</p>
<p>After their appearance in Cranberry, the women will head to York, Pa., to conclude the bus tour with one final event.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a group unaffiliated with the president’s campaign, Pennsylvania Women for Trump, will hold a gala in the North Side with conservative commentators and activists.</p>
<p>It will be headlined by radio host and former White House official Sebastian Gorka —&nbsp;who promised, in a Facebook video, the event would be the “party of a lifetime.” Other guests include commentators Alfonzo Rachel, Lucretia Hughes and Katie Hopkins, activist Scott Presler and Virginia organizer Alice Butler-Short.</p>
<p>Ticket packages for the gala range from a solo $100 general admission ticket to $2,500 VIP tables. It is unclear what the proceeds will benefit.</p>
<p>The event’s organizer could not be reached for comment. The organization of Pennsylvania women describes itself as a “Judeo-Christian Faith-based group of Patriots formed to support our President, our God, our country and our conservative values.”</p>
