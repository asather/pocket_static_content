<h1>Justin Schultz return brings the Penguins blue line one step closer to full strength</h1>

<p>First shift. First shot.</p>
<p>That’s how fast the scoring chance happened for Penguins defenseman Justin Schultz. Almost immediately after the defenseman hopped over the boards for his first shift since a Dec. 7 lower-body injury, Sidney Crosby found him streaking down the middle of the ice.</p>
<p>But, this is no Mario Lemieux story. The shot was snared out by the gloved hand of Philadelphia Flyer goalie Brian Elliott, robbing what would have been the perfect welcome-back moment for Schultz.</p>
<p>“I literally stepped onto the ice and got that chance,” Schultz said. “That was nice. I wish I would have buried it, but it was nice to get a chance there.”</p>
<p>It turned out the Penguins didn’t need the extra tally after all, as Crosby eventually lifted the Penguins past their in-state rival, 4-3, in overtime. But that scoring chance flashed just a little bit of what the Penguins have been missing with Schultz sidelined.</p>
<p>The Penguins trust his offensive instincts enough that they initially envisioned Schultz could be on the top power play, along with Kris Letang, during training camp. As the season evolves and Schultz reintegrates himself into the team, it will be interesting to see if the Penguins try that look again to create more offensive opportunities for Schultz.</p>
<p>Schultz said he felt just a little rusty on the ice. But all in all, solid for a first game back.</p>
<p>“It’s never an easy thing when you miss the amount of time that he’s missed and then you jump right into a game like that,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “It was pretty intense. But I thought he did a real good job. He gets a Grade-A scoring chance on his very first shift. It would have been terrific if he scored. But he makes a hell of a shot.”</p>
<p>During an injury-plague season, the forwards were hit hardest initially, to the point that defenseman Juuso Riikola had to play wing for a handful of games. Then, that injury bug migrated to the blue line, where Schultz, Brian Dumoulin and Kris Letang have all endured stints on the injured reserve.</p>
<p>With Schultz finally back, the Penguins are beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel on defense – and possibly what the defensive corps could look like if everyone can get healthy at the same time.</p>
<p>Currently, Dumoulin remains the lone blueliner still injured, as he works his way back from ankle surgery. When he returns, Dumoulin will likely step back in to play next to Letang on the top pair. That will leave the Penguins with a decision. They can either reunite Marcus Pettersson and Schultz, as they did for a significant chunk of the season when both were healthy. Or, with as well as Pettersson and rookie John Marino have played together, the Penguins could opt to play Jack Johnson with Schultz, something the pair did a decent amount last season.</p>
<p>But that may be looking too far ahead.</p>
<p>For now, the Penguins will have to do some juggling to get their best six healthy defensemen on the ice together at the same time. On Friday night, that meant playing Chad Ruhwedel on his unnatural left side next to Schultz on the third pairing.</p>
<p>“It’s not ideal,” Sullivan said of playing Ruhwedel on the left. “It’s not what we would prefer. But there’s no perfect scenario right now based on where we’re at.</p>
<p>“I thought Chad did a pretty good job on that left side. It’s not easy to play the off side, especially when you’re not used to it. One of the things we love about Chad is whatever we ask of him, he accepts it and just goes about his business.”</p>
<p>If the Penguins choose to go away from the look with Ruhwedel playing his off side, there are a couple options. The simplest would be to play Riikola on his natural left side instead of Ruhwedel. However, the Penguins have showed on several instances that they’d rather play two same-handed defenseman together rather than play Riikola.</p>
<p>Another option would be to play Marino and Letang together, as they initially did when Dumoulin got hurt. That look had its issues. But it’s an option that would allow the Penguins to still keep the same six healthy players on the ice, with Schultz and Pettersson together and then playing Johnson with Ruhwedel.</p>
<p>Those decisions will surely be sorted out over the coming games as the Penguins reincorporate Schultz into the lineup. But for now, they’re just glad to have some more options with one of their top-four defensemen back – and creating scoring chances.</p>
