<h1>Sidney Crosby skates individually prior to Penguins practice Wednesday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sidney Crosby worked out on the ice individually prior to Wednesday’s full-team practice.</p>
<p>The Penguins captain was the only skater on the ice when the doors were opened to the media at 10 a.m. He scooped up some pucks into a bag, sat on the bench while the Zambonis drove around and then took his sticks back to the dressing room.</p>
<p>Crosby has not participated in a full team event since leaving Saturday’s scrimmage in the second period. No one play stuck out for a reason why he may have left the ice. He did not appear in serious pain, taking time to stop and collect his extra sticks before heading to the dressing room.</p>
<p>In an attempt to maintain medical privacy amidst COVID-19, the NHL has implemented a new policy in which it will not disclose any information about injuries or illnesses. Coach Mike Sullivan and general manager Jim Rutherford both cited that policy in the days after Crosby’s absence.</p>
<p>Crosby did not participate in the Penguins’ practice on Sunday, nor was he on the ice for the intrasquad scrimmage on Monday. After Tuesday’s off day, he was back on the ice, but only for individual work.</p>
<p>The Penguins are scheduled to play another intrasquad scrimmage on Thursday night. They practice Friday and have one final scrimmage on Saturday before departing for Toronto on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Penguins will begin their postseason journey on Aug. 1 in Toronto against the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<p>Additionally, Patric Hornqvist and Juuso Riikola returned to a full-team practice after skating in a separate group during Monday's scrimmage. They were two of the nine Penguins who were held out last week as a precaution due to a possible secondary exposure to COVID-19. The other seven did not participate in the full-team practice.</p>
<p>Hornqvist skated on the right wing of the third line, along with center Jared McCann and left wing Patrick Marleau. Hornqvist also took reps with the top power play unit, playing his familiar role as a net-front presence. Riikola was paired with Chad Ruhwedel as two extra depth defensemen.</p>
