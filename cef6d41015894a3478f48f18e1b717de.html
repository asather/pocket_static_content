<h1>Road closure at Highland Park is limiting parking and may be keeping visitors away</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After an announcement this month from the city that Reservoir Drive in Highland Park would be closed to vehicle traffic, many locals and frequent park visitors voiced their complaints.</p>
<p>The city made the announcement on June 10 that the loop would be closed to all non-emergency vehicles beginning the next day.&nbsp;The decision was intended to give more space to people using the park. With construction also limiting open areas of the park, congestion was becoming an issue when social distancing was a bigger priority.</p>
<p>But it appears that the new restriction — and resulting parking limitations —&nbsp;had an unintended consequence.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen less people up here now than I’ve ever seen before,” said&nbsp;Domenic Marasco, 74, a Morningside resident who frequently visits Highland Park.&nbsp;“They’re shying away because there’s nowhere to park. All we want is access to the park — the whole park.”</p>
<p>Mr. Marasco and a group of his friends meet at the park every day. They used to drive around to the back of the reservoir where they had a favorite bench.</p>
<p>“Now, we’ve relocated up front, here,” Mr. Marasco said.</p>
<p>The group noted that their age makes it difficult for them to walk all the way to their old spot. The loop around the reservoir is a slightly more than a mile long, which means it’s just over a half-mile to get to the back end.</p>
<p>Karina Ricks, director of the city’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, said at a June meeting for the Highland Park Community Council that “the origins of this project are a bit obscure,” but were based on positive feedback they had received from a pilot initiative that was done in May.</p>
<p>Mr. Marasco said he has been in contact with multiple community leaders and submitted a petition with 160 signatures to Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Deb Gross’ office.</p>
<p>“They just took this whole park, and no one had any say,” he said.</p>
<p>With the closure of Reservoir Drive, parking has become limited. Prior to the closure, vehicles could park anywhere along the one-way loop. Since then,&nbsp;visitors are being encouraged to park on Highland Avenue, a residential street that requires an uphill walk to the main park entrance.</p>
<p>Residents living on Highland Avenue, some of whom don’t have driveways and rely on street parking, have had more difficulty finding a spot, Mr. Marasco said.</p>
<p>Handicap parking also has been limited to one lot, accessible by Farmhouse Drive and located in an area that makes many of the park’s amenities inaccessible.</p>
<p>One resident, Tina Calabro, is planning to file a grievance with the city’s Americans with Disabilities Act compliance office, as the government has provided no timeline for when it will make adjustments, she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Ricks said that when the project was originally put into place, it was intended to be a summer-long implementation. Now, they are “at a really critical juncture” on whether to continue with the closure.</p>
