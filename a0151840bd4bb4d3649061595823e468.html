<p>In case you somehow haven’t heard by now, the cinematic version of “Hamilton” will be available for home viewing on July 3, and now we have a first glimpse into what the stage hit will look like onscreen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disney+ on Monday released the first trailer for Lin-Manuel Miranda’s award-winning Broadway hit, which was adapted specifically for the screen and set for a big-screen release next year — until the COVID-19 lockdown.</p>
<p>The streaming service Disney+ made a surprise announcement in May that the show would instead be available on the small screen. The Walt Disney Co. had paid $75 million for the show’s cinematic release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week, big chain movie theaters such as Cinemark and AMC announced that they will reopen this month with coronavirus safety measures in place. However, many summer 2020 releases had already been moved, including the film of Quiara Alegría Hudes and Miranda’s&nbsp;“in the Heights,” has been rescheduled for June 2021.</p>
<p>“Hamilton” for the screen features the original cast, including Tony Award-winners and Carnegie Mellon University graduates Leslie Odom Jr. and Renee Elise Goldsberry. Daveed Diggs also won a featured actor in a musical Tony — the show won 11 of a record 16 nominations and was still filling seats on Broadway and on tour when the coronavirus ended its run.</p>
<p>The live show played in Pittsburgh in January 2019 and is due in Pittsburgh again in January 2021.</p>
<p>Ahead of the availability of “Hamilton,” Disney+ this week dropped its free trial offers. The streaming service costs $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year, or, bundled with Hulu and ESPN+, $12.99 a month.</p>
