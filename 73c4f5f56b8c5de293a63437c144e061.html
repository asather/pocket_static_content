<h1>Pirates get positive tests, proceed with caution under new COVID-19 restrictions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>All Major League Baseball teams have had to adapt, following the league’s COVID-19 protocols as best they can, but the Pirates are in a more unique situation than most.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening, Allegheny County mandated a one-week period during which bars, restaurants and casinos would close and gatherings of 25 people or more would be prohibited.</p>
<p>While a county health department spokesperson told the Post-Gazette that the 25-person limit only applied to non-businesses and had no knowledge of any discussions between the health director and the Pirates, it’s important to examine the language of the order.</p>
<p>Allegheny County does not have regulations specifically for pro sports, but for youth sports offers the following:</p>
<p>• Youth sports and team practices should not exceed 25 per group</p>
<p>• Games should not exceed groups of 25</p>
<p>Operating out of an abundance of caution, the Pirates have kept outsiders away during the first two summer camp practices and appear to be following that same line of thinking when it comes to intrasquad scrimmages.</p>
<p>The reaction could be seen as a temporary inconvenience for the Pirates, assuming it's lifted after a week.</p>
<p>“We're still dealing with the 25 person [order] in terms of the Allegheny County thing,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “In terms of doing that, yeah, we can probably play a simulated game if we wanted to. We can simulate it in different ways. Again, we would not be at full intensity.”</p>
<p>Part of that is due to health concerns relating to pushing players who have been off for three months too hard, too soon. The last thing the Pirates need, with a 60-game sprint looming, is an injury to an important player in summer camp.</p>
<p>It's also been complicated because of the recent spike in COVID-19 cases in Allegheny County, forcing the Pirates to wait a little longer than some of their competitors.</p>
<p>“As soon we could play a simulated game, I would like to do that,” Shelton said. “But until we get different guidelines handed down to use, then we'll abide by what the county's put in place.”</p>
<p>If the Pirates are being overly cautious, it’s for good reason. On Friday, MLB released its COVID-19 test results. There were 3,185 samples collected, and there were 38 positive tests — 31 of which came from players. The other seven positive tests were from staff members. Nineteen of MLB’s 30 teams had one or more individuals test positive.</p>
<p>The Pirates are one of those 19 teams, Shelton said Friday. He didn’t say who tested positive, as teams aren’t allowed to divulge that information without consent from the player or staff member who produced that positive test.</p>
<p>“Organizationally, we have had some positive results,” Shelton said. “As you know, that’s as far as I can go. It’s something you’re gonna want to ask every day, but I’m not going to be able to answer it every day. A lot of teams have reported that they have them, and I would be shocked if we got through it and every team doesn’t have any.”</p>
<p>MLB teams, and specifically the Pirates, are proceeding slowly, knowing that even a small outbreak within the clubhouse could have dire consequences.</p>
<p>“Two or three guys can get it, and they can go down for however long they need to be quarantined,” first baseman Josh Bell said Saturday. “But from what we understand, you can get it once and still get it again, and from what we understand, one or two guys can turn into 10 or 15 guys really quickly, so to keep it from going from two to 15 is huge, and if it does get to 15, you have that 10- to 15-person window coming from your second affiliate, and it seems like if they have 10 or 15 guys with it, too, the season shuts down. I don’t know, the integrity of the game, it seems like that would happen. So it’s really important.”</p>
<p>For now, that means taking every precaution possible. The Pirates aren’t necessarily at a competitive disadvantage yet, Shelton said, since they are still putting in work, getting live at-bats and letting their pitchers do what’s necessary to prepare for the season.</p>
<p>There is the possibility, though, that the county’s 25-person restriction could last longer than just a week. Shelton isn’t worried about that yet, but he could see it posing a problem if that were to happen.</p>
<p>“I think that's one of the bridges we'll cross when we get to it,” Shelton said. “The most important thing for us is going to be live [at-bats], and we can facilitate that. We facilitated that today in a three-tier workout and all the pitches that we needed. [Bench coach Don Kelly has] done a really good job of shuffling hitters in to make sure that everybody's getting their at-bats. Because of the smaller groups, and we had a five-inning game today, and if there's four or five guys hitting, you can get a ton of at-bats doing that. That doesn't concern me. If we got another week out, or another 10 days out, then I would definitely be concerned about the competitive portion of it."</p>
