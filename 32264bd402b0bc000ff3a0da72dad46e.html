<h1>Pittsburgh adopts hiring freeze, leaves 64 positions vacant</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The City of Pittsburgh will leave more than 60 positions unfilled as a cost-savings measure against the pandemic-induced fiscal crisis.</p>
<p>The city estimates that the hiring freeze for 64 positions across 17 department and bureaus will save $3 million in salaries.</p>
<p>City department directors are also being asked to cut non-personnel spending by 10% citywide, according to the Monday announcement. No other budget cuts have been announced.</p>
<p>“The dedication and perseverance of city workers, especially those working on the front lines, has been on full display during this pandemic, and on behalf of all city residents I can’t thank them enough for their public service,” said Mayor Bill Peduto in a press release. “We have to put on hold these new hires, however, to help fill the ever-widening holes showing up in our budget due to this crisis.”</p>
<p>Among the departments and bureaus to leave positions unfilled are police, parks and recreation, mobility and infrastructure, and city planning.</p>
<p>Forty-three percent of the city’s $608 million <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/omb/budgets-reports" target="_blank">operating budget for 2020</a> is allocated to salaries and wages. Another 33.5% is budgeted for employee benefits.</p>
<p>The city had just over 3,500 full-time employees at the end of 2019, according to employment records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The administration forecasts that the city could lose $127 million in revenue in 2020, dropping from a projected $608 million to $481 million. The administration further estimates a $239 million loss over the next five years.</p>
