<p>Last year, Wiz Khalifa had his own Primanti’s sandwich.</p>
<p>Now, rap superstar from Pittsburgh&nbsp;is making his move into the restaurant market.</p>
<p>Khalifa, who already has his own marijuana brand and video game, has partnered with the Denver-based Nextbite for HotBox by Wiz, a delivery-only restaurant chain beginning Oct. 1.</p>
<p>It will feature his personal favorite dishes, with menu items that include Blazed Ends, crispy, savory burnt brisket ends smothered in a smoky sweet BBQ sauce; Taylor Gang Turkey Burger, a turkey patty topped with crisp lettuce, tomato &amp; onion, creamy mayo and a side of Chip Hits (crispy house-made chips tossed in parmesan and lemon); Mac &amp; Yellow, a gooey bowl of mac &amp; cheese with even more cheese on top; and for dessert, the Mile High Dark Chocolate Brownie.</p>
<p>Initially, it will be available via all major online delivery apps in Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago, Denver, D.C, Indianapolis, Houston and New York City. Additional locations will be launched monthly based on fan voting here.</p>
<p>Nextbite is a company that creates delivery-only restaurant concepts available through delivery apps.&nbsp;It partners with local restaurateurs for such brands Grilled Cheese Society, Monster Mac, Mother Clucker, Outlaw Burger, Empire Burrito, Jenny’s Biscuit, Atomic Wings and Ghost Grille.</p>
