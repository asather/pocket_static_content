<h1>Gerry Dulac: Can the laid-back style of 'The Match' translate to major golf?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Even though Tiger Woods was his usual detached self for most of the back nine, the celebrity match that included Phil Mickelson and the two best quarterbacks of our generation was more than the most-watched golf event in the history of cable television. It was also downright entertaining — rain, blurry cameras and all.</p>
<p>Turner’s use of cameras placed in the front and back of each personalized cart, the ability of the players to talk with the studio hosts, particularly with the garrulous Charles Barkley, and the incessant chatter of Mickelson and Peyton Manning proved that golf can be made infinitely appealing on television, even if it is just an exhibition.</p>
<p>The question now is: Can the networks that cover the PGA Tour borrow any of those production elements to liven their broadcasts when real-live tournament play resumes June 11 at the Charles Schwab Challenge?</p>
<p>I doubt it. But they should.</p>
<p>Turner Sports, which televised “The Match: Champions for Charity” at the Medalist Club in Hobe Sound, Fla., said the event attracted an average of 5.8 million viewers across four of its networks, making it the most-watched golf telecast in cable TV history. It not only broke what was said to be the previous record of 4.9 million viewers on ESPN at the 2010 Masters — the year Woods returned to golf for the first time since the scandal in his personal life — it more than doubled the average viewership for the two-team skins game the previous week featuring Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff. NBC Sports said that event attracted 2.35 million viewers across all its formats.</p>
<p>Granted, viewership numbers for tournament golf, especially majors, blow away the numbers posted by Turner Sports. For example, the final round of the 2019 Masters, when Woods won his first major in 11 years and fifth green jacket, had an average of 10.8 million viewers on CBS, including spiking to 12.1 million around the time Woods was finishing Sunday afternoon. A year earlier, the final round of the Masters drew an average of 13 million viewers.</p>
<p>But in these different times with no galleries, CBS and NBC might have to take some different, if not innovative, measures to compensate for the lack of crowd noise at regular PGA Tour events.</p>
<p>OK, they won’t have the use of those customized carts that raced around Medalist as though it were a NASCAR event. And it is unlikely players will be strapped with audio equipment to talk with Jim Nantz and Nick Faldo in the tower (or wherever the lead announcers might be located). Heck, player and caddie don’t like it when their on-course discussions are picked up by boom mics, as if someone is trying to steal KFC’s secret recipe for crispy chicken.</p>
<p>Maybe they should consider using Peyton Manning as an on-course reporter. Or even Barkley. To that point, major kudos to Justin Thomas for trading in his clubs for a microphone and smashing it as a first-time on-course commentator.</p>
<p>Or maybe we should just leave well enough alone and let the players provide the entertainment and excitement. Even if it will be quiet out there on the golf course.</p>
<p><strong>Picking up the pace</strong></p>
<p>Slow play? What slow play?</p>
<p>One of the benefits of the restrictions placed on courses during the COVID-19 pandemic is that rounds are being played at a much quicker pace. Players riding in single carts and not being allowed to pull the flagstick have not only eliminated five-hour rounds, it has almost made the four-hour round a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Throw in players not having to rake bunkers and 12- to 15-minute starting times designed to prevent backups, and 18-hole rounds are being played in 3 ½ hours, sometimes even quicker.</p>
<p>The irony here, though, is the improved pace of play comes at a time when players would be glad to spend as much time as possible on the course, particularly after the governor’s two-month stay-at-home order.</p>
<p>Nobody probably would have complained if the rounds were lasting five hours.</p>
<p><strong>Fresh faces</strong></p>
<p>The Frank B. Fuhrer Invitational, scheduled for June 29-July 1 at the Pittsburgh Field Club, will include defending champ Mike Gligic and the player whom he defeated in an eight-hole playoff, Steve Wheatcroft.</p>
<p>Gligic earned a battlefield promotion to the PGA Tour in 2020 after winning the Korn Ferry Tour’s Panama Open in 2019. Wheatcroft, a Washington, Pa., native who won twice on the Korn Ferry Tour, played six seasons on the PGA Tour but decided to retire from competitive golf this year.</p>
<p>But the select 40-player field will have a bit of a hockey element with the inclusion of former NHL player Jeremy Roenick and amateur Austin Lemieux, Mario’s son.</p>
<p>It will also include Justin Moose, the sixth-ranked long driver in the world who was runner-up in the 2018 World Long Drive Championship. Moose’s swing speed has been clocked at 147 mph in long-drive competitions, but it “slows” to an average of 128 when he is preparing to play a competitive 18-hole round. Several of the longest players on the PGA Tour, including McIlroy and Brooks Koepka, have an average swing speed of 122 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Moose, a North Huntington native, has been playing more golf because the World Long Drive Tour is shut down until September because of the pandemic. He said he has lost 15 pounds, down to 235, because he has been walking when he’s playing.</p>
<p>“I have so much time off I’ve really been able to rededicate myself to golf, and falling back in love with golf is a magical story for me,” Moose said. “I finally got time to put time in my short game. I’ve been fortunate to play with a few PGA Tour guys and got a few tips from them. I realized why it means so much to me.”</p>
<p><strong>West Penn update</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The West Penn Open, originally scheduled for June 22-24 at St. Clair CC, has been moved to Aug. 3-4 at Shannopin CC. The tournament has been reduced to 36 holes with a limited field of 54 players and no cut. The 120th West Penn Amateur, the oldest tournament in Western Pennsylvania, is still scheduled for July 6-7 at Allegheny CC. It also has been shortened to 36 holes with a field of 54 players.</p>
<p>The Tri-State PGA will begin its season June 3 at Wildwood CC with the Golf Max Head Pro Championship. The 18-hole field is limited to 32 players.</p>
