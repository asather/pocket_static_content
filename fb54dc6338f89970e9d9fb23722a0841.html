<h1>Experts say stock buy may be ethics issue</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON —&nbsp;This spring, Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, was front and center on Capitol Hill in pressing the Trump administration to launch an investigation into foreign steel imports that had long threatened the fate of a steel plant in Butler that employed about 1,400 of his constituents just down the road from his home.</p>
<p>When the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a probe on May 4, Mr. Kelly had another reason to cheer: His wife, just five days earlier on April 29, had purchased $15,001 to $50,000 in stock in Cleveland-Cliffs, the company he had advocated for. The stock has trended upward in the weeks since the purchase. At the closing bell on Friday, Cleveland-Cliffs stock was up 48% since April 29.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>The stock purchase, disclosed as required by U.S. House rules, created a scenario in which Mr. Kelly’s spouse, Victoria Kelly, may have gained personally from the actions of his public office, Congressional ethics experts said in interviews. The House code prohibits members&nbsp;and staff from “improperly using their official positions for personal gain,” the ethics manual states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stock purchase came at a time when Mr. Kelly was intimately involved in advocating, both publicly and privately, on behalf of the company for federal trade protections. His staffers also were involved in discussions with the company and Commerce Department officials about the federal trade investigations the week his wife made the stock purchase.</p>
<p>The day before Mr. Kelly’s wife made the stock buy, the Commerce Department gave Cleveland-Cliffs verbal confirmation an investigation would be announced, according to two people involved with the discussions.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly and his wife, through a spokesperson, declined to be interviewed for this story. The company, based in Ohio, did not respond to requests for comment. There is no current investigation into the stock trade.</p>
<p>In a statement, the spokesperson, Andrew Eisenberger, said Victoria Kelly decided to invest in Cleveland-Cliffs as a display of support for a local company.</p>
<p>“At a time when the entire Butler community is rallying to save the AK Steel plant and its 1,400 jobs, Representative Kelly’s wife made a small investment to show her support for the workers and management of this 100-year old bedrock of their hometown, where they both are life-long residents,” Mr. Eisenberger wrote.</p>
<p>Asked whether Mr. Kelly or his wife knew about the coming investigation at the time of the stock purchase, Mr. Eisenberger responded that whether a trade investigation would be launched “was uncertain until Secretary [of Commerce Wilbur] Ross confirmed the plan in a private phone conversation with the congressman on May 1.”</p>
<p>The stock purchase, which came to light during a regular review by the Post-Gazette of lawmakers’ financial records, showed how the line between advocating for constituents and receiving personal gain can become blurred.</p>
<p>Steel companies aggressively have pursued trade protections in Washington, prompting a pushback from U.S. manufacturers that purchase steel from other countries. Companies often turned to members of Congress for vocal support, and Mr. Kelly has been on both sides of the debate.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly has supported the steel trade protections while also pressing the administration for exemptions for companies like NLMK Pennsylvania, whose Mercer County plant has paid tariffs on steel imports from Brazil.</p>
<p>When such advocacy is mixed with personal financial incentives, lawmakers run the risk of ethical breaches, according to ethics experts.</p>
<p>“You cannot push for ​government action to benefit a ​specific company where you are then going to get a ​direct financial benefit yourself,” said Kedric Payne, general counsel and senior director of ethics for Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan ethics watchdog group based in Washington.</p>
<p>“When you ​lobby Commerce ​to take action to benefit a ​specific company, and then you have stock in that company, that’s where a ​potential violation occurs,” said Mr. Payne, who previously spent six years at the Office of Congressional Ethics investigating lawmakers for questionable stock transactions and other ethical matters.</p>
<p><strong>A small move</strong></p>
<p>The Cleveland-Cliffs purchase was a small part of Ms. Kelly’s overall financial portfolio. Mr. Kelly’s financial disclosure statement from 2019 listed more than 126 financial investments in his wife’s name — 80 stocks, 28 bonds, and 18 mutual funds.</p>
<p>In 2019, Mr. Kelly reported his wife made 183 transactions, most of them selling stock in a broad range of companies, including those in health care, technology, energy and financial sectors. That year, she bought somewhere between $50,050 and $750,000 worth of stock and sold between $697,092 and $2.9 million worth of stock. (House rules require members report only ranges of valuations.)</p>
<p>The stock price’s rise since April 29 would suggest a profit of about&nbsp;$7,200 to $24,000 depending on her initial investment, if Ms. Kelly sold on Friday —&nbsp;a small fraction of Ms. Kelly’s stock trades.</p>
<p>As Mr. Eisenberger stated, Ms. Kelly made the personal decision to invest in Cleveland-Cliffs that was unrelated to a broader portfolio move. Ms. Kelly did not own stock in steel companies or any other public companies in the district. Mr. Kelly’s financial disclosures show Cleveland-Cliffs was the only stock purchase his wife made in 2020.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelly’s wealth derives at least partially from her family’s energy business.</p>
<p>Phillips Resources which was purchased by ExxonMobil in 2011 at a time natural gas drilling was booming in Pennsylvania, and, around the same time, T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co., a related natural gas utility company, was purchased by the owners of North Shore-based Peoples Natural Gas. Ms. Kelly sold ownership stakes in the two companies worth at least $10 million that year.</p>
<p>As that transaction closed, Mr. Kelly sold $6 million in shares he held in the two companies. The timing of the sale came under some scrutiny as the process was still in motion as Mr. Kelly joined Congress in 2011 — and participated in a vote against a motion to eliminate tax benefits for oil and gas companies. (Mr. Kelly’s spokesperson at the time called the criticism “nothing more than a campaign-style hit piece that has zero foundation in the truth.”)</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly had garnered his own wealth, too, running the car dealership business started by his father in Butler. He is regularly listed as among the wealthiest members of Congress by CQ Roll Call, a Capitol Hill publication, which has ranked him in the top 50 for the last several years. In 2018, Mr. Kelly’s net worth was estimated at $12.4 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly’s financial disclosures list all stocks, bonds and mutual fund investments in his wife’s name, and his financial portfolio before joining Congress is unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Unusual case</strong></p>
<p>What makes Mr. Kelly’s case unusual, ethics experts said, is that his wife bought stock in a single employer operating in his district — and the purchase was made right around the time a major event that he had used his public position to advocate for.</p>
<p>The House Ethics Manual, last revised in 2008, prohibits members from profiting personally from public actions. The financial interests of spouses — whose stock trades are required to be reported along with members’ trades — are considered by ethics investigators to be inseparable from the members’ interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although members may characterize an investment in companies in their districts as aligning their financial interests with their constituents, the investment “undermines their ability to effectively represent their constituents,” said Bryson B. Morgan, who served as an investigative counsel at the U.S. House of Representatives Office of Congressional Ethics from 2013 to 2015.</p>
<p>Mr. Morgan&nbsp;said that the size of member or spouse’s wealth — and the motivations behind any given stock trade — is outside of the core ethical concerns he considered when prosecuting cases in the House.</p>
<p>“His spouse’s sizable investment in the company significantly impairs his ability to advance that company’s interests in Washington without running afoul of conflict of interest rules,” said Mr. Morgan, currently a political law attorney at Caplin &amp; Drysdale in Washington.</p>
<p>But Stanley Brand, a Penn State law professor and former U.S. House general counsel, he did not see ethical red flags in the Cleveland-Cliffs stock purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Mr. Kelly had recused himself from pressing for an investigation, the company and its workers would be&nbsp;“disenfranchised” from having representing in Washington, he said.</p>
<p>“It’s a company in his district, where the presumption is a member is going to assist the constituent navigating the shoals of the federal government,” said Mr. Brand, who defended roughly 120 House members and staff in such cases over four decades.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelly’s explanation that she wanted to assist a local company in need only “adds weight to the notion that you can’t disenfranchise this company from seeking assistance that is otherwise legitimate because the spouse owns some shares in the company, especially a publicly traded company,” Mr. Brand said.</p>
<p>In complicated cases, the spirit of the House ethics code relies on public disclosure and electoral action rather than enforcement.&nbsp;In other words, constituents can see all the financial documents and stock trades and decide whether there is a conflict of interest, Mr. Brand said.</p>
<p>“The public will know what his ownership interest is, and they can judge for themselves whether they think that’s appropriate or not,” Mr. Brand said. “The disclosure there is the remedy.”&nbsp;</p>
