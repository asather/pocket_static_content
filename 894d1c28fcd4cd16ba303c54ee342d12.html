<h1>Five evaluations the Steelers must make when they return to the field</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With the NFL getting closer to letting coaches and players return to their facilities, the Steelers are hoping they can start doing something more than having virtual playbook meetings and begin to find answers to some of the issues that confront them.</p>
<p>And the only place that can happen is the football field.</p>
<p>Right now, the only thing coach Mike Tomlin and his staff have been able to ascertain through endless Zoom calls is which of the new players have been able to best pick up the offense or defense. But learning the playbook is one thing. Executing what they have learned is another.</p>
<p>Typically, offseason training activities, where players practice in shorts with no contact (and sometimes no veterans), offer little in the way of evaluation. But these days, getting back on the field for a possible minicamp will seem like the fourth quarter of a December game in Baltimore to the coaches.</p>
<p>One thing the Steelers don’t want to do when they get back on the practice field is be in any hurry to test Ben Roethlisberger’s surgically repaired throwing elbow. Roethlisberger has been throwing without discomfort, and his spin rate —&nbsp;the most important measure of his throwing ability, along with velocity — has been very good, according to sources.</p>
<p>While Roethlisberger’s progress is good news for the Steelers, they also have tried to temper workouts like <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2020/05/18/pittsburgh-steelers-ben-roethlisberger-beard-throw-football-video-ron-cook/stories/202005190031" target="_blank">the one two weeks ago</a> at Quaker Valley High School by reminding him the start of the regular season is still three months away. From a position and talent standpoint, the Steelers have five important evaluations to make once they get on the field. Here is a look at each:</p>
<p><strong>1. What to do at inside linebacker</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t just a question of what, but with whom? And for how long?</p>
<p>The Steelers know Vince Williams, 30, can be the starter alongside Devin Bush, but his run-stopping style does not always blend with the team’s penchant for predominantly relying on their sub-package defenses. That makes him a liability in pass coverage and a target for opposing quarterbacks when he’s matched on a running back or tight end.</p>
<p>The Steelers want to find out who will line up with Bush in their nickel and dime packages. Ulysees Gilbert III, last year’s sixth-round choice from Akron, might appear to be the leading candidate because he is the top returnee after the release of Mark Barron and the free-agent defection of Tyler Matakevich.</p>
<p>But they will try safety Marcus Allen in that role and also look at safety Terrell Edmunds in certain packages. The latter depends on whether rookie Antoine Brooks, a hybrid safety/linebacker at Maryland, can develop quickly enough to fill Edmunds’ role (more on that later).</p>
<p>In case anyone is wondering, the possibility of the Steelers adding a veteran player to help stabilize the position is highly unlikely, barring a serious series of injuries. After all, their recent track record of bringing in free agents at that position — Jon Bostic, Morgan Burnett and Barron — is not very good. Neither, according to team sources, is the possibility the Steelers could bring back Barron, who never practiced more than one day a week because of nagging injuries.</p>
<p><strong>2. Where will Chris Wormley be used?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest hole on defense, if there is one, is at nose tackle, where the loss of Javon Hargrave in free agency has appeared to create a public concern that is disproportionate from reality.</p>
<p>Hargrave was a nice find as a third-round choice in 2016 whose quickness and push at a relatively small size made him more of the modern-day nose tackle (the Baltimore Ravens might disagree). But his departure is easily compensated by the return of defensive end Stephon Tuitt, who missed the final 10 games in 2019 with a season-ending pectoral injury.</p>
<p>That, though, forced the Steelers to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/20/eric-ebron-steelers-ravens-trade-chris-wormley-2020-free-agency/stories/202003200098" target="_blank">make a trade with the Ravens</a> to acquire Wormley, a third-round draft choice in 2017 who, at 6-foot-5, 298 pounds, is a much different body type than Hargrave. Wormley wasn’t acquired to replace Hargrave in the team’s 3-4 defense as much as he was to be a backup to Tuitt and All-Pro defensive end Cam Heyward in defensive line coach Karl Dunbar’s rotational system.</p>
<p>Tomlin and general manager Kevin Colbert have indicated Wormley could be used at nose tackle, but that seems unlikely. Still, they need to find where he is most productive, figure out the best spot where he can match Hargrave’s total of 6½ sacks in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>3. How much can Anthony McFarland Jr. be a factor?</strong></p>
<p>McFarland is a big-play running back who won’t get a lot of snaps behind James Conner and Benny Snell Jr., but the Steelers need to find productive ways to incorporate their fourth-round draft choice into the offense.</p>
<p>Problem is, they won’t have a lot of time to figure out the best way to utilize his speed and play-making ability — something their other running backs don’t offer — once they get back on the field.</p>
<p>McFarland will be given a handful of plays, specific to his abilities, to lessen his rookie learning curve. But the Steelers have to be patient with his abilities if they believe he can make a difference in their offense.</p>
<p><strong>4. Can Antoine Brooks be a competent backup safety or hybrid linebacker?</strong></p>
<p>It is difficult, if not mere folly, to expect a sixth-round draft choice with no offseason prep and possibly no preseason games to be a factor in a defense, especially a defense with eight veteran starters who don’t need a simplified scheme.</p>
<p>But the Steelers will give Brooks a chance at two positions, starting at strong safety. If he shows he can handle that position in some sub-package schemes, it could allow the coaches to use Edmunds as a dime linebacker in passing situations.</p>
<p>Brooks, though, was also used as a hybrid linebacker at Maryland, a position to which he could be more suited. At 5-foot-11, 215 pounds and known as a big hitter, Brooks could be in line to get a look alongside Bush. He is not a player who will simply be slotted into a role. The Steelers need to see him on the field to determine his value.</p>
<p><strong>5. Can Stefen Wisniewski hold off the challenge of Kevin Dotson?</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers brought in two new players at left guard as replacements for retired Ramon Foster — one 31, the other 23.</p>
<p>Wisniewski, who is with his fifth NFL team <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/15/stefen-wisniewski-steelers-pittsburgh-leo-steve-nfl-families/stories/202005140026" target="_blank">after signing in free agency</a>, will begin as the starter, whenever that is. He is competent enough as a former Super Bowl starter with the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs to even be an upgrade at the position.</p>
<p>But the Steelers are eager to see if Dotson, a dominating run blocker, is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/30/who-is-kevin-dotson-steelers-draft-2020-fourth-round-offensive-lineman-louisiana-ragin-cajuns/stories/202004290036" target="_blank">as good as they think he is</a>, despite lasting until the fourth round of the draft. Part of that, though, will be to see how well he can protect Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>By bringing in Wisniewski, the Steelers do not have to worry about the rapidity of Dotson’s development. But getting to see him on the field and evaluating his ability will be among the top items on their to-do list.</p>
