<h1>County Council members Bennett, Hallam want to ban 'less lethal' crowd control devices</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two Allegheny County Council members are aiming to ban all “less lethal” crowd control measures, including tear gas and bean bag rounds deployed by police <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/01/Protesters-police-clash-East-Liberty-Pittsburgh-tear-gas-riots/stories/202006010115" target="_blank">at recent local protests</a>&nbsp;sparked by the death of African American man George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>Members Bethany Hallam, D-At large, and Olivia Bennett, D-Northview Heights, are introducing the measure Tuesday and proposing that the ordinance be enforced under the county’s health code.</p>
<p>The proposal, which would carry a penalty of up to $300 and 30 days imprisonment, specifically defines categories of chemical, explosive and kinetic devices meant to disperse a crowd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Even though they're called less lethal, very often they are lethal or cause permanent damage. We’ve seen the stories of the rubber bullets injuring people and have seen people go to the hospital for tear gas inhalation,” said Ms. Hallam.&nbsp;“... These kind of less lethal tools are used indiscriminately and harm everyone in a crowd.”</p>
<p>The proposed ordinance would only apply to crowd control, meaning the use of personal peppy sprays for&nbsp;“self-defense situations” would not become illegal.</p>
<p>“The police still have the full authority to arrest anyone in specific instances of crimes being committed, but they shouldn’t have the ability to harm all of those in a crowd exercising their constitutional rights,” Ms. Hallam said.</p>
<p>Ms. Bennett declined to comment to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>County Council will meet remotely at 5 p.m. Meetings can be viewed at&nbsp;<a href="https://alleghenycounty.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx" target="_blank">alleghenycounty.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx</a>.</p>
