<h1>No no-hitter, but Pirates struggle again as White Sox complete sweep</h1>

<p>CHICAGO — Cole Tucker ripped a single up the middle on the first pitch of Wednesday’s game against the White Sox. In that sense, it was already more successful than Tuesday’s outing, when the Pirates were no-hit by Chicago’s Lucas Giolito.</p>
<p>In pretty much every other sense, Wednesday was more of the same.</p>
<p>As had happened 18 other times in their 25 previous games this season, the Pirates lost. This time, the final was 10-3, as they fell to 7-19, the worst record in Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>“We just have to move on,” manager Derek Shelton said after the game. “Last night we talked about how well it was pitched, and then today the game got away from us fairly early. Continue to fight back. We just didn’t have enough offensive opportunities.”</p>
<p>By the end of the second inning, the Pirates were already reeling. Right-hander Trevor Williams started the game, and after a 1-2-3 first, he struggled in the second, allowing a walk, a double, a sacrifice fly, a single and a home run to five consecutive hitters, accounting for four runs.</p>
<p>Presumably, because of the grind the Pirates have ahead of them with 13 games in the next 11 days, they needed Williams to eat up some innings, so they left him out there for six innings.</p>
<p>He gave up a solo home run to Edwin Encarnacion in the fourth and a three-run bomb from Yoan Moncada in the fifth, pitched one more scoreless inning after that and departed with an eight-run blemish on his outing.</p>
<p>“I mean, I executed some pitches that got hit today,” Williams said. “I mis-executed some pitches that got hit. Really, the only one today that I thought got me good was Encarnacion’s (homer). I thought we executed the game plan we wanted to do. Sometimes, it’s a game of inches and I firmly believe a total of maybe 10 inches today and it’s a different ballgame, a different score.”</p>
<p>That is not ideal for winning a baseball game, but the offense struggled again, too, in their second straight game without infielders Colin Moran and Kevin Newman. Until the fifth inning, Tucker was the only Pirate to register a hit — he singled in the first and third — off White Sox lefty Dallas Keuchel. Infielder Jose Osuna changed that in the fifth with a single to left center, but even that was with two outs and produced nothing substantial in terms of a run-scoring threat.</p>
<p>In the sixth, the Pirates generated runs for the first time since Sunday’s series finale against the Milwaukee Brewers. Even then, though, it was mostly produced by walks instead of hits.</p>
<p>Keuchel walked Tucker, left fielder Bryan Reynolds and right fielder Gregory Polanco to load the bases before catcher Jacob Stallings drove in two runs with a single to right center.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ only extra-base hit of the game came after it was sealed. Already trailing 10-2, shortstop Erik Gonzalez stepped up and ripped a ball deep to left field, barely clearing the wall for his second homer of the season.</p>
<p>It was a small reminder of the way he had been hitting earlier in the season, when he got off to a scalding hot start. As far as the end result of the game, though, it meant nothing.</p>
<p>“I think we’re all frustrated to a certain level, but playing frustrated doesn’t help anything,” Stallings said. “I think I learned that a little while ago in my career, and I don’t know, losing kind of exemplifies every negative aspect of what’s going on. So, I mean, it manifests itself in a lot of ways, and it’s definitely hard to combat when you’re not having good results.”</p>
<p>Any momentum the Pirates may have gained from their three-game sweep of the Brewers last weekend has disappeared. Familiarly, the Pirates will move to their next series — a doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals — in search of more answers.</p>
<p>“Right now, it’s just not happening that consistently, which is frustrating, but we’ve got two opportunities to go out tomorrow and make those moments happen and (three) more this weekend with the Milwaukee series,” Tucker said. “So we’re just trying to keep it rolling and pressing on like we have been. It’s easy to get down. It’s easy to be frustrated, but we know that we have a lot of baseball ahead of us and we’re just going to try to stay positive and optimistic to do that.”</p>
