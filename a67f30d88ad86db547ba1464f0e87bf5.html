<h1>Pirates on pause: How will the NL Central shake out in 2020?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With MLB hoping to return soon, the Post-Gazette’s Jason Mackey and Mike Persak will analyze 20 issues related to the Pirates — think 20 Thoughts or questions about the team. They’ll run each weekday online through May 22 and will appear in print (or via other PG digital platforms) on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</em></p>
<p>For a time, it looked like the Pirates might not be playing their NL Central brethren this season.</p>
<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic delaying the 2020 season, one of the leaked possibilities for a return to play included mismatched divisions in which the Pirates were tabbed to possibly play some of the East Coast teams.</p>
<p>While anything is still possible at this point, plans have begun to crystallize that look more normal in terms of divisional play, with some slight adjustments, like the AL Central and NL Central possibly merging.</p>
<p>Negotiations are still going on between MLB and the MLBPA, though, so it’s tough to know exactly how things will look if/when baseball returns.</p>
<p>Plus, the NL Central is tough enough to predict on its own. We’ll take a stab at it anyway.</p>
<p>We’ll get the Pirates out of the way first.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, most people are counting the Pirates out of the division race before the season even begins. The players know this, too. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/05/07/Pirates-Joe-Musgrove-surprise-people-Derek-Shelton-underrated-expectations-COVID-19/stories/202005070182" target="_blank">Joe Musgrove told the Post-Gazette</a>&nbsp;as much last week.</p>
<p>For now, we’ll leave it at that and move to the rest of the division.</p>
<p>The question that a lot of NL Central predictions seem to balance on is whether you believe in returning, proven talent that’s gotten another year older or a new, unknown commodity.</p>
<p>The latter category is referring to the Cincinnati Reds. They spent big at the 2019 trade deadline and during the offseason. Right-hander Trevor Bauer struggled after going from the Cleveland Indians to Cincinnati in July of last season, pitching to a 6.39 ERA in 56.1 innings. Still, he has past success to lean on, and he’s joined by 2019 All-Stars Luis Castillo and Sonny Gray, who was traded from the New York Yankees in January, in the rotation.</p>
<p>On the offensive side, the Reds signed outfielder Nick Castellanos and second baseman Mike Moustakas out of free agency to pair with third baseman Eugenio Suarez. The three of them combined for 111 home runs last season and will pose a big threat in Cincinnati’s home-run-friendly ballpark.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the real unknown: 32-year-old outfielder Shogo Akiyama, whom the Reds signed from Japan in January. Akiyama was a table-setting machine in Japan, with an on-base percentage of at least .385 in each of his last five seasons.</p>
<p>The question for the Reds is how the group will mesh together. Bauer needs to find his old form, Gray is another year older. First baseman Joey Votto, who has anchored the Reds’ lineup for years, still gets on base but doesn’t have the power he once had. Nonetheless, the Reds are a popular pick to take a leap to the top of the division in 2020.</p>
<p>The other three teams have more of a track record.</p>
<p>The Chicago Cubs still have the same core group of guys in the lineup as they did when they won the 2016 World Series, but they have dealt with some off-field drama. Third baseman Kris Bryant is still a stud, but he’s fresh off a grievance with the Cubs over service time that has left his future with the club in question.</p>
<p>Plus, the team finished third in the division last season with a very similar roster, so expectations are a bit lower than one might think.</p>
<p>Still, Bryant, first baseman Anthony Rizzo, shortstop Javier Baez, outfielder Kyle Schwarber and the whole gang are still around for a reason: They are good baseball players. It doesn’t take a lot of imagination to see them putting their 2016 magic back together to make another run, and maybe first-year manager David Ross can help put that together.</p>
<p>The Milwaukee Brewers are in a somewhat similar position, but with a more recent division title in their rearview mirror. Their conversation starts with outfielder Christian Yelich, the 2018 NL MVP and two-time reigning NL batting champion. He’s joined by capable players like second baseman Keston Hiura, who hit .360 over 84 games in 2019, and outfielder Lorenzo Cain, who struggled by his standards last season but was a perennial .300 hitter before that.</p>
<p>All-Star catcher Yasmani Grandal is gone, but Omar Narvaez, who had 22 home runs with the Seattle Mariners last year, replaces him.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Brewers could be one of the greatest beneficiaries if the designated hitter is adopted for all teams in 2020. With Cain and Yelich holding down two outfield spots, Ryan Braun and Avisail Garcia, both capable hitters, are the contenders for the remaining outfield position. Braun can play some first base, too, but Justin Smoak has a claim to that spot. A DH spot in the lineup would allow the Brewers to fit all three.</p>
<p>On the pitching end, the Brewers’ starters won’t blow you away, but they’re solid. Right-hander Brandon Woodruff was an All-Star last year, striking out 10.6 batters per nine innings, and Brett Anderson and Adrian Houser each posted sub-4 ERAs in 2019. Plus, closer Josh Hader is still there and still lights-out, fresh off a 37-save season during which he struck out 16.4 batters per nine innings.</p>
<p>In St. Louis, the Cardinals made very few changes this offseason, but they didn’t need to after winning the division in 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First baseman Paul Goldschmidt saw his batting average dip to .260 last year, but he still had 34 homers and 97 RBIs. Shortstop Paul DeJong was an All-Star, and catcher Yadier Molina is still solid. Utility man Tommy Edman hit .304 in 92 games last year, too, and the rest of the lineup remains as good as you’d expect from a team that made the NLCS last year.</p>
<p>Pitching wise, Jack Flaherty finished fourth in Cy Young voting last season, and, at just 24 years old, there’s no reason to believe he’ll be slowing down. Miles Mikolas fell off a bit in 2019, but he was an All-Star two seasons ago. Adam Wainwright and Carlos Martinez help round out what could be the strongest rotation in the division. Plus,&nbsp;Giovanny Gallegos is a stud in the bullpen, Andrew Miller has a sterling track record and fireballer Jordan Hicks is set to return from Tommy John surgery in July.</p>
<p>If you’ve read all of that and are trying to find flaws in the division, you may have to squint. Part of the reason it’s so hard to predict the NL Central this season is because four of the five teams have real strength all around their rosters.</p>
<p><strong>STATISTICALLY SPEAKING:&nbsp;</strong>The Cardinals spent the least amount of new money in MLB this offseason, clocking in at just over $18 million, according to Spotrac.</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THIS:&nbsp;</strong>Other than from 2013-2015, when they finished in second place in their division all three seasons, the Pirates have finished in second place or higher just once since 1992.</p>
<p><strong>THEY SAID IT:&nbsp;</strong>“He was a clear fit for a few of the different areas we’d identified that we needed to improve this offseason. It was aggressive and I think Shogo even mentioned it, but there was a real clarity from our standpoint of wanting to make it happen.” Reds manager David Bell on Shogo Akiyama.</p>
