<p>A new blue-collar anthem has risen from the scrap heap, courtesy of John Vento &amp; The Nied’s Hotel Band.</p>
<p>Years ago, the group started on a song called “Sacred Land,” originated by Stephen Christopher, the band’s former guitarist.</p>

<p>“I joined the band on guitar after Stephen left and remembered liking the version of ‘Sacred Land’ that they had started,” guitarist Tim Hadley said in a statement. “The band eventually abandoned the tune, feeling it was too ‘Americana.’ Years later, I mentioned to John that I wanted to do my own arrangement of it for a proposed solo release of his. I rearranged some of Stephen’s chords and words, wrote the middle section and then got Stephen’s approval that we co-wrote the song…even though our contributions were years apart.”</p>
<p>The song, a patriotic heartland ballad that tells of the story of a working class family with a “grandpa in the steel mills and my uncles in the mines,” is out today with a lyric video depicting images of factories, soldiers and such heroes as Jackie Robinson, Martin Luther King Jr. and Roberto Clemente. Vento sings it in the gritty vein of Springsteen or Seger, with Mia Z from “The Voice” doing backing vocals.</p>
<p>The band, which had a home base at the now-shuttered Nied’s Hotel in Lawrenceville, has already been donating sales of their music to Band Together Pittsburgh, the nonprofit co-founded by Vento and Ron “Moondog” Esser to promote the Autism cause. A portion of the proceeds from the iTunes sales of “Sacred Ground” will benefit small businesses in Pittsburgh affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Vento said of the decision to release the song on Friday, “It’s a time in America where there’s so much talking down about this country…there’s so much negativity…we’re here to say that this is the greatest land in the world. We need to pull together and hold our heads high and remember what sacrifices generations past have made, so that we can live free. We’re proud to be Americans!”</p>
