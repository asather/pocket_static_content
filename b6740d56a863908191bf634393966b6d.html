<h1>Penguins GM Jim Rutherford expects NHL draft will follow NFL's virtual lead</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This weekend, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell welcomed America into his home — and onto his recliner — when the league held its first virtual draft.</p>
<p>A record 55 million viewers tuned in over the course of the three-day event. Count Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford among them. While he wasn’t necessarily glued to the TV waiting to see who the Browns picked in the seventh round, he did happen to catch “some” of it.</p>
<p>Soon, Rutherford might find himself on the other side of the screen.</p>
<p>The NHL initially planned to hold its draft June 26-27 in Montreal. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the league to cancel the event and, likely, change the format. While there are no concrete plans yet,&nbsp;chances are the NHL will follow the NFL’s virtual lead.</p>
<p>“The NFL did it in a way that’s the safest,” Rutherford said. “They did what they had to do. I suspect we’re going to do the same thing.”</p>
<p>As the NFL draft showed, there are some silver linings to a virtual experience. It gave fans a chance to meet Bill Belichick’s dog, visit Kliff Kingsbury’s swanky penthouse and wonder what the heck is up with Mike Vrabel’s sons.</p>
<p>Should the NHL choose a similar format, it will also give fans the chance to see front office personnel and league executives in a different, more personal way. Unfortunately, this also means there won’t be any walks on a red carpet and colorful suits to kick start careers.</p>
<p>“It’s a big day, certainly, in our league, where all the players and families go to the draft,” Rutherford said. “I feel bad for them that they’re not going to be able to do that. That’s the same as a lot of things. The kids can’t have their graduations now and all these things. It’s just one of many, many things that changes in our world today.”</p>
<p><strong>When could it happen?</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the FaceTime vs. Zoom debate, there are a number of details the NHL will need to work out.</p>
<p>Commissioner Gary Bettman reportedly floated the idea of holding the draft in June. Because the NHL season won’t be complete by then, the league would need to figure out the draft order. Points percentage isn’t a perfect solution, but a logical one.</p>
<p>This will allow teams to make their picks. But what about all the other business that typically happens around the draft?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Draft weekend is one of the most active windows for trades. Teams that want to move up offer players as compensation. Other teams with salary cap considerations use draft weekend to reshape the way their roster will impact their pocketbook. But if a season isn’t done, can you trade a player before a postseason run? Probably not.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What about conditional picks?</strong></p>
<p>Conditional picks are another detail that would need to be sorted out if the NHL chooses to hold the draft before the season is finished.</p>
<p>For some teams, this is a significant issue.&nbsp;For example, when the Calgary Flames traded James Neal to the Edmonton Oilers for Milan Lucic, it came with an interesting caveat. If Neal scored 21 goals or more and Lucic scored 10 fewer than Neal, the Flames get the Oilers’ third-round pick in 2020. When play was paused, Neal had 19 goals with 11 games remaining and Lucic had eight with 12 games left.&nbsp;See the problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though the Penguins made two trades this year that feature conditional picks, this is less of an issue for them than it is for other teams.&nbsp;First, if the Penguins fail to make the 2020 playoffs, the first-round pick they gave up for Jason Zucker can be optioned to 2021. But as long as the NHL decides it will play the postseason, the Penguins are in. So that’s not going to be a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other conditional pick is related to the Patrick Marleau trade. The 2021 third-round pick the Penguins gave up becomes a second-round pick if the Penguins win the Stanley Cup in 2020. But because that pick isn’t for another year, that’s not a pressing concern, either.</p>
<p><strong>Draft prep</strong></p>
<p>When the NHL does ultimately hold the draft, the Penguins are not scheduled to pick until the third round.&nbsp;That’s not the worst thing during this draft cycle. Canceling the scouting combine took away some evaluation time. Canceling the 2020 IIHF World U18 Championships may have hurt even more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That was the final grading period for scouts,” Rutherford said. “It is every year. It’s a very important tournament. Those adjustments have to be made.”</p>
<p>In case you’re keeping score at home, the Penguins’&nbsp;first-round pick was part of the compensation for Zucker and the second-round pick went to Vegas so that they would pick Marc-Andre Fleury in the expansion draft. Rutherford said that even with the unique circumstances and the uncertainty, the Penguins scouting department has done enough homework to be ready when it’s their turn on the clock</p>
<p>“I feel like our scouting staff had enough viewings of players that they’re ready for the draft,” Rutherford said. “We’re trying to find one or two players in the middle rounds, which we’ve been able to do before. I think we’re prepared.”</p>
<p>Hopefully Bettman’s recliner is ready, too.&nbsp;</p>
