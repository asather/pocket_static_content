<h1>Jason Mackey: Nerves, excitement and ‘something special’ for younger Pirates fans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The red-brick duplex on Bower Hill Road in Mt. Lebanon has probably never been cleaner.</p>
<p>Back on Oct. 1, 2013, as the Pirates played their first playoff game in more than two decades, I was not yet a beat writer covering a professional sports team; I was still very much a fan, in awe of everything instead of thinking about those mega moments, the logistical implications and how to best cover them.</p>
<p>And not only was I still a fan, I was an extraordinarily nervous one at that, someone who redirected his energy by cleaning everything imaginable inside the three-bedroom place my wife and I were renting at the time.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget that night, the same as anyone who has followed Pittsburgh sports. It was beyond special, which is why I think it’s a tremendous idea for AT&amp;T SportsNet to re-air that game on Tuesday night as part of an expanded Pirates and Penguins package to help us shelter at home and keep our sanity without live sports.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of that night, I know, extends to other houses, where other wives (or husbands) probably still make fun of their spouse’s antics or enthusiasm, where sitting down wasn’t necessarily a thing but swearing definitely was, where we all think that we saw something supernatural when Johnny Cueto somehow dropped that ball.</p>
<p>To re-live some of those memories, the way so many of you do without even thinking about it, I decided to call a few of my friends — another good idea while we’re all stuck at home — to ask what they remember most about that night.</p>
<p>“That atmosphere, it was nothing like I could ever remember for a Pirates game,” said Colin Pingree, who’s been one of my best friends since the first day of kindergarten and now works for the U.S. government and lives in Columbus, Ohio. “I think just because it had been so long since Pirates games actually mattered. You know the final drive of [Super Bowl XLIII]? That’s how I felt the entire game.”</p>
<p>Craig Rechichar, with whom I pitched at Westminster College, found himself in a similar situation. He and his wife, Monica, were at home. Their two girls were running around and playing, semi-oblivious to what was happening.</p>
<p>Craig, like me, is a stander. Not necessarily someone who screams at the TV, but the ability to just sit and watch … yeah, ain’t happening.</p>
<p>“I was relatively calm until Russell Martin hit [his first] home run,” Rechichar said of the moment where Johnny Cueto dropped the ball, then Martin blasted his next pitch into the left-center field bleachers. “I was definitely standing at that point. The ball drops. How perfect was that? Whether it was because of the crowd or whatever, to throw a meatball to Russell Martin and see him jack it? That was amazing.”</p>
<p>The coronavirus has taken our ability to congregate in groups and see the outside world. It has taken our live sports and traded those games for fear — fear of how bad this could become or what the athletic, economic or societal ramifications might be.</p>
<p>But starting at 7 p.m. Tuesday, we’ll get some sense of normalcy back: There will be a game worth watching on television.</p>
<p>Scott Labyoda, my longtime catcher growing up in Brentwood, was at the 2013 game. He and his wife, Caitlin, went with her parents, and they sat along the first-base line, a few rows below the spot from where AT&amp;T SportsNet does its pre- and postgame shows.</p>
<p>Scott and Caitlin left their daughter, McKinley, who was 4 months old back then, with one of Caitlin’s cousins, figuring it would be too loud and cold. But on Tuesday, they’re going to gather in front of the television and prove to McKinley that the Pirates did play in the playoffs before.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m definitely going to put that on,” Scott told me Tuesday during a break in work at UPMC Mercy, where he works as an electrician. “I wanna tell her, ‘Hey, me and mom were at that game, too.’ She’ll love it.”</p>
<p>That’s what I think is so cool about this. As Scott reminded me, his dad and his father-in-law, along with my own dad, had baseball championships to share. Plenty of them, really. Games and memories to recount to my generation of 30-somethings.</p>
<p>We don’t. We have … this. And every single one of us has a cool story or two about it.</p>
<p>Rechichar recalled specific moments from that season such as the Pirates finally clinching a winning season or a playoff spot. Pingree was actually laid off from work because of a government shutdown, making the whole thing “10 times better than it already was.” At the hospital, Labyoda said he wasn’t terribly productive that day. “Pretty much going through the motions,” he joked.</p>
<p>But how many times can my generation say something like that, especially about the Pirates?</p>
<p>“Being a part of that journey and watching that night was something I’ll never forget,” Rechichar said. “When I think of that three-year run of the Pirates, Russell Martin’s home run is what I think of first.”</p>
<p>I would agree with that. When you think back to 2013, the only things in that category, for me, would be Cueto dropping the ball, Martin’s homer(s) and just how loud everything was — and I’m pretty sure they’re all related.</p>
<p>Watching and pacing around my living room, dusting and waiting for the kitchen floor to dry, I’ll never forget the sound of the PNC Park crowd through the TV. I’m also excited to see what it sounds like again on Tuesday, when so much in my life has changed and now getting to share it with my kids.</p>
<p>“It was like watching a Steelers game at Three Rivers, that concrete disaster that I’m pretty sure was the loudest stadium ever built,” Pingree said. “That’s what it sounded like, even on TV. I just remember thinking that I had been to games at PNC Park, but it was nothing like that.”</p>
<p>The good part of Tuesday night, I suppose, is that we know the outcome. That was half the battle back then, right? The same as others, I remember having this overwhelmingly negative feeling, this fear that, because it’s the Pirates, whatever could possibly go wrong would.</p>
<p>Even as the game started, as I started to see the 40,487 at PNC Park let out that pent-up frustration, I refused to believe what was happening was real. So I remembering vacuuming, pacing and cleaning glass to pass the time. At least by the fifth inning, when the Pirates led by three, I could breathe.</p>
<p>“I honestly remember going into the game thinking, ‘They can’t win. Cueto is gonna throw a no-hitter,’ ” Pingree said. “I was just happy they had gotten there. Then they got a lead, and I switched completely. I thought, ‘There was no way the Pirates are losing this.’ … I mean, Cueto dropping the ball? That doesn’t happen in baseball. That’s absurd.”</p>
<p>Added Labyoda: “Our generation, we finally got to see something special.”</p>
