<h1>Pitt's 2020 class earns 'badge of honor' with online graduation ceremony</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With a virtual commencement that blended elements of a traditional ceremony with livestreamed and pre-recorded messages from school leaders, the University of Pittsburgh on Sunday awarded degrees to nearly 8,000 students in the Class of 2020, whose time on campus this spring was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>What would have been a gathering of thousands in Oakland's Petersen Events Center on Sunday was instead what the university touted as “the first online gathering of its kind in Pitt’s history” to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>Chancellor Patrick Gallagher thanked students for their sacrifices in the past two months — which meant leaving campus, in some cases coming home from overseas programs, distancing themselves from friends and classmates, and adjusting to online learning, he said.</p>
<p>“These are things that none of us wanted to have happen, but they were necessary,” Mr. Gallagher, speaking via a livestream from his home, told the class. And the measures were “designed to alleviate suffering and save lives.”</p>
<p>“This online celebration on a day which is typically one of our most important in-person events is part of that sacrifice. But it should be a badge of honor that you wear with pride. Despite all the interruptions and obstacles, you've earned your degree,” he said.</p>
<p>Students, families, and anyone tuning in online Sunday also heard brief remarks from Chris W. Bonneau, president of the University Senate, and Provost Ann Cudd, among others; music from the Pitt Men’s Glee Club; and a performance by members of Pitt’s Marching Band, recorded from their homes.</p>
<p>The school has said it still intends to hold an in-person gathering for graduates at some point but wanted to mark the milestone Sunday, on the date the ceremony had been scheduled to take place.</p>
<p>It awarded degrees to nearly 8,000 undergraduate, master’s, professional and doctoral candidates. Students were emailed a “virtual” diploma immediately after the ceremony.</p>
<p>Some students said they appreciated the school's efforts to still make it a special day.</p>
<p>Katie Belonus, a graduate of the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, said she enjoyed video messages incorporated into the ceremony from Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, U.S. Senators Bob Casey and Pat Toomey, and famous Pitt alumni and other Pittsburghers congratulating the graduates.</p>
<p>“It made me very proud of the university and the class overall,” she said.</p>
<p>Natalie Simmons, 21, who was virtually awarded her Bachelor of Arts degree Sunday, watched the ceremony from her parents' home.</p>
<p>While Ms. Simmons said she and most of her 2020 classmates were disappointed at not being able to celebrate this milestone in the traditional way, she said they are keeping it in perspective.</p>
<p>“Really, this [not having an in-person ceremony] is the least of the world's problems right now ... ,” she said. The world's in a pandemic, people are losing their lives,” she said.</p>
