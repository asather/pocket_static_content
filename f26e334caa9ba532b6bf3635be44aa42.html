<h1>Pennsylvania likely has first 'community spread' COVID-19 cases </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the first time in the COVID-19 outbreak in the state, Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Monday that the state presumes it already has one or two cases of community spread of the disease.</p>
<p>That is a significant step in the outbreak because having cases of community spread means that people who did not leave the region, or come in contact with someone already known to have the disease, contracted the respiratory disease from an unknown contact.</p>
<p>“There is a presumption that those very few patients — it’s one or two — have had community spread,” Dr. Levine said during an online press conference Monday.</p>
<p>Now that community spread has likely occurred in Pennsylvania, Dr. Levine said what the state is hoping with its statewide mitigation efforts is to avoid “sustained community spread,” where the cases start to grow exponentially without additional travel-related cases growing.</p>
<p>“We want to have mitigation efforts in place before that,” she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine did not specify where those one or two cases of community spread, but they appear to be on the eastern side of the Pennsylvania, where the bulk of the state’s 70 positive cases (as of Monday afternoon) have occurred.</p>
<p>Allegheny County spokeswoman Amie Downs said in an emailed answer to questions that none of the six COVID-19 cases in the county were community spread and all are thought to be travel-related, or from contact with someone already known to have COVID-19.</p>

<p>Highmark President and CEO David Holmberg said Monday that one of the county’s six cases occurred when a local resident came in contact with someone who’d become infected after traveling outside of Pennsylvania to a state that has seen widespread infections.</p>
<p>That kind of case is not considered community spread. But if that person also infected others, the people that person infected would be considered community spread.</p>
<p>The patient Mr. Holmberg referred to is one of three being treated in Highmark Health’s Allegheny Health Network hospitals, he said.</p>
<p>Another official, who asked to remain anonymous, was worried that one of the two cases identified on Sunday could have already caused community spread because the infected person described to officials multiple cases of close contact with large numbers of people prior to being confirmed with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Mr. Holmberg declined to say whether the previously-infected person was aware they had the virus and was supposed to self-quarantine, directing the inquiry to Allegheny County Health Department officials who were not immediately available.</p>
<p>But Mr. Holmberg did say the case underscores the importance of taking precautions, and that “if you travel to certain areas to self-isolate and recognize that it could be an issue.”</p>
<p>Mr. Holmberg’s remarks came following a media briefing Monday about Highmark Health’s preparations and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
