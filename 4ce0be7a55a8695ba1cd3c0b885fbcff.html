<p>MADRID — Spain has registered its first daily death toll of fewer than 100 confirmed fatalities since declaring a state of emergency to fight the coronavirus two months ago.</p>
<p>Spain’s health minister says regional authorities have reported 87 new deaths, the lowest daily count since March 16. Spain reported over 900 deaths a day at the height of the outbreak.</p>
<p>The country of 47 million has had 27,650 deaths and 277,719 infections from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Spain is easing its strict lockdown measures that succeeded in slowing the spread of the virus but have also brought its economy to a halt.</p>
