<h1>Joe Starkey’s mailbag: Are the Steelers falling too far behind in AFC North arms race?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Princell Brockenbrough and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt dicicco, @DiciccoMatt:</strong> Should Steelers fans be worried having to face Jackson and Burrow twice a year for the next 10 years?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey</strong>: Concern is warranted, Mr. dicicco — and I’m not counting out Baker Mayfield just yet, either — but let’s see if Joe Burrow survives Cincinnati and if Lamar Jackson ever duplicates what he did this season.</p>
<p>I don’t think either prospect is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Burrow is an incredible passer. That much is obvious. He just threw 60 touchdown passes — and I’m not talking about Monday night. I’m talking about the season. Nobody ever did that before.</p>
<p>He can make every throw. He’s mobile enough. He’s plenty tough enough. What’s not to love? Now let’s see if the Bengals provide an environment in which Burrow can grow and thrive. Or if they ruin him. We’re talking about the Bengals, remember.</p>
<p>As for Jackson, let’s be honest: What makes him unique is the fact that he is one of the most spectacularly elusive runners in NFL history. As long as that remains the case, he will be a nightmare to defend.</p>
<p>This question, however, remains a fair one: How long can he survive as half running back, taking those kinds of hits?</p>
<p>What’s more, the Titans basically said they loaded the box and dared Jackson to beat them through the air, particularly outside the hash marks. He barely completed half his passes.</p>
<p>Jackson was every bit the league MVP this year. I just wonder what happens as the league punches back, literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, and more worrisome, the Steelers are extremely unsettled at the most important position on the field. That is true of the present and the future.</p>
<p>— Will Ben Roethlisberger recapture his form? That seems like no better than a 50/50 bet.</p>
<p>— Is Mason Rudolph good enough to win big with this defense? That seems like less than a 50/50 bet.</p>
<p>— Will the team sign a veteran QB to compete with Rudolph? It’s a fascinating prospect, because this could either be one of the worst places to go for playing time, or one of the best, depending on Roethlisberger’s status and durability.</p>
<p>— Will the Steelers draft a quarterback in the second round?&nbsp;I seriously doubt it, but it would be mighty interesting if they took <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/steelers/gm-report/jalen-hurts-steelers-think-twice" target="_blank">a chance on, say, Jalen Hurts</a>, wouldn’t it?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>KB, @kb871:</strong> Joe, you often complain about MLB being long and you can’t watch something over 3 hours. How are you enjoying this 5 hour football game?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> That game was longer than Trevor Lawrence’s hair, KB. It was longer than Hines Ward’s wait for the Hall of Fame. It was longer than … well, you get the idea. It was ridiculous. Combine the length of the game with the fact we waited 16 days for it to happen — and nearly two months since LSU’s last regular-season game — and I honestly didn’t care what happened by the end. Nor did I see it. I was down for the count, like most of the rest of America, I would imagine, by the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I’ll bet the ratings were excellent. It was a compelling matchup and totally entertaining. In other words, the kind of TV show that’s impossible to screw up, even it’s stretched over nine hours.</p>
<p><strong>Tim, @Tallest_Tim:</strong> Who was a better co-host, @ChrisMuellerPGH or @RonCookPG. Don’t worry, they won’t see what you say.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> They are equally compelling figures, Mr. Tallest. Equally brilliant and equally handsome. I wouldn’t dare differentiate between the two, other than to say Mullsy has a larger cranium.</p>
<p><strong>Doug Clark, @CraftonClarks:</strong> Why no penalties or fines for the players who were the primary perps?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> You’re talking about the Houston Asterisks scandal, Mr. Clark, and this is an interesting facet of it. I get Rob Manfred’s point that he needed players as cooperating witnesses (I’m assuming, perhaps mistakenly, that some were, besides Mike Fiers) and didn’t want to fight the MLBPA. He was also concerned, apparently, about identifying precisely who played what role in the cheating system.</p>
<p>That said, it seems wrong that the actual perpetrators should get off scot-free. They should at least be forced to give back the trophy and their rings.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Aschi, @michael_aschi:</strong> Joe, probably Ben’s last contract, so a very small window. Why sign for so much money, when cap space gives him a better chance at another ring?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Here’s what I always say to that, Mr. Aschi: I never blame anybody for getting all they can. Don’t all of us want the best possible deal?</p>
<p>And yes, absolutely, Ben prioritized his bank account over building the best possible team.</p>
<p>All of that can be true, and I don’t blame him.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p><strong>J B, @Jon_Brennan:</strong> Joe, the first grand slam of the tennis season is less than a week away in Melbourne, Australia, where the air index from the brush fires is still very dangerous. Do you think they should cancel it and if not, should the players boycott/protest?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I saw where a player had to forfeit on account of a coughing attack brought on by the air quality, JB. Yes, the tournament should be canceled. The images out of Australia are beyond horrific. The scope of the tragedy is almost unimaginable.</p>
<p><strong>KJPocket, @KJPocket:</strong> With Cowher being inducted into the Hall, having scattered his success over 3 qbs, what could 2004-2019 have brought with the Cowher/Ben combo?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Oh, I don’t know — a bunch of losses in AFC championship games, Mr. Pocket? You seem to be implying here (correct me if I’m wrong) that Cowher would have fared better with Ben than Mike Tomlin has. We’ll never know, but don’t forget, Cowher was pretty good at losing to New England, too.</p>
<p>Also, I’m gettin’ real sick of the “never had a franchise quarterback until Ben” excuse for Cowher. He was a very good coach. Joe Gibbs was great. Joe Gibbs won Super Bowls with Joe Theismann, Doug Williams and Mark Rypien. Bill Parcells won Super Bowls with Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler. Cowher was a home favorite in a bunch of AFC title games. He lost ’em all, except for the time he beat Jim Harbaugh’s Colts.</p>
<p><strong>JordanG, @GattzJordan:</strong> If all of The Fan hosts were given one run on a 4th &amp; goal from the 1 yard line, against an NFL defense, who would have the best shot of getting in the end zone?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> If the rule was “your head must break the plane,” Mullsy would be Marshawn Lynch.</p>
<p><strong>jase4668, @jase4668:</strong> Prefer a private luxury yacht vacation or your own island?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I’ll take the island, Mr. 4668, and I will build a whiffle ball stadium modeled after Forbes Field.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Hawthorne, @Hawthorneee:</strong> So with Cowher now in the Hall of Fame, that makes two Steelers coaches who have made it. If Tomlin were to retire today, does he get in? If not, what else does he need to accomplish?</p>
<p>Starkey: Funny you should ask, Chris.<a href="Starkey:%20https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2020/01/13/Pittsburgh-Steelers-coach-Mike-Tomlin-should-be-a-lock-for-Hall-of-Fame-Bill-Cowher-Chuck-Noll/stories/202001130114" target="_blank"> I just wrote an entire piece</a> on this subject. In fact, Paul Zeise and I wrote <a href="Zeise:%20https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/paul-zeise/2020/01/13/pro-football-hall-of-fame-centennial-class-bill-cowher-jimmy-johnson/stories/202001130097" target="_blank">the very same topic</a> on the very same day (again):</p>
<p><strong>Larry DeLong, @ldelong21:</strong> If Big Ben doesn’t get hurt, where do the Steelers end up this year?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> They might still be playing, Mr. DeLong. The AFC didn’t turn out to be all that daunting. Let’s say they finished 10-6 and went to Houston for a wild card game. I think they win. After that, all bets are off.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Reese, @BuStA607:</strong> With MLB handing out punishment to the Astros, should pitchers around the league want justice toward MLB for juicing their baseballs last year?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Great point, Dr. Reese! So much talk of legacies tarnished and jobs lost due to the Asterisks’ scandal. What about all these pitchers losing money on account of MLB’s obsession with home runs?</p>
<p>You win this week’s prize: a mention at the bottom of the mailbag!</p>
