<h1>What pregnant women need to know during COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pregnant with her fourth child, Danielle Stark thought she knew what her birth experience would look like, down to the bustling hospital room full of balloons and family members. But then came COVID-19. Instead, as her due date approached, Ms. Stark found herself researching the best apps for her baby girl’s virtual debut.</p>
<p>On the night of March 24,&nbsp;almost immediately after her daughter, Sadie, was born at West Penn Hospital,&nbsp;Ms. Stark FaceTimed with her three sons, who were up past bedtime with their grandfather. Right afterward, she switched to Snapchat, looping in her parents, three brothers and their wives.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“Probably within half an hour we went on that chat —&nbsp;all 10 of us were on there so they could meet her,” said Ms. Stark, of Baldwin. “It was sad that none of them could come in to visit us but the best part was the technology —&nbsp;it’s not like they’re missing it.”</p>
<p>Procedures for pregnant women have changed drastically over the past month, with only one visitor now allowed during the labor and delivery process and no visitors at prenatal appointments. With women reluctant to visit hospitals right now, some have reached out to the Midwife Center of Pittsburgh to ask if they can give birth there instead. Others are just trying to manage in an already anxious time.</p>
<p>“The majority of what I have been talking to patients about for the last week is this increased stress and anxiety,” said Stephanie Nicholas, medical director of the obstetrical patient experience for UPMC. “They just have all this anxiety and they don’t know what to do with it, and I don’t have all the answers for them.”</p>
<p>The good news for pregnant women is that they don’t seem to suffer from COVID-19 any more than the general population.</p>
<p>“Pregnancy does not seem to put you at increased risk for infection,” said Danielle Smith, an Ob/Gyn at Century Medical Associates, affiliated with West Penn Hospital. “There have been epidemics in the past that have put pregnant women at severe risk.”</p>
<p>Medical professionals face the challenge of giving women the best information they can —&nbsp;even as what the world knows about the virus is constantly changing.</p>
<p>Doctors had been advising patients that there was no evidence of “vertical transmission” from a pregnant mother to her baby. Then a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2763787?guestAccessKey=18924f51-c323-491e-8dbc-1a2187691e79&amp;utm_source=silverchair&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=article_alert-jamapediatrics&amp;utm_content=olf&amp;utm_term=032620" target="_blank">small study from China</a> released last week tested 33 infants born to mothers with COVID-19 and found that three did test positive in the days after birth.</p>
<p>The changes have affected all stages of pregnancy. Many couples have historically found out the sex of their baby at the anatomy ultrasound, done about halfway through the pregnancy. That, like all prenatal appointments, is now restricted to just pregnant women, without their partners —&nbsp;though women can livestream the ultrasound through video chat on their phones.</p>
<p>In-person appointments are also being staggered to reduce waiting room time. “We prefer them to not even sit down, just have them come straight in,” said Dr. Nicholas at UPMC.</p>
<p>Prenatal appointments where in-person contact isn’t absolutely necessary are being conducted through telemedicine, especially for low-risk patients. UPMC and AHN are starting to provide patients with blood pressure cuffs to use at home for telemedicine appointments.</p>
<p>Once it is time to enter the hospital to give birth, pregnant women —&nbsp;like all hospital patients —&nbsp;are screened upon arrival to make sure they aren’t showing symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>The limit on visitors</strong></p>
<p>To limit exposure for patients and medical staff, UPMC and Allegheny Health Network are limiting visitors for pregnant women to one person for the labor and delivery process.</p>
<p>“I was really nervous,” said Ms. Stark about entering a hospital to give birth. Once she got there and noticed the tight procedures, “They really made me feel comfortable,” she said. “I saw all the caution they were taking.”</p>
<p>In some areas of the country hardest hit by COVID-19, that caution has extended to banning all visitors while women are giving birth, including partners.</p>
<p>In New York, hospital systems reversed that policy after Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order permitting one visitor to attend a birth, provided that visitor does not have a fever.</p>
<p>A Change.org petition in Pennsylvania addressed to Gov. Tom Wolf titled “Please Help Mothers From Having to Birth Alone During COVID-19!” has more than 20,000 signatures. Wayne Memorial Hospital, located between Scranton and the New York state border, barred all visitors last week but <a href="https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/coronavirus/wayne-memorial-again-updates-maternity-visitor-policy-1.2612976" target="_blank">reversed its policy</a> days later.</p>
<p>“We are not planning to go under one person,” said Marcia Klein-Patel, chair of the Allegheny Health Network Women’s Institute, in reference to the number of visitors allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering earlier, leaving quickly</strong></p>
<p>The Midwife Center, the largest freestanding birth center in the country, has fielded a lot of calls from pregnant women who are anxious about entering a hospital and considering switching.&nbsp;“We’ve had a lot of increased interest over the last few weeks in our services,” said Emily McGahey. “That’s hard because we only have so much capacity.”</p>
<p>Thus far, the Midwife Center has been able to keep up with demand —&nbsp;and is taking the same measures as hospitals in terms of limiting visitors and offering online appointments where appropriate. The Midwife Center does allow a doula to attend a birth, along with one visitor. UPMC said it had situations where doulas have participated via FaceTime.</p>
<p>At Allegheny Health Network, some pregnant women are being given the option to deliver at 39 weeks, rather than 40 weeks, in order to give birth before an expected surge of COVID-19 patients could possibly strain hospitals. At UPMC, women who are good candidates had previously had that option at 39 weeks, said Dr. Nicholas, but more might choose to exercise it now.</p>
<p>AHN and UPMC are also making efforts to allow women medically able to be discharged after 24 hours to do so —&nbsp;an option that Ms. Stark chose. “It was like we were in and out,” she said.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>After women give birth, doctors are making every effort to do the postpartum check-in remotely as well, an option that may be offered even after the acute threat of COVID-19 passes.</p>
<p>“The postpartum period is a very crazy time,” Dr. Smith said. “Maneuvering out of the house with a newborn isn’t easy. I think that may come to be a thing that moms find useful.”</p>
<p>Doctors are urging new parents to follow social distancing guidelines as much as possible once the new baby is home —&nbsp;but also to accept help if it is needed.</p>
<p>New mothers need to balance their physical and emotional needs with the desire to quarantine, said Dr. Nicholas. “I just think that’s a tough place to put yourself, completely alone,” she said. “The sheer physical recovery requires some support and it can’t always just be her partner.”</p>
<p>Though the restrictions may sound severe, doctors are focused on striking the best possible balance to keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>“We are health care providers but we are also people and have families,” Dr. Smith said. “We have the same concerns that patients have. It sounds trite but I think it’s really true: we are all in this together.”</p>
