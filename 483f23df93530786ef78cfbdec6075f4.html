<h1>Peters Township, Knoch duos capture WPIAL tennis titles</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kat Wang and Marra Bruce have been through the rigors of the WPIAL and PIAA Class 3A doubles tournaments and have the gold medals to show for it.</p>
<p>That does not mean, however, that the Peters Township duo didn’t feel nervous heading into this year’s win-or-go-home WPIAL tournament at North Allegheny.</p>
<p>“It was definitely harder because there is only one opportunity,” Wang said. “But it was also kind of a blessing because we were also in singles and had to worry about if one of us makes it, so it was a double-edged sword in that way.”</p>
<p>After both failed to win the singles tournament two weeks ago, they refocused their sights on repeating as doubles champions. On Thursday they took the first step toward a second consecutive state title, as well as qualifying for the PIAA Class 3A tournament, by winning the WPIAL with a 6-0, 6-2 victory over Mt. Lebanon’s Lauren Masteller and Lily Bosch.</p>
<p>“Last year we had no pressure because I was just a freshman, she was just a sophomore and this year, because we had won WPIALs and states, we had double the pressure,” Bruce said. “Everyone was after us, they wanted to beat us and tear us down, but we played really well and we just got back on top.”</p>
<p>Because of COVID-19 restrictions, only the district champion advances into the PIAA tournament, which opens with a regional match against the City League, District 9 or District 10 champion Nov. 4 at a site and time to be determined.</p>
<p>For the past several years, the WPIAL had three slots in the 16-team field at Hershey Racquet Club, This year, only the semifinals and finals will be played at the storied venue.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s going to be that big of a deal [playing a prelim before Hershey] because we did that for team finals last year and played one here,” Bruce said.</p>
<p>Wang and Bruce weren’t the only repeat champions Thursday. Knoch sophomore Ally Bauer won her second consecutive Class 2A title — albeit with a new partner — as she teamed with her sister Brooke, a senior, for a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Nicole Kempton and Haley Spitznagel of South Park.</p>
<p>They will play the District 6 champions, Olivia Ratchford and Coco Markovich of Central Cambria, on Nov. 4.</p>
<p>“It’s so cool,” Ally Bauer said. “It’s so great to do it with someone I’m so close with.”</p>
<p>Brooke Bauer played singles last year and was the runner-up to teammate Laura Greb. But instead of competing in the section singles tournament this year, she devoted herself to winning a WPIAL doubles title with her sister.</p>
<p>“Laura’s a great player and she’s on my team and both of us taking the top last year, [it] was awesome,” Brooke Bauer said. “But it just has a different feel, especially winning with my sister.”</p>
