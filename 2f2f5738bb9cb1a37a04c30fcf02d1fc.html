<h1>Duquesne staying level through bumps and bruises of program-building</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Keith Dambrot is trying to build something at Duquesne.</p>
<p>The Dukes have improved their record every year under Dambrot, from 16 wins in 2017-18 to 19 wins last season. This year, Duquesne sits at 18 wins with four regular season games remaining and at least one A10 tournament game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem, as Dambrot has expressed several times throughout the season, is that program-building is a slow process.</p>
<p>Along the way come growing pains and missed opportunities. Twice this season, on the road against Rhode Island in January and at Dayton this past Sunday, the Dukes have led at halftime against the top two teams in the conference, only to lose by double digits. They’ve also lost games to teams they probably should have beaten along the way, like Massachusetts and George Washington.</p>
<p>In the wake of the loss to the Flyers, though, Dambrot says his players have rebounded well and kept high spirits.</p>
<p>“I don’t really think players hang on to things long. I think coaches do and administrators do,” Dambrot said Tuesday. “But I think the kids nowadays, they play so much AAU and win, lose, win, win, lose, lose that I don’t really think that it fazes them much in the long term. I think the grind of the year does, but I don’t think the actual wins and losses really do. I think that’s probably the good thing about young people is they have their raincoat on, and the water just splashes off.”</p>
<p>With that, Dambrot has taken measures to try to keep his players fresh physically.</p>
<p>Duquesne’s practice lengths vary based on how Dambrot feels his team is feeling. He has talked extensively about his in-game rotations, saying he feels substituting more frequently gives the Dukes a better chance of success.</p>
<p>The flip side of that, though, is that when it comes down to it, Duquesne has to play the players it can trust. Certain guys have the ability to be offensive threats and defensively reliable at this stage of their development. Others aren’t there yet.</p>
<p>That, too, is part of program building. Dayton, for example, has nine guys who average at least 8.5 minutes per game. The lowest scorer of that group has 42 points this season. The Dukes largely have a seven-man rotation, with those seven averaging 20 minutes per game or more. A few others get intermittent playing time, and while they certainly have their uses, the statistical production isn’t quite where they’d like it to be.</p>
<p>Dambrot would like his minutes to be more evenly spread out to prevent wear and tear on Duquesne’s horses throughout the season.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s so much mental for us. I think it’s more physical than mental,” Dambrot said. “Part of our second-half issues are physical. Just not enough substitutions, not enough depth. Not probably physically mature yet, everybody. It think that’s part of it.”</p>
<p>The positive is that the Dukes have made substantial progress under Dambrot. If they win just one more game this season, they’ll have 19 wins for the second consecutive year. That number is somewhat of an arbitrary cut off, but Duquesne hasn’t won 19 games in two straight seasons in 48 years.</p>
<p>The next step is to parlay that improvement into tangible results: conference championships, NIT bids, NCAA tournament bids, etc., and to compete for those levels year-in and year-out.</p>
<p>Even the top programs struggle with that, though, and that worries Dambrot a bit. Programs like Davidson and VCU have been the class of the A10 for years. This year, those two programs are struggling to gain traction and sit squarely in the middle of the pack in the conference standings.</p>
<p>“The scary thing about it is we’re trying to build a program here,” Dambrot said.&nbsp;“VCU’s 7-7 and Davidson’s 8-6. Do you know how long those programs have been good? Saint Louis is another good example. Like, we’re trying to get above that, and they’re struggling to get above that. [Davidson coach Bob McKillop]’s been there for over 30 years and Saint Louis has had tradition of huge basketball. We’ve got to get frustrated, too. Don’t get me wrong, we have high expectations, but that’s what you fight.”</p>
