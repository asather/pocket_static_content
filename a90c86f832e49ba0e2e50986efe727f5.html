<h1>Port Authority to offer extra light rail service for Sunday's Steelers game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority will add light rail trains Sunday for the Pittsburgh Steelers 1 p.m. game with the Philadelphia Eagles, the first game a limited number of fans will be allowed to attend.</p>
<p>Although state guidelines will allow only 5,500 fans, the authority said it will add vehicles to make sure everyone can get to the game. The trains will maintain their limited capacity of 25 riders per car due to the COVID-19 pandemic and riders will be required to wear masks.</p>
<p>Fans are reminded to allow additional time because trains that reach their passenger limit will not pick up additional riders.</p>
<p>Bus service will follow the regular Sunday schedule.</p>
<p>After the game, fans should use the Allegheny Station on Allegheny Avenue, near Carnegie Science Center. The North Side Station at the West General Robinson Street will be closed from 1 p.m. until one hour after the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authority has routine maintenance scheduled on its Red Line from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.&nbsp; Saturday but Sunday work has been postponed.</p>
