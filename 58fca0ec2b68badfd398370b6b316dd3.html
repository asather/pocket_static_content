<h1>Pirates' Derek Shelton talks video review, Josh Bell and building a successful organization</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>You can take the man away from baseball, but you can’t take baseball away from the man.</p>
<p>That’s the case for Derek Shelton, at least, who has had the regular season start to his career as Pirates manager delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He’s still watching baseball, though.</p>
<p>Namely, he’s diving into the minutiae in regards to his players, watching specific parts of his new players’ games to see what they do well and where improvements can be made.</p>
<p>“It keeps me engaged in baseball, watching different things,” Shelton said Wednesday on his weekly radio appearance with Post-Gazette columnists Ron Cook and Joe Starkey on 93.7 The Fan. “And I think we can get a little more micro with what we’re watching. You can watch guys fielding ground balls to their left or right or certain advantage counts of hitters. You can really watch it in finite detail, because we have time to do that right now. That kind of thing that in a previous time would have been minutiae. Now it’s exciting, because you’re looking at things and watching baseball.”</p>
<p>One of those players he’s watched, presumably, is Josh Bell. Shelton was asked specifically about his first baseman and the impressions he’s gotten from him in his short time in Pittsburgh, and he complimented the slugger’s ability to hit the ball and hit it far. Shelton acknowledged that Bell had some times of struggle mixed in with his huge success last season, but he took responsibility for making sure those down times aren’t as frequent in the future.</p>
<p>“I know there were different things last year where he had really good months and then he struggled for a bit, and I think that’s going to be on me and our group to make sure that we maximize his ability to be on the field,” Shelton said. “But [I’m] really excited that he’s a guy that’s in the middle of our lineup. Exciting kid to be around. If you spend any time talking to him, you understand why people gravitate toward him, not only as a baseball player, but as a human being.”</p>
<p>Beyond the individual player perspective, though, Shelton’s interview shined some light on what he brings to the table in terms of making the Pirates a successful organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shelton spent seven seasons (2010-16) as the Tampa Bay Rays’ hitting coach. Though they have experienced some down years along the way, the Rays have become a sort of gold standard for small market teams who want to compete with the big boys in the MLB without the ability to spend money like the big boys.</p>
<p>Pirates fans know that struggle all too well themselves. But Shelton learned some tips and tricks with the Rays, and he believes he understands what makes the Rays so successful, despite their spending limits.</p>
<p>“I think what was really special about my time there was the synergy between the front office and the coaching staff and the ability on both sides to ask questions,” Shelton said. “It’s something that [Pirates general manager Ben Cherington] and I have talked about a ton and we’re really trying to do with our group here. We’re trying to make sure that our baseball ops guys ask our coaches questions and our coaches ask our baseball ops, and everything’s on the table, and we have to be willing to learn, and we have to be willing to listen.</p>
<p>“And I think that’s something that [the Rays] started to do really well ... and I think you’re seeing other teams trying to model off that and you really have to make sure that your managers and your coaches and your baseball ops people have an open mind to do that. It was at the forefront of how we built our staff here.”</p>
<p>Another aspect of that is player development, which the Rays have done extremely well in past years, cycling them back into the playoffs in 2019 with a very young, inexpensive, talented roster.</p>
<p>Shelton understands the farm system is important, and that’s even more true for teams in small markets. It’s all part of building a winning formula, which Shelton experienced with the Rays and now hopes to help cultivate with the Pirates.</p>
<p>“I know [Cherington] has talked about coming in and identifying and acquiring and developing and deploying the group among us with the Pirates, but it’s important,” Shelton said. “If you’re in a smaller market, you have to have the ability to develop and continue to utilize your farm system, and I think that’s something the Rays have done, and I think it’s something the Pirates are going to do. And it’s why they sustain, because they make good decisions, and then they challenge those decisions constantly, and I think good organizations do that.”</p>
