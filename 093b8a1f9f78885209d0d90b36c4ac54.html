<h1>Will baseball teams stop trying to steal signs? One Pirate doesn’t think so</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There was plenty of talk around PiratesFest on Saturday about the Astros’ sign-stealing scandal. Colin Moran and Joe Musgrove spoke on it, which was predictable because they played in Houston. The same for Jameson Taillon, who's from there, and serves as the Pirates’ representative for the MLBPA.</p>
<p>But one of the more interesting discussions involved Jacob Stallings, who said that he didn’t think the punishment handed out by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred would do enough to discourage future teams from trying to use technology to steal signs.</p>
<p>“That’s a good question,” Stallings said. “Personally, no, I don’t. We’ll see, I guess.”</p>
<p>Why does Stallings feel that way?</p>
<p>“They’re still World Series champions,” Stallings said. “I don’t have all the specifics that the Commissioner’s Office has. But if you win a World Series, was it worth it in the end?”</p>
<p>Stallings had a fairly logical reason for feeling that way. Over the course of baseball — and human — history, teams (and people) have always done whatever they could to seek an edge.</p>
<p>Multiple times last season, Stallings said he noticed opposing teams’ broadcasts making fun of the Pirates for using elaborate sign sequences with nobody on base.</p>
<p>“Now everybody kinda knows why,” Stallings said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Stallings said that multiple times last season that he got crossed up because the Pirates had so many different sets of signs and would basically have to guess what pitch was coming.</p>
<p>It’s an unfortunate byproduct of an environment where, Stallings said, the Pirates were “paranoid” that home teams were up to something trying to steal signs.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you this, there were multiple times last year where I forgot what sign sequence we were on because we were switching it every inning,” Stallings said. “With no mound visits, that become a problem. At times I might’ve been guessing what pitch they were throwing. Like I said, we were paranoid about it. I would anticipate that continuing to be the case.”</p>
