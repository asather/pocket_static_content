<h1>Boys basketball rankings: Knoch moves to No. 1 in WPIAL Class 4A</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Knock, knock.</p>
<p>Who’s there?</p>
<p>Knoch.</p>
<p>Knoch who?</p>
<p>Knoch, the new No. 1 team in WPIAL Class 4A boys basketball.</p>
<p>The Knoch Knights have moved up to the top spot in this week’s Post-Gazette rankings. Knoch was No. 2 last week, but No. 1 Quaker Valley dropped two consecutive section games to Blackhawk and Ambridge, allowing the Knights to take over the No. 1 position.</p>
<p>Knoch is 11-1 and in first place in Class 4A Section 1 with a 5-0 mark. The Knights have been impressive offensively, averaging 74.9 points, good for fourth-best in the WPIAL. Only North Catholic (78.9), Our Lady of the Sacred Heart (75.8) and Trinity (75.5) average more points.</p>
<p>And when it comes to scoring, Knoch has a Big Three. Knoch boasts three players who are in the top 60 in scoring in the entire WPIAL. In the most recent Post-Gazette statistics, Ryan Lang was averaging 19 points a game, Scott Fraser 17.6 and Jared Schrecengost 17.</p>
<p>Knoch is the fourth different team that has been ranked No. 1 in Class 4A this season. New Castle, Quaker Valley and Highlands all spent some time at No. 1 this season. Knoch knocked Highlands out of the top spot after beating the Rams, 74-67, on Jan. 7. Knoch plays at Highlands Jan. 28.</p>
<p>Knoch has a chance to win only its second section title outright (without a tie) since 1990. The other was in 2003.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the rankings, Class 4A seems a little strange. Not because Knoch is No. 1, but because New Castle is nowhere to be found. The Red Hurricanes are 8-5 and dropped out of the top five. It’s hard to remember the last time New Castle wasn’t ranked.</p>
