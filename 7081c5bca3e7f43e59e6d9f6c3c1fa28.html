<h1>Gene Collier: Steelers, Broncos took turns producing comedy of errors</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Perhaps you favored some kind of linear narrative to this Steelers season, something that starts like, oh, say, Rusty Roethlisberger, having knocked away much of the iron oxide from his game last Monday night in a nationally televised victory, helps Mike Tomlin’s team smooth out a way forward in the home opener against the Broncos.</p>
<p>Maybe not a polished performance in Game 2 of a scheduled 16, but at least a smartly applied coat of primer to ready the 2020 Steelers offense for a higher gloss.</p>
<p>Well, hold your tickets.</p>
<p>For their first turn with the football Sunday, the Steelers ran into each on the punt return, fumbled on the first play from scrimmage, ran an eight-yard out pattern on 3rd-and-10, and on their signal, a three-plus hour Blunderfest had ignition.</p>
<p>“We understand,” Mike Tomlin said once the Broncos simply could no longer get out of their own way, “that early in the season, we’re not going to be perfect.”</p>
<p>So now we understand it, as well. Also, they’re not going to be anywhere close. Fortunately, this was only Aug. 20, and often that third preseason game turns into a shaggy dress rehearsal by the Future Former Players Association, and ...</p>
<p>Oh wait.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was real, and anyone who saw it knows in their heart of hearts, their spleen of spleens, that Tomlin’s team improved to 2-0 in September football only because, for every boneheaded mistake made by the home team, there was an eager nearby Bronco to say, “Hold my beer.”</p>
<p>Denver dropped an interception in the end zone (the Steelers scored a touchdown two plays later), dropped a punt snap in the other end zone (the Steelers scored a safety two seconds later), allowed seven sacks, dropped about 63 passes, one of which got tipped for a Joe Haden interception, attempted a ridiculous 58-yard field goal (nope), and left rookie wideout K.J. Hamler of Penn State waving in frustration in the Steelers end zone as he was open for a TD and no closer to a defender than he was to Sewickley.</p>
<p>The Denver strategy appeared to be to not get ahead, perhaps because six times in the long head coaching career of Vic Fangio (17 games before Sunday), the Broncos had blown leads in the final 30 seconds. So they avoided their nightmare scenario groove by getting behind and staying there, but they still needed one final, inexplicable brain cramp by running back Melvin Gordon on fourth-and-2 at the Pittsburgh 15 on their last possession to drop to 0-2.</p>
<p>A short 45 feet from the winning touchdown with 1:55 to play, backup quarterback Jeff Driskel dropped to pass with Gordon in the backfield to protect him. Steelers safety Terrell Edmunds, fresh from sustaining this very drive by himself with a penalty on the previous third-and-11, approached from the boundary as part of yet another Pittsburgh blitz package, which Gordon interpreted as his signal to go out for a pass. When he did that, Edmunds flattened Driskel — game, set, match. Gordon could have saved everybody a few steps by just tackling Driskel himself.</p>
<p>“I’ve rushed a few times,” Edmunds noted casually to his Zoom audience. “When I came down I thought, ‘If I’m open I’ve got to make the play.’ It was fourth down. Everyone was like, ‘We’re ready. We love the game. Let’s go out and make a play.’”</p>
<p>Edmunds wouldn’t say whether he’d normally blitz in that situation and advised that we ask Tomlin about it because Edmunds didn’t want to give anything away, game plan-wise. I’m sure Mike will tell us (snort!).</p>
<p>In any case, Edmunds got credited with the seventh sack of the afternoon, which put Keith Butler’s defense on pace for 80, 11 more than the team record, 26 more than the 54 it had to lead the league last year, 28 more than it had to lead the league the year before, etc. They’re pretty good at it. Pittsburgh has had at least one sack in 59 consecutive games. The next longest such streak is 20 (Dallas).</p>
<p>Sure, it might have been a long day for Drew Lock at quarterback for Denver, which he avoided by injuring his shoulder on the second possession, but the feeling inside Heinz Field (or at least as I watched Heinz Field on TV from one of the upstairs bedrooms) was that the Steelers had narrowly side-stepped a hideous home loss to a bad team with a backup quarterback.</p>
<p>That was probably because six of the 10 Pittsburgh penalties resulted in a Denver first down, or because the Pittsburgh offense went 2 for 12 on third down, or because Rusty Roethlisberger threw an atrocious interception among several bad throws, or because Devin Bush and Vince Williams were both beaten for touchdowns, or because their special teams nullified a Diontae Johnson touchdown with an illegal block on a punt return, or because the first Denver points got triggered by a terrible punt from Dustin Colquitt.</p>
<p>Other than that, they were crisp. Smooth. All primer-ed up for who knows what.</p>
