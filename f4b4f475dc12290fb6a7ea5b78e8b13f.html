<h1>Talks restarted as MLB, union make 'significant progress'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em><strong>This is a developing story and will be updated:</strong></em></p>
<p>Baseball is showing signs of life for the first time in weeks.</p>
<p>According to multiple national reports, Major League Baseball has sent a new proposal to the MLB Players Association — and it appears this one will be different than the previous three that were rejected, especially since MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and MLB executive director Tony Clark reportedly met face-to-face in Arizona twice over the past two days, restarting talks after a contentious couple of days.</p>
<p>“No deal is done,” ESPN’s Jeff Passan wrote on Twitter. “But with Rob Manfred and Tony Clark having met, this is seen as significant progress considering where the parties were 48 hours ago.”</p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, MLB Network Insider Jon Heyman indicated talks were pretty far along.</p>
<p>"The two sides are closing in on an agreement to play the 2020 season.” Heyman tweeted.</p>
<p>While plenty of the subsequent leakage seemed to temper that enthusiasm, Manfred and Clark talking, as Passan said, is pretty big.&nbsp;If the MLBPA rejects this most recent agreement, it would be a pretty big surprise.</p>
<p>According to one source, the proposal MLB made to players is for a minimum of 60 games and includes full prorated salaries.&nbsp;And according to another national writer, Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, the proposal includes exactly 60 games in 70 days starting July 19 or 20.&nbsp;Players would receive full prorated salaries, there would be expanded playoffs in 2020 and 2021 and the MLBPA would also waive its right to the potential filing of a grievance.</p>
<p>Rosenthal said he expected the players union to counter and attempt to bump the game total into the mid-60s, a logical move considering the owners' last offer.&nbsp;That was for a total of $1.5 billion in salaries ... or the same as players would receive over 60 games at full pro rata, meaning the possibility of a deal is there, but it's not quite done yet.</p>
<p>Manfred released a statement Wednesday saying he and Clark “left the meeting with a jointly developed framework that we agreed could form the basis of an agreement.”</p>
<p>Wednesday’s developments comes at a key time for the sport, as talks between the league and the MLBPA had stalled, with the rhetoric growing decidedly worse amid the possibility there could be no baseball in 2020.</p>
<p>The union over the weekend decided to halt discussions and asked Manfred to tell players “when and where” a season would start, seemingly accepting that it could be a truncated one.nd</p>
<p>When the ball was placed in his court, Manfred did not exercise his authority to determine the length of the 2020 season. Instead, he said <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/15/Commissioner-Rob-Manfred-losing-confidence-MLB-potential-return/stories/202006150097" target="_blank">he had lost confidence</a> that baseball might return in 2020, a weird assertion that was seemingly a ploy to bring players back to the bargaining table.</p>
<p>Manfred also expressed concern over the lack of communication and the possibility that the MLBPA could file a grievance should the commissioner implement a season of his choosing.</p>
<p>Manfred’s move, as you might expect, turned the baseball world upside down and the entire thing into an even bigger circus, with the sport being heavily criticized for the inability of very rich people to find common ground.</p>
<p>Talks thus far toward a 2020 season had been largely unproductive, with players wanting full prorated salaries and owners trying to keep player salaries around 30%, despite issuing three different proposals.</p>
<p>But as they spoke for the first time since June 7, and with the sport in dire need of a solution, Manfred and Clark may have found one, a season in the 60- or 70-game range and an agreement that would allow for a larger pool of money in the postseason.</p>
<p><strong>Helping minor leaguers</strong></p>
<p>The Major League Baseball Players Trust on Wednesday announced a $1 million donation to support minor leaguers who won’t have a season in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Some major league teams are paying their minor leaguers despite the fact that there almost assuredly won’t be a season, while the Pirates are paying theirs through June.</p>
<p>“Major League Baseball players are proud to support our fellow players in minor league baseball,” said Cardinals pitcher Andrew Miller, who serves as a Players Trust trustee. “These players have found themselves hit hard as a result of the pandemic and are unable to play the game we all love. The game is also their livelihood and there is no doubt the financial impact has been challenging. We hope to help them navigate these difficult times.”</p>
