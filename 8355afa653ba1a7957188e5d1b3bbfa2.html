<h1>Penn State's Tariq Castro-Fields hopes to bounce back from 'frustrating' junior year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There’s a belief in college football that elite programs don’t rebuild. Instead of repairing, they reload.</p>
<p>Penn State has tallied 11 wins in three of the past four seasons and perhaps is on the cusp of becoming one of those schools like Big Ten division rival Ohio State. Cornerback Tariq Castro-Fields’ senior season could go a long way toward getting there.</p>
<p>The departure of John Reid to the NFL leaves a bit of a hole in the Penn State defensive backfield.&nbsp;Castro-Fields is a leading candidate to fill the black shoes left behind when the Houston Texans drafted Reid in April.</p>
<p>“I don’t really feel pressure because that’s my role, and I’m just going to capitalize off it,” Castro-Fields said recently. “I think I am ready for it. I really know the defense, I’m able to play the field and the boundary, and I think, regardless of whoever guards who, you have trust in the rest of the corners. We need everyone to kind of step up and be the top corners.”</p>
<p>The Penn State secondary was gashed at times last season and allowed 251.5 passing yards per game, the 32nd-worst mark in the country.</p>
<p>Castro-Fields, however, showed the potential to be a star with two interceptions, 10 passes defended and 52 tackles. But an undisclosed injury slowed his progress. Defensive recruiting coordinator and cornerbacks coach Terry Smith noticed a difference in Castro-Fields’ performance as the year went on.</p>
<p>“From that injury on, he was a different player,” Smith said. “He wasn’t as confident, he wasn’t as sure of himself, and because of the injury — not to make an excuse. He knows and recognizes it. We’ve talked about it.”</p>
<p>Castro-Fields confirmed the ailment set him back some.</p>
<p>“It was a frustrating process, but the coaches had a plan for me, and I just tried to do the best I could,” Castro-Fields said .” Whatever they asked me to do, wherever my role was for the team, I wanted to do it. I wanted to do it to the best of my ability. It was kind of frustrating.”</p>
<p>Smith doesn’t want the prior adversity to keep Castro-Fields from missing the mark.</p>
<p>“We need a lockdown corner that can handle the best receiver of whoever our opponent is,” Smith said. “We expect Tariq to be that guy. His season last year was almost like two different seasons. In the first half of the season, he came out the gate looking like a first-round draft pick.”</p>
<p>Castro-Fields knows the confidence that Smith has in him. He’s looking forward to showing for a full season as a senior.</p>
<p>“I was at my best when I was playing with a lot of confidence and being physical,” Castro-Fields said. “I thought I knew the defense well, which allowed me to play fast. My confidence was something that I was showing myself what I can do each game, and it helped.”</p>
