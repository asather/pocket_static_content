<h1>Mars Area school board names interim primary center principal </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Mars Area school board Tuesday appointed Adam Kostewicz as interim principal of the primary center.</p>
<p>Mr. Kostewicz will remain principal of the Centennial School and will be paid a stipend of $5,000 to run both buildings until June 30.</p>
<p>Elizabeth McMahon, Mars Area assistant superintendent, has also been running the primary center, which houses kindergarten and first grade. She will be acting superintendent upon expiration of Wesley Shipley’s contract in June.</p>
<p>Ms. McMahon said the district posted the interim principal position and had two applicants from outside the district.</p>
<p>“Someone new coming in isn’t going to help me right now. I would rather have someone who is invested in us and what we do,” she said. “It’s a smoother transition than bringing in someone who doesn’t know the school or the students.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kostewicz was principal of the primary center before being moved to Centennial, which houses fifth and sixth grades.</p>
<p>“We’ve already done it once. Let’s do it again,” he told board members.</p>
<p>In other business, the board approved the 2020-21 calendar. The first day for students is Aug. 26, and the last day is June 3. There will be one snow makeup day built into the calendar; the remaining snow days, if needed, will be flexible instruction days, where students work from home on their district-issued computers.</p>
<p>The board also approved new National Honor Societies for German, Spanish and French.</p>
