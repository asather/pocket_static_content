<h1>Pa. won't use nursing homes for COVID-19 overflow; Mass. changes plans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Massachusetts has abandoned a plan to use active nursing homes as a source of relief for hospitals overwhelmed by surges of COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine said last week that she was discussing the idea of using entire long-term care facilities for people in recovery. At the time, Massachusetts was moving forward on a proposal to use nursing homes as a way to increase surge capacity and separate COVID-19 clusters in elder-care facilities. But the idea hit&nbsp;snags immediately, with dozens of patients who were about to be moved testing positive for the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health clarified on Tuesday that it was not discussing using nursing homes like Massachusetts. The department “has been working on a number of options in regard to alternative care sites, which includes using ambulatory surgical facilities,” the statement said. “We have not had discussions about repurposing nursing homes, and that would not be a conversation in Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>The DOH statement went on to say, “Individuals who are in congregate care settings, such as nursing homes, and the workers taking care of them, are among those prioritized by the department and many testing locations.”</p>
<p>A mass distribution of personal protective equipment to long-term care facilities took place on April 3, the statement said, adding that they are in constant communication with long-term care facilities.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services said this week that it had scrapped plans to convert nursing homes for surge capacity, but now may use vacant nursing homes for that purpose. State health officials are also deploying mobile testing units and seeking to separate nursing home residents who have tested positive or negative within existing facilities.</p>
<p>"The commonwealth is aggressively pursuing options to expand health-care capacity in the state in light of the COVID-19 public health emergency. One option we pursued was the use of skilled nursing facilities, but as additional testing revealed that COVID-19 had spread in these facilities, we reevaluated this approach and are now seeking to use vacant nursing homes.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania health officials are considering many options, said Anne Henry, senior vice president and chief of government affairs for LeadingAge PA,&nbsp;a statewide association representing nonprofit providers of services for older adults.</p>
<p>“We have some LeadingAge PA members interested in either utilizing existing spaces within their nursing home or community for COVID+ units,” she said Tuesday. “We also have some members exploring whether they can come together with other nursing homes and/or hospitals to quickly set up a COVID+ building. We are working with the Department of Health to obtain guidance, but we also understand they are waiting on some clarifications from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention they expect this week.</p>
<p>Ms. Henry added: “The science is changing so quickly that they don’t want to issue something and then have to pull it back. Other barriers that were discussed are staffing, payment for services, immunity from liability and lack of [personal protective equipment].”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Department of Health interim guidelines, issued March 18 for nursing care facilities, already include protecting and testing both patients and staff, while saying facilities “must continue to accept new admissions and receive readmissions for current residents who have been discharged from the hospital who are stable, to alleviate the increasing burden in acute-care settings. This may include stable patients who have had the COVID-19 virus.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dedicated-nursing-facility-letter/download" target="_blank">Massachusetts&nbsp;Gov. Charlie Baker had announced on March 27</a> that his administration’s COVID-19 Response Command Center was working with long-term care facilities to establish dedicated skilled nursing facilities for COVID-19 patients “who are stable but still need medical care,” thus freeing up intensive care units and hospital space.</p>
<p>The move was made with approval from the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. To expedite the initiative, the Department of Public Health in Massachusetts issued an order waiving certain MassHealth regulations regarding the transfers and discharge of residents, for “the limited purpose” of safely clearing a facility for COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>The first facility was SALMON Health and Retirement’s Beaumont Rehabilitation and Skilled Nursing Center in Worcester, which freed 300 nursing facility beds in central Massachusetts. Beaumont was ready to receive new patients on April 6, but that plan hit a snag on April 2. Several patients about to be transferred that day to other SALMON facilities tested positive for COVID-19 and were kept in Worchester.</p>
<p>“The residents on that floor who did not test positive were transferred to our sister facilities, excepting one resident who was moved to a facility out of the SALMON Health and Retirement network,” said a company statement.</p>
<p>A second nursing home in Massachusetts, AdviniaCare at Wilmington, was forced to delay plans to be repurposed. The facility has had seven deaths as 77 of the home's 91 residents have been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, according to NBC Boston. Each of the patients had been receiving end-of-life care.</p>
<p>“As COVID-19 continues to impact nursing homes across Massachusetts, we are encouraging the creation of COVID-19 positive and negative wings to ensure safe care for all residents, and to support adherence to infection control measures,” the Health and Human Services statement said.</p>
<p>An unwanted spotlight on the handling of nursing home cases focused on Holyoke (Mass.) Soldiers' Home, where 38 residents have died since March, including 32 who tested positive for COVID-19, according to a report Monday by WWLP-TV in Springfield, Mass..</p>
<p>The National Guard was called in to quarantine patients and increase nursing staff to slow the spread of the virus. But with the death toll increasing, prosecutors have launched an investigation separate from the state attorney general’s office.</p>
<p>The state has set up mobile testing units, with support from the National Guard, that has tested 3,700 long-term care residents at 221 facilities.</p>
<p>“We will continue to work at stemming the tide of this pandemic in the community and in the state’s nursing homes, and will continue to secure vacant nursing homes, as well as field hospitals, to care for COVID-19 patients,” the statement said.</p>
<p>In offering background on why nursing homes were considered, it was noted that “states such as New York were forced to impose a mandate on skilled nursing facilities to take COVID-19 patients from hospitals. Massachusetts is working to create sufficient capacity with COVID designated sites – including skilled nursing facilities — to avoid such drastic measures.”</p>
<p>When Matt Salmon, CEO of SALMON Health and Retirement, announced on Facebook that his Beaumont facility would be transferring residents to other facilities, comments ran the gamut from approval to betrayal.</p>
<p>Lisa Malloy wrote: “Thank you for your innovative thinking in the care of our seniors. Containing the disease in one building is a brilliant idea. The disruption for your residents is sad but unfortunately necessary for their protection.”</p>
<p>Janet Tuiskula wrote that her family is “so worried” about her father, a dementia patient at Beaumont.</p>
<p>“He needs his home and friends there. He trusts the staff. This move will confuse him. Will he be able to adjust to a total change in everything he knows? … This move is not a commitment to the community that Beaumont has built.”</p>
<p>CDC recommendations for long-term care residents and staffers have already changed lives in facilities nationwide. Besides barring visitors, the CDC has recommended canceling communal dining and activities, and that facilities “create a plan for cohorting residents with symptoms of respiratory infection, including dedicating [health care practitioners] to work only on affected units.”</p>
<p>The recommendations came after a CDC study of Washington, which was among the first states to report a deadly outbreak of COVID-19 at a long-term senior care facility. The CDC studied the incubator case, where there were 23 deaths among 81 residents ages 54-100, 34 staff members and 14 visitors.</p>
<p>Last week, the curve began to flatten for Washington, reportedly due to aggressive social distancing and separating non-COVID-19 patients from the hospital system. A 250-bed field hospital assembled by the Army in an events center next to Seattle's baseball stadium was declared unnecessary. Gov. Jay Inslee said.</p>
<p>“We haven't beat this virus yet, and until we do, it has the potential to spread rapidly if we don't continue the measures we've put in place."</p>
