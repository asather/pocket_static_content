<h1>What the Pirates are saying about the Astros cheating scandal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jameson Taillon is the Pirates’ union representative and a Houston resident, meaning he heard all offseason about Major League Baseball’s investigation into the Houston Astros’ use of technology to steal signs. He heard about it on the radio. He heard about it at Whole Foods.</p>
<p>“It’s gotten baseball some press, that's for sure,” Taillon said.</p>
<p>At PiratesFest on Saturday, players expressed confidence that the punishments levied and protocols instituted would eradicate cheating on this scale. Good thing, too, considering the way some talked about it.</p>
<p>“I know the overall conversation we’ve had, at least with our team, is if you had to choose between cheating and steroids and cheating with knowing what pitches are coming for half the games of the year, I think that cheating with knowing what’s coming in half the games of the year is worse,” first baseman Josh Bell said.</p>
<p>The Astros, the league’s investigations found, used center-field camera feeds on a television near the dugout to decode opposing catchers’ signs, then banged on a trash can to signal the upcoming pitch to the batter. Astros manager A.J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow were suspended and subsequently fired. Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora, Houston’s bench coach in 2017 and an integral supporter of the scheme, lost his job. So did New York Mets manager Carlos Beltran, who spent 2017, the final season of his 20-year playing career, with the Astros. MLB deemed him to be heavily involved in the scheme, and the Mets, who hired him this offseason, fired him before he managed a game.</p>
<p>“Whatever you guys see in the reports and whatever’s been put out, that’s pretty much the extent of what I knew, even more so, some stuff I had no idea was going on, if it was going on,” said Joe Musgrove, who was with the Astros in 2017.</p>
<p>Asked how he felt as a pitcher to know that such activities were transpiring, Musgrove said, “I don’t know, man. I mean, I was in my first year, I was a rookie [it was Musgrove’s second season in the majors]. I was kind of just keeping my mouth shut and keeping to myself, trying to learn from the guys I was around.”</p>
<p>Musgrove spent part of that year in the bullpen. The Astros promoted Colin Moran in late July 2017 in Baltimore. He played two games and fouled a ball off his face in the second one. He didn't return to the majors until September and played in five games, all on the road.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t really around it much. I didn’t really have much knowledge,” Moran said. “I just kind of … most of the stuff from the commissioner’s report was kind of … what the commissioner came out with, I thought, kind of spoke for itself.”</p>
<p>The commissioner’s report says “[W]itnesses made clear that everyone proximate to the Astros’ dugout presumptively heard or saw the banging.” Moran, who said he was not one of the 23 current and former Astros players interviewed, demurred.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t there, no,” he said. “I think what’s in the commissioner’s report is probably what can speak for itself.”</p>
<p>MLB granted immunity to the players in order to receive candid accounts of what happened. It also did so, according to the Wall Street Journal, because Luhnow did not adequately inform players or coaches of memos from commissioner Rob Manfred regarding sign-stealing and its consequences, which could result in grievances the players would probably win — never a good thing with another round of collective bargaining approaching.</p>
<p>“If they speak out, players were protected,” Taillon said. “I think it's tricky. If you’re a player on a team and your coaches, your team, tells you to do something, you don't want to be the one guy that's not fitting in and taking part in it. I don’t personally love sign stealing. It's something that, as a pitcher, it's just annoying, because we’re pretty vigilant about it.”</p>
<p>The investigation began after former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers went on the record and detailed the scheme to Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich in The Athletic, no easy decision for a member of baseball’s omertà-like culture.</p>
<p>“There’s a certain bond in baseball,” Musgrove said. “When stuff like that happens, you just keep your mouth shut. I didn't say anything. I talked to my teammates and told them, there’s stuff going on here, be aware, let's make sure we're on top of our signs, and we were. And that's something that has been going around the game for a while. If there were investigations to go on all throughout baseball, I’m sure you'd find a lot more than just one team doing stuff like that. I’ve been aware of it since I was there.”</p>
<p>As of now, the fallout is unclear.</p>
<p>“You have as much information, insight, as I do,” Pirates GM Ben Cherington said. “I really don’t know.”</p>
