<h1>Pirates’ Ke’Bryan Hayes tested positive for COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes, one of the Pirates’ top-ranked prospects, has not been in summer camp at all, despite being named to the roster that would prepare for the 2020 season at PNC Park.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the reason for that was made clear.</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton said in a Zoom call that Hayes tested positive for COVID-19 and recently gave the Pirates his consent to disclose that information. HIPAA laws prevent Major League Baseball teams from saying a player or staff member tested positive for coronavirus without that person’s consent.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Hayes’ confirmed positive now makes four Pirates who have tested positive and given their consent to have that made public, as Hayes joined right fielder Gregory Polanco, right-handed reliever Blake Cederlind and outfielder Socrates Brito.</p>
<p>Brito, so far, is the only player who has returned to action.</p>
<p>On a strictly baseball level, Hayes’ absence thus far in summer camp is concerning from a developmental standpoint. After playing a full season in Class-AAA Indianapolis last year, Hayes was thought to have had at least a puncher’s chance at making the 2020 opening day roster. Even if he hadn’t made it, the opportunity to spend three extra weeks with the big league club — learning and improving — would have been nice in a season where prospect development may be at a premium.</p>
<p>“Any time we lose development time, it’s challenging for us,” Shelton said Sunday. “As we’ve talked about numerous times, not just for [Hayes], but for all of our prospects, this is a big year for us. We have to be very thoughtful of how much work we get them and try to get them as much work as possible. Any time we lose prospect time, it’s challenging. But it’s just something that we’ll adapt and adjust [to] and move forward with.”</p>
<p>Shelton said Hayes remains in quarantine. Per MLB rules, he will have to produce two negative COVID-19 tests at least 24 hours apart and pass a physical as well as an antibody test in order to return to action.<em><br></em></p>
<p><strong>Murphy now the backup</strong></p>
<p>John Ryan Murphy is in a strange position right now.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, he is the Pirates’ backup catcher for the 2020 season. That is good news for a player who entered this season hoping to compete for the Pirates’ opening day roster with the knowledge that nothing was guaranteed.</p>
<p>The circumstances by which Murphy became backup catcher, though, are not ideal. Luke Maile, with whom Murphy was competing for the backup spot, fractured his index finger when he was hit by a pitch in an intrasquad scrimmage.</p>
<p>“I'm excited,” Murphy said Sunday. “Personally to step into that role, that's obviously a good thing for me moving forward. But you never want to see anything like that happen to anybody regardless of who they are or what position they play.”</p>
<p>Of course, that last part is true for any of the Pirates. As manager Derek Shelton alluded to last night, Maile had said he was feeling as well as he has in a long time.</p>
<p>“It’s really unfortunate for Luke because he felt like he was in one of the better spots he had been in his career swinging the bat, which was very evident in terms of how he looked during our intrasquad games,” Shelton said Saturday night. “Any time you lose catching depth, it dings you a little bit. But I’m really happy that we have ‘Murph’ here to be able to catch.”</p>
<p>As for Murphy, he feels he has done the necessary work in the offseason to be ready for this opportunity.</p>
<p>He said Sunday that he has taken time to watch game tape of the Pirates’ pitchers from the second half of last season. He has also picked starting catcher Jacob Stallings’ brain a bit on the personalities of the pitchers and some of the intricacies of communicating with them.</p>
<p>So, then, Murphy feels ready. He acknowledged that he was preparing for to fight for a roster spot before summer camp, and for two weeks, he and Maile did. Now, though, with Maile’s injury, Murphy is the de facto backup catcher.</p>
<p>“I went into spring knowing that it would probably be a competitive situation — and it was, all the way up until a couple of days ago,” Murphy said. “Moving forward is the only thing we can do, and that's what we're going to do.”</p>
<p><strong>Tucker outfield placement</strong></p>
<p>With Polanco’s positive COVID-19 test holding him out for at least the near future, the Pirates said over the weekend that shortstop Cole Tucker would get some reps in the outfield.</p>
<p>Since then, like on Sunday, Tucker has worked with first base coach Tarrik Brock, essentially getting a crash course to help prepare him for a position that he has never played before.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Shelton announced that the Pirates would give Tucker a test out there, saying that there’s “a strong chance” the Pirates would play Tucker either in center or right field at some point during their exhibition game against the Cleveland Indians on Monday night.</p>
<p>“Tuck’s done a great job,” bench coach Don Kelly said Sunday. “What an athlete he is. Just watching him move around the outfield, he’s going to be great out there. He moved around really well yesterday, went in right field. Just talking about some of the preparation stuff that you go through, being a shortstop — I know he played second base last night, and he’s added some versatility.”</p>
<p>Whether the work Tucker puts in now is enough to usurp players like outfielders Socrates Brito or Guillermo Heredia in the starting lineup remains to be seen, but at the very least, the Pirates seem to be taking Tucker’s transition into the outfield quite seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Williams to start second game of the season</strong></p>
<p>Right-hander Trevor Williams broke the news before Shelton got the chance.</p>
<p>On AT&amp;T Sportsnet’s broadcast of the Pirates’ exhibition against the Indians on Saturday night, Williams said in an in-game interview that he would be starting the Pirates’ second regular-season game next Saturday against the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>
<p>“It’s funny when I talked to Trevor today and I told him that I was going to lead with the fact that he was going to pitch Game 2, he was like, ‘Yeah, I think I might have already said that.’ ” Shelton said.</p>
<p>Beyond Joe Musgrove, who will start opening day against the Cardinals, and now Williams, Shelton says the Pirates don’t have the rest of the rotation scheduled quite yet.</p>
