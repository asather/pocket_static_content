<h1>PennDOT seeking public's input on traffic safety through annual survey</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation announced Monday morning it is again seeking feedback from motorists’ about traffic safety and driving behaviors through an annual survey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The questionnaire is available on PennDOT’s website through August 17, and will take around five minutes to complete, the company said. All responses and comments are anonymous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Safety is our top priority and we value continued public engagement in making our roadways safer,” PennDOT Secretary Yassmin Gramian said in a press release. “The results from this annual survey help us gauge participants’ attitudes on highway safety, and potentially allow us to adjust our safety activities so we can further reduce crashes and fatalities.”</p>
<p>More than 10,000 people responded to last year’s survey.</p>
<p>Around 91 percent of respondents said they always wear a seat belt and 89 percent said they never drive while impaired, PennDOT said in a statement. Fourteen percent of participants said “using a hand-held cell phone” was a distraction.</p>
<p>“Driving is a skill that requires 100 percent of your attention 100 percent of the time, and distractions are everywhere, it’s not just your cell phone,” Ms. Gramian said. “Don’t drive distracted.”</p>
<p>Thirty-eight percent indicated that “adjusting the radio or climate controls” was a distraction, while 37 percent said they were distracted by an object outside of the vehicle, the company added.</p>
<p>The Highway Safety Survey&nbsp;can be found online at <a href="http://www.PennDOT.gov/Safety." target="_blank">www.PennDOT.gov/Safety.</a></p>
