<h1>Hundreds gather for Pittsburgh-area demonstrations on racial injustice</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hundreds gathered Thursday at three Pittsburgh-area demonstrations to call for an end to racial injustice in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.</p>
<p>Several hundred people gathered&nbsp;at Squaw Valley Park in O’Hara for an afternoon Black Lives Matter rally.</p>
<p>In the city, nearly 200 people attended a demonstration at Pittsburgh Allderdice High School in Squirrel Hill that was sponsored by the school’s Black Student Union on the school lawn. The peaceful protest lasted about an hour.</p>
<p>And in Mt. Lebanon and Dormont, a Black Lives Matter march of more than 200 proceeded down Washington Road through the communities’ business districts to call attention to police brutality and racial injustice. Marchers chanted and sang as they walked along.</p>
<p>They stopped at Jefferson Drive, where some participants gave remarks before everyone sat on the street for 8 minutes and 46 seconds for a period of silence to honor Mr. Floyd. The period represented the length of time a white police officer kneeled on the neck of Mr. Floyd, a 46-year-old black unarmed man, before he died.</p>
<p>The Memorial Day killing has sparked numerous protests throughout the world, including many in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
