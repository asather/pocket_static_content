<h1>Polls: Steelers fans not very confident in Ben Roethlisberger's recovery, QB situation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What should the Steelers do at quarterback? How should they handle the contract situations of some of their stars? What grades do the coaches deserve for the 2019 season?&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the burning questions facing the team as the 2020 offseason gets underway, and fans have weighed in on all of those topics and more in polling on the Post-Gazette website this week. Let’s check out the results, shall we?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How confident are you that Ben Roethlisberger can regain his old form after elbow surgery?</strong></p>
<p>The quarterback’s Hall of Fame credentials aren’t enough to convince a lot of fans that he can bounce back from the injury that ended his 2019 campaign. A majority have some faith, saying that they’re very or somewhat confident. A plurality, however, remain skeptical, saying they’re not at all confident. Many of them, perhaps, are having flashbacks to the end of Terry Bradshaw’s run with the team, which was dogged by similar injuries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What should the Steelers do at backup quarterback this offseason?</strong></p>
<p>One season of Mason Rudolph and Devlin Hodges appears to have been enough for most fans. Nearly a majority said they want to see the team sign a veteran as insurance on Roethlisberger’s recovery, while almost another quarter want to see a young QB taken in the draft, even though the team gave up its first-round pick in the Minkah Fitzpatrick trade and won’t realistically get a chance to select one of the top prospects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What position should be the Steelers' top priority in free agency and the NFL draft?</strong></p>
<p>Consider this reinforcement of the point. Not only do fans think the Steelers need to look for outside help behind center, they think it’s the most important move the team could make. This despite struggles along the offensive line, likely losses on the defensive line and a near-total lack of production from the tight end spot. For a plurality, the problems began and ended with not having a suitable replacement for Roethlisberger, and they want one this time around, despite Mike Tomlin’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/12/31/ben-roethlisberger-injury-update-mike-tomlin-steelers/stories/201912310108" target="_blank">strong endorsement</a> of Rudolph in his end-of-season news conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What grades would you give coach Mike Tomlin, defensive coordinator Keith Butler and offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner in 2019.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passing grades all around, with a few surprises. Butler’s unit exceeded almost all preseason expectations. It was opportunistic, generating a lot of turnovers, and kept the team in games it had no business winning given the offense’s performance. Still, the plurality only sees that as B-level work? What more could he have done? Fichtner, meanwhile, seems to be getting the benefit of the doubt for Roethlisberger’s injury from many of the same fickle observers. Of those who shared an opinion, a majority voted to give him an A, B or C. This despite his unit’s long streak of producing no more than a touchdown per game.&nbsp;When it came to Tomlin, the support was there, but it was tepid. A majority gave him a B or C grade, which doesn’t quite match up with the Coach of the Year support he received around the league.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Should the Steelers try to sign WR JuJu Smith-Schuster and/or James Conner to a long-term deal?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Both earned Pro Bowl nods in 2018. Both struggled to replicate that production because of injuries in 2019. Fans, however, have come to very different conclusions about how they should fit into the Steelers’ future. Most want to see the team work out a deal with Smith-Schuster, while they’re out on Conner despite his Pitt tenure that included an inspirational comeback from cancer treatment. Conner has missed more games than Smith-Schuster the past two years, by a 9-4 margin. Still, quite a difference of opinion over five games. Perhaps it’s illustrative of how undervalued the running back spot on any team has become in the modern NFL.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What should the Steelers do with linebacker Bud Dupree?</strong></p>
<p>We can sum up these results as a resounding statement not to let him get away. Fans are almost evenly split on the method for bringing him back, but just 14% are willing to see him test the market for his talents after he notched 11.5 sacks opposite Pro Bowler T.J. Watt in 2019. That’s quite a turnaround from 2018, when many viewed him as a possible bust of a former first-round draft pick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How confident are you that the Steelers will reach the Super Bowl in the next five years?</strong></p>
<p>Overall, morale is low. Perhaps that’s to be expected after consecutive late-season collapses that cost the team playoff spots. Then again, we’re not talking about a double-digit loss team here. The Steelers were .500 despite all of their injuries, which many around the league have seen as an achievement rather than a failure. For that reason, the overwhelming lack of confidence in the franchise is at least a bit surprising.&nbsp;</p>
