<h1>Joe Starkey: Pirates couldn’t help but contend for bloated playoff field</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Let’s go with 66. That’s a pretty good number around here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/17/mlb-players-2020-season-negotiations-rob-manfred-tony-clark-meeting/stories/202006170144" target="_blank">Sooner or later</a>, baseball owners and players will agree that they agreed on something, and they’ll play. That much seems obvious.</p>
<p>Veteran scribe Jayson Stark has the number of games pegged at 66. Perfect. Combine that with a bloated playoff field — 16 of 30 teams would qualify — and you’re suddenly lending hope to the hopeless. Only the most wretched teams would fail to contend.</p>
<p>The Pirates are wretched-capable, as Mike Tomlin might put it. They need no endorsement from me. But I’m thinking they will merely be bad, and bad could get you a first-round date with the Dodgers.</p>
<p>After that? Well, as Billy Beane once said, “My job is to get us to the playoffs. Everything after that is (expletive) luck.”</p>
<p>I am not predicting a playoff spot here, let alone a playoff run. Please don’t accuse me of that. I am predicting the Pirates will contend for one.</p>
<p>How could they not?</p>
<p>Think about it: If the season is 66 games, you’d really be looking at the 56-game mark to determine contenders. Who’s within a couple of games of playoff position with 10 games left?</p>
<p>The Pirates of 2019, a truly wretched bunch, were 28-28 after 56 games — eighth place in the National League. That’s a playoff spot here in the land of Shangri-La.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at the Pirates after 56 games in each of the past four seasons, you’ll find they were among the top eight three times and a game out the other year (2017).</p>
<p>I’m telling you, it’s going to be nearly impossible to avoid contention. And if you really want to break it down, it’s the&nbsp;<em>46-game</em> mark, or thereabouts, where contention will matter most. That will be the approximate time of the trade deadline, if there is one (I hear Tyler Glasnow and Austin Meadows are available).</p>
<p>There might be a trade deadline a month-and-a-half into the season! I can’t decide if that’s pathetic or magnificent, but I know this much: It’s compelling.</p>
<p>I mean, 46 games? The 105-loss Pirates of 2010, one of the worst teams in franchise history, were four games out of eighth place after 46 games. They were buyers!</p>
<p>“We could see outcomes in a short season that are unexpected,” Pirates general manager Ben Cherington told 93.7 The Fan on Tuesday. “The shorter the season, probably the more potentially extreme outcomes could happen.”</p>
<p>I like extreme outcomes. I like sprints better than marathons. Every night’s a playoff game.</p>
<p>Do the Pirates have any strengths, or potential ones?</p>
<p>Sure they do. I agree with manager Derek Shelton, who says, “I think we have a good core group of young position players.”</p>
<p>Josh Bell, Bryan Reynolds, Kevin Newman and maybe even Gregory Polanco provide hope for a decent middle of the order.</p>
<p>The bullpen might be pretty good, too, and as Shelton put it, “I definitely think bullpens will be utilized more (in a short season). You may see leverage guys used a little sooner in games. It could be more on par with how teams have run their bullpens during a playoff series or during a pennant stretch.”</p>
<p>Keone Kela will close, and he was pretty dynamic over the final two months. The rest of the group has performed well over stretches — so you know it’s in there — while also pouring gasoline on a number of fires.</p>
<p>But there is absolutely talent. Kyle Crick has one of the game’s best wipeout sliders.</p>
<p>Richard Rodriguez gave up home runs like each carried a $6 million bonus last season, but he also had long runs of excellence. Combine his June, July and September, and in 38 appearances (36 innings), he had 35 strikeouts and a 1.25 ERA.</p>
<p>Micheal Feliz and Nick Burdi have swing-and-miss stuff. Feliz had 73 strikeouts in 56 innings. Burdi, coming off an injury, looked strong in spring training. So did Edgar Santana, who is coming off Tommy John surgery.</p>
<p>All I’m saying is it’s an intriguing group that in a short season could be utilized creatively and aggressively.</p>
<p>The Pirates would have nothing to lose in a 66-game season.</p>
<p>They’d be contenders. Just like everyone else.</p>
