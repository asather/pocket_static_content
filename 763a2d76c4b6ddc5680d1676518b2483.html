<h1>Cash, grit and Hollywood: Former Pitt players' untold stories from the recruiting trail</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Virtual tours, playing Madden with assistants, you name it. Coaches across college football are doing anything necessary to gain an edge in quarantine recruiting, which means the players in the class of 2021 are going to come away from this COVID-affected cycle with their own unique stories.</p>
<p>Which got us thinking: Former Pitt players have some pretty unique recruiting stories to tell, too, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Some declined to participate, adopting a “what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas” type of approach to their process. Fair enough. But several former Panthers opened up to the Post-Gazette about their weird recruiting experiences, whether it was with Pitt or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Here are those stories.</p>
<p><strong>Mark May</strong> visited five schools in 1976: Pitt, Penn State, Brigham Young, Rhode Island and Southern Methodist.</p>
<p>Syracuse wasn’t one of them, which was a surprise. The future College Football Hall of Famer, who grew up two hours away in Oneonta, N.Y., wanted to visit. That is, until a Syracuse recruiting assistant told him he was “too fat and too slow” to play for the Orange. So, May waved to that coach from the sidelines every year after Pitt beat Syracuse four times in a row from 1977-80.</p>
<p>As far as his actual visits, May said he was convinced by All-American defensive tackle Matt Millen not to pick Penn State. Rhode Island had co-ed dorms and a campus near the beach; that was nice, but it was still Rhode Island football. And BYU was gorgeous ... but May didn’t find out about the student code of conduct — the one that prohibits alcohol and demands sexual abstinence — until he got to campus.</p>
<p>“That’s not for me,” May said laughing. “Thanks anyway.”</p>
<p>Then, there was SMU.</p>
<p>The Mustangs were mediocre at the time. Head coach Ron Meyer, a former Dallas Cowboys assistant, was hired in ’76 and went 3-8 in his inaugural season. When May visited, Meyer was five years away from riding “The Pony Express” backfield of Eric Dickerson and Craig James to national prominence, and the program was 11 years away from the death penalty.</p>
<p>A death penalty caused by what, again? Ah, that’s right.</p>
<p>“I landed in Dallas, and Ron Meyer picked me up in a red convertible Eldorado with horns on the hood,” May said. “When I got to my room, there was an envelope on my bed, and it was labeled, ‘Expenses.’ Inside there were 10 $50 bills.”</p>
<p>May didn’t know where the $500 came from, and he didn’t ask.</p>
<p>“Great trip.”</p>
<p>Grit and toughness. That’s what fullbacks represent, and that’s what <strong>Henry Hynoski</strong> craved in a head coach.</p>
<p>Hynoski, the No. 7-ranked fullback in the 2007 class according to Rivals, was down to three schools. The future New York Giant wanted to commit before his senior season at Southern Columbia, so Pitt, Rutgers and Iowa were all making their final pushes. In July 2006, Pitt head coach Dave Wannstedt, offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh and assistant Greg Gattuso were slated for a home visit.</p>
<p>“When they got to the hotel the night before, coach Gattuso called me,” Hynoski said. “He said, ‘Hey Henry, coach Wannstedt, he’s pretty sick. He wants to tough it out. He doesn’t want you to know because he wants to be there and give his final talk and spend time with you. But I wanted to give you a head’s up.’”</p>
<p>Gattuso wasn’t joking.</p>
<p>“Coach Wannstedt comes in and he’s white as a ghost, trying to do his best to hold a conversation. Then he excuses himself, walks out the front door and starts throwing up in my front yard,” Hynoski said. “I committed shortly after that.”</p>
<p><strong>Pat Bostick</strong> remembers Bobby Petrino being an “interesting character.” That’s probably a generous way of describing a coach who once showed up to a press conference in a neck brace after misleading Arkansas officials about a motorcycle accident, but alas.</p>
<p>Petrino recruited Bostick hard in the spring of 2006, which made sense. Brian Brohm led Louisville to a 12-1 campaign that year and later threw for 4,000 yards in 2007 and was drafted in the second round by the Green Bay Packers. Bostick was the No. 6 quarterback in the country, and Petrino knew he had to look for the Cardinals’ next star signal-caller.</p>
<p>Even though he was offered by Georgia and Oklahoma, it came down to Pitt and Louisville for Bostick. Cavanaugh was his guy on the Panthers’ staff, and he was leaning toward Pitt in the spring before his senior year at Manheim Township. It was going to take something special from Louisville or another school to keep him from committing.</p>
<p>What he got was further assurance.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget, one day I got this package in the mail from Louisville. I was used to getting campus guides, media guides. But this thing was every bit as thick as an all-time record book,” Bostick said. “It was a book of statistics for every quarterback that ever played for Dave Wannstedt or Matt Cavanaugh and why I shouldn’t go to Pitt.”</p>
<p>The book featured Jay Fiedler, who had 68 touchdowns and 64 interceptions as Wannstedt’s quarterback with the Miami Dolphins from 2000-04. It mentioned Jim Harbaugh, who struggled mightily as Wannstedt’s Chicago Bears starter in 1993. It even criticized Tyler Palko, Pitt’s signal-caller from 2004-06.</p>
<p>“Getting basically a hate book, that was as low as it got for me,” Bostick said. “I called coach Petrino and told him I was committing to Pitt. I was in the cafeteria at my high school after school one day, and he kind of gave it to me. ‘You’re making a bad decision. You can throw for so many yards here.’</p>
<p>“They always say in recruiting that you don’t know who the coaches are until you get to campus. Well, in that case I found out ahead of time.”</p>
<p>A month went by and <strong>Scott Orndoff</strong> had no idea where he stood. His parents didn’t, either. “They were asking me, ‘Is the scholarship going to carry over?’” the tight end said. “I’m like, ‘I don’t know. This is all new to me.’”</p>
<p>Orndoff was caught in limbo. In August 2011, the three-star prospect from Seton-LaSalle committed to Wisconsin, where he would be mentored by offensive coordinator Paul Chryst and tight ends coach Joe Rudolph. Four months later, Chryst took the Pitt job, and Rudolph joined his staff.</p>
<p>When Orndoff saw that Rudolph was following Chryst to his hometown team, he was in. Problem was, he didn’t know if the new Pitt staff was in, too. Orndoff said he had no real way of getting in contact with Chryst or Rudolph because the cell phone numbers he had for them no longer worked. They had Madison, Wisc., area codes and were issued by the Badgers.</p>
<p>Finally, Orndoff got a call from Rudolph in early February asking if he’d be interested in an official visit. Orndoff accepted, taking a tour of the South Side facilities and campus on Feb. 16, 2011.&nbsp;Later that day, Rudolph was driving Orndoff down an access road behind the Petersen Events Center, where they’d watch the Pitt men’s basketball game against West Virginia. Rudolph came to a stop, and Orndoff asked him what he and his family were wondering for weeks.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if this is a stupid question, but do I, like, have an offer? From Pitt?” Orndoff asked Rudolph. Pitt’s new offensive coordinator looked perplexed. “’What? We haven’t offered you yet?’” Orndoff recalled. “And I go, ‘Well, here, no. Technically.’ He shakes my hand and goes, ‘Well, we’re offering you. Congratulations.’”</p>
<p>It worked out for Orndoff, who caught 35 passes as a senior and helped Pitt to its memorable upset of Clemson with 128 receiving yards and two touchdowns. But interestingly enough, if Orndoff stayed committed to Wisconsin, he would have played for Chryst and Rudolph by his junior year. The coaches were back in Wisconsin by Dec. 2014.</p>
<p>Go figure.</p>
<p>Nick Saban called during art class. Oklahoma offered after watching him dunk. <strong>Max Browne</strong> — a five-star quarterback from a small town in Washington state — did not have a normal recruiting process.</p>
<p>So it’s fitting Browne’s second recruitment wasn’t typical, either.</p>
<p>When Sam Darnold took the reins at USC in Sept. 2016, Browne’s future was clearly not with the Trojans. He was granted his release in late October and Pitt reached out almost immediately. By November, Browne found himself walking off the USC practice field, going to the locker room and, while still wearing his Trojans jersey, having phone conversations with Pitt offensive coordinator Matt Canada and lead recruiter Tim Salem.</p>
<p>“It was totally legal,” Browne said. “But it was trippy mentally, that whole process.”</p>
<p>As the 2016 regular season came to a close, Browne narrowed his search to three schools: Pitt, Boston College and Fresno State. If he waited until after spring practice, Pac-12 schools might have been in on the action, but Browne was dead set on enrolling in January. A two-week span in December decided where he’d end up.</p>
<p>Browne’s older brother lived seven minutes away from Los Angeles International Airport, and Canada wanted to meet in person before Browne visited Pitt. So, the coordinator flew out to California, rented a car, popped over to see Browne at his brother’s place, chatted for 30 minutes, drove back to LAX, dropped off the rental and went back to Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“The fact that I had a coach willing to fly across the country to say what’s up, that went a long way,” Browne said of Canada. “But then it was weird because 10 days later I flew out to Pittsburgh for my official, I met with him there, and then he took the LSU job days after that.”</p>
<p>That’s pretty much how it happened.</p>
<p>Browne got on a red eye to Pittsburgh on Friday, Dec. 9, caught the Panthers’ Pinstripe Bowl practice, napped, took a tour and hit the bars with his future teammates. He had his first-ever Yuengling at Stack’d in Oakland that night before meeting with Canada and the staff the next day. To his credit, Browne said the coordinator was up front that it would take a lot for him to leave Pitt amid coaching rumors — rumors that proved to be true.</p>
<p>On Dec. 14, news broke that Canada was leaving for LSU, where he’d be paid $1.5 million to call plays. A day later, Browne announced his commitment to Pitt anyway.</p>
<p>He already had a Kentucky letterman jacket. That’s how firm <strong>Bill Stull’s</strong> commitment was to the Wildcats. Or so he thought.</p>
<p>Stull, a three-star passer from Seton-LaSalle, had just wrapped a record-setting senior season, becoming the first WPIAL player to eclipse 3,000 passing yards in a single campaign. He guided Seton-LaSalle to the WPIAL Class AA title game, where he threw for 323 yards and five touchdowns against Aliquippa. And yet, Pitt never offered with Walt Harris at the helm.</p>
<p>So, when Stull and his buddies walked into the Seton-LaSalle gym to see a girls’ basketball game that winter, he was decked out in Kentucky gear.</p>
<p>“Then I get a call from a 412 number,” Stull said, before doing his best to imitate the voice on the other line. “‘Hey it’s Dave Wannstedt, head coach of the Pitt Panthers, yeah. ... Just wanted to double check to see how strong your commitment to Kentucky is.’”</p>
<p>Stull thought the Wannstedt call was a joke at first. When he realized it wasn’t, he told the new coach he hadn’t given Pitt any thought for some time. Wannstedt was hired in December 2004 after Harris was pushed out two months before signing day. Wannstedt had to scramble to put together a recruiting class and invited Stull to see Jamie Dixon’s No. 20 Panthers play No. 4 Syracuse at the Pete.</p>
<p>Stull went and took in the game with Pitt assistants. He heard whispers around the arena, people wondering why he was there. Kentucky head coach Rich Brooks was thinking the same thing, as word somehow got to Lexington that their pro-style prospect was engaging with the new Panther staff. Stull shut his phone off, ignoring concerned calls from Kentucky.</p>
<p>“I had an idea of what I wanted to do, but I wanted to make sure the feelings were mutual,” Stull said. “Shortly before halftime, me and Wannstedt went up an elevator, made a couple turns and went into an office I’ve still never found to this day. It was almost like I was in a movie. ... I was going through a whirlwind of emotions.”</p>
<p>Wannstedt offered, and Stull committed on the spot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the location of his Kentucky letterman jacket?&nbsp;“I have no clue,” Stull said.</p>
<p>In June 2005, 17-year-old <strong>Dorin Dickerson</strong> received a call from an unknown number. It was Reggie Bush.</p>
<p>“Think about it,” Bush, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, told Dickerson. “You go to school and girls are walking in their bikinis to class everyday and you live by the beach. You’re basically in Hollywood. Why wouldn’t you want to take a visit out here?”</p>
<p>USC put on the full-court press to get Dickerson — the second-ranked athlete and No. 55 overall prospect in the 2006 class, per 247 Sports. The West Allegheny standout committed to Pitt later that month, trying to avoid distractions in his senior season. But the nationwide interest never waned.</p>
<p>Michigan quarterbacks coach Scott Loeffler blew his phone up. Urban Meyer tried selling Tim Tebow and a spread offense that eventually won the BCS title in ’06. Penn State defensive coordinator and area recruiter Tom Bradley “made me want to go to Penn State,” Dickerson admitted. “That’s tough to say as a Pitt guy, but it’s true.”</p>
<p>And USC never stopped its pursuit, either. Pete Carroll’s son and USC tight ends coach Brennan Carroll — ironically, a former Pitt pass-catcher himself — nearly convinced Dickerson to come out to Los Angeles for a weekend. After his senior season, Dickerson was still thinking about visiting but wanted to show his loyalty and run the situation by Wannstedt.</p>
<p>Pitt’s coach was having lunch in his office when Dickerson popped in.</p>
<p>“He looked at me and he took his glasses off,” Dickerson said with a chuckle, “and he’s like, ‘Ya know what, Dorin? If you come here to the University of Pittsburgh and take care of business like you’re going to and you’re supposed to for the next four years, you can pay for yourself to go to Hollywood anytime you want to. When you play in the NFL, you’ll be able to go to Southern California any time you want to.’</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘Man, you really know how to talk to a young kid.’ ... That’s all I needed.”</p>
