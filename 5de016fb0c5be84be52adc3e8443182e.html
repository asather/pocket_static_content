<h1>Respect our citizens </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>During the first week of protests in Minneapolis following the killing of George Floyd, a Predator surveillance drone operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection circled the skies above the demonstrations. Federal officials claimed the drone was being used to provide “situational awareness,” whatever that means. Some members of Congress want to look into this and they should.</p>
<p>The use of military equipment to monitor citizens exercising the right to speech and assembly would represent a dangerous precedent and a potentially serious threat to Americans’ First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>In Salt Lake City, Utah, and Washington, D.C., Army National Guard Black Hawk helicopters were allegedly used in a comparably problematic fashion,</p>
<p>A group of 35 House members, led by Reps. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., and Bobby Rush, D-Ill., sent a letter to several federal agencies condemning the surveillance of the protests and demanding transparency regarding the use of military-grade equipment.</p>
<p>Let’s see where this investigation goes. But <em>peaceful</em> protests should not be surveilled by the federal government.</p>
<p>Tools of military intelligence should not be used to monitor American citizens exercising their constitutional rights.</p>
<p>The government works for the citizens, not the reverse. It needs to respect us and respect our rights.</p>
