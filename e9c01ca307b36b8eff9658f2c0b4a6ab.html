<h1>Stargazing: Don’t miss May’s super flower moon</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As Pennsylvania wildflowers paint the landscape with an Appalachian spring, the moon offers its own simple gifts for stargazers: the super flower moon.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a full moon will rise in the east-southeast and arc low over the horizon late in the evening sky. This full moon was known to the Algonquins and the Naudowessie tribes as the flower moon, heralding the botanical beauty of spring.</p>
<p>Sun-drenched and free of a shadow, a full moon still tells a compelling story of color, rock and time. Aluminum-rich rocks in the bright lunar highlands contrast the dark basalts of the maria, flat plains that formed from ancient lava flows that quickly cooled. Near the bottom of the lunar disk, the grandeur of Tycho Crater is framed by bright white rays that chalk the moon in a spoked wheel pattern. This “young” crater is only 108 million years old.</p>
<p>This month, the full moon happens to nearly coincide with perigee when the moon is at its closest point in its elliptical orbit around the Earth. This coincidence is celebrated as a supermoon, and the full moon will appear bigger and brighter than usual in the night sky. The apparent diameter of the supermoon from our perspective on Earth is about 7% greater than that of the average full moon.</p>
<p>This last supermoon of 2020 is an opportunity to enjoy a bright, beaming full moon and celebrate the bloom of springtime.</p>
