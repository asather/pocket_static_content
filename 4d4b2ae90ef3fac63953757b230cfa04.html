<h1>Pa. hopes people will trust COVID-19 notification app</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Officials involved with the creation of Pennsylvania’s upcoming COVID-19 notification app are worried about one issue above all others with the technology they hope will help contain the spread of the highly infectious virus: Privacy.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, at a press conference announcing the “COVID Alert PA” app would be ready to go in early September, Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine repeated multiple times, in different ways, that the app would tell a person if they were a close contact with someone who had tested positive “without compromising their identity or their location,” noting that the “entire system is anonymous,” and that the state is “concerned about maintaining privacy.”</p>
<p>When Allegheny County Health Department Director Debra Bogen was asked about the app a day later, one of the first issues she mentioned was similar: “The app the state selected is very conscientious and careful about privacy issues.”</p>
<p>In short, officials are deeply concerned any app would be seen as the kind of technology that spurs questions about government intrusion into our private lives —&nbsp;like the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/coronavirus-tracking-app-cheating-partners-married-south-korea-affair-a9514996.html" target="_blank">stories of the South Korean government</a> COVID-19 tracking app revealing love affairs while tracking people with the virus.</p>
<p>That has been an issue since the first idea of creating a “tracking app” —&nbsp;a phrase officials involved with Pennsylvania’s app don’t like, asking that reporters refer to it as a “notification” app — first came up early in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Shortly after tech giants Apple and Google in early April announced they were working together to develop the basic tracking technology for smartphones, the American Civil Liberties Union, among others, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-comment-applegoogle-covid-19-contact-tracing-effort" target="_blank">issued a declaration that any COVID-19 </a>tracing app be decentralized.</p>
<p>“People will only trust these systems if they protect privacy, remain voluntary, and store data on an individual's device, not a centralized repository,” the ACLU wrote.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania officials, and the company that created the app for the state, say that’s exactly what they’ve created.</p>
<p>The state’s app will let you know you were in “close contact” — defined as within 6 feet for 15 or more minutes — with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 sometime in the previous 14 days. But Dr. Levine said at her press conference, “It’s not going to store the specific location.”</p>
<p>“I know that people are concerned about that, that the government is somehow tracking their location,” she said. “It does not do that.”</p>
<p>While the voluntary app will tell a person — only if they downloaded the app — that they had a close contact with someone else who has the app, it will not say who the COVID-19 positive person was or where the contact occurred.</p>
<p>In addition, the Notification System Technology that Apple and Google developed that is the basis of Pennsylvania’s app, and most other states’s apps developed so far, will not tell health officials who the close contacts are. People will have to identify themselves to the health department after they receive an alert that tells them they were a close contact.</p>
<p>The state can only see three pieces of information: how many people total have uploaded the app; how many people who activated the app have uploaded a six-digit code the health department gave them if they have a positive test; and how many people were identified as a close contact overall.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania brought in experts from MIT to verify that “there’s nothing for citizens to worry about in terms of data protection and data privacy,” said Larry Breen, chief commercial officer for NearForm, the software company based in Waterford, Ireland, that developed the app for Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The state also brought in experts from the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Breen said, to make sure the app “delivers targeted messaging and helps citizens understand how to use the product, what it means to them, and, again, to help allay any fears and concerns, because there’s a lot of noise in the marketplace around data protection and privacy.”</p>
<p>The other states that have also rolled out statewide apps using the Apple and Google technology — Virginia, <a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/2020/08/14/state-of-north-dakota-updates-covid-19-tracing-app/" target="_blank">North Dakota</a> and <a href="https://county17.com/2020/08/15/wyoming-launches-new-covid-19-contact-app/" target="_blank">Wyoming</a>&nbsp;— all were deeply concerned about that as well.</p>
<p>Privacy and security “were at the top of our requirement list” when Virginia invited companies to bid to create a COVID-19 notification app, said Jeff Stover, the executive adviser in the office of the Virginia Health Commissioner who led the state’s effort.</p>
<p>The reasons for that are simply “because it’s an app being put out by the government,” he said. “In the world of public health, there’s a certain distrust of government, in particular in the African-American community because of cases like the Tuskegee syphilis study” where Black men with syphilis were left untreated by public health officials so they could study the disease.</p>
<p>“And there’s a whole different issue in the Hispanic community,” Mr. Stover said, “where they worry you’re tracking them because of illegal immigration issues.”</p>
<p>That’s a huge concern in this case, he said, because 50% of all of the people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in Virginia are Hispanic.</p>
<p>On top of that, he said, “There are groups that distrust the government in general.”</p>
<p>Virginia, which was <a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/northam-introduces-covidwise-covid-19-exposure-app/article_6cc61fba-a376-5297-b1c1-b63166d67ea7.html" target="_blank">the first state to get an app running statewide </a>using the Apple and Google technology, has done “pretty well” pushing the app out in the two weeks since it debuted, Mr. Stover said.</p>
<p>Nearly 400,000 people had downloaded the app by Thursday, Mr. Stover said, which is about 9.5% of all adults in the state ages 18 to 65 years old. That’s the target audience since about 80% of adults in that group have a cellphone.</p>
<p>Downloads have been growing by about 5,000 to 15,000 per day, but the state hopes to drive that further through a marketing campaign just getting started.</p>
<p>So far, just 19 people who have downloaded the app and tested positive have put in the six-digit pin that tells close contacts they tested positive, and only a few people have been identified as close contacts so far, Mr. Stover said, though he did not have an exact figure.</p>
<p>Ireland, using NearForm’s app, has been one of the worldwide success stories for COVID-19 notification systems, with just over 40% of its residents 16 years old and older downloading the app so far, Mr. Breen of NearForm said.</p>
<p>“It increased the effect of contract tracing,” he said, “with a 35% increase in identified contacts [of someone who had tested positive], so it makes your contact tracing team more effective.”</p>
<p>NearForm has also developed similar apps for Scotland, Northern Ireland, Gibraltar, and Delaware. The company is working with two other states who are close to announcing their apps, and is in the early stages of working with 10 to 15 other states or governments, Mr. Breen said.</p>
<p>Delaware, which is working to ensure its app will work both in Pennsylvania and Delaware because of the many people who commute back-and-forth, is equally concerned about people’s possible distrust of the technology.</p>
<p>“We hope we can overcome that,” said Jill Fredel, spokeswoman for Delaware’s Department of Health and Social Services. “Hopefully its use will spread through word of mouth as people tell each other, ‘I used it and found out I was a close contact.’”</p>
<p>So what will be the goal in Pennsylvania? Will 10% after two weeks be a good start? Will the state get 40% of adults to use the app?</p>
<p>No one knows.</p>
<p>“The reality of that is that as soon as we started seeing people actually use the app [in Ireland], even when it was super low numbers, it started having a positive impact,” Mr. Breen said.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine said while the state will roll out a marketing campaign to encourage people to download Pennsylvania’s app, she did not have a specific goal.</p>
<p>“Well, the more the better,” she said Tuesday. “It really just depends if more and more people in Pennsylvania do the right thing and download the app when it’s made available in September.</p>
<p>“The more people who have the app, the more effective it will be in this notification process.”</p>
