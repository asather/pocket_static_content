<h1>Duquesne becomes latest university to talk about its plan for fall amid COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Duquesne University on Wednesday <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/05/12/Robert-Morris-University-RMU-fall-classes-in-person-online-colleges-COVID-19/stories/202005120085" target="_blank">became the latest among its</a>&nbsp;Pittsburgh peers to articulate an intention to bring students onto campus for fall semester classes to the extent it can, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In an email sent late Wednesday afternoon to students and employees, president Ken Gormley said the university was developing what he called a&nbsp;“master plan” to enable the institution and its students “to move seamlessly into and out of any situation that emerges in the months ahead, regardless of what parameters are placed on us by health and government officials.”</p>
<p>He identified three general scenarios:</p>
<p>— Blended in-person and online classes, and scaled-back on-campus housing to reduce density as needed during the academic year;</p>
<p>— Fully online instruction is required for a period of the academic year, if the virus recurs and the government orders another period of shut-downs, with the ability to return to campus as health concerns ease.</p>
<p>Mr. Gormley said campus groups are studying varied aspects of the issue and will provide more detailed information in June.</p>
<p>“Of course, none of us has a crystal ball,” he said. “We do not know how much the virus will be mitigated by August, or what parameters health experts and government officials.”</p>
<p>But he also said:</p>
<p>“We are optimistic, given current modelling, that the virus will have abated sufficiently to permit some version of on-campus classes and residential housing in the fall, as long as appropriate modifications are made to ensure social distancing, enhanced hygiene measures, de-densifying in common spaces, testing, contact tracing, etc.”</p>
