<h1>Five Catholic churches to temporarily close due to COVID-19 case in South Hills parish</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Five churches in the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh will close for at least a week after an employee tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The employee worked at the St. Albert the Great church in Baldwin, part of the&nbsp;Blessed Trinity Parish in the South Hills, church officials said. That church and four others will be closed for daily Masses.</p>
<p>The other churches in the parish are&nbsp;St. Basil and St. Wendelin in Carrick, Holy Angels in Hays and St. Sylvester&nbsp;Brentwood. Those locations are being cleaned, and people who had direct&nbsp;exposure to the employee are being tested for the virus.</p>

<p>“As important as the spiritual health and well-being of our parishioners and local community is to me as the&nbsp;pastor of Blessed Trinity Parish, so too is their physical health and well-being, especially during these&nbsp;challenging times of the current pandemic,” Father Steve Kresak wrote in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A reopening schedule for the church is forthcoming, officials said.</p>
