<html><head><title>Nonprofit begins multimillion-dollar restoration project in Wilkinsburg</title></head><body><p>Considering that the Lohr Building on Wood Street in Wilkinsburg is more than 130 years old, it’s hard to think of it as “a work in progress.”</p><p>But that’s how Tracey Evans, executive director of the Wilkinsburg Community Development Corp., describes the landmark structure as she and the WCDC move their offices into the renovated first floor.</p><p>“It’s a complete new roof, new mechanical system, walls, electrical, plumbing, heating, new windows and a fire escape that will be installed later this month,” she said. “We are moved in, but we’re still finishing the rest of the building around us.”</p><p>The WCDC had been headquartered just up the street at 1001 Wood St. for 10 years. Now Ms. Evans and her staff are setting up shop in the iconic three-story red brick building with its arched glass windows overlooking the corner of Wood Street and South Avenue.</p><p>When it was built by Alexander Lohr in the late 1800s, those windows looked out on horse-and-buggy traffic in a Wilkinsburg that was just coming to life. Since then, the building has served as the first home of the Second United Methodist Church, a tailor’s shop, a newspaper office, a sewing machine store, a law firm and a bank.</p><p>But the past few decades haven’t been as kind to the building or its surrounding neighborhoods. Although Nancy’s Revival Diner has been operating in the adjoining building since the 1970s, the Lohr Building and the nearby Wilkinsburg Train Station have stood empty for a combined 50 years.</p><p>The WCDC tackled the challenge of breathing new life into those two structures with the intent of building a foundation for further renewal that would feed off of it. The effort represents a $9 million investment that will bring over 20,000 square feet of office or commercial space to the market.</p><p>“We’ve worked tirelessly to initiate these strategic, historic renovation projects that will spur private investments by providing anchor commercial properties that connect new tenants with existing and new Wilkinsburg business owners,” Ms. Evans said.</p><p>The WCDC last month announced receipt of a six-year, $3 million grant from the state's Neighborhood Partnership Program. The money will be invested in, among other development, the Lohr Building and Wilkinsburg Train Station projects.</p><p>It was the third NPP grant landed by the WCDC since 2010, bringing the total private and public investment in revitalizing the community to nearly $100 million.</p><p>"We are proud of the work that we have accomplished in the last 10 years," Ms. Evans said. "We have seen major multimillion-dollar projects like the Lohr Building and the train station go from concept to near completion, and programs to help small business owners lead to local entrepreneurship."</p><p>The Lohr Building, and its two substructures, reflects a $2.7 million investment. Ms. Evans said the goal is to attract another storefront on the ground level -- perhaps a music venue or restaurant to attract nighttime activity -- and have the two upper floors ready to rent by March.</p><p>“We loved the building’s rich history, its classic design and its prominent location,” said Ms. Evans. “Being located at a highly visible corner in the heart of Wilkinsburg’s business district is ideal for the WCDC. The Lohr Building project is a symbol of this community’s rebirth. We’re proud to play a role in restoring this once stately-building to its original luster for current and future generations to enjoy.</p><p>“We’re very close to the busway and train station renovation. Wood Street is a great size with small businesses. It’s walkable, pedestrian-friendly. And it’s slated to be changed from a one-way street to a two-way street, which would make it more accessible.”</p><p>Parking, she noted, is plentiful in adjacent metered lots.</p><p>“And a lot of people live on this street,” she added. “This street can really change in a positive way. That’s a big reason why we chose this building.”</p><p>Located less than three miles from Bakery Square and within walking distance to Regent Square neighborhoods, the Lohr Building offers tenants distinctive office space featuring 11- to 13-foot-high ceilings, abundant natural light, and rents that are roughly one-third of those in East Liberty, the WCDC said.</p><p>"We look forward to continuing to make progress in our goal to help Wilkinsburg return to the thriving, prosperous neighborhood it once was," Ms. Evans said. "A place where people of all ages and backgrounds increasingly want to live, raise their families and do business.”</p><p><em><a href="mailto:dmajors@post-gazette.com" target="_blank">dmajors@post-gazette.com</a> and 412-263-1456.</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2020/01/03/nonprofit-makes-move-to-first-multi-million-restoration-project-in-wilkinsburg/stories/202001030005</original_url>
