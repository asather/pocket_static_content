<h1>Fandemic — not pandemic — on the North Shore for Steelers gameday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Heinz Field was empty, but the North Shore was packed.</p>
<p>It seemed to be more of a fandemic than a pandemic Sunday, as the Steelers hosted the Denver Broncos. From the bank of the Allegheny River to the restaurants, fans were out in full force with plenty of people clad in black and gold roaming the riverfront waiting for the&nbsp;restaurants&nbsp;to open so they could follow the game on TVs there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Lines formed outside of The Foundry and Southern Tier before they opened. Barbara Lustik, who was in town from Cleveland, was among them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“My son is a huge Steeler fan, and we are going to have lunch at Southern Tier Brewing Company and just be part of the city. It’s a beautiful city,” said Ms. Lastick. She and her friend, Terry McGhee, of Twinsburg, Ohio, had no concerns about dining out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have seen them sanitizing and observing the rules so we feel safe,” she noted. “We were at Southern Tier yesterday for the Pumpkin Fest and we will be eating Downtown tonight,” said Ms. McGhee. “The Steelers playing today is just a perk for us. We are not afraid to have fun with all these people.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the people wandering the North Shore were wearing masks, which are required inside all the restaurants. Indoor capacity was set at 25%, but will be increased to 50% on Monday, with last call for drinks at 11 p.m. All the restaurants had some form of outdoor seating as well. Outdoor space is limited to 100 people.</p>
<p>As North Shore diners waited to be seated or served their meals, the Pittsburgh Steeline band drummed up enthusiasm for the game as it marched past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>They received support from fans like Ella Nabres, her husband Michael Nabres and their friend Kathy Patterson. All are from Birmingham, Ala.</p>
<p>“We would usually be tailgating during the game, but you know, because of COVID, so we&nbsp;mapped out a bar and will be here,” said Mr. Nabres, as the trio waited in line at Southern Tier. They did end up getting a table in the outdoor biergarden. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Four nurses from a local hospital were enjoying a much deserved break at The Foundry’s river-facing patio.</p>
<p>“We are just happy to be out, and Pittsburgh is doing it right,” said Olivia Palumbo&nbsp;referring&nbsp;to Allegheny County’s COVID-19&nbsp;protocols.</p>
<p>“Our numbers are great,” said fellow nurse Brandi Peroney.</p>
<p>They were with Julia Connolly and Lexi Botti.&nbsp;They all work together and felt The Foundry was a safe place to enjoy the game day atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corey Barber of North Carolina and his friend Al Craig of South Carolina decided to hang out at upscale cigar bar Burn by Rocky Patel. Craig is a Steelers fan, but his friend was wearing a Broncos jersey. Both wore masks while they sat on the outdoor patio.</p>
<p>“We came for a good time, and where ever the fun is at, we are willing to participate,” said Mr. Barber. &nbsp; &nbsp;“We feel safe eating here.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Southern Tier, Bar Louie, Burn and The Foundry, all located a block from Heinz Field, expected to be at their capacity limit.&nbsp; By the start of the game, Southern Tier already had an hour long wait for a table.</p>
<p>“We prefer sitting outside,” said David Mitchell, who was wearing a No. 7 Ben Roethlisberger jersey. His companion, Madi Hamilton, said she felt very safe. The couple had an outdoor table at Bar Louie.</p>
<p>“We are all six feet apart out here,” she said, noting that they wanted to be part of any Steelers activity that was available on Sunday. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Keith Brannan and his fiance Sandy Maraguglio, both of West Virginia, also wanted to be close to the action.</p>
<p>“I lived in Pittsburgh for 30 years, but am originally from Baltimore —&nbsp;I can’t stand the Ravens,” said Mr. Brannan. “We wanted to get some of the Steeler atmosphere.”</p>
<p>The couple were deciding which restaurant to go to. “We have our masks, and we are playing it safe and trusting everyone else is,” said Mr. Brannan. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The restaurant managers said the weekend was busy with the&nbsp;University&nbsp;of Pittsburgh playing Saturday and the Steelers on Sunday. While none wanted to talk on the record, they all said they appreciated the patronage from football fans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though tailgating was prohibited in the Alco Parking lots nearest to Heinz Field, and the&nbsp;restaurants&nbsp;were as full as they could be, some of Pittsburgh’s boating community decided to dock on the North Shore and celebrate there.</p>
<p>“Even though the lots are closed and you&nbsp;can’t go to the home games, we are going to watch the game here and enjoy being with each other,” said Jeff Martin, who, along with his friends, created a flotilla on the Allegheny just outside the stadium. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We all sit together at the games — there are about 25 of us, so we decided we would just do that together here,” said Kathy Oldaker.</p>
<p>“We aren’t going to let the virus keep us from a good time,” said Mike&nbsp;Oldaker, Kathy’s husband. “We are outside.”</p>
<p>Jen Setzenfand was with a group who has been watching Steelers games together for decades. On Sunday, the group, which included her husband, mother and friends, watched the Steelers beat the Broncos, 26-21, on TV from the stern of their boat.</p>
<p>“My dad has had season tickets since it was Three Rivers Stadium. We decided this year each person in our group would take a turn at their house to do the tailgate so we offered to do the first one on our boat since we could be right here by Heinz Field.</p>
<p>“We will listen to the fake crowd cheer but we will be the real crowd cheering,” she said laughing.</p>
