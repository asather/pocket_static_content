<p>HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf is urging lawmakers to pass legislation that requires businesses to provide paid sick and family leave for workers, saying Monday that it will help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said many workers lack any paid time off, and those working paycheck-to-paycheck are likelier to go to work, even if they feel sick, and infect co-workers.</p>
<p>“Workers should not have to choose between their job and their health, especially during this pandemic,” he told a news conference Monday.</p>
<p>The disparity in access to paid sick leave grows farther down the income ladder, with many more low-wage workers lacking it, Democrats say.</p>
<p>Thirteen states and Washington D.C. have enacted laws to require paid sick leave, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. A few states have temporarily broadened access to paid sick leave in response to the coronavirus, but none of those has adopted permanent and broad paid sick leave measures.</p>
<p>Paid sick leave legislation introduced by Democrats has sat untouched since last year in the Republican-controlled Legislature, amid opposition by business advocacy groups. Senate Republicans, in 2015 and 2017, tried but failed to block a Philadelphia city ordinance requiring paid sick leave. Pittsburgh also has a paid sick leave ordinance.</p>
<p>Democrats have redoubled efforts to urge the bills’ passage since the onset of the pandemic in March, saying requiring paid sick leave would lower health care costs, make workers and workplaces more efficient and improve public health.</p>
