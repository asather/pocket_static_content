<p>With Allegheny County going into the green phase, some musicians are jumping at the chance to be in front of a real live audience again.</p>
<p>“My band and I talked it over and we all agreed to keep safe and play the blues​,” says singer Freddye Stover, who fronts Miss Freddye’s Blue Band.</p>
<p>The Chicago-style blues singer, who was a Blues Music Award nominee in 2018, is stepping out Saturday night for a show at the <strong>Oakmont Theater</strong>.</p>
<p>In keeping with Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board guidelines, indoor seating is limited to less than 50 percent of capacity, six-feet distancing is required between patrons, no standing at the bar and dining parties are limited to four or fewer customers with a common relationship.</p>
<p>“We will be practicing safety and doing what we do best,” Miss Freddye said.</p>
<p>Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the music runs from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. Tickets are $20 at showclix.com.</p>
<p><strong>Jergel’s</strong>, in Marshall, is also going with live music this weekend, presenting an acoustic set with country-rock band Township Road on Friday and Nick and Danny of The Clintones on Saturday. Both shows are free and begin at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>The <strong>Crafthouse Stage &amp; Grill</strong> in Whitehall presents country-rock band Buckwild on Friday and a sing-along with Totally ‘80s on Saturday. Both begin at 9 p.m. with a $7 cover. Due to the limited capacity, they suggest calling for reservations: 412-653-2695.</p>
<p>The shows mark the partial end of a shutdown that began with the onset of the coronavirus the second week of March. They come the same weekend that the Three Rivers Arts Festival is doing its performances as livestreams.</p>
<p>There is no word yet on when Mr. Smalls, Club Cafe, The Roxian and other popular venues plan to open.</p>
