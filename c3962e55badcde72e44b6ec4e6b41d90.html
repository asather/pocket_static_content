<h1>Pirates spring training: Mitch Keller starts strong, struggles with slider against Blue Jays </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>DUNEDIN, Fla. â€” Mitch Keller got off to a strong start, but a few errant sliders marred his outing in a Pirates' 4-0 loss against the Toronto Blue Jays on Monday.</p>
<p>Keller breezed through the first inning with three groundouts by Santiago Espinal, Cavan Biggio, and Lourdes Gurriel Jr.</p>
<p>Keller began the second inning by striking out the dangerous Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Keller threw a filthy curveball that started in the strike zone before diving toward Guerrero, who swung through the pitch.</p>
<p>"I feel comfortable with the curve because I've been throwing it all my life," Keller said after the game. "I'm in a good place with that pitch."</p>
<p>Keller wasn't in as right of a spot with the slider. He hung one to Brandon Drury and the ball landed well over the fence in left field for a two-run home run to give the Blue Jays a two-run advantage.</p>
<p>"My slider is still coming along. I've had a few of them back up on me," Keller said. "I will keep working on it through spring. I had that one that left the yard. I want to keep getting better there."</p>
<p>Keller also hurt his cause with a bad pickoff attempt. He walked Randal Grichuk on four straight pitches after striking out Guerrero, and Grichuk ended up on second base after Keller's throw bounced in front of Jose Osuna at first base.</p>
<p>Drury drove in Grichuk three pitches later.</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Geoff Hartlieb bounced back from an arduous outing on Thursday with a scoreless frame on Monday. Hartlieb threw his fastball with proper velocity and his sinker was sharp.</p>
<p>"I felt good out there," Hartlieb said. "I'm getting a lot of positive reinforcement here. I'm perfecting what I'm trying to do here. I'm still learning who I am as a big-league pitcher."</p>
<p>Edgar Santana retired all three of the hitters he faced. Santana has three scoreless innings in a row this spring.</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates used the four-person outfield during one of Biggio's at-bats in the game. It's the second game they've used the alignment. Adam Frazier played left-center field as he did on Sunday. Biggio grounded out, so we didn't get to see a play by Frazier.</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>Jason Martin was 1-for-2 and has a hit in three of his last four games.</p>
<p><strong>Up Next</strong></p>
<p>Off day Tuesday. The Pirates split the squad Wednesday for games against the Phillies and Braves.&nbsp;</p>
