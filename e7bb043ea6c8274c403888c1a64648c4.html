<h1>Joe Biden says he'll pick running mate by Aug. 1</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president, told supporters Wednesday night that his campaign has interviewed every candidate on his short list to be his running mate and hoped to name the woman by Aug. 1.</p>
<p>To fill the job he last held, Mr. Biden said he’s looking for someone whose views align with his, but who also brings different qualities to the ticket.</p>
<p>“I think that I need somebody who in fact is simpatico with me, both in terms of personality as well as substance. That means that they don’t have to agree with me on everything, but they have to have the same basic approach to how we handle the economy and how we handle everything,” Mr. Biden said during a virtual fundraiser with former presidential primary opponent and now top surrogate, Pete Buttigieg.</p>
<p>He added that he wants someone who isn’t afraid to be “completely candid” with him.</p>
<p>“I want to have people around me that have strengths and capacities I don’t,” he added.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden is only looking at women for the job. Those rumored to be under consideration include Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Rep. Val Demings of Florida and former Georgia state representative Stacey Abrams.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden and his running mate will be officially nominated at the Democratic National Convention slated to begin on Aug. 17.</p>
