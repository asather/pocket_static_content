<h1>Mars school board terminates money plan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Mars Area school board has terminated a 2014 interest rate management plan, saving more than $1 million and divesting themselves of a risky investment.</p>
<p>Interest rate management plans, also known as interest rate swaps or swaptions, were undertaken by school districts beginning in 2005 by a company that is no longer doing business in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“They are investments, in my opinion, that school districts should never get involved in again,” district Solicitor Tom King said at the March 3 board meeting. “This is a rare opportunity to get rid of these dogs while they are not barking.”</p>
<p>Mr. King added that the Butler Area School District had to pay $5,000 to get out of their swaptions.</p>
<p>Jill Swaney, business manager, said the savings will be applied to the district’s debt service annually. If the savings are $1 million, $80,000 a year will be applied to debt.</p>
<p>Financial advisers had told board members last month that they could save more than $1 million by terminating the swap this year but could save double that if they wait until next year.</p>
<p>Resident Bill Sommers told members that they should wait.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t make sense to not look at more savings,” he said. “There are ways to lock in a better savings.”</p>
<p>In other business, Superintendent Wesley Shipley said the superintendents in Butler County are working with the county health department on responses to COVID-19 should it spread to the county.</p>
<p>A letter, signed by all the superintendents, will be sent to families this week outlining procedures and including advice from school nurses and the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Mars Area has a pandemic response protocol in its emergency operations plan, he said.</p>
<p>“Use best judgment. Don’t come to school if you are sick,” he said.</p>
