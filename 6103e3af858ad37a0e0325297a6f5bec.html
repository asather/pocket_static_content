<h1>House flippers going rogue</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>They’ve been prospecting in Lawrenceville for years. They are becoming a hassle in some North Side neighborhoods. And now house flippers are pestering residents of Garfield and Hazelwood.</p>
<p>Karen Thompson started getting mailers a couple years ago at her home on North Fairmount Street in Garfield. They have since become relentless, she said.</p>
<p>One reads, in part, “NOTICE I am contacting you regarding the property at __. I pay cash and can close quickly. I buy as-is and there are no fees and commissions. House need repairs? No problem. We can easily handle liens, judgments and any other issues.”</p>
<p>Ms. Thompson’s&nbsp;house is paid off. It’s the one her parents bought in 1964. She is retired. Her siblings visit for the holidays. She knows many of her neighbors and says they are similarly besieged by offers.</p>
<p>Garfield, whose median home value is $156,000, is the fresh meat sandwiched between two of the city’s hottest markets —&nbsp;Lawrenceville and East Liberty.&nbsp;In Lawrenceville, some houses are now selling in the $700,000 to $800,000 range, while the median home value is $263,294, according to Zillow. That leaves a lot of room for a flipper to profit.</p>
<p>There is so much incentive that some flippers may even be calling the city’s 311 hotline anonymously to complain about properties that they want to buy. This is what some say they suspect.</p>
<p>“This is a big issue, one more predatory practice,” said Dave Breingan, executive director of Lawrenceville United, citing code violation letters that arrive on the heels of relentless offers.</p>
<p>Then there are those who simply knock on doors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A woman who lives on Main Street, who is 80, answered a knock on her door by someone who convinced her to take $100 cash toward a $70,000 purchase price,” Mr. Breingan said. “Luckily, her family got wind of it and were able to get her out of the contract.”</p>
<p>Ms. Thompson, who volunteers for several agencies and serves as a board member of the Bloomfield Garfield Corp., said she felt compelled to speak out because that can help other people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At our meetings, we talk at length about affordability and keeping people in their homes,” she said.&nbsp;“I have felt put-upon, but a lot of my neighbors might fall victim.”</p>
<p>What made Ms. Thompson feel particularly put-upon was a legal drama last spring. An anonymous caller to 311 complained that the parking pad and ramp beside her house — on property she had bought from the city — was installed without a permit.</p>
<p>Someone had dug into the records to discover that her contractor had not pulled a permit.</p>
<p>The violation notice was a surprise, and it seemed suspicious coming three years after the work was done.</p>
<p>“There had been no pushback by any neighbor about this parking pad,” she said, pulling from her folder supportive letters from neighbors to zoning officials.</p>
<p>She had to pay for a hearing and get a variance, but not before she received a notice to stand before the magistrate.</p>
<p><strong>‘Garfield’s Gold Coast’</strong></p>
<p>While much of Garfield remains pockmarked by blight, North Fairmount is “Garfield’s Gold Coast,” said architect Gary Cirrincione, a member of the Garfield Land Trust, as is Ms. Thompson.</p>
<p>The land trust was created on the model of similar ones in Oakland and Lawrenceville. The Trust is a nonprofit that buys homes it wants to keep affordable, owning the land in perpetuity and imposing conditions on the sales prices, allowing the seller to profit without gouging the next buyer.</p>
<p>North Fairmount sales prices and estimates have steadily inched upward in recent years. On Zillow and Trulia, estimated home prices in several Fairmount blocks north of Penn Avenue have hit the $200,000 to $300,000 range.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are struggling to maintain their homes and not be displaced,” said Mr. Cirrincione, who has gotten robocalls —&nbsp;one at 4 a.m. — wanting to buy his house on Hays Street.</p>
<p>“One of the things we want the land trust to do is to sustain people in their homes. That’s a direct corollary to the affordable housing crisis.”</p>
<p>Mr. Cirrincione said Ms. Thompson has such a good heart and does so much for others that when she was having trouble, he had to react.</p>
<p>“I went with a couple of neighbors to her zoning hearing and to the magistrate with her because she felt threatened,” he said. “Karen’s is a precautionary tale.”</p>
<p><strong>Flipper heaven</strong></p>
<p>Pittsburgh is among seven cities that showed double-digit increases in the home flipping rate at the start of 2019 over the year before, according to Attomdata Solutions, a property and demographic data analytics company in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s rate was up 36%. The other cities were Raleigh, N.C., Milwaukee, San Antonio, Houston, Atlanta and Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Among 138 metropolitan areas with at least 50 home flips completed in the first quarter of 2019, Pittsburgh had the highest average gross flipping rate of investment, up 131.2% over the previous year, it reported. A flip is defined as a home bought and sold within one year.</p>
<p>The push to get homeowners to sell doesn’t stop in Garfield.</p>
<p>Across the Monongahela River in Hazelwood, redevelopment of Hazelwood Green — the former brownfield that was once occupied by the J&amp;L Coke plant — has also mobilized cash-for-houses entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>“I know people are getting flyers or postcards asking to buy their homes,” Sonya Tilghman, executive director of the Hazelwood Initiative, said. “I figured it would be coming our way. We tell people to speak with a trusted adviser because they could be eligible for assistance to make repairs. There are resources available.”</p>
<p>Parts of the North Side are feeling the pressure, too.</p>
<p>Sandra Hazley owns a rental in Deutschtown, near Allegheny General Hospital. For about five years, she has been approached. The house needs some loving care, she acknowledged, but she said she can’t afford to improve it too much and still afford to accommodate her low-income renters.</p>
<p>“They’re good people, so if I can pay the taxes and make repairs, I’m happy,” she said</p>
<p>She paid $13,000 for the house about 10 years ago.&nbsp;“When someone called to say they are interested in the house, I said the asking price is $195,000, and I didn’t hear from them again.”</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, she was cited by the city for peeling paint on the house.</p>
<p>“I had someone scrape it while I was on vacation, but I was still getting violation notices in the mail. I got a notice to show up at the magistrate’s office.”</p>
<p>She convinced the inspector the problem had been fixed.</p>
<p>She rejects the suggestion that a neighbor ratted on her over peeling paint in November. She said she recognized that someone had set the process in motion to wear her down.</p>
<p>“I’m really glad people are picking up on this, but I don’t know how they can ever stop it.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Check these guys out’</strong></p>
<p>It is not unlawful to mail people offers to buy their properties. And if someone is using the 311 system to nudge homeowners into selling, magistrates and innocent inspectors wouldn’t know that. If a complaint is accurate, the inspectors are required to cite.</p>
<p>People in the business of buying houses for cash say it is incumbent upon the prey to guard against would-be predators.</p>
<p>“The best thing for people to do is check these guys out,” said Steve Towanda, owner of WebuyPittsburgh.net. “It’s important for people to get multiple offers.”</p>
<p>As home prices increase in Pittsburgh, the number of people getting in on his business is growing.</p>
<p>“There are companies that sell people a $1,000 course on how they can do this in 30 days,” said Mr. Towanda. “I’ve been in this business for 25 years, and I attend seminars where so many people are trying to do this.”</p>
<p>He disdained those in his line of work who prey on people, but he said some homeowners&nbsp;may have good reasons to accept less than their houses might be worth — “for instance, if they can’t afford to make it nice enough for a Realtor to sell quickly, and because of its condition or datedness, a Realtor may not take it on.”</p>
<p>Joshua Caldwell, a spokesman for Pittsburgh Real Estate Investors, agreed that homeowners need to be careful.&nbsp;“There are a lot of fly-by-nights, but there are a lot of legitimate people who do this right.”</p>
