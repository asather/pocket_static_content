<h1>Steelers' Art Rooney II on Rooney Rule: NFL is 'not where we need to be'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The son of the man whom the Rooney Rule is named after provided his thoughts on how the rule is being implemented by NFL front offices Tuesday.</p>
<p>Steelers owner and president Art Rooney II talked with NFL Network’s Steve Wyche about how he believes the Rooney Rule — which was meant to provide minority coaching candidates with interview opportunities they might not otherwise receive — has not allowed diversity to thrive in the NFL beyond the playing field as was its intention.</p>
<p>“I think where we are right now is not where we want to be, not where we need to be,” he said. “We need to take a step back and look at what’s happening with our hiring processes.</p>
<p>“The first thing we’ll do as part of our diversity committee is really review this past season’s hiring cycle and make sure we understand what went on and talk to the people involved, both on the owner’s side, management side, as well as the people who were interviewed.”</p>
<p>The Rooney Rule, named after late Steelers president (and Art’s father) Dan Rooney, was adopted in 2003. It mandates that NFL teams must interview at least one minority candidate when searching for their next head coach. The rule was <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000999110/article/nfl-expands-rooney-rule-requirements-to-strengthen-diversity" target="_blank">later expanded</a> to included searches for general manager and equivalent front office positions.</p>
<p>There were five head coaching vacancies after the 2019-20 season ended, and four of them were filled by non-minority coaches with the fifth job going to the Latino Ron Rivera, who was fired by Carolina midway through the season and quickly hired by Washington. That resulted in plenty of frustration from both pundits <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/10/nfl-rooney-rule-discussion-2020-offseason-james-harrison-ryan-clark/stories/202001100136" target="_blank">and a few ex-Steelers</a> who don’t think that minority coaching candidates were getting a fair shot.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 2018 NFL season, there were eight head coaches of color — seven black, one Latino — operating in the NFL. There are currently only three black head coaches — the Los Angeles Chargers’ Anthony Lynn, Miami’s Brian Flores and, of course, Pittsburgh’s Mike Tomlin — and one Latino coach (Rivera) employed today.</p>
<p>Wyche asked Rooney, who is the chairman of the NFL’s Workplace Diversity Committee, if there was any chance of expanding the rule to mandate even more interviews of minority candidates for head coaching positions.</p>
<p>The Steelers’ president pointed toward a recent amendment to the rule that required the minority candidate to come from outside the organization as a sign that the rule was malleable and subject to change if that were to be deemed necessary.</p>
<p>“Obviously, we have to look at what we can do differently now, and perhaps even expand the Rooney Rule into some of the lower levels, perhaps the coordinator level, just to make sure the minority opportunities are there,” he said.</p>
<p>Rooney pointed toward the rule’s initial helpful impact but admitted that recently it has fallen short of its stated goals.</p>
<p>“A thing we have to look at is, back when the Rooney Rule was passed and put into effect in 2003, there was a period there where we did see an increase in minority hiring at the head coach position,” he said. “Over a period of time, there were 10 or 12 minority coaches hired. Since then, that trend seems to have reversed itself, particularly in the last few years.</p>
<p>“So we need to study what’s going on and understand better what’s going on and really decide how we improve the situation.”</p>
