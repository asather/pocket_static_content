<h1>Restaurants and bars in Allegheny and most surrounding counties can open at half capacity Friday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Less than 48 hours after learning that they could resume limited outdoor yellow phase operations Friday, the service industry in most of southwestern Pennsylvania got some more good news “on the fly,” as they say in restaurant speak.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf’s Friday afternoon announcement that Allegheny and all other surrounding counties (except Beaver) will move to the green phase of reopening on June 5 means that bars and restaurants can skip right to offering indoor service to customers as well.</p>
<p>The list of protocols for Pennsylvania is lengthy and detailed, but the primary required takeaways include:</p>
<p>• Maximum occupancy limits for indoor and outdoor areas must be posted and strictly enforced. The new maximum occupancy is calculated as 50% of the previously stated fire capacity or 12 people per 1,000 square feet if there is not a fire code number available. The more restrictive number must be used.</p>
<p>• All customers are to wear masks while entering, exiting or otherwise traveling throughout the restaurant or retail food service business. Face coverings may be removed while seated.</p>
<p>• Customers being served must be seated at a table, and there must be at least 6 feet between parties at tables.</p>
<p>• Employers must provide nonmedical masks for employees to wear at all times and make it mandatory to wear masks while at the restaurant or retail food service business (with very limited exceptions).</p>
<p>In addition, there are myriad cleaning protocols. The entire document <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20200527-Restaurant-Industry-Guidance.pdf" target="_blank">can be read here</a>.</p>
<p>Bill Fuller,&nbsp;president of the Big Burrito Restaurant Group,&nbsp;calls it the “new weird” rather than the new normal, but for right now, he’ll certainly take it.</p>
<p>“Going green was what we’d hoped for when you’re trying to keep everyone safe. It’s really difficult to do enough volume to make sense to open the patio, unless you have a giant, giant patio,” he said. “For most of our places it wasn’t gonna be enough.”</p>
<p>“I hope with the 50% capacity combined with holding on to a lot of the increased takeout sales, we might be able to make our businesses at least stop losing a ton of money. That’s what we hope for from the green phase.”</p>
<p>Mr. Fuller took a field trip up to Centre County on Friday to see how the first day of “green” operations were going at the Mad Mex in State College, so he can bring those observations back to greater Pittsburgh where the vast majority of the company’s 18 restaurants and 1,050 employees reside.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to kind of hang out and see what the vibe was, and it’s good,” he said. Given that Penn State University is closed, he said that the patio was full “for the number of seats we can have,” and the inside did a brisk business.</p>
<p>“We want to use the experience this weekend in State College to see what demand looks like and then adjust and prepare,” he said adding that much like Pennsylvania itself, Big Burrito restaurants will open in phases.</p>
<p>“We’re not gonna be able to bring everyone back and get everybody back to work,” he said. “We also don’t know if more than 50% of people are gonna wanna go out right now right away. I talked to three dozen or more people that I know that are regular going-to-restaurants kinds of people, and it was a mixture of reactions.”</p>
<p>He said the same thing to Big Burrito’s employees.</p>
<p>“As you might imagine there’s the full range,” he said. “There are people who haven’t been worried about it since the beginning, there are people that are like, ‘I’m gonna be careful, but that’s fine,’ and then we’ve had a couple of people that said, ‘I’m not gonna come back to work.’”</p>
<p>Eat’n Park, which employs roughly 5,000 people systemwide, said in a release that all but three of its Pennsylvania restaurants — Center Township, Chippewa and Erie —&nbsp;will&nbsp;reopen for dine-in service on June 5, along with a raft of new safety and cleaning procedures.</p>
<p>Over at Fat Head’s on the South Side, owner Glenn Begnini also said that his establishment has likewise enhanced protocols for his 80 employees. He also said that the previous yellow announcement wasn’t enough to merit excitement, but resuming indoor operations is.</p>
<p>He and general manager Ryan Bonatesta have spent weeks reconfiguring seats and stools so patrons can safely belly up to the bar and maintain social distancing norms.</p>
<p>“I’m glad, obviously,” he said. “It’s not gonna be easy financially —&nbsp;most restaurants don’t make a profit until you’re at 75% full —&nbsp;but we’ll be glad to get some sense of normalcy back.</p>
<p>“We’re hoping it’ll be business as usual but just on a smaller scale,” he said.</p>
<p>“This has been three months. People are itching to get back out, I think. To get back to work and to get out and enjoy a meal even if there are a little bit of new rules and regulations involved.”</p>
