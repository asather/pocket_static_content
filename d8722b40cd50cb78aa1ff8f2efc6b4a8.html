<h1>Pittsburgh Diocese announces parish mergers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh on Wednesday announced more than five dozen parishes in the region will merge into 15 parishes July 1.</p>
<p>The parishes will be formed out of 15 current parish groupings, part of the diocese’s ongoing restructuring under its On Mission for The Church Alive program. The mergers will bring the number of parishes in the diocese from 152 to 106.</p>
<p>The new parishes are:</p>
<p>Each merger was requested by the priest-administrator of each parish grouping, and was approved by&nbsp;Bishop David Zubik after consultation with&nbsp;the diocesan Priest Council and Vicars General.</p>
<p>“This is a pivotal time for our diocese as we plan for the future of the Church of Pittsburgh,” Bishop Zubik wrote in a statement. “Southwestern Pennsylvania is radically different than it was 100, 50, 20, even 10 years ago, yet the work of the church and our call from God to bring His love to everyone continues as strong as ever.”</p>
<p>July 1 also marks the beginning of the reorganization of four regional vicariates into two: a North Vicariate and South Vicariate, headed respectively by the Rev. John Gizler III, and the Rev. Joseph E. Sioli.</p>
