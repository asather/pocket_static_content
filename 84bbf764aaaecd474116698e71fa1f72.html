<h1>Chariers City man pleads guilty to manslaughter in 2018 shooting death</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rashem Littleberry and De’Von Dozier were arguing in the hallway of a Crafton Heights home on June 14, 2018, when, one witness said, Dozier asked something like, “You wanna fight?”</p>
<p>The witness didn’t hear Littleberry respond, but did hear a single gunshot.</p>
<p>The bullet struck Dozier in the thigh, severing his femoral artery.</p>
<p>After being taken from the Woodlow Street home, he died several hours later at Allegheny General Hospital.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Littleberry,&nbsp;29, of Chartiers City pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Susan Evashavik DiLucente sentenced him to spend 4½&nbsp;to nine years in prison to be followed by three years probation.</p>
<p>Dana Becoate, Dozier’s grandmother, told the court that she was there the day her grandson took his first breath and when he took his last.</p>
<p>“I watched him grow up,” she said. “He was a gentle young man. He loved everyone. He trusted everyone.”</p>
<p>Ms. Becoate said that Dozier, 23, had two sons of his own. Dozier’s own father was a victim of homicide in 2003, and she said her grandson had hopes and dreams of raising his 6- and 4-year-olds differently.</p>
<p>“He had such hopes and dreams to be a dad for them,” she said.&nbsp;“He was determined he was going to be a better dad.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kia Dozier, the victim’s mother, called Littleberry’s actions that day “a cowardly response to an invitation to a fistfight.”</p>
<p>Ms. Dozier told the judge that another one of her sons, Diondre Dozier, was killed in 2014 at the age of 17.</p>
<p>When she learned what happened to De’Von, she said, “I remember screaming, ‘Not again,’ and I hit the ground.”</p>
<p>Then, nine hours later, as medical staff continued to work on him, she said, they asked her if they could stop.</p>
<p>“Because someone is careless. Because someone has a bad temper. Because someone is a coward, why should I have to answer that question?” she asked.</p>
<p>“The pain is constant,” Ms. Dozier concluded. “It is mentally and physically debilitating.”</p>
<p>Judge DiLucente sympathized with Dozier's family.</p>
<p>"It has to be the most horrific pain and suffering in the whole world," she told them. "It's a horrible thing."</p>
<p>The judge said she was sentencing Littleberry in the mitigated range of the recommended guidelines because he accepted responsibility for his crime by pleading guilty.</p>
<p>She acknowledged that it was "a pretty short sentence for taking a life," but told the defendant that if he committed any new crimes after his release, and while he is still under supervision by her, she won't hesitate to send him back to state prison.</p>
<p>"You have caused so much pain and heartbreak, it's unimaginable to what these people are living with everyday," the judge said. "It was so unnecessary. It's sickening."</p>
<p>Defense attorney Lisa Middleman said that she has seen her client’s attitude change since his initial arrest.</p>
<p>“He knows that what he did was wrong,” she said.</p>
<p>Littleberry sees that the lifestyle he was living also was wrong, Ms. Middleman continued. “He finally understands that and is focused on a situation where he is engaging in a productive environment.”</p>
<p>The defendant apologized to Dozier’s family.</p>
<p>“I was wrong for my actions,” he said. “I made an impulsive decision out of anger.”</p>
