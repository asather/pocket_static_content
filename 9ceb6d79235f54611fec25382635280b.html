<h1>'Bee Lady' swarmed with help when she takes a tumble</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Halfway into her stint Thursday as the Bee Lady, standing at Allegheny River Boulevard and Washington Boulevard in Highland Park, Darlene Kuszyk had gotten dozens of waves in return for her wave, plus toots and honks from cars and trucks as she held her “Bee Safe” sign, when she said, “Ohh, I’m woozy.”</p>
<p>She stepped up into the weeds and sat on the rim of a pedestal that held a blackened city of Pittsburgh crest.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she pitched forward into the weeds. She got herself rolled over, saying she was OK. By the time an ambulance arrived, Ms. Kuszyk had been swarmed by people. First, within seconds of her fall, a man appeared, exiting his truck — Ian Richards, who was just passing by with his mother.</p>
<p>“When I saw the bee go down, yeah, we pulled over,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Richards happens to be a firefighter and EMT in North Fayette. He asked Ms. Kuszyk questions and helped her out of her oversized, hot bumblebee costume. It sat in the weeds like a beanbag cushion. She set her bee bonnet aside, too, its little yellow pompons dancing at the ends of two stiff pipe cleaners.</p>
<p>It was a cool morning, which was why she decided to go out Thursday, but the sun was piercingly brilliant and she was standing directly in it.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Sheriff’s Department Sgt. Doug Clark stopped next, bending over her, asking her if she took any medications.</p>
<p>She said she does take blood pressure medication, then she said, “I’m so embarrassed about this.”</p>
<p>Next was Allegheny County Sheriff’s Detective Rich Venezia, who said, “it’s what we do.”</p>
<p>Next, Jody Noble Choder, a nearby resident, stopped, asking, “Hey Bee Lady, do you need some water?”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Fire Department EMTs from Lincoln-Lemington came next, wrapping a blood pressure cuff around Ms. Kuszyk’s right arm and strapping an oxygen mask over her head. They monitored the clamp on her finger as they spoke with her.</p>
<p>Then the ambulance wail approached, and the ambulance turned into the parking lot of the Brilliant Boat Club where Ms. Kuszyk had parked before 11 a.m. for what she had expected would be a one-hour gift of uplift to drivers passing by at the busy intersection.</p>
<p>Waves, honks and thumbs-up help to uplift her, too, she said, but she had never expected to experience the more personal gift of people stopping to make sure that she was safe.</p>
<p>Later in the day, she reported that she was fine. She hadn’t eaten before going out that morning and had been out the day before at the same spot.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have done it two days in a row. It’s hard for me to stand very long because I had both knees replaced last year. As I was waving and holding my sign, my arms were feeling heavy, then I knew I had to sit down.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kuszyk, 68, of Penn Hills, is a retired secretary, having worked for 30 years for Westinghouse and then eight years for a law firm Downtown.</p>
<p>The idea of being the Bee Lady came to her in the spring.</p>
<p>“When the coronavirus started and we were all in lockdown, it affected me like it did a lot of people,” she said. “I was isolated and feeling depressed. So in April, I came up with an idea. I’m the fun one in the family.</p>
<p>“I remembered I had a bee costume I’d made for Halloween years ago. I made one for me and my husband. We were docents at the zoo, and we would wear them for the haunted house at the zoo.”</p>
<p>A crafter and seamstress, Ms. Kuszyk said the bee costumes were hanging in the closet as she planned on how to get back out in the public while being safe.</p>
<p>“I thought, ‘be safe,’ and I had a bee costume. I always wanted to be a mascot, too!”</p>
<p>She got the costume out, stuffed the part around the hips with newspaper to make it balloon out, and put it on over her head, its foam wings perched on the back. She pulled on black gloves and fluffy yellow wrist bands, strapped on her bee bonnet and stood on her street, holding her sign and waving. She has done this a couple times a week when it isn’t too hot to stand that long in the costume.</p>
<p>“People stopped and took pictures of me. They waved and honked. Then I started going to other places. It made me happy and it made other people happy too. And it got me out of the house.</p>
<p>“Port Authority bus drivers honked, men in the garbage trucks honked.</p>
<p>“One day on Laketon Road, a lady got out of her car and said, ‘I want to thank you. I’m a nurse and I have a hard job and seeing you really cheers me up.’</p>
<p>“It turned out she lived on my street. I asked her if she’d like to be a bee with me and she said, ‘Absolutely.’ She’s going to be a bee with me on Saturday.”</p>
<p>Before she felt faint on Thursday, she positioned herself at the entrance of the boat club parking lot and began receiving feedback immediately from vehicles. A Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority truck driver honked. A woman in a Jeep, stopped at the light, took a video of the Bee Lady from behind the wheel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She got a generous blurt of honks from a Diamond Cargo Express driver, a wave from the driver of an Aramark truck, two blasts from an ECM Transport driver, a toot from a woman in a white Porsche and a toot from a man in a gray Silverado. A car with Florida plates passed: “toot-ta-toot-toot.”</p>
<p>That afternoon, back home, awaiting a previously scheduled doctor’s appointment, Ms. Kuszyk was finally eating and resting.</p>
<p>“The ambulance ladies helped me take all my stuff to my car,” she said. “I lost my car keys and thought, ‘What the heck?’ but I found them in the costume. I’m embarrassed” by all the attention, she said, especially when she knew she was going to be fine, “but I was amazed at all the people who showed up.”</p>
