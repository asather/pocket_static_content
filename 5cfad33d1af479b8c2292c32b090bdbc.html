<h1>Steelers aren't missing Javon Hargrave thanks to Tyson Alualu's stellar play</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Javon Hargrave left the Steelers to sign with the Eagles as a free agent, it left a hole in the middle of the defense. Hargrave held down the starting nose guard duties for the Steelers for four seasons after getting drafted out of South Carolina State in the third round of the 2016 draft, and his versatility helped him expand his role that ultimately earned him a three-year, $39 million deal on the other side of the state.</p>
<p>The Steelers replaced him with Tyson Alualu, a 33-year old veteran who is making $2.75 million this year in the final year of his contract. An older and cheaper option in the middle of one of the NFL’s fastest and most ferocious defenses didn’t seem like a viable plan to keep the Steelers elite, but Alualu is turning back the clock and playing some of his best football in his 11th NFL season.</p>
<p>How good? Well, T.J. Watt is the highest-graded Steelers defender according to Pro Football Focus. Alualu&nbsp;is second.</p>
<p>On a defensive line that includes Cam Heyward and Stephon Tuitt, two of the highest-paid defensive linemen in the league, that is quite an accomplishment through three games, though his teammates aren’t the least bit surprised Alualu is playing at a high level.</p>
<p>“No, I’m not,” Tuitt said. “Tyson can play every position on the defensive line. Tyson is a very stout player and I knew that position would be very good for him. I’m not surprised at all what he’s doing and the production he’s having. He is a great defensive lineman.”</p>
<p>The Jaguars certainly thought that when they made him the No. 10 overall pick in the 2010 draft. He was the third defensive tackle selected after Ndamukong Suh (No. 2 overall) and Gerald McCoy (No. 3 overall).</p>
<p>Alualu started 64 consecutive games upon arriving in Jacksonville, but his role was reduced starting in 2014, when he did not start once, and he was allowed to become a free agent following the 2016 season.</p>
<p>The Steelers signed Alualu to be the top reserve along the defensive line, but he ended up starting 13 games from 2017-19, mostly when Tuitt was injured. He is now a full-time starter again and helping the Steelers shut down running lanes and get after opposing quarterbacks.</p>
<p>The Steelers have the NFL’s top-ranked run defense and lead the league in sacks per game.</p>
<p>“Tyson has stepped up,” Heyward said. “We’re pretty lucky to have a guy like that. He hasn’t missed a beat. It’s one thing to go from playing sub-package with him — he’s always been a great communicator, is able to see things on the field — but playing nose, he’s even expanded on that. He’s found ways to get one-on-one matchups. He’s able to communicate that to me and Tuitt, and we’ve been able to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>“I think him being in our system for so long and knowing what we expect from the nose tackle position, he knew what to do, and he’s going out there and doing it. He plays with strong hands, good leverage and great effort. When you have that type of formula, you’re going to be destined for success.”</p>
<p>In addition to being a force in the run game, Alualu has one sack, three quarterback hits and two passes defensed. It’s the same type of value Hargrave provided, but at a much cheaper price.</p>
<p>“We liked Javon,” Steelers defensive coordinator Keith Butler said. “He was a good player for us. We knew Tyson was a good player for us, too. You hate to lose good players, but that happens in the National Football League. When I played, we struck a couple of times so these guys could make money and get the free agency system we were trying to get. He took advantage of it, and you can’t blame him for that. But we’re glad we have Tyson, too. He’s done a good job for us.”</p>
<p>Hargrave isn’t off to the best of starts with the Eagles. He suffered a pectoral strain in training camp that kept him out of the season opener. He has played in the past three games, but as a reserve. Veteran Malik Jackson has started ahead of Hargrave, who has a half-sack while playing just 35% of the team’s defensive snaps.</p>
<p>“Well, for us, early in the season he was a little banged up, so he missed some time,” Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. “But he’s come back strong. He’s looking like the Javon Hargrave of old. Man, you just put on tape from last year and the last couple years, you just see an explosive guy. Obviously in a different scheme, but you see that explosiveness in coming off the ball, pushing the pocket, and does a nice job in the run game.</p>
<p>“It fits well with what we do, just based on his skill set. He’s been a good leader of that defensive line, and because he missed time early in our season, he’s just now kind of feeling good and getting himself into game shape.”</p>
<p><strong>Injury report</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers added star pass-rusher T.J. Watt to the injury report Thursday. He missed practice with a knee injury after participating fully Wednesday. It could just be a maintenance day for Watt ahead of the Eagles matchup Sunday, but more clarity will come Friday after practice.</p>
<p>Linebacker/safety Marcus Allen (plantar fasciitis) and fullback Derek Watt (hamstring) remained out, casting further doubt on their availability for Sunday. Wide receivers JuJu Smith-Schuster (knee) and Diontae Johnson (toe) returned to practice, as expected, after sitting out the first of the week.</p>
<p>Cornerback Joe Haden, who missed Wednesday with an illness, also was back.</p>
