<h1>Pittsburgh Dance Council delays start of season until January</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Curating a season of contemporary dance from around the world is tricky. Doing it during a global pandemic is even trickier.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Dance Council on Thursday announced that it will stay dark this fall and resume in-person programming in January 2021. Performances by five companies, including Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, will be presented through next May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were several reasons the Dance Council’s 51st season won’t kick off in the fall as usual. For starters, one piece was a work in development, said Randal Miller, director of dance programming and special projects for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. It likely wouldn’t have been finished in time because dancers haven’t been able to get together in the studio. Two of the companies are from overseas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Dance is particularly expensive and requires a tremendous amount of subsidy, even when [things are going] well,” he said.&nbsp;“We just couldn’t take that risk not knowing how and when theaters would reopen, not to mention travel bans and work visas, which can be difficult in perfect times.”</p>
<p>He’s optimistic that the spring lineup will go on as planned, beginning with Hubbard Street Dance Chicago at Byham Theater. It will stage a mixed repertory program, including&nbsp;Ohad Naharin’s&nbsp;“Minus 16,”&nbsp;Osnel Delgado’s&nbsp;“Windless Hold” and&nbsp;Aszure Barton’s “Return to Patience.” Some are connected to works presented during the current 50th anniversary season, Mr. Miller said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“One of the things I find very interesting about watching repertory companies is seeing how the voice of choreographers manifest themselves differently on different companies. Even if it’s the exact same piece, it wouldn’t look the same.”</p>
<p>In February, New York City-based Complexions Contemporary Ballet will bring its signature mix of ballet and hip-hop to the Byham Theater in Downtown. The company is the product of two former Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater dancers, Desmond Richardson and Dwight Rhoden, a longtime Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre collaborator. Complexions will stage&nbsp;“Bach 25,” billed as a&nbsp;“fast-paced, jubilant” work celebrating the music of&nbsp;Johann Sebastian Bach, and&nbsp;“Woke,” a sociopolitical piece danced to songs by Kendrick Lamar, Logic, Diplo and Drake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most unusual program next spring comes from Le Patin Libre, a troupe of contemporary ice skaters from Montreal, Canada. They’ll share a blend of dance, skating and theatrics in March at the MassMutual Pittsburgh ice rink at PPG Place, Downtown.</p>
<p>“We are paying to keep the ice frozen for the week after it closes to the public. We will set up an infrastructure with bleachers and such to create a situation where this is an arena outdoors,” Mr. Miller said.&nbsp;“We have to walk a thin line between it being comfortable and being too warm. Hopefully we can catch a nice medium.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audiences will return to Byham Theater in April for Pilobolus, last seen on a Dance Council program in 2017. (Fun fact: It’s named after a fungus that its late co-founder, Jonathan Wolken, studied in his father’s biophysics laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University.) This time, it will take audiences through its 50-year history with&nbsp;“BIG FIVE OH!,” the vintage classic&nbsp;“Untitled” and the high-voltage&nbsp;“Megawatt,” along with shadow works and other surprises.</p>
<p>The spring season will end with a nod to the Pittsburgh Dance Council’s own golden anniversary celebration, which was cut short because of COVID-19. Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, one of those canceled in the 2019-20 season, has been rescheduled for next April at Benedum Center. The company was the first one presented by the Dance Council during its inaugural season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subscriptions can be purchased in packages of four shows starting at $40. Full spring 2021 season subscriptions range from $60 to $330 at 412-456-1390. Single tickets, which start at $10, will go on sale at a later date at <a href="https://trustarts.org/pct_home/events/series/pittsburgh-dance-council" target="_blank">trustarts.org/dance</a> or 412-456-6666.</p>
