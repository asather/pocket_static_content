The Downtown location will operate Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.&nbsp;Designated service times for people who are over 60 years old are set for&nbsp;Wednesday and Thursday mornings between 8:30 and 10:30.</p>

<p>After reopening, those facilities will operate Tuesdays through Saturdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these centers have designated service times for people who are over 60 years old on Wednesday and Thursday mornings between 8:30 and 10:30.</p>
<p>Services available at the centers will include commercial driver's license transactions, out-of-state transfers and driver's license restoration services.</p>
<p>Commercial road testing will not be available during the initial reopening, nor will any services that can be done online.</p>
<p>The McConnellsburg photo license center will open Friday, and will be operating&nbsp;Fridays and Saturdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Photo license centers in Clairton, East Liberty and Monroeville will open Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PennDOT officials said customers seeking renewal of noncommercial licenses or IDs should renew them online or by mail to avoid unnecessary visits and because wait times will be longer due to increased demands following the monthslong closures.</p>
