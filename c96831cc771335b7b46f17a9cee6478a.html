<h1>Westmoreland County landfill seeks to evaporate contaminated runoff</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Westmoreland Sanitary Landfill, which accepts a significant amount of shale gas drilling waste, has applied for a state permit to evaporate contaminated liquid runoff from the site and send tons of pollutants, including hazardous substances, into the air.</p>
<p>If approved by the state Department of Environmental Protection, the 1 million gallon a month evaporation process also could concentrate radioactivity in the residue left behind.</p>
<p>According to a state Department of Environmental Protection’s notice in the May 9 Pennsylvania Bulletin, the landfill’s evaporation system would have the potential to annually emit into the air 16 tons of coarse and fine soot, 2 tons of nitrogen oxides, 2 tons of carbon monoxide, 1 ton of volatile organic compounds, 400 pounds of sulfur dioxide and 1,000 pounds of hazardous air pollutants.</p>
<p>Ro Rozier, a landfill spokeswoman, said a new landfill “ultra-filtration” system will remove “most” solids from the runoff, known as leachate, before it is evaporated in an as-yet-to-be-built, methane powered facility.</p>
<p>“The landfill is currently trucking 100% of its leachate to properly permitted offsite treatment facilities,” Ms. Rozier said, “and with this proposed evaporator, it is anticipated that trucking will no longer be required.”</p>
<p>The tanker truck transport of the leachate was necessitated in May 2019, after the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2019/05/15/Rostraver-landfill-s-drilling-waste-sewage-problem-Mon-River-Belle-Vernon-DEP/stories/201905150136" target="_blank">Belle Vernon sewage treatment plant stopped </a>accepting the landfill’s wastewater because its high volume and toxic chemicals were damaging the plant’s ability to treat wastewater discharged into the Monongahela River. A sampling of the landfill’s liquid also found high radioactivity.</p>
<p>The <em>Bulletin</em> notice details the DEP’s intent to issue a landfill Air Quality Plan, which is required for construction and temporary operation of the evaporation facility not to exceed 180 days, although extensions can be granted. The facility would still require a long-term operating permit.</p>
<p>According to the DEP, the facility will heat and evaporate up to 45,000 gallons of leachate a day, reducing the volume of the liquid waste by 95%. The landfill plans to use two existing 550,000-gallon tanks and a proposed new 91,000-gallon tank to store and funnel leachate to its evaporator.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania landfills are not allowed to accept liquid waste but all landfills produce leachate generated by stormwater percolating through the on-site garbage. The Westmoreland landfill, like several others in the state, also accepts a large amount of shale gas drilling waste rock and soil for disposal.</p>
<p>The landfill began accepting shale gas drilling waste -- soil and rock and chemicals produced by the drilling and fracking process -- in 2010. In 2017 it took in 119,716 tons of that waste, about 40% of its total waste stream. In 2018 it received 159,845 tons of drilling waste, about 47% of its total tonnage for the year.</p>
<p>As a result, the leachate coming off the landfill in Rostraver, Westmoreland County, also contains high concentrations of radioactivity produced by radium 226 and 228, said John Stolz, a professor of biological sciences and director of the Center for Environmental Research and Education at Duquesne University.</p>
<p>Those elements occur naturally in shale gas drilling and fracking waste dug up from a mile or more underground, and the radiation can cause bone cancer and other cancers.</p>
<p>But Mr. Stolz said the permit notice says nothing about the radioactivity of the leachate, how it's going to be handled during and after the evaporation process, whether any will be emitted into the air, or what will be done with the leftover radioactive residue.</p>
<p>“The radioactivity is not being addressed in this permit, and the leachate is not typical landfill leachate but rather has more in common with produced water and brine from oil and gas drilling,” said Mr. Stolz.</p>
<p>He said a landfill leachate sample he analyzed in the spring of 2019 contained 370 picocuries per liter of total radium, and, based on that data, the evaporation of the 45,000 gallons a day of leachate produced by the landfill would contain more than 63 million picocuries of radium.</p>
<p>“Where is that radiation going?” he said. “Probably not the air, but in the solids left behind after evaporation. And where will that residue end up at the end of the day?”</p>
<p>Mr. Stolz said the leachate evaporation process will increase the radioactivity of the solid residue left behind , creating “TENORM” -- technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material.</p>
<p>Ms. Rozier said all waste loads trucked into the landfill are tested for radioactivity prior to disposal, and any waste deemed hazardous is rejected by the landfill.</p>
<p>“While it is not foreseen,” she said in an email response to questions, “in the event that any residual wastes from the evaporation process results in a level of radiation that exceeds the permit requirements, the waste will be taken off-site to an appropriately permitted facility for disposal.”</p>
<p>The Westmoreland landfill,which also goes by the name Tervita-Rostraver Township Sanitary Landfill,&nbsp;agreed to pay<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2020/02/18/landfill-Westmoreland-sanitary-DEP-consent-order-waste-runoff/stories/202002180167" target="_blank"> a $24,000 penalty</a> for improperly disposing of shale gas drilling waste and contaminated liquids in 2019. The DEP consent order also required the landfill to minimize the amount of contaminated stormwater and liquid filtering through the landfill, and build a new treatment facility to treat the leachate.</p>
<p>And in a separate, on-going investigation, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2019/05/23/westmoreland-sanitary-landfill-contaminated-runoff-investigate-fracking-pennsylvania-belle-vernon/stories/201905230159" target="_blank">state attorney general’s Environmental Crimes Section</a> is reviewing the damage the contaminated leachate caused at the sewage treatment plant. Part of that inquiry focuses on a January 2019 DEP email that proposed allowing the poorly treated discharges to continue flowing into the river, but have the landfill pay for any fines. The Belle Vernon municipal authority rejected that offer.</p>
<p>Lauren Fraley, a DEP spokeswoman, said in an email response to questions that the department has not been provided with any evidence of high radiation levels in the Westmoreland landfill leachate, but noted that the February consent order requires the landfill to do “enhanced analysis” of its leachate, including for radium.</p>
<p>Ms. Fraley also cited the results of a 2016 DEP TENORM study that evaluated leachate from landfills across the state and concluded that “there is little difference in radium levels detected in leachate from landfills that accept oil and gas industry waste and those that do not.</p>
<p>A public comment period on the DEP’s plan approval ends June 9.</p>
<p>According to the notice, “A person may oppose the proposed plan approval by filing a written protest with the Department through Melissa Jativa, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 400 Waterfront Drive, Pittsburgh, PA, 15222; mjativa@pa.gov; or fax 412.442.4194. Individuals may also request a public hearing on the plan approval.</p>
