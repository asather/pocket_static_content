<h1>Kobe Bryant billboards pop up in Pittsburgh to honor former NBA star </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Multiple billboards paying tribute to the life of former NBA star Kobe Bryant appeared around the region Monday, a day after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/01/27/Kobe-Bryant-helicopter-crash-fog-pilot/stories/202001270099" target="_blank">the retired pro athlete was killed</a> in a helicopter crash.</p>
<p>The crash claimed the lives of all aboard, including Mr. Bryant’s 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, as well as seven others in Calabasas, Calif., Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Nearly 24 hours later, drivers in Etna could spot purple billboards along Route 28 with Mr. Bryant’s face next to the word “legend” in purple and gold letters, representing his time with the Los Angeles Lakers. The digital billboards rotate images.</p>
<p>The billboards are owned by Lamar Advertising Company, who has stake in over 360,000 billboards across the U.S. and Canada. The agency tweeted a message Monday morning letting travelers know to look for Mr. Bryant’s face during their commute.</p>
<p>“We join in mourning the tragic passing of NBA legend and global icon Kobe Bryant and remember his greatness and contributions on and off the basketball court. #KobeRIP,” the company said.</p>
<p>Mr. Bryant was believed to be headed for his youth sports academy in nearby Thousand Oaks, which was holding a basketball tournament Sunday in which Mr. Bryant’s daughter, known as Gigi, was competing.</p>
<p>The aircraft crashed into a hillside about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles around 9:45 a.m</p>
<p>Among those killed in the crash were John Altobelli, 56, longtime head coach of Southern California’s Orange Coast College baseball team; his wife, Keri; and daughter, Alyssa, who played on the same basketball team as Mr. Bryant’s daughter; Christina Mauser, a girls’ basketball coach at a Southern California elementary school; and Ara Zobayan, the pilot.</p>
