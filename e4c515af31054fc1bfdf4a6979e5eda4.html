<h1>Ten charged federally in connection with '11 Hunnit' gang in the Hill District </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ten people from Pittsburgh, McKees Rocks, Pitcairn and other Allegheny County communities have been charged with drug dealing following an FBI-led wiretap investigation into the 11 Hunnit street gang in the Hill District that federal agents say was led in part by slain rapper Jimmy Wopo.</p>
<p>The 10 were charged in four complaints filed earlier this month in federal court and unsealed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The first complaint charges five people with conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine from January 2020 until this month: Phillip Robinson, 30, of Pittsburgh; Joseph Clancy, 46, of Pittsburgh; Tyree Campbell, 29, of Pittsburgh; Tracy Bullock, 51, of McKees Rocks; and Sanzio Williams, 31, of Pitcairn.</p>
<p>Wiretaps and surveillance revealed that Clancy supplied Robinson, who redistributed the drugs to the other alleged co-conspirators.</p>
<p>All of those charged have at least one prior narcotics conviction, federal prosecutors said.</p>
<p>In a second complaint, Andre Moore-Coleman, 31, of Pittsburgh and James Bryant Jr., 52, of McKees Rocks are accused of dealing heroin. Wiretaps revealed that Moore-Coleman, identified as a supplier, conspired with Bryant and others to distribute heroin in Pittsburgh and McKees Rocks.</p>
<p>Both men also have prior drug convictions, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>A third complaint charges Ronald Lewis III, 42, of Turtle Creek and Victor Simmons, 24, of Pittsburgh with dealing in crack. Lewis, identified as a crack source, conspired with Simmons — who redistributed the drug in Pittsburgh and throughout Allegheny County — according to the FBI.</p>
<p>They also have prior drug convictions, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>A fourth complaint charges Derek Calloway, 26, of Pittsburgh with possession of a gun and ammunition by a felon based on a May 13, 2020, search of his residence.</p>
