<h1>Counties, GOP leaders ask court to deny Wolf on shutdown orders</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A group of plaintiffs who sued Gov. Wolf over his COVID-19 restrictions and won a federal court ruling have again reiterated their stance that U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV was correct in declaring the restrictions unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs on Wednesday filed their response to the Wolf administration's request that Judge Stickman's order be stayed.</p>
<p>"This court should refrain from the extraordinary relief sought by the defendants," their lawyers wrote in a brief to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. "They have failed to balance the equities in their favor as required by this court in evaluating motions to Stay. Defendants have not sustained their burden and are left with multiple arrows in their public health quiver.</p>
<p>“This case does not eliminate public health measures such as masks, gloves, social distancing, or uniform percentage occupancies applied in a constitutionally permissible manner. However, it does reverse the constitutional violations asserted before the District Court under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Granting a stay would reimpose those same constitutional violations. For these reasons, the motion for stay should be denied by this court."</p>
<p>The Wolf administration had asked Judge Stickman of the Western District of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh to stay his order striking down several of the main restrictions imposed by Mr. Wolf and his secretary of health, Dr. Rachel Levine.</p>
<p>The judge's ruling meant that gatherings of more than 250 people outside and 25 inside, not including bars and restaurants for routine business purposes, would be permitted despite the fact that the state continues to urge citizens to avoid big gatherings.</p>
<p>The governor’s request for a stay was denied, and the Wolf administration then appealed to the 3rd Circuit, asking for a stay pending appeal.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs had until today to file their response.</p>
<p>They largely repeated earlier arguments that Judge Stickman's ruling was correct.</p>
<p>They said the Wolf administration is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its argument. On the issue of business closure, for example, the plaintiffs said "the issue before this court is not whether the state may order businesses to close temporarily in the face of a pandemic; it is whether that order is applied equally to similarly situated persons and businesses. As the District Court found, even under a rational basis analysis, the plaintiffs have been denied equal protection of the law."</p>
<p>The plaintiffs also said the defendants will not suffer irreparable harm if the stay is denied, saying the Wolf administration "seeks to invalidate the District Court’s analysis in one broad sweeping stroke in the form of their motion without ever submitting any medical testimony as to why their request would cause irreparable harm."</p>
<p>The plaintiffs also said they will suffer harm if the stay is granted, citing the judge's ruling that violations of due process that interfere with the right to operate a business and earn a living are "serious deprivations" that could cause irreparable harm.</p>
<p>They also argued that the public interest favors denial of the stay.</p>
<p>"There is no time in our history that the continued infringement upon and violation of the citizens’ constitutional rights can be said to further the public’s interest," the lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the case are the counties of Washington, Butler, Greene and Fayette along with U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of Butler County and state Reps. Marci Mustello of Butler County, Daryl Metcalfe of Cranberry and Tim Bonner of Grove City. All are Republicans.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, several Pennsylvania House Republicans filed a "friend of the court" brief with the 3rd Circuit asking the judges to deny a stay.</p>
<p>House leaders said the General Assembly has given the governor and secretary broad power to act in an emergency.</p>
<p>But, they said, that also means the governor and secretary can "exercise their authority in ways that are contrary" to the Constitution.</p>
<p>"It is therefore critically important, in this context, for the Judiciary to be vigilant in reviewing the Governor’s and Secretary’s actions to determine if they are constitutional," the representatives said. "The Judiciary should accomplish this objective, in part, by refraining from giving the Governor and Secretary an unduly high level of deference."</p>
<p>The brief was presented in the names of House Speaker Bryan Cutler; Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff; House Majority Whip Donna Oberlander; Chair of the House Appropriations Committee Stan E. Saylor; Chair of the House Majority Caucus Marcy Toepel; Secretary of the House Majority Caucus Mike Reese; Administrator of the House Majority Caucus Kurt Masser; and the Chair of the House Policy Committee Martin Causer.</p>
