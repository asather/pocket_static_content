<h1>Despite injury scares, Pirates’ Kevin Newman, Colin Moran and Keone Kela are available</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The last time the Pirates played, they won, but at a cost. In their 5-4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers, infielders Colin Moran and Kevin Newman both left the game with injuries — Moran with a possible concussion and Newman with lower right abdominal discomfort.</p>
<p>Not that there is ever a good time for these things to happen, the major downside to these particular injuries was that they came as the Pirates’ offense was beginning to heat up.</p>
<p>Then, on Tuesday, when the Pirates released their lineup card for their matchup with the Chicago White Sox, Newman and Moran were not listed. That, as would be natural, could lead to the assumption that Moran and Newman’s apparent injuries were at least relatively serious.</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton, however, clarified that they were with the team and available, but were simply not chosen for now.</p>
<p>“I think we’ll make the assessment if we need them tonight, then we’ll make the assessment with it being a day game tomorrow with what we’re going to do and how they’re feeling and how we’re going,” Shelton said. “It’s just one of those things we’ll kind of play by ear.”</p>
<p>Shelton also lumped closer Keone Kela into the mix with Newman and Moran. Kela left Friday’s game, and he has neither pitched in a game, nor pitched on the side since, Shelton said.</p>
<p>Still, he insisted that, just like Newman and Moran, Kela is available Tuesday if needed.</p>
<p>If the three are good to go, as Shelton says, their absences may be chalked up to an abundance of caution from Shelton and the Pirates. Whether it’s because of the shortened season or the prevalence of injuries the Pirates have already suffered or simply being safe with potential injuries, Shelton isn’t willing to take any risks with these things right now.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve said that kind of from the get-go ... is we want clarity and transparency with everything,” Shelton said. “Obviously, understatement of the year, we’re in such a strange year in terms of timing and health and how it is, so we just want guys to tell us. Like I said the other night with [Kela], as soon as we heard the word tightness, it was, ‘All right, you’re coming out.’ I would rather be on the safe side than be sorry on the other side of it.”</p>
<p><strong>Hayes not on taxi squad, Cederlind is</strong></p>
<p>After Newman and Moran’s apparent injuries, there was a school of thought that, if they had to miss any significant amount of time, it could open the door for the Pirates to call top prospect, third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes to the majors.</p>
<p>With the pair of infielders avoiding the injured list, that call-up isn’t necessary now. However, the Pirates could have, theoretically, brought Hayes along on their current road trip as a member of their taxi squad, the group of players who join the major-league teams on road trips in case of injury or illness.</p>
<p>After all, the Pirates have done that before with some top prospects. Outfielder Jared Oliva joined them earlier this season in that capacity.</p>
<p>Shelton, however, said Hayes was not considered a possibility for the taxi squad this time around.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Pirates did bring right-hander Blake Cederlind along. The right-hander, similarly to Hayes, seemed a possibility for the opening day roster, but that changed when he tested positive for COVID-19 at the start of summer camp.</p>
<p>Recently, he has been medically cleared and working at the alternate training site in Altoona, and now, he is with the Pirates in Chicago. One difference with Cederlind’s inclusion on the taxi squad, however, is that he is not just there as a reward for his hard work or for him to get the opportunity to experience a major-league road trip.</p>
<p>“It’s not to say that it’s not a reward but he’s on for depth and he’s on for [pitching coach Oscar Marin and bullpen coach Justin Meccage] to get a chance to watch him throw and for me to watch him throw,” Shelton said.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Crick still working back</strong></p>
<p>In more injury news, right-handed reliever Kyle Crick has been throwing live batting practice and bullpen sessions in recent days, after being placed on the injured list with a right shoulder strain on July 28.</p>
<p>While that was promising news that may have potentially foretold a return in the near future, Shelton says Crick is not finished ramping back up for the season.</p>
<p>“He will throw another live BP. I’ll let you guys know when that’s going to be,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>Obviously, with the bullpen injuries the Pirates have suffered, they will welcome Crick back with open arms whenever he is available. Apparently, though, that time has not quite arrived yet.</p>
