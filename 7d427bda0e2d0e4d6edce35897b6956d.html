<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Some good news from Rostrum Records: Mac Miller's “K.I.D.S.,” his breakout mixtape, is available on streaming services for the first time.</p>
<p>The collection, released in August 2010, when the Point Breeze rapper was 18, includes early standouts like “Kool Aid &amp; Frozen Pizza,” “Nikes On My Feet" and "Knock Knock” and is accompanied by a collection of never-before-seen images of Miller by Rex Arrow, with whom Miller collaborated on his most iconic videos.</p>
<p>“K.I.D.S.” was Miller's first release with the Pittsburgh-based Rostrum Records, whose founder, Benjy Grinberg, met Miller while working with fellow Allderdice grad Wiz Khalifa. Miller went on to top the charts the following year with debut album&nbsp;“Blue Slide Park.”</p>
