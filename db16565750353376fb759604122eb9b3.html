<h1>Tavian Dunn-Martin continues to give Duquesne spark after move to the bench</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tavian Dunn-Martin’s new role isn’t really a new role at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After starting the first 12 games of Duquesne’s season, coach Keith Dambrot opted to pull junior guard Dunn-Martin from the starting lineup and use him as a weapon off the bench instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what Dunn-Martin did all of last season, en route to winning the Atlantic 10’s Sixth Man of the Year award, averaging 7.8 points per game and finishing second on the team with 81 assists.</p>
<p>This season, the experiment has been shorter, with Dunn-Martin coming off the bench for the last four games, but it has worked. He has scored 11.5 points per game over that span, and the Dukes have won all four contests.</p>
<p>“I feel more comfortable,” Dunn-Martin said Tuesday.&nbsp;“It allows me to play my game. Just coming off the bench, it gives everybody a spark, so that’s what I try to do.”</p>
<p>Of course, for this type of thing to work, Dunn-Martin has to feel that way.</p>
<p>For many, a move from the starting lineup to the bench would be seen as a demotion or a punishment. That could have been especially true in this case, since Dunn-Martin’s move came immediately following Duquesne’s two straight losses to UAB and Marshall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It helps that Dunn-Martin’s minutes haven’t dropped off since the move. His first game coming off the bench this season, against Saint Louis, he tied his season high for minutes played with 32.</p>
<p>What’s more is that Dambrot and Dunn-Martin both understand that the Dukes need the junior guard to produce for them to be successful. Dunn-Martin has taken and made the most 3-pointers on the team. His 37.2% clip from 3, which paces his team, is important for a Duquesne squad that has struggled a bit from beyond the arc, shooting just 31.7% as a whole.</p>
<p>“Tavian’s a pretty statistically good 3-point shooter, so I think he’s coming to his averages,” Dambrot said.&nbsp;“But I do think coming off the bench allows him to play a little bit looser. It allows him to come in to shoot it and not worry about anything, really. So I think it’s a combination, but I think mostly he’s hitting his averages.”</p>
<p>The other positive facet of Dunn-Martin’s game is his energy. He’s the type of guy you see celebrating with his teammates after made buckets, keeping things upbeat.</p>
<p>Just last week, he and freshman wing Maceo Austin were caught posing for the camera while Carry was taking free throws.</p>
<p>While that was an extreme case of keeping things light, Dunn-Martin’s attitude certainly has its benefits.</p>
<p>“I just try to bring good, happy energy around the guys,” Dunn-Martin said.&nbsp;“That’s what I try to do every day.”</p>
<p>It all adds up to a successful formula. What some would consider a relegation is a move back to a comfort zone for Dunn-Martin. His teammates appreciate it, too. They’re supportive of Dunn-Martin in whatever role he fills because they know what he’s capable of on the court.</p>
<p>Added guard Sincere Carry:&nbsp;“He gives us a spark. He can score from anywhere on the court. He can shoot the ball deep, and he does a great job of driving and dropping it off to the bigs. And also, he pressures the ball good, too. He gives me a rest, too, where I can play the 2 and he can play the 1.”</p>
