<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority on Friday confirmed a fourth employee tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The employee was a bus driver who worked at the East Liberty garage, and the driver has not been at work since Thursday, authority officials said.&nbsp;The employee had been on “light duty” since Feb.12.</p>
<p>No other information about the driver would be given to&nbsp;“protect the employee’s identity,” a <a href="https://www.portauthority.org/inside-Port-Authority/News/News-Releases/" target="_blank">release</a> from the authority said.</p>
<p>When the employee reported the positive test, Port Authority conducted a deep cleaning of the East Liberty garage and any buses the driver would have come into contact with.</p>
<p>Buses have been disinfected on a daily basis since March 14.</p>
<p>The case was&nbsp;“confidentially” reported to the Allegheny County Health Department, a release said.</p>
<p>All four Port Authority employees who tested positive for the novel coronavirus have been bus drivers. Bus operators make up around 1,300 of the authority’s 2,600 employees.&nbsp;</p>
