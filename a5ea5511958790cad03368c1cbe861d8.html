<h1>Robert Morris' late comeback, overtime heroics edge Wagner in first round of NEC Tournament</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With 14 seconds left, the Robert Morris women’s basketball team needed a basket to save its season.</p>
<p>The Colonials, who only lost one Northeast Conference game all season, trailed by two points to Wagner Monday in the quarterfinals of the conference tournament at UPMC Events Center. So they turned to junior guard Nina Augustin, who drove with her left hand into the lane and put home a tying layup with seven seconds remaining to force overtime.</p>
<p>Senior center Nneka Ezeigbo made the big play in the extra session, hitting an and-one layup with 1:22 to go and adding the free throw for good measure, to give the Colonials a 61-56 lead.</p>
<p>The Seahawks answered with a 3-pointer, but Augustin made her mark once again moments later, sinking an elbow jumper to put the lead back at four with 15 seconds left. Augustin made two late free throws after that to put the game away, finishing with eight points, and Robert Morris (23-7) survived, 65-61.</p>
<p>“It’s very tough that somebody has to lose a game like today’s,” Colonials coach Charlie Buscaglia said after the game. “I give Wagner a ton of credit. They really worked hard, and it’s just really unfortunate that someone has to lose when a team plays that hard. But it is the way it is, and it stings, and I tip my hat to them in how hard they played. They really pushed us to the limit in all aspects, and we had to be really good down the stretch to be able to pull that game off, and I’m very proud of our group.”</p>
<p>Late in the fourth quarter, it was clear the Colonials were going to have to pull themselves together to keep their conference tournament championship hopes alive.</p>
<p>Wagner guard Khaleah Edwards hit a 3-pointer from the right corner with four minutes to go, putting her team up, 54-50. The rest of the way, the Colonials got the stops they needed, but their offense lagged behind. Robert Morris got to the free-throw line, but went 2 for 6 down the stretch in regulation.</p>
<p>It took some free-throw misses from Wagner and Augustin’s clutch layup to push the game to overtime.</p>
<p>“We were just working on it, so I was more confident and comfortable taking it,” Augustin said of her layup after the game. “They were trusting me, and they told me, ‘Just go. Just go.’ So there was no hesitation.”</p>
<p>Even before the late stages of the game, it was clear it would be a fight. With nine minutes left in the third quarter, Robert Morris trailed by six, but caught fire behind junior center Irekpitan Ozzy-Momodu, who finished with 13 points and eight rebounds, going on a 17-4 run to seize momentary control.</p>
<p>In the first half, the Colonials led for less than four minutes in the first quarter before falling into a deficit for the rest of the first half.</p>
<p>In fact, late in the second quarter, the Seahawks held a seven-point lead, their largest of the game. That was thanks in large part to tough defense, when Wagner limited Robert Morris’ lethal inside game by doubling the post and forcing Colonials other than Ozzy-Momodu and Ezeigbo, who finished with 16 points and 12 rebounds, to beat them.</p>
<p>“There were a lot of arms around me, so I had to adjust and trust that my teammates would be there kicking out, or just be strong around the basket,” Ezeigbo said.</p>
<p>Robert Morris found some offensive life late in the half, as it put together a quick 7-0 run to tie the score after that, highlighted by a big 3-pointer from sophomore guard Isabella Posset, but it still trailed, 29-26 at the half.</p>
<p>The Colonials simply battled from there, leading by as many as eight points, before falling behind late. Luckily for Robert Morris, Augustin, and Ezeigbo after her, hit shots at the right time to ensure the Colonials a spot in the semifinals.</p>
<p>Fifth-seeded Sacred Heart (13-17) defeated host No. 4 Saint Francis, 73-70, in another quarterfinal, meaning the Pioneers are next for the Colonials at 7 p.m. Thursday at UPMC Events Center. The Colonials defeated the Pioneers twice in the regular season, 73-43 and 67-38.</p>
<p>Mount St. Mary’s (20-11) and Fairleigh Dickinson (13-17) meet in the other semifinal Thursday in Emmitsburg, Md.</p>
