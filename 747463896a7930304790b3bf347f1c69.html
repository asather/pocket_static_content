<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police are investigating the Friday death of a state prison inmate in Fayette County as a possible suicide.</p>
<p>David Irby, 31, was pronounced dead around 12:20 a.m. at Uniontown Hospital.</p>
<p>A corrections officer making rounds at&nbsp;State Correctional Institution Fayette found Irby unconscious in his cell, the prison said in a news release.</p>
<p>Officers gave first aid until the prison’s medical staff arrived, and Irby was taken by ambulance to the hospital.</p>
<p>“They are Investigating it as a suicide,” Trooper Robert Broadwater, a Pennsylvania State Police spokesman, said Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trooper Broadwater did not have details about the circumstances, other than that Irby was the cell’s only occupant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investigating trooper could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Fayette County Coroner Phillip Reilly said he had preliminary information from Irby’s autopsy, but he deferred to state police to release it. He said he was three to four weeks away from having a full report, which will include toxicology results.</p>
<p>Irby, who was convicted in 2010 of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in Carbon County, arrived at SCI Fayette in August. He was sentenced to five years and eight months to 14 years and four months in prison.</p>
<p>Another inmate at the facility died in December.</p>
