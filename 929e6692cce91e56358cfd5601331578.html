<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, I’m at the NFL combine and I’ll be ready for questions in about 15 minutes so get ready.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, I see we have a lot of questions already locked and loaded so lets get started.....Go!!</p>
<p><strong>YinzerinVA</strong>: Gerry thanks for hosting! As of right now, who would be the starting 5 offensive lineman that protect Ben next season and get a run game going? This group has to improve for the offense to better... right? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: As of right now, left to right on your radio dial -- Villanueva, Finney, Pouncey, DeCastro, Fieler.</p>
<p><strong>Anujdjango</strong>: Hypothetical: TE Adam Trautman and WR Justin Jefferson are both available at pick 49. Which do the Steelers take, or do they go another direction? Personally, I think they should go defense. Because thats what wins championships. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They don’t need any immediate help on defense, in case you haven’t been paying attention, so given those two options they would take Jefferson.</p>
<p><strong>steelerburrito</strong>: Hey Gerry, It seems to me that in the past few years, our receivers do not get open. Ben had to throw into many tight windows even when AB was still there. I see other teams and so many wide open receivers. Your Opinion? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I doubt you are watching every play of every game in the NFL, so I suspect you’re only seeing the highlights of other teams. And that’s usually why they are the highlights -- someone got wide open to make a big catch or TD. That being said, I do think the Steelers need to do a better job offensively of finding ways to get more space for their WRs, whether with motion, misdirection or whatever.</p>
<p><strong>Hendershot</strong>: Gerry, Does the lack of media and social presence this off season with JuJu Smith-Schuster mean he has his head down getting healthier and is working harder to have a better 2020? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Either that or he is running low on You Tube content possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Steelers GM</strong>: Gerry, I’m about to make the Steelers 1st pick in the 2nd Round. WR Justin Jefferson from LSU is still on the board. Should I take him? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I wouldn’t object unless his more famous teammate, Joe Burrow, were still available.</p>
<p><strong>412 Fanatic</strong>: Love the chats Gerry, do you think the Steelers will target an outside linebacker before a DT to replace Hargrave? Colbert mentioned it being a good OLB draft <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It wouldn’t surprise me, depending of which player might be available, but all things being equal I think their preference is to get a defensive lineman, either as a replacement if Hargrave leaves or just to provide better depth, something that is lacking.</p>

<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Good Morning Gerry. Hope you guys get a chance to hit St Elmos while in Indy.<br> Question is, if presented choice between Tee Higgins or Jonathan Taylor @ Pick 49 which direction do you think they would lean (obviously still lots of data to gather in the process.) <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes, still lots to be gleaned, but right now, if it’s up to me, I take Taylor. I think he’s more NFL-ready and more of a Steelers back to me.</p>
<p><strong>Stillerz</strong>: Hey Gerry, what type of receiver do you think the Steelers will target in this coming draft? Seems like we are lacking a WR with true game breaking speed, but we know Ben likes a bigger guy to target. Would Hamler or Reagor be options despite being so small? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Hamler is a playmaker, and that’s what the Steelers need. You don’t lose playmakers like 84 and 26 and not miss them. So I wouldn’t object at all.</p>
<p><strong>NC Yinzer</strong>: I see a lot of people say we need a WR which confuses me. We have JuJu, Washington, Johnson who are going into their 4th, 3rd and 2nd pro seasons. They started out slow, JuJu had a lost year but I feel like with more competent QB play this group is fine, the biggest need appears to be at TE and OL. That being said, who are the top TE’s in the draft and might one be available in the 2nd or 3rd round? Thanks! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It’s not so much that they NEED a wide receiver, but they need to find more firepower for their offense. It’s a big draft year for WRs and that’s the best place to find firepower. But, yes, they need a tight end to pair with 89, though I think you will see them try to address that in free agency. I see the Falcons have said they will let Austin Hooper test the free agent market. I’d be making a call.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna</strong>: Gerry about a month ago on a question chat you answered to go offense offense offense at 49, Let me ask you this: if a defense stud is at 49 and no doubt is BPA 1st rd grade, if it was your call or would you take a 2nd rd grade offense position? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: 1) That’s a hypothetical, and I stay away from those; 2) There won’t be a defensive STUD in the second round (if he’s a stud, he’ll be gone); 3) They have more glaring needs on offense than any position on defense.</p>
<p><strong>Yinzer</strong>: Hey Ger, which of the top 3 runningbacks (swift, dobbins, Taylor) do you think the Steelers would prefer most? I would think Swift, then dobbins, then Taylor, Taylor’s fumbling problem seems very concerning <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I agree with Swift, but Dobbins size is not in their DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Steely Dan</strong>: Gerry, do you believe Steelers will be more likely to target guard or tackle this draft? Seems to be we would be foolish to push Feiler back inside when he was so good at tackle, is Chuks a viable guard option? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There are fewer options at guard, so I’d say guard for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Diontae Johnson</strong>: What do you think my stat line will look like next year with a full offseason and having Big Ben under center? I’m smelling a pro bowl... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think you’re getting thrown off by another scent...</p>
<p><strong>Yinzer</strong>: Have you heard anything about the progression of Justin Layne? Could he push Hilton/Sutton for any snaps? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Sure. But they’ll find that out in training camp.</p>
<p><strong>section 115</strong>: love the enthusiasm from KC, but better at 38 and major surgery? cmon. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think Colbert’s point was, maybe Ben’s arm was bothering more than he let on before he was even injured and that it’s possible, with surgery, his arm will be better to start 2020 than it was to start 2019. There is no medical way his elbow will be better after surgery than it was when it was normal (pre-injury). That is not possible. But maybe this will help compensate for the normal wear and tear a 16-year QB will endure with his throwing elbow. That’s what he means.</p>
<p><strong>Yinzer</strong>: How high is the staff on Devin Bush? Will he be on the field 100% next season, seemed to fade a bit down the stretch <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Higher than the legal limit</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: I simple don’t understand all the talk about drafting a nose tackle early. With Tuitt coming back and the Steelers playing sub D 70% of the time taking a defensive lineman is a waste unless it’s after the 3rd round. Also if they sigh Dupree why take a linebacker. Honestly why does anyone think they would take anything but a player who can help them score points with their top picks or any free agents. Are fans that silly? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I suggest that wherever you are reading that or hearing that you find a new spot for your information.</p>
<p><strong>MTScott</strong>: Do you think Ben might play one more year than previously planned since he didn’t have much wear &amp; tear from last year - assuming his elbow issues are behind him?! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I do not. I think he will play out his contract and call it quits after the 2021 season, even if he returns to close to full health.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: If nfl draft safeties Davis or Winfield or ILB Kenneth Murray, any of the 3 available at first pick would you take them if they available and take skill Offensive players later? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I can promise you there will be no safety taken with a top pick. And my second guarantee is there will be no ILB taken with ANY pick.</p>
<p><strong>MTScott</strong>: With the new CBA, I saw where rosters would expand from 53 to 55, but does the game day actives increase also?! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’m not sure of that. Have to check.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Gerry, Is the NFL going the route of MLB with the CBA? Greed killed competitive baseball with just a handful of teams able to spend to get the best players. Hopefully NFL owners are smarter than that. Thank you. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There is no comparison between the NFL and MLB when it comes to financial structure. None whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>Robert</strong>: At a cost of over 30 million dollars per year Ben Roethlisberger has got to deliver winning performance for the Steelers. Failure in this regard for the Steelers is not an option. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: And your question is...??</p>
<p><strong>MTScott</strong>: Could Vince Willams be used as a backup OLB now that his time at ILB has been greatly reduced? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Tprod</strong>: Gerry, how do you feel about the Steelers draft philosophy of drafting the best available player at a position of need vs drafting the best available player.? The former has led to some notable reaches including Jarvis Jones, Artie Burns and Terrell Edmunds. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Those weren’t reaches. They were what you said -- drafting best player at position of need.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Gerry - do you know when the Steelers will find out about getting a 3rd round compensatory pick for L Bell? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well all league business has been and will continue to be delayed because of the CBA agreement between the owners and players union that is waiting to be ratified. So you might have to wait a while. Typically, that would have occurred last week.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Gerry - do the Steelers see Zach Banner as a guy that can compete with Chuks for RT if they move Feiler to G or do you think they see him as a nice backup? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t think so, but you never know.</p>
<p><strong>Bills22</strong>: Hey Gerry, any chance the Steelers release Ramon Foster, and then resign him to a min vets contract? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There’s always a chance, but don’t run to the casino with the odds....</p>
<p><strong>Tprod</strong>: Gerry, Teams have countered the emphasis on passing by fielding faster, quicker LBs, no Moore Levantine Kirkland. Teams no are countering with a power running game between the tackles aimed at these lighter LB with success. Vince Williams played only about 30% of the snaps and Bush and Barron made most of their tackles more than 4 yards downfield. How do the Steelers respond? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Say three Our Fathers and three ......</p>
<p><strong>Zavry Goulden</strong>: On SNR you, and Dale discussed the Steelers taking a skill player (RB, WR) at pick #49. Who are some of the top skill guys you think will still be on the board? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think there is a chance RBs like JTaylor and Cam Akers could still be available, WRs like Michael Pittman, and really any of the top TEs.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Why all the love for Durpee? I just don’t get it. now we are talking about wanting him to be a steeler long term? Who was the last Steeler or any player for that matter you commit to long term after one good (not great) year? Maybe we can retire his number next!! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You forgot the Hall of Honor. I wouldn’t start worrying about a long-term deal. KC said the thing about LeV Bell when they put the franchise tag or him -- that they wanted him to retire as a Steeler -- and how did that work out.</p>
<p><strong>Zavry Goulden</strong>: Which skill guys do you think will be available at pick 49? Do you think that RB or WR is more likely? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It is a deep draft for WRs so, yes, there should be some quality there with the 49th pick.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: What is the chance will keep Hargraves? I think he is very important to this defense, your thoughts. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He is, but not as important as Heyward and Tuitt. I think he will get a decent offer in free agency and the Steelers will elect not to match it.</p>
<p><strong>Alex</strong>: Don’t you think it would be wise to get a veteran back-up to the QB position just in case Ben has IR issue again. It’s obvious that our current back-up’s are not going to get us into the play-offs. Thank you <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: And you think signing some veteran QB will get them there...??</p>
<p><strong>Coach</strong>: Mike Tomlin is the Steelers coach this time next year yes or no? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes. And in 2021 too</p>
<p><strong>Munrow</strong>: Hello Gerry, Do you see us going after Hooper in free agency? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They should. He’s available now.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona Guy</strong>: Should I worry about getting tickets or plan on just walking up the day of the game <br> <strong>Arizona Guy</strong>: Jerry I am planning on coming to PNC to watch some Pirate games this June (I know crazy huh?) <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Walk up will be perfectly fine.</p>
<p><strong>Doug from Raleigh</strong>: Why so much national media disrespect if not outright hate for Ben? 10 or so years ago he had some sketchy moments, but by all accounts a good dad and better teammate than some suggest. And stop with the FAT comments, he had on bulky clothes and has big gnarly beard. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Membership in the Moron Club is limitless</p>
<p><strong>steelersfaninct</strong>: with the cba.. it would go from 46 to 48 active on game day. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I believe you are correct</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Gerry, Don’t you think that this NFL combine is over-hyped. Other than interviews and physicals the individual pro days are much better? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yep</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Last year we hear all the talk that Tomlin might of had one of his best seasons last year. I find it crazy that the Steelers had to play a few games with a QB like Hodges in the middle of a playoff run. Once Ben went down early in the season how or why didn’t Tomlin and company look to pickup a vet QB in case Mason stumbled or got injured. If we had any capable QB we most likely don’t lose 3 games to end the year and we make the playoffs. I coach baseball and one of my pitchers just had surgery yesterday on his shoulder. I started making phone calls to fill in for him months ago once I heard about his surgery. I just can’t believe the Steelers didn’t see how life would be without capable backups. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: So, then, good thing you found that backup pitcher and didn’t rely on them to do it for you....?</p>
<p><strong>Alex</strong>: Hi Gerry, Do you have any insight into the contract negotiations with Bud DuPree? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There are no negotiations, only a matter of when they can use the franchise tag. That was supposed to be able to happen yesterday but everything has been delayed because of the CBA stuff</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: Why are people saying Ben looks huge? I think he looked GREAT considering he hasn’t played since week 2, and he’s always been a big, hard-to-bring-down QB....<br>Are they just haters? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Just complainers</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Could Vince Williams get released for cap savings <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I wouldn’t discount it.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: When do you anticipate salary cap cuts to be made? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Dont know now</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: could the team try to pick up a free agent back and TE. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: More than likely a free-agent TE.</p>
<p><strong>AA</strong>: How would you compare the step down in quality from a team’s starting QB to the backup vs. other positions. It seems to me that it’s much bigger. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Some times, some places, it is, only because the position is so important. Look, teams are having a hard enough time finding their starting quarterback, let alone a quality backup.</p>
<p><strong>Highland Steeler</strong>: appreciate your chats Gerry - hate to lose Hargraves but I believe a cheaper more traditional NT ( Billings , Damon Harrison ) allows for more 2nd and longs . That should help improve our defense immediately. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t know that the defense will be improved if they lose Hargrave, but it won’t be devastated by any means. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ok kids, I have to go run the 40, so we’re out of time. Thanx for the questions.</p>
