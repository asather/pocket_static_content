<h1>Mike White's high school sports chat transcript: 03.10.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Mike White</strong>: Sorry for delay in getting started. Let’s do.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Are any WPIAL teams winning a state title this year? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Someone will. Best chances are probably in girls. Class 1A boys maybe with Vincentian although Vincentian is playing No. 2 team in state tonight. WPIAL boys would win two at very most, but wouldn’t surprise if they won only one or none.</p>
<p><strong>Leopard Fan</strong>: Hey Mike, what do you think of Belle Vernon’s chances tonight against Lancaster Catholic? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Don’t know a ton about Lancaster Catholic except that they’re 24-3 and supposed to be good. I’d pick Lancaster.</p>
<p><strong>GH</strong>: Will the Chartiers Valley girls basketball team ever lose? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Maybe in, like, 2022-23 season. No seriously, I expect them to win state again but they will definitely get challenged at some point. Doubt it will be tonight when they will break WPIAL record for longest winning streak. It will be 57th win. But TJ is still out there. Remember CV beat TJ by one point earlier this season. But I don’t know if people really realize what CV is doing. 56 in a row? Are you kidding? AND THEY START FOUR SOPHOMORES. Incredible.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Mike, were you surprised that all the WPIAL 5A boys teams got wiped out in the 1st round? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Not really. I said all year that Class 5A in WPIAL wasn’t as good as it used to be. A little watered down this year. I think Mars definitely wins if it has Carmody. Teams that WPIAL lost to are pretty good. I think Obama proved something by beating Allderdice in City League championship. Laurel Highlands was a great story in winning WPIAL. Not downplaying LH, but they weren’t a great team. No on in WPIAL 5A was.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Does Vincentian have a clean path to the State Finals? Any opponents out there that could offer them a challenge other than Sankofa Freedom? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: As I said above, Vincentian plays Berlin Brothersvalley tonight. One of greatest school names in state, right? Well, BB is ranked No. 2 in state in Class 1A behind Vincentian. BB is good. I’d still pick Vincentian, though. As for Sankofa Freedom, they are 8-14. I don’t know if they will get there.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Mike, I have no problem with the Carmody suspension in terms of a teaching lesson for kids, but I also feel WPIAL made an example out of the kid because he’s well known and it was in a championship game. Ya mean no other kids throughout the year have done similarly immature things throughout WPIAL? Why just him? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: This is a touchy situation and I have opinions on both sides. I don’t think the suspension was just because of WPIAL championship game. WPIAL even said another incident earlier this year vs. Shaler played into decision. I understand the one game suspension. I think two was too much. Only thing is this. Carmody was not thrown out of game. His actions came after the game, yes. But what about in future? Will WPIAL listen to any school now that comes to them with video of poor sportsmanship from a game, say, in mid-December.?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Two district 5 v. district 7 matchups in A Boys Basketball, can any of the D5 teams compete with these powerhouses? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I talked about Berlin Brothersvalley a couple times above. Yes, they can compete with Vincentian.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Who do u think will win butler or usc <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I wish I knew how bad Ethan Morton’s sprained ankle was. That will mean a lot. He hurt it again Saturday. He’s been getting treatment on it non stop. I have not been told this, but I don’t think he’ll be 100 percent. He does so much for that team. If you make me choose without knowing that, I guess I would go with Butler. But as you can see from last game, this game is a total tossup. A key will be USC’s shooting. They will be getting shots against Butler zone.</p>
<p><strong>Bigdog</strong>: What are your thoughts on a Butler state championship? Do you think they have the pieces to do it? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: They better worry about USC in second round before anything. And teams from east are very good. Roman, Methacton. Some real talent there. Butler would not be favored.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Baldwin girls winning it all. Cinderella story <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Please stop.</p>
<p><strong>WPIAL fan</strong>: Do you anticipate a sellout for Butler-USC tomorrow night? Great move that it’s now at RMU. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well here is news flash. Just found out about 10 minutes before chat started: BUTLER VS. UPPER ST. CLAIR GAME HAS BEEN MOVED TO ROBERT MORRIS’ UPMC EVENTS CENTER!!!!! Nice. Will be plenty of seats available. Story is on Post-Gazette web site. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Repeating: BUTLER VS. UPPER ST. CLAIR GAME WEDNESDAY HAS BEEN MOVED TO ROBERT MORRIS’ UPMC EVENTS CENTER.</p>
<p><strong>6a Fan</strong>: Hi Mike, just ready your piece on Carney and man has he been unbelievable. I think when it comes to the fab 5 this year, obviously Morton is the clear first name off the board and the clear player of the year. That being said, Carney has to be second. Is he flawed, does he like to shoot it to much? Sure. He very well might be the most SKILLED scorer the WPIAL has ever seen. <br> <br> Not from his camp, just wanted to point out it would be a travesty were he to be left off. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Good lord! “Most skilled scorer WPIAL has ever seen.” .... Please. Let’s just stop at that ludicrous statement. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Devin Carney will certainly be considered for Fab 5. So will a number of other players. He’s very good offensively. So are other players. We look at whole body of work.</p>
<p><strong>Howard Stern</strong>: Mike, what’s your favorite gym to visit that is outside of the WPIAL (not the Giant Center) to cover a PIAA playoff game? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Sharon is old and has a lot of history. I’ve been to Farrell’s gym also. It’s old but has a great nostalgic feel to it. History all around that place. Honestly I haven’t been in many gyms in Eastern Pa. In fact, I don’t know if I’ve been in one in Eastern Pa.</p>
<p><strong>Chief2178</strong>: Looking back at the 1989 Boys 4A Western Basketball Bracket won by Brashear 12 of the 15 Games were played at college venues (1st Round Peabody hosted 1 game and Chartiers Valley hosted double header). Would be nice if more college venues hosted games the closer games got to the state finals in Hershey. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, I remember Brashear’s 1989 run - with Fred Kerr at point (signed with SMU) and football star Mike Booth playing enforcer. Elmer Guckert coach and Fred Yee assistant, who both won state titles. Brashear lost to Chester in state final that year. Back then, lots of games were played at Robert Morris’ Sewall Center. For whatever reason at some point a while ago, Robert Morris wasn’t very interested in hosting games any more. Rent might have been too high. And WPIAL started using Palumbo much more for many rounds. Then something happened there. I don’t think Palumbo was crazy about hosting games any more. Yes, it would be nice for colleges to host games. But the college has to be willing. And it can’t be too costly to WPIAL and PIAA.</p>
<p><strong>D9 Dave</strong>: Don’t you think that the WPIAL should determine lower seeds on the court rather than using the follow the leader concept? Take 4A for instance, it would seem to me that both Quaker Valley and Knoch were better teams than Ringgold who was the 5 seed only because Highlands won it &amp; they lost to Highlands in the quarterfinal round. It makes more sense and is more fair to have the 4 quarterfinal losers play to determine the 5 seed. Would not detract from the rest of the tournament either in my opinion. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Most definitely I wish they played it out on the court. They did it for a couple years recently and then stopped again. I wish they would go back.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: It says on the Piaa bracket that butler usc plays at Robert Morris <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, read above. They just moved it to Robert Morris this morning.</p>
<p><strong>BT</strong>: What are your thoughts on North Catholic-Aliquippa match up? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Should be good game. Aliquippa can play with them but I’ll still go North Catholic.</p>
<p><strong>Ace</strong>: All the talk about sites for WPIAL championships, what about PPG Pain’ts Arena? Parking would be better than Pitt. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, would be great. But two reasons it won’t be there. PPG can’t guarantee three days ahead of time because they don’t have Penguins schedule for years ahead of time - and WPIAL doesn’t want to split games at different places. Again, it has to be cost effective also.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Where are all these good Vincentian players going to end up? They should be able to transfer anywhere, private or public, and not sit out right? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I have no idea where they will end up. Alex Griggs is from Hampton. I think one or two are from NA. Not sure where Boom Reeves is from. And yes, the rule is they can transfer and be eligible for everything when school closes. However, if it’s public school, they must attend public school where they live, or a charter school (which is public). They can also go to a private school if they want and be eligible. Will be interesting. Lot of non-seniors on that team.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Vincentian Vs Berlin today. Va is #1 in state and Berlin is top 3. Who do you have winning ? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Talked about it above. Berlin Brothersvalley is good and can play with Vincentian, but I’ll still take Vincentian. Will size matter?</p>
<p><strong>ronald</strong>: Would Vincentian winning states in its last year be one of the stories of the year in PIAA basketball? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Corner of 5th and Neville</strong>: Dice Coach Devine clearly didn’t have his kids ready against USC - let alone Obama. Balinsky built that program on defensive intensity and there was none this year. Any chance the dragons make a change at the helm? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You need to make a change with your names. Coach Devine at Allderdice? What did Dan Devine come back from Notre Dame? His name is Devin Crummie. And Balinsky? I guess they used to play Balinsky ball. I guess you’re talking about old coach. His name was Buddy Valinsky. And Allderdice was still pretty good this year I must say.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: Has there ever been a discussion by the WPIAL to let the different classifications champions play against each other for an overall champion, kind of a Hossier’s scenario? There are several boys games and at least one girls game that would be worth the price of admission. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You’re talking about the New Jersey “Tournament of Champions.” They do it with state champions, not district champions. And no, the PIAA has never seriously discussed this. Might be nice, but it ain’t happening.</p>
<p><strong>6a Fan</strong>: How is that ludicrous? Who was more skilled? Scores from all three levels. Ridiculous handle. Footwork is unmatched. Lets just look at the last decade? Some of the best scorers: Morton, Mason, TJ, Matty, Carmody, Cummings, Hooker, etc... None of them are more skilled then Carney when it comes to scoring. Can score more due to there size and athleticism sure. But none are more skilled. Tell me, technically speaking, how that is ludicrous.... <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You’re right. Brain cramp. What was I thinking? Devin Carney is undoubtedly the most skilled scorer IN THE HISTORY OF WPIAL BASKETBALL!!!! I mean, how could he not be? A kid averaging 21.5 points a game is way ahead of guys who have made the NBA, have averaged more than 30 a game in high school, have broken scoring records in high school, have gone on to make major impacts at major colleges, gone on to play in FInal 4s .... I have no idea what was wrong with me? Devin Carney is better than all of them.</p>
<p><strong>RT 51</strong>: Mike- Huge upset for BW girls. Just checked them out for first time very young roster. You have any scouting report for next round? <br> <strong>ronald</strong>: Would Vincentian winning states be wpial bball story of the year? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Haven’t really thought about what is “story of the year.” <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: It’s not like Vincentian was some big surprise winning WPIAL. Just because their school is closing makes it the best story of the year in WPIAL basketball?</p>
<p><strong>Mike in BP</strong>: New superintendent coming in BP. Maybe they’ll finally realize it’s a good thing to show off your almost-new gymnasium that everyone loves. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I really don’t know why Bethel hasn’t been used.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Radzyminski</strong>: What are your thoughts on the Mohawk Lady Warriors? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: They are WPIAL champs. Obvioulsy a good team. Good story with them winning a WPIAL title. Impressed most by their shooting. They were averaging 11 3-pointers a game heading into WPIAL finals. That is something else.</p>
<p><strong>The Alley</strong>: Who is the best player in WPIAL Class A <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don’t think there is one great standout in Class 1A. Made me choose, I might have to say Boom Reeves.</p>
<p><strong>Gball</strong>: Mike, How soon will it be that North Catholic is the loan remaining Catholic School in the WPIAL? If Vincentian can’t survive in the heart of the North Hills, how many will? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Ahhh, I think you’re forgetting about that place in the heart of Oakland. Central Catholic isn’t going anywhere. I don’t think Seton LaSalle or OLSH isn’t going anywhere either.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Tornado</strong>: I hear Morton is good to go for tomorrow for Butler. Move to UPMC Center to accommodate more Butler fans gives advantage to Butler. Also Carney is improving every game. Butler by double digits? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: How in the world does the move to Robert Morris give advantage to Butler? You’ve got me there. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Questions about USC-Butler site still coming in. AGAIN, LOOK ABOVE: BUTLER VS. USC HAS BEEN MOVED TO ROBERT MORRIS.</p>
<p><strong>The USC fan</strong>: Mike what happened at Allderdice this year? I would have never in a million years thought Id be happy to see us draw them in the playoffs but boy was I ever? Any truth to the rumor that the old coach put Crummie up for the job in a lobbying effort to land the Central spot? If so that back fired on everyone smh sad <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Devin Crummie wasn’t getting the Central job. Your logic is flawed. Allderdice was still good this year. They lost to a better team in the state playoffs -- Upper St. Clair.</p>
<p><strong>The Alley</strong>: Have you seen Berlin play this year Mike, or going with they are good based upon the state rankings? Just wondering how a small country school has enough athletes to legitimately compete with VA <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I have not seen Berlin Brothersvalley play. Going by what I’ve been told, reports on them, how good they were last year, looking at their players and their scores. I did not say Berlin would win. I said they can play with Vincentian. Cornell played with Vincentian. Beat Vincentian. Nazareth Prep did OK. It can be done.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Are any WPIAL teams remaining in states on the brink of getting reclassified if they progress to certain point? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Only one left that it would affect is OLSH.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Mike, do you know what number is gonna hit tonight? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, call my 1-900 line for that info.</p>
<p><strong>The Commissioner</strong>: The story of Butler vs. USC in WPIAL playoffs was the poor officiating at the end of the game. Any clue if the WPIAL or Officials Rep. commented on the controversial calls at the end? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: There are no two minute reports from the league office in the WPIAL or PIAA. This isn’t the NBA. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Hey that’s about it for now. Second round of playoffs tonight and tomorrow. Quarterfinals Friday and Saturday. Go out and see a game. It’s great time of year. Everyone, be good.</p>
