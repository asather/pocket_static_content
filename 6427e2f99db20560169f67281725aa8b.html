<h1>McGuffey slips past Wash High in sloppy opener</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It would have been poetic to say Washington and McGuffey played an old-fashioned grudge match, with neither team giving an inch.</p>
<p>That both battled in the trenches with 3 yards and a cloud of dust deciding the game.</p>
<p>Sound nostalgic. But that was far from the truth.</p>
<p>In all honesty, McGuffey and Washington muddled through a morass of bad penalties, marginal execution and critical mistakes.</p>
<p>In the end, though, Class 2A No. 3-ranked McGuffey made one fewer miscue than No. 2 Washington as a Nate Witkoski extra point proved to be the margin of victory and the Highlanders christened their new gray-turf field with a 7-6 season-opening win against the Little Prexies.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a thing of beauty,” McGuffey coach Ed Dalton said. “But when you’ve got 20 practices in instead of 35 and you haven’t had 7-on-7, there’s a lot of parts to it.”</p>
<p>Washington came into the night riding a 13-game Century Conference winning streak, which dated to a 64-33 loss Aug. 31, 2018, at Charleroi. But the Little Prexies were stymied, by their own mistakes and a Highlanders defense that came up big in the clutch.</p>
<p>“We’re a really inexperienced, young team, we made a lot of mistakes and, it’s not the kids’ fault, but we’re out of shape,” Washington coach Mike Bosnic said. “We’re going to get better every week, and I told the kids that we will get back to work and by the middle of the season we could have a pretty good football team.”</p>
<p>Washington played very well defensively and limited McGuffey to only 157 yards of total offense. But one drive midway through the second half turned the tide and forced the Little Prexies to go into catch-up mode.</p>
<p>After Washington turned it over on downs at the McGuffey 28, the team’s flexbone offense found a hole in the middle of the Little Prexies line and exploited it to the hilt. On a third-and-3 from the 39, McKinley Whipkey wiggled through a crease and scampered up the gut for 27 yards to break the Highlanders out of the hole and give the team some much-needed momentum.</p>
<p>That carry sparked the offense as Whipkey picked up 38 of his 52 yards in the game on the drive. After quarterback Rocco Falosk took it down to the Washington 5 and a Little Prexies offsides penalty moved it to the 2, sophomore Kyle Brookman broke the scoreless tie and helped McGuffey take a 7-0 lead with 3:38 remaining in the third quarter.</p>
<p>“I think we got them a little bit with the formation and gave them a little bit of Paul Johnson and, if you can’t block the box then get somebody out of the box,” Dalton said. “They countered right away. They moved the linebacker over and took it away.”</p>
<p>Washington didn’t have any offense to speak of in the second half and time was running out. But with 10:41 remaining in the game, the Little Prexies found something with Tayshawn Levy, who overcame an early fumble to carry the team to their only score.</p>
<p>Levy carried seven times for 46 yards and capped it off with a 1-yard dive to close the gap to one with 5:40 left. But Washington couldn’t take the lead as quarterback Davoun Fuse collided with the running back, and his scramble to the corner came up short on the 2-point conversion and the Little Prexies remained down, 7-6.</p>
<p>“It was a breakdown,” Bosnc said. “One of our players went the wrong way and it blew the play up.”</p>
<p>Undaunted, Washington forced a three-and-out, and Fuse had a solid punt return to give the Little Prexies the ball at the McGuffey 31 with 2:48 remaining and no timeouts. But on third-and-2 from the 23, Fuse fumbled the snap — the third time in the half the exchange was muffed — and senior defensive lineman Grant Brookman recovered with 1:28 left to end the comeback.</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised with some inexperienced guys, but we’ve got to keep working and we’ve got to get better,” Bosnic said. “I’ve got to do a better job and we going to do that. We’re going to work harder to get better every week.”</p>
