<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One day after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2020/06/10/Top-Republican-Mike-Turzai-will-resign-from-the-Pa-House-on-June-15/stories/202006100111" target="_blank">resigning as speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives</a>, Mike Turzai has been hired as general counsel for Peoples Natural Gas.</p>
<p>The North Shore-based utility, which was acquired by Bryn Mawr-based Essential Utilities Inc. (formerly known as Aqua America), announced the long-rumored appointment on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Turzai, a Republican and native of southwestern Pennsylvania, represented the state’s 28th Legislative District, which encompasses the suburbs in northern Allegheny County, for nearly two decades. A resident of Marshall, he was elected House speaker in 2015.</p>
<p>As a legislator, Mr. Turzai has been a vocal proponent of the shale gas industry and its economic development potential. He held back proposals to impose a severance tax on the gas extraction.</p>
<p>“Mike is well aware of the opportunities and challenges of this growing industry,” said Christopher Luning, executive vice president, general counsel and secretary for Essential Utilities, and Mr. Tuzai’s new boss. “His background and expertise will benefit our customers and the communities we serve.”</p>
<p>Mr. Turzai <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2020/06/10/Top-Republican-Mike-Turzai-will-resign-from-the-Pa-House-on-June-15/stories/202006100111" target="_blank">announced his resignation</a> from the House on Wednesday.</p>
