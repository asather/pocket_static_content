<h1>Pittsburgh rapper JM The Poet speaks his truth on debut album 'Deja Vu'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jay Manning didn’t know what to expect of his creative life when he took a sales job in Pittsburgh four years ago.</p>
<p>During his years studying journalism at Winthrop, the South Carolina native was part of a poetry group and performed as a rapper and spoken-word artist, inspired by personal heroes like Tupac and Outkast.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know much about the scene itself,” he says of Pittsburgh, “but I knew about Wiz, Hardo and Mac before moving here.”</p>
<p>It didn't take long for Manning, who goes by JM The Poet, to find the community here, starting with fellow poet Fred “Fu” Underwood.</p>
<p>“Somebody introduced me to him. He was an Alpha, I was an Alpha, so that was a dope connection, and he immediately brought me in.”</p>
<p>JM did his first showcase at the Canvas of Words at the Kelly Strayhorn Theatre in the summer of 2016, and started to make a name as a poet.</p>
<p>“I was about to quit rap,” he says, “and then I got with 1Hood and it kind of motivated me to get going again with it.”</p>
<p>Through 1Hood Media, the collective of conscious hip-hop artists founded by Jasiri X and Paradise Gray, he hooked up with Livefromthecity and Jordan Montgomery, two of the artists on Montgomery’s Pittsburgh-based label Driving While Black Records.</p>
<p>“I met JM when I was still heavily involved with 1Hood,” Montgomery says, “and we began to develop a mutual respect for each other’s music.”</p>
<p>While they were working on last year’s Driving While Black compilation “Support Black Business,” “JM would always come to the studio and he ended up being featured on every song,” Montgomery says, “His work ethic and energy made me want to bring him on board.”</p>
<p>The result is<a href="https://album.link/i/1529022131" target="_blank"> “Deja Vu,” a debut album</a> that reveals JM The Poet as a deft wordsmith and complex artist with a range from pensive to fierce.</p>
<p>“I called it ‘Deja Vu,’” he says, “because the concept of deja vu is like having the dream turn to real life. I like to say I deja vu my dreams.”</p>
<p>He begins the album stating “Wake up, young king,” which he describes as a call to himself to “wake up and embrace the world, embrace reality, because the world isn’t going to stop spinning and if I keep sleeping I’m going to be left behind.”</p>
<p>The first half of the record, with a mix of energetic songs like “Get Up, Get Right” and “All I Know,” reflects his early days in Pittsburgh when he’s on the grind, motivating himself as a young Black man to take on the world.</p>
<p>“Things were going good,” he says. “I was engaged. I had a good job, a good career with money and everything, but I had lost myself in it. You know, I was having a lot of fun, but I felt like I had lost myself in a sense.”</p>
<p>The album shifts with “Hate,” an spoken interlude about the struggle between Venus and Mars (love and war), and “Intentions,” a somber breakup song teeming with conflicted emotions: “She feel like we heaven / I think we 9-11 / falling, falling down till there’s nothing left,” he sings in a dejected monotone.</p>
<p>“In late 2018, early 2019,” he explains, “I left the job and the relationship broke off, so the whole second half of the album is really the last year and a half of following my own passion and really following my own dreams and trying to make those become reality. So, you hear the breakup track, but then it goes into ‘Beautiful,’ a song about self love. And that's really the first step I had to go through — trying to reset myself, find my self love and figure out what makes me happy.”</p>
<p>Montgomery and Victor Muthama bring some strong male energy to the politically charged “Function”/“Muthama’s Interlude (Function Part 2)” before JM closes the album with the title track (featuring lovely vocal with A’Leighsha) and the hopeful “Diamonds.”</p>
<p>“ ‘Diamonds’ is that culmination of the whole album,” he says, “After all the pressure that I've been under, after everything I've been through, it didn't break me down, but instead made me stronger, turned me into a diamond.”</p>
<p>JM, who is back in journalism as a photographer for PublicSource, points to the bond between the Driving While Black team as the impetus for “Deja Vu.”</p>
<p>“Our friendship and our chemistry, man. Honestly, I haven’t had this much chemistry making music with people in a long time. It’s to the point where Live can hit me up, I can go up to his house and he can just throw on a beat and within 30 minutes, we can have a song done. The chemistry is so there, so on point.”</p>
<p>There are also contributions from $Toney and South Carolina artists Jamahl St. Clair and Kaydence Day, and production from C. Scott, Hobbes Duende, Nori Sky and A-Kxxng.</p>
<p>As for his adjustment to Pittsburgh, which can be a challenging place for young Black men, he says, “I've learned to take the good with the bad and focus more on the positive that I can get from this, not just as a city, but as a situation. I'm doing everything I can in my role to try to fight injustice and things like that, but I'm not gonna let that define my experience. I’ve met good people. I'm not gonna say I’ve had a bad experience here when I met people like Jordan Montgomery and livefromthecity and Jasiri X, my girlfriend, people around me that are making it a good experience.”</p>
