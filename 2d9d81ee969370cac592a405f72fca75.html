<h1>Gene Collier: Death of Bill McVay a rip in Pittsburgh's sports fabric</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Happy Father’s Day to all you dads, or as the great Ralph Kiner once said on a live TV broadcast, “It’s Fathers Day today, so to all you fathers out there, happy birthday!”</p>
<p>Father’s Day tends to sneak up on us sometimes, and even if like Kiner we have a plausible malaprop at the ready, we are granted absolution. Forgot it was Father’s Day? No biggie. The downside comes when Father’s Day arrives with an emotional wallop, anticipated or not.</p>
<p>“We all took him cards last week,” Jim McVay was telling me on the phone this week. “Once he stopped eating, his body was worn out. Father Time’s undefeated.”</p>
<p>For sports fans in particular, and especially people who’ve largely structured their lives around sports, that first Father’s Day without your father can be a disquieting, disorienting jolt. I don’t know if the jolt today is mitigated or aggravated by the stark absence of sports due to the pandemic, but I know this singularly sad kind of Father’s Day can force you into an uncomfortable juxtaposition with life’s ultimate and final irony: death.</p>
<p>Bill McVay died June 8 at 87, surrounded by his loving family the obit said, and sure, 87-year-old dads and sports fans of every description die every day, but Bill McVay’s passing is a different kind of landmark.</p>
<p>“He was just a magnificent Pittsburgher,” former Pirates manager Clint Hurdle told me this week. “He was like a walking Chamber of Commerce. He was always saying, ‘It’s a beautiful day in Pittsburgh.’ He knew every neighborhood and every good place to eat in every neighborhood. I knew he was a huge fan, but I wasn’t even close to an awareness of the full depth of his life.</p>
<p>“I was with him on the field a couple of times, we got him down to throw out a first pitch, and I said to him, ‘Ya know, I’ve been here nine years at 162 games each, and you’ve probably seen more Pirates games than I have.”</p>
<p>That would be correct, as Bill had been a season ticket holder back to Forbes Field, just as he’d been a Steelers season ticket holder back to Pitt Stadium and a Penguins season ticket holder back into the ’80s. He was there in the flesh to see the Pirates win the World Series in 1960, and again in 1971 and 1979 in Baltimore; to see the Steelers win Super Bowls X and XIII in Miami, XL in Detroit, and XLIII in Tampa; and to see the Penguins win the Stanley Cup in Chicago in 1992.</p>
<p>“He flew me in from college for a playoff game in 1990 — Pirates and Reds,” said Jim, who played hockey at Colby College in Maine. “Somehow my face got on national TV, so the next day in class, this Government professor is like, ‘So how well did everybody study last night, and Mr. McVay, how was that game?’</p>
<p>“My dad didn’t want me to miss stuff. It was all about giving to his family and the community. My dad would never make money on tickets. Two of my buddies, for the Detroit Super Bowl, tickets were going for five grand, he sold them for face value to those guys, who could never have gone to that game. He said, ‘I want the real fans to go.’”</p>
<p>Being called a real fan by Bill McVay had to be like being called a real guitarist by Jimi Hendrix.</p>
<p>Bill had a transistor radio in his tuxedo pocket on Aug. 6, 1960, the day he married Sally Provins, his wife for most of the next 60 years. Good thing, too, the Pirates and Giants went extra innings that day according to Baseball Reference, with Frisco scoring twice in the top of the 10th and the Bucs rallying to win it anyway. Bob Prince, Jim Woods, and Paul Long had the call from the groom’s pocket.</p>
<p>In the wedding party that day was Dick Thornburgh, future governor of Pennsylvania, attorney general of the United States, and a classmate of Bill’s at Pitt’s law school. Sally loved to say that Dick told her Bill spent more time at Forbes Field than in the Cathedral of Learning.</p>
<p>A graduate of Mt. Lebanon High and Allegheny College prior to Pitt Law, McVay built a career as a partner at McArdle, McLaughlin, Paletta, and McVay, where for some 30 years he was the designated counsel for the United Transportation Union, representing blue collar Pittsburghers and taking people to ballgames.</p>
<p>He took Jim and his college roommate, Brian O’Halloran, to baseball’s All-Star game at Three Rivers Stadium in 1994. Last October, O’Halloran was named general manager of the Boston Red Sox.</p>
<p>“To this day it’s still the only All-Star game I’ve been to,” O’Halloran laughed. “It’s just something a lot of front office people don’t go to much because they’d rather have some free time or whatever. What I really respected about Mr. McVay was that he represented people like my dad, who was a union printer at the Boston Herald. Mr. McVay was super, super nice to me, but what I remember most was his influence on his son, and how Jim talked about how his dad influenced him in a wonderful way.”</p>
<p>Despite everything Bill McVay saw in sports, despite everything he arranged for others to see, he was not necessarily an advocate of spectating.</p>
<p>“He went to more sporting events than anybody but he always said that you want to participate if you can, don’t watch somebody else play, play yourself,” Jim said. “So he coached me in sports and my sister Janice played sports and he coached her in softball. It seems like he coached everybody in either baseball or softball and he’d schedule his work around it. He did it because he wanted them to be good young men and women. He thought that sports were the best avenue to teach people about life and that it keeps them out of trouble.”</p>
<p>So a lot of lessons apparently got learned. Jim is a lawyer and a high school hockey coach of some note. Maybe you’ve heard about Bethel Park’s five state championships and one national championship. Janice is a doctor of dental surgery. Five grandchildren also felt Bill’s influence.</p>
<p>This Father’s Day, one enduring lesson about compassion resonates like no other, just as Bill McVay said it would.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget being at the hospital when his dad was dying in February 1981,” Jim said. “His dad asked if the Pirates won today, and I remember when we left the hospital I asked my dad why he said they won today when they were not playing in February, and he said he thought that was the way his dad wanted to remember them. ‘You will understand one day.’</p>
<p>“I do now.”</p>
