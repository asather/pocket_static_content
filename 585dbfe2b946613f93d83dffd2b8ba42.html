<h1>Political upstarts compete in Republican primary for Turzai seat, long held by Harrisburg heavyweight</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The three-way Republican primary race for the chance to fill House Speaker Mike Turzai seat features a financial services executive, a 29-year-old Republican staffer and a three-term member of the North Allegheny School Board.</p>
<p>That means the Republican winner in Tuesday’s primary in Pennsylvania’s 28th House District — held by Mr. Turzai since 2001 as he climbed through the ranks in Harrisburg — will be a political upstart. The reliably Republican district encompasses roughly 67,000 people living in&nbsp;the North Hills suburbs, including Bradford Woods, Franklin Park, McCandless, Marshall and Pine.</p>
<p>Mr. Turzai has been a prominent face across the state, especially in recent years during the legislature’s tense budget negotiations with Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat. Last week, Mr. Turzai came under fire after a Republican member failed to publicly disclose a positive test for COVID-19. (Mr. Turzai claimed he did not know about the positive test but said the member should have disclosed it.)</p>
<p>Mr. Turzai has thrown his weight into the race.</p>
<p>Within a day of announcing his retirement in January, Mr. Turzai endorsed Robert Mercuri, a vice president and financial risk manager&nbsp;for the PNC Financial Services Group and a West Point graduate who deployed to Iraq after 9/11.&nbsp;Mr. Turzai praised Mr. Mercuri’s “combination of decorated military service and his principled outlook.”</p>
<p>“He recognized that my credentials and my conservative values will enable me to follow in his footsteps,” said Mr. Mercuri, 38, of Pine, in an interview.&nbsp;“He recognized that getting young people in office who have families who are raising kids in their district and who have the skills and credentials needed to succeed in the legislative body is really, really important.”</p>
<p>Mr. Mercuri will run against one of Mr. Turzai’s aides, Michael Heckmann, a legislative staff member for the Pennsylvania House Republican Caucus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Heckmann, a lifelong McCandless resident, touted his experience diving into a broad range of policy matters working alongside the speaker and 110 members of the General Assembly’s Republican delegation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He acknowledged that replacing Mr. Turzai with a freshman lawmaker inherently will come with less influence for the 28th District in Harrisburg, but he believes he brings the most state policy chops to ease the transition. After earning a bachelor’s degree from the NYU Stern School of Business and a degree from Vanderbilt Law School, he has spent the last two years in Harrisburg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Working in the capitol, having already sat in the caucus room, knowing the legislators and the staff and the interest groups and the issues on a pretty deep level — I’ll be able to hit the ground running,” Mr. Heckmann said.</p>
<p>“I intentionally try to be very substantive and policy-oriented in my campaign, and that’s had a very good response from voters,” he said, sharing the fine details of his proposal to ease property taxes and slightly increase sales taxes and income taxes so the state avoids revenue losses.</p>
<p>Libby Blackburn, currently serving her third term on the North Allegheny School Board, said the state’s fiscal issues drove her to run for the seat.&nbsp;Ms. Blackburn,&nbsp;of McCandless, retired after 27 years working for U.S. Airways and American Airlines, including seven years commuting to Philadelphia after U.S. Airways pulled out from Pittsburgh International Airport.</p>
<p>That pullout in the mid-2000s brought home the issue of bringing back corporate headquarters and jobs to the Pittsburgh region, she said. She supports lowering the state’s corporate tax rate and further reforming pension system, moving retirement funds to a 401(k)-style plans for future workers. She would also, if elected, refuse a state pension and support term limits.</p>
<p>Ms. Blackburn said her experience managing the school district’s $175 million annual budget has prepared her for the tough decisions that would lie ahead as a state legislator amid the economic crisis caused by the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to go through that [state] budget, line item by line item, and we’re going to have to take out some things,” she said.&nbsp;“We aren’t going to have the tax revenues we were expecting.”</p>
<p>The winner of the Republican primary will face Democrat Emily Skopov in November.</p>
