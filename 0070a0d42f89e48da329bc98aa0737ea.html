<h1> Report: Tape links Trump to ouster of Ukraine diplomat </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NEW YORK — President Donald Trump can be heard in a taped 2018 conversation saying he wants to get rid of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, whose removal a year later emerged as an issue in Mr. Trump’s impeachment. The president was talking with a small group that included Lev Parnas, an associate of his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to a report Friday about the audio recording.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump demanded the removal of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch at an April 2018 dinner at his hotel in Washington, D.C., according to ABC News, which reported on the recording. The recording appears to contradict the president’s statements that he did not know Mr. Parnas, a key figure in the investigation.</p>
<p>ABC said a speaker, who seems to be Mr. Trump, says on the recording, “Get rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don’t care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. OK? Do it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Parnas and associate Igor Fruman worked with Mr. Giuliani on a push to get Ukraine to announce it would investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. On the recording, the two tell Mr. Trump that the U.S. ambassador has been insulting him, which leads directly to the apparent remarks by the president.</p>
<p>The White House denied any suggestion of presidential wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Ms. Yovanovitch, who was viewed as an obstacle to probes into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, was not recalled from her position until the following April. She said the decision was based on “unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives” that she was disloyal to Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>Mr. Parnas appears to say on the recording: “The biggest problem there, I think where we need to start is we gotta get rid of the ambassador. She’s still left over from the Clinton administration.”</p>
<p>He later can be heard telling Mr. Trump, “She’s basically walking around telling everybody, ‘Wait, he’s gonna get impeached, just wait.’”</p>
<p>House investigators have been working to document an almost yearlong effort on the part of Mr. Parnas and Mr. Giuliani to have Ms. Yovanovitch removed from her post. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were recently indicted by the Southern District of New York on charges including conspiracy to commit campaign finance fraud. Both have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Democrats seized on the recording as further evidence of Mr. Trump’s involvement.</p>
<p>“If this is additional evidence of his involvement in that effort to smear her, it would certainly corroborate much of what we’ve heard, but I’m not in a position yet to analyze that, not having looked at it,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., one of the House impeachment managers.</p>
<p>Mr. Parnas has done a series of interviews in recent days in which he has asserted that Mr. Trump was aware of the plan to remove Ms. Yovanovitch. Mr. Trump has distanced himself from Mr. Parnas.</p>
<p>“I don’t know Parnas other than I guess I had pictures taken, which I do with thousands of people,” Mr. Trump said last week. “But I just met him. I don’t know him at all. Don’t know what he’s about, don’t know where he comes from, know nothing about him. I can only tell you this thing is a big hoax.”</p>
<p>A request to Mr. Parnas and his lawyer for comment was not immediately answered.</p>
