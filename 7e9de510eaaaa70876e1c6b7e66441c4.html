<h1>Homewood man sentenced for 2017 shooting, robbery of 18-year-old woman at East Busway stop</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pittsburgh man was sentenced Wednesday to 30 to 60 years in prison for shooting an 18-year-old woman in the back and then robbing her as she&nbsp;exited a Port Authority bus along the East Busway in Homewood three years ago.</p>
<p>Jawan Johnson, 23, of Homewood, was convicted by a jury in February of attempted homicide, aggravated assault and robbery. He was sentenced by Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Randal B. Todd.</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint in the case, Johnson in July 2017 followed the Braddock woman as she stepped off a bus at the North Homewood Avenue stop heading inbound on the East Busway.</p>
<p>After following her down steps from the bus station, Johnson yelled,&nbsp;“Give me what you got,” pulled out a firearm and shot the victim in the back, the complaint said. The victim threw her blue clutch bag containing $400, and Johnson took it and ran away.</p>
<p>The woman ran for help before collapsing near the 7 Senses restaurant in the 500 block of North Homewood. Medics arrived at the scene and took her to the hospital in critical condition, police said.</p>
<p>Detectives obtained video showing Johnson getting on and off a bus and following the victim. At the Zone 5 police station, detectives said, Johnson identified himself in the video but denied that he shot anyone, the complaint said.&nbsp;However, the victim and a second witness both identified Johnson after police showed them a photo array.</p>
<p>Police also noted that Johnson was ineligible to possess a firearm after he pleaded guilty to a robbery in 2012.</p>
