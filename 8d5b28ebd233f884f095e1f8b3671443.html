<h1>Unemployment rate could surpass 20% and job market may worsen, White House advisers say</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON - Two of President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers projected Sunday that unemployment will climb as the coronavirus pandemic continues its sweep across the United States, with one official predicting that the unemployment rate will jump to 20% by next month.</p>
<p>The statements from White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin came three days after the Labor Department reported its highest unemployment figures since the Great Depression, and as the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 79,000.</p>
<p>At a time when governors are grappling with how and when to safely reopen their states, the comments by Hassett and Mnuchin underscore that the country is far from snapping back to normal and that further economic pain is probably still to come.</p>

<p>In an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Hassett said the unemployment rate probably will rise to “north of 20%” in the next month, up from 14.7% reported Thursday.</p>
<p>“To get unemployment rates like the ones that we’re about to see . . . which I think will climb up towards 20% by next month, you have to really go back to the Great Depression to see that,” Hassett told host Margaret Brennan.</p>
<p>He added that “nobody knows” when those who have lost their jobs will be able to go back to work, clarifying a statement he made upon the release of Friday’s jobs report that “almost everybody” who has accounted for the recent rise in unemployment “said they expect to go back to work in six months.”</p>
<p>Hassett’s acknowledgment of the country’s dire economic straits was echoed by Mnuchin, who said on “Fox News Sunday” that he expects the second quarter of this year to be worse than the first.</p>
<p>“The reported numbers are probably going to get worse before they get better,” Mnuchin told host Chris Wallace, later adding: “I think you’re going to have a very, very bad second quarter.”</p>
<p>When asked by Wallace whether the country’s unemployment number was “close to 25% at this point, which is Great Depression neighborhood,” Mnuchin said, “Chris, we could be.”</p>
<p>According to report released Friday, the U.S. economy shed 20.5 million jobs in April, wiping out a decade of employment gains in a single month as businesses across the country shut down or curtailed operations in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The job market’s historic plunge was far deeper than what the nation experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. No industry has been spared, even white-collar jobs in government and business services thought to be relatively safe.</p>
<p>Still, Mnuchin on Sunday expressed confidence in the fundamentals of the economy. He argued that the job market should begin to right itself by September as he echoed Trump’s calls for a phased reopening of the economy. This economic crisis “is no fault of American business, it is no fault of American workers, it is the fault of a virus,” Mnuchin said.</p>
