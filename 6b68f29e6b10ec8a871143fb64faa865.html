<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 09.09.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, we’re going to start our chat in about 5 or so minutes. Have to go early today because of Steelers practice. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, here we go. Let’s get started.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Gerry! Regarding your previous tweet. Any Idea on who might get extended next? Doubt it wouldn’t be Feiler ( Dotson, Grey, Steve ). Alex seem unlikely as well. Sutton &amp; Hilton would be the cheapest but disrespectful to do one without the other no? That leaves Juju. But seems like he could make more if he has a good season. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I really don’t, but it won’t be Watt because he will get a BIG contract. That will wait till next year. And I’m not sure that they will extend another player before Monday. All I know is that it’s still a possibility. Sutton and Hilton are down-the-road guys. Feiler would make the most sense.</p>
<p><strong>Beth G</strong>: Gerry, do you think Josh Dobbs will be given a fair opportunity to unseat Mason Rudolph? Correct me if I am wrong, but this may be one of the first seasons he has been able to work with a dedicated QB coach. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. Mason Rudolph is the No. 2 QB. Only way Dobbs plays is if something happens to the two QBs in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Gerry, do you get any indication either by watching practices or thru interviews that this squad is different than past ones? Is it better or worse; and why? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: One thing I learned in my years doing this is you can never learn anything about the makeup of a team or how good they will be by watching practice or talking to the players. The proof comes from a game, and we haven’t had any.</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Gerry - Did you like the late roster moves made? Do the Steelers stand pat at ILB or do you think something still will happen there? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes I did. I think they would have been OK with Duck as the third QB because, after all, he’s had more playing time than Dobbs. But I’m not surprised they brought Dobbs back. And bringing back Davis, a former starter, was a really good move. If he’s your backup at safety, you’re doing OK. On paper, Colquitt looks like an upgrade for sure, but he is 38. And, no, I don’t think you will see any kind of move at ILB.</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville</strong>: Morning, Gerry. I know it’s probably not going to happen but do you know if the Steelers have had any negotiations at all with the other guys going into their <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Here’s the rest of that question....last years? Even just to exchange numbers to get an idea? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: And here’s my response....I don’t know that to be the case, but I also don’t think they are exchanging numbers just to get a better feel for next year. If they are talking, seriously talking, they are doing so with the idea of getting a deal done.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Can Waitman both punt and kick or is he strictly a punter? I’m just wondering why he is on the practice squad, especially after signing Colquitt. Thank you <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, that could always change, and I expect that will sometime soon, once the Steelers know that Colquitt can still handle the job. Remember, there has been no game to see if he can still do it. Just one practice.</p>

<p><strong>Jay</strong>: Have the Steelers solidified enough on defense to handle Lamar Jackson and the Ravens this year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Their defense is as equipped as any to handle Lamar Jackson. They have 5 guys who run a sub-4.4, including their inside linebacker. I’m not saying they will, I’m just saying they are better equipped than anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: What do you think of Alualu at NT? I know it’s not a significant amount of plays but we need to be able to stop the run on 3rd and short, <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He is fine as a 3-4 NT against the run. Very strong and plays with leverage</p>
<p><strong>Big Ed</strong>: GM Gerry. I personally have major concerns about our offensive line, &amp; this was before DeCastro was ruled out, lwhat say you? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Big Ed, don’t get too concerned. It’s early. But I still think they are better with Feiler at right tackle. That is an important spot when you have a QB like BR</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Garry do you expect Ben to back this year to his usual Pro-Bowl caliber production, or will his injury cause a significant drop. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That’s what we’re going to find out. But, I don’t believe there will be a significant drop, even a drop of any kind. Give him a game or two to get his feel back and calm his nerves and he will be fine. I’ll be surprised if he isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Jay Daven</strong>: Gerry, are there going to be more televised games this year because of the lack of fans in NFL stadiums? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Is it possible to televise even more???</p>
<p><strong>mo nongahela</strong>: In your years of covering them, which Steelers team surprised you most in a positive way? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That’s hard to say on short notice. Probably the 2005 team that was 7-5 and went on to win the Super Bowl. The 2002 team that started 1-3 and shoulda beat Tennessee in an AFC divisional playoff game. 1993 when they lost first two games by a combined 51-13 and got in as a wild card. And, of course, 1989, when they lost first two by a combined 92-10 and made it to divisional playoff game in Denver...and shoulda won that were it not for a dropped pass by Mark Stock.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Not a huge concern I guess, but one thing I haven’t seen discussed much is lack of CB depth. Outside of moving Sutton out there, basically no experience. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: On the contrary, their CB depth is pretty good with Sutton, Hilton and an improving Justin Layne. And we’ll see how good undrafted rookie James Pierre turns out to be.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Greetings Jerry. Do you think the coaches have a firm plan to replace Baaron or will that evolve as the season progresses and perhaps be influenced by opponent? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yeah, his name is Vince Williams, a long-time starter. OK, VW will likely have some problems is pass situations, and they know that. But they will try Ulysees Gilbert and Marcus Allen there in pass situations in their sub packages. It might not be ideal, but that’s what they will discover.</p>

<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Hi Gerry - I for one am concerned about the change in punters - in terms of Boz’s psyche. Talk me off the ledge Gerry, <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: If you are worried about that, I suggest you go watch tennis.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Agree to disagree...I wouldn’t call that good depth, just a bunch of unproven guys who have never played that position in real games. But you can’t have proven backups at every position. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That is correct. That’s like people who complain about a lack of depth on an offensive line. There aren’t many, if any, teams in the league who have good depth on an offensive line, though I think the Steelers have as good as any.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Gerry - Who opens up as kick return at Giants? If DJ is punt returner, who is option #2 for that role? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I believe you will see Ray-Ray McCloud be the kick returner.</p>
<p><strong>Timmy Snowy Colorado Springs</strong>: Are the Colquitts the first father son combo for the Steelers? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes, first ones in their history</p>
<p><strong>Lucky</strong>: Do you think Edmunds gets a few turnovers this year? Will he take the next next step toward being a playmaker? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Let’s put it this way -- he can’t get any less. It’s year 3 for him, time to take the step.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph LA</strong>: Were you at all surprised by the number of roster changes? With the lack of preseason games the pundits were predicting few surprises. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, wasn’t surprised at all. I was surprised that after six seasons and only 41 career tackles they chose now to cut Dan McCullers. And bringing back guys who know the Steelers system, especially with no game evaluation period, was no surprise at all. Almost expected.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Hi Gerry - Who gets more snaps in Giants game - Ola or Highsmith? If Highsmith is heir apparent, why not start on that path in game 1? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They will play the guy who they feel is most ready now. But, going forward, they will use Highsmith more and more, especially if he shows he can handle the job.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Hi Gerry - Rank order which Steeler will be next for contract restructure? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They could restructure just about anyone who has a big deal, so take your pick.</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong>: Why not take chance on Bronco’s LB that was cut. Seems like he would be insurance if one of our starters went down. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: At this point, there are not bringing in outsiders who have never played for the Steelers</p>
<p><strong>one-eyed fred</strong>: We cut Dobbs, then he was cut by Jacksonviille. Obviously, he lacks skills needed in the NFL. Is he another Paxton Lynch? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They didn’t cut Dobbs, they traded him, because they knew Rudolph was their No. 2 QB. You can’t compare him to Lynch, who was a former No. 1 draft pick. Dobbs was a fourth-round pick. His bar wasn’t set nearly so high.</p>
<p><strong>Reston Stiller Fan</strong>: Any idea how much guaranteed money is in Cam’s contract? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t, but I do know that by Friday he will receive $20 million in signing and roster bonuses.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Gerry - Interested in your personal view on Tomlin’s approach to distributing snaps with RB? His old school approach seems to run counter to the trend in the league? Bell cows seem to have short lived careers - even in the context of RB tenures in the league? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, it has always worked in the past, so tough to argue, especially if you have the type of back who can play all three downs -- and Conner can do that. But that doesn’t mean he won’t work those other guys in. They didn’t draft Anthony McFarland, in the words of Tom Donahoe, to lead the band at halftime. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, kids, gotta run. Outta time. See you next week.</p>
