<h1>How Pitt will handle its first road game during the COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After hosting Austin Peay in the non-conference and drawing three consecutive ACC home games, Pitt will play away from Heinz Field for the first time this Saturday. And the Panthers ought to get used to it.</p>
<p>Five of Pitt’s final seven games are on the road. The Panthers travel to Boston College, followed by Miami. A home game against Notre Dame on Oct. 24 breaks things up a bit before an off week and trips to Florida State and Georgia Tech. Pitt finishes its regular season at home against Virginia Tech and at Clemson on Nov. 21 and 28, respectively.</p>
<p>When asked about the back-loaded road slate, Pitt head coach Pat Narduzzi said “it is what it is.” He noted that Boston College won’t have fans in attendance on Saturday at Alumni Stadium, so it’s not as if crowd noise will be an issue at the 4 p.m. kick.</p>
<p>But this weekend will present a new challenge for the Panthers: traveling for the first time during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“This is something no one has done before on our team,” Pitt wide receiver DJ Turner said Tuesday. “I feel like we’ve got to take it as it goes and do whatever we’re told just to protect ourselves and the whole team. And we’ve got to try to stay as focused as we can on playing with everything that’s going on.”</p>
<p>“We have to wear our masks for two hours on a flight,”&nbsp;Narduzzi added Monday. “There’s talk of us not even eating on the flight. You want to leave that thing up as we’re around different people. We’ve stayed in our bubble. I know our kids are out on campus, but I don’t know if the stewardesses are being tested. I don’t know how all of that works. ... It’s the same thing at a hotel, a different hotel. Who lives in that hotel?”</p>
<p>Narduzzi said his program will approach the road trip with a “pretend like everybody’s got COVID and protect yourself” mentality. Which is fair, considering Boston moved into the highest-risk category on Massachusetts’ coronavirus risk map for the first time last week.</p>
<p>Even still, Pitt players expressed confidence in the program’s COVID-19 protocols and their ability to stay safe. Offensive lineman Bryce Hargrove believes there is “no concern” from him or his teammates over the issue of travel, while linebacker SirVocea Dennis said: “I don’t think any of us are worried.”</p>
<p>One thing the Panthers can take comfort in is the consistency of their routine and results.</p>
<p>In terms of testing, this week will be pretty normal for Pitt. The Panthers tested Sunday and will test on Wednesday and Friday, as has been the case for the last month.</p>
<p>Plus, the Panthers are using Mako Medical, the ACC’s hand-picked testing company based in North Carolina, for all three weekly tests. During training camp and at least in the buildup to Week 1, Pitt employed BioReference Laboratories out of New Jersey for the program’s Sunday and Wednesday testing. Narduzzi said the change has “eliminated a lot of stresses.”</p>
<p>“You’re not every day on edge,” Narduzzi added. “Back in the camp it was like seven days a week you were like — you couldn’t ever catch a breath.”</p>
<p>So that uncertainty has subsided. But being on the road this weekend does bring a different testing variable into play.</p>
<p>Pitt’s Friday testing will be conducted in the morning at the team’s South Side facility, which isn’t anything new for Narduzzi or his coaches. Those results will get back to Narduzzi late Friday night or early Saturday morning.</p>
<p>That hasn’t been a problem the last four weeks. Pitt hasn’t had any COVID-related absences the last two games. And when it had seven absences against Austin Peay and three against Syracuse, it was relatively simple to direct those players into isolation while in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>However, if a team member’s Sunday and Wednesday test results come back negative, they’ll travel with the team to Boston on Friday afternoon. And if a player or coach’s Friday morning test comes back positive, they will be isolated from the rest of the team by Pitt’s medical officials and will travel back to Pittsburgh from Boston separately.</p>
<p>Narduzzi is hoping that isn’t necessary on Saturday. Ideally, the Panthers’ Friday tests come back all clear for the third week in a row and Pitt’s first road trip goes off without a hitch.</p>
<p>In order for that to happen, though, Pitt’s coach — who said last week that “just because we’re good right now doesn’t mean we’ll be good in the future” — knows his players have to remain diligent, stay cognizant of their surroundings and keep their masks on at all times.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure we come out nice and clean,” Narduzzi said, “because it’s all about the safety of our football team.”</p>
