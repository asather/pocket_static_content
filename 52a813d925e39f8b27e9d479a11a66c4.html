<h1>The familiar red and green CoGo's logo won't be around for much longer</h1>

<p>More than two years after picking up the CoGo’s stores, Canonsburg-based Coen Markets Inc. is putting all its locations under a new name.</p>
<p>All 38 CoGo’s locations will switch from the red and green logo to the Coen’s design done in blue, green and orange in the next three or so months, according to CEO Charles McIlvaine. The name change also comes with new product offerings, including some of Coen’s kitchen items like from-scratch pizza and hand-breaded, made-on-site chicken.</p>
<p>Coen Markets, which owns stores in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2018/12/26/CoGo-Coen-Markets-convenience-stores-Pittsburgh/stories/201812260099" target="_blank">picked up the CoGo’s locations in December 2018</a>. Changing the name and product offerings to create a unified image was always part of the plan, Mr. McIlvaine said.</p>
<p>“We’re interested in having one image, one voice out there for our guests, our customers,” he said. “It’s important for them to know us.”</p>
<p>Coen Markets traces its roots to 1923, when its parent company, Coen Oil, opened a single store selling gasoline in Washington, Pa. Prior to the acquisition, Coen Markets operated 28 stores under its Ruff Creek Market brand in Washington, Westmoreland and Green counties.</p>
<p>The transition to the Coen’s name will occur at all 60 locations, including CoGo’s stores, Ruff Creek Market brand and Kwick King locations in Ohio. Already, the company has made the switch at some CoGo’s locations, including one in South Park.</p>
<p>CoGo’s originated as a retail arm of Colteryahn Dairy in Carrick, which operated the last dairy facility in Pittsburgh until it was sold to Turner’s Dairy in 2017.</p>
<p>The red and green CoGo’s logo has become familiar to motorists passing through Pittsburgh and the surrounding suburbs, and Mr. McIlvaine acknowledged it was important to be clear about the name change to keep customer recognition and loyalty of both brands.</p>
<p>“I think any brand transition where you go from X to Y ... You’ve got to make sure there’s communication and that you’re actually clearly articulating the value proposition,” he said. “We’re obviously making a deliberate decision. I think it's better to be named one thing than to be named two things.”</p>
<p>Mr. McIlvaine did not disclose how much the changes would cost but said the company is putting a meaningful amount of money and resources toward the effort. “This isn’t putting minor details up,” he said.</p>
<p>Coen Markets has more than 700 employees, and about 600 are based in Pennsylvania.</p>
