<h1>In video to 'Jeopardy!' fans, Alex Trebek marks 1-year anniversary of cancer diagnosis</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Alex Trebek is reflecting on a long and difficult year of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2019/03/06/alex-trebek-cancer-announcement-video-jeopardy/stories/201903060159" target="_blank">fighting pancreatic cancer</a> on the anniversary of his diagnosis.</p>
<p>In a video posted to the “Jeopardy!” Twitter feed, the longtime host said he had beaten the low odds of surviving longer than one year for a patient diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>“If you’ve got a minute I’d like to bring you up to date on my health situation,” he said.&nbsp;“The one-year survival rate for Stage 4 pancreatic cancer patients is 18%. I’m very happy to report I have just reached that marker.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trebek, who regularly uses the platform to update viewers on his battle,&nbsp;recapped his <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2020/01/02/Alex-Trebek-depression-pancreatic-cancer-jeopardy-show-tv/stories/202001020143" target="_blank">struggles with mental health</a> and the adverse effects of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>“I joke with friends that if the cancer won’t kill me, the chemo treatments will,” he said. “There were moments of great pain, days when certain bodily functions no longer functioned and sudden massive attacks of great depression that made me wonder if it really was worth fighting on.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trebek, 79, said he owed it to himself, his wife, Jean, his faith, and fellow cancer patients to continue to fight and is motivated to reach another year of survival. He said his oncologist told him there is a 7% chance of surviving two years.</p>
<p>On March 6, 2019, Mr. Trebek told the world of his diagnosis and has since been open about his journey and personal battles.</p>
<p>In his latest update, Mr. Trebek promised to take it one day at a time with a positive attitude and continue to keep “Jeopardy!” fans posted on his progress.</p>
