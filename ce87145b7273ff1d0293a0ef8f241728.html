<h1>Lamb tells constituents Congress has tackled issues, aside from impeachment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As President Donald Trump’s lawyers began their defense of the president in his impeachment trial 250 miles away in Washington, U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb took the stage at Mt. Lebanon High School for his first town hall of the new year and assured his constituents there are other important things happening in the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb, the 17th District Democrat who voted to impeach Mr. Trump but hasn’t been overtly outspoken during the proceedings, told his constituents that they may have missed several key Congressional accomplishments while both parties —&nbsp;and the media —&nbsp;bickered about impeachment.</p>
<p>“At the end of the year, obviously the subject of impeachment got a lot of attention in the media and probably a lot of folks around here are concerned about it and have questions about it and that’s fine,” Mr. Lamb said at the opening of the town hall. “I wanted to let you know that the same week, Congress did ... other incredibly important things all at the same time.”</p>
<p>Congress, Mr. Lamb said, passed a budget that included $1.5 billion in new opioid crisis assistance grants to the states and $41 billion to the National Institute of Health, and passed legislation giving Medicare the power to bargain over the price of prescription drugs.</p>
<p>House Bill 3, which Mr. Lamb hopes will be taken up by the Senate this year, will save the government money, too, he said, which can be used to add vision, dental and hearing benefits to Medicare.</p>
<p>“You’re going to get dentures, hearing aids and glasses for free, and we don’t have to pay any more in taxes to give it to you,” Mr. Lamb said. “So, pretty good bill.”</p>
<p>When the time came for audience questions, Mr. Lamb was peppered with inquiries about his ideological stances and the movement of specific bills in D.C, including several on gun control and mass shootings.</p>
<p>Asked by an eighth-grader at Keystone Oaks Middle School about stopping school shootings, Mr. Lamb said over the last few years, Congress has focused on things like school security —&nbsp;including paying for school resource officers —&nbsp;and said the federal government can continue to make resources and money available for state and local governments to administer.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb also said he’s a “big believer” in the provision of mental health services.</p>
<p>Later, on the topic of guns, Mr. Lamb said he’s a realist who may not go as far as others in his party —&nbsp;because he believes the vast majority of gun owners use guns safely and legally —&nbsp;but that reasonable steps should be taken such as instituting universal background checks, red flag laws and expansions on the scope of disqualifying offenses.</p>
<p>“I think we’re heading down the right track. Unfortunately, the Senate occasionally entertains the idea of taking up these bills, but they haven’t done it yet,” Mr. Lamb said. “So to bring me back to where I started, we have an election this year, and anyone seeking office is going to have to let people know where they stand on these important issues.”</p>
<p>Some questioners echoed criticisms from national Republican groups, who have accused Mr. Lamb of voting in lockstep with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi —&nbsp;a favorite target of conservatives.</p>
<p>“If someone told you that, sir, I’m sorry because they didn’t inform you,” Mr. Lamb said to one man who made that argument, noting that he didn’t vote for Ms. Pelosi for his party’s speakership and that 80% of the votes he’s cast have been on bipartisan legislation.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb, who endorsed Joe Biden for president earlier this month and has since campaigned for him in Iowa and New Hampshire, also was asked if he found it acceptable that the former vice president’s son, Hunter, was paid to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was leading anti-corruption efforts there —&nbsp;a rallying point for Republicans who defend Mr. Trump against impeachment charges.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb said no one has presented any evidence to suggest Hunter Biden broke the law, but acknowledged that it’s fair to ask, “is the appearance of this a good thing?”</p>
<p>“Is it a good thing for the vice president’s son to be making money on the board in a country where he’s exerting his influence?” Mr. Lamb asked. “My answer is no. I think that was a mistake.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb added that moving forward, he’ll be someone who “advocates for tightening those rules so that we don’t have that in future administrations.”</p>
