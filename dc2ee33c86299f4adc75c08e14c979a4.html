<h1>Federal charges filed against suspect in Downtown riot</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the man accused of attacking a Pittsburgh police car last Saturday was interviewed by the FBI on Monday, he admitted to what he did, they said, telling the investigator that he prepared to participate in the march the day before by buying several cans of spray paint, and loading those and several rocks in his backpack.</p>
<p>“[Brian] Bartels’ explanation as to his motive for engaging in the destruction of the police vehicle was, in part, that he considers himself to be far ‘left,’ and that he had become fed up with incidents involving police mistreatment of citizens,” FBI Agent Matthew Dunleavy wrote in the affidavit.</p>
<p>Mr. Bartels explained it as a “[expletive] it” moment when he decided to destroy the police car.</p>
<p>Mr. Bartels is now charged in federal district court with obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder.</p>
<p>It is a felony punishable by up to a $250,000 fine and five years in prison.</p>
<p>The criminal complaint was filed Friday initially under seal.</p>
<p>“Bartels’s actions turned an otherwise peaceful protest into a violent riot that resulted in an evening of destruction throughout Downtown Pittsburgh,” said Scott Brady, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. “Anyone who would do the same should know this — If you try to hijack a peaceful protest for your own violent agenda, we will use every tool at our disposal to find you and prosecute you.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bartels, 20, of Shaler had previously been charged by Pittsburgh police with one felony count each of criminal mischief, institutional vandalism and riot, along with misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person.</p>
<p>He was identified by an anonymous tip from a co-worker at Amazon after Mr. Bartels’ picture from the incident was circulated widely on social media</p>
<p>He turned himself in Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Bartels posted a $10,000 bond through a bail bond agency and was released from the Allegheny County Jail the next day.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney’s office would not say if Mr. Bartels is in their custody.</p>
<p>The federal court filing includes as exhibits video from the incident in which Mr. Bartels can be seen throwing rocks at the police SUV, flashing obscene gestures of the protesters trying to stop him, reaching into his backpack and putting the can of red spray paint back in it.</p>
<p>Those trying to stop him shouted, “You’re not helping us.”</p>
<p>The videos obtained by investigators show him walking out of the crowd toward the car, wearing a black bandanna covering half his face, black pants and a black hooded sweatshirt.</p>
<p>He can be seen accessing his backpack, prosecutors said, pulling out a can of red spray paint and painting on the vehicle.</p>
<p>He also kicked the car, threw an object breaking a window and later stomped on the windshield.</p>
<p>As he continued the U.S. Attorney said in a news release, several people from the crowd joined him and heavily damaged the car.</p>
<p>Mounted police had arrived, the release continued, but when it appeared they were in danger from the crowd, those officers retreated.</p>
<p>Another vehicle that had been left was then also damaged and set on fire.</p>
<p>When Mr. Bartels was interviewed by Agent Dunleavy, Mr. Bartels said that he hoped he would be able to change things through voting, the complaint said, but nothing changed.</p>
<p>“He said that, as he was spray painting and hitting the police car, most of the crowd seemed to be encouraging him to keep going and therefore, he did so.”</p>
