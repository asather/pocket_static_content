<h1>Opinions range widely in community as PPS prepares reopening plan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jeff Vishner wrote the testimony he presented to the Pittsburgh Public Schools board Monday night at a place that has become too familiar to him over the past few months: Allegheny General Hospital.</p>
<p>Since his wife contracted COVID-19 in March, the Westinghouse 6-12 teacher said, she had been to Allegheny General Hospital seven times and needed several more trips to the emergency room. The previously healthy 34-year-old woman — who at one point had to be quarantined away from her family for 53 days —&nbsp;remains mostly bedridden more than 120 days after her diagnosis, Mr. Vishner said.</p>
<p>For all of those reasons, Mr. Vishner implored the district to move instruction fully online for the 2020-21 academic year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I truly, truly hope that you will decide that opening Pittsburgh Public Schools virtually this fall is of paramount importance and essential to the health and safety of our whole community,” he said. “If not, I fear that many of us will be faced with the same choice I will be faced with — deciding between my family’s livelihood and a loved one’s life.”</p>
<p>Mr. Vishner was not the only person who called upon the district to move to an online-only format at Monday night’s public hearing before the school board. Some who provided testimony to the school board thought that students should have the option to return to in-person instruction full time. Meanwhile, others raised questions about the district’s reopening plan as the school board prepares to vote on it Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district said last week that under its plan, students would have&nbsp;a choice of blended instruction — both in-person and online — as well as an online-only option for the 2020-21 school year.</p>
<p>Students who choose to participate in the blended model would be split into two groups and attend classes in person two days per week. Classes would be online the other three days.</p>
<p>Michele Nagle, a parent of three students in the district, said scientific evidence shows that COVID-19 infection rates for those under 15 years old does not necessitate closing schools.</p>
<p>She told the board that her children wanted to return to in-person classes full time, but the district never gave them that choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The kids want quality education,” she said.&nbsp;“In this plan, reimagining education means kids fall behind and parents lose jobs to stay home.”</p>
<p>Ms. Nagle’s daughter, Abby, a rising sophomore in the district, told the school board about how difficult of a time she and many other students had trying to learn in a virtual setting in the spring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Coming from a student, I can say this: When schooling is happening online, it doesn’t matter about learning anymore — all that matters is passing,” Abby said.&nbsp;“I honestly cannot tell you one thing I learned while taking class online, and I know a lot of other students in my classes who would say that, too. It’s just not the same.”</p>
<p>Still, some believe too many questions remain for schools to reopen even on a limited number of days per week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erin Maniford, a teacher at Pittsburgh Allegheny K-5, said she wondered what the procedure will be when a student or teacher starts to feel slightly unwell.</p>
<p>“What will happen when a student and/or teacher gets sick with COVID symptoms? Does the entire class quarantine while they wait for test results?” she asked.&nbsp;“Are we sending kids to the nurse for every cough and headache, and what is happening to those students?”</p>
<p>She continued: “Are we supposed to call off for the slightest cough, or just push through like we normally would under regular circumstances? What will happen to our class when we do call off sick and can’t find a sub?”</p>
