<h1>Pirates prospect Quinn Priester excited for next 'new challenge'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Football has always been special for Quinn Priester, the Pirates’ first-round draft pick (18th overall) in 2019. In addition to firing 97 mph fastballs as a pitcher for the Cary-Grove High (Ill.) baseball team, Priester was a converted tight end and defensive back on the Trojans’ state championship-winning football squad.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Priester loves the sport so much that he actually spent a couple Friday nights last fall going to high school football games at his alma mater, cheering on former teammates and catching up with old friends.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“You miss playing with your best friends and the guys you grew up with,” Priester said. “But I’ll happily take playing professional baseball.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Year 1 of Priester’s career was productive in myriad ways, not the least of which was getting to work out during football season and build strength instead of taxing his body by playing a contact sport.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">But for someone who comes off as significantly more mature than 19 years old, Priester was able to reflect on a lot while also trying to shorten his path to the major leagues.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“It was really nice to be able to relax and focus on baseball and really what my profession is and what my passion is,” Priester said. “It was really cool in that sense.”</span></p>
<p>For one, Priester said, he didn’t have to focus on schoolwork. Although he’s doing quite well for himself — the result of a $3.4 million signing bonus he received — Priester is an employee of the Pirates and is expected to maintain his conditioning and keep improving his physical tools.</p>
<p><span>Priester did that this offseason by driving around 90 minutes each day to work out with Allen Thomas, who’s actually the director of conditioning for the Chicago White Sox. Along with fellow prospects Alec Thomas (Allen’s son, who’s with the Diamondbacks) and Jaylen Greer from the A’s, Priester put on about a dozen pounds while also prioritizing plyometric work.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Wanting to stay more stable throughout his delivery, Priester went hard on single-leg exercises designed to increase lateral movement and power.</span></p>
<p>“It was cool waking up and going to work out rather than school,” Priester said. “It was different, but I loved every second of it. Just working out with those guys, we’re getting each other better. Then Allen’s expertise at the big league level was definitely great to be around. It was all exciting.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Priester absolutely looks different. During the Pirate City phase of spring training — essentially the first two weeks — you’d see major leaguers and minor leaguers within seconds. If he wasn’t wearing a different shirt, it would be hard to tell Priester from one of the older guys.</span></p>
<p>On the mound, he also doesn’t look like your average teenager — and didn’t pitch like one last season. In eight games (seven starts) with the Gulf Coast League Pirates, Priester pitched to a 3.03 ERA in 32 2/3 innings, with 37 strikeouts and 10 walks.</p>
<p>That earned Priester a start with Class A-Short Season West Virginia in the New York-Penn League, where Priester struggled with his control; he walked four and hit a batter in four innings, allowing three runs (two earned) on three hits while striking out four.</p>
<p>What Priester learned was that his sinker and curveball absolutely played in pro ball; they actually became strengths. But he also needs to get better with his third pitch, a changeup, which we knew from the time the Pirates drafted Priester.</p>
<p>“Being able to throw that in any count and having the confidence to throw that in any count is going to be huge going forward for my entire career,” Priester said. “The changeup needs to get better. The breaking ball worked really well when I worked down in the zone with it. Just need to keep that in mind and get that changeup better to get it more of a big league pitch.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Priester does not know where he will start. “I’m asking the same question,” he said. And that was before the COVID-19 outbreak suspended the entire baseball season.</span></p>
<p>Pirates fans should want to keep an eye on Priester once baseball returns, as it’s possible he’ll shoot through their minor league system quickly.</p>
<p>According to Baseball America, Priester is the Pirates’ sixth-best prospect. MLB Pipeline has him ranked fourth, behind Mitch Keller, Ke’Bryan Hayes and Oneil Cruz. Only Cruz is questionable to play in the majors this season. Below Priester is Liover Peguero, the shortstop acquired in the Starling Marte trade.</p>
<p>The same as last year, Priester is on the younger end of the age spectrum. But his talent level, makeup and body could pass for someone several years older, the same way he stuck out last fall while attending Cary-Grove football games.</p>
<p>“I don’t ever feel like a 19-year-old here,” said Priester, who also — similar to Gerrit Cole — trimmed his shaggy hair. “I just feel like one of the guys. I never like to think about age just because that’s an easy excuse to make. I don’t want to do that.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Priester wants to attack 2020 the same way he did 2019, when he had confidence in himself and simply embraced the challenge of seeing how well he could fare.</span></p>
<p>“That’s kind of what I’m going to take into almost every season,” Priester said. “Other players have gotten better, but so have I and so has our team. There’s always an excitement for a new challenge.”</p>
