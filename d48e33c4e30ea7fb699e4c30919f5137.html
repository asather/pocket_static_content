<h1>PIAA wrestling championships preview: WPIAL will be well-represented in Hershey</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In 2017, the PIAA Wrestling Committee switched to partially seeded brackets for the PIAA Individual Wrestling Championships. The committee adopted a format that seeds the regional champions in each weight class.</p>
<p>The regional champs are ranked with a formula that includes a combination of the winning percentage of each wrestler and prestige points earned from placement in last year’s state and region tournaments. The rest of the bracket is predetermined depending on which region champ is seeded first.</p>
<p>The change was made because the PIAA’s predetermined brackets, which are used for almost every sport, would sometimes place the top two wrestlers in the same half of the bracket.</p>
<p>The seeding format has helped, but it does not recognize the achievements of anybody else in the bracket, even if they have won previous PIAA titles.</p>
<p>An example of that can be found in this year’s Class 3A 138-pound bracket. North Hills senior Sam Hillegas was upset 4-3 in the Class 3A WPIAL/Southwest Region final by Waynesburg junior Wyatt Henson. Hillegas won PIAA titles in his first two seasons and placed third last year.</p>
<p>Despite his previous achievements, Hillegas (35-3) is in the same quarter of the bracket with top-seed Dashawn Farber (33-8), a senior from Nazareth. Farber placed second in the state last year at the same weight. He also won two Georgia state titles before transferring to Nazareth.</p>
<p>With that in mind, a pair of two-time state champions will meet in the quarterfinals, assuming both win in the first round.</p>
<p>“Sammy certainly has a tougher road after losing to Henson,” North Hills coach Jose Martinez said. “We expected to see Farber at some point in the bracket, but didn’t think it would be in the quarterfinals. The goal is to win another state title, so Sammy will have to beat Farber and Henson to reach that goal.”</p>
<p><strong>WPIAL 3A seedings<br></strong></p>
<p>The 2020 PIAA Championships begin Thursday at the Giant Center in Hershey.</p>
<p>If the seeding follows suit, the WPIAL will be well-represented in the Class 3A finals. Seven WPIAL wrestlers are seeded No. 1, including three returning champions, and two others are seeded No. 2.</p>
<p>The returning champs are Carter Dibert, Alejandro Herrera-Rondon, and Gerrit Nijenhuis.</p>
<p>• Dibert (37-2), a junior from Franklin Regional, is the top seed at 113 after winning at 106 last year.</p>
<p>• Herrera-Rondon (39-3), a Seneca Valley junior and two-time champ, is the top seed at 132. His previous titles were at 106 and 113.</p>
<p>• Nijenhuis (43-0), a senior from Canon-McMillan, received the Outstanding Wrestler Award in last year’s finals after upsetting a two-time state champ in the 170-pound finals. He is the favorite at 182.</p>
<p>“I look at the state tournament the same way I did last year,” said Nijenhuis, when asked if he has a different mindset as a returning champ. “It doesn’t matter how high you are ranked. Everybody is 0-0 when you get to Hershey. I have to approach every match with the same intensity.”</p>
<p>The other top seeds from the WPIAL in Class 3A are Dylan Chappell, Kurtis Phipps, Ty Linsenbigler and Luke Stout.</p>
<p>• Chappell (45-4), a junior from Seneca Valley, is the favorite at 120. He lost to Dibert in the 106-pound final last year.</p>
<p>• Phipps (36-1), a Norwin senior, is the top seed at 126 after winning his fourth WPIAL title. He is also a two-time PIAA runner-up, at 106 and 120.</p>
<p>“I’m excited to get back to Hershey,” Phipps said. “It was tough losing in the finals the last two years, especially last year since I was injured. I didn’t think I had a fair shot with my ankle so badly injured. I just need four more wins to reach my goal of winning a state title.”</p>
<p>•Linsenbigler (38-2), a junior from Hempfield, is seeded No. 1 at 145. He placed fourth at 138 last year.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Stout (38-0), a Mt. Lebanon senior, is the favorite at 195. He placed fourth at 160 as a sophomore and second last year at 182.</p>
<p>“It’s great to be going back to Hershey, especially since my brother is going too,” said Stout, referring to younger brother Mac, a sophomore who won a WPIAL title at 170. “I came within one win of a state title last year. I need to take it one step further this year to become a champion.”</p>
<p>The two Class 3A wrestlers seeded No. 2 are Henson (46-4) at 138 and Hempfield junior Isaiah Vance (38-1) at 285.</p>
<p><strong>WPIAL 2A seedings<br></strong></p>
<p>In Class 2A, the WPIAL has only two wrestlers seeded No. 1, including one returning champ, and two others seeded No. 2.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Frazier senior Thayne Lawrence (21-0), a four-time WPIAL champ, is the favorite at 160. Lawrence is the defending champ who also won a state title at 152 as a sophomore.</p>
<p>Also entered at 160 is Andrew Cerniglia of Notre Dame Green Pond. Cerniglia (42-1) is also a returning state champ. He won at 145 last year.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Ellwood City senior Austin Walley (41-1) is the favorite at 182. Walley placed fourth at the same weight last season. Ellwood City has never had a state champion.</p>
<p>The two Class 2A wrestlers seeded No. 2 are South Park junior Joey Fischer (41-2) at 113 and Elizabeth Forward senior Ryan Michaels (42-2) at 120. Elizabeth Forward has never had a state champ.</p>
