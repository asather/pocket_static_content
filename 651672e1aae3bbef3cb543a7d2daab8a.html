<h1>Cody Ponce's success brings up interesting situation for Pirates, but he isn't sweating it</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the second doubleheader in eight days, the Pirates turned to Cody Ponce.</p>
<p>The right-handed, 26-year-old pitcher started the nightcap of last Thursday’s twofer against the St. Louis Cardinals, pitching 5.2 innings and earning his first major-league win. Friday, against the Cincinnati Reds, he was called upon once again, this time pitching four innings and allowing three runs on two homers.</p>
<p>That was enough. The Pirates clawed out four runs, the winning one coming on a double-play ball with runners on the corners, when the Reds allowed a run to get the two outs.</p>
<p>Ponce didn’t go five innings, so he didn’t get the win this time. To him, that doesn’t matter. The Pirates won, and he pitched.</p>
<p>“It's always a blessing to be able to take the bump every day and you get the chance to,” Ponce said after the game. “It was fun again. Still had the adrenaline and the butterflies, every time."</p>
<p>Ponce’s inclusion in the last two doubleheaders is necessary for the Pirates. Burning two of their regular starting pitchers would be a drain on resources in any season, one teams almost never take on. With that, teams are allowed an extra roster spot for doubleheaders, ostensibly to add an extra starter for one of the two games on that day.</p>
<p>In essence, then, Ponce is the Pirates’ 29th man.</p>
<p>So far, Ponce has taken that role and run with it. His start against the Cardinals was a shutout effort. He made some mistakes against the Reds, acknowledging that he shook off a sign from catcher John Ryan Murphy, which resulted in a two-run homer for Reds third baseman Eugenio Suarez.</p>
<p>Beyond that, and the solo shot later in the game, Ponce was very good. He struck out four hitters, using his curveball twice, his cutter and changeup to register those strikeouts. He was in control.</p>
<p>"I just to listen to JR. I just listen to [Murphy],” Ponce said. “Whatever he puts down, I throw. And unfortunately, I did shake a 2-1 pitch, and look what happened. It's gonna happen many more times in my career. It's not something that's new. I just kept attacking right after and I kept going forward."</p>
<p>Ponce’s doubleheader call-ups, and subsequent success, creates an interesting situation for both he and the Pirates.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh has a core of young starting pitchers at their disposal. Their starting five right now consists of Joe Musgrove, Trevor Williams, Steven Brault, Chad Kuhl and JT Brubaker. Left-hander Derek Holland seems to have been bumped to the bullpen, long-reliever role. Right-hander Mitch Keller is set to return from an oblique injury soon, and will surely recover his spot in the rotation.</p>
<p>Plus, righty Jameson Taillon will be back next season to claim his own starting spot. Holland is the only player on an expiring contract, so barring a trade or some other parting of ways, it isn’t as if the logjam gets any clearer by 2021.</p>
<p>So, then, the question of what to do with Ponce could loom larger if he continues to have success. He was likely thought to be on the outside looking in entering 2020, which makes sense. He is still young, and had yet to prove anything in the majors until this season.&nbsp;His 13 innings so far in 2020 is still so small a sample size that it doesn’t portend anything, really.</p>
<p>None of this worries Ponce. Earlier this season, he made his major-league debut against the Chicago Cubs. He recorded one out in the 11th inning before allowing Cubs shortstop Javier Baez to drive home the game-winning run on a single. During the game, he wore cleats honoring his late mother, and afterward, he spoke about the thrill of debuting and pitching in a big-league stadium.</p>
<p>Basically, he can’t concern himself with the roster outlook. All he can control is how he pitches when he is given an opportunity.</p>
<p>Last week, against the Cardinals, Ponce was at his best. Friday, he followed it up with another impressive start against the Reds.</p>
<p>Asked after the game about being the Pirates’ 29th man, knowing that he will likely go back to the alternate training site in Altoona no matter how well he pitched, Ponce provided perspective.</p>
<p>“Would you be upset playing in the big leagues?" Ponce said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You can't be upset being the 29th guy. Getting to be up here with all of the guys, the brothership that everybody has and the family that this is. If it's one day every five days, whatever the double header is, and they need me for the 29th man, I'm happy to do that. You can't be upset no matter what. These guys have got many years on me as well. I've just got to get out there, keep doing what I'm doing, and if it's not this year, then hopefully next year I can earn myself a spot."</p>
