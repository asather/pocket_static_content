<h1>Ron Cook: Matt Murray and Marc-Andre Fleury find themselves in similar spots</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Matt Murray was on top of the hockey world three years ago. For the second consecutive season, he led the Penguins to the Stanley Cup with his strong play. He was just 23, clearly the team’s goaltender for years to come. He made Marc-Andre Fleury expendable.</p>
<p>Fleury was on top of the hockey world two years ago. He landed in Vegas with the expansion Golden Knights and led the team to the Cup final in its first season, quickly becoming the face of the franchise. He was just as popular in the desert as he was here.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>The Penguins seem certain to trade Murray before next season to make room for Tristan Jarry as their No. 1 goalie. The Golden Knights have benched Fleury in these playoffs for trade-acquisition Robin Lehner.</p>
<p>Who saw this coming?</p>
<p>Murray won 15 games during the 2016 Cup run and the final seven playoff games in 2017. He was at his best in the final two games against Nashville in the 2017 Cup final, pitching 6-0 and 2-0 shutouts in Games 5 and 6. He put his name on the Cup twice even though he technically was still a rookie.</p>
<p>But Murray hasn’t been the same goaltender since. Maybe it was because of the variety of injuries that he endured. Maybe it was because of his father’s death in January 2018. Maybe it was because he didn’t have Fleury alongside pushing him to bring out his best. Regardless, Murray’s postseason play dropped dramatically. He went 1-8 in his last nine starts dating back to Game 5 against Washington in the second round in 2018. He allowed at least three goals in six of the starts and was benched by Mike Sullivan for Jarry after a 4-3 loss to Montreal in Game 3 of these playoffs. The final goal he allowed — probably of his Penguins career — was on a shot from a ridiculous angle by the Canadiens’ Jeff Petry that turned out to be the deciding goal. Jarry played well in Game 4, but the Penguins still were eliminated, 2-0.</p>
<p>Fleury’s story also took a bad turn. He’s a future Hall of Famer; his 466 regular-season wins ranks fifth on the NHL’s all-time list and his 80 postseason wins puts him in a tie for sixth with Ken Dryden. But Vegas management saw enough slippage in his game that it made a three-team trade Feb. 24 to get Lehner from the Chicago Blackhawks. Lehner has gone 8-1 since and started four of the Golden Knights’ five first-round games against Chicago. He is expected to get most of the work in the rounds ahead, even though Fleury was sharp in his one start against the Blackhawks with 26 saves in a 2-1 win in Game 3.</p>
<p>“Robin has done what you want players to do when they show up with a new team,” Vegas coach Peter DeBoer told The Athletic’s Pierre LeBrun via text on Wednesday. “He has played at a level, not just in games but also through camp, where we have had to give him the net. This is not about Flower doing something. He has been great. Robin has just been at a different level.”</p>
<p>Predictably, Fleury has taken the demotion in stride. He did the same thing when Murray supplanted him with the Penguins. It’s a big reason he’s so beloved here and in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, all that matters is winning,” Fleury told NHL.com. “That’s why we are all here. Playoffs come and you have to be selfless and do what is right for the team.”</p>
<p>There’s a good chance Fleury will get his net back, even if it might not be until next season. Lehner is going to be a free agent and is expected to sign elsewhere for big money. Fleury is signed for two more seasons with Vegas with a $7 million cap hit in each year.</p>
<p>Murray’s future with the Penguins is much more tenuous. He and Jarry are both restricted free agents, and the team can’t afford to keep both. It makes sense to trade Murray and keep Jarry, who is a little younger and figures to come back more cheaply, an important consideration for a team that’s tight against the salary cap. Jarry also played better this season.</p>
<p>It was an easy call for Rutherford after the 2017 playoffs to keep Murray and allow Fleury to leave because Murray was younger, less expensive and, of course, had played such a big part in the two Cup wins. It absolutely was the right call, even though it didn’t work out well.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time for Rutherford to make another decision about his goaltenders. This one seems just as easy. Murray has to go, Jarry has to stay.</p>
