<h1>Matt Vensel's Penguins chat transcript: 01.30.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Good afternoon, Pens fans. We'll get started in a few minutes. Go ahead and submit your questions now. The more, the merrier! <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: OK, let's do this.</p>
<p><strong>The Ham</strong>: Is it pretty much a done deal that this is Justin Shultz last season with the Pens? Could he be part of a trade that brings the top 6 winger that JR wants? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Mr. Ham, yes, it's pretty unlikely that Justin Schultz is back next year given their tight cap situation and the emergence of John Marino. Plus, top prospect Calen Addison will be ready to turn pro (could start in WBS). But I don't think the Penguins should or will dangle Schultz in a trade because their top six D, assuming Brian Dumoulin is mostly the same player when he returns, is pretty good, certainly good enough to win a Cup. Subtract Schultz and you have to count on Chad Ruhwedel in the playoffs, which is a big drop-off. This is a win-now team, so I expect Schultz to remain with the team for the Cup run then probably get paid decent pucks somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: what do you think the deadline approach is? Standing pat seems wise, esp with expiring contracts (vs taking on more long-term money) <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Scott, Jim Rutherford told The Athletic earlier this week that he wants to trade for a top winger. That does not come as a surprise but it's noteworthy that he said it. Rutherford has shown a preference to acquire non-rentals with reasonable salaries. But I'm sure he would bring in a rental if the cost is right. This team has been excellent and is very much deserving of a big upgrade up front. I don't think adding another bottom-six winger would do much to move the meter. They've got decent options in WBS to fill that kind of role.</p>
<p><strong>Rory</strong>: A couple of questions: Is there any update on Jake's injury? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: There has been no update on Jake and considering the timetable, we won't be getting anything of substance there anytime soon. The initial timetable had him back in late April at the earliest.</p>
<p><strong>Clark from Virginia </strong>: Casey DeSmith signed a one way contract last year but he was sent to Wilkes Barre this year. Does he get paid the same as if he were with the parent club? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Casey gets paid the same amount or close to it, yes. But his full salary isn't counting against the cap right now. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: At least that's my understanding of his cap situation, with a little help from Capfriendly.com. That's a great resource for this kind of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong>: Hey Matt GMJR says hes happy with the defence...With Dum coming off a scary injury and Marino never playing in playo before doeshe make a move to shore up the D <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Dan, I don't think they need to add anyone unless there is some kind of setback with Dumo. They've got a good group of six right now and Riikola, who I'm not including in that, has showed me something these last few weeks. You do raise a good point with Dumoulin, though. That's a significant injury with a long layoff. No guarantee he's the same guy we saw before the injury (see Schultz last year).</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong>: Which top prospect in your opinion is drawing the most interest Addison or Poulin ? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I'm not sure who is most coveted out of those two, who are considered the team's top two prospect. Probably depends on the team, their evaluation and what their needs are. But Addison, a slick puck-moving right-shot defenseman, is higher on most prospect lists.</p>
<p><strong>Bill M.</strong>: Matt, Do you have a short list of players who could realistically be acquired with this year’s first round pick and do you think rental or term is the way to go? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Top-six types who could be available include Chris Kreider, Jean-Gabriel Pageau, Tyler Toffoli, Tomas Tatar and Andres Anthanasiou. With the Blackhawks in the playoff hunt still, Brandon Saad probably stays there. Kreider intrigues me most. He's got size, speed and is capable of being a solid two-way guy. A lot of teams will probably agree, so the Pens will probably find themselves in a bidding war if that's the guy they really want.</p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: Just an observation from recent years. Pens seem to come out flat after All Star game with extended days off. How do you think they will perform on Friday? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Tom, I don't have a good answer for you. They haven't had many letdowns in general this season and they fared well out of the Christmas break. So that bodes well. Regardless, it's just one game.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: How long does Alex Galchenyuk have on this team? Do you see a breakout coming or him packing his bags? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I do not see a breakout coming and I think he's a goner. The Pens have to find a taker for Galchenyuk and the rest of his $4.9 million salary for this season, though, which might prove difficult. I have a hard time seeing the Pens dumping his salary AND getting a pick back. But Jim Rutherford has blown my mind before.</p>
<p><strong>burt reynolds</strong>: Realistically, where would Jason Zucker fit in as a Penguin? He seems like a middle 6 guy but isn't going to replace the offense of Guentzel and has a higher cap hit. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Burt, you're right. I've neglected Jason Zucker, another guy who could be available if Bill Guerin wants to shake up the Wild. Rutherford obviously likes him, given he already had a deal in place for him last summer that Phil Kessel nixed. He would play with either Crosby or Malkin and would fit their style.</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: Was it disclosed what Dumo has and a timetable for return besides this seasons standard, "longer term injury"? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Here's the latest on Dumoulin (from before the break): <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/01/17/Brian-Dumoulin-injury-Mike-Sullivan-Kris-Letang-Matt-Murray/stories/202001170162" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/01/17/Brian-Dumoulin...</a> <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Not much of an update. And when he got hurt the last day of November, we were told he would be out at least two months. Well, here we are, and it's unclear if he's been on the ice. We will follow up with Sullivan on him and the other injured guys later today.</p>
<p><strong>Razorback</strong>: None of the more popular trade names linked to the Pens seem to justify a first round pick – or a high end prospect. I know they are in a win-now situation (and this is a really nice team) so, put on your GM hat and tell me how would you proceed. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I think you go for it. That first-round pick will at worst be in the low 20s, which can be a crapshoot. I'd be hesitant to give up Calen Addison. But I would talk about anything else. This team is good, resilient and disciplined and has a real chance to go all the way this year, especially if they find someone who can replace a chunk of the production Jake Guentzel leaves behind.</p>
<p><strong>Rory</strong>: Question 2: If GMJR goes out and gets a replacement for Jake, can you explain what would happen if Jake was able to come back only in the playoffs; how does the replacement and Jake's contract impact the cap? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: They will need to have salary cap space for Jake's contract should he return, so that will be a consideration as the Pens proceed here. I think you can get around that if needed by dumping Galchenyuk somehow. Nick Bjugstad could also be dangled,.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong>: Casey DeSmith to Florida for a third...yay or nay ? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I think the Pens would have to entertain that, especially because they have Dustin Tokarski in the system, too.</p>
<p><strong>JS</strong>: If Justin Shultz comes back healthy and plays well, can’t we get a third or maybe 2nd rd lucj <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Probably, but as I said earlier in the chat, the Pens want to win now and dumping Schultz for a pick doesn't help there.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Do you think the pens could use some musc le <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Maybe a little, Joe. I don't think they need to go out of their way to add size and get away from their identity, but there are potential matchups (WAS, BOS) where size could be a worry.</p>
<p><strong>Razorback</strong>: Detroit looks like they are interested in unloaded folks – including Daley. Interesting addition or not? Any interest in LW Tyler Bertuzzi? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I don't think they need to add a blue-liner. I do think they would have interest in some of their speedy forwards like Bertuzzi (don't see him getting dealt but you never know) or Athanasiou. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Personally, I hope they don't add Athanasiou because that's a pain to spell. Getting Galchenyuk down was hard enough.</p>
<p><strong>AES</strong>: Matt: miss you on the Vikings beat, but the Penguins are much more pleasant to follow. Do you envision one G getting all the playoffs starts (barring injury, of course), or do you think Sully will be willing to take more of a world juniors approach and both Gs will get starts? Cheers. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Is this Mike Zimmer? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: AES, thanks for the kind words and for the question. I think the Penguins will try to play both guys here and let the best goalie win. I don't think they will want to alternate starts in the playoffs. I'm sure Sullivan will want to settle on a guy, though that goalie might not have a long leash. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I don't think it's a good idea to alternate starts in the playoffs. Kind of the whole "if you have two quarterbacks thing". You want to have a clear starter, even if you switch to the other goalie after a couple of shaky starts. That's just me, though.</p>
<p><strong>AES</strong>: Zim has enough on his hands without worrying about the Penguins. You may not have seen it, but Rhodes can't cover NFL receivers any more, which is something of problem, and Waynes/Alexander are UFAs. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Trae Waynes for Alex Galchenyuk? Who says no?&gt;</p>
<p><strong>burt reynolds</strong>: Is a first round pick this year worth as much as people seem to think it is? Pens will get a later pick as you mentioned and in general drafting 18 year olds is a bit of a risk <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Sorry for the delay, was trying to find a link to this story: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/06/17/Penguins-look-to-get-younger-while-keeping-title-window-open-6/stories/201906160155" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/06/17/Penguins-look-...</a> <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I wrote before last year's draft about how the Penguins had been trading away picks and prospects in pursuit of Cups. It was something that experts agreed they should do given that they have Crosby and Malkin and etc., but it also has let to them taking a hit in terms of their prospect pool. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: That story gets into the risk-reward. But you're right. Picking an 18-year-old with, say, the 27th pick is far from a sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">whats the attraction with Toffoli? Id much rather have Palmieri</span></span> <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I don't know that Palmieri is going to be available, especially to a division rival.</p>
<p><strong>JS</strong>: If Shultz comes back healthly, can’t we get at least a 3rd or maybe a 2nd for him as a rental - from Winnepeg or Toronto? Then we could trade our first and Galchenyuk for AThanasious and Trevor Daley to slot in on the third pair. The draft capital doesnt hurt as much and we get a dynamic player. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I don't think the Penguins should tinker with their D. The bottom pair was a problem last year and now they're looking at maybe Schultz and Jack Johnson as the third pair. That's good depth to have. I'd keep Schultz. If he signs somewhere after the year, oh well. Again, the Penguins want to win now and aren't going to do anything that runs counter to that. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Any more questions? Or is that all we've got for today?</p>
<p><strong>Ross</strong>: What time is practice today? Sully letting them sleep in? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Practice is at 4, presumably allowing guys to get back into town and settled in.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong>: Odds GMJR makes a deal by the Florida trip <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I have no idea. But he isn't one to wait until within 48 hours of the trade deadline. He likes to get ahead of the market and give the player more time to settle in. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Alright, that's it for today. Thanks for sending over questions. Some good ones today. We'll do this again soon, especially with the trade deadline right around the corner. Have a great day.</p>
