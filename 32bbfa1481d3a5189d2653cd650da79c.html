<h1>After challenging season in Buffalo, Evan Rodrigues ready to do whatever Penguins ask</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>LOS ANGELES — A challenging season for Evan Rodrigues coincidentally began in Pittsburgh. Now he hopes it ends there with a Stanley Cup victory lap.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old, acquired from the Buffalo Sabres on Monday, set career highs in goals and points while playing meaningful minutes for the Sabres in 2018-19. But before the puck dropped at PPG Paints Arena for the season opener, new Sabres coach Ralph Krueger informed Rodrigues that he would be a healthy scratch.</p>
<p>“It just started from the get-go,” he said Tuesday. “You never really get into the groove of things. You’re always playing almost not to make a mistake.”</p>
<p>Rodrigues pressed, trying to prove to Krueger that he should be in the lineup. But he was a healthy scratch 24 times and reportedly requested a trade.</p>
<p>The Sabres granted his wish Monday, trading Rodrigues and former Penguins winger Conor Sheary to Pittsburgh in exchange for Dominik Kahun.</p>
<p>“I went through the roof,” he said, calling the Penguins a “storied franchise.”</p>
<p>It also didn’t hurt that Sheary was one of his closest friends on the Sabres.</p>
<p>“It was awesome to just pick his brain [on their Monday flight to Los Angeles],” Rodrigues said. “It’s nice to have him here. … I didn’t find out he was part of the trade until it got on Twitter. So when I saw that, it was even more exciting.”</p>
<p>Rodrigues will make his Penguins debut Wednesday against the Los Angeles Kings. A day earlier, he practiced on a line with Patrick Marleau and Dominik Simon.</p>
<p>The Penguins figure to utilize him as a penalty killer down the stretch, especially with Zach Aston-Reese out. Rodrigues also has experience on the power play.</p>
<p>“I’ve always prided myself of being versatile,” he said. “I can play the wing, play center, play PP, PK. So whatever they need me to do, I’m going to do.”</p>
<p>Rodrigues, who initially broke into the league as an undrafted player from Boston University, scored nine goals with 20 assists last season. He played all over the lineup, including skating as the No. 1 center in a game against the Penguins. Last summer, an arbitrator awarded him with a $2 million salary for 2019-20.</p>
<p>Rodrigues had just three points, none of them goals, when the calendar flipped to 2020. In the 14 games after that, he scored five goals with one assist.</p>
<p>“I’ve really turned it on. The puck’s starting to go in for me and I’m starting to play the way I know I can play,” he said. “And I’m just looking to continue that.”</p>
<p>All three players added at Monday’s trade deadline are above-average skaters. Rodrigues thinks his game fits how Mike Sullivan’s Penguins want to play.</p>
<p>“It’s obviously a high tempo, a lot of speed and obviously a lot of skill in that lineup. I like to say I’m a speedy forward and have some skill,” said the 5-foot-11, 184-pound forward. “Hopefully I can just add to that mix, add to that group.”</p>
