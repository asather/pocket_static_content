<h1>Pittsburgh virtual choir gets wide viewership and national attention</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In just four days since it was posted, the video of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/faith-religion/2020/04/10/Churches-form-virtual-choir-for-Easter-anthem-coronavirus-covid-19/stories/202004100118" target="_blank">an Easter anthem by a Pittsburgh virtual choir</a> has drawn more than 182,000 YouTube hits.</p>
<p>It was released Friday after worship leaders from more than two dozen Pittsburgh-area churches — most of them recording by cell phone in their homes — sent in takes that were blended into a split-screen music video.</p>

<p>The anthem,&nbsp;“The Blessing,” was recorded to present an Easter message of hope and unity during the coronavirus shutdown, with most churches holding services online rather than in person. By Sunday afternoon, viewership of the video rose by a thousand every few minutes.</p>
<p>The video, based on biblical words of blessing, begins with single images of different singers before combining the singers, videoconference-style, as their voices swell to an anthemic conclusion.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Blessing project brought together more than dozen singers from churches, ranging in denomination, race, ethnicity and location throughout southwestern Pennsylvania. The project was organized in about two weeks by leaders at Allegheny Center Alliance Church and Amplify Church.</p>
<p>Alan Hannah, assistant lead pastor at Allegheny Center Alliance Church, &nbsp;said about&nbsp;40% of viewers reached the YouTube site from clicking on Facebook. links, with many others doing searches. (For at least a few hours on Sunday, “Pittsburgh Blessing” temporarily eclipsed “Pittsburgh Dad” as the first autofill suggestion in the YouTube window.)</p>
<p>The Post-Gazette’s original article on the choir, which embedded the video, also drew more than112,806 page views, and the anthem also received national TV coverage on Sunday news shows.</p>
<p>Mr. Hannah said more than 100 people emailed the project, many “expressing their thanks and some asking for help so they can do something similar at their church or city.”</p>
<p>He added: “The most powerful thing though has been the testimonies from people who have said what joy, hope, and peace it’s brought in the midst of uncertainty.”</p>
