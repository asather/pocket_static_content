<h1>'A lovely box of poo': Police investigate after dog feces mailed to Indiana Township car shop</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police are investigating after the owner of Dewey’s Auto Body in Indiana Township said he received a package Thursday containing dog feces.</p>
<p>The address on the box was handwritten and the return address referenced an old TV show, according to Dewey Spittler, the shop’s owner. When he opened the package, he found dog feces and a written message that read in part, “And show some respect, jag off,” Post-Gazette news partner KDKA-TV reported.</p>
<p>“Whenever I got it, I was kind of excited because it said in care of Dewey, private,” Mr. Spittler told KDKA. “... When I opened it up, it was a lovely box of poo, of dog poo.”</p>
<p>A postal tracking code was used to trace the box to the post office on Broad Street in East Liberty, according to KDKA. Cameras captured a picture of the suspect mailing the box.</p>
<p>Mr. Spittler’s family has owned the company since the 1970s and hasn’t had any problems or complaints.</p>
<p>“Who sent me a box of dog crap and why? I mean, what was the purpose of this?” Mr. Spittler told KDKA.</p>
<p>“Today, it’s dog poop through the mail,” Mr. Spittler’s son Eric added. “Tomorrow, it could be a pipe bomb or something more dangerous than what it is.”</p>
<p>Police and the postal inspector are investigating.</p>
