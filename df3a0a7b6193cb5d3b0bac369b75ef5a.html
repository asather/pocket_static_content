<h1>Zach Banner earns Steelers' starting right tackle job</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin announced after practice Wednesday that Zach Banner will start at right tackle against the New York Giants — the first time Banner has started an NFL game at that position.</p>
<p>It has been a long climb to the starting spot for Banner, who came to the Steelers as an overweight free agent in 2018 after being cut by three other teams.</p>
<p>But he worked himself into shape, lost more than 80 pounds and became an integral part of the Steelers’ short-yardage run game as a tackle-eligible player in 2019. When the Steelers moved right tackle Matt Feiler to left guard to compensate for the retirement of Ramon Foster, Banner and Chukwuma Okorafor were given the chance to have a training-camp battle for the open position.</p>
<p>Okorfaor has started four games in his first two seasons — three at tackle, one as a tackle-eligible tight end. Banner had one start — also at tight end.</p>
<p>Starting Banner in the season opener make sense, too, because his massive frame (6 foot 8, 335 pounds) will come in handy against Giants defensive end Dexter Lawrence (6-4, 342).</p>
