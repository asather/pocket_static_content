<h1>Allegheny County’s criminal court division turns to videoconferencing amid positive virus tests</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Following complaints from employees and attorneys about the rising number of positive COVID-19 tests among court staff in recent days, the criminal division of the Allegheny County court system will move to videoconferencing for as many hearings as possible from July 8-17.</p>
<p>The announcement was made late Tuesday after two additional employees — one in Pittsburgh municipal court and another in the probation office — tested positive.</p>
<p>That brings the number of positive cases of people who work in the courts to 12 since June 25.</p>

<p>Private defense attorneys complained recently that they were not formally notified by court administration of any of the positive test results, and instead were made aware only through word of mouth. They feared possible exposure and also resented not being told if they needed to quarantine.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, President Judge Kim Berkeley Clark and court administrator Chris Connors sent an email to the district attorney’s office and defense bar notifying them that for the next 10 days, videoconferencing should be used for as many proceedings as possible. Although that is already happening in the court’s other divisions, it was being used much less in criminal court.</p>
<p>“We understand that many of us are not ready to make such a quick transition to primarily remote hearings,” the email said. “Unfortunately, our current situation mandates such a change and we cannot wait until we are all ready. We need to start, learn from our mistakes and try to do better each day. I ask all of us in the criminal justice system to be patient and cooperative with each other during this difficult transition.”</p>
<p>The email notes that many, if not all, prosecutors will only participate via video. Defense attorneys and their clients will be permitted to go to the courthouse for in-person proceedings, the email said, but everyone is encouraged to use video.</p>
<p>Three attorneys in the DA’s office recently tested positive. Spokesman Mike Manko praised the decision to move to a primarily video format.</p>
<p>“District Attorney Zappala agrees with this decision and appreciates the court recognizing our situation and the safety issues and concerns for our staff and others who work in the courthouse,” he said.</p>
<p>The email also asked the judges in criminal court to liberally grant motions for continuance in cases where videoconferencing is not feasible.</p>
<p>“The goal during this period of time is not only to reduce traffic in the courthouse and to give the court time to further assess the situation in the COVID-19 criminal division but also to force us all to get comfortable with remote hearings,” they wrote. “This may be our ‘new normal’ in that it is unclear how this pandemic will develop. A very large portion of criminal cases are pleas which can easily be done remotely.”</p>
<p>The email urges all of the attorneys to practice using Microsoft Teams, the program used by the courts for videoconferencing so that they become comfortable with it, and to speak to clients, witnesses and opposing counsel to prepare for hearings ahead of time.</p>
<p>In addition, defendants, victims and witnesses are encouraged not to bring a large group of people with them to court if they appear in person. All people who enter the courthouse, according to a May order, are required to wear a mask.</p>
