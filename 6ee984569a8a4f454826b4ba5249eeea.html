<h1>Michigan insurance brokerage acquires part of Tulco, Thomas Tull's Pittsburgh tech company</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Michigan-based insurance brokerage has acquired part of Tulco LLC, the Pittsburgh tech company founded by entertainment billionaire and entrepreneur Thomas Tull.</p>
<p>Tulco, an investment holding company, works to bring technology, like artificial intelligence and machine learning, to companies in large industries.</p>
<p>The business aims to "provide the tools for companies around the world to become 21st century industries," Mayor Bill Peduto told the Post-Gazette in January 2018 when Mr. Tull <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business-top-stories/2018/01/11/Billionaire-Thomas-Tull-is-the-most-recent-transplant-to-Pittsburgh/stories/201801110122" target="_blank">announced Tulco would be headquartered in the city.</a></p>
<p>Acrisure, the insurance brokerage based in Grand Rapids, announced Wednesday it had acquired Tulco's insurance practice in order to incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities into product development, insurance sales and market processes.</p>
<p>The transaction is valued at $400 million, according to a Bloomberg report.</p>
<p>Already, the two firms had formed a yearlong partnership in 2019 when they launched Altway Insurance, a fully AI-backed brokerage.</p>
<p>Acrisure is also forming a new technology group, which Mr. Tull will chair.</p>
<p>Mr. Tull, who used to consider Pittsburgh his "adoptive hometown" when he lived in Los Angeles, is the former CEO of Legendary Pictures. He is also a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and owner of Rivendale Farms in Washington County.</p>
