<h1>WPIAL basketball playoffs: Fox Chapel's No. 2 seed causes debate</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After his team knocked off previously undefeated Fox Chapel Friday by a 15-point margin, Upper St. Clair coach Danny Holzer felt confident the win would put his team among the top three seeds for the WPIAL Class 6A playoffs and also give the Panthers a higher seed than Fox Chapel.</p>
<p>But when the WPIAL released the playoff brackets Tuesday night, Holzer was feeling miffed.</p>
<p>Despite the home loss to Upper St. Clair, Fox Chapel was given the No. 2 seed in Class 6A behind Butler. Mt. Lebanon was seeded third, Upper St. Clair fourth and Pine-Richland fifth.</p>
<p>The Upper St. Clair and Fox Chapel seedings were one of the most interesting things to come out of the WPIAL playoff meeting Tuesday night at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Green Tree. The league announced playoff pairings and seedings for the boys and girls playoffs, which begin Friday and conclude with championships over three days at Petersen Events Center Feb. 27-29.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Holzer was shaking his head at the brackets.</p>
<p>“We have proven by our record and who we beat that we are one of the top three teams in Class 6A and I don’t think there’s any question about that,” Holzer said. “I don’t think there’s any question that the top five teams were the top five teams all year. But if you look at those five teams, and base things on strength of schedule and strength of wins, I think Fox Chapel would’ve been the fourth or maybe even the fifth team.”</p>
<p>Every year, at least a few coaches grumble about their matchup or seeding. Holzer’s argument has some validity when you consider things like strength of schedule and the 15-point victory against Fox Chapel. Some other coaches wouldn’t go on the record, but they also questioned how Fox Chapel could be seeded ahead of Upper St. Clair.</p>
<p>Bill Cardone, Hampton athletic director and chairman of the basketball committee, said there was debate about where to seed Fox Chapel. But it wasn’t over whether Fox Chapel should be seeded below Upper St. Clair. It was about whether Fox Chapel or Butler should be seeded first.</p>
<p>“Fox Chapel had an undefeated season until a little non-section loss against Upper St. Clair,” Cardone said. “We didn’t feel that one non-section loss should bump them from where they were.”</p>
<p>Although Fox Chapel is 21-1, the Foxes played in what is considered the weakest of the three Class 6A sections. Of the six teams in Fox Chapel’s section, they haven’t had a WPIAL champ since Norwin in 1988. The six teams in Upper St. Clair’s section have eight titles since 1988. This year, Fox Chapel beat only two teams with 13 or more wins, including one against Penn Hills, the No. 1 seed in Class 5A.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Upper St. Clair (19-3) beat seven teams with 13 wins or more and owns wins against Allderdice ( the top team in the City League), Mt. Lebanon (No. 2 seed in the WPIAL), Mars (No. 3 seed in Class 5A) and Fox Chapel.</p>
<p>“All of a sudden, everyone wants to drop Fox Chapel to No. 4 [after the Upper St. Clair loss] because they lost one game,” Cardone said. “Upper St. Clair lost three games and Fox Chapel one. Due to the strength of what they did, we felt Fox Chapel deserved to be No. 2. I would think the Upper St. Clair game mattered, but I don’t think it mattered with the magnitude everybody thought it would.”</p>
<p>Fox Chapel was a section champ, while Upper St. Clair finished second to Mt. Lebanon in the section.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, I think winning sections should matter,” Fox Chapel coach Zach Skrinjar said. “If that [Upper St. Clair game] happened in December, would it have mattered? I just don’t like not letting section winners get the 1, 2 or 3 seeds.”</p>
<p>Cardone said the other most-debated subject was what team should be seeded No. 1 in Class 4A. That choice went to Highlands. The Rams tied Knoch for a section title, but Knoch was seeded second, Quaker Valley third and Uniontown fourth.</p>
<p>“Highlands has kind of been the No. 1 team all year,” Cardone said. “Knoch tied with them and split two games. We think Uniontown is a good team, but maybe their strength of schedule might not have been as good as Knoch and Highlands.”</p>
<p>The other No. 1 seeds in boys are Penn Hills (5A), Lincoln Park (3A), Our Lady of the Sacred Heart (2A) and Vincentian (1A).</p>
<p>The No. 1 seeds in girls are Bethel Park (6A), Chartiers Valley (5A), North Catholic (4A), Beaver (3A), Serra (2A) and Rochester (1A).</p>
<p>In one other interesting development concerning playoff sites, Robert Morris has expressed a desire to play host to some games at the new UPMC Events Center. Robert Morris hasn’t staged WPIAL games for more than a decade.</p>
<p>“We’re working with them to see if it would be a feasible site for us,” WPIAL associate executive director Amy Scheuneman said.</p>
