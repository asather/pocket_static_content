<h1>Seth Rogen's shot-in-Pittsburgh 'American Pickle' releases first trailer</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sure, it’s supposed to be Brooklyn, but we know better.</p>
<p>“An American Pickle,” the Seth Rogen feature film shot in Pittsburgh in late 2018 (yes, and in NYC) released its first trailer today. The movie comes out Aug. 6 on HBO Max.</p>
<p>The WarnerMax film, directed by Brandon Trost, is based on Simon Rich’s New Yorker novella. Rogen plays both Herschel Greenbaum as well as his great-grandson, Ben. After Herschel comes to America he falls into a vat of brine and emerges 100 years later, in 2020. He probably could have picked a better year…</p>
<p>The trailer shows a few Pittsburgh locations, including Liberty Avenue and a press conference shot in a church on the North Side.</p>
