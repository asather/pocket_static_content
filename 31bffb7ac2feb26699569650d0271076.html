<p>On the recruiting front, the state of Virginia has been bountiful to Pitt for the 2021 class, supplying the program with players coach Pat Narduzzi hopes can guide the Panthers to a prosperous future.</p>
<p>Coming off a holiday weekend, the state continued to be just that.</p>
<p>Running back Malik Newton, a three-star recruit from Lake Taylor High School in Norfolk, Va., committed to Pitt on Tuesday, becoming the 13th member of its 2021 recruiting class.</p>
<p>Of those 13 players, Newton became the fourth from Virginia, all of whom are from the Hampton Roads metropolitan area in the state’s southeast corner. Additionally, Newton is the second running back from Norfolk to join Pitt’s 2021 class, joining Rodney Hammond, who committed in November 2019. He becomes the second running back and ninth offensive player in the class.</p>
<p>At 5-11 and 215 pounds, Newton is ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 18 running back nationally in his class and the No. 8 prospect in Virginia.</p>
<p>In addition to Pitt, he held scholarship offers from, among others, Clemson, Penn State, West Virginia, Virginia, Virginia Tech, North Carolina, Louisville, Tennessee, Texas A&amp;M, Maryland, Purdue, Nebraska and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Prior to Newton’s commitment, Pitt had the No. 25 2021 recruiting class nationally, according to Rivals, placing it fifth among the ACC’s 14 programs.</p>
<p>While leading Lake Taylor to a state championship last season as a junior, Newton rushed for 2,060 yards and 32 touchdowns, the latter of which tied a South Hampton Roads single-season record. In his team’s 34-14 victory in the state title game, he rushed for 141 yards and had two touchdowns, one rushing and one receiving.</p>
<p>Newton’s success allowed him to share Abe Goldblatt all-Tidewater player of the year honors and prompted one coach, <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/757teamz/vp-sp-abe-goldblatt-poy-keandre-lambert-malik-newton-20191220-3q5jydlbtzf6xgl2khgss4q4ou-story.html" target="_blank">speaking to the Virginian Pilot</a>, to describe him as “a throwback player, Jim Brown-like. Big, fast, tough and durable.”</p>
<p>Narduzzi had revealed on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon that the program had received a commitment -- without stating who the player was, in adherence to NCAA rules -- and on Tuesday night, Newton unveiled his college choice on Instagram.</p>
