<h1>Derek Shelton says Cole Tucker will get a shot in the Pirates' outfield</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cole Tucker could be on the move.</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton said after the Pirates’ <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/18/Pirates-PNC-Park-baseball-Pittsburgh-Cleveland-Indians/stories/202007180080" target="_blank">5-3 exhibition loss</a> to the Indians on Saturday at PNC Park that the team plans to try Tucker, their first-round pick in 2014, in the outfield as a way to potentially get him a little more playing time.</p>
<p>“We’ve exposed him in the last couple days,” Shelton said. “I think there’s a chance that we could see him bounce around. He’s extremely athletic, which makes him versatile. If there’s a chance we could get him on the field in different spots, then I think we’ll probably try to do that.”</p>
<p>The Pirates haven’t determined whether Tucker would play left field, center or right. It’s been more about giving him a chance to try it out and see how he does with the position change/addition.</p>
<p>Shelton said Tucker, for the past two days, has been working with first-base coach Tarrik Brock, who oversees the Pirates’ outfielders.</p>
<p>With Adam Frazier and Kevin Newman entrenched in the middle infield, playing time was potentially scarce for Tucker, especially if they look to use Erik Gonzalez and JT Riddle — a pair of utility guys — as backups.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/17/Gregory-Polanco-tests-positive-for-COVID-19-pittsburgh-pirates/stories/202007170102" target="_blank">with Gregory Polanco (COVID-19) out</a>, there could be more opportunity for Tucker in the outfield if he’s able to handle the work.</p>
<p>“He’s a really good athlete, and he’s taken to it,” Shelton said. “He’s excited about being out there. He played second base [Saturday] because [young shortstop] Oneil [Cruz] was here. I think he has the ability to play all three with not much issue.”</p>
<p><strong>Walking wounded</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates trotted out an opening day-type lineup Saturday, with the lone exception being Newman.</p>
<p>Shelton said Newman was a little dinged up, and the manager made the decision to hold him out as a precaution.</p>
<p>“If this were next Friday in St. Louis, he would’ve played,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>Riddle did not participate in the game, as he, too, is not quite 100%. Shelton said Riddle took individual work before reporters entered the ballpark.</p>
<p>With catcher Luke Maile lost for the year, Shelton said catcher Andrew Susac will likely stick around in Pittsburgh for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>‘Wear your mask’</strong></p>
<p>Shelton did his postgame interview wearing a T-shirt featuring a masked Pirate. He said it’s going to be a theme for him this season — to wear something with meaning, perhaps directed toward some sort of charity.</p>
<p>“I think we’ll try to do something after games to try to represent different things that are going on,” Shelton said. “I think everybody should wear a mask. It’s important to wear a mask. We’ve kind of taken our logo and made it cool so I figured I would rock it for the first night here. So wear your mask.”</p>
