<h1>Jason Mackey's Life at Home: Heeding lessons from the Grateful Dead</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With apologies to William Shakespeare, Mark Twain or Ernest Hemingway, my favorite writer might actually be Robert Hunter, the longtime lyricist for the Grateful Dead.</p>
<p>Equal parts prolific and peculiar, Hunter once disappeared with a bottle of Retsina wine and returned a few hours later with three beautiful, iconic songs in hand, his psychedelic imagery every bit as important to the band’s success as Jerry Garcia’s guitar work.&nbsp;Hunter’s brilliance has been on my mind recently not just for “American Beauty,” the (most publicly identifiable) Dead masterpiece that housed those tunes, but for another song Hunter wrote named “Scarlet Begonias,” a poppy, upbeat romp that features this magnificent couplet:</p>
<p><em>Once in awhile you get shown the light</em></p>
<p><em>In the strangest of places if you look at it right</em></p>
<p>Sounds great, doesn’t it? It’s idyllic, poignant and beautiful. Especially when it comes to the point of this piece — what it’s like for someone who travels all the time to suddenly work predominantly from home.</p>
<p>The only problem is that, more than two months into this ordeal, I don’t know how much light I’ve actually seen.</p>
<p>Quite literally, too, which is another issue altogether.</p>
<p>I have learned that my wife oozes patience, for which I’m incredibly grateful. We have two boys, ages 6 and 19 months, and she’s (mostly) a stay-at-home mom. Yet even with two tiny tyrants calling most of the shots, the most laborious thing she does on a given day might easily be putting up with me and my neuroses.</p>
<p>What neuroses, you ask?</p>
<p>As anyone with kids knows, they’re not quiet. Many are actually allergic to silence. And when you’re trying to concentrate on something … let’s just say I should probably buy stock in Bose Corporation. But it’s not just the decibel level that has been a challenge. It’s the pace and lifestyle.</p>
<p>While many families struggle with the whole beat reporter thing — odd hours, ample travel and work — we love it.</p>
<p>As a family, we learned several years ago that I function better when busy and not obsessing over details at home after a season, oblivious the machine had been running fine for months before I started inspecting every part.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean an in-season pace the entire time, mind you, but we have learned that me being able to focus on something relative to work/sports/reporting helps burn off excess energy.</p>
<p>That’s why these past two-plus months have been a little more difficult. Because of the uncertainty surrounding everything, sure, but also that it’s almost eerily normal ... at least for us.</p>
<p>While I’d equate the normal person’s work life to that of a long-distance runner, covering a professional sport is more akin to sprints or middle distance (and on bad days, toppling face-first over hurdles).</p>
<p>The rhythm of it — say on a road trip — requires you to work, work, work, then finally take a break, either because it’s the offseason, the team isn’t actually doing anything or someone else on the beat takes over for a little while.</p>
<p>This has been a long, strange step back.</p>
<p>I’ve always joked with friends and family that I’d rather return to landscaping or bricklaying (what I did before journalism) than work 9-to-5 in an office somewhere, stuck at a desk where every day looks the same.</p>
<p>I’m not yet ready to start hauling logs or building retaining walls, but this style of reporting — virtual and devoid of results — isn’t my favorite. There’s no rush of writing on deadline. No dressing room or clubhouse to work. No planes to catch, hotels to book or stats to analyze.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. It has been nice to step back and write some features, help with news and tackle stories I wouldn’t otherwise get to, but many of the days are spent trying to navigate a lifestyle that can feel confining.</p>
<p>Two things have been at least somewhat helpful, and the first is a schedule. At either 8 or 9 a.m. on a work day, I’ll break off from whatever our family is doing at the time and start my “commute.”</p>
<p>Writing in the morning, before the day’s inescapable twists and turns, is always my preference. I like to save research, transcribing and planning — non-creative tasks — for the afternoon, when my brain shifts into a different gear before wrapping up around 4 p.m.</p>
<p>The problem here, of course, is that schedule rarely ever plays out.</p>
<p>Phone calls often arrive in the evening, especially if you try to run or take a shower. Chatter about baseball’s potential return has been omnipresent. Perhaps sleep the night before was a challenge — it’s hardly uncommon for me to be wide awake and flush with creative thoughts at 3 a.m. — and I’m late starting my day.</p>
<p>The good news is we have little use for set hours in this business. The bad news is we have little use for set hours in this business.</p>
<p>None of this is a complaint, mind you. I love what I do, where I work and the stuff I get to cover. But it’s hardly conducive to what’s often the most popular tip for working at home: keeping regular hours.</p>
<p>Another item on those lists involves creating a dedicated office space. That’s been a challenge for someone who routinely works out of airplanes/airports, hotels, coffee shops and press boxes. I don’t sit well as it is (see above), and I’ve learned that I really don’t sit well when it’s the same place every day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we did try to make this work. Shortly after arriving home from spring training — a crazy 18 hours I should write about some other time — we did buy a new desk, my wife and I (laughably) thinking we had this whole thing figured out.</p>
<p>It would go in our master bedroom, in a nook that previously housed my wife’s dresser. I’d have separation and a place to call my own. Sounds like a dream, right?</p>
<p>Not quite. There’s not enough light. I don’t feel even remotely creative up there. The desk isn’t as sturdy as a Starbucks table or even the dining room table. Between sleep and work, I spend 15 or 16 hours a day in our bedroom. It’s why I wish we had space for a first-floor office.</p>
<p>It’s also why I’ve been thinking of Hunter and “Scarlet Begonias,” hoping one day that I look at my at-home work space and suddenly start to see some light, the same as many of you, I’m sure.</p>
