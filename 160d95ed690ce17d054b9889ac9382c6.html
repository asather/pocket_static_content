<h1>Penguins believe fewer morning skates has led to more energy, focus and wins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>TAMPA, Fla. — Marcus Pettersson will stickhandle in a cold corridor inside Amalie Arena on Thursday morning. Teddy Blueger and others will kick around a soccer ball. Jack Johnson, like many 30-something dads, will hit the treadmill.</p>
<p>One thing that only a few Penguins players will do is step out onto the ice.</p>
<p>There are many factors the Penguins feel have led to them emerging as one of the top contenders in the Eastern Conference. Speed and hustle. Mental toughness. Star power and depth. Good goaltending. Adams-worthy coaching.</p>
<p>Go ahead and add the near-elimination of morning skates to that long list.</p>
<p>“I like the way the team’s doing it now. It seems to make sense,” general manager Jim Rutherford said Wednesday. “You can’t argue with the results.”</p>
<p>After bouncing the idea off of his coaching staff, the team’s trainers and strength and conditioning coaches, and Rutherford, coach Mike Sullivan decided going into the season that the Penguins would hold morning skates sparingly.</p>
<p>The lead-up to Thursday’s game against the Tampa Bay Lightning at Amalie Arena is a good example. The Penguins practiced hard Wednesday at the arena for about 45 minutes, the players working up a pretty good sweat. Thursday’s morning skate is so optional that participation is highly frowned upon.</p>
<p>Only the goalies, players who are expected to be healthy scratches Thursday night and any rehabbing players will take the ice for their scheduled 11:30 a.m. skate. Occasionally, a skater or two will pop out there for extra work.</p>
<p>You can count the number of full morning skates the Penguins have had on two hands. One typically requires special circumstances, like last Friday. They had eight days off over the All-Star break and Sullivan wanted to get in an extra skate before their first game back, a win over the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
<p>That the Penguins have stuck with this approach into February tells you they think it helps. Sullivan after Wednesday’s practice pointed to the energy and the focus his players collectively have had most nights as proof of that.</p>
<p>Sullivan, a former player, has long felt morning skates are “overrated.” Back in October, with perhaps the cleverest quote of his tenure, he made an analogy about his grandma cooking hams to point out that NHL teams have held morning skates for decades just because, well, that’s what they have always done.</p>
<p>Their origin is murky. Some reports have said the trend started after the Russians did morning skates during the Summit Series in 1972. Others point to Fred Shero, who coached the Flyers to Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975. Rutherford shrugged, guessing that the Montreal Canadiens might have started it.</p>
<p>Back in the day, when players weren’t as diligent about diets and training routines, the morning skate was one way to sweat an adult beverage or three out of their system. But that’s less of a concern on the road trips of today.</p>
<p>In recent years, a few coaches strayed away from morning skates. That included Columbus Blue Jackets coach and Sullivan pal John Tortorella, who, believe it or not, was willing to publicly share his opinion on them. This season, the Penguins are one of several teams that sparingly hold morning skates.</p>
<p>When Sullivan shared his new philosophy with the players in the fall, it was one of the rare moments this season that Bryan Rust was apprehensive.</p>
<p>“I was always a guy who always wanted to go on the ice. I think it was more of a mental thing to go out there and touch the puck,” Rust said. “But they started telling us, ‘You can’t go out there. We’re not going to go out there.’”</p>
<p>Hockey players are creatures of habit. Look no further than Sidney Crosby, who still wears the same stitched-up jock strap he wore in high school. Simply finding something else to do proved to be the biggest challenge for most guys.</p>
<p>“It was tough in the beginning,” Marcus Pettersson said. “But once you kind of find a routine, you get used to it. It’s a little bit different. But it’s nice. We all know what to do in the mornings to prepare ourselves to be the best at night.”</p>
<p>Whether the Penguins are at home or on the road, players are still required to show up at the arena the morning of a game. There is still a team meeting with video scouting. Players will still work up a sweat before crushing a healthy meal.</p>
<p>Instead of lacing up their skates, they get in an off-ice workout at the arena. Players indicated that they are given pretty wide parameters on what they are allowed to do to get their blood pumping and their systems up and running.</p>
<p>“Most teams skate between 12-15 minutes,” Sullivan said. “So what actually gets accomplished? You might get some touches of the puck, but it’s really more about an activation of your central nervous system. We can accomplish that off the ice, as well. So our strength and conditioning guys do a great job.”</p>
<p>Pettersson likes to lift lighter weights before stickhandling with a ball to wake up his hands. Blueger will play a game of “two-touch soccer” before doing some power jumps and dead lifts “to activate.” Zach Aston-Reese rides an exercise bike for 10-12 minutes before stretching and using foam rollers on his stiff, painful legs.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I don’t even need a shower after,” Aston-Reese said. “It’s nice.”</p>
<p>He said the new routine might be impactful from a mental fatigue standpoint, a point that later had several teammates nodding their heads. Most mornings, they spent more time putting equipment on and off then skating around in it.</p>
<p>“It would be funny,” Pettersson said, “to go a whole career and see how much time you spent taking your gear on and off. It’s 15 minutes. But it adds up.”</p>
<p>The new routine has also freed up a little more downtime for the players in the afternoon, even if just a half hour. That’s not enough time for them to pick up pottery or another new hobby. But it has allowed Johnson to spend a little extra time with his kids when in Pittsburgh and for Blueger to do more reading.</p>
<p>Or, as Aston-Reese hilariously speculated about hyper linemate Brandon Tanev, more time to “rock back and forth in his bed, waiting for the game to start.”</p>
<p>So, four months in, this is the new normal for Sullivan’s Penguins, who have used their seemingly endless energy to stay among the top four in the East. And some of their more skeptical players have been sold on life without morning skates.</p>
<p>“Things have been going well for us,” Rust said. “And apparently I was wrong.”</p>
