<h1>Fauci’s caution on schools reopening ‘not an acceptable answer’ to Trump</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/candidate/trump" target="_blank">President Donald Trump</a> voiced frustration Wednesday at the nation's top infectious disease specialist after he warned a day earlier against reopening schools and businesses too quickly.</p>
<p>"I was surprised by his answer, actually," Trump said when asked about <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/politics/anthony-fauci-trump-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Anthony Fauci's</a> warnings during <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2020/05/12/opinions/fauci-testimony-trump-administration-response-filipovic/index.html" target="_blank">televised congressional testimony</a> that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2020/05/12/politics/anthony-fauci-congress-hearing/index.html" target="_blank">reopening states too quickly could have dire consequences</a>.</p>
<p>"It's just -- to me it's not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools," Trump said.</p>

<p>During a Tuesday appearance before lawmakers on&nbsp;the Senate Health Committee, Fauci warned that students looking to return to campuses in the fall would likely not have a coronavirus vaccine available to them.</p>
<p>"The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate the reentry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far," he said.</p>
<p>Fauci suggested instead that schools open cautiously, and said in some places schools should remain closed in the fall.</p>
<p>He said if states reopen before meeting the criteria set out by the Trump administration, they risk reprisals of the outbreak.</p>
<p>In a contentious exchange, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who recovered after contracting COVID-19 earlier this year, told Fauci he was not the “end-all” for coronavirus decisions and argued that schools could reopen in the fall because the virus seems to have less dangerous consequences for children.</p>
<p>“We ought to have a little bit of humility in our belief that we know what’s best for the economy,” said Paul, an ophthalmologist. “And as much as I respect you, Dr. Fauci, I don’t think you’re the end-all. I don’t think you’re the one person that gets to make a decision.”</p>
<p>In response, Fauci said he never made himself out to be “end-all and only voice in this,” and stressed that his advice is limited to matters of public health.</p>
<p>He then pushed back against Paul’s justification for reopening schools.</p>
<p>“We better be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects,” Fauci said, referring to cases of children with the coronavirus who also developed a perplexing inflammatory syndrome.</p>
<p>"He wants to play all sides of the equation," Trump said of Fauci on Wednesday during a meeting with the governors of Colorado and North Dakota.</p>
<p>Trump has insisted in recent weeks that schools will reopen in the fall, despite schools and universities saying otherwise.</p>
<p>"We're opening our country. People want it open. The schools are going to be open," Trump said Wednesday in the Cabinet Room.</p>
