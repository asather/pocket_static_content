<h1>Sentencing Thursday for two accused in Carnegie Library rare book theft</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>During the first hour that rare-book senior appraiser and adviser Kerry-lee Jeffery was in the Oliver Room at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in April 2017 to do an audit of the rare books kept there, she said, her stomach dropped.</p>
<p>She and her colleagues were looking for “The History of the Indian Tribes of North America,” by McKenney and Hall, an iconic, plump set wrapped in three-quarter morocco, or goatskin.</p>
<p>What she found was a book whose sides were caving in on themselves.</p>
<p>“Without even handling it, we knew something was wrong,” she wrote in a letter to Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Alexander P. Bicket.&nbsp; “Taking it down and opening it carefully on the table revealed that it was merely a carcass: boards and spine and a few pages of text. The plates had been brutishly cut from the book, leaving only stubs.”</p>
<p>Ms. Jeffery’s is one of 30 letters submitted by the prosecution to the court in aid of sentencing Thursday for the two men accused of stealing and cannibalizing more than $8 million worth of rare books, maps and plates over 25 years.</p>
<p>The letters — from patrons, volunteers, former employees, trustees and staff — almost universally ask that the two defendants, Gregory Priore and John Schulman, go to prison and decry not just the financial impact of the crime, but the erosion of trust it caused in the library system itself.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh was insured by Traveler’s Insurance, and has received, to date, $6.5 million paid in three separate installments.</p>
<p>“The library will need to work to build its reputation and standing within the community and gain the trust of collectors and patrons,” wrote the appraisal group, Pall Mall Art Advisors. “The long-term effect is actually far greater than the value they may have lost in the tangible assets.”</p>
<p>Mr. Priore, 63, who served as the sole archivist and manager of the the library’s rare book room, pleaded guilty to theft and receiving stolen property in January. He admitted that he removed items — prosecutors allege a total of 300 were found to be missing — and then sold them to John Schulman, the owner of the popular Oakland book store, Caliban Book Shop.</p>
<p>Mr. Schulman, who police said would then sell the stolen items to collectors both online and in his store, pleaded guilty on the same day to receiving stolen property, theft by deception and forgery.</p>
<p>At the plea hearing in January, the prosecution withdrew all other counts against them, including criminal conspiracy.</p>
<p>Although the number of missing items was 300, the prosecution wrote, the parties’ plea agreement holds them liable for 19 items that were recovered during the investigation and returned to the library.</p>
<p>The value of those items, according to Pall Mall is just over $2 million.</p>
<p>The advisory guidelines for a first-degree felony call for a sentencing range of 9 to 16 months incarceration, and the prosecution is urging prison time for both men.</p>
<p>In asking for an aggravated sentence, Deputy District Attorney Brian Catanzarite wrote, “The scope, breadth and impact of the crimes perpetrated by John Schulman and Gregory Priore cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>“The devastating financial loss to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh pales in comparison to the irreparable damage that the defendants caused the community.”</p>
<p>But the defendants argued in sentencing memoranda filed with the court on Thursday that they should not serve any time.</p>
<p>Mr. Priore asks to be allowed to complete community service with a nonprofit organization in Hazelwood to feed those in need.</p>
<p>“Respectfully, the most effective way to correct or adjust a non-violent public harm is to create a space for meaningful public good. A sentence of incarceration does not serve the best interests of the library, the community or Greg,” attorney Patrick Livingston wrote. “Recognizing that he has a significant debt to repay to society, Greg has embarked on an in-depth spiritual quest that has led him to reconnect with his Catholic faith.”</p>
<p>Mr. Schulman’s attorney, Ember Holmes, argues that he’s already been punished enough.</p>
<p>“Mr. Schulman built his entire career within the rare and antiquated book industry, and deeply regrets that he has undermined this career and violated the trust of his colleagues and the public,” Ms. Holmes wrote. “However, we would also request that this honorable court take into consideration the consequences that Mr. Schulman has already suffered as a result of his actions. He has lost the respect of many of his peers, and has been repeatedly humiliated in the media and on the internet.”</p>
<p>The document continues: “He has been vilified on various platforms internationally, largely due to the sensationalized and baselessly inflated value of the property in question. Mr. Schulman has been shamed, ridiculed, denigrated, and mocked, and his reputation has been irreparably damaged in the minds of many people. He has been the subject of hundreds of articles, resulting in thousands of hateful comments, some even calling for his execution. His life will truly never be the same. He will live the remainder of his life as a convicted felon, carrying that stigma around with him in everything he does.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>According to the prosecution, as long as 25 years ago, the two men reached an agreement in which Mr. Priore would remove items from the Oliver Room, which contained 30,000 unique and valuable items, and give them to Mr. Schulman, to sell. In return, Mr. Schulman, 56, paid him.</p>
<p>In 2017, Pall Mall Art conducted an audit on the library’s rare book room that led to the discovery of the missing items.</p>
<p>When questioned by library staff, Mr. Priore denied involvement. But when investigators arrived at his house to do a search on Aug. 24, 2017, Mr. Priore admitted that he would remove individual plates — illustrated pages — from books, as well as maps, put them n manila folders and walk out of the library. Larger items, he said, he would roll up, and books he simply carried out.</p>
<p>Mr. Priore estimated to police he removed as many as 200 maps and pictures and told detectives that “I should have never done this. I loved that room, my whole working life, and greed came over me.</p>
<p>“I did it, but Schulman spurred me on.”</p>
<p>When investigators searched the Caliban Book Shop Warehouse in Wilkinsburg over a nine-day period that summer, they recovered 42 of the missing items.</p>
<p>According to the initial criminal complaint, bank records showed Mr. Pirore received 56 checks from Caliban Book Shop from Jan. 1, 2010, through Sept. 1, 2017, totaling $117,000. There were also cash deposits of $17,000.</p>
<p>But Mr. Priore told investigators that Mr. Schulman earned much more money than he did.</p>
<p>“It was Priore’s belief that Schulman received significantly more money when he sold the item, and that he was only receiving about half of the worth of the item sold,” detectives wrote following their interview with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Priore began working at the library in 1985 and was moved to the rare books room about six years later.</p>
<p>At that time, his attorney wrote, the collections in the room were “badly neglected, damaged, worn and, indeed, filthy.”</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston goes on at length in his client’s memorandum describing the terrible state of the collection and accusing the library system of having little or no interest in the rare books it had.</p>
<p>“It does not minimize Mr. Priore’s enduring remorse or his acknowledgment of accountability to stress that the economic values of the collections were substantially diminished before he was even assigned as their custodian,” Mr. Livingston wrote. “Furthermore, while undoubtedly creating an opportunity that Mr. Priore wrongfully exploited, treating these culturally significant materials carelessly, and warehousing them over an extended time, is inconsistent with how a holder of a valuable public asset would meet its duty to the public, and contributes significantly to any public harm that may have resulted from their loss.”</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston went on to say that no library staffer was ever told to integrate any of the Oliver Room items into programming or events there, and instead used it as&nbsp;“the Library’s attic, and the materials placed there, while possibly a stop on one of Mr. Priore’s tours or available for interested scholars and patrons who sought them out, largely collected dust.</p>
<p>“Under these circumstances, to suggest that Mr. Priore’s conduct injured a cultural or public interest any more than did the library’s own haphazard, reclusive treatment of these materials would to be to disregard facts as they actually exist.”</p>
<p>Mr. Priore’s sentencing memorandum quotes extensively from a 1991 audit of the library’s rare-books collection completed by Schoyer’s Books in Squirrel Hill.</p>
<p>The appraisers wrote that “‘most of the books now in the [then-] Wadsworth Room were on open shelves in a non-environmentally controlled environment during an era of heavy pollution. Many of the books were among the dirtiest that we have handled.’”</p>
<p>Schoyer’s noted that books with value were carelessly handled; original bindings were rebound in library buckram cloth, and others had been subjected to “‘amateur repairs.”</p>
<p>The appraisal process then took five months and led to a 23-page report. Mr. Livingston noted that Schoyer’s used the fair market value for the items reviewed, versus Pall Mall ‘s valuation during its recent audit using the highest replacement value.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Priore and Mr. Schulman in their sentencing briefs challenge the estimated value of loss presented by Pall Mall and prosecutors.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Livingston wrote — and submitted letters from Mr. Priore’s wife and four children to emphasize — that his client has remorse for what he did, and that his motivation was “to stay afloat,” as he was “bearing a financial burden greater than he could afford,” in paying for private school and college.</p>
<p>He added that Mr. Priore has never lived “ostentatiously or pretentiously.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In their filing, Mr. Schulman’s attorneys outline their client’s background — growing up in Pittsburgh and becoming interested in antiquarian books in high school, where he began collecting and selling rare books for spending money. Mr. Schulman graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1987, where he studied English and German and earned a master’s in education there in 1990. He taught at Pitt until 1995.</p>
<p>Mr. Schulman opened Caliban books in 1991, his attorney said, and grew it into one of the most beloved bookstores in Pittsburgh, at the same time building his own national and international reputation in the field of rare and collectible books.</p>
<p>He joined the Antiquarian Book Sellers Association of American in the early 1990s and eventually served as the chair of its internet and ethics and standards committees.</p>
<p>Mr. Schulman also did appraisals of collections for the PBS program, “Antiques Roadshow.”</p>
<p>His attorneys wrote that he is known to be generous and have a “benevolent character in all regards,” noting that he has donated thousands of books to local libraries for fundraising and that he and his family volunteered in Haiti after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake in 2010.</p>
<p>Accompanying Mr. Schulman’s court filing were nine letters of support from the community. Included among them are a letter from retired Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge R. Stanton Wettick Jr., whose daughter has been best friends with Mr. Schulman’s wife since kindergarten, as well as letters from customers and fellow book sellers.</p>
<p>“His current legal troubles are incomprehensible to me because, over our 35-year association, I have never known him to be anything but a generous, considerate and caring man who does not in the least resemble the criminal portrayed by his accusers and by the national media,” wrote Gregory Gibson, of Ten Pound Island Book Company.</p>
<p>Another friend, D. Mark Possanza, wrote that Caliban has been an “invaluable asset to the community,” and a “tremendous resource” for faculty and students in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“The shop is also a hub for the city’s vibrant literary scene,” he wrote. “John’s shop is an amazing community asset . . . and ultimately is an expression of John’s good character and his efforts to be a good citizen.”</p>
<p>Mr. Possanza also wrote about redemption.</p>
<p>“We all stray from the straight and narrow (it’s been happening since the garden of Eden),” he wrote. “And when we do, we always have the hope of redeeming ourselves with actions that demonstrate our consciousness of the need to put things right.”</p>
<p>Mr. Schulman’s attorneys noted in their sentencing memorandum that their client did not plead guilty to any involvement in a conspiracy with Mr. Priore.</p>
<p>“Therefore, any reference to any theft from the Carnegie Library is irrelevant and immaterial to Mr. Schulman's matter, and we would request that any such reference not be considered in fashioning Mr. Schulman's sentence.”</p>
<p>Too, they told Judge Bicket that traditional incarceration is not necessary —&nbsp;whether to protect the community, achieve rehabilitation or deter future crimes. He has already paid $162,488.27 in restitution.</p>
<p>“Mr. Schulman wants to continue making things right with his former customers, and focus his attention on moving forward with his family in this new world they must now navigate.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As part of the prosecution’s sentencing memorandum, Mr. Catanzarite argued that the defendants betrayed “their professions, their colleagues, the antiquarian book community, the patrons of [the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh] and Caliban and the citizens of Allegheny County.”</p>
<p>He urges Judge Bicket to order the men to prison — a sentence in the aggravated range — commensurate with the impact of their crime.</p>
<p>“The loss of these items has deprived future generations of historical educational materials that simply cannot be replaced,” Mr. Catanzarite wrote. “These defendants committed a two decades-long fraud on the public, on charitable assets, and on the very ideals which each of them committed to uphold.”</p>
<p>The court filing also noted that Mr. Schulman has not assisted the government in trying to recover the stolen items. But it also goes on to say that Mr. Priore, wrongly, wants the court to believe that he was simply a pawn to Mr. Schulman’s scheme.</p>
<p>“But Schulman did not put those books in Priore’s hands. Priore had the power over the room and over the items. He could have stopped this theft at any time,” the prosecutor wrote. “With an exacto knife, Priore systematically dismantled centuries-old collections of art, maps and scholarly works, and along with them the standing and prosperity of one of Western Pennsylvania’s most treasured institutions.”</p>
<p>Linda Barsevich, director of finance and administration at the library, in a letter to the court, said that, despite the insurance payout, the library has not been made whole.</p>
<p>“The theft can’t only be measured in pure financial terms,” she wrote. “This isn’t a simple white-collar crime. This illegal and immoral operation was clearly planned out in advance, then executed and concealed over decades.”</p>
<p>She told Judge Bicket that for months, she worked in the room that became the crime scene, alongside the rare book appraisers.</p>
<p>“It was appalling to open a cabinet in the Oliver Room and find only the remains of a book — a shell of just the cover and binding with the insides of the book cannibalized.”</p>
<p>Jacalyn Mignogna, the coordinator of conservation, preservation and access at the library, did the same.</p>
<p>“[O]n the day of discovery, after opening volume upon volume and realizing that the once beautiful engraved plates printed on gilt-edges leaves or sepia photographs were now neatly cut out and removed, I had to sit down. I felt ill,” she wrote. “I went back to my office and wept.</p>
<p>“No longer could anyone be overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of these magnificent books.”</p>
<p>Additional letters were sent by library board trustees, patrons and librarians from other organizations.</p>
<p>Kornelia Tancheva, Hillman University librarian and director at the University of Pittsburgh, urged Judge Bicket to sentence the men to prison to send a message that a crime like theirs has consequences.</p>
<p>“The theft of special collections from any library, but especially from a public library, is an egregious crime against the integrity of the cultural record and against the public good,” she wrote.&nbsp;“It compromises the public trust in cultural institutions and sets a precedent that goes against everything that libraries stand for — unfettered access to information for all, curation and preservation of materials important not just now but for the whole future of humanity, as well as public support for cultural institutions.”</p>
