<p>Entercom, which owns four radio stations in the Pittsburgh area, raised enough funds to provide more than 1.5 million meals through the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;“Feed the Need RadioThon,” featuring on-air talent and guests, ran from 7 a.m.-5 p.m. to benefit displaced workers utilizing emergency drive-up distribution, as well as food pantries in the region.</p>
<p>Among the visitors on 1020 KDKA-AM, 93.7 The Fan, 100.7 Star (WBZZ-FM) and Y108 (WDSY-FM) were&nbsp;“American Idol” finalist Gabby Barrett, Grammy winner Dan Smyers of Dan + Shay, former Steelers wide receiver Santonio Holmes, country artist Lee Brice and University of Pittsburgh men’s basketball coach Jeff Capel.</p>

<p>“It’s days like today that make you so proud to be a Pittsburgher,” Michael Spacciapolli, senior vice president and market manager at Entercom Pittsburgh, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“On behalf of our amazing team at Entercom Pittsburgh, I want to thank the entire city for stepping up to help our neighbors in need.”</p>
<p>“We are so grateful for the support today from Entercom and its vast network of listeners and partners,” said Lisa Scales, president and CEO of the&nbsp;Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. “This is a testament to what we can do as a community in times of crisis.”</p>
<p>The initiative, which had a goal of 100,000 meals, was part of the companywide “Stay Connected” campaign that aligns its crisis efforts in producing impactful and compelling content, promotions and partnerships to support local communities. Listeners donated online and through text and phone.</p>
