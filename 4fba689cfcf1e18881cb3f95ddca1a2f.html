<h1>Ohio issues ‘stay at home’ order</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS — Ohio on Sunday joined California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey in <a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/local/Coronavirus/2020/03/22/ohio-coronavirus-numbers-continue-to-climb/stories/20200322105" target="_blank">ordering that residents “stay at home”</a> unless they have legitimate reasons to be outside while the nation continues to fight the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>The stay-at-home order issued by Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton at the request of Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, takes effect at 11:59 p.m. Monday and will last until at least April 6. During this time individuals and families are barred from leaving their residences, except when they’re performing essential activities like picking up groceries or medicine, or taking taking care of family, friends or pets in another household that need help. The order also allows people to leave their homes for outdoor activities like walking, hiking and running, so long as they follow rules of social distancing.</p>
<p>Ohio’s order also requires that ‘non-essential’ businesses and operations must cease everything but minimum basic work.</p>
<p>“For clarity, businesses, including home-based businesses, may continue operations consisting exclusively of employees or contractors [working from home],” the order states.</p>
<p>The restrictive measures could last longer than April 6, depending how much of a threat is still posed then by the lethal strain of coronavirus that has already become the world's worst pandemic in decades.</p>
<p>"I don't know any other way to describe this, except we are at war. and in war, we have to make sacrifices," Mr. DeWine said near the beginning of Sunday's hourlong news conference.</p>

<p>Also known as a "shelter-in-place" order in other states, Ohio's "stay-at-home" directive follows essentially the same guidelines: exceptions are made for essential personnel, such as doctors and nurses, and occasional trips to purchase food or supplies are fine.</p>
<p>The new state order also limits children at day care centers to six per room, with no common area for crossover interaction as a larger group. That order will stay in effect until at least April 30. Temporary pandemic child care licenses will be required of all day care centers by Thursday.</p>
<p>Essential businesses are encouraged to remain open. Such businesses are defined in the order as:</p>
<p>• Health care and public health operations;</p>
<p>• essential government and infrastructure functions;</p>
<p>• stores that sell groceries and medicine;</p>
<p>• organizations that provide charitable and social services;</p>
<p>• religious entities;</p>
<p>• media, including newspapers, and television and radio stations;</p>
<p>• gas stations and businesses needed for transportation;</p>
<p>• financial and insurance institutions;</p>
<p>• hardware stores;</p>
<p>• trade-based businesses, like construction companies, plumbers and electricians;</p>
<p>• postal and shipping services;</p>
<p>• educational institutions;</p>
<p>• laundry services;</p>
<p>• restaurants, provided food is only consumed off-premises;</p>
<p>• businesses that sell supplies to work from home;</p>
<p>• businesses that make supplies for other essential services;</p>
<p>• transportation services, like airlines and taxis;</p>
<p>• home-based and residential facilities that provide shelter and care for children, the elderly, or adults with disabilities;</p>
<p>• professional services like law firms and accounting firms;</p>
<p>• critical labor unions;</p>
<p>• hotels motels,</p>
<p>• funeral homes.</p>

<p>Officials once again urged residents not to hoard food and supplies, and they said fast-food restaurants and other establishments can continue to provide take out services.</p>
<p>"There's nothing in that order I have not been asking you to do for the last week or so," Mr. DeWine said, although he also made clear in his remarks that he believes it is time for Ohioans to double down and heed the recommendations against being around large crowds of people.</p>
<p>"We are in an absolutely crucial time," Mr. DeWine said. "Time is of the essence."</p>
<p>Dr. Acton echoed those remarks.</p>
<p>"It is absolutely essential we don't do this in a piecemeal way in Ohio or around the country," she said. "There's no time left. Listen to what Italy is telling us. Today is the day."</p>
<p>Though this particular strain of virus originated in China, Italy has become far and away the world's leader in casualties with Spain also incurring a significant number of deaths. In northern Italy, where the world's worst outbreak has occurred, streams of military vehicles have been shown on American television hauling dead bodies to crematoriums now burning corpses 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>"This is not a joke. This is not a drill. We all need to limit exposure," Dr. Acton said. "This the time you will see quiet descend on our country. These are the times that are really calling on us. I know it's hard getting our heads around it. But this is the time we really have to."</p>
<p>When asked what penalties might be imposed on violators, Gov. DeWine said that has not been determined.</p>
<p>"This was not designed to be punitive, but it's not just a recommendation, either," he said. "It is a health order."</p>
<p>Coronavirus cases are still on the rise in many parts of the world except China, and are not expected to peak until mid-April or mid-May.</p>
<p>In Ohio, there are now 351 confirmed cases in 40 counties — a figure Dr. Acton calls the "tip of the iceberg." Five are from Lucas County.</p>
<p>The total is up 104 from the 247 total confirmed cases the state counted in 33 counties Saturday, with a new case in Lucas County.</p>
<p>The state's death toll remains at three, with the deceased being from Lucas, Cuyahoga, and Erie counties. Many more fatalities are expected.</p>
<p>Mark Wagoner, Sr., of Springfield Township, became Ohio's first coronavirus fatality when he died last Wednesday. Tests results on Friday confirmed his death was from that virus.</p>
<p>Wood County confirmed its first two cases Sunday afternoon, a couple in their 60s who live in that country and recently traveled to Europe.</p>
<p>Hancock County on Sunday also confirmed its first case, one involving a 21-year-old female resident. Officials did not say how she may have contracted the virus.</p>
<p>As of Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than 15,200 total cases — both presumptive and confirmed — and 201 deaths across America.</p>
<p>One of the most recent high-profile figures who have tested positive is U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.). Other high-profile figures include actor Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, who were recently discharged from an Australia hospital.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine, Dr. Acton and Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted urged residents to take the pandemic more seriously, but not panic.</p>
<p>"We are ohioans, we're buckeyes, we're strong, we can do this, we can get through this," Mr. DeWine said.</p>
<p>Mr. Husted said he has been in close contact with groups such as the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation and major businesses. Their advice was used to help develop the stay-at-home order, he said.</p>
<p>And while the coronavirus is wreaking havoc on the economy, several major food and supply outlets - Meijer, Kroger, WalMart, and Giant Eagle among them - have announced they are hiring more people to help get the state through the crisis, Mr. Husted said.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine, a father of eight children, also used the news conference as an opportunity to inject a little humor about his own family.</p>
<p>"I'm an optimist," he said. "My wife, Fran, says anyone with eight kids is by definition an optimist."</p>
