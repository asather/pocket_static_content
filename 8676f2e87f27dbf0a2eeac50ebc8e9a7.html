<h1>Mars nicks section leader Shaler with Michael Carmody back in lineup</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Mars lost to Shaler in Decem­ber, Mi­chael Car­mody didn’t play for Mars be­cause of an in­jured toe. When Mars lost to Hamp­ton last week, Car­mody didn’t play be­cause he was in Hawaii, prac­tic­ing for a foot­ball all-star game.</p>
<p>But Car­mody is back&nbsp;— and so is Mars.</p>
<p>Mars hosted Shaler Tues­day night in a matchup of two of the top WPIAL Class 5A teams and Shaler’s ob­jec­tive, be­sides win­ning, was to neu­tral­ize Car­mody. He’s a se­nior Planet who, at 6-7, 290 pounds, might be close to the size of a planet.</p>
<p>Car­mody got only eight shots and scored 10 points, but he had a se­ri­ous im­pact on the game, just with his pres­ence, lead­er­ship and re­bound­ing. Three other Mars play­ers scored in dou­ble fig­ures and the Plan­ets knocked off Shaler, 74-61, in a Sec­tion 3 game.</p>
<p>The win puts Mars (11-3, 6-2), the de­fend­ing WPIAL 5A champion, back in the thick of the race for an eighth con­sec­u­tive sec­tion ti­tle. Shaler (11-5, 8-1) leads the section.</p>
<p>Car­mody, a Notre Dame foot­ball re­cruit, fin­ished with 18 re­bounds and also mis­di­rected a num­ber of shots on the in­side from Shaler.</p>
<p>“By no means is he the best bas­ket­ball player in the WPIAL, but I think he’s the most dom­i­nant force in the WPIAL,” said Rob Car­mody, Mi­chael’s father and Mars’ coach.</p>
<p>Shaler coach Rod Nei­de­berger echoed the same thoughts.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I think be­sides [But­ler’s] Ethan Mor­ton, he’s as dom­i­nant as any kid in the WPIAL right now,” Nei­de­berger said. “I think Mekhi is right there, too.”</p>
<p>Nei­de­berger was speak­ing of his own point guard, se­nior Mekhi Rey­nolds, who was splen­did with seven&nbsp;3-point­ers and 32 points (12 of 26 from the field). Rey­nolds made a few long 3-point­ers seem­ingly from Cran­berry. But Chris White, who had 14 points, was the only other Shaler player in dou­ble fig­ures.</p>
<p>“Mi­chael gives us some­thing that most teams don’t have,” Rob Car­mody said. “If you have to guard him with two peo­ple and we shoot it the way we did in this game ... I used the word ‘wow’ with our guys af­ter­ward be­cause we had not seen this be­fore.”</p>
<p>Mi­hali Sfanos, a ju­nior guard, con­tin­ued his re­cent stel­lar play with 27 points, in­clud­ing four 3-point­ers. He scored 15 of his points in the first half as Mars took a 30-22 lead into the break.</p>
<p>Mars also got 19 points from soph­o­more Chris Dvorak and 14 from soph­o­more guard Zach Schle­gel.</p>
<p>“Shaler had a good game plan, dou­bling me most of the time,” Mi­chael Car­mody said. “But our other guys stepped up and it’s awe­some to see that. I’d say this was the best game we played this year. It maybe wasn’t my best game over­all. But as a team, it was our best game.”</p>
<p>Mars led by six points af­ter the third quar­ter and went on a 10-2 run early in the fourth quar­ter to take con­trol of the game.</p>
<p>Despite the loss, Shaler still is in con­trol in the sec­tion and the Ti­tans are look­ing to win their first sec­tion ti­tle since 2012.</p>
<p>“Look, Mars was the mea­sur­ing stick,” Nei­de­berger said. “It’s never easy to play here and it was any­one’s game for a lit­tle bit. I think Mars is go­ing to be right there at the end. Penn Hills is there, too. But I think we are, too.”</p>
<p>For­tu­nately for Mars, Mi­chael Car­mody is there again.</p>
