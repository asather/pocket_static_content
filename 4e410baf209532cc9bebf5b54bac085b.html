<h1>Iconic voices of Dylan, Neil, Willie and Bruce bring us comfort during pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Bob Dylan was going through an erratic phase in the studio while playing some uninspiring greatest-hits shows in the late&nbsp;‘80s, he attracted a new generation of fans by aligning with the Grateful Dead and subsequently launching his Never-Ending Tour.</p>
<p>He was already four decades into this masterful career, and those just jumping on the bandwagon probably figured they’d get a few more good years out of a singer heading into his 50s.&nbsp;Instead, it’s turned out to be the best deal ever on a used legend. Here we are in 2020 and Dylan has given us a new album, at 79.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, down in Austin, Tx., an 87-year-old Willie Nelson sees that and says, “hold my weed” — you know, Willie’s version of “hold my beer.” Last week, he released “First Rose of Spring,” bringing his album total to an unheard-of 70.</p>
<p>And they are not the only legends from the 1960s and ’70s keeping us comforted and entertained during the most grueling year of our lifetimes. At&nbsp;his sprawling estate in Colorado, Neil Young dug deep into his archives to unearth the “lost” album “Homegrown” while keeping us cozy with his “Fireside Sessions,” some of the best live stream performances to be found on the interwebs.</p>
<p>And then there’s The Boss. Coming off his Broadway sessions, last year Bruce Springsteen took a career turn with “Western Stars,” a sweeping, majestic album that was like watching an old western. During the pandemic, he’s been spending time with us as a DJ on Sirius XM’s E Street Radio with his “From My Home to Yours” series</p>
<p><strong>‘Rowdy’ Dylan</strong></p>
<p>True to form, Dylan, the cantankerous one, has given us the most to grapple with on “Rough and Rowdy Ways,” his 39th album. After an unlikely three-album dip into the American Songbook — most recently 2017’s “Triplicate” —&nbsp;Dylan has more or less picked up where he left off on 2012’s “Tempest.”</p>
<p>Rock’s greatest songwriter plays the grumpy old geezer to perfection, pulling us into a claustrophobic realm where he holds court on matters of life and morbidity with his ghostly, nicotine growl.</p>
<p>Where Dylan’s poetry once soared on transcendent, sing-along melodies, they’re now constricted in vamps and repetitive 12-bar blues patterns, with occasional lyrics that wouldn’t be out of place on a gangsta rap album: “Put out your hand / There's nothing to hold,” he declares on “False Prophet.”</p>
<p>Dylan taps into the absurdist freestyling of his younger days. But the mood is so dour, so oppressive, it might take a few attempts to get through the first five songs, let alone the full 70 minutes, without taking a breather.</p>
<p>This far into his career — 500-some songs since 1961 — he comes up with one of his strangest yet with “My Own Version of You,” fantasizing about assembling a Frankenstein monster in which he can see the whole history of the human race, from Freud to Marx to Scarface to Leon Russell.</p>

<p>Looming at the end, 53 minutes in, is the longest song of his career, the 17-minute “Murder Most Foul,” dropped into the early days of the pandemic shutdown as a surprise first taste of the album. Intertwining a graphic retelling of the JFK assassination with an homage to American song, as requested to Wolfman Jack, it’s a bizarre, imaginative concept for a song. Somehow it works, as it offsets one of the nation’s great tragedies with the culture that sprung up and thrived around it.</p>
<p>Although he did once tell the old guard to get out of the way, Dylan never sang anything about hoping to die before he got old. He sang, “I was so much older then, I’m younger than that now.” And here he is, like Monet or Verdi, working well into his senior years.</p>
<p>With “Rough and Rowdy Ways” landing at No. 2 on the charts, Dylan becomes the first act to chart at least one top 40 album in every decade since the 1960s, according to Billboard. That makes seven. Seven decades.</p>
<p>While critics have clamored to sing its praises, “Rough and Rowdy Ways” has its detractors on fansites and reddit pages. Industry analyst Bob Lefsetz, who publishes the popular Lefsetz Letter, wrote, “Come on, just try to listen to listen all the way through to ‘Rough and Rowdy Ways,’ I DARE YOU!”</p>
<p>It’s certainly not designed for the easy listening charts.</p>
<p><strong>Young’s&nbsp;‘Homegrown’</strong></p>
<p>Young, one of Dylan’s few artistic peers, has been there for us in multiple ways during the pandemic, most notably gifting us the long-lost album he had deemed “too personal” to release as his sixth solo record in 1975.</p>
<p>Young was so fertile at the time that “Homegrown” —&nbsp;completed and ready with cover art —&nbsp;was shelved in favor of something else he had lying around: the brilliant, unreleased “Tonight’s the Night.” This was all while he was also going through a difficult break with actress girlfriend Carrie Snodgress.</p>
<p>“I apologize,” Young wrote on his Archives page. “This album Homegrown should have been there for you a couple of years after ‘Harvest.’ It’s the sad side of a love affair. The damage done. The heartache. I just couldn’t listen to it. I wanted to move on. So I kept it to myself, hidden away in the vault, on the shelf, in the back of my mind…. But I should have shared it. It’s actually beautiful. That’s why I made it in the first place. Sometimes life hurts. You know what I mean. This is the one that got away.”</p>
<p>Five of the songs, including “White Line,” “Star of Bethlehem” and “Love is A Rose,” would later be reworked and unveiled in their own glorious ways, but this is the opportunity to hear them as is, in context with seven other unreleased tracks in what it amounts to, unsurprisingly, an essential Neil Young album from that era.</p>
<p>Incidentally, at the time, Dylan was in the midst of his heart-wrenching series of Sara breakup albums that included “Blood on the Tracks” in 1975, so he did not have those same concerns.</p>
<p>“Homegrown” does have its raw, tender points, starting with “Separate Ways” and ending with “Star of Bethlehem.” But in between it has its own rough and rowdy ways, with the jubilant stoner title track and the jealous blues rocker “Vacancy.”</p>
<p>In one of the true highlights of this quarantine, we’ve gotten to see Young play “Homegrown” and other songs ... to his chickens!</p>

<p>Over the past few months, the 74-year-old has handled streaming better than anyone with his stripped-down <a href="https://neilyoungarchives.com/" target="_blank">“Fireside Sessions,”</a> artfully captured by his wife, Daryl Hannah. In the latest, the “Porch Episode,” he applies his ageless voice to Dylan’s “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” while revisiting his own catalog to address relevant issues of race (“Alabama” and “Southern Man”), protest (“Ohio”) and politics (“The Campaigner”).</p>
<p>He also reboots his 2006 Bush critique “Lookin’ for a Leader” as an attack on President Trump for building walls that divide the nation and dismissing Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p><strong>Willie’s&nbsp;‘Rose’</strong></p>
<p>Like Dylan, Nelson’s sweet, leathery voice is so iconic, so evocative, he can practically talk his way through an album. His timing, delivery, phrasing and tone put him in an elite class of singers: He’s the Sinatra of his genre.</p>
<p>Since nine of the 11 songs are covers, he didn’t have to do lots of heavy lifting on “First Rose of Spring.”&nbsp;However, the two originals, written with producer Buddy Cannon, are both gentle treasures. “Blue Star,” as delicate as ballads get, will surely bring a tear to couples reaching the end.&nbsp; “When you reach the heaven’s bright, I’ll be the blue star on your right,”&nbsp;Nelson sings.</p>

<p>In the similarly tender “Love Just Laughed,” love personified reacts with laughter, then tears, as romance falls away. “But it was fun in a strange kind of way,” he sings. “We can look back and smile and say / ‘Whatever happened brought us down to the day.’”</p>
<p>We know he can sing a ballad effortlessly —&nbsp;listen to his command on “Yesterday When I Was Young” —&nbsp;but what else can the old cowboy do?</p>
<p>He can vamp through Jimmy Dean’s “Bummin’ Around” and take Johnny Paycheck’s “The Only Hell My Mama Ever Raised” for a ride down the devil’s highway.</p>
<p>Nelson’s also been visible during the pandemic, performing Farm Aid and Willie’s Picnic streams and also turning up on Willie’s Roadhouse Sirius channel with his daughter, Paula, to give callers the thrill of having a brief chat with a legend.</p>
<p><strong>Boss at home</strong></p>
<p>We have no clue what will come from Springsteen’s quarantine, but history shows that he steps up during these occasions.</p>
<p>The Boss has taken a page from “Little Steven’s Underground Garage” and hosted seven sessions of “From My Home to Yours,” spinning music that ranges from Little Richard to Childish Gambino, Martha Reeves to Courtney Barnett.</p>
<p>In Vol. 5, he focused on protest songs and civil rights, playing his own “American Skin (41 Shots),” a song he wrote 20 years ago about the police shooting death of Amadou Diallo that led to cops calling for a boycott of his concerts. With that he mixed music by Bob Marley, Jay Z, Kanye West, Joe Strummer, and Joe Grushecky (they co-wrote “Idiot’s Delight”).</p>
<p>“Now, almost 60 years,” he told listeners, “we wake again to an America with burned-out buildings, torched police cars and shattered shop windows. A cost that we're paying for another half of a century of unresolved, fundamental issues of race. We have not cared for our house very well. There can be no standing peace without the justice owed to every American, regardless of their race, color or creed. The events of this week have once again proven that out.”</p>

<p>In another episode, he chided the president, saying, “With all respect, sir: show some consideration and care for your countrymen and your country. Put on a f---ing mask.” It introduced “The Disease of Conceit,” a song from Dylan, who has been represented in just about every episode.</p>
<p>The most recent ep was the most joyous, as he assembled with Little Steven and Southside Johnny for two hours to revel in the soulful sounds of Asbury Park, N.J., talking about how so much of the inspiration came from seeing a Sam and Dave show.</p>
<p>On a day when COVID cases were rising and all seemed grim, it was a blast to hear the three old friends dancing with the date that brought them.</p>
