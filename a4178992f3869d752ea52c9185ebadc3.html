<h1>Dick's Sporting Goods sales surge as consumers socially distance in the great outdoors</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. posted its highest-ever second-quarter sales as shoppers stocked up on sneakers and athletic apparel during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The key retail metric of same-store sales (sales in stores that have been open at least one year) surged 21% —&nbsp;more than double the estimate of analysts compiled by Consensus Metrix. Sales and profit also beat analysts’s estimates and were the highest ever for a second quarter.</p>
<p>Among the key takeaways from the Findlay-based retailer’s quarterly results:</p>
<p>—&nbsp;CEO Ed Stack said consumers are engaging in more socially distant outdoor activities amid the pandemic. While the outlook remains uncertain, Dick’s is positioned to benefit from increased exercise, he said.</p>
<p>—&nbsp;Sales remain elevated in the current quarter —&nbsp;but not at the same level as the blockbuster second quarter. In the first three weeks of August, same-store sales were up about 11%, the company said.</p>
<p>—&nbsp;The results are another sign of how COVID-19 is creating a divide in the retail world, with grocery stores and big-box chains booming while many specialty and department stores struggle. Heightened demand has created shortages across the U.S. for goods like weights and bikes.</p>
<p>Dick’s shares jumped as much as 15% Wednesday in New York, the biggest intraday gain in more than four months. The shares fell 5.7% this year through Tuesday’s close.</p>
