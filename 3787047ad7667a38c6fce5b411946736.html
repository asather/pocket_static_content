<h1>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Mark Tranquilli suspended without pay</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Mark Tranquilli was suspended without pay Wednesday by the Pennsylvania Court of Judicial Discipline.</p>
<p>The judge was charged two weeks ago with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/08/12/Allegheny-County-judge-Mark-Tranquilli-pittsburgh-judicial-misconduct-racial-slur/stories/202008120129" target="_blank">judicial misconduct</a>&nbsp;following allegations of racist statements and other harassment on the bench.</p>
<p>The Court of Judicial Discipline stated in its filing that the judge’s trial is set to commence on Oct. 5.</p>
<p>Judge John H. Foradora, who also serves in the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas, was the lone dissenter. He argued an interim suspension petition should not be pursued by the court unless criminal charges have been filed, criminal activity had occurred or the judge was previously charged by the Judicial Conduct Board.</p>
<p>“I believe the president judge of each judicial district has the authority to make the appropriate assignment or suspension to protect the integrity of the judiciary in the time between the filing of a complaint by the Judicial Conduct Board and its resolution at trial, the same as the President Judge can between the allegation of wrongdoing and the filing of charges,”&nbsp;” Judge Foradora wrote.</p>
<p>“In this case the most severe sanction has been issued before the trial has occurred.”</p>
<p>According to the state code of judicial salaries, a Common Pleas judge in Allegheny County is paid an annual salary of&nbsp;$186,665.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli’s attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The complaint filed by the Judicial Conduct Board alleges Judge Tranquilli referred to a juror as&nbsp;“Aunt Jemima” during a conversation in his chambers following a trial. He also told the prosecutor in that trial that he knew “darn well” that when the juror “goes home to her baby daddy, he’s probably slinging heroin, too,” the complaint says.</p>
<p>Additionally, he is alleged to have used ebonics during a custody conciliation when speaking to a pair of Black parents about communication, telling them, “And when I say communication, I don’t mean, ‘and den da bitch done dis, and den da bitch done dat,’ ” the complaint reads.</p>
<p>Other allegations include&nbsp;lecturing a woman who pleaded guilty to drug charges about having two children out of wedlock, and telling a defendant he’d be cast “down amongst the [S]odomites” in state prison if the he violated probation.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to his colleagues Tuesday, Judge Tranquilli explained the events that led to the investigation and the subsequent complaint. He described the discussion with the lawyers about the jurors they selected.</p>
<p>“One of the four jurors was a Black female who was seated in the jury&nbsp;box next to a second Black female of similar age,” he wrote in the letter. “When the prosecutor asked which&nbsp;juror I was inquiring about during this discussion, I quickly indicated the one ‘with the&nbsp;Aunt Jemima’ on her head. I focused on an article of clothing that we could all see to&nbsp;distinguish between the two adjacent jurors.”</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli said he could not recall the word&nbsp;“kerchief” or the juror’s number. “While I did not, at any&nbsp;time, refer to the juror as ‘Aunt Jemima,’ a fact corroborated by a polygraph&nbsp;examination I passed during the investigation, the use of that term was nonetheless&nbsp;wrong.”</p>
<p>He called the&nbsp;“baby daddy” comment an “insensitive attempt to make a possible explanation” for a juror’s “perceived hostility” after she appeared to be glaring at a prosecutor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In retrospect, my words were pejorative and offensive — in any context. I should have known better. I should have done better. I am truly sorry I said them and&nbsp;for the harm my words caused.”</p>
<p>Judge Traquilli continued that an analysis of his sentencing statistics shows&nbsp;“justice is meted out fairly and impartially” in his courtroom, and that he sentences Black defendants more leniently than white defendants.</p>
<p>The order Wednesday from the Court of Judicial Discipline states discovery in the judge’s case will be completed by Sept. 15, pretrial memos will be filed by Sept. 18 and a pretrial conference will be held Sept. 21.</p>
<p>The Judicial Conduct Board will act as a prosecutor in the case, with Judge Tranquilli as the defendant.</p>
