<h1>Girls basketball rankings: New No. 1 teams in Class 6A and 3A</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The North Allegheny and Seton LaSalle girls basketball teams were both ranked No. 3 in their respective classifications last week. But both are looking down at everyone else this week.</p>
<p>North Allegheny and Seton LaSalle moved into the No. 1 spot in this week’s Post-Gazette rankings. North Allegheny is No. 1 in Class 6A while Seton LaSalle is at the top in 3A.</p>
<p>North Allegheny had a big win Tuesday against Norwin, which was ranked No. 2 last week. That, coupled with previous No. 1 Bethel Park losing to Mt. Lebanon, moved North Allegheny to the top of the rankings. Mt. Lebanon moved to No. 2 and Bethel Park dropped to third.</p>
<p>North Allegheny is tied for first in Class 6A Section 1 with Norwin. It’s highly likely North Allegheny will win or tie for a section title for the eighth consecutive season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Class 3A, the top two ranked teams from last week lost — Mohawk and Beaver. That allowed Seton LaSalle to move into the top spot. Seton LaSalle is 14-4 this season as the program continues its turnaround from a few years ago. Seton LaSalle didn’t finish above .500 the past three seasons and was 5-16 in 2016-17.</p>
