<h1>WPIAL adds a few playoff qualifiers for basketball</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A few WPIAL basketball sections will get an extra playoff qualifier starting next season.</p>
<p>At a meeting Monday, the WPIAL board of directors approved a slight change to the playoff format for boys and girls basketball. Beginning next season, the WPIAL will have three sections — two girls and one boys — with eight teams. The top five teams from those sections will make the playoffs.</p>
<p>All other sections next season have seven or fewer teams. Those sections will continue to get four playoff qualifiers.</p>
<p>The sections with eight teams next season are in Class 6A girls (Section 1), Class 4A girls (Section 2) and Class 4A boys (Section 2). North Allegheny won the WPIAL 6A girls title out of Section 1.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to get the percentages of playoff teams a little closer for every classification,” WPIAL associate executive director Amy Scheuneman said.</p>
<p>The WPIAL received some criticism the past two years for what some believed was not an equitable playoff format for Class 6A boys and girls. Class 6A girls had 16 teams divided into two eight-team sections. The top four teams in each section qualified for the playoffs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Class 6A boys had 18 teams divided into three six-team sections. The top four teams from each section made the playoffs, which meant the boys had four more postseason qualifiers than the girls.</p>
<p>Next season, Class 6A girls will have 15 teams and nine playoff qualifiers. Class 6A boys will have 17 teams divided into three sections and will have 12 playoff qualifiers.</p>
<p>“We had to have three sections in boys,” Scheuneman said. “Two sections would not give us enough play dates for a nine-team section. We wanted to come up with an equitable way. If we added another qualifier for the girls Class 6A section that has only seven teams, that would be inconsistent with other seven-team sections.”</p>
<p><strong>Let’s play three</strong></p>
<p>The WPIAL also approved a request from one Class 6A boys section to play all section opponents three times.</p>
<p>Section teams usually play each other twice, but Section 1 of Class 6A has only five teams – Butler, North Allegheny, North Hills, Pine-Richland and Seneca Valley. Basketball teams are permitted to play 22 games in the regular season.</p>
<p>“We honored the request because I think those schools realized it will be hard to schedule 14 non-section games,” Scheuneman said.</p>
<p>The WPIAL schedules all section games for all sports. It’s up to each school to schedule non-section games.</p>
<p><strong>Back-to-back in baseball</strong></p>
<p>Section play in WPIAL baseball will be scheduled much differently next year.</p>
<p>The WPIAL has decided to schedule section teams in back-to-back games, and preferably on back-to-back days. The WPIAL made the move after a request from the league’s baseball committee. Usually, a team plays a section opponent once in each half of the season.</p>
<p>“The recommendation from the baseball committee was that this would make more of a team effort,” Scheuneman said. “Teams could throw their No. 1 pitcher the first and second time they played. Now, they might have to use their No. 1 the first day, and maybe their No. 2 the second day against the same team.”</p>
<p>The WPIAL voted against a baseball committee proposal to have three-game series for the semifinals and championships of the playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive cheer change</strong></p>
<p>The WPIAL has made a change to its competitive spirit classifications in order to align with the PIAA.</p>
<p>Competitive spirit will now have two classifications (3A and 2A) for girls teams, with a small squad and large squad division in each class. The small squad division will have teams with one-15 members, and the large squad division will be 16 and up.</p>
<p>The WPIAL will also have a co-ed division, regardless of squad size.</p>
