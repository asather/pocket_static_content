<h1>Derek Holland roughed up in final start before trade deadline</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Derek Holland sat in the visitors’ dugout at Miller Park on Friday, head down, hunched over and a towel slung over his left shoulder, the pitcher contemplating what had just happened.</p>
<p>In a 9-1 loss to the Brewers, Holland had registered eight strikeouts. He also gave up three home runs, moving him into a tie for the MLB lead with 10 on the season. The “softest” of those three carried a 107.3 mph exit velocity, while the Brewers walked four times and scored eight runs off Holland.</p>
<p>The dichotomy of Holland’s start — good at times, plenty hittable during others — was just the latest episode in what should be a wild couple of days for Pirates general manager Ben Cherington, who earlier Friday made a move that signaled his intentions.</p>
<p>By trading Jarrod Dyson to the White Sox for international bonus pool money, Cherington hung a sign outside of PNC Park saying that he was very much open for business — if that wasn’t obvious already given the Pirates’ record, which now stands at 9-20 after they lost for the ninth time in their past 10 trips to Miller Park.</p>
<p>"It’s something that’s going to bother me," Holland said of allowing seven of eight runs with two strikes and two outs. "We were right there. This is what we’ve been working for. We’ve been practicing this the whole time, putting guys away. [Friday] was just one of those days where you got there and all of a sudden you couldn’t finish it."</p>
<p>The Dyson move was interesting because it wasn’t necessarily expected, as the 36-year-old center fielder was lugging around a .157 batting average. It’s applicable here because Holland may offer the Pirates (and other teams) a pitching equivalent.</p>
<p>On one hand, Holland has been solid in spurts — two earned runs over 5 2/3 innings in his Pirates debut, an earned run over 5 more in his last start, the one in Minnesota where he cruised through 5, encountered some trouble, and Miguel Del Pozo imploded.</p>
<p>What is Holland? It’s a good question.</p>
<p>Another team could conceivably see him as a fun-loving veteran who’s comfortable working out of the bullpen for the stretch run, while others might’ve looked at his average exit velocity before Friday’s start — 93.3 mph, worst in MLB among pitchers who’ve faced at least 100 hitters — and had second thoughts.</p>
<p>"For myself, I’m not thinking about being traded," Holland said. "It sounds weird to say, but I mean, who wants a guy with a 15.00 ERA? You can’t be thinking about those things. You’ve got to focus on bettering yourself and making sure you’re doing your job.”</p>
<p>What Holland — who actually has a 7.62 ERA — did against the Brewers provided little clarity. Holland struck out five through the first two innings and allowed just first baseman Jedd Gyorko’s home run in the first. It came on a first-pitch fastball that Holland did not bury far enough inside.</p>
<p>Holland controlled his fastball and was around the plate a lot. Sixty-five of his 100 pitches were strikes, and he threw first-pitch strikes to 19 of the 26 men he faced. He might’ve actually been around the plate a little too much as evidenced by the turning point in this one, which came when right fielder Ryan Braun sat on a full-count sinker and drove it over the left-field fence for a three-run homer.</p>
<p>The location wasn’t terrible — low and inside, for a strike. But it appeared to be predictable, Braun either picking up a tell from Holland or simply guessing that he was leaning heavily on his sinker.</p>
<p>Catcher Jacob Nottingham got another low-and-inside sinker from Holland in the fourth inning and drove it 436 feet for a two-run shot, giving the Brewers a 6-0 lead. Left fielder Mark Mathias’ two-run double in the fifth turned this thing into a laugher.</p>
<p>"We just didn’t finish at-bats," manager Derek Shelton said. "[Holland] did a good job getting to two strikes then left balls in the middle of the plate. They hit ‘em hard and obviously hit some of them out of the ballpark.”</p>
<p>The Pirates did little offensively aside from JT Riddle’s solo homer and Josh Bell picking up a pair of hits. Brewers starter Corbin Burnes shut them down with six shutout innings, striking out 10.</p>
<p>But that hardly mattered when you consider what Holland allowed, which marked the second time in five starts he’s given up eight runs or more. Back on Aug. 8, the Tigers hit five home runs and scored nine earned runs off Holland.</p>
<p>So while Cherington will surely try to shop Holland — and many others — what happened Friday may have made that a little harder to do.</p>
<p>"I’m not going to focus on that," Holland said. "We lose a nice piece in Dyson, that’s something we’re definitely going to miss. At the same time, we can’t worry about those things. If you start doing that, then that’s when the distraction starts becoming something else instead of doing what you should be doing on the field."</p>
