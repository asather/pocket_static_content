<h1>How can pitchers avoid 'spike' in Tommy John surgeries when baseball returns?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ron Wolforth has written five books on pitching, while his Texas Baseball Ranch has gained notoriety for blending technology with a non-traditional approach to increase pitchers’ velocity and performance. Since 2003, 64 Wolforth clients have been drafted.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Ahmad is an orthopedic surgeon at the New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. He teaches at Columbia University, serves as the head team physician for the Yankees and has been performing Tommy John surgery for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Together, they share the same concern.</p>
<p>With baseball expected to ramp back up soon, and for over-exuberant, no-longer-quarantined pitchers to try and achieve top speed as quickly as possible, there will likely be an increased risk of arm injuries, specially ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) issues that ultimately result in Tommy John surgery.</p>
<p>"The coronavirus pandemic may very well indirectly cause a spike in Tommy John surgery because of intense enthusiasm, lack of ideal conditioning, poor mechanics, faster than usual ramp up and avoidance of symptom communication," Ahmad wrote on Medium earlier this month. "Everyone who is involved in baseball and is willing to recognize this threat can improve these modifiable risks and help their players avoid Tommy John surgery."</p>
<p>How major league pitchers, who are routinely among the most well-compensated players on the field, can avoid serious arm injuries could literally be a million-dollar question, one Wolforth and others have spent a lifetime preparing to answer.</p>
<p>The process of ramping back up safely is one that includes several layers, starting with how pitchers are training now, extending through what will become spring training 2.0 and ultimately the 2020 season.</p>
<p>In some cases, it might not be a huge thing. Like if a pitcher had access to a workout facility with a catcher and was able to occasionally throw to live hitters, great. But others haven’t been so lucky.</p>
<p>How that plays out should be fascinating, said Dr. Rand McClain, who runs his own sports medicine practice (Regenerative &amp; Sports Medicine) in Santa Monica, Calif.</p>
<p>“It may end up teaching us something good or bad,” McClain said. “We’ve been channeled into this idea that the only place to work out is on the field or in the gym, in groups.</p>
<p>“Not to sound like an old geezer, but in my generation, they were just building gyms. You learned your sport and got your fitness outside the gym.&nbsp;The options are there. It’s more about the execution.”</p>
<p>Allegheny Health Network director of sports performance Frank Velasquez would likely agree. Velasquez was the Pirates’ strength and conditioning coach from 2003-12 and knows plenty about baseball-specific training.</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Velasquez has been working out of AHN’s two sports performance centers, in Wexford and Bethel Park, helping to train some major leaguers from Pittsburgh on other teams.</p>
<p>But regardless of whether the player is a pro or a high schooler, a good starting point for Velasquez involves routine.</p>
<p>“Something Monday through Friday that keeps you regimented,” Velasquez said. “You’re getting up. You’re going to do this or that. You’re going to have lunch. You might take a nap. You have family time. We don’t want ’em just floating away like a ship at sea.”</p>
<p>On the pro side, the implementation of a routine is less about doing something — these guys know they need to work — and more about what it is that you do, how pitchers’ arms respond to those specific demands.</p>
<p>At the Texas Baseball Ranch, Wolforth focuses a lot on soft tissue, trying to keep it “robust and resilient,” which he said can be achieved in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Wolforth often has his pitchers throw weighted balls or use wrist weights. There’s even a contraption that looks like a cross between a bowling pin and a grenade called the Connector Throwing Club that he has pitchers chuck into a net or screen.</p>
<p>“Preparing your soft tissue for competition is really a physiological thing,” Wolforth said. “Soft tissue needs to have a time for adaptation to prepare for these stresses.”</p>
<p>If there’s limited space, no worry. One way to ramp back up is to throw harder and harder into a screen or net or even into a sock that’s tied around the wrist. (Fancier versions can be purchased online.)</p>
<p>“Although it’s not perfect, the soft tissue of the shoulder and elbow doesn’t know if it’s throwing at 15 feet or 300 feet,” Wolforth said.</p>
<p>Crafting a weekly routine, the same as in-season outings, should be done carefully, Wolforth said. Two days should be heavy, where pitchers “push the envelope.” Three should include medium work, and two should be light, where you basically warm up, do something quickly, and you’re done.</p>
<p>“That allows the soft tissue to actually adapt to the stress you put on it,” Wolforth said.</p>
<p>Ahmad stressed honesty in his Medium post, which was geared toward all levels. Anyone experiencing arm pain should say something. Parents should watch for over-icing, habitual massaging of the elbow or NSAID abuse — signs of potential soreness.</p>
<p>Often, Ahmad added, pain in other parts of the body could also indicate overuse and a future UCL issue.</p>
<p>“Going fast with a return to baseball is like tailgating the car in front of you at high speed,” Ahmad wrote. “You simply don’t have time to respond when driving 76 mph with two feet separating you and the car ahead. A high-speed crash can ruin your career. This is especially true in bad conditions such as night time, rain, winding slippery roads, etc. If we slow down, we dramatically improve safety. When conditions allow, we speed up and avoid injury.”</p>
<p>Velasquez has been emphasizing not just physical fitness — or proper sleep, nutrition and hydration — but sport-specific movements. For example, instead of having his players run for time or distance, he’ll have them complete base running circuits.</p>
<p>“I don’t want the first time for those guys to run the bases to be at spring training,” Velasquez. “That just increases the risk of an injury.”</p>
<p>Velasquez has also become a part-time psychologist, talking down some of his pitchers when their bullpens aren’t as sharp as they’d like them to be.</p>
<p>“I don’t expect ’em to dot a gnat’s ass right now, and they shouldn’t either,” Velasquez said. “They’ll get a few weeks with their own coaches and a more intense regimen, where they can hone in.</p>
<p>“But with there still being a question mark on when they’re going back, I tell them, ‘Don’t use all your bullets now. I don’t want you to report to camp with shoulder tightness.’ ”</p>
