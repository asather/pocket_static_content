<h1>Pirates add reliever Jandel Gustave after Henderson Alvarez deal falls through</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Henderson Alvarez won’t become a Pittsburgh Pirate after all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jandel Gustave is the latest pitcher the Pirates are hoping to add to help their pitching depth.</p>
<p>Alvarez, who threw a no-hitter in 2013 and was an All-Star with the Marlins in 2014, tweeted late Sunday night that his deal with the Pirates fell through.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">It stops what could have potentially been a really neat story, the 30-year-old right-hander working his way back from the ground up, and the reasons why it happened differ.</span></p>
<p>Alvarez said it was because the Pirates signed another player. The Pirates dispute that, with one front-office source saying the two pitchers had nothing to do with one another. The source emphasized&nbsp;that the Pirates would never agree to terms with a player contingent on a deal with a different player.</p>
<p>The Pirates reached a tentative agreement with Alvarez on Aug. 9, plucking him from the Milwaukee Milkmen of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball.</p>
<p>Gustave, who has pitched for the Astros (2016-17) and Giants (2019), offers an interesting consolation prize. The 6-foot-3, 220-pound right-hander has a 3.43 career ERA in 43 appearances, including a 2.96 ERA in 23 appearances last season.</p>
<p>The Dominican-born righty has a fairly good career strikeout rate (17.4%) but has also struggled with his control (10.9% walk rate).</p>
<p>San Francisco designated Gustave for assignment on Aug. 2. He has three pitches that he uses a decent amount: a four-seamer, slider and sinker. The four-seamer and sinker both averaged 96.1 mph in 2019, while opponents hit just .167 off Gustave's slider.</p>
<p>It’s likely that Gustave will report to the Pirates’ alternate-site camp in Altoona. Milwaukee-based freelancer Robert Murray first reported the Gustave agreement.</p>
