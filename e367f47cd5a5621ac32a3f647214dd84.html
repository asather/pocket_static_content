<h1>New study at Pitt is aimed at keeping COVID-19 patients out of the hospital</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced on Wednesday that it is operating one of the 25 initial nationwide sites that will test therapies aimed at treating early-stage COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>As part of the National Institute of Health’s Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) initiative, which aims to speed up the development of the most promising COVID-19 treatments and vaccines, the new study at Pitt will attempt to find treatments that will prevent hospitalization and lessen the severity of the virus in people who are recovering from home.</p>
<p>“This study aims to develop a treatment that can prevent people with COVID-19 from progressing to advanced disease that requires hospitalization,” said Dr. Madhu Choudhary, associate professor in Pitt’s division of infectious diseases and principal investigator for the Pittsburgh trial site.</p>
<p>“While people with COVID-19 may start off with just a few minor symptoms, they can rapidly become very ill, and this is true of both the old and young,” she said in a news release</p>

<p>The study, which is referred to as ACTIV-2, is funded through the federal Operation Warp Speed and will include phase 2 and phase 3 clinical evaluations of multiple promising treatments.</p>
<p>Pitt officials said that ACTIV-2 is being conducted by the AIDS Clinical Trial Group, which is the world’s largest and oldest HIV clinical trials network and of which Pitt has been a member since 1998, because of its “extensive experience with clinical trials.”</p>
<p>ACTIV-2 is a “randomized, blinded, controlled adaptive platform,” which means that promising treatments can be added or removed from the study depending on their performance.</p>
<p>The first drug being studied in the trial is an intravenously given, monoclonal antibody treatment made by Eli Lilly and Company, according to officials.</p>
<p>In the phase 2 portion of the study, which is currently underway, 110 participants will be chosen nationwide to receive a monoclonal antibody infusion. Those participants will be compared to a separate group of 110 who will receive a placebo. The treatment will then move to phase 3 if it produces positive results without any notable safety concerns.</p>
<p>In phase 3, researchers will evaluate the ability of each treatment to prevent hospitalization and death in adults who are COVID-19 positive; 1,000 people will get the treatment, and 1,000 will get the placebo.</p>
<p>To qualify for the study, a participant must have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus that causes COVID-19, as an outpatient and started experiencing symptoms within 10 days of applying for the study, officials said.</p>
<p>Officials also said that researchers are particularly interested in applicants who are SARS-CoV-2 positive and are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, such as those who are 55 and older who have chronic lung, kidney or liver disease; obesity; hypertension; cardiovascular disease; diabetes; or moderate to severe asthma.</p>
<p>“People living in the Pittsburgh area who have recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are not hospitalized have the opportunity to make a huge contribution by participating in this study,” Dr. Choudhary said.</p>
