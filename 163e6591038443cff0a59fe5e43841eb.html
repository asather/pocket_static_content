<h1>Pa. voting issues resting primarily in the courts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As nearly 2.5 million Pennsylvanians make their way through the state’s vote by mail system ahead of this November’s election, state officials are fighting in court to provide clarity to key aspects of the process — hoping that litigation is settled quickly so voters can have confidence in casting their ballots.</p>
<p>The state filed briefs in three separate courts this week — two of which pertain to specific cases — to urge judgments in matters that could impact where voters drop their ballots off, how long they have to return their ballots to county elections offices and how those counties tally them.</p>
<p>As it stands now, the state Supreme Court’s ruling in September is the guidance that voters should follow. The court ruled that counties in Pennsylvania are allowed to count mail-in ballots that are received in the three days following the Nov. 3 election — as long as they were postmarked by 8 p.m. on Election Day. It also permitted counties to collect hand-delivered ballots at drop boxes and satellite offices.</p>
<p>“We have high confidence...that [the state Supreme Court ruling] is going to be the final answer on most things,” Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said Wednesday in a call with reporters, “but of course, we’d rather all the remaining issues be decided as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>One of those pending matters is a request by Pennsylvania Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, R-Jefferson, and Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the three-day extension for counting mail ballots — arguing that the state Supreme Court’s ruling superseded the Legislature’s rightful authority.</p>
<p>The state filed a brief in opposition to the Senate Republicans’ request this week, saying that the state Supreme Court’s decision was&nbsp;“manifestly correct” and urging the court — regardless of its decision on the stay request — to help provide&nbsp;“clarity and certainty” for Pennsylvanians regarding the deadline.</p>
<p>If the stay is denied, counties certifiably will have the three extra days to count ballots that come in by mail — permitted by the state Supreme Court, Justice Max Baer wrote, because voters can’t exercise their right to vote if United States Postal Service delays are the reason their ballots are in a postal facility as the deadline passes.</p>
<p>Another pending case is in federal court in Pittsburgh, where President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, the Republican National Committee and local GOP congressmen are seeking specific limitations to the use of drop boxes and whether some votes can be tossed out as illegitimate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GOP stakeholders originally had wanted the court to rule the entire concept of drop boxes to be unlawful, but after the state Supreme Court ruling, they shifted to move that the use of drop boxes is inconsistent and that unstaffed and unmonitored boxes create “a severe risk of illegal ballot casting, through unlawful third-party ballot harvesting and fraudulent votes.” They’re asking the court to demand that all drop boxes and mobile collection sites be staffed, secured and “employed consistently” across all 67 counties.</p>
<p>Ms. Boockvar’s lawyers countered that counties have control over their election procedures, and said the idea that unmanned drop boxes will lead to voter fraud “remains unsupported.”</p>
<p>Saying there is no indication that November’s election will be&nbsp;“anything but free and fair” and that counties are applying election law&nbsp;“in a manner that promotes voter inclusivity and enfranchisement,” the state asked that the Trump campaign’s remaining claims be dismissed.</p>
<p>“While the Secretary hoped that&nbsp;would put an end to this sprawling federal action, [the Trump campaign and RNC] have persisted, and have in fact&nbsp;amended their Complaint to challenge still more election issues, with the apparent goal of&nbsp;disenfranchising more voters, and have demanded still more discovery from the Department of&nbsp;State and others, taking significant time away from election preparations,” lawyers for Ms. Boockvar wrote, insisting that&nbsp;“the time has come for citizens, not lawyers, to be heard.”</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan ordered Tuesday that he will make a decision without further hearings, signaling a potentially imminent decision.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the state went ahead and asked the state Supreme Court this week to rule on the issue — also at the center of the Trump campaign’s federal suit —&nbsp;of signature verification, warning that thousands of Pennsylvania voters would be disenfranchised if&nbsp;“arbitrary signature comparisons and challenges to signature variations are allowed to be used as a basis for rejecting mail and absentee ballots.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign is asking the court to issue an injunction requiring county boards of elections to verify the identification of registered voters who cast ballots by comparing their ballot signature to the information on their registration card. Boards are required to set ballots aside that contain signatures that do not match the ones in their voter registration records, they claim.</p>
<p>Ms. Boockvar and state officials are asking the court to declare that counties may not reject applications or refuse to count voted ballots because of a&nbsp;“subjective perception of signature variation,” and that ballots or applications may not be challenged by third parties because of signature comparison.</p>
<p>“Lack of a definitive ruling from this Court on the proper interpretation&nbsp;of the Election Code will lead to dissension and disputes when ballots are pre-canvassed beginning on November 3, 2020,” lawyers for the state wrote to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, nearly 9 million Pennsylvanians were registered to vote — including 4.2 million Democrats and 3.5 million Republicans. Close to 2.5 million mail-in and absentee ballot applications have been approved, Ms. Boockvar said, and ballots have been sent — or are in the process of being sent —&nbsp;to 96% of those voters so far.</p>
<p>About 92,700 voted ballots have been returned, Ms. Boockvar added.</p>
