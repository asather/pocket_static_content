<p>The Pittsburgh Irish Festival, which has been running streaming concerts during the pandemic, will postpone this year’s live event until 2021.</p>
<p>The festival said in a news release that “the safety of the staff, volunteers, patrons, vendors, and entertainers is of utmost concern and based on information gathered, [the board of directors] feel this is the best decision.”</p>
<p>Those who have purchased advanced tickets online for the September event will be contacted directly with options to receive a full refund,&nbsp;transfer their ticket to the 2021 cestival, or donate the ticket cost to the Pittsburgh Irish Festival.</p>
<p>Anyone who&nbsp;received a complimentary ticket or voucher as part of a promotion may use these in 2021.</p>
<p>“We are grateful for our community’s understanding and commitment to our mission of preserving and promoting the Irish culture in our area. While this decision was incredibly difficult, we know that the Pittsburgh Irish Festival and other&nbsp;live events will bounce back stronger than ever,” Mairin Petrone, the festival’s executive director, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The 2021 dates will be Sept. 10-12. In the meantime, the Irish Festival plans to expand its streaming performances on its Facebook page.</p>
