<h1>Paul Zeise: Pitt needs to find a way out of this current tailspin</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pitt basketball team was 13-4 at one point in the season and dreaming of flirting with an NCAA tournament bid. The Panthers are 2-10 since. They have now lost five in a row and there is no reason to believe they won’t extend that to seven games with two road games on the horizon.</p>
<p>That would be a disaster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, it shouldn’t call into question Jeff Capel as a coach, as this is still a season with no expectations. He did inherit, as he so eloquently said, a dumpster fire and there was a lot of work to do just to get from awful to bad. The team lacks depth, there isn’t a single player who can shoot competently from the 3-point line, there isn’t a legitimate point guard and the post presence is lacking.</p>
<p>That being said, there is no excuse for this collapse. Yes, they have won twice as many ACC games as they did last year, but that is a very low bar to clear considering they only won three. They did play more competitively against Duke than they had against some of the top teams the last few years. There were some encouraging signs that things are headed in the right direction.</p>
<p>But if the Panthers can’t figure out how to turn this around and win a game or two before they pack it in for the year, I am not sure how anyone could suggest that there has been any significant progress made. I keep hearing&nbsp;“this team is young,” but the team’s two stars have now started 60-plus games.</p>
<p>The Panthers beat Rutgers, Florida State, Georgia Tech and Miami — they have proven that despite their shortcomings, they have enough talent to beat middling teams. In the case of Florida State, they proved that they can beat a really good team.</p>
<p>I am not saying the Panthers should have 10 ACC wins now, but watching them play the other night against a mediocre Syracuse team was disheartening. They were never in the game.</p>
<p>This is supposed to be a young, hungry team with a chip on its shoulder that plays with an edge. That’s who they were in the early part of the season, anyway. That’s how they took the court for most of the first 18 games or so. This was a team that was committed to defending, shared the ball, played like a team and played like they were out to prove people wrong.</p>
<p>What happened to that team? Where did that team go? And how in the world could they have disappeared down the stretch? It makes no sense to me that a team with so many young players is already disinterested.&nbsp; And it is even more disheartening when you consider this is a year Pitt could have — <em>should</em> have — made up ground because the ACC is down a little bit.</p>
<p>And how in the world can Division I players shoot so poorly and not do a thing about it? Their best shooter is Ryan Murphy and he shoots 33 percent from the 3-point line. The best shooters in the NCAA shoot about 48 percent from the 3-point line, for perspective. It isn’t hard, either, but it requires a lot of extra work on the shot.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to hammer the Panthers. It is a process and it will take time, but they can’t just lay down and die. And Capel, while he isn’t a miracle worker, needs to figure out how to get that ultra-hungry, aggressive team he had early in the season back out on the court for the final few games.</p>
<p>Pitt plays bubble NC State team and then Georgia Tech, which isn’t very good. The Panthers will then play someone in the back third of the ACC in their first ACC tournament game. That’s not exactly a gauntlet of unbeatable teams. Pitt needs to win at least once and be competitive in all three games.</p>
<p>Capel has done a good job of building a foundation, but he has to show he can stop this free fall. It is a young team that is learning how to compete and win and they also need to learn how to get themselves out of a slump. This is a free fall right now and it is up to Capel — and his players — to make sure it doesn’t turn into an all-out, season-ending collapse.&nbsp;</p>
