<h1>Standoff at Arrowhead Stadium could affect Pirates' game in Kansas City</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>KANSAS CITY — The Pirates could have their game Saturday against the Royals — or at least the time before it — affected by a standoff between police and an armed shooter that occurred earlier outside nearby Arrowhead Stadium.</p>
<p>Police were called to the Truman Sports Complex after receiving reports of a man shooting at stadium employees. Nobody was injured, and negotiators are talking with the man, hoping to bring the incident to a peaceful conclusion.</p>
<p>However, with the situation unfolding next door to Kauffman Stadium — and now confined to the southeast parking lot area — the Pirates are unable to enter the complex and get to the ballpark, as all entrances and parking lots are closed.</p>
<p>Pregame Zoom calls with reporters have been delayed, because they occur at the stadium. It also stands to reason that the Pirates’ pregame work will be affected, although sources indicated they were still hopeful that the game will be played.</p>
<p>If they would have to postpone, the Pirates and Royals would likely play two seven-inning games Sunday.</p>
