<h1>Pittsburghers mourn the loss of music legend John Prine</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In one of his most humorous songs, John Prine rattles off a litany of hilarious reader complaints to advice columnist Abigail Van Buren.</p>
<p>One guy says his feet are too long, another has a stomach that makes noises when he kisses, another laments, “every side I get up on is the wrong side of bed.”</p>
<p>The answer to all of them in “Dear Abby” is “You have no complaint/you are what you are and you ain’t what you ain’t.”</p>
<p>That plain-spoken humility seemed to run through the songs of the folk/country legend who beat cancer but <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2020/04/07/Grammy-winning-singer-songwriter-John-Prine-dies-at-73-from-COVID-19/stories/202004070160" target="_blank">succumbed to COVID-19 Tuesday at 73</a>.</p>
<p>Bonnie Raitt, whose cover of Prine’s “Angel From Montgomery” is a classic in its own right, told Rolling Stone in 2016, “He was incredibly endearing and witty. The combination of being that tender and that wise and that astute, mixed with his homespun sense of humor — it was probably the closest thing for those of us that didn’t get the blessing of seeing Mark Twain in person.”</p>
<p>Born in a Chicago suburb, the son of a union steelworkers president, Prine was weaned on the classic country of Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers, and went on to compose many of his own songs while walking his route as a postman. He was drafted into the Army in 1966, at the outset of the Vietnam War, and had the good fortune of being sent to Stuttgart, West Germany, where he described his service as “drinking beer and pretending to fix trucks.”</p>
<p>He returned to shake up the Chicago folk scene, where none other than Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert stumbled upon one of his sets and penned a review with the headline “Singing Mailman Delivers a Powerful Message in a Few Words.”</p>
<p>Soon after that, Prine was “discovered” by Kris Kristofferson who would note that he was so good “we'll have to break his thumbs.”</p>
<p>Prine’s self-titled 1971 debut album — filled to the brim with future classics like the devastating veteran’s tale “Sam Stone,” the tender "Angel from Montgomery," “Paradise” and “Hello in There” — put him in the ranks of “the new Dylans,” both a blessing and a curse.</p>
<p>Bruce Springsteen, who met Prine at, of all places, backstage at a Dylan show in the ‘70s, tweeted Tuesday night, “Over here on E Street, we are crushed by the loss of John Prine. John and I were ‘New Dylans’ together in the early 70s and he was never anything but the loveliest guy in the world. A true national treasure and a songwriter for the ages. We send our love and prayers to his family.”</p>
<p>We never got much Prine in Pittsburgh in those early days. In May 1986, in one of my first reviews for the Post-Gazette, I wrote of a John Prine/Arlo Guthrie bill at the Syria Mosque, “Prine’s presence was cause for excitement, because in 15 years of performing, he had managed to avoid Pittsburgh, a city that seems like a John Prine type of town.”</p>
<p>He made a return trip, to Graffiti in 1991, and in more recent years he performed at Hartwood Acres in 2003 (a few years after recovering from a squamous cell cancer in his neck) and at the Benedum in 2014 (soon after having cancer removed in his left lung) and at Heinz Hall in 2018.</p>
<p>Prine leaves behind wife/manager Fiona and their three sons, 18 studio albums and the undying respect of his fans, musical peers and a younger generation of musicians who were inspired by his down-to-earth yet elegant style to write their own songs.</p>
<p>Here is what Pittsburghers are saying about him on social media:</p>
<p><strong>Andre Costello (Andre Costello and the Cool Minors):</strong></p>
<p>“Thought you were gonna make it. I’ll never forget listening to ‘Paradise’ as a younger man, driving through Kentucky, headed to Memphis, late at night, summer, car full of friends and my future wife asleep in the back. Rest In Peace. You painted pictures of the American soul.”</p>
<p><strong>Paul Tabachneck (singer-songwriter):</strong></p>
<p>“John Prine was a name I didn't know until I'd heard Nanci Griffith cover ‘Speed of the Sound of Loneliness,’ after which I noticed that that cover of ‘Hello In There’ by Natalie Merchant, Michael Stipe, and Billy Bragg was a Prine song. Dude wrote real-ass songs, that felt universal, that glued themselves to the singer.”</p>
<p><strong>Mark Dignam (Irish singer-songwriter):</strong></p>
<p>“My buddy Glen [Hansard] called me up one night, and told me to meet him at The Dockers (famous/infamous bar in Dublin). It was good Friday, and I protested, that there wasn't a bar open in the whole country. Glen just told me to meet him there, and bring my guitar with me. I said sure, and soon we were both standing outside the bar, sheepishly tapping on the securely locked door. Amazingly it opened, and we were ushered in.</p>
<p>In the almost empty room was a gentleman I knew already, Satch Wright, an American guitar player who looked and sounded like a real deal cowboy. He was a great towering man, and a wonderful musician. At first I didn't realize who the only other guy in the room was. He held an acoustic guitar on his lap, and nodded to the two young whippersnappers that just came in. It's only when I sat beside him and started taking out my guitar did I realize it was John Prine.</p>
<p>I wish I had then, the songs I have now. My material was overwrought, and clumsy, while he just played these, on-the-surface, simple songs, that were infused with a quiet depth. He was doing in one verse what I was desperately trying to do in an hour’s worth of songs: telling very real stories about real life. Shooting arrows that were all hitting the bullseye. In some ways I regret being in that room that night... I didn't deserve it... same with my brief tour with Billy Bragg... I wasn't ready, and I really wish I could have another go.</p>
<p>It seems I won't get that chance again with Prine... the virus took him after all.</p>
<p>I'll just have to sit with the songs, and learn from those masterpieces.</p>
<p>RIP John Prine.”</p>
<p><strong>Brad Wagner (singer-songwriter):</strong></p>
<p>“Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.”</p>
<p>...when you can write lines like that, you will live forever ...Thank You John Prine</p>
<p><strong>Rich Engler (promoter):</strong></p>
<p>“He was a unique artist with not only a bluegrass and country feel but humor in his music. He came out around the same time as Ry Cooder, Randy Newman, a whole handful of artists that were kind of folky. Like Johnny Cash, as he got older, he became a legend.”</p>
<p><strong>Shawn McGregor (The Commonheart):</strong></p>
<p>“Hard pressed to find a songwriter who captured the American experience better than John Prine. Lyrics that can bring you to your knees. What a loss.”</p>
<p><strong>Brooke Duer (Stick Against Stone, The Core):</strong></p>
<p>“When I was probably age 13, I placed my little cassette recorder next to the TV's speaker because WQED was broadcasting a show of musical performances from the Philly Folk Festival. A really drunk guy played a song that I never recovered from. This was it. I was hooked for life. I think I might still have the cassette. R.I.P. John Prime. Such a giant.”</p>
<p><strong>Tony Norman (Post-Gazette columnist):</strong></p>
<p>“I was beginning to believe John Prine would pull a Houdini and beat this. I even imagined an eventual tour where he would do a song or two about the coronavirus and how he beat it. There would even be a fanciful tale about going to heaven and being refused entry, resulting in an awkward return to Earth and a consequent tour to "make amends." I really thought he was going to pull through. He didn't, and now, one of the great ones is gone.”</p>
<p><strong>Norman Nardini (Pittsburgh rock legend):</strong></p>
<p>RIP John Prine..you were, and are, an American treasure..</p>
<p><strong>Amy Rigby (indie-rocker):</strong></p>
<p>“I feel proud to be a songwriter tonight. I feel devastated tonight. RIP John Prine, you showed how it’s done and for all the right reasons - you are with us forever.”</p>
