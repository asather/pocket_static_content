<h1>Sympathy, calm and political wrangling: Trump's positive COVID-19 test breeds new uncertainty in Washington and 2020 campaign</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — News that President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19 swirled through the nation’s capital on Friday, bringing with it widespread political uncertainty and further upending an already unpredictable campaign season about a month before Election Day.</p>
<p>Lawmakers of both parties issued brief messages of&nbsp;sympathy and calm that registered the gravity of the 74-year-old president falling ill with a virus known to inflict of a range of symptoms and has&nbsp;killed at least 200,000 Americans.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>But while Mr. Trump vowed to continue exercising the duties of president and campaigning for reelection, there emerged an inescapable political calculation&nbsp;amid speculation at what comes next, according to experts on campaigns and presidential power.</p>
<p>“It’s a very delicate balance for both sides,” said Gerald Shuster, a faculty expert in presidential rhetoric and political communication at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Democrats, following the lead of former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign, will try to maintain their criticism of the president’s handling of the pandemic while&nbsp;avoiding any messaging that even resembles a “cheer,” Mr. Shuster said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Republicans likely will have to acknowledge, likely in subtle ways, the ever-present dangers of a virus they had hoped would take a back seat to the economic benefits brought by reopened businesses, schools and sporting events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any appeal to voters’ sympathy for Mr. Trump&nbsp;“is not going to be easy to do, especially for somebody who maintained he didn’t need to follow those rules and never required his followers to do the same,” Mr. Shuster said.</p>
<p>So long as his symptoms are mild, Mr. Trump will still be able to govern using the same kind of work-from-home platforms — though much more advanced and secure — that much of the country has experienced, said John Hudak, deputy director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>In July, Mr. Hudak authored a Brookings post entitled: “What happens if President Trump contracts COVID-19.” The post outlined the process laid out in the U.S. Constitution by which a vice president can temporarily assume presidential powers in the event of health issues.</p>
<p>In an interview Friday, Mr. Hudak pointed to instances where presidents invoke the 25th Amendment to voluntarily hand over power — such as during a surgery that requires anesthesia or heavy sedation.</p>
<p>A second section of the law allows the vice president, along with a majority of the Cabinet, to declare a president incapacitated and temporarily pass powers to the vice president.</p>
<p>That section could be invoked if Mr. Trump were placed on a ventilator, which involves minimal to deep sedation and affects a patient’s cognitive and speaking abilities, Mr. Hudak said.</p>
<p>If Mr. Trump will be forced to pull back on his in-person rallies, that could ultimately play in the president’s favor,&nbsp;said Justin DePlato, associate professor of political science of Robert Morris University.</p>
<p>“People might feel sympathy for the president and give him a second chance, second thought.” Mr. DePlato said.&nbsp;“While being off the campaign trail would appear bad for Trump, maybe a less visible Trump is better for Trump.”</p>
<p>Other experts believed Mr. Trump’s illness&nbsp;was a moment of reckoning for people who denied the dangers of the virus.</p>
<p>While Mr. Trump’s positive test raised “parallels to prior presidential health scares, perhaps a better analogy is to President Johnson and the credibility gap over administration statements about Vietnam,”&nbsp;said Doug Kriner, Cornell University professor of government and an expert on presidential power.</p>
<p>“President Trump has repeatedly declared that victory against the virus is right around the corner — or even achieved,” Mr. Kriner said.&nbsp;“The president’s own positive test has demolished it in a way consistent statistics could not.”</p>
<p>As Pennsylvania's congressional delegation woke up to the news Friday, members of both parties sent well wishes to the president and his wife.</p>
<p>Democrats, who have accused the president of downplaying of the pandemic, showed the restraint described by Mr. Shuster, the Pitt political rhetoric expert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am very concerned by President Trump’s announcement that he and the First Lady have tested positive for COVID-19,” Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, said in a statement. “I wish them both a speedy and complete recovery.”</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa. — who has consistently criticized the president’s handling of the distribution of personal protective equipment and testing supplies and nursing home oversight — said he “will keep them in my prayers.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey also likely contracted COVID-19 in late March, he announced in May after receiving blood test results that showed “substantial levels” of COVID-19 antibodies, which are proteins that serve as indicators that the body successfully fended off the virus. Mr. Casey had felt mild flu-like symptoms and isolated himself in his home in Scranton until he recovered, he said in a May interview.</p>
<p>Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, a key surrogate for Mr. Biden in Western Pennsylvania, responded that he was&nbsp;“praying for the president and first lady to have a speedy recovery.”</p>
<p>Republicans who have encouraged public health measures more seriously than Mr. Trump also avoided taking direct aim at the president.</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., spearheaded a national awareness campaign, along with Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/04/01/As-masks-become-scarce-a-delicate-recommendation-for/stories/202004010091?cid=search" target="_blank">encourage Americans to wear masks</a> as a way to protect themselves and others from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey successfully pressed officials with the&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reverse its initial guidance that stated masks had no effect in preventing the spread of the virus. The CDC recommended masks in April.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, Mr. Toomey said he was “sending along best wishes to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on a full and speedy recovery.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson added that Mr.&nbsp;Toomey “feels fine” and has not has not held any recent in-person meetings with White House staff. Vice President Mike Pence, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone accompanied Judge Amy Barrett, Mr. Trump’s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, to meet with top Senate Republicans on Sept. 29.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As of now, Senator Toomey does not anticipate having to quarantine,” the spokesperson, Steve Kelly, said in an email, confirming Mr. Toomey was not present at those meetings.</p>
<p>Rep. John Joyce, R-Blair, rode on Air Force One and “met briefly” with Mr. Trump on Sept. 26, during the president’s trip to Harrisburg. A spokesperson said Dr. Joyce had consulted with the Office of the Attending Physician at the U.S. Capitol and decided not to quarantine.</p>
<p>“He will continue to follow CDC guidelines of wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing,” said Emma Thomson, a spokesperson for Dr. Joyce.</p>
<p>Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters, was not at that Harrisburg event, a spokesperson said, and sent “thoughts and prayers” to the president and first lady.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, who contracted COVID-19 in March and endured painful symptoms, took to Twitter to “call on all western Pennsylvanians to join me in prayer for&nbsp;@realDonaldTrump&nbsp;and&nbsp;@FLOTUS&nbsp;as they battle COVID-19.”</p>
<p>“They are tough and will bounce back stronger than ever!” Mr. Kelly wrote.</p>
