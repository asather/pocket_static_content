<h1>Fishing Report: Muskie caught during mother-son fishing trip in Beaver County</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A muskellunge estimated to measure 36 to 40 inches was brought to shore at the New Brighton Dam on the Beaver River last week. Caught by Tara Toth of Fallstone, Beaver County, while fishing with her son Jesse Toth, the muskie went for a 3-inch soft plastic Fat Albert Chartreuse Pepper Swim Bait.</p>
<p>After a few quick pictures, the big fish was released.</p>
<p>In Erie County, steelhead smolts are being “planted” in tributaries this week through the end of March. The state Fish and Boat Commission cautioned anglers to avoid accidentally stepping on the 6- to 8-inch fish in shallow water.</p>
<p>Smolts are young rainbow trout. They will imprint on their home waters, enter the lake and return in three years as powerful steelhead attempting to spawn. Native to the Pacific Northwest, rainbows and steelhead were brought to the Great Lakes to create the recreational fishery. In a program funded by anglers, Pennsylvania plants 1 million steelhead smolts each year..</p>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County) Crappies were boated in the shallows of Misery Bay. Yellow perch were taken from boats and shore on Presque Isle Bay. Despite low clear water through most of the week, steelhead in the 25-inch range took egg sacs and were released on Elk Creek above Foley’s End. Other anglers had hookups on small flies. Wednesday night rains left the streams high and cloudy. More rain was expected Friday with partly cloudy skies through the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Clarion County) Walleye were caught between Emlenton and Parker.</p>
<p><strong>Clarion River</strong> (Clarion County) Good-size muskellunge and walleye were caught near the Allegheny River.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio River</strong> (Beaver County) Shore anglers hooked up with small muskies.</p>
<p><strong>North Park Lake</strong> (Allegheny County) As part of an accelerated trout stocking schedule designed to reduce COVID-19 contact among workers and anglers, the lake was given its full year’s supply of trout last week. Under Stocked Trout Open for Year-Round Fishing regulations, trout may be caught and immediately released but not “taken, killed or possessed” through April 17.</p>
<p><strong>Twin Lakes</strong> (Westmoreland County) Located in a region likely to be impacted by COVID-19, the Greensburg-area lakes were expected to get all of its trout in one consolidated stocking. Both lakes are enrolled in the Stocked Trout Open for Year-Round Fishing program.</p>
<p><strong>Quemahoning Reservoir</strong> (Somerset County) Northern pike were taken, including a 30-inch, 7 1/2-pounder that was caught on smelt and released.</p>
<p><strong>Laurel Hill Creek</strong> (Somerset County) Good-size trout were caught and released on both Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only stretches, which were stocked March 14. Trophy-size trout were stocked in the upper DHALO, part of the Keystone Select Stocked Trout Waters program.</p>
