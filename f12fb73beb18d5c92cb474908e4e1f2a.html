<p>An Allegheny County woman was charged Friday with stealing over $500,000 worth of drugs from the pharmacy she worked at, according to the state attorney general’s office.</p>
<p>A state investigating grand jury determined Rena Schleehauf, 33, stole&nbsp;2,206 boxes of an opioid addiction treatment called Suboxone from Johnson’s&nbsp;Pharmaceutical Services in West Mifflin over a three-year period, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges Ms. Schleehauf would order Suboxone through the pharmacy, then place the new inventory in her purse or car, hiding her tracks by destroying or hiding stickers associated with the order. Matthew Johnson, the pharmacy’s owner, told investigators there was security camera footage showing Ms. Schleehauf putting the stolen drugs in her car.</p>
<p>When investigators confronted Ms. Schleehauf, she gave them a handwritten statement admitting the theft, the complaint says. She told investigators she was&nbsp;“stockpiling the Suboxone for her own use,” and she would use between one to 60 doses per day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A search of Ms. Schleehauf’s property turned up 53 doses of Suboxone in her car, plus 4 individual doses, 187 sealed boxes and 338 empty boxes in her home. One box of Suboxone contains 30 doses.</p>
<p>Invoices found by investigators show Ms. Schleehauf stole 66,180 individual doses worth $518,702.85 between August 2016 and July 2019, the complaint says. The orders were unusual for Johnson’s Pharmaceutical, which mainly supplies drugs for assisted living facilities.</p>
<p>“Time and again this defendant ordered drugs, paid for them with company funds, removed them from the company’s inventory once they arrived and then loaded them into her car when no one was watching,” Attorney General Josh Shapiro wrote in a statement. “My Office will continue its work to stop the illegal diversion of prescription medications, and we will continue to prosecute anyone who violates the law.”</p>
<p>Ms. Schleehauf was charged with delivery of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance, theft by unlawful taking and theft by deception.</p>
