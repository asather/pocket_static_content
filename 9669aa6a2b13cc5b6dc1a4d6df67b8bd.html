<h1>COVID-19 Update: Pa. reports 49 new deaths, nearly 700 more cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The state Department of Health reported 49 new COVID-19 deaths and 686 new cases statewide on Friday.</p>
<p>It’s the 32nd consecutive day that the state reported less than 1,000 new cases. The new total for the state is 77,999 cases.&nbsp;The highest increase in cases in Western Pennsylvania was in Erie County, with 31 new cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department on Friday reported 10 new cases of COVID-19 and no new deaths from the respiratory disease.&nbsp;Of the new deaths, five were in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>With the new data, Allegheny County said it has had 2,065 positive cases since March 14. Of them, 1,933 are confirmed and 132 are probable. Allegheny has had a total 173 deaths — 161 are confirmed and 12 are probable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been 355 hospitalizations needed in Allegheny County because of COVID-19. At least 134 of the patients needed intensive care treatment and 69 needed a mechanical ventilator.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and Health Department Director Dr. Debra Bogen said this week that the number of COVID-19 cases continues to remain low, although Mr. Fitzgerald urged residents to remember that despite being in the green reopening phase, “we are still in a pandemic.”</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen also noted that because of the 14-day incubation period of the virus, it is too soon to know if the primary election and civil rights demonstrations in the county could cause a spike in positive cases.</p>
<p>Also this week, the administration of Gov. Tom Wolf issued new guidance on outdoor recreation, saying businesses that offer mountain biking, outdoor mini golf, go carts, rock climbing, paintball, horse riding, tennis, archery or shooting, and similar activities can resume operation with restrictions.Those businesses must keep their indoor spaces off-limits to the public except for restrooms, ticketing and entry. They must also prevent customers from congregating at entry gates, kiosks and concession stands, officials said.</p>
