<h1>After COVID-19 shift to pickup, Giant Eagle to reopen Parkway Center store to the public </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Giant Eagle will reopen its Parkway Center store to public shopping on Thursday after converting the store exclusively to curbside pickup in May.</p>
<p>The O’Hara-based supermarket chain had transitioned to curbside only there to increase contactless shopping options for customers during the pandemic while other area Giant Eagle locations worked to increase their daily pickup and delivery capacity.</p>
<p>That goal has been met, the grocer said Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Same-day and next-day pickup and delivery slots are now available to guests at most locations, and with that, we felt it was time to welcome guests back” to the Parkway Center location, the company said.</p>
<p>The store will reopen to the public Thursday at 7 a.m. Customers will continue to be able to place orders for curbside pickup and home delivery from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.</p>
<p>Giant Eagle operates 220 stores in Pennsylvania and four other states.</p>
