<h1>Testing pre-operative patients, UPMC reports finding no new coronavirus infections over two-week period</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Not one of the 1,000 pre-operative patients checked for novel coronavirus at Pittsburgh-area UPMC facilities over the past two weeks has tested positive for the infection, the network’s chief medical officer said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The results show Western Pennsylvania continuing to see little sign of a surge of COVID-19 patients that could overwhelm hospitals here on the scale that New York City and some other regions have experienced, said Dr. Steven Shapiro, UPMC’s chief medical and scientific officer.</p>
<p>Any new infections are primarily occurring in nursing home residents and among those with other underlying medical conditions, he said.</p>
<p>“In sum, this is a disease of the elderly, sick, and poor,” he said.</p>
<p>When they do get it, those who are younger tend to have less serious symptoms, Dr. Shapiro said, citing the recent coronavirus outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt where 1,102 sailors were infected but seven required hospitalization and only one sailor died.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Because the highly-contagious COVID-19 can be spread by people who show no symptoms, the absence of positive tests among all UPMC’s pre-operative patients is an encouraging sign there are not large numbers of undiagnosed patients here, he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Shapiro made his comments Wednesday as part of a national panel of health experts brought together by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa, for an online discussion about how to “gradually and safely” reopen the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey has been vocal about the need to ease restrictions and restart Pennsylvania’s economy now that initial concerns of an overwhelmed health system have abated. He reiterated that position on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Given how much better experts now understand the nature of the virus, how it is spread, how it can be treated and how it can be prevented by social distancing and other measures, Mr. Toomey said, “I think we have every reason to be optimistic that the worst is behind us.”</p>
<p>That point is being debated vigorously around the country, and in Pennsylvania, as government officials and health and science experts try to calculate the risks in reopening parts of the economy that were halted to curb the spread of the disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, most of Pennsylvania remains under a lock-down order with only businesses that are considered essential remaining open. However, hospitals are now resuming elective surgeries and procedures.</p>
<p>UPMC, unlike other area health systems, had resisted state orders to postpone all scheduled procedures and surgeries to prepare for a possible surge in COVID-19 patients but Dr. Shapiro said Wednesday that they had delayed 70% of non-urgent surgeries.</p>
<p>The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center on Wednesday showed 1.2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. with 71,463 deaths, and new cases averaging between 25,000 and 35,000 daily since early April while starting to trend down slightly.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>While the leveling off of new cases nationally is encouraging, “There are a lot of ifs in this optimism,” said Dr. Mark McClellan of Duke University, a former administrator for the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, like many other states, has moved to contain the spread of the virus by ordering non-essential businesses to temporarily close. But the move has come at a personal cost to many Pennsylvania families —&nbsp;the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry says it has received 1.74 million unemployment compensation claims since mid-March.</p>
<p>Besides Drs. Shapiro and McClellan, the other panelists at Mr. Toomey’s first-of-its-kind discussion&nbsp;on Wednesday included Nobel laureate Paul Romer, an economics professor at New York University; and John Ioannidis, a disease prevention specialist at Stanford University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, the panelists laid out scenarios that would allow a return to pre-COVID routines, with key caveats such as the need for widespread testing and a quick response to positive tests including isolating the infected person to prevent a spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Hard-hit areas such as New York City are still dealing with coronavirus infections on a large scale.</p>
<p>While three of 500 patients at UPMC facilities in Central Pennsylvania did test positive, Dr. Shapiro said, “Our community prevalence is low.”</p>
<p>He said no residents in the health system’s 36 senior facilities have tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Dr. Shapiro argued that as long as steps are taken to protect seniors —&nbsp;particularly those in nursing homes —&nbsp;and people take precautions, the country can buy time until effective treatments and possibly a vaccine is found.</p>
<p>“One thing is certain: Pandemics will be part of our future, and we must be better prepared. We can’t be put in a position to have to choose between death by pathogen or death by our economy.”</p>
