<h1>The Clarks will rock Dependable Drive-In in late June</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A little over a decade ago, The Clarks did an album called “Fast Moving Cars.”</p>
<p>Later this month, the popular Pittsburgh band will be playing to a field of <em>parked</em> cars.</p>
<p>The Clarks will play a two-night stand at Dependable Drive-In in Moon on June 26 (with Gene the Werewolf) and June 27 (with The Hawkeyes). Gates will open at 6 p.m. and the music will start at 8.</p>
<p>How weird will it be playing to a drive-in crowd?</p>
<p>“Probably not much weirder than playing to a phone in my basement,” says Clarks frontman Scott Blasey, who’s been streaming concerts during the pandemic. “But, seriously, just being with the guys and playing together on a stage, even without an audience, would be exhilarating.”</p>
<p>The audio, carried through the PA system and FM transmitters, will allow for people to remain in their cars or sit outside of them.</p>
<p>The concerts come with a long list of restrictions and guidelines, some related to concerns about the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Most importantly, if you are sick, running a fever or have been exposed to COVID-19, they ask that you not attend.</p>
<p>For proper social distancing guidelines, only eTickets will be available.</p>
<p>There will be room for 208 cars in the 400-capacity venue. One car will be parked between each set of poles alternating between the left and right poles each row.</p>
<p>There will be no tailgating and no outside beverages, refreshments or coolers permitted in the grounds. Patrons will be subject to a mandatory trunk check upon entry. Outside food is allowed but may not be delivered to the drive-in. Concession stands are open for walk-up window service, with cash and cards accepted.</p>
<p>Tall and large vehicles, such as trucks, campers and buses, will not be admitted. Pickup trucks and SUVS may be directed to the back of the lot or ends of the aisles, so as to not block the sightlines of other concert-goers. There is no smoking or firearms.</p>
<p>Patrons can watch the show on chairs or blankets from outside of their vehicles, but only in front of them (between the car and stage), not beside.</p>
<p>No gathering or playing in front of the screen or in the grass. When leaving your space to visit the concession stand or use the restroom, wear a facemask and maintain six feet of social distancing.</p>
<p>Only two people are allowed in the restrooms at one time, except for parents with multiple children. Restrooms will briefly close periodically for sanitizing.</p>
<p>The show will continue rain or shine. At the conclusion, remain in your parking space until directed by event staff to exit the lot. In the case of an emergency, remain in your space until directed by event staff.</p>
<p>The guidelines are temporary, and will be changed accordingly as the COVID-19 situation evolves. Failure to follow guidelines will result in removal from the drive-in without a refund.</p>
<p>General admission car tickets are $100 (up to four occupants per vehicle). Limited VIP tickets, allowing access in the first three rows in front of the stage, will be available for $130. For both ticket types, parking will be general admission (first come, first serve). On day of show, there will be a charge of $30 per person over the four-person limit. Tickets are on sale now at Eventbrite.com and DruskyEnt.com. A portion of proceeds will go to the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. The concert is presented by 105.9 The X, 102.5 WDVE, Drusky Entertainment and Rich Engler Presents.</p>
<p>The drive-in trend began in Denmark with Danish artist Mads Langer performing a sold-out concert on April 24. Keith Urban did a surprise drive-in show in Tennessee on May 15. On June 11, electronic musician Marc Rebillet is launching an eight-city Drive-In Tour in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p>The Clarks show is the first drive-in concert scheduled for this area.</p>
