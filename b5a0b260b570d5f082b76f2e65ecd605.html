<p>Antwon Rose II was fatally shot by East Pittsburgh police Michael Rosfeld in June 2018 at the age of 17. Rosfeld was acquitted in March of last year, but the Steelers will honor Rose’s life this year, starting with Week 1 at the New York Giants on “Monday Night Football.”</p>
<p>The back of each player’s helmet will have&nbsp;“Antwon Rose Jr.” at the bottom underneath their jersey numbers. It’s the same <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/other-sports/2020/09/13/Philadelphia-Eagles-running-back-Miles-Sanders-tribute-Antwon-Rose-II/stories/202009130184" target="_blank">decal worn Sunday by second-year Philadelphia Eagles running back Miles Sanders</a>, like Rose a Woodland Hills High School alumnus.</p>
<p>This season, the NFL has allowed teams and players to don the names of victims of systemic racism in the wake of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others who were killed or injured by police officers in 2020. But according to the Steelers, they all chose Rose, the most notable case of police brutality in their own city.</p>
<p>“When you think about Antwon Rose’s story, we don’t want to ever let his legacy go away,” team captain Cam Heyward told Steelers.com, the team website. “That kid had a bright future and he was taken away too early. We see all of these things happening across our country now. This hit home.”</p>
