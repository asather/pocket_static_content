<h1>Widespread cancelation of worship believed to be first in a century</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When it comes to living memory, few people have more of it than the Very Rev. Igor Soroka. The Orthodox priest graduated from seminary in 1946, spent 13 years as a music leader at various parishes and another 58 years as a priest in Donora before retiring in 2017.</p>
<p>And even for him, this is the first time&nbsp;in living memory that worship services have been canceled almost universally in southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“I never witnessed anything like this,” said Father Soroka, 94, of Monongahela, retired pastor of St. Nicholas Orthodox Church in Donora.</p>
<p>Although no one interviewed knew definitively, this appears to be the first time since the 1918 influenza epidemic that the region has seen such wholesale closings of religious services. Health officials ordered the city’s churches closed for much of October 1918.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bishop David Zubik canceled public Masses as of Monday throughout the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, a day after parishes held Masses with lower-than-normal attendance after Pennsylvania bishops waived the normal mandate for weekend Mass attendance.</p>
<p>But as information about the spread of the virus developed over the weekend, Bishop Zubik said it was clear that Masses and other large worship gatherings, optional or not, should be canceled.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to help everybody understand that as a church that really advocates profile issues, we have to be concerned about the entire population, and we can’t take risks,” he said.&nbsp;“That’s why I suspended the celebration of public Masses. Hopefully people can understand the reason for doing that.”</p>
<p>Through the weekend, houses of worship ranging from Protestant megachurches with multiple cameras to small parishes with propped-up cell phones livestreamed their services to empty seats and, they hoped, live worshipers at home or elsewhere on their phones and computers. Mayor Bill Peduto has now banned gatherings of more than 50, which his office says extends to houses of worship.</p>
<p>The Rev. Liddy Barlow, executive minister of the ecumenical group Christian Associates of Southwest Pennsylvania, said she viewed livestreamed services from at least 14 denominational groups on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>“I went into the morning feeling just as overwhelmed, stressed out, and fearful as most people are feeling these days, and I found that the cascade of worship, in all kinds and styles, made a real difference in my outlook and mood,” she said.</p>
<p>“It was deeply comforting to be with God’s people in prayer … all while sitting at my dining room table sipping tea,” she said.</p>
<p>Bishop Zubik is asking Catholic churches to keep their doors open for private prayer. If weddings, funerals or baptisms are scheduled, he’s asking that attendees be limited, such as to immediate family. Confirmations scheduled for March are postponed, with the schedule for April to be evaluated as it draws closer.</p>
<p>Parking-lot confessions were considered, but Bishop Zubik said it would be difficult to maintain confidentiality, so he’s asking priests to have them in a more open area than the confessional.</p>
<p>Seminarians at St. Paul Seminary in East Carnegie are being sent home for the time being, and before they left, Bishop Zubik said they arranged an all-night adoration of the Blessed Sacrament at their chapel there, on behalf of all affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>“They really understood,” he said.&nbsp;“When we told them (of the need to go home), they said,&nbsp;‘We really want to ramp up our own prayer.’”</p>
<p>Greensburg Bishop Edward Malesic issued similar directives, suspending public Masses as well as Lenten fish fries.</p>
<p>The Rev. James Gretz arranged to have the Blessed Sacrament, an object of Catholic devotion, placed just inside the glass doorways of St. Bonaventure Church in Glenshaw and St. Aloysius in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I wanted to have people have the opportunity to pray” even if they couldn’t come in the building, he said.</p>
<p>The Rev. Alek Schrenk, parochial vicar at Ss. Simon and Jude Catholic Church in Green Tree, said while the crisis is unprecedented in most people’s lifetimes,&nbsp;“this is not without precedent in the history of the church.” He cited priests in past centuries who held street corner Masses in times of plague.</p>
<p>“That’s as virtual as you could get in the 16th century,” he said.</p>
<p>The Rev. David Bonnar, administrator of St. Bernard and Our Lady of Grace parishes in the South Hills, noted that Catholics are coming into&nbsp;“prime time for sacramental grace,” with people seeking confessions before Easter and many scheduled to join the church as adult converts, while youths are going through first communions or confirmations. Some weddings are already being postponed.</p>
<p>“When we had 9/11, which was devastating, it brought us all to a stop, but there was a sense that after a few days we were able to begin moving on with our lives,” he recalled. “People came to church, they prayed, sports resumed, and it helped us to cheer again.</p>
<p>“But this is so different,” he said.&nbsp;“The whole world is at a grinding stop, schools are closed, sports have been suspended, theaters are dark, restaurants and bars and cafes are closed and shuttered.”</p>
<p>The parish has started a committee to help people reach out to those who need groceries or other supplies .</p>
<p>“We certainly want to be present to our people, and we don’t want to stop being the church, even though we really are restricted in how we can be the church,” Father Bonnar said.</p>
