<h1>You can wash your hands. But can you wash your smartphone?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Your smartphone is disgusting. And now, you can do a little bit more to make it less so.</p>
<p>That first point isn’t new. An oft-cited 2012 study by the University of Arizona — <a href="https://cals.arizona.edu/news/why-your-cellphone-has-more-germs-toilet" target="_blank">yep, we’re citing it too</a> — revealed that a typical smartphone carries 12 times the bacteria than a common toilet seat. That’s not as awful as it sounds, though — toilet seats generally are cleaned frequently, while it’s tough to thoroughly clean electronic devices. And most of the bacteria found on your iThing comes from you, and is generally harmless.</p>
<p>But but but, you ask — what about COVID-19 germs?</p>
<p>Great question. And until recently, Apple — the manufacturer of our iThings — didn’t have an especially satisfying answer. The company’s cleaning advice in the past has suggested using a soft, lint-free cloth; of course, that will successfully clean fingerprints and other grime from your phone, but it won’t do much to disinfect it.</p>
<p>For the first time, though, Apple has offered a suggestion for doing more to make sure your phone is more than just fingerprint-free. On Monday, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204172?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">Apple released new guidelines that say using&nbsp;70% isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes</a> on the hard, exterior surfaces of your devices is OK — as long as you’re careful.</p>
<p>Note: No bleach. Don’t submerge your phone in any kind of liquid. And if you get moisture inside your device, it’s probably best to make a service call.</p>
<p>Also note that Apple’s new cleaning guidelines offered no advice about where consumers might <em>find</em> Clorox Disinfecting Wipes.</p>
<p>There is one other option for the hardcore gadget person. <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a31224352/how-clean-phone-guide/" target="_blank">Popular Mechanics says that we can purchase UV-C devices that bathe your beloved iThing in ultraviolet light</a>, which kills 99 % of germs instantly. They cost about $80, and unlike disinfectant wipes, they’re actually in stock. For now, anyway.</p>
