<h1>Postseason success of small-market clubs shows Pirates have long way to go</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s hard to argue with the assertion that spending makes life easier in Major League Baseball. Money buys talent, covers up developmental warts and enables teams to patch holes from year-to-year. There’s a reason — OK, millions of them — six of the past 10 World Series winners ranked 11th or higher in spending.</p>
<p>But it’s also extremely possible to do it on a tight budget, as we’re seeing once again this year, although the MLB postseason has also been a frustrating referendum on how far the Pirates seem to be from cracking the code — or functioning as a top-end bottom-spender.</p>
<p>In reality, the Pirates find themselves in an abyss. They don’t spend. They haven’t been to the playoffs since 2015.&nbsp; And the teams still playing have taken their players and helped them improve, while the Pirates have been left with precious little in return.</p>
<p>“We know we have work to do to get better,” general manager Ben Cherington said on his season-ending Zoom call last week. “We have to be honest about where we are and also have belief and optimism about where we can go and the improvement we can make.”</p>
<p>After analyzing the postseason field, especially the small-market teams left, there’s plenty to cull from the entire picture, starting with the idea that winning is absolutely possible on a shoestring budget. The Pirates have simply made too many missteps, the former regime really making things difficult for Cherington and company.</p>
<p>For proof of that, just look at the playoff field, which expanded to 16 teams this season. Of those 16 slots, nine were occupied by teams in the bottom half of the payroll table, with seven going to the top 15 spenders.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Rays won 40 games and advanced to the American League Division Series with a prorated payroll that ranked 28th at $28,290,689. That led to a cost-per-win figure of $707,267.23, which was by far the best in MLB.</p>
<p>The Pirates, who have said they want to be more like the Rays, paid almost twice as much ($1,320,412.47) for each of their 19 wins, a figure that trailed four of the 16 playoff clubs and wasn’t much better than NL Central rival Milwaukee ($1,377,037.45), which also reached the postseason. Pittsburgh had MLB’s second-lowest payroll behind Baltimore at $25,087,837.</p>
<p>Unlike the Pirates, these clubs have done significantly more with less. The Marlins, for example, had a $31,330,593 prorated payroll, but they also had 20 players with even or positive Wins Above Average (WAA) marks, according to Baseball-Reference.com (minimum 10 games for hitters, five for pitchers).</p>
<p>The Pirates had just 12, which is less than half of what Tampa (25) achieved.</p>
<p>In fact, while the Rays combined for 7.4 Wins Above Average, the Pirates were dead last at minus-14.5 — more than five wins worse than the 29th-place team (Detroit), which marked the largest disparity between two clubs across MLB.</p>
<p>The other clubs who’ve won without spending a ton of cash have also been on the better end of trades, which is one of the major reasons why owner Bob Nutting made massive changes last offseason.</p>
<p>That part has been painfully obvious, as Pirates fans have been treated to plenty of Tyler Glasnow, Gerrit Cole, Austin Meadows, Charlie Morton, Mark Melancon, Starling Marte and Corey Dickerson. Ditto for JA Happ and Matt Joyce, who are in the postseason but left Pittsburgh as free agents.</p>
<p>Sadly for the Pirates, the totality of those trades netted the Pirates just 1.2 fWAR in 2020 — and that involves down years from Meadows and Morton (combined .7 fWAR). It will never match what was given up, but Pirates fans must hope that Liover Peguero and Brennan Malone, acquired in the Marte deal, pick up some of the slack.</p>
<p>This is also where the road starts to split when we’re talking about the Pirates and the actual code-crackers, especially as it pertains to drafting well and executing smart trades. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<p>• In 2014, the A’s flipped pitcher Jeff Samardzija into a solid return highlighted by shortstop Marcus Semien and Chris Bassitt. Semien got MVP votes last year, while Bassitt has exemplified Cherington’s desire to help players improve; after a slow start to his career, Bassitt has been worth 3.4 fWAR over the past two seasons.</p>
<p>• They’ve also made smart first-round picks. Third baseman Matt Chapman and first baseman Matt Olson have been worth 26.8 fWAR — plus four Gold Gloves — before either has reached arbitration.</p>
<p>• The Marlins have made some smart moves, too. Rookie sensation Sixto Sanchez came back in the J.T. Realmuto trade, while Brian Anderson — Miami’s WAR leader (1.7) per Baseball-Reference.com — had a $585,000 full-season salary in 2020. He was a third-round pick in 2014.</p>
<p>The Pirates, of course, haven’t done the stuff often enough. They’ve received steady reminders, too, as Astros reliever Blake Taylor became the latest to torment his original team, earning a win in relief in Game 1 of the ALDS against Oakland on Monday.</p>
<p>Taylor, in case you forgot, was the “player to be named later” in the Ike Davis trade. The Mets traded Taylor to Houston for Jake Marisnick, and the Astros converted him to a reliever. The second-round pick of the Pirates in 2013 had a 2.18 ERA in 20 2/3 regular-season innings in 2020.</p>
<p>Not only has the return on trades lacked, but the Pirates’ farm system has been no better from all the upheaval. Once one of the best in the game, the Pirates are just 16th according to MLB Pipeline’s latest rankings.</p>
<p>They have three top 100 prospects, though one is Ke’Bryan Hayes and another is Oneil Cruz, who the Pirates must hope does not face serious legal trouble after a fatal accident in the Dominican Republic. The Marlins, meanwhile, are fifth and boast six top-100 prospects, while the Rays sit firmly atop the list.</p>
<p>So while it probably makes you want to throw the remote at the TV every time Cole or Glasnow pitches, or whenever you dig deeper into the Pirates’ inglorious and steep fall from grace, remember this: It is possible for the Pirates to climb back up the mountain. But as Cherington said, they certainly have a lot of work to do.</p>
