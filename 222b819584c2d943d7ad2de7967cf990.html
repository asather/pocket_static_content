<h1>Jason Mackey: Breaking down the Pirates’ possible trade candidates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s hardly an ideal situation for Pirates general manager Ben Cherington.</p>
<p>Had this trade deadline occurred during a normal season, with expected performances to peddle, Cherington might’ve had more to sell. He also would be able to get a better read on opposing teams’ top prospects, especially those down-the-road guys who might not be working out at alternate training sites.</p>
<p>At the same time, for Cherington to take meaningful steps toward the Pirates’ long-term rebuild — or whatever they want to call it — he’ll likely need to get a couple things done by the Aug. 31 trade deadline.</p>
<p>While proposing full trade packages can be tricky, if not impossible, the hope here is to outline Cherington’s inventory:</p>
<p><strong>The attractive options</strong></p>
<p>Most likely to go is closer Keone Kela, who is currently sidelined with right forearm tightness. An unrestricted free agent at season’s end, Kela won’t be back; so, get something for him.</p>
<p>Kela’s season was delayed by COVID-19, but he’s looked terrific since returning, touching 97 mph with his fastball and showcasing that hammer curve. This from someone who allowed one earned run with 25 strikeouts over his final 24 appearances of 2019.</p>
<p>If this was only about ability, the Pirates would have no issue moving Kela. But it’s not. This latest arm issue is the third Kela has endured since the start of last season, even though it appears minor. And Kela would also come with questions given his reputation, whether those are fair or not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, assuming Kela shows this week that he’s healthy, there’s a good chance a contender will acquire Kela for bullpen help.</p>
<p>An under-the-radar option might be Richard Rodriguez, who made a career-high 72 appearances last season, tied for eighth among National League relievers.</p>
<p>Not only has Rodriguez pitched a lot, but he’s been solid; among NL relievers with at least 55 appearances since June 1, 2019, his ERA of 2.47 is the lowest.</p>
<p>Although he’s 30 years old, Rodriguez has three more years of club control, as he’s arbitration-eligible for the first time this winter. Also, his full-season salary for 2020 ($633,500) is crazy cheap.</p>
<p>The other player on this list is Adam Frazier, who attracted interest at MLB’s winter meetings after he was a Gold Glove finalist in 2019. At the plate, Frazier slashed .278/.336/.417 with an OPS of .753 in 152 games.</p>
<p>This week could be big Frazier, who seems to be breaking out of his slump. The 27-year-old has three home runs, seven RBIs and a .250 average over his past 11 games (10 starts). If Frazier gets hot, the interest might spark, too.</p>
<p><strong>The second tier</strong></p>
<p>Good starting pitchers are never a bad thing to be peddling at the trade deadline. Believe it or not, the Pirates may have a couple of those.</p>
<p>While Derek Holland — a 33-year-old on an expiring contract — might be the most obvious, Trevor Williams provides an intriguing option, as well.</p>
<p>MLB Network’s Jon Morosi reported that the Blue Jays were considering Williams and Chad Kuhl. It wasn’t surprising given the familiarity between the front offices, but it would make sense for several teams to look at Williams, and here’s why:</p>
<p>Contract-wise, Williams is 28 and headed into his second year of arbitration. His 2020 salary number is $2.825 million, and that should increase again this winter. With Williams unlikely to be around for the long haul of the Pirates rebuild — or whatever they want to call it — it might make sense to make the move now.</p>
<p>In five starts, Williams has a 3.70 ERA, down from 5.38 a season ago. Although the sample size is obviously small, Williams is averaging a career-high 8.51 strikeouts per nine innings and has gotten back to inducing weak contact.</p>
<p>Among MLB starters with at least 20 innings pitched, Williams has the 14th-lowest rate of hard contact (34.7%), according to FanGraphs.</p>
<p>Williams is also plus-plus in the character department. He’s personable and well-liked by teammates, the perfect guy to jump aboard a new team and assimilate in no time.</p>
<p>Holland is a wild card. He’s pitched five times for the Pirates, four of those in starts. His 6.17 ERA isn’t great, but it’s also misleading. The Tigers rocked Holland for nine earned runs and five homers in an 11-5 Pirates loss on Aug. 8. If you extract that outing, Holland’s ERA drops to 3.44.</p>
<p>Even though he’s got a fun personality and has provided the Pirates with veteran leadership, there’s zero reason for them to keep Holland. If there’s a deal there, make it.</p>
<p>As for Kuhl, there are two schools of thought here. One, as Kuhl is coming off Tommy John surgery, the Pirates could decide to cash in his stock now, believing that he won’t stay healthy long-term. That’s unlikely.</p>
<p>It makes more sense for them ride this out. Kuhl has shown himself to be a different pitcher post-Tommy John, one with elite breaking stuff. If they pull the trigger on a trade now when Kuhl has potentially remade himself and matured, they could be looking at another situation where a pitcher goes elsewhere and truly finds himself. Think&nbsp;Charlie Morton 2.0.</p>
<p>The smart move is to stick with Kuhl, trust that he’ll stay healthy, and that what we’ve seen thus far will continue. The upside of a marginal Blue Jays prospect isn’t worth it.</p>
<p><strong>The question marks</strong></p>
<p>When the Pirates acquired Jarrod Dyson this offseason, outside of his hilarious quote, the most obvious reaction might’ve been this: If Dyson plays well, there’s no way he finishes the season with them.</p>
<p>That seems tough to comprehend now.</p>
<p>Although Dyson picked up a pair of hits Sunday, he was still slashing .167/.231/.167 entering Tuesday. For a 36-year-old, that’s not going to net a trade.</p>
<p>Dyson’s speed has been evident with four stolen bases. He has also defended well, and he’s been a solid veteran in taking Cole Tucker under his wing in center. That’s what he should be doing.</p>
<p>But a trade is likely too tough to pull off given how little Dyson has produced, unless he goes absolutely bonkers before next Monday.</p>
<p>Erik Gonzalez is another interesting case. Before this season, the Pirates likely would’ve traded Gonzalez for a bag of balls. Now, it’s complicated. And it may be out of their hands.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether the Pirates see Gonzalez, 28, as part of their long-term plans as a utility type or whether they might try to capitalize on his strong start by getting something — anything — for him at the deadline.</p>
<p>The good news is that Gonzalez makes just $725,000 and the Pirates also have him under club control for another two years. So, they don’t necessarily have to do anything now.</p>
<p>But for the same reason that they might want to move Frazier, they have young guys they’ll need to play: Ke’Bryan Hayes at third; Oneil Cruz and/or Liover Peguero at shortstop; Nick Gonzales at short or second; and even Jason Martin and Jared Oliva in the outfield, which could return Tucker to the infield.</p>
<p>This one might be dictated by whether or not there’s outside interest.</p>
<p><strong>The long shots</strong></p>
<p>Gregory Polanco enjoyed a terrific weekend series and may have finally rediscovered his swing.</p>
<p>Does that make this the perfect time to trade him?</p>
<p>OK, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Polanco has a full-season salary of $8 million and will make $11 million in 2021, with no buyout options until 2022. No team anywhere is going to commit that sort of money to a player with Polanco’s medical/production history based on three games.</p>
<p>That shouldn’t stop the Pirates from trying.</p>
<p>Perhaps another team might see value here, giving up little and probably having the Pirates pick up some of the fare for a player they believe they can fix.</p>
<p>Again, it’s a long shot. But sometimes the Hail Mary works.</p>
<p>Like Dyson, Chris Archer was another player who, at the beginning of the season, few saw finishing 2020 with the Pirates. Now, it requires some creativity to figure out a way for him to wind up as part of a trade.</p>
<p>But the issue preventing Archer from staying here long-term — a $250,000 buyout after 2020 — might be the same one that makes a deal work, perhaps as part of a bigger package.</p>
<p>Think about it: The Tampa Bay Rays, Archer’s former employer, have rehabbed pitchers before. They know Archer. Perhaps they see something there and think they can bring it back out after Archer returns from surgery to relieve symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome.</p>
<p>No, Archer’s $11 million salary for 2021 isn’t workable, but for a team like Tampa where there’s some previously built trust — and not to mention the fact that Archer still lives close to Tropicana Field — a prove-it deal for next season might make sense. And after the last one, here’s guessing the Rays wouldn’t mind doing a little more business with the Pirates.</p>
<p>The last non-traditional option here is Will Craig, the Pirates’ first-round pick in 2016. Craig won a minor league Gold Glove at first base in 2019 and has 43 home runs and 180 RBIs the past two years combined, but he’s seemingly never mentioned when the Pirates talk about prospects.</p>
<p>Is Craig a part of the future? Is he blocked by Josh Bell or simply not thought highly of by the new regime? It’s hard to tell given Craig’s quiet spring and the lack of opportunities that have popped up since.</p>
<p>But if he’s legitimately not a part of the Pirates’ long-term plans at first base, then perhaps Craig might serve as some sort of pot-sweetener.</p>
