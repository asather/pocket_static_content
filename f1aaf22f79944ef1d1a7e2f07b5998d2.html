<h1>Protests erupt, National Guard called in as video shows Wis. police shooting Black man in back multiple times</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The video starts as Jacob Blake rounds the front of a silver SUV on Sunday, with two Kenosha, Wis., police officers following close behind, their guns drawn. When Mr. Blake opens the door and steps inside, the officers suddenly fire toward his back — at least seven times.</p>
<p>Mr. Blake is in serious condition, the officers have been placed on administrative leave and the city of Kenosha declared an emergency curfew after protests rocked the city into early Monday morning.</p>
<p>The video footage quickly spread online. It comes as the country has faced monthslong protests spurred by George Floyd’s May death in Minneapolis, setting off the wave of demonstrations against police brutality and for racial justice.</p>
<p>Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, called for greater police accountability as the video spread rapidly across social media.</p>
<p>“While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country,” Mr. Evers said in a statement. “We stand with all those who have and continue to demand justice, equity, and accountability for Black lives in our country.”</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Evers on Monday called in the National Guard. He said 125 members of the guard would be in Kenosha by night and would take responsibility for “guarding infrastructure and making sure our firefighters and others involved are protected.”</p>
<p>The Kenosha shooting made the lakefront city of about 100,000 residents the new epicenter of a movement that has roiled America this summer, ever since the video footage of Floyd, pinned beneath a Minneapolis police officer’s knee and pleading for air, circulated on Memorial Day.</p>
<p>Since then, cities from coast to coast have seen their streets filled with demonstrations, which in some cases have given way to violence and property damage. Activists have called for cities to cut funding to police departments, among other changes. Some officials have vowed to push through reforms, while others — including President Donald Trump and his conservative allies — have pushed back, arguing that police are facing unfair criticism.</p>
<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, said in a statement that the country “wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force.”</p>
<p>“This calls for an immediate, full and transparent investigation and the officers must be held accountable,” Mr. Biden said. “These shots pierce the soul of our nation.”</p>
<p>On Monday, Mr. Evers signed an executive order calling the Wisconsin Legislature into a special session for Aug. 31 to focus on law enforcement uses of force and training, among other issues. In a news briefing, Mr. Evers called on people who demonstrate to “please do so peacefully” and asked them to wear masks and try to maintain social distancing, given the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Republicans and the police union accused the politicians of rushing to judgment, reflecting the deep partisan divide in Wisconsin, a key presidential battleground state. Wisconsin GOP members also decried the violent protests, echoing the law-and-order theme that Mr. Trump has been using in his re-election campaign.</p>
<p>“As always, the video currently circulating does not capture all the intricacies of a highly dynamic incident,” Pete Deates president of the Kenosha police union, said in a statement. He called the governor’s statement “wholly irresponsible.”</p>
<p>The shooting in Kenosha, located between Milwaukee and Chicago, occurred after 5 p.m. Sunday, when officers responded to a domestic incident, police said. Witnesses told the Kenosha News that Mr. Blake was trying to break up a fight and that police first attempted to stun him with a Taser.</p>
<p>The video shows neighbors congregated outside as two police officers — with their guns drawn — follow Mr. Blake as he approaches the car. As Mr. Blake opens the driver’s side door, an officer is seen tugging at his white tank top before the police fire multiple shots, at least seven, while Mr. Blake’s back is turned.</p>
<p>Kenosha News reported that Mr. Blake was shot in front of his children.</p>
<p>A young man who said he made a widely seen cellphone video of the shooting, 22-year-old Raysean White, said he saw Mr. Blake scuffling with three officers and heard them yell, “Drop the knife! Drop the knife!” before the gunfire erupted. But he said he didn’t see a knife in Mr. Blake’s hands.</p>
<p>Mr. White said that before the gunfire, he looked out his window and saw six or seven women shouting at each other on the sidewalk. A few moments later, Mr. Blake drove up in his SUV and told his son, who was standing nearby, to get in the vehicle, Mr. White said. Mr. White said Mr. Blake did not say anything to the women.</p>
<p>Mr. White said he left the window to use the bathroom for a few minutes; when he came back, he saw three officers wrestling with Mr. Blake. One punched Mr. Blake in the ribs, and another used a stun gun on him, Mr. White said. He said Mr. Blake got free and started walking away as officers yelled about a knife.</p>
<p>Soon after, seven shots can be heard, though it isn’t clear how many struck Mr. Blake or how many officers fired. During the shooting, a Black woman can be seen in the video, screaming in the street and jumping up and down.</p>
<p>Benjamin Crump, a civil rights lawyer who has represented the families of many people fatally shot by police, said Monday that he had been retained by Mr. Blake’s family.</p>
<p>Mr. Crump said in a statement that Mr. Blake’s “three sons witnessed their father collapse after being riddled with bullets.” According to Mr. Crump, Mr. Blake was “simply trying to do the right thing by intervening in a domestic incident,” and he did not elaborate on what that entailed.</p>
<p>“It’s a miracle he’s still alive,” Mr. Crump said.</p>
<p>Police have not commented on what led to the shooting. Mr. Blake was taken by helicopter to Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee, police said. Early Monday, TMJ4 reported that Mr. Blake’s brother said he is out of surgery and in intensive care.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating the shooting, officials said.</p>
<p>As footage of Mr. Blake’s shooting spread Sunday on social media, a crowd gathered at the intersection where he was shot. Tensions quickly rose as more police officers arrived in riot gear. Several police cars were damaged. A video shows one officer being hit with a brick and collapsing.</p>
<p>The group eventually moved away from the intersection. A live stream of a march through Kenosha showed hundreds congregating and chanting outside the Kenosha County Public Safety Building after 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, the city declared a state of emergency and instituted an overnight curfew. A public safety alert suggested that 24-hour businesses close “due to numerous armed robberies and shots fired calls.”</p>
<p>Police soon arrived with riot gear and armed with rubber bullets; they eventually sprayed tear gas at the crowd. Some protesters targeted garbage trucks that had been parked to block traffic, shattering the trucks’ windows and setting them ablaze.</p>
<p>After midnight, the crowds moved toward the courthouse, and someone set a fire outside the building, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Police put out the fire and launched more tear gas. Another livestream showed people breaking into a nearby government building and shattering the glass doors and windows from the inside.</p>
<p>Just past 1 a.m., police requested that protesters leave the area, the Journal Sentinel reported, before firing more tear gas. About 20 minutes later, police formed a riot line and moved people away. Then, after 2 a.m., someone set fire to a car outside a dealership. By 2:40 a.m., smoke billowed toward the sky as car after car burst into flames. An hour later, the fire continued to spread, threatening a church behind the dealership.</p>
<p>On Monday, Kenosha County announced another curfew, this one set to run from 8 p.m. Monday through 7 a.m. Tuesday. The curfew was set for the area east of Interstate 94, with police saying the public had “to be off the streets for their safety.”</p>
<p>Video of Mr. Blake’s shooting ignited widespread outrage and inspired a smaller protest in Madison, the capital of Wisconsin. Julián Castro, former San Antonio mayor and Democratic presidential candidate, questioned whether the police had considered “nonlethal methods.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t officers physically restrain him? Or use their Tasers? Or disable the vehicle?” Mr. Castro asked.</p>
<p>Bernice King, Martin Luther King Jr.’s daughter and the chief executive of the King Center, tweeted that she was dismayed to see another video of a Black person being “brutalized and/or gunned down by police.”</p>
<p>“Anybody who doesn’t believe we are beyond a state of emergency is choosing to lack empathy and awareness,” Ms. King said.</p>
