<h1>From disc jockeys to development, key Homewood building slated for a rehab</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Homewood building that once housed the WURP radio station, a barbershop and a dentist is now a target for revitalization.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority board members are expected to vote Thursday on whether to sell the vacant James T. Givner Building at 627 N. Homewood Ave. to Operation Better Block for $1 plus costs.</p>
<p>The sale represents the launching point for a proposed $2.3 million redevelopment that would include two street-level retailers and six one-bedroom apartments on the upper floors, four of which would be available to households with incomes at or below 50% of the area median income.</p>
<p>Also Thursday, the board is poised to select developers for six revitalization projects in the Centre Avenue corridor in the Hill District resulting from a request for qualifications issued last summer.</p>
<p>As part of the Givner Building rehab, Operation Better Block already has lined up two tenants to occupy the retail space — Dana’s Bakery and Roux Orleans, a Caribbean restaurant.</p>
<p>In addition to the four apartments that will be rented to those at or below 50% of the AMI, two one-bedroom units also will be available to households with incomes at or below 80% of the AMI.</p>
<p>“This building is key to both the history and the future of Homewood, and I’m very happy the URA and Operation Better Block are supporting its rebirth,” Mayor Bill Peduto said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to the URA, the Givner Building has been a key component of the Homewood business district over the years and will now help to anchor development at the N. Homewood Avenue and Kelly Street intersection. Besides harboring the radio station, barber and dentist, the structure also served as the home to the Homewood-Brushton Revitalization &amp; Development Corp.</p>
<p>To help with the rehab, the URA board plans to vote on $738,000 in loans and $385,000 in grants to Operation Better Block, which is serving a developer and property manager for the project.</p>
<p>The money would be used to help with renovations —&nbsp;including roofing, interior finishes, furnishings and support structures as well as door and window modifications and accessibility improvements. It also will go toward the landscaping of an adjacent lot that will be used for outdoor seating and green space.</p>
<p>In the Hill District, the URA is seeking to enter into exclusive negotiations for the next six months with six developers for the sale of the parcels needed for their projects. They are:</p>
<p>• Amani Christian Community Development Corp. for the redevelopment of the former African Queens building and adjacent lots into ground floor commercial space and upper-floor affordable apartments;</p>
<p>• MOKA Art Gallery for the purchase of a vacant lot behind the gallery to provide green space for community music and art.</p>
<p>• Salon XO and Bridging the Gap Development for the purchase and rehab of an existing structure into a new upscale salon with a first-floor spa and wellness center and upper-level apartments with rents at 50% of the AMI. A second phase involves the construction of a mixed-use development;</p>
<p>• Studio Volcy for Rhythm Square, which includes the rehab of the former Contractors Department Store building at 2225 Centre Ave., the Center Builders Supply Building at 2237 Centre, and vacant land between the two. The properties would be used for gallery space, micro-restaurants, live-work space and affordable housing.</p>
<p>• The Sankofa Group for the purchase of vacant land to house Sankofa Square, a three-story building with retail and offices and parking lot, and Sankofa Estates, an eight- to 12-unit mixed income, multifamily development;</p>
<p>• Thomas Boyd, owner of Big Tom’s Barbershop in the Hill, for the purchase and redevelopment of the former Hamm’s Barbershop building. He’s planning to relocate his business there and to add upper-floor apartments rented to those at 50% to 80% of the AMI and an outdoor deck and lounge space.</p>
<p>Also Thursday, the URA board is expected to vote on finalizing the sale of a building it owns at 604 Liberty Ave., Downtown, to Hitchhiker Brewing Co. for $120,000 plus costs. Hitchhiker is planning to sell beer and cold-brewed, nitrogenated coffee that pours like beer at the location.</p>
