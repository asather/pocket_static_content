<h1>In an about-face, Edinboro U. now plans mainly online instruction this fall</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Edinboro University on Wednesday did an about-face and announced it will move nearly all its instruction online this fall and drastically limit those able to live on campus amid a spike in COVID-19 cases in Pennsylvania and nationally.</p>
<p>The university alerted students in an email Wednesday afternoon and said the school with 4,800 students will allow only 175 on campus, a fraction of the norm. They include international students and others enrolled in a course with an experiential component that is being taught in person and is required for their major.</p>
<p>Edinboro becomes the third of Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities to announce an abrupt change in fall plans, and it comes as a number of campuses in other states also have reversed course on plans for a residential campus experience. Edinboro is canceling all dorm assignments made prior to July 21 and will process refunds for students who already paid, officials said.</p>
<p>Edinboro President Guiyou Huang called it a hard but necessary decision and said he realized that many had already firmed up their plans.</p>
<p>"I am writing to share the news that after careful consideration, we have decided to move most of our courses online for the fall semester and to significantly limit the number of students living on campus," he wrote. "I realize that this news is being sent after many of you have solidified your return-to-campus arrangements, but in this incredibly fluid situation, with COVID-19 cases surging in Pennsylvania and many other states, we believe this is the best way to minimize the health risks to our students, faculty and staff."</p>
<p>The move is likely to fuel angst among students and parents at other schools including those within the&nbsp;State System of Higher Education, many of which like Edinboro previously announced plans to bring students back and teach a blend of in-person and remote classes. Edinboro had planned to do so as recently as last week, and was expecting to welcome freshmen on Aug. 12.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/07/10/West-Chester-State-System-of-Higher-Education-COVID-19-fall-online-Fiorentino/stories/202007100115" target="_blank">West Chester University </a>and East Stroudsburg so far are the only others among the 14 State System universities that have shifted their focus to online for the fall, said David Pidgeon, a spokesman the State System in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I can’t speculate on whether others will, too,” he said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials with Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Clarion University and California University of Pennsylvania told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Wednesday that their plans to return students to campus for blended in-person and online classes have not changed. Slippery Rock University also is proceeding as planned, though it has moved to a smaller share of in-person classes, spokesman Robb King said.</p>
<p>“We’re still planning on a mix. However, while we were originally looking at a 50/50 split, we’re know looking at closer to 80% online,” he explained.</p>
<p>Nearly 96,000 students attend the State System campuses, located in parts of the state with widely varying numbers of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>About 142,000 Americans have died form the virus, and the increase in cases this summer has occurred as much of the country began reopening for business after being shuttered to slow the virus's spread.</p>
<p>Edinboro is in Erie County, which has 692 confirmed cases as of this week, according to the state Department of Health. By comparison, Allegheny County has 6,471 cases and Philadelphia County has 24,084 cases.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang, Edinboro’s president, said students and families will be receiving additional information to guide them through the changes. Those who are allowed to live in dorms will have separate bedrooms and bathrooms and will be charged $3,000.</p>
<p>“While most courses will be taught remotely, a subset of courses will incorporate some in-person teaching that may transition to virtual delivery should the virus situation worsen,” he said. “These include some art studios, labs, nursing clinicals and similar courses.</p>
<p>“A list of offerings with in-person components will be shared with you later today. Please watch your campus email for a link,” he added.</p>
<p>“Students: Your faculty members will make sure that course requirements are clearly explained and will work hard to ensure that you have the best possible experience in every class,” the president said.</p>
<p>This spring, as student sentiment favoring a return to in-person classes grew apparent, public and private campuses prepared elaborate strategies to reduce classroom and residence hall occupancies, thereby allowing a residential experience for many students.</p>
<p>But in recent weeks, with cases rising, concerns have grown increasingly visible, not only among students but faculty worried about contracting the virus or spreading ot to a vulnerable household member. In a survey released last week, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/07/15/State-System-Higher-Education-instructors-APSCUF-union-survey-unsafe-classroom-return-Jamie-Martin/stories/202007150019" target="_blank">70% of State System faculty</a> said they did not feel in-person instruction was safe.</p>
<p>Penn State University leaders received a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/06/16/Penn-State-University-fall-classes-COVID-19-academic-freedom-petition-Townsend-Berube-Barron/stories/202006160077" target="_blank">letter of concern</a> from their faculty, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/07/10/International-students-ICE-immigration-Pitt-COVID-19-faculty-open-letter-university-deport/stories/202007100112" target="_blank">as did the University off Pittsburgh</a>.</p>
<p>The Pitt News, the student newspaper at Pitt, criticized leaders’ plans to quarantine newly arriving students without a provision to penalize them if they do not follow it. <a href="https://pittnews.com/article/158960/opinions/editorial-pitts-required-shelter-in-place-is-delusional/" target="_blank">An editorial called it&nbsp;“delusional”</a> and urged the university to rethink its mix of in-person and remove learning, taking the fall semester instead online.</p>
