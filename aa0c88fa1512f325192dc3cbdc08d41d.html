<h1>Meghan returns to Canada; Prince Harry in 'crisis' talks with Prince Charles</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>LONDON — Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has flown back to Canada following the bombshell announcement that she and her husband, Prince Harry, are stepping back from royal duties, prompting renewed speculation that the couple will make Canada their part-time home.</p>
<p>An official at Buckingham Palace confirmed reports that Meghan has returned to Canada.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Prince Harry has stayed in Britain, where he is reportedly in deep discussions with his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II; his father, Prince Charles; and his brother, Prince William about the couple’s future role.</p>
<p>Or, as the Daily Mail put it: “Queen’s crisis talks with Harry: Duke of Sussex has been locked in four-way call with Her Majesty in Sandringham and Prince Charles in Scotland as they try to avert all out royal war.”</p>
<p>Harry and Meghan took the palace by surprise with their decision to step back from royal duties. There is speculation that the couple rushed to issue the statement after the Sun tabloid published a front-page story on Wednesday that claimed the couple were looking to move to Canada for a “significant portion of this year.”</p>
<p>They attempted to explain how they see their role on their flashy <a href="https://sussexroyal.com/" target="_blank">new website, SussexRoyal.com</a>, launched on Wednesday. They said they wanted to continue to work with their charities, which focus on issues such as female empowerment and mental health, and would also seek to set up a new charitable entity. The Sussexes said they would like to achieve “financial independence,” and while in the United Kingdom, they plan to live at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.</p>
<p>But there are more questions than answers. How will they earn money? How will they continue to work with U.K.-based charities when abroad? What kind of funding will they receive from Prince Charles, who reportedly was not informed about their decision but pays for 95 percent of their expenses via his Duchy of Cornwall estate? Where will they live in North America?</p>
<p>On the last point, they could move to Los Angeles, where Meghan was raised and where her mother lives. But current speculation is that the couple will take up part-time residence in Canada, perhaps in Toronto, where Meghan, then an actress, lived for more than six years while shooting the legal drama “Suits.” They also spent at least part of their six-week Christmas vacation in British Columbia in western Canada, where they were spotted jogging and hiking around Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>Eagle-eyed royal watchers have also noticed that the couple’s new website was designed by the same Toronto-based web designers who did The Tig, Meghan’s now-shuttered lifestyle blog.</p>
<p>Canada is a member of the British Commonwealth. Even though Prince Harry’s grandmother is the head of state - he will see Queen Elizabeth’s face every time he uses Canadian money - that doesn’t mean that Harry is an automatic Canadian citizen. As a British citizen, Harry can stay in Canada for up to six months at a time without a visa. The couple could also apply for work visas.</p>
<p>The day before they announced they would be stepping back from public duties, Harry and Meghan visited Canada House in London’s Trafalgar square to thank the assembled diplomats for the hospitality they received. Meghan said the family had an “incredible time.” “To see Archie go ‘ah’ when you walk by, and just see how stunning it is - so it meant a lot to us,” she said.</p>
<p>Jessica Mulroney, a Toronto-based stylist and close friend of Meghan’s, posted a quote on Instagram on Thursday, attributed to the filmmaker and singer Gina Carey: “A strong woman looks a challenge in the eye and gives it a wink.”</p>
