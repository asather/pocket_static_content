<p>The organizers of the Pittsburgh Blues &amp; Roots Festival have decided that the July event will not happen after all.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, the festival, which benefits Band Together Pittsburgh and the Autism Society of Pittsburgh, sent out a tweet that it was&nbsp;“still a go” for July 25-26 with headliners including Anthony Gomes and Watermelon Slim.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, organizers John Vento and Ron "Moondog" Esser issued this statement:</p>
<p>“Earlier today...an inadvertent tweet went out stating that the 2020 Pittsburgh Blues &amp; Roots Festival would forge ahead as scheduled. Our friend Scott Mervis of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published a wonderful article in an effort to support this event. This would have been the 4th year for the concert which supports folks on the autism spectrum through the great work of Band Together Pittsburgh and The Autism Society of Pittsburgh. It also featured many performers on the spectrum, proving how talented and gifted ‘differently abled’ people are!</p>
<p>“Though we were hoping against hope to proceed with the 2020 festival, the overwhelming response to the Post-Gazette article has been so negative that we have no choice but to cancel the event now. We understand and appreciate the concerns of many and respect every person’s right to speak out regardless of their position. Additionally, there are still too many unknowns as it relates to the state’s upcoming guidelines for public gatherings.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, for Band Together Pittsburgh the festival is our largest fundraiser and we will certainly feel the financial pinch as many other organizations have. We offer a wide variety of music programs (open mic performances, DJ training, drum circles, etc.) in support of those on the spectrum. As a matter of fact you can check out our most recent “Virtual Autism Friendly Open Mic” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1qHTUsW-FE&amp;t=1821s" target="_blank">here</a>.”</p>
<p>Allegheny County is currently in the “yellow” phase, which prohibits gatherings of more than 25 people, although it has allowed drive-ins to open.</p>
<p>The county would have to be in the “green” phase for the Blues &amp; Roots Festival, which evolved from the Pittsburgh Blues Festival at Hartwood Acres, to take place.</p>
<p>In March, Vento and Esser (of the Blawnox club Moondog’s) were 2020 Communitas Awards Excellence Winners for their work with Band Together Pittsburgh, a community-based nonprofit that uses the power of music to enrich the lives of individuals on the autism spectrum and their families.</p>
