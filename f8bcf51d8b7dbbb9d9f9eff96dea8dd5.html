<h1>Pirates' Nick Burdi leading blood donation movement via social media</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For someone whose fastball routinely flirts with triple-digits, it’s ironic that Nick Burdi never saw this coming.</p>
<p>Sure, the Pirates reliever thought a few of his teammates might donate blood, too. There might even be a small bump on social media. But having 116,000 views on a Twitter post in a matter of hours? Yeah, no way Burdi was counting on that.</p>
<p>“I guess it’s something to be thankful for. In our country right now, people are very aware of [COVID-19] and how severe of a threat it is to the community,” Burdi said by phone on Thursday night. “Hopefully this spreads some awareness and people understand how severe the situation is that we’re in right now.”</p>
<p>With the help of the Pirates, his agency and some friends around baseball, Burdi said he’s more than happy to draw attention to an important issue by posting about his own experience donating blood and urging others to do the same.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/17/817249320/social-distancing-leads-to-blood-shortage" target="_blank">an NPR story</a> posted on Tuesday afternoon, the American Red Cross was facing a “severe blood shortage” because roughly 2,700 blood drives had been canceled due to concerns over social distancing. That resulted in approximately 86,000 fewer blood donations, NPR’s Jeff Brady wrote.</p>
<p>Burdi hopes to change that. He was sitting at home with his wife, Rebecca, on Thursday afternoon and heard U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams talk about the need for blood donations. An emergency room nurse who’s studying to become a nurse practitioner, Rebecca Burdi asked her husband if he’d be willing to donate blood.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘Yeah, why not?’” Nick said.</p>
<p>So Jessica made Nick an appointment. An hour later, they were driving together to the donation center when Nick started texting a few of his Pirates teammates, asking if they’d donate as well.</p>
<p>“A lot of guys said they’d be more than happy to,” Nick Burdi said.</p>
<p>After filling out some paperwork, Burdi donated, hung around for an extra 10-15 minutes to make sure everything was OK and then went home and started a hashtag: #MLBbloodDonationChallenge. He tagged teammates Joe Musgrove, Derek Holland and Steven Brault, challenging them to donate. Burdi said he picked those guys because they’ve either played for other teams or have large followings.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping it all takes off, and we can get this thing up and running,” Burdi said.</p>
<p>Later, Burdi’s agents contacted Pete Alonso of the Mets and Will Smith of the Dodgers — young, prominent players on big-market clubs. Burdi has spent the time since donating direct messaging and texting other friends around baseball, exhorting them to donate.</p>
<p>“It’s moving in the right direction so far, and it’s picking up some steam,” Burdi said. “We’re hoping maybe in the next three-five days that it gets going.”</p>
<p>Burdi credited Jessica for most of the work on this.</p>
<p>“She’s been the corporate leader,” he said. But Nick Burdi is also counting on the baseball community to get behind this and help rectify the current blood shortage.</p>
<p>As for baseball, Burdi said he took the week off from throwing. He’s worried about potentially playing weekly doubleheaders or a back-loaded season that stretches into October or November, so he’s taking it easy now.</p>
<p>“Just trying to have a de-load week and then pick up throwing starting Monday,” Burdi said. “Still working out. Still staying in shape.</p>
<p>“We have a bike here. We feel that it’s important to practice social distancing right now to keep everyone safe throughout the city and community.”</p>
<p>And, of course, focus on rounding up potential blood donors.</p>
<p>“I was expecting to have some people reach out, retweet, repost or whatever,” Burdi said. “I definitely wasn’t expecting it to take off this quickly.”</p>
