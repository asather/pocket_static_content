<h1>Gerry Dulac's Top 5 Masters: Tiger Woods' first win meaningful on many levels</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette golf writer Gerry Dulac has covered 27 Masters, including the past 22 in a row, and would have been at the Augusta National Golf Club this week if the first major of the season wasn’t postponed until November. This week, he’ll rank the Top 5 Masters tournaments in his professional lifetime.</em></p>
<p>For nine holes, it was just another opening-round Thursday at the Masters. Then, when a 21-year-old wunderkind named Tiger Woods headed to Amen Corner, the golf world changed forever.</p>
<p>When Woods blew away the field at the 1997 Masters by a record 12 shots with a tournament-record score of 18-under 270 — becoming the youngest winner in tournament history — it did more than mark the beginning of a period of golfing brilliance and domination that might never be equaled again.</p>
<p>It changed nearly everything about the game — the way it was perceived by the public, the manner in which PGA Tour players had to be prepare, the size of the television contracts and the money being paid to the players. But, more significantly, an athlete of Thai, Chinese, Native American and African-American descent had single-handedly eradicated a racial barrier that permeated a sport long considered to be played by mostly all white people.</p>
<p>And he did it in his first major appearance as a professional and at a place that never had a black player in the field until Lee Elder in 1975.</p>
<p>It became cool to play golf. It was cool to be like Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>“The 1997 Masters wasn’t so much a ‘Hello world’ moment,” former world No. 1 David Duval said on the Golf Channel. “It was more like, ‘Watch out, world.’ ”</p>
<p>It all came to pass that April weekend at Augusta National Golf Club, making what Woods did 23 years ago one of the most significant moments in the history of sports, not just golf.</p>
<p>“The story was so big it transcended the sport,” said Jim Nantz, who has broadcast every Masters for CBS Sports since 1986. “It became a news story to see Tiger win the Masters that year. The growth of the game came as a direct result of that performance in ’97.”</p>

<p>Woods shot a 4-over 40 on the opening nine, paired with defending champ Nick Faldo, a three-time winner of the green jacket. . Then he shot 30 on the back, pitching in for birdie at the par-3 12th and making eagle at the par-5 15th, and golf was never the same. Ever.</p>
<p>He followed that with rounds of 66, 65 and 69, posting a record score and obliterating a field that really didn’t know what hit them. The next closest player was Tom Kite … 12 shots behind. Everybody knew Woods was a prodigy — he had already won three PGA Tour events in 14 starts coming into the Masters — and even Arnold Palmer said before the tournament, “I don’t think there is anything to stop him from winning right here or anywhere else.” But this?</p>
<p>Colin Montgomerie, one of the top players in the world, was paired with Woods on Saturday when he shot 65 in the third round — “The easiest 65 I’ve ever seen,” he called it — and couldn’t believe what he was witnessing.</p>
<p>“From the second hole on,” Montgomerie said, “I thought, ‘Hang on a minute. This is something extraordinary.’ ”</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>Faldo, who was ranked eighth in the world at the time and coming off a victory six weeks earlier at Riviera, said the attention being heaped on Woods was almost intolerable.</p>
<p>“To be honest, it was annoying,” said Faldo, a six-time major winner who was accustomed to media scrutiny in his native England. “The attention was unbelievable. No player before had ever walked to the first tee with eight policemen around him to lead him to the tee. It was a whole different aura around him. It was amazing.”</p>
<p>Still, nobody could have realistically comprehended what Woods would accomplish after that incredible moment.</p>
<p>What he did for those final 63 holes changed the game. And changed a generation. Many of the best players around the world today remember the 1997 Masters as the moment of inspiration for their careers.</p>
<p>“I was 9 at the time, sitting there, watching that, was why I got into golf a lot more,” said Jason Day, a former world No. 1 player and PGA champion. “I’m not the only one who grew up idolizing Tiger and watching him in ’97.”</p>
<p>The 1997 Masters changed everything about the game. All because of Tiger Woods.</p>
