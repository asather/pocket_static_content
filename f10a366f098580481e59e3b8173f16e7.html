<h1>Kennedy's Ashley Marina ready to face the unknown in 'America's Got Talent'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There are plenty of 12-year-olds out there who write songs, which makes Ashley Marina all the more special — how many of them get to sing one on national television?</p>
<p>The rising eighth-grader at Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School in Midland, Beaver County, was in the spotlight last week on NBC’s “America’s Got Talent.”</p>
<p>She made it to the next round, but it wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>“Usually when I perform I get more nervous in front of smaller audiences,” said Ashley, who is enjoying summer break at home in Kennedy Township. “With a bigger audience, I’m less nervous.”</p>
<p>Yet this was one of the summer’s most reliable ratings staples, a show that features acts that range from stunning to outright bizarre. This was performing not only on television with its bright lights and a live audience, but in front of a judges panel of Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, Sofia Vergara and Simon Cowell, the last of whom has been known to make singers cry with his evaluations.</p>
<p>This was no national anthem gig at a Pirates game, which she has done (although Ashley noted they are, vocally, “very hard. It takes a lot of tries to get it to go the way you want it to go.”)</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, she flew to Los Angeles with her family to audition. Her mother, Nina Yankello, helped with hair and makeup in their hotel room, then it was off to the theater.</p>
<p>“Marina” is Ashley’s middle name. A combination of parents’ Mark and Nina’s names, it seemed easier to use on stage than Yankello.</p>
<p>Literally in the spotlight to perform at the audition, Ashley would sing two songs by popular artists&nbsp;— “Anyway” and “Opportunity”&nbsp;— but was stopped by Cowell.</p>
<p>He said he felt they were wrong for her voice and wanted something else. What followed on the broadcast was a bit confusing: Cowell asked her to return later and sing something written for a boy’s voice.</p>
<p>“They did not show this on TV but I was talking about how, when I was younger, I used to love Justin Bieber. So they said ‘come back later and sing a song by Justin Bieber, or a song by a guy.’”</p>
<p>She just wasn’t comfortable with the song choices. Instead, she asked to do one of her own compositions. “You’ll Always Be My Hero” is a tribute to her father, Mark, that she wrote 18 months ago.</p>
<p>By the time she returned to the stage, Klum was missing due to illness. She missed what appeared to be an emotional slam-dunk, with all three judges effusive in their praise. Her audition has been viewed more than 11 million times on YouTube.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time Ashley had written a song for a relative. When an uncle in Venezuela had a heart operation, she wrote one called “Move a Mountain.”</p>
<p>The coming months will allow her to do the kinds of stuff kids get to do: riding bikes with friends, learning to skateboard, hanging out with family. There will be more music, of course.</p>
<p>Not only does she play the piano, but guitar and ukulele as well. And she dances a bit. Funnily, she said her brother, Roman, and her parents are not musically inclined.</p>
<p>“Maybe some long-distance cousins…?” she said, giggling.</p>
<p>She is contractually forbidden to talk about what kind of music she will perform in the next round. Ashley will likely return to sing in a pre-taped show this summer.</p>
<p>If she is sent through, the next challenge would be a live broadcast. The program is expected to transition to live shows in August, but the specifics have not been announced.</p>
<p>Other programs, including ABC’s “American Idol” and NBC’s “The Voice,” have gone live with singers in studios, but the nature of “AGT” acts&nbsp;— some of which involve fire, arrows, or both —would prohibit easy translation off-site.</p>

<p>Ashley said after the show, which aired Jun 15, she received “lots of wonderful comments” via social media. “It was amazing to see how they connected to something I wrote and a lot of people said they cried during my performance.</p>
<p>“They were really connecting to the lyrics.”</p>
