<h1>PennDOT begins plans to upgrade Thornburg Bridge between Crafton and Thornburg </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is developing plans for a major rehabilitation of the Thornburg Bridge that crosses Chartiers Creek on Route 60 between Crafton and Thornburg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project, which is in its developmental stages now, is scheduled to begin in 2022, but it is being handled differently than most projects. Instead of holding a public meeting to outline the project, PennDOT has posted a slideshow on its <a title="PennDOT website" href="https://www.penndot.gov/RegionalOffices/district-11/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">website </a>that includes a survey for residents to provide their ideas and concerns about the project.</p>
<p>The project will include painting the bridge, replacing its deck and upgrading the substructure and superstructure. The deck on the six-span, multi-girder steel bridge will be removed using a high-pressure water system and replaced with latex-modified concrete.</p>
<p>In addition, Route 60 will be upgraded from Cornell Avenue to Woodmere Drive, a distance of 1,240 feet. The road work also will include drainage work, guide rail improvements, new signs and pavement markings, and a new traffic signal on the Crafton end.</p>
<p>Current plans call for maintaining traffic in one lane in each direction during daylight hours with the option of reducing to one alternating lane from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. If there is no nighttime work, there will be no traffic restrictions.</p>
<p>The bridge could be closed for two or three weekends for removing the deck and laying down the new pavement. Sidewalks will be open for most of the work, but shuttles will be available for pedestrians when they are closed.</p>
<p>The bridge, built in 1980, carries an average of 17,670 vehicles daily.</p>
