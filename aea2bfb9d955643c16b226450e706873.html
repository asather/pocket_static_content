<h1>Pitt's Dane Jackson hoping to build on standout Senior Bowl at this weekend's NFL combine</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dane Jackson spent the last month in Pensacola, Fla., which must have been nice.</p>
<p>But Pitt's top NFL draft prospect wasn't casually soaking in the sun 1,000 miles south.&nbsp;For the last four weeks, Jackson's schedule was airtight as he prepared for what lies ahead this weekend at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis.</p>
<p>Monday through Friday, Jackson ate breakfast at 9 a.m. He trained at EXOS, a high-end performance complex on the Gulf of Mexico, from 10 a.m. to noon, mixing in upper body, lower body and speed work (40-yard dash, 20-yard shuttle, cone drills, etc.). That was followed by a second session at 3:30 p.m. every day, in addition to lunchtime position drills on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Oh, and there was a Saturday session, too, for good measure.</p>
<p>All of that to shave off a tenth of a second here, a tenth there on his speed drills. All of that to be prepared for the biggest showcase of collegiate talent in front of a host of NFL coaches, executives and scouts. All of that to push his trending stock a little higher.</p>
<p>“I'm trying to go out there and show what I can do,” Jackson told the Post-Gazette last week, on the phone from Pensacola. “In every area and in every drill.”</p>
<p>Jackson's opportunity will come Sunday, when defensive backs close out the combine with on-field workouts from 2-7 p.m, airing on NFL Network. There, at Lucas Oil Stadium, the Coraopolis native and former Quaker Valley star hopes to build on his Senior Bowl showing.</p>
<p>In late January, Jackson — who earned 41 starts and recorded 43 passes defended at Pitt — was one of four former Panthers to compete in senior showcases. Maurice Ffrench traveled to the Hula Bowl in Hawaii; Clairton product Aaron Mathews and Nakia Griffin-Stewart played in the Tropical Bowl in Daytona Beach, Fla.; and Jackson shot down to Mobile, Ala., where the football world descended upon Ladd-Peebles Stadium.</p>
<p>In three days of practice, Jackson's press man prowess commanded attention. CBSSports reporter Chris Trapasso dubbed him “the most disruptive corner of the week,” and Senior Bowl executive director Jim Nagy announced that Jackson was one of the South team's players of the week. That was voted on by the opposing position group, a telling reflection of the impression he left in Mobile.</p>
<p>“I thought overall it was a great experience. Just being around those guys who come from all across the country, all the top players, I mean, it's considered one of the best bowl games,” Jackson said. “Coming from Pitt, not many guys get to play in the Senior Bowl. Putting on for my family, the city of Pittsburgh and everyone who supports me, I appreciate all the support. I appreciate all the love.”</p>
<p>Jackson also mentioned that it was beneficial to speak with scouts face-to-face at the Senior Bowl. The 6-foot defensive back said he's communicated with all 32 teams by now and one specific squad doesn't stand out as an obvious suitor. But any team with a need at corner could certainly do worse than Jackson, especially considering where he stands with the draft less than two months away.</p>
<p>Despite the Senior Bowl buzz, Jackson still projects as a Day 3 draft selection. The draft-eligible corner who allowed the fewest receiving yards per game in 2019, per Sports Info Solutions, ranks 16th at his position and 139th overall on CBS Sports' big board.</p>
<p>Now, obviously that can change if he lights it up in Indy.</p>
<p>Jackson has a solid understanding of what to expect this weekend. The corner, who shares an agent with former Pitt teammate Avonte Maddox, consulted Maddox about what to expect from the combine experience, which entails not only workouts but also a ringer of interviews with NFL personnel. Jackson also sought the advice of Quadree Henderson and Jordan Whitehead, who attended the 2018 combine.</p>
<p>With that knowledge and the training at EXOS, where he competed one-on-one with speedy wide receivers like Kentucky's Lynn Bowden and Penn State's KJ Hamler, Jackson feels prepared for Indianapolis. Even if it took a little bit to get comfortable with the technique that comes with the combine's in-a-vacuum drills.</p>
<p>“It's not really weird to adjust to. It's just that we never really do it,” Jackson said with a laugh. “You never line straight up and sprint [in a game].”</p>
<p>But on Sunday, that's the game he'll play. And if his stringent schedule at EXOS pays off, Jackson is a candidate to emerge next week as a draft board riser.</p>
