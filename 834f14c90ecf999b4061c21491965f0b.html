<h1>Police seeking Glen Hazel man for shooting in Fineview</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh police have obtained a warrant for a Glen Hazel man wanted in a shooting incident in Fineview on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Police filed eight charges, including two counts each of aggravated assault and simple assault, against 21-year-old Raequon Williamson. They say he shot an unidentified person in the arm about 8:30 a.m. Friday after a domestic dispute.</p>
<p>Police said they initially responded to a domestic dispute in the 1800 block of Belleau Street and took a report from a victim who said Mr. Williamson had been at the residence about 7:15 a.m. and left. After police left, the victim’s cousin went to the residence to provide comfort and Mr. Williamson returned.</p>
<p>The cousin convinced Mr. Williamson to leave, police said, then went outside to make sure he left. That’s when the victim said Mr. Williamson rolled down the window of the black SUV he was driving and shot the victim.</p>
<p>ShotSpotter reported six shots were fired in the area at that time, authorities said. The victim initially was hospitalized in stable condition.</p>
<p>Police filed charges against Mr. Williamson for the initial incident and the shooting, but he hasn’t been apprehended. Mr. Williamson had been arrested June 2 in another domestic incident involving the same person, police said.&nbsp;</p>
