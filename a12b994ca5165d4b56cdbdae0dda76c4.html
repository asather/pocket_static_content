<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Robert Full, Allegheny County’s former longtime chief of emergency services and fire marshal, a lifelong volunteer firefighter, and a friendly public servant known for his work ethic, compassion and accessibility, has died.</p>
<p>His death Friday was announced Saturday morning by the county. He was 65 and lived in Swisshelm Park.</p>
<p>Mr. Full’s career in emergency services began in Forest Hills, where he joined the volunteer ambulance and rescue service, and then <a href="http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20000814newsmaker2.asp" target="_blank">spanned the city of Pittsburgh</a>, the county and the state, where he worked for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency as chief deputy director.</p>
<p>With his death, Allegheny County has lost two towering figures in emergency management in 2020 — Mr. Full and his longtime associate, Glenn Cannon, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2020/01/20/Glenn-Cannon-obituary-pittsburgh-public-safety-director-ems-pema-allegheny-county/stories/202001200072" target="_blank">who died in January</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Cannon, who went on to run PEMA, was the Allegheny County manager when he recruited Mr. Full for two years before finally convincing him to leave Pittsburgh in 1998, where he was an assistant chief of emergency services.</p>
<p>“Chief Full was a true public servant who dedicated his life to public safety and the protection of the community he called home, and the people he called friends and neighbors. We were fortunate that Allegheny County was that place,” County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said in a statement.</p>
<p>“During his tenure with the county, Chief Full’s leadership was instrumental in the consolidation of the many public safety answering points throughout the county. His work led to the creation of the Allegheny County 911 Center, the state-of-the-art facility that millions of people rely on today. His leadership moved this region forward at a critical time.”</p>
<p>Mr. Full is survived by his wife, Geri, two children and three grandchildren.</p>
<p>Funeral arrangements are pending.</p>
