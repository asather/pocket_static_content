<h1>High school girls basketball rankings: Plum moves in, West Greene moves up</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kennedie Montue is scoring lots of points for the Plum girls basketball team – and it’s one of the main reasons Plum is winning a lot more than usual.</p>
<p>Montue is the third-leading scorer in the WPIAL, entering this week with a 22.7 average. She has led Plum to a 10-4 overall record, a 6-1 mark in WPIAL Class 5A Section 2 and a spot in the Post-Gazette rankings for the first time this season. Plum is the No. 5 team in Class 5A in this week’s rankings.</p>
<p>Plum hasn’t finished with a record above .500 since the 2014-15 season when the Mustangs were 12-11. Plum also is in good position to win a section title. The Mustangs have a big home game Friday night against Mars (11-4, 5-3).</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the rankings, West Greene has moved up to the No. 2 spot in Class 1A. West Greene was No. 3 last week, but moved up after previously No. 2-ranked Vincentian lost last week to Our Lady of the Sacred Heart.</p>
<p>West Greene was a WPIAL finalist the past two seasons and lost a number of top players to graduation. But West Greene is still flourishing. The Pioneers are 16-0 and one of only four teams in the WPIAL with an undefeated record. West Greene has been led in scoring by Jersey Wise, who averages 16 points a game.</p>
