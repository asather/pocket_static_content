<h1>As schools near Philadelphia close because of COVID-19, districts in Western Pa. prepare for disease's 'eventual arrival'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the first time since the coronavirus outbreak began, several schools in Pennsylvania have been closed after students were exposed to a person from another state with a confirmed case.</p>
<p>All five of the schools that were shut down were in the Central Bucks School District close to Philadelphia, but districts on the western side of the state are preparing for the arrival of the virus in the region.</p>
<p>“We understand the news of the coronavirus is unsettling and want to assure you that we are proactively working with the Allegheny County Health Department about the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and developing an action plan, should the coronavirus impact our area,” Pittsburgh Public Schools Superintendent Anthony Hamlet wrote in a letter sent to parents last week.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamlet advised parents not to send their children to school if they believe may sick.</p>
<p>He recommended that parents take several steps to protect themselves and their children from the virus, including following a pediatrician's orders, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands frequently, getting a flu vaccination and disinfecting often-touched objects and surfaces.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools was just one of several local school districts that sent a letter home to parents as preparations are made for the impact of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Beaver Area School District Superintendent Carrie Rowe said in a letter sent to parents on Wednesday that the district is preparing for COVID-19’s "eventual arrival in our region."</p>
<p>Ms. Rowe said that the Beaver Area School District was already reviewing and updating phases of a readiness plan.</p>
<p>Custodial staff was spending "extra time cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces daily," Ms. Rowe said.</p>
<p>"We are using this time to ensure that we have sufficient stock of recommended cleaning supplies, including disinfectant and protective solutions for use in our Bactronix electrostatic delivery system and antibacterial cleansers for everyday use," Ms. Rowe said in a statement.</p>
<p>Officials from the Penn-Trafford School District urged parents to follow advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Maintenance staff continues to clean student desks daily in “every classroom,” Penn-Trafford School District officials said in a statement. The staff uses disinfectant wipes on a daily basis for each computers, laptops and IPads in the district.</p>
<p>"We will continue to work in close collaboration with local health officials and seek specific guidance from local health officials to determine what steps are necessary if a local outbreak situation evolves," district officials said.</p>
<p>Some school administrators tried to alleviate fears of the virus, such as Washington School District Superintendent James Konrad, who said in a statement that there have only been a small number of confirmed cases of the virus in the United States.</p>
<p>In Eastern Pennsylvania, the Central Bucks School District superintendent said the decision to close the schools is “out of an abundance of caution” after local and state health officials informed him Thursday night that district community members were exposed to a confirmed case of the virus that originated in another state.</p>
<p>The schools will be deep-cleaned during the closure, Superintendent John J. Kopicki wrote in an email sent to parents. The affected schools in the district are in Warrington, Chalfont and Doylestown.</p>
<p>The Bucks County Health Department is currently evaluating these individuals to determine when they may return to school, the email said.</p>
