<h1>Westmoreland, Fayette doctor charged in pills-for-sex scheme indicted again on new charges</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Emilio Navarro, a family practice doctor in Westmoreland and Fayette counties, has been indicted a second time in a pills-for-sex scheme.</p>
<p>Federal agents arrested him Friday morning and brought him to U.S. District Court for an initial hearing.</p>
<p>Dr. Navarro, who practiced in Mount Pleasant and Perryopolis, was already under indictment for prescribing pain pills to a woman in 2018 and last year in exchange for sex. He had surrendered his medical license as a condition of his release on bond in September.</p>
<p>A federal magistrate judge at that time also ordered that all of his guns be turned over to agents, who found four firearms at his Perryopolis office.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment against him on Tuesday charging him with similar conduct involving a second woman.</p>
<p>The charges said that starting in April of 2015 until his arrest last year, he prescribed oxycodone and similar narcotics to a person identified as "Victim 2" outside the normal scope of medical practice. He also prescribed her alprazolam, an anti-anxiety&nbsp;medication.</p>
<p>In the initial charges, he was accused of 28 counts of illegally prescribing oxycodone and oxymorphone to someone identified as "A.W." in exchange for sex.</p>
<p>He was also charged with a count of healthcare fraud because Medicaid paid for the prescriptions.</p>
<p>The new charges bring the count total to 161, which includes two new charges of healthcare fraud for allegedly ripping off Medicaid and Highmark in connection with prescriptions for the second victim.</p>
<p>Dr. Navarro appeared briefly Friday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Maureen Kelly. Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Cessar, who heads a federal unit that pursues bad doctors across the region, asked that Dr. Navarro be detained, but the judge allowed him to go free pending a detention hearing next month.</p>
<p>In addition to surrendering his medical license and his guns, Dr. Navarro has surrendered his U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration registration and his prescription pads.</p>
