<h1>Fishing Report: Fly tied to benefit children with a rare disease</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A fly tied to raise funding for children with a rare disease made the day for one Pittsburgh angler.</p>
<p>Morning temperatures hovered around 20 degrees when Nico Summaria of Peters caught the day’s first steelhead on a Lake Erie tributary. When the sun rose above the treeline, he moved to Walnut Creek and landed two more with the Love for Leighton Pheasant Tail benefit fly.</p>
<p>“All fish were caught on a two-fly nymph rig using a pink Nuke Egg and a size 14 Love for Leighton Pheasant Tail nymph,” said Mr. Summaria. “Not a bad day for sub-freezing temperatures and iced up streams for most of the day.”</p>
<p>The fly named for Leighton Meister is a beaded nymph with hot pink legs tied by Pennsylvania-based Lively Legz Fly Fishing ($1.50 each at <a href="/livelylegz.com" target="_blank">livelylegz.com</a>). A portion of the proceeds benefit children afflicted with Infantile Batten’s disease, a rare neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no cure.

<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County)</p>
<p>Monday’s rain brought good flow, fresh fish and better stream fishing. Catches were reported at Twentymile and Sixteenmile creeks in the east, and on Elk, Walnut and Crooked creeks west of the peninsula. By Tuesday, waters were high and muddy but steelhead trout and a few browns were taken on brightly colored egg sacs. Cloud cover was expected through the weekend with Sunday temperatures approaching 40 degrees.</p>
<p>Steelheaders were concerned when they couldn’t find Elk Creek on the popular live-streaming web camera operated by Uncle John’s Elk Creek Campground, located near the mouth off Old Lake Road. The creek and campground are still there, just a few technical changes including an updated four-camera system and access at <a href="/unclejohnselkcreekcamp.com" target="_blank">unclejohnselkcreekcamp.com</a>.

<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Venango County) Anglers picked up walleye, muskellunge and a few Northern pike.</p>
<p><strong>Kahle Lake</strong> (Venango County) Ice was iffy, but anglers caught yellow perch, crappies and bluegill.</p>
<p><strong>Bradys Run Lake</strong> (Beaver County) Shore anglers took advantage of a good trout bite. The hot bait was live minnows.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio, Beaver rivers</strong> (Beaver County) Walleye were taken below the dams.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Creek Lake</strong> (Indiana County) Northern pike went for shiners near the Day Use area and North Shore launch.</p>
<p><strong>Cummings Reservoir</strong> (Indiana County) Live minnows and wax worms attracted brook trout.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Arthur</strong> (Butler County) Skim ice surrounded most shorelines, but open water at the dam outflow created shore-fishing opportunity on Muddy Creek. The state Fish and Boat Commission recommended light-colored tube baits for walleye and muskellunge.</p>
<p><strong>Quemahoning Reservoir</strong> (Somerset County) It’s too soon for spawning runs, but a few Northerns were taken in the shallows near the Quemahoning Street Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>Youghiogheny River</strong> (Somerset, Fayette counties) When flow conditions were optimal, rainbows were taken at the tailrace.</p>
