<p>Roberto Clemente Jr. wanted to spend more time around the Pirates this season. Excited by new manager Derek Shelton and the direction he thinks the Pirates are headed, one of the iconic right fielder’s sons looked forward to meeting some new people and learning more about the ones he already knew.</p>
<p>“COVID put a stop to that one,” Clemente Jr. said by phone on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>While Clemente Jr. hasn’t been able to spend as much time around the team as he might’ve liked, he feels like he already has a solid opinion formed on Josh Bell, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/09/03/pirates-josh-bell-roberto-clemente/stories/202009030155" target="_blank">the Pirates’ nominee</a> for the Roberto Clemente Award, which is given out every year to celebrate players’ impact outside of baseball.</p>
<p>Clemente Jr.’s feelings on Bell, of course, are tremendously positive.</p>
<p>“He’s so humble and such a good person,” Clemente Jr. said. “You can’t pretend to be a good person. You either are or you aren’t, and he’s just a really good person.”</p>
<p>Bell has always been active in the community but this year adjusted his platform to help push forward a necessary national conversation on eradicating systemic racism and fighting for social justice.</p>
<p>The first baseman <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/08/28/pirates-josh-bell-jackie-robinson-jacob-blake-shooting/stories/202008280145" target="_blank">has talked a few times this season</a> about striving for better police accountability, Colin Kaepernick’s situation and the need for society to change in order to create a better world for generations to come.</p>
<p>After learning that Bell would represent the Pirates, Clemente Jr. also had a couple of important words for Bell as they relate to Roberto Clemente’s enduring legacy.</p>
<p>“I told him, ‘You carry a big stick. Now you have a big responsibility.’ ” Roberto Jr. said. “Obviously it’s good to see a guy like him representing the team off the field. I’m very proud that it’s him. Great congratulations and hopefully good luck to be able to win the big one.”</p>
<p>The Pirates will honor Roberto Clemente by wearing No. 21 as a team on Wednesday against the White Sox. All Puerto Rico natives in MLB <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/09/08/roberto-clemente-day-mlb-puerto-rican-players-pittsburgh-pirates/stories/202009080081" target="_blank">will receive the same privilege</a>, which thrills Roberto Jr.</p>
<p>The same as Bell pushing his message forward, Roberto Jr. hopes this not only honors his late father but also helps society take some important steps toward unity and understanding.</p>
<p>“We’re very proud,” Roberto Jr. said. “The number represents our identity, our Puerto Rican identity. The guys are very excited. The people in Puerto Rico right now are really so pumped up, excited and proud that this is happening.</p>
<p>“This is a great start to unify everyone and be able to live for humanity and do the best for humanity.”</p>
<p>The Pirates will also honor Roberto’s late wife, Vera, with a moment of silence before Wednesday’s game. Vera Clemente, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/11/16/Vera-Clemente-Roberto-s-widow-dies/stories/201911160063" target="_blank">who died Nov. 19, 2019</a>, was incredibly active with charity work and honoring Roberto’s legacy.&nbsp;This will be the first Clemente Day without the matriarch of the family, and it’s sure to be a little extra emotional because of it.</p>
<p>“Everything has been different since she passed,” Roberto Jr. said. “That was the day I was dreading all of my life.</p>
<p>“Not having her for the first time around the landmarks and holidays that are going to be coming up is going to be pretty tough, but to be able to celebrate her life knowing where she’s at, with dad, and our Lord Jesus Christ, I’m happy.</p>
<p>“We can still feel all she did here coming together in a really, really special way. It can only come from above.”</p>
