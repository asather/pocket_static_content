<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Woodland Hills quarterback Deontae Williams put on a one-man show, as he racked up 183 of the Wolverines’ 261 yards of offense in a 26-7 victory against Penn Hills.</p>
<p>Williams ran for 104 yards and two touchdowns while completing 5 of 7 passes for another 79 yards and a score for the Wolverines (2-0) in the non-conference clash.</p>
<p>Derrick Topeck of Penn Hills (0-2) carried the ball 13 times for 129 yards and a touchdown in the second quarter. The Wolverines defense wreaked havoc on quarterback Julian Dugger, who was held to 8 completions on 21 attempts and was picked off twice.</p>
<p>It was the 30th meeting between the two teams. Woodland Hills holds an 18-12 edge in the series.</p>
<p><strong>Other games</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gateway 55, Bethel Park 14:</strong> Derrick Davis of No. 2-ranked Gateway (2-0) scored nearly half the time he carried the ball in a non-conference rout of the Black Hawks (0-2).

Carsen Engleka connected on 19 of 25 passes for 240 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions. Patrick Body snagged seven receptions that covered 126 yards and he found the end zone twice.</p>
<p><strong>Franklin Regional 42, Fox Chapel 20:</strong> Trevor Brncic accounted for four touchdowns to lead the charge for the Panthers (1-1), who bounced back from a 41-7 loss to Gateway a week ago. The Foxes (0-2) have been outscored, 95-27, so far this season.</p>
<p><strong>Moon 17, North Hills 0:</strong> Dylan Sleva ran for just 24 yards on five carries, but his two touchdown runs carried the Tigers to a non-conference win.

Dawson Snyder hauled in seven passes for 115 yards.</p>
<p><strong>Latrobe 35, Mount Pleasant 7:</strong> The Wildcats (1-1) earned the non-conference win thanks to two rushing scores by Dylan Gustafson.

<p><strong>West Allegheny 40, Shaler 7:</strong> West Allegheny (1-1) rebounded from a season-opening loss against Moon by running past the Titans.

West Allegheny built a 20-0 lead by halftime and enforced the mercy rule by the fourth quarter. The Indians came close to shutting out the Titans, but Shaler (0-2) was able to find the end zone with 1:17 remaining.</p>
