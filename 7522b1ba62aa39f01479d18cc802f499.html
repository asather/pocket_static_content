<h1>The Next Page: COVID-19 impacts more than our physical health</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>So I'm going to say some hard things, things few people are saying out loud. They are true for me and I imagine they are true for a lot of human beings this minute, in our world. In my tears and heartbreak this morning, I need to just do the next right thing to keep going. And telling hard truths is the next right thing, right now.</p>
<p>The media reported that Allegheny County had its first death from COVID-19 March 21. And, friends, I'm going to tell you the harsh reality the media is <em>not</em> addressing: There is loss of life that is happening and will continue to happen because of the terror, loneliness and isolation resulting from social distancing. This mandated protocol promises to drastically and positively affect the numbers of Americans who would otherwise fall victim to this pandemic. That is both necessary and vital to the future of our population. Yet it's not the whole story. Just because we don't contract the new coronavirus doesn't mean we will be OK.</p>
<p>I'm going to tell you my truth this morning: <em>I'm not OK. I am not OK, today.</em></p>
<p>One day recently, I told my 12-year-old son I was going to my room to get dressed. I lied. I'm lying in bed, sobbing, wondering how to survive the alienation and anxiety of my current reality.</p>
<p>On a recent Friday night, two of my children and I temporarily moved out of our family home and into a nearby three-bedroom, 1Â½-bath home rented through Airbnb because I am immunocompromised from nine months of treatment for late-stage Lyme disease in 2016-17. I now have very little ability to fight any illness that comes my way. The decision to isolate, away from my husband Tom, my two other children who cannot be isolated and our dogs, has been nothing short of excruciating. It is the hardest thing I've voluntarily chosen to do. It is overwhelming and worse than any physical illness I have ever encountered. And it is necessary because I want and need to stay alive, and present, in my children's lives.</p>
<p>This virus didn't seem like such a big deal to me, and a lot of us, really, a couple weeks ago. I thought the mayhem was absurd. Science, though, tells a much different reality, with numbers. Then I was privvy to firsthand accounts of the toll this virus has already taken, in the U.S. alone, from medical professionals treating both children and adults. I knew I must pay attention and make some really tough decisions for the long-term well-being of my kids.</p>
<p>What I'm learning, sadly, is that this virus is a big deal for reasons other than its pathology. The effects of COVID-19 go far beyond the physical dangers it presents. It is and will consume and destroy lives in ways I, and maybe you, had not considered before.</p>
<p>I am not OK. Tonight or tomorrow, it's possible that I will rally, as I did yesterday. This morning, however, I am feeling the profound loss of my normal life, of the peace that comes with familiarity of surroundings and loved ones and my mundane dailiness, which I cannot access currently. I have never understood numbing behaviors such as cutting, boozing and drugging more than I do right now. I am not OK.</p>
<p>I've decided to broadcast this uncomfortable truth, and it's not to elicit concern or generosity toward myself. I have been privileged financially to socially isolate and stay safer than others in my world from the virus. I have electricity, running water, heat, food, hygiene products, clean clothes, a washer and dryer and the safety of the local neighborhood I've come to know and trust.</p>
<p>I have a husband who is employed and is working from home and receiving a salary that currently pays our bills. We are able to purchase food to feed four adults, two teenagers and two dogs. I am loved and supported in ways that are sustaining me and keeping my heart from breaking into a million pieces. I have two sons with me, in isolation, in this home away from home, who have been willing to comply 100% with the recommended protocols. They have voluntarily moved away from the house they know and their comfort zones, I'm pretty certain, solely because they didn't want me to be here alone.</p>
<p>Tom and my daugher Lily have come by and stood 6 feet away, on the sidewalk, in front of this townhome, to do porch dropoffs of necessities, or to tell me they love me. My son Ben has showed up on video calls to begrudgingly be present with his mother when his 17-year-old self would rather not. Friends have come by and done the same, or are planning to, or are checking in by text.</p>
<p>Yet these are not the stories of some people around me and in our society at large. While these mandatory quarantines will certainly save many, many lives, they are also inducing life-threatening depression and panic in people who may be physically protected but are in emotional devastation due to this pandemic. People are losing businesses; people are not able to go to their unsecured, hourly jobs and cannot make ends meet; people are grieving family members who have died or who are seriously ill.</p>
<p>Some people cannot be sequestered to protect their health and well-being because they are first responders, nurses, doctors, medical professionals, hospital workers or caregivers for those who have already been infected. People are battling autoimmune disorders and do not have access to and/or cannot take the medications they need.</p>
<p>And then there are people with a variety of mental health vulnerabilities, who truly depend on the company of others and access to group therapies, or, like me, just depend on their network of family and friends to maintain sanity. They don't have that support and are losing hope and their will to go on.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is <em>not</em> just like the flu. It is <em>not</em> just taking the lives being reported by the media. It is <em>not</em> just a risk to the elderly and physically fragile/ immunocompromised. Americans may not end up contracting COVID-19 in the vast numbers that the CDC and World Health Organization fear. But I'm here to tell you that many people will lose their lives because we simply are not capable of safely living apart from one another. The situation is grim, and we need to talk about it and validate the tragic consequences that isolation brings to the human condition.</p>
<p>This is what I know to be true for me today. If it is also true for you, know that I get your pain. And know that, though you may not be able to see or feel this truth, you are not alone in your struggle to survive the feelings that are overwhelming you, that are bigger than what your mind feels capable of handling.</p>
<p>I have no answers except to say, yeah.&nbsp;Me too.</p>
