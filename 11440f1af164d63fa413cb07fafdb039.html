<h1>Three residents at Kane Glen Hazel succumb to COVID-19, as Allegheny County, state cases continue to rise</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Forty-eight more residents of Allegheny County tested positive for COVID-19 since Friday, according to the latest data from the county.</p>
<p>The death count rose to 19 from 18 overnight, although it’s not yet clear if that includes three residents who died at Kane Community Living Center in Glen Hazel.</p>

<p>The assisted living facility on the banks of the Monongahela River has suffered a rash of infections, with 25 residents and 15 staff testing positive for the new coronavirus as of Friday. Another 19 tests are still pending.</p>
<p>Kane’s other three centers, in Scott, McKeesport and Ross, have had no confirmed cases although about half a dozen tests are still pending.</p>
<p>It’s been almost a month since Kane implemented a no-visitor policy and suspended communal dining and group activities.</p>
<p>Tiny Glen Hazel is by far the most impacted neighborhood per capita in Allegheny County, but updated numbers aren’t yet available.</p>
<p>Countywide, since the first case was confirmed on March 11, 836 people have tested positive and 130 have been hospitalized. Of those, 48 required intensive care and 25 needed to be put on a ventilator.</p>
<p>The vast majority of those who were hospitalized from the virus were white — 80%, while 22% were black and 27% were either of unknown race or other.</p>
<p>There was one black county resident who died and 18 white residents, according to new data released by Allegheny County on Saturday. Everyone who has died was older than 65.</p>
<p>Statewide, new confirmed infections rose to 21,655, a jump of 1,676 positive tests from Friday. During that time, 78 more Pennsylvanians died from the disease caused by the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>There have been 48 reported COVID-19 deaths among counties in southwestern Pennsylvania, according to the latest state Department of Health data, although because of reporting delays that number is already known to be higher.</p>
<p>For example, the Westmoreland County coroner has a “live-time” confirmed COVID-19 death tally that stood at 11 on Saturday, while state data only lists the county’s deaths at six.</p>
<p>The same is likely true for Allegheny County’s count.</p>
<p>Speaking at her daily briefing at noon,&nbsp;Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said the tentative conclusion from case data so far is that the state is succeeding at leveling off the curve, ensuring that new cases are following a linear rather than exponential trajectory.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to imagine that it was just New Year’s Eve when we heard about the first reports of dozens of new cases of pneumonia from an unknown cause half a world away,” Dr. Levine said, referring to cases initially reported in Wuhan, China.</p>
<p>Saturday, on the eve of the Easter holiday, she urged Pennsylvanians to take comfort in each other, not with a traditional family get-together this year but in the knowledge that&nbsp;“we have come together as a commonwealth and as a nation to reinforce that the only way through this is with each other.”</p>
<p>When pressed on what it would take to reopen the state for business — Republicans in the Pennsylvania General Assembly have introduced legislation to ease restrictions on non-life-sustaining businesses in order to shore up the economy — Dr. Levine said: “We’re not there yet.”</p>
<p>“I understand the legislature’s concern about the economy. But now is not the time. Now is the time for people to stay home and have those non-life-sustaining businesses stay closed.”</p>
<p>She reiterated that the decision to reopen parts of the state won’t be a wholesale lifting of restrictions but rather a progressive cascade. It will be based on how specific areas are doing in terms of the number new cases, the percentage of new cases to total tests being done, and new cases per capita.</p>
<p>“When we’re seeing all those measures go down, we’ll start to lift those closures” and watch those communities for potential new spikes, she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine also provided a daily update on how Pennsylvania’s healthcare systems are handling the crisis: 46% of the state’s hospital beds, 38% of beds in intensive case units and 70% of ventilators are still available.</p>
<p>She said it’s likely that the southeastern portion of the state might experience a peak in COVID-19 cases sometime next week, while the surge in the western part of Pennsylvania is likely to come a bit later.</p>
