<h1>Central Catholic's Rocco Salvitti takes first-round lead at Tri-State Open</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rocco Salvitti, a sophomore-to-be at Central Catholic High School, shot a 5-under 67 to take the first-round lead in the 36-hole Tri-State Open at Williams Country Club in Weirton, W.Va.</p>
<p>Salvitti, who finished sixth in the WPIAL Class AAA championship and seventh in the PIAA Championship, has a one-shot lead on professional Ty Roush of Riverside GC in Mason, W.Va., heading into the final round on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Salvitti is trying to become the third amateur in the past five years to win the Tri-State Open.</p>
<p>Four other players are two shots from the lead â€” professionals Devin Gee of Oakmont, John Aber of Allegheny and Brett Carman of Valley Brook, and amateur Rick Stimmel of Diamond Run.</p>
<p>Former Tri-State Open champion Kevin Shields, director of instruction at the Club at Nevillewood, is one of four players at 2-under 70.</p>
