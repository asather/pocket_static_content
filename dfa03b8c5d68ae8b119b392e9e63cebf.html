<h1>WATCH: Steelers' JuJu Smith-Schuster goes cliff diving in Hawaii</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Remember last July when Steelers receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/07/25/Top-10-weirdest-Steelers-training-camp-entrances/stories/201907250062" target="_blank">considered skydiving</a> into the first day of training camp? That ultimately didn’t happen, probably because the 23-year-old realized putting himself in a position to get hurt wasn’t the greatest idea for his livelihood.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Wednesday, and Smith-Schuster seems to be taking a slightly more laissez-faire attitude toward his physical well-being.</p>
<p>Smith-Schuster — who is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/02/Pittsburgh-Steelers-Kevin-Colbert-Cam-Heyward-Vance-McDonald-Ramon-Foster-Anthony-Chickillo-Mark-Barron/stories/202001020107" target="_blank">up for a contract extension</a> either this offseason or in 2021 — posted a video of himself cliff diving into a lagoon in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Here’s the full video from his vacation that he uploaded to YouTube.</p>

<p>Right before he jettisoned himself off the cliff, you can hear Smith-Schuster say, “It’s my contract year, send it!” Clearly, he’s more than aware of his financial situation.</p>
<p>Through the first two years of his career, it looked like Smith-Schuster was going to be the next great Steelers receiver. That’s still entirely possible, though he had a <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SmitJu00.htm" target="_blank">disappointing 2019-20 season</a> in just about every statistical way.</p>
<p>His down year was partially due to the carousel of quarterbacks throwing to him following Ben Roethlisberger’s early season-ending injury and the knee ailment that plagued him in the back half of the 2019 campaign.</p>
<p>Steelers nation is probably hoping that Smith-Schuster’s Hawaii excursion has left him rested, ready to get back to his previous form and, most importantly, injury-free.</p>
