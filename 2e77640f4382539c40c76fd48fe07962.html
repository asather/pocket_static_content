<h1>Email error revealed names of 47 Pittsburgh diocese abuse claimants</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh launched its compensation program for victims of sexual abuse by priests, participants were guaranteed confidentiality.</p>
<p>But the names of 47 claimants were inadvertently leaked in an email from the program administrator to an unintended recipient.</p>
<p>While all agree the leak was unintentional and didn’t spread any further, the person who received it said the 47 should have been notified long ago.</p>
<p>The incident occurred in 2019 when the program administrator, Camille Biros of the Kenneth Feinberg law firm, forwarded an email to members of her staff. But when she typed one of the names, the email client auto-populated the address field with the address of a different person in her contact list with a similar name, and she failed to catch it before sending it.</p>
<p>The recipient, who spoke to the Post-Gazette but did not want to be identified, had participated in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia’s compensation program because she was a victim of abuse by one of its priests. Her name was in Ms. Biros’ contact list because she had previously corresponded with her regarding her claim.</p>
<p>The recipient said she only shared the email with a judge who headed an oversight board for the Philadelphia program because she wanted the board to be aware of it.</p>
<p>She is raising the issue because she said she spent the past year urging that the victims at least be notified and that those overseeing the program should consider privacy improvements such as encryption.</p>
<p>Ms. Biros said in a statement: “There was no data leak or breach. It was an unfortunate error of a misdirected mail by me.”</p>
<p>Ms. Biros did not comment on whether the 47 were notified. She said that&nbsp;“the sole recipient of the misdirected email came forward, and we considered that the end of the issue.”</p>
<p>The recipient, however, drew from her experience in the health care field, noting that — under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act — if a provider breaches the confidentiality of patient information, it needs to alert that patient of the breach. She also cited the example of companies alerting customers to breaches of credit card information.</p>
<p>“Somebody is responsible for notifying them,” she said.&nbsp;“If this was a store, they would have been notified.”</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh diocese hired the Feinberg firm in the wake of the 2018 statewide grand jury report into sexual abuse by priests. The firm evaluates claims and sets amounts for the diocese to pay.&nbsp;The Pittsburgh diocese received 367 claims in total for its Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program, and the Feinberg firm is still processing some of the claims. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/08/13/Pittsburgh-Roman-Catholic-Diocese-sex-abuse-priest-scandal-litigation-grand-jury-report-anniversary/stories/202008130135" target="_blank">Some who rejected settlement offers are now suing</a>.</p>
<p>The Feinberg firm is renowned for handling large-scale compensation funds in the wake of disasters such as the 9/11 attacks and the BP oil spill, and it has handled abuse-related funds for numerous dioceses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The email listed the names of 47 claimants without details of the claims. The email said 45 were eligible under the program, which covers abuse by diocesan priests, and two were not because they claimed abuse by religious-order priests.</p>
<p>The protocols of the compensation program on the diocesan website state: “This program is confidential.” Information can be shared only in narrow circumstances, such as processing the claim or reporting to law enforcement. The protocols say the program is governed by Pennsylvania law guarding the confidentiality of mediation processes.</p>
<p>The Diocese of Pittsburgh said in a statement it was notified by the Feinberg firm of the incident.&nbsp;‘We were informed that this was the result of human error,” the diocese said. “Feinberg advised us that they discussed the matter with the unintended recipient and believed the matter to be resolved.”</p>
<p>It added: “In accordance with the original agreement with the Feinberg Law Group, we do not know, nor were told, nor should we have been told the information that was mistakenly shared because of the independence of the fund.”</p>
<p>The person who received the email said she recognizes it was unintentional but is frustrated by the response. “They made me part of it,” she said. “My part of this is: Alert the people you violated.”</p>
