<h1>Mayor Peduto offers reassurance but warns of 'dark days ahead' for city budget</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto on Thursday praised Pittsburgh’s work in the battle against COVID-19 — highlighting essential workers, medical practitioners and the social distancing members of the public — but he also warned of&nbsp;“darks days ahead” for the city’s budget.</p>
<p>“The bones of a strong budget remain from the hard lessons we learned through Act 47, but the financial picture is still bleak,” Mr. Peduto said during his&nbsp;3 p.m. virtual public address that lasted roughly 13 minutes.</p>
<p>The city has built up approximately $85 million in reserves since 2014, but the fallout from a global pandemic will likely mean a deficit of tens of millions just this year,&nbsp;“which will then have heavy repercussions onto our next five years of budgets,” he said</p>
<p>The city was released from state financial oversight in February 2018 and has been operating on a surplus. (Controller Michael Lamb in July <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/07/01/pittsburgh-finances-controller-michael-lamb-popular-annual-finance-report-parks-ballot-initiative/stories/201907010115" target="_blank">said the city was on pace for a&nbsp;“significant surplus” in 2019</a>.)</p>
<p>While the mayor warned of large spending cuts to come, he did not announce any concrete budget changes during his speech.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto also used his address to praise the city’s essential workers -— for whom the city is&nbsp;“going above CDC standards” by providing masks and stringent cleaning of work facilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date, five Public Safety employees and two sanitation workers <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/09/pittsburgh-police-covid-19-coronavirus-more-officers-test-positive/stories/202004090137" target="_blank">have tested positive for COVID-19</a>. The city announced Wednesday that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/15/First-pittsburgh-environmental-services-worker-dies-of-COVID-19/stories/202004150093" target="_blank">a refuse collection truck driver died of the virus</a>.</p>
<p>While the city has been planning around the principals of&nbsp;“resiliency” since Mr. Peduto took office,&nbsp;“nothing fully prepared us for this,” he said.</p>
<p>“At no point will the need be greater for major nonprofits, foundations and the corporate community to come together collectively to guarantee a Pittsburgh for all,” he said, echoing his previous arguments <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/04/14/Mayor-Peduto-OnePGH-report-pittsburgh-raise-critical-needs-tax-exempt-organizations/stories/201904110090" target="_blank">for his OnePGH proposal</a> in which large tax-exempt nonprofits would contribute to a fund to address the city’s&nbsp;“critical needs.”</p>
<p>The mayor praised Pittsburgh’s private employers, including restaurants that are donating food; the foundation community that is plugging&nbsp;“holes in the social safety net”; and the “meds-and-eds industry,” citing that, as of Wednesday, 327 ICU beds and 835 ventilators were available in the county.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the time the mayor’s address ended, those numbers had updated on Allegheny County’s <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/85054b06472e4208b02285b8557f24cf" target="_blank">Hospital Preparedness dashboard</a> to show 316 ICU beds and 840 ventilators available.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto argued for aiming high in the&nbsp;“new normal,” including calling for closing the digital divide, better health care access, commitments to clean energy, family sustaining wages and putting&nbsp;“Western Pennsylvanians back to work with a massive infrastructure bill,” he said.</p>
<p>Much of that does not fall under the purview of Pittsburgh’s mayor, but Mr. Peduto said he hopes to see various sectors working together once the virus subsides.</p>
<p>“Leveraging the lessons we are learning from the COVID-19 pandemic, we will forge new partnerships among labor, the business, foundation and nonprofit communities, and our federal, state and county leaders, to make our city stronger than ever. It will require sacrifice by all,” he said.</p>
