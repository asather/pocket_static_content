<h1>New Light Congregation won't return to Tree of Life site</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Members of New Light Congregation have decided to remain for the long term at&nbsp;Congregation Beth Shalom, rather than returning to a reopened Tree of Life synagogue building, where New Light lost three members in the <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/pittsburgh-squirrel-hill-synagogue-massacre/" target="_blank">Oct. 27, 2018, anti-Semitic massacre</a>.</p>
<p>The New Light members voted unanimously to stay at Beth Shalom at a congregational meeting on Sunday, said New Light co-president Stephen Cohen.</p>
<p>They have been worshiping in a chapel at Beth Shalom, located in Squirrel Hill less than a mile from the Tree of Life site, since the 2018 attack.&nbsp;Beth Shalom has “been warm and welcoming,” Mr. Cohen said.&nbsp;“It’s a very good partnership.”</p>
<p>The New Light congregation had already moved twice in recent years, once after selling its own synagogue in a 2017 downsizing and again after being displaced by the 2018 attack.</p>
<p>“It was always our intention from the very beginning to return to the Tree of Life building,” Mr. Cohen said.</p>
<p>But with no definite timeline yet on when the Tree of Life site would reopen, the members opted to stay put in a place where they had come to feel at home.&nbsp;New Light members decided they didn’t want the disruption of planning yet another move on an uncertain timetable, and they also wanted to give Tree of Life leaders a firm answer so the latter could better plan for the future of the site.</p>
<p>The partnership with Tree of Life also worked well before it was tragically cut short, Mr. Cohen said. New Light had its own worship space and the shared use of the synagogue kitchen. “We had a very happy year there” at Tree of Life before the attack, Mr. Cohen said.</p>
<p>On Oct. 27, 2018, a gunman linked to anti-Semitic hate speech killed 11 worshipers from three congregations that shared space in the Tree of Life / Or L’Simcha synagogue building. New Light lost members&nbsp;<a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/squirrel-hill-massacre-victims/" target="_blank">Richard Gottfried, Daniel Stein and Melvin Wax</a>. The gunman also killed seven Tree of Life members and one from Congregation Dor Hadash.</p>
<p>The Tree of Life and Dor Hadash congregations have been holding their worship services at Rodef Shalom Congregation in Shadyside since the attack.</p>
<p>Tree of Life congregational officials have announced their intention to return to the site, although <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/10/18/Tree-of-Life-terrorist-attack-undecided-demolish-renovate-building-Pittsburgh/stories/201910180129" target="_blank">major decisions are still being worked out</a>, including whether to restore or replace the synagogue building. The congregation has worked with the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh on the plans, which tentatively include hosting the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh and Chatham University.</p>
<p>Barb Feige, executive director of Tree of Life, said she respected New Light’s decision.</p>
<p>“We would welcome them at any time,” she said. At the same time, “we understand their responsibility is to their congregation to do what’s right for them.”</p>
<p>Kenneth Turkewitz, interim executive director at Beth Shalom, said the relationship between the two congregations has “worked out wonderfully” since New Light began worshiping in its building. Both are in the Conservative stream of Judaism, and they’ve been able to share in some joint activities.</p>
<p>“We enjoy having them here,” he said, adding that Beth Shalom has sought to “do everything we can to accommodate the congregation” after it suffered the attack.</p>
