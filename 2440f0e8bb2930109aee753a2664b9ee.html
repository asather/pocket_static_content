<h1>Pirates’ problems greater than minutiae of Sunday’s loss</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CHICAGO — Offense in baseball can often function as Febreze — it masks the ugly stuff.</p>
<p>Sunday in Chicago as the Pirates tried to avoid a Cubs sweep at Wrigley Field, there was no such odor eliminator, the same as it’s been for much of the season.</p>
<p>The Pirates technically lost to the Cubs, 2-1, in 11 innings when Javier Baez smoked a Cody Ponce offering up the middle that allowed David Bote to easily jog home from third base.</p>
<p>But one hit did the trick because the Pirates weren’t able to score after Kevin Newman’s solo homer in the first inning, even against a wobbly Cubs bullpen that entered Sunday’s game lugging around an MLB-worst 9.75 ERA.</p>
<p>“We’re right there,” Jacob Stallings said. “It’s all you can ask for at the end of the game, to be right there and have a chance to win. We’re just not pulling ’em out.”</p>
<p>No, they certainly are not. The Pirates have dropped seven of their nine games thus far, the equivalent of a 5-19 start in a normal season. They’re hitting .177 as a team, and their best batting average belongs to Phillip Evans (.316).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Pirates now have four pitchers on the 10-day injured list and have been missing another one since the start of spring training 2.0 because of COVID-19 — although Keone Kela is apparently on his way back.</p>
<p>It has been anything but a smooth ride for the Pirates thus far, which means that — with a razor-thin margin for error — even the tiniest decisions often matter.</p>
<p>Sunday was one of those games.</p>
<p>The big moment in this one came in the top of the 10th inning. With Stallings starting at second base, Josh Bell got things going with a single. Should manager Derek Shelton have pinch-run for Stallings? Perhaps, although his two options were John Ryan Murphy and Gregory Polanco.</p>
<p>Shelton said he didn’t want to risk potential injury with Polanco on a “wet track” after a 64-minute rain relay.</p>
<p>After Bell shot his base hit into left, Cubs left fielder Kyle Schwarber made a strong throw that nailed Stallings by a good bit. The Pirates argued that the ensuing collision occurred because Stallings had nowhere else to go. The umpires did not agree, affirming that Stallings was out and telling the Pirates catcher he should've tried to slide.</p>
<p>"I was 10-15 feet up the line," Stallings said. "I’m not going to slide all the way out there. But that’s the rule."</p>
<p>It was also an aggressive send by third-base coach Joey Cora — some might say a little too aggressive. Had Stallings held up, the Pirates would've had three cracks to score a runner from third with nobody out.</p>
<p>Shelton, however, had no issue with Cora's aggressiveness there.</p>
<p>"I think we give more credit to Schwarber," Shelton said. "He made a hell of a throw. The throw had to be right on the money.</p>
<p>"I think Joey does a hell of a job over there. He’s aggressive. He’s consistent. I think he’s one of the better third-base coaches in baseball, so no problem with that send.”</p>
<p>An inning later, the Pirates made a definite mistake when Newman ran into an out at third base, taking himself out of scoring position when he was thrown out by Baez.</p>
<p>The right play there is to wait, allow the throw to cross the infield, then try to advance. You never make the first or third out at third because of outs left and the fact that you’re still in scoring position.</p>
<p>"We have to be a little more aware of where Baez is on that play right there and also knowing how well Javy moves and how well he throws," Shelton said.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ lack of consistent offense also puts a spotlight on every single pitching performance and decision made by Shelton, whereas a few three-run homers here and there might enable everyone to look the other way.</p>
<p>Sunday, let’s start with Steven Brault, who was perfect through three innings while striking out four. Before the season and coming off recurring shoulder issues, Shelton decided he would use Brault and Chad Kuhl in a piggyback situation, knowing this could happen.</p>
<p>Brault was cruising, but the Pirates — like it or hate it — didn’t want Brault’s start-to-start jump to be more than one inning. So Shelton pulled the plug on Brault and turned to Kuhl, who lasted just 1⅓&nbsp;innings.</p>
<p>Turns out Kuhl has an abrasion to the cuticle of his right index finger, and it was causing him considerable pain, enough that the Pirates also worried about Kuhl overcompensating with his mechanics and risking further injury.</p>
<p>Bottom line, there were reasonable calls for Brault to stick around, but Shelton’s move looked worse because there’s absolutely no wiggle room right now.</p>
<p>“We knew exactly where he was going to be at," Shelton said of Brault. "The fact that he had only thrown two innings the last time because of the rain delay, no way were we going to extend it."</p>
<p>Brault also said he was fine with the early hook.</p>
<p>"I understand Shelty’s trying to keep me healthy, trying to build me up," Brault said. "I’m totally down [with it]. I want to be a starter. I know he knows that. I feel like I'd rather be safe and make sure I don't aggravate anything.”</p>
<p>That move ultimately backfired on Shelton when, as Kuhl's finger started to cause him issues, Willson Contreras and Schwarber roped back-to-back doubles to make it a 1-1 game.</p>
<p>We'll leave the Pirates' middle relievers for another day — Dovydas Neverauskas (6.27 career ERA) is tied for the team lead in appearances — as a more interesting decision occurred in the ninth.</p>
<p>It, too, was tied to a pitcher's health.</p>
<p>Shelton planned on bringing Nick Burdi into the game … until a sudden rain came a little earlier than expected. Burdi never pitched, but he was officially put into the game.</p>
<p>After the wait, however, Shelton didn't want to risk it and turned things over to Sam Howard and Ponce. With Burdi out, the Pirates were forced to turn to a pair of guys who had been working out in Altoona and only joined the club for this trip as part of the taxi squad.</p>
<p>Howard fared well, tossing a pair of scoreless innings, although Ponce was forced to make his MLB debut in less-than-ideal circumstances, with Baez delivering the walkoff win for the Cubs.</p>
<p>"It’s unbelievably difficult," Shelton said. "Obviously we were down to him in the bullpen with what we had available from the guys that threw [Saturday]. Again, trying to be extremely mindful of health because we’ve lost four pitchers in the last week.</p>
<p>“I thought [Ponce] did a good job. He came in and threw strikes."</p>
<p>There were a few positives to take out of Sunday's loss. Newman collected a pair of hits and appears to have found his stroke at the plate. He did an excellent job getting around on an inside cutter for his home run, the type of pitch he was missing before.</p>
<p>Brault was also outstanding. Stallings said it was unquestionably the best he's ever seen the Pirates left-hander throw.</p>
<p>But until the Pirates start giving themselves some sort of cushion, this stuff is bound to happen: the fretting over the usage (or in Burdi's case, non-usage) of pitchers, late-game strategy and calls that may not go the Pirates’ way.</p>
<p>"With all the injuries that we had this series, it’s especially tough," Stallings said. "But we’re right there.</p>
<p>"I don’t know that I have a reason that keeps happening, but I know we have guys who are going to keep playing until the final out. It’s frustrating."</p>
