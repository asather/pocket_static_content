<h1>Pittsburgh Public Schools pushing back start date</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools announced Saturday night that it has delayed the start of the school year to Sept. 8.</p>
<p>The change postpones the start of classes for all students preK-12. Originally, all but kindergarten and pre-kindergarten were scheduled to start&nbsp; Aug. 31. Kindergarten and preK were scheduled to begin Sept. 3.</p>
<p>The delay is due to a nationwide technology supply-chain shortages, according to the school district, which has prevented it from providing laptops to all its in-need students in order for them to learn from home.&nbsp;The PPS board mandated in late July that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/07/31/Pittsburgh-Public-Schools-board-vote-start-school-year-online/stories/202007310129" target="_blank">students will spend at least the first nine weeks of the school year taking classes virtually</a>.</p>
<p>Up to 7,000 laptops are expected to arrive by the end of next week to fulfill the outstanding need, the district said, though some are not expected to be delivered until late October.</p>
<p>“Similar to school districts in our region, we must delay the start of school to ensure all students have the opportunity to fully participate in E-Learning,” Superintendent Anthony Hamlet said in a statement. “At this time the distribution of devices is only for those families of students who do not have access to a device. By delaying the start of school we can ensure that no student is inequitably disadvantaged because they do not have access to the tools they need to start the school year successfully.”</p>
<p>“School staff will spend the next week creating and refining lesson plans, review Individualized Education Plans of special education students, contact hard to reach families and participate in grade-level professional development.” the statement said.</p>
<p>As of Aug. 27, according to the district, more than 6,440 of the devices that were ordered last spring were exchanged or distributed to students in need, although more than 1,800 students still have a device from last school year that will not work for E-learning this year. Those devices will be exchanged as soon as possible, the district said.</p>
<p>Because Pittsburgh Public Schools is a community eligibility school district, Comcast Internet Essentials, a low-cost internet provider, is available to all families. The District additionally is in the process of collecting hotspots it issued to graduating seniors last year so that it can give them to families who need them for classroom work.</p>
<p>The district also said that it will work with school staff to ensure that materials will be made available for students if delays continue past the start of classes.</p>
