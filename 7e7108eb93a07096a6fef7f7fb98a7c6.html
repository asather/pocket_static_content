<h1>North Side man to face federal drug charges after police seize 13,000 stamp bags of heroin</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A North Side man will face federal drug trafficking charges after&nbsp;“extensive” surveillance of him revealed he was allegedly hiding large amounts of heroin and other drugs in a Troy Hill basement and garage.</p>
<p>Aaron Gale, 26, who has a history of drug and firearms charges, was arrested Thursday when local and federal agents surrounded him behind a house in the 1900 block Lowrie Street, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Detectives had been monitoring the property after receiving&nbsp;“multiple complaints&nbsp;from community members who suspected that drugs were being trafficked out of this residence,” Pittsburgh police said.</p>
<p>The exact duration of the investigation was not specified in the complaint, but the document states that Gale&nbsp;“was often seen” accessing an underground area through what appeared to be BILCO-style doors and then securing the entrance to that area afterward. He also often disappeared behind the house and reappeared a short time later, the complaint said.</p>
<p>The investigation culminated just before 11 a.m. Thursday when detectives were ready to execute a search warrant. While approaching the house, they&nbsp;“noticed a target vehicle” —&nbsp; a Chevy Malibu with Gale in the driver’s seat — driving directly behind them, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Detectives blocked the car in the alley behind the house, and Gale was arrested on site. Detectives entered the underground area — covered by plywood “made secure by a cinderblock on top of it” — and found 80 bricks of heroin labeled&nbsp;“Pablo Escobar/Al Capone,” according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Upon searching a rear garage, detectives found a loaded&nbsp;Sig Sauer 9 mm pistol and an even larger amount of heroin hidden in a wall behind a piece of plywood and labeled “gambino/El Chapa Guzman,” according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Gale, a convicted felon, is not legally allowed to possess a weapon.</p>
<p>In total, police found 260 bricks (or 13,000 stamp bags) of heroin,&nbsp;Percocet pills, MDMA (or ecstasy), and a large amount of cash, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>A person living at the address identified as Harmony Bey said that Gale is her&nbsp;“cousin’s boyfriend” and that despite being told not to return, he still accesses the basement of the home, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>A search of a second location in the North Side yielded additional heroin and&nbsp;“a large bag of cocaine,” according to Pittsburgh police.</p>
<p>Gale is scheduled for a preliminary hearing before U.S. District Judge Lisa Lenihan on Jan. 22.</p>
