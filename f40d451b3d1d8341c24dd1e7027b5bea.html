<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 05.13.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi folks. Thanks for joining my weekly chat. Seems like there's a lot to talk about; so, don't be shy. Fire away. I'll be back at noon to answer any and all of your questions. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Alright, let's get this thing started ...</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Is now the right time to bring Lonnie Chisenhall back to the Pirates? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Is there ever a wrong time? ... Seriously, I don't know why, I had forgotten for a couple days that they signed Lonnie Chisenhall to an actual major league contract last year. Thank you for the reminder.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Has anyone ever worked out how much money an MLB team makes on average for fans at ballparks, e.g., average ticket price and additional money spent on concessions, parking, etc? In other words, if games are played without fans in the stadium, how much will it cost a team given what that team's average crowd size would be? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Sorry for the delay folks. Received a call for a story I've been working on that I had to take. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Rich, <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Forbes did something like what you're talking about last month. I'll link it below. Short answer, the Pirates are near the bottom of stadium revenue. I think it's tougher to say how much things would cost because not all of what would be paid out is publicly available information. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2020/04/17/the-mlb-stadium-revenue-at-risk-for-every-team-if-games-are-played-without-fans/#3072e7947a35" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2020/04/17/the-mlb-stadium-re...</a></p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: If you had the power to make owners and players adhere to your decision, how would you divide up this years baseball earnings and pay players and owners? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I would pay the players what was negotiated -- their pro-rated salaries. My primary goal would be getting baseball back ASAP. Then, I would try to monetize things to make up the money. Maybe I try to put ads on uniforms. Or on tarped seats inside the ballpark, ads on the outfield, etc. Just one year. But players -- and fans -- would have to be understanding that things are a little different. I wouldn't engaged in this current financial battle because I think it takes away from making the sport as popular as possible. And if that happens, as someone who's in charge, I would stand to make much more in the long run than I would short-term haggling over player salaries.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: two questions- who are two names you’d expect the pirates to take at #7 ( a pitcher and a position player) please don’t say Austin Hendrick <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Ha. What do you have against Austin Hendrick? I just wrote something about their pitching prospects being better than some might think, but I would still like to see them add another arm. Max Meyer (RHP Minnesota) and Reid Detmers (LHP Louisville) are two intriguing options. I could also see them looking at NC State catcher Patrick Bailey given how little talent they have at that position. Also wouldn't rule out Hendrick. He should be around.</p>
<p><strong>Steven</strong>: two Names to watch out for with the pirates and pick #7? Position player and a pitcher? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: If I had to pick two from what I just typed, I think I would go Bailey and Detmers. Gonna violate the rules here and throw out Cade Cavalli, a RHP from Oklahoma. Would make a lot of sense as well.</p>
<p><strong>Steven</strong>: last question- I’ve always felt Jason Kendall was a respectable man who resembles the Pirates organizational values, charitable, and a good teammate. Why isn’t he remembered like that within the organization? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know, Steven. I wonder that sometimes, too. I guess the reputation he seemed to get? However, I've never understood that. He messed with Jack Wilson some, but by Jack's own admission, that narrative is wrong. I think Kendall is a really good dude. He's become a friend, honestly. I think the Pirates -- and any other baseball club -- would be wise to hire him. At minimum, I think he's worth celebrating as an important part of your organization. I suppose, also, that a lack of winning during his time here had something to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: if We are going to add a DH we need it to be puig. We could put puig in the outfield and DH polanco if his arm isn’t healthy <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: The weekly Yasiel Puig nonsense ... The Pirates NEED it to be Puig? Please. I'd rather make Colin Moran my DH and get Ke'Bryan Hayes going. Or give Gregory Polanco a few more days off in the outfield, allowing Guillermo Heredia, Jason Martin or Jared Oliva to play. Maybe they can get Jose Osuna's bat into the lineup. What will Yasiel Puig reasonably get you? Is he going to take the Pirates to the playoffs? Help them reach the NLCS? I'm all for them spending more money; I just wouldn't do it on Yasiel Puig.</p>
<p><strong>Itsyoboi</strong>: When’s the earliest we can expect a proposal to be agreed on? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I believe they're meeting again Thursday. MLB just sent over like an 80-page proposal on health and safety, which is great. I would say Thursday afternoon, but I think that's way, way too optimistic given what we know about financials. Probably next week is more likely.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: How do you feel the Buccos would do in their rumored division? I think it is obvious they get beat up by the Yanks but I think they could get some good wins off of the likes of the Orioles, Marlins, Blue Jays, Red Sox. I would like them to be with the Phills, Mets, in the middle of the pack. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: That's not their rumored division. Or at least not the new one. MLB's current plan has them playing against the AL Central, which includes the Twins, Tigers, Indians, White Sox and Royals. I actually think that could be a good thing for them. More difficult, of course, will be the NL Central.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: This is driving me crazy. The players are being painted as if they are asking for their full salaries, that "they won't take a pay cut." They have already agreed to a 50% pay cut, but many don't want to paint it that way. Asking for your agreed upon compensation is not greedy; it just isn't. Also, what I or my neighbor or anyone else makes (or doesn't) has nothing to do with MLB negotiations. It's all relative. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I agree with you, James. I don't have any issue with the players saying, hey, we already agreed to something here ... and it includes a 50% pay cut. I also think it stinks that the owners went this route to start -- the revenue sharing thing -- which will force the players to bat it away and look like jerks. As I said before, if I'm an owner, I'm thinking bigger here. Look at other stuff that has happened during the pandemic. It has been hugely popular. I'd want baseball on the field. Get the players paid, get 'em to spring training 2.0 and get going as soon as is reasonably healthy. Then find other ways to make money off of this.</p>
<p><strong>BobK</strong>: How likely do you think it is that the owners and players will be able to reach an agreement? seems like its more than money - some players very concerned about safety. Is there a chance some players dont agree to play but others do? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think they'll agree. Had someone reinforce to me last night that there's too much money at stake here. Eventually, something will get done. However, I just hope it doesn't take too terribly long or look too terribly bad before it does get done.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: How do you feel the Buccos would fair in their rumored division? I think they could be better than the Orioles, Marlins, Blue Jays, but definetly worse than Nats, Yanks, leaving them in the middle with the Rays, Phils, Red Sox, and Mets. 1. Yanks, 2. Nats, 3. Rays, 4. Phils, 5. Mets, 6. Pirates, 7. Red Sox, 8. Blue Jays, 9. Marlins, 10. Orioles. Maybe a little too boolish on the Pirates? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey Mike, first off, that wouldn't be their division. Under the current plan, they're looking at NL Central playing the division and the AL Central. So, in addition to the Cubs, Cardinals, Brewers and Reds, the Pirates would play the Indians, Twins, Tigers, White Sox and Royals. As I said, I think they would actually do reasonably well against those teams. They might finish third.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: Yasiel puig is a lot better than Jason Martin would be and yes puig could get us in the playoffs. Half the league is making it <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I never said he wasn't better than Martin. But the Pirates scored runs last year. That wasn't the issue. They pitched like crap. Spend money ... on a starter or proven reliever. That's my thought process. Plus, Puig doesn't exactly come with a sterling reputation. Coming off a 69-win season, is that really a variable they should introduce? We might have to agree to disagree on that one.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: What’s the best case scenario stat line for Hayes? Also, how could the pirates realistically make playoffs? What would have to happen <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I could see Hayes hitting like .275 or something. If there are some power numbers there -- some, not a ton -- I'm completely cool with it, as long as the defense stays. I'm assuming you mean in MLB, too.</p>
<p><strong>Jordy</strong>: If players agree on a proposal next week, why would it take so long to send players to camp June 10th. Quartine for 2 weeks would be well before June 10th <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Very true. I think they're giving them time to get packed and move. Some guys wouldn't just be moving somewhere for spring training. In the Pirates case, Trevor Williams might be coming to Pittsburgh with three kids under five for the next however many months. Now, I agree, people do that all the time, and it doesn't require a month. But I think that's the intent. I could definitely see them moving it up.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Hi Jason. No question but if the current plan has them playing only the AL and NL central, that is definitely good for the Buccos. If you look back at the last few years, they have a good record against those two divisions. The NL west, NL east, and AL east beat their brains in. Sorry you don't get to go to Frisco this season. Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thanks for the comments, Mark. I'm sorry, too. Ugh. I also don't think we would be traveling, at least at first. That really stinks. I miss it. But, yeah, San Francisco is definitely my favorite. ... Agree on the divisions. I think this is a much better outcome for the Pirates than having to survive the NL/AL East.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Lots of scuttlebutt about teams taking signable players in the draft and offering under-slot to save money and just take the comp pick next year to save money now. Any opinion on the Pirate strategy? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't see the Pirates doing that, honestly. They need to add talent. Now is definitely not the time to do that. They need to get a future building block, pay him what he's worth and get him into the fold. I trust that the guys they hired will grasp that.</p>
<p><strong>Joe west is terrible</strong>: are the pirates done adding to this team or could they possibly pick up another pitcher from the free agent market or a trade? Also could they add any hitters due to more players on a roster <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think expanded rosters will have them adding anyone. I would expect those four or so spots to go to a couple pitchers and maybe an extra bat, specifically someone like Cole Tucker. I think they will keep Holland, and he will become their fifth starter. As for adding anyone else, probably not, honestly. I think they're pretty much set.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Any word on what the taxi squad would mean as far as compensation and service? Basically, would they receive anything for being inactive, or only if they were the active 30? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: No word yet. I think they would have to figure that out. My guess is it will be part of the financial discussions, although obviously not a primary driver. But no word on that sort of compensation yet.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: Would they play the nl central a lot more than Al central or would they keep it about the same <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think they would play the NL Central more. How much more, I don't know. But I could see starting with 30 games -- 3 home, 3 away -- against the other league, then 52 against your own traditional division, 13 against each opponent. That's loose and off the top of my head, but I think it will be something like that.</p>
<p><strong>BobK</strong>: With 20 guys on taxi, i presume the remainder of minor leaguers go to spring training complexes and we suddenly have a de facto 'academy system' for this year. Interesting how the owners are working to turn this batch of lemons into tasty lemonade..... ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think you're right, Bob. They will play intrasquad games, and it honestly might be kind of interesting. But, yeah, I don't see them playing games in their affiliated cities this season. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. Looks like that does it for this week. Thanks for hanging out and asking some questions. Look forward to doing this again next Wednesday.</p>
