<h1>Allegheny County plumbing inspectors face felony charges for allegedly falsifying inspections</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two Allegheny County plumbing inspectors were charged with multiple felonies Thursday after police allege the employees falsified plumbing inspections, county police Superintendent Coleman McDonough said in a press release.</p>
<p>On June 30, the Allegheny County Health Department requested assistance from county police regarding several plumbing inspectors possibly falsifying inspections and taking bribes, according to a criminal complaint. On July 2, detectives met with plumbing program manager Ivo Miller, who told police that he had found patterns of inspectors scheduling inspections from outside their assigned areas and completing them outside of normal work hours on days they were off, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller told police some of the inspection photos had different dates than when the inspection was reported and others were photos taken of a picture displayed on another electronic or cellular device. Mr. Miller also told police he observed this behavior specifically with inspectors Michael Kevin O’Toole and Timothy Chelosky, stating they both used their personal cellphones for scheduling inspections and that&nbsp;“the overwhelming majority” of them were requested by Matt Mertz Plumbing Inc.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Mr. Miller told police, he went to inspect a Pittsburgh Water &amp; Sewer Authority lead water line replacement along Beechwood Boulevard and was met there by a person identified as Brian Tarr, who was working for Matt Mertz Plumbing. Mr. Miller told police when he discovered Mr. Tarr did not have a plumbing license, as required by law, Mr. Tarr told him that some of the county plumbing inspectors were being paid off to allow this and other&nbsp;“inappropriate/illegal behavior” and that no inspectors had been coming to these jobs while Mr. Tarr had been working on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;Superintendent McDonough, detectives “reviewed records and automated processes associated with the inspections.” Detectives also conducted physical surveillance of county plumbing inspectors and the sites where the inspections were to take place.</p>
<p>According to police, Mr. Chelosky, 53, of McKeesport, allegedly submitted inspection certification reports for dates and times at properties&nbsp;“he wouldn’t have been capable of completing due to his being at the properties so briefly as to be impossible to have completed the work he reported.” On July 30, detectives surveyed a residence Mr. Chelosky reported he would inspect — with the listing stating it was for Matt Mertz Plumbing&nbsp;— however, detectives did not see him there during the time they were monitoring. The criminal complaint also states Mr. Chelosky allegedly submitted an inspection report in the name of another former inspector, knowing the report was false.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the criminal complaint, detectives spoke with residents who said they did not have inspections done on the date and time indicated by Mr. Chelosky and Mr. O’Toole separately on inspection certification reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police also say detectives monitored properties and did not see Mr. O’Toole,&nbsp;57, of Pittsburgh, on the dates and times he reported, according to the complaint. Police also say Mr. O’Toole submitted reports for properties with dates and times that his vehicle was documented to have been traveling in other locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. O’Toole is being charged with 11 felony counts of tampering with public records or information, and Mr. Chelosky is being charged with four felony counts of tampering with public records or information, according to court documents. Both Mr. O’Toole and Mr. Chelosky were being paid by Allegheny County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both men were taken into custody and transported to Allegheny County Jail to await arraignment, Superintendent McDonough said. County spokesperson Amie Downs said both have been suspended pending an internal investigation. The investigation is still ongoing. Superintendent McDonough advises the public to call the county police tip line at&nbsp;1-833-ALL-TIPS (1-833-255-8477). Callers can remain anonymous.</p>
