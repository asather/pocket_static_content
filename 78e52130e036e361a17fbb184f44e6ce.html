<h1>A really big dill: Seth Rogen's 'An American Pickle,' shot in Pittsburgh, will stream on HBO Max</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“An American Pickle,” the Seth Rogen comedy shot around the Pittsburgh area in 2018, will be streaming on HBO Max this summer.</p>
<p>The feature film stars Rogen in a dual role as immigrant laborer Herschel Greenbaum, who falls into a vat of brine in 1920 and emerges 100 years later, perfectly preserved but eminently confused by a new world. Rogan also plays the pickle man’s great-grandson, Ben.</p>
<p>Brandon Trost directed the project, which is from producers Rogen, Evan Goldberg and James Weaver’s company, Point Grey.</p>
<p>The Warner Max label will release “An American Pickle,” having acquired the worldwide rights from Sony Pictures.</p>
<p>With the pandemic forcing theater releases back into the calendar, smaller films such as “An American Pickle” face getting overlooked, one of the reasons Sony might have wanted it online.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t be more thrilled to be partnering with HBO Max to release this film. We worked very hard and put as much of ourselves in this story as possible,” Rogen said in a statement.</p>
<p>The screenplay is by Simon Rich, who adapted his 2013 story from The New Yorker. HBO Max is scheduled for launch May 27.</p>
