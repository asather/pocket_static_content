<p>Urgent warning signs that someone should seek medical attention include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to rouse, and bluish lips or face.</p>
<p>Health experts have stressed that testing of asymptomatic people will be essential to getting a handle on the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The virus seems to be primarily spread person-to-person between those who are in close contact and through respiratory droplets produced when someone with the infection coughs or sneezes, according to the CDC. Those droplets can land in mouths and noses of those nearby or be inhaled into the lungs.</p>
<p>More than 930,000 infections have been reported across the United States and the national death toll stands around 54,000. Globally, more than 203,000 deaths have been attributed to the virus.</p>
