<h1>Obituary: Yvonne Powell Atkinson | Teacher touched students lives for nearly 50 years</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Yvonne Atkinson left an indelible mark on the young lives she touched.</p>
<p>An early childhood educator in Erie and Pittsburgh for nearly 50 years, Ms. Atkinson had a unique ability to connect to children —&nbsp;especially toddlers.</p>
<p>“She was attuned with children in a way I’ve never seen before,” said Jane Werner, executive director of the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh, where Ms. Atkinson worked for 15 years as director of Early Childhood Education until her retirement in 2017.</p>
<p>Ms. Atkinson, 72, of Erie, died Monday of COVID-19.</p>
<p>She grew up as an only child in Beltzhoover, graduating in 1966 from South Hills High School.</p>
<p>Ms. Atkinson earned a bachelor’s degree in Art three years later from Edinboro University, where she met Harold Atkinson. The couple wed, but the marriage didn’t last, said her son Darren Atkinson.</p>
<p>“They got divorced when I was 3 years old, but they remained close friends and my dad would go down to Pittsburgh to visit her and make sure she was okay,” said their son, 46, a barber in Erie. “They got closer during the past few years and they actually remarried last year.”</p>
<p>Sadly, the newlywed’s time together was cut short when Ms. Atkinson and her husband were diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, along with their son. Darren and Harold Atkinson are recovering.</p>
<p>After graduating from Edinboro, Ms. Atkinson worked at the MLK Center in Erie, first as a teacher then eventually as director of childcare, a post she held for many years.</p>
<p>“That was when she started working with kids,” her son said.</p>
<p>In 1998, Ms. Atkinson returned to Pittsburgh to work as Director of Childcare Information Services for Allegheny County.</p>
<p>Four years later, she came to the Children’s Museum, where her talent was appreciated by parents and caregivers, who voted “Ms. Yvonne” —&nbsp;as she was known by the kids —&nbsp;as the top “early childhood educator that can change your family’s life,” in a poll conducted by Kidsburgh in 2015.</p>
<p>The “Tot-Time” program she developed also won national recognition for its blend of sensory play, music and movement, especially the “Shake Your Sillies Out,” dance.</p>
<p>Though toddlers can be notoriously challenging to work with as they undergo major motor and intellectual changes, Ms. Atkinson had an effortless ability to relate to them.</p>
<p>“The kids just adored her,” Ms. Werner said. “She was a lot like Fred Rogers —&nbsp;she was a genuinely sweet and loving person, and kids sensed it right away. That was Yvonne; she just zeroed in on kids and she got them. She understood what they were talking about and she took them seriously.”</p>
<p>Her kindergarten readiness program, eye examinations for kids from underserved communities and healthy smiles program, also provided an example for younger educators, Ms. Werner said.</p>
<p>“She was a mentor to countless early childhood educators who would work as interns,” she said.</p>
<p>Her colleagues and students weren’t the only ones who noticed.</p>
<p>“She modeled such good mothering, just taking the time to be with your child. And she took time with every child,” Ms. Werner said. “She was warm and caring.”</p>
<p>Ms. Atkinson’s son can attest to his mother’s gift.</p>
<p>“She was the best,” he said. “I was an only child, so everything was focused on me. She gave me discipline and raised me to be a good, honest person.”</p>
<p>Growing up, he remembers his mother also as an artist who painted murals in their home and made beautiful pottery.</p>
<p>And, she was a patient woman, Darren Atkinson said.</p>
<p>“I can remember sleepovers with my friends and cousins and she always treated everyone like they were her kid,” he said. “She was everything to me.”</p>
<p>Ms. Atkinson often brought along her mother, Mattie Powell, to the Children’s Museum, which enthralled the children, Ms. Werner said. When she retired in 2017, Ms. Atkinson moved to Erie to care for her mother, who died only months later.</p>
<p>“Mattie was just as much a part of the museum family, too. She was lovely,” Ms. Werner recalled.</p>
<p>Though it got harder for Ms. Atkinson to get around —&nbsp;a double knee replacement and back problems necessitated using a motorized scooter during the past few years —&nbsp;her love for the children never eroded.</p>
<p>“When she was with kids she would light up, she would actually just light up,” Ms. Werner said. “I will always remember her in the nursery, being so delighted with the children. She was a very wonderful and special person.”</p>
<p>Along with her husband and son, Ms. Atkinson is survived by her father James Powell, of the North Side; her sister Maria Scott, of the North Side; and three grandchildren.</p>
<p>Her funeral was Saturday.</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers, memorial donations are suggested to the <a href="https://pittsburghkids.org/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Children's Museum</a>.</p>
