<h1>Race discrimination suit against state trooper can proceed, federal appellate court rules</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A federal appellate court has ruled that a black man from Pittsburgh who drove 10 miles on Route 28 with another man clinging to the hood of his car can resume his federal race discrimination suit against a state trooper who arrested him.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday ruled in favor of Dwayne Harvard, 46, who claimed the trooper, Christopher Cesnalis, arrested him because he's black.</p>
<p>The decision reverses a ruling by U.S. District Judge Joy Flowers Conti, who had dismissed the suit on summary judgment.</p>
<p>The wild April 2015 incident in New Kensington that led to the arrest and suit started when Mr. Harvard offered to give a ride to a woman, Anna Mazzetti, during a violent domestic dispute between her and her white boyfriend, Steven Sutton.</p>
<p>Mr. Harvard had left a bar when Ms. Mazzetti flagged him down for a ride, saying she was afraid her boyfriend was going to attack her.</p>
<p>She got into Mr. Harvard's SUV when Mr. Sutton appeared and yelled at her to get out of the car, hurled racial insults at Mr. Harvard, threatened to throw a cinderblock through the windshield and said he would kill Ms. Mazzetti with a kitchen knife he was brandishing, according to the original complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Sutton left to go to this house and "get something." Mr. Harvard called 911 to explain that he was in fear and drove away. He said Mr. Sutton reappeared and jumped on the hood of his SUV. He drove out onto Route 28 with Mr. Sutton clinging to the hood, holding the knife and making threats. Mr. Harvard said he slowed down to let Mr. Sutton climb off the car, but he refused.</p>
<p>As Mr. Harvard drove, the 911 dispatcher told him to get off at an exit where police would be waiting. He ended up driving 10 miles with Mr. Sutton on the hood. During the drive, he said, Mr. Sutton discarded the knife.</p>
<p>Police ordered everyone out of the vehicle and handcuffed Mr. Sutton.</p>
<p>Trooper Cesnalis arrived and, told that Mr. Harvard had called 911, asked him if he had been drinking and ordered him to blow into a Breathalyzer. Mr. Harvard's blood-alcohol level was lower than the legal driving limit, the judges wrote, but Trooper Cesnalis arrested him, according to the suit.</p>
<p>Mr. Sutton had told the trooper that Mr. Harvard had hit him with the SUV and knocked him onto the hood. The trooper arrested Mr. Harvard despite the fact that Ms. Mazzetti supported Mr. Harvard's story and not her boyfriend's.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also alleged that Trooper Cesnalis falsely reported that Mr. Sutton had told him he had seen Mr. Harvard smoking crack while driving.</p>
<p>The trooper filed charges against Mr. Harvard of simple and aggravated assault, DUI, reckless driving and reckless endangerment.</p>
<p>Judge Marjorie Rendell, writing for the three-judge panel, said the trooper omitted several exculpatory facts from his affidavit, including that Mr. Harvard had initiated the 911 call because he feared for his safety or that he followed instructions to proceed to the roadblock. The affidavit also did not include statements from Mr. Harvard or Ms. Mazzetti that Mr. Sutton was violent, aggressive and armed.</p>
<p>Judge Rendell wrote that "we must determine whether a reasonable juror could, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Harvard, find that the defendants acted with malice or for a purpose other than bringing Harvard to justice. Considering Cesnalisâ€™s behavior, the answer is yes. Cesnalis mischaracterized the events and chose to omit crucial exculpatory information in the affidavit of probable cause he submitted to the magistrate judge."</p>
<p>Mr. Harvard was acquitted on all charges and filed suit, saying the police investigation was racially biased against him. Judge Conti sided with the police, saying no reasonable juror would conclude that Trooper Cesnalis did not have probable cause to arrest Mr. Harvard.</p>
<p>The 3rd Circuit judges disagreed.</p>
<p>Judge Rendell said a reasonable juror could conclude that Mr. Harvard's arrest was not justified.</p>
<p>She said that a juror could also find that there was no basis for the trooper to believe Mr. Sutton over Mr. Harvard "except upon the basis of Harvard's race."</p>
<p>The circuit judges said they will vacate Judge Conti's grant of summary judgment for Trooper Cesnalis as to claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and Equal Protection claims. The judges said they will affirm Judge Conti's summary judgment ruling for the trooper on claims of reckless investigation and conspiracy.</p>
<p>The case will now return to Judge Conti.</p>
