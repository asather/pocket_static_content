The Panthers have won ACC championships the past three seasons and spent a good chunk of the 2019 campaign ranked in the top five. Their No. 6 overall seed in the NCAA tournament was the best in the program’s history.&nbsp;</p><p>Their dream season ended with an upset loss against Cincinnati in the tournament’s second round Dec. 8, but it featured far more highlights, including an upset of rival Penn State on Sept. 20 that marked Pitt’s first win in Happy Valley since 1980.&nbsp;</p><p>Pittsburgh noticed, too. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2019/09/22/pitt-penn-state-rivalry-volleyball-ncaa-pittsburgh/stories/201909220190" target="_blank">More than 5,000 fans</a> turned out for the home match against Penn State two days later.&nbsp;</p><p>Now the ACC coach of the year in 2017 and ’18 is excited about continuing that growth in the years ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>“I am grateful to chancellor Patrick Gallagher and Heather Lyke for their enduring support and investment in the future of the volleyball program,” Fisher said. “I’m honored to lead this team, as Pittsburgh has become a home to me. We have built something special over the last seven years, and we will continue our pursuit of excellence.”</p><p><em>Adam Bittner: abittner@post-gazette.com and Twitter @fugimaster24.&nbsp;</em></p></body></html>
