<p>Former “Ink Master” star and tattoo artist Daniel Silva was arrested after he attempted to flee the scene of a car crash that killed YouTube star Corey La Barrie.</p>
<p>The popular tattoo artist lost control of a 2020 McLaren 600LT Sunday night in Los Angeles while driving with La Barrie, who was celebrating his 25th birthday. Silva ran off the road and hit a tree in North Hollywood, Los Angeles police said.</p>
<p>La Barrie was transported to a hospital where he died. Silva was also transported to the hospital where he was being treated for a broken hip.</p>
<p>Silva has been booked on suspicion of murder in La Barrie’s death. Silva was reportedly drinking before the crash, which occurred while he was driving the car at a high rate of speed. A police statement characterized the crash as a DUI fatal traffic collision.</p>
<p>Silva “attempted to leave the scene but was stopped by citizens who came to render aid," police said.</p>
<p>Silva — who appeared on Season 10 of "Ink Master," a Paramount Network reality TV competition for tattoo artists — is being held on $2 million bail, the Los Angeles Police Department said.</p>
<p>Jarrad La Barrie, Corey La Barrie's brother, confirmed his death on Instagram.</p>
<p>"This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, I don't how I'm suppose to do this without you," Jarrad La Barrie wrote. "I miss you so much already, this isn't fair."</p>
<p>In his post, Jarrad La Barrie said his brother died in a car crash with "a drunk friend."</p>
<p>Corey La Barrie had more than 330,000 subscribers on YouTube and 200,000 followers on Instagram, People reported. Earlier Sunday, he had been celebrating his birthday online "while listening to 2 Chainz "Birthday Song" and drinking champagne," according to the magazine.</p>
