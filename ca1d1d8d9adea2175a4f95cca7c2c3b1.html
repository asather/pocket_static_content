<h1>Councilwoman, mayor to introduce bill to fight housing discrimination in Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Erika Strassburger, Mayor Bill Peduto, community leaders and representatives of the city’s Commission on Human Relations are planning to introduce a new bill at a Zoom press conference Tuesday that would further protect against housing discrimination.</p>
<p>Ms. Strassburger, who is sponsoring the bill, said the Human Relations commission has experienced an ‘uptick’ of complaints since the pandemic began regarding experiences where landlords have denied a person housing based on their perceived immigration or citizenship status.</p>
<p>Once introduced to council, Ms. Strassburger said there will be a preliminary vote on May 6 and a final vote on May 12. She said she already has two co-sponsor requests from Councilmen Corey O’Connor and Bobby Wilson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Strassburger said her first instinct was to push back the date of the bill’s introduction to wait until operations became “slightly more normal.” That changed when Megan Stanley, the executive director of the Human Relations commission, told her the bill is more important now than ever. Ms. Stanley told the councilwoman that discrimination — specifically against the Asian population — has been more prevalent during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard from other people’s experiences just how painful it is to be the new scapegoat, the new victim of the racism that already exists in this country,” Ms. Strassburger said. “It’s really easy for some people to scapegoat one particular race or ethnicity, and that’s what’s happening. I know there are some people out there who feel like it’s not safe or comfortable or welcomed wearing a mask looking Asian. Or, if they’re speaking a different language, they’re going to be looked at a certain way.”</p>
<p>While Ms. Strassburger said this form of discrimination in housing has long been an issue, her bill will provide a finer point in addressing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We want to get it on the books so that we have a way to report discrimination beyond just discrimination based on national origin ... ,” she said. She wants people to know “that you do not have to put up with and accept discrimination when it comes to trying to get housing or use a public place that other members of the public can freely access.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on how to file a complaint, those interested can go to <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/chr/" target="_blank">https://pittsburghpa.gov/chr/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The press conference will be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/539290160065298/" target="_blank">livestreamed</a>&nbsp;at 9 a.m. Tuesday before council’s regularly scheduled meeting. An opportunity to submit questions will be held after hearing from the speakers.&nbsp;</p>
