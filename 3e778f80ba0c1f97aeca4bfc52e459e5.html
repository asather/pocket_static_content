<p>As White House lawyers are set to close out their defense of President Donald Trump in his impeachment trial on Tuesday — and the last chance for Mr. Trump’s counsel to convince senators they should vote to acquit the president —&nbsp;it appears the Senate is moving closer to voting to approve a deal to call witnesses.</p>
<p>During an eight-hour session on Monday, the defense team cast the House Democrats’ impeachment effort as a partisan exercise that lowers the bar for future impeachments.</p>
<p>The lawyers also spent hours discussing Hunter Biden’s involvement in Ukraine. They argued Mr. Biden defied long-standing conflict of interest and corruption concerns while sitting on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm, while his father, Vice President Joe Biden, pushed for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating that company.</p>
<p>Yet the lawyers virtually ignored what could be the most significant development in the trial. On Sunday, The New York Times reported John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, knew the president froze nearly $400 million in military aid specifically to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens.</p>
<p>Here are developments happening on Tuesday:</p>

<p><strong>White House hopes to close arguments ‘by dinner time’</strong></p>
<p>White House defense lawyers will have one last chance to convince senators to acquit President Donald Trump in his impeachment trial — and they intend to do so using roughly 15 hours of their allotted 24 hours of arguments.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to be finished by dinner time,” White House Counsel Pat A. Cipollone told senators.</p>
<p>The presentations, which will continue to argue for Mr. Trump’s innocence and frame House Democrats’ efforts as a partisan witch hunt — come amid a behind-the-scenes scramble among senators.</p>
<p>It appears more likely that the Senate will vote to approve some sort of deal to call witnesses, especially after a book draft from John Bolton, former national security advisor, reportedly implicated Mr. Trump in a pressure campaign in Ukraine.</p>
<p>On Monday, several moderate Republicans, including Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said Mr. Bolton’s claims make a stronger case for witnesses.</p>
<p>Even Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., an influential conservative was open to crafting a “one-for-one” deal on witnesses, according to multiple sources. His office has not commented.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called on the White House to provide the Senate with a copy Mr. Bolton's book draft.</p>
<p>“I am encouraging the White House, anybody that I can talk to, to say: That manuscript is pertinent, and we should get access to that manuscript to see what they're actually saying,” Mr. Lankford said in a video posted to Facebook on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At least four Senate Republicans would have to join all 47 Senate Democrats to approve a resolution to call witnesses. That decision is expected on Friday, after two days of questioning by senators.</p>
