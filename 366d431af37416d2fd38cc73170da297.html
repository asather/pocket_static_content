<h1>A slipper contest, a game of Two Truths and a Lie: the quirky ways companies are keeping the joy in work relationships</h1>

<p>Almost as soon as Rand Corp.’s Pittsburgh office shifted mainly to stay-at-home work in March, the emails began to flood Catherine Augustine’s inbox, with employees searching for something — anything — to make the new circumstances somewhat resemble the old.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of desperation to continue to be connected,” said Ms. Augustine, the director of the research-based nonprofit’s Pittsburgh location.</p>
<p>So she began to use the Microsoft Teams software to replicate the office dynamic in a strange new world in which a house became more than a home — a de facto school, workplace and playground all in one. The program allowed her to create channels for employees to share pictures of their pets or home office setup, quirky talents or favorite songs.</p>
<p>It’s imperfect.</p>
<p>But in an imperfect situation, Rand and other companies across the Pittsburgh area are making the most with what they have —&nbsp;converting water cooler talk into a virtual medium, offering people a sense of togetherness during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“Part of the joy of working is your colleagues,” said Dana Gold, the chief operating officer of Jewish Family and Community Services (JFCS) in Pittsburgh. “Without that, when we’re isolated at home, it’s sometimes difficult to enjoy your work as much as you would if you were in the office. So this gives everyone the opportunity to still enjoy one another, to stay informed, to share best practices.”</p>
<p>When JFCS first moved into a teleworking capacity, Ms. Gold began sending out an email each morning to the staff, with topics ranging from jokes to alleviate stress to advice on how to effectively work from home. That’s just the tip of the iceberg, though.</p>
<p>JFCS has used Slack messaging to share photos, gather songs from employees to create a summer playlist and play the game of Two Truths and a Lie over email.</p>
<p>The book club created before the pandemic has shifted online (and an anti-racism book group has also begun), one department started to meet virtually for half-hour gripe sessions when the goings got especially tough, and JFCS once held a slipper contest —&nbsp;comparing who wore the best moccasins, woolen socks or just bare feet.</p>
<p>“It’s just me pulling it out of the air,” Ms. Gold said.</p>
<p>One of the most popular activities at JFCS has been a scavenger hunt, with a different prompt each day challenging employees to find an item from their childhood still in their house or model their most eccentric article of clothing, for example. Then they upload it to a shared Google Drive folder.</p>
<p>And even though not everyone participates in finding that day’s requested item, Ms. Gold said almost everyone enjoys looking at those silly pictures.</p>
<p>JFCS also has a few therapists on staff, and one has experience in art therapy. For the staff, all they need is something to draw on — a sidewalk with chalk, a pen and paper — to take a momentary break, releasing pent-up stress.</p>
<p>At Guttman Energy, located in Belle Vernon, the staff has used Yammer as its internal social media page, posting photos of a recent trip or a child’s graduation. In addition, there have been virtual happy hours and Feel Good Announcements emailed out each Friday, ways to keep coworkers engaged.</p>
<p>“We post a lot of things that are going on within the company or personal stuff because we miss the water cooler talk, basically,” said Pam Corn, the director of marketing at Guttman Energy.</p>
<p>Back when more work was done in the office, Guttman Energy held weekly lunches for employees and executives to get to know each other in an informal way. Ms. Corn said they’ve tried to keep that going, scaling back to once per month over a video call.</p>
<p>“They can sit there and ask whatever questions they want,” Ms. Corn said. “Sometimes they just talk about sports the whole time, they talk about vacations or something like that. Very, very low key, and people love it. And it gives us a way for the employees and executives to connect.”</p>
<p>At Rand’s Pittsburgh office, Ms. Augustine said the need for connectivity is twofold. The events planned are important avenues to feel camaraderie, such as a virtual presentation from an employee about night sky photography and a 20-mile bike ride around the city to celebrate the company’s 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>But as a research organization, employees often rely on networking in the office to find new projects.</p>
<p>“Having that connection is for Rand more than just overcoming loneliness and isolation,” Ms. Augustine said. “It’s also part of our DNA. We need to be networking with each other in order to have a successful organization.”</p>
<p>In a world turned upside down in many ways — with dining room tables working as makeshift desks — Pittsburgh-area companies are making do with the resources at their disposal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re continuing to just work as we always work, but try to bring that into the virtual environment,” Ms. Gold said. “So, a lot of creativity, but also just a lot of attention to employees as human beings.”</p>
