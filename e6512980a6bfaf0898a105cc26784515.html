<h1>Steelers are canceling and refunding individual ticket purchases for 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Word has been trickling in for some season ticket holders and others who purchased seats for specific Steelers games that those transactions have been voided.</p>
<p>Due to the team currently planning for reduced capacity at Heinz Field for the 2020 season, fans who bought single-game tickets through Ticketmaster and other third-party sites are being informed that the sale has been canceled and that they will be refunded.</p>
<p>“We will be making adjustments to our seating configuration at Heinz Field this year to allow for social distancing,” Burt Lauten, Steelers director of communications, said in a statement. “That ultimately mandated all individual ticket purchases to be canceled and refunded. We are working through scenarios for limited-capacity plans to provide options for our season ticket holders to attend games this year.</p>
<p>“We greatly appreciate the support and understanding of our fans under these circumstances.”</p>
<p>While this is no surprise given the ongoing alterations being made by the NFL and other sports leagues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is another sign that the 2020 football season will be unlike any other — and anything but normal. Single-game seats for Steelers home dates are no longer for sale at Ticketmaster, the official partner of the NFL, or other popular vendors such as StubHub and VividSeats. The only game on their 2020 schedule that still exists for sales on Ticketmaster is the Nov. 8 game at Dallas.</p>
<p>Season ticket holders who opted to resell or transfer their seats for games in 2020 also were informed via email that those transactions have been canceled. Those who deferred their season tickets for this year will be refunded or credited.</p>
<p>“If you have not deferred your season ticket package, once capacity and seating configurations are finalized, we will provide additional details regarding how your seat location may be affected for the 2020 season only,” the email reads.</p>
