<h1>Cordan Hondru, standout Peters Township linebacker, commits to Miami (Ohio)</h1>

<p>When the college football recruiting process started for Corban Hondru, he didn’t know much about Miami University (Ohio).</p>
<p>“I did know it was Big Ben’s alma mater,” Hondru said with a laugh, referring to the Steelers quarterback.</p>
<p>But he learned plenty about Miami during the past year, and now he knows it’s where he wants to play college football.</p>
<p>Hondru, a junior inside linebacker at Peters Township High School, made a verbal commitment Friday to Miami. Hondru (6 feet 1, 220 pounds) is projected to be one of the top players in the WPIAL next season. He made the <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/fab22/2019/" target="_blank">Post-Gazette Fabulous 22 in 2019</a> after having 10 sacks and 16 tackles for loss on a team that made it to the WPIAL Class 5A championship.</p>
<p>A few other Mid-American Conference schools (Ball State and Bowling Green) and Pennsylvania and Lehigh were among others that also were at the top of Hondru’s list.</p>
<p>“I knew I wanted to commit early,” Hondru said. “I was looking at all the boxes, and Miami filled those boxes. So I figured, why wait? Why risk on not going there, just in case the (scholarship) spots would fill up.”</p>
<p>Miami won the MAC championship a year ago. When asked exactly what boxes Miami checks, Hondru said, “It’s a winning football program now and it’s a beautiful campus with a great college life. There are great coaches that will push me to be the best I can be and there are great teammates.”</p>
<p>Hondru is one of two Peters Township juniors who have offers from Football Bowl Subdivision schools. The other is defensive back Donovan McMillon, who is turning out to be one of the most heavily recruited players in the WPIAL class of 2021. Last weekend, McMillon announced on Twitter his list of 15 favorites. Among them are Pitt, Penn State, Michigan, Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Michigan State.</p>
<p>Although schools are shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic and sports teams can’t practice or have team workouts, Hondru is trying to stay in shape by lifting weights and working out in his basement.</p>
<p>“Sometimes there might be four of us go to a friend’s house and work out there,” Hondru said. “Some of the football guys, we might go find a field somewhere and just do some agility drills and play some offense and defense.”</p>
<p>Of course, the majority of Hondru’s time is spent at home, sometimes watching movies or playing board games with his family.</p>
<p>“We played the game Clue,” Hondru said with a laugh. “I like to look at the positive side of things. This lets you spend more time with your families.”</p>
