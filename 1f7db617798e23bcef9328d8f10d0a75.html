<p>If you were to Google search&nbsp;“coronavirus funny tweets,” you would find headlines like&nbsp;“24 relatable tweets about love in the time of coronavirus,” from <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/funny-coronavirus-tweets-love-marriage_l_5e73a0c4c5b6eab77943fa0c" target="_blank">HuffPost</a>; or&nbsp;“Coronaviral: the best memes, tweets and cartoons to get you through” from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/18/coronaviral-the-best-memes-tweets-and-cartoons-to-get-you-through-open-thread" target="_blank">the Guardian</a>, as dozens of publications pick up on the wave of social media jokes during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Just this past January, Twitter exploded with “World War III” memes after the U.S. sent an airstrike that killed a top Iranian general in Iraq — a situation that would be uncomfortable to joke about in a face-to-face conversation, yet somehow #WWIII was trending on social media for days.</p>

<p>Months later, as the world attempts to cope with the seriousness of a viral infection that has put millions of lives on hold, Twitter, Tik Tok, Facebook and Instagram users find new ways each day to go viral themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A scroll through your Twitter timeline would bring about themes of concern through humor, plays on words like users calling the virus&nbsp;“The Roni,” cultural references as they pertain to the virus, and jokes about booking a cheap flight as airlines struggle with low travel demands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the jokes and GIFs bring laughs and smiles during a time based in extreme anxiety for most, the question remains: Why are we like this?</p>
<p>Why do thousands of people use social media platforms as a way to collectively joke about very serious global events?</p>
<p>Monica Riordan, cognitive psychologist at Chatham University said the answer is simple —&nbsp;it’s science.</p>
<p>“GIFs, memes, posts, and tweets that delight us or make us smile, releasing feelings of pleasure, cause our brains to release dopamine,” Ms. Riordan told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Friday.&nbsp;“Dopamine release is an evolutionary signal to keep seeking more of that thing — and we get lost in pages upon pages of GIFs, memes, tweets (whatever your social media pleasure) — looking for that dopamine release.”</p>
<p>Ms. Riordan, who studies computer-mediated communication, said humans crave releases of dopamine — a neurotransmitter that plays a role in how people feel pleasure — when times are dark and they’re feeling sad or depressed. That directly causes social media users to actively seek content that helps create a happier feeling through the universal language of humor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another internal motivation at play while participating in witty social media banter is the response users get from thousands of other people on any given platform that allows them to experience social approval, Ms. Riordan said. The&nbsp;tenured professor who has been working at Chatham the last eight years&nbsp;said approval is a strong reinforcement for behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are motivated to create comic relief on social media, driven by getting likes and upvotes and laughing emojis and new followers or friends,” Ms. Riordan explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why is it easier for some people to communicate through graphics, photos, videos and illustrations instead of expressing emotions such as fear or concern through written text? Ms. Riordan said it’s related to how accessible a GIF is on the internet when you need it, where as it may be harder to find the exact words you want to say.</p>
<p>“GIFs and memes are useful for expressing what is difficult to express in words, such as pumping a fist in victory,” she said. “And because they are user-generated from freely available content, they can be created at any time using any picture or video, capturing life as it happens and disseminating it across the globe.”</p>
<p>That rapid dissemination creates a snowball affect. When social media users see another engaging in funny content on the platform, it triggers that user to want to join in on the fun in hopes to receive the same reaction, a&nbsp;phenomenon that researchers call&nbsp;“emotional contagion.”</p>
<p>“Emotional contagion [is]&nbsp;the tendency of individuals to align their own emotion with those of others, such that emotion spreads through a network,” Ms. Riordan explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more a user sees humorous content, no matter the level of seriousness surrounding the subject, that moment of joy catches on and people instinctually pass it on.</p>
<p>“Applied to social media, as we spread humor via memes and GIFs and tweets to others on social media, they spread it to another set of others, who spread it to another set of others, making content go viral,” Ms. Riordan said. “Kind of like a coronavirus!”</p>
