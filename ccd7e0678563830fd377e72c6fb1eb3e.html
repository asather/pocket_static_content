<h1>Kennywood and Sandcastle postpone reopening amid Allegheny County COVID-19 spike</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kennywood and Sandcastle Waterpark on Thursday postponed their July 6 openings after Allegheny County announced new restrictions amid rising cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>A new reopening date was not announced.</p>
<p>The postponement comes after new guidelines from the county&nbsp;that restrict events of more than 25 people for at least one week beginning Friday. Those mitigation efforts came after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/02/COVID-19-coronavirus-Allegheny-County-Western-Pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-200/stories/202007020115" target="_blank">record numbers of new COVID-19 cases</a>, with the county reporting 233 new cases Thursday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We believe strongly in the plan developed by our teams at Kennywood and Sandcastle to best protect the health and safety of all those visiting and working at our parks,” a <a href="https://www.kennywood.com/summer2020" target="_blank">release</a> from the park reads. “We will continue to work towards opening this summer as soon as safely possible and providing the clean, safe and fun experience we have been proud to provide for the Greater Pittsburgh Area since 1898.”</p>
<p>Kennywood and Sandcastle, along with sister park Idlewild &amp; SoakZone, were set to do a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/recreation/2020/06/10/Sandcastle-kennywood-idlewild-reopen-July-11-summer-waterpark-amusement-parks-pittsburgh/stories/202006100074" target="_blank">phased reopening</a> on July 6 before fully opening to the public July 11 with new safety guidelines. Idlewild &amp; SoakZone, which is located in Westmoreland County near&nbsp;Ligonier, has not postponed its reopening.</p>
<p>Westmoreland County reported 36 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday.</p>

<p>Kennywood recently <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/recreation/2020/06/23/Kennywood-Park-cancels-fall-events/stories/202006230083" target="_blank">canceled its fall events</a>, including Phantom Fright Nights and Happy Hauntings, due to concerns about the novel coronavirus. However, the park still plans to have the park open&nbsp;in the fall with limited hours on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The county’s mitigation efforts also include&nbsp;the closure of bars, restaurants and casinos for a week starting Friday at 12:01 a.m.&nbsp;Allegheny County Health Department director Dr. Debra Bogen&nbsp;recommended residents stay home to prevent the virus’ spread.</p>
