<h1>Pirates season-ticket holders have two options in 2020: commit or refund</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pirates season-ticket holders who were wondering what would happen to their tickets given the parameters of the 2020 MLB season have been given a couple of options: Commit to the 2021 season or receive a refund.</p>
<p>“At this time, it remains unclear if PNC Park will be able to host our loyal and dedicated fans during the 2020 season,” <a href="https://www.mlb.com/pirates/fans/2020-updates?partnerId=sf124995802&amp;sf124995802=1" target="_blank">reads a fact sheet</a> the Pirates released Tuesday evening. “We remain in constant contact with the health experts, governmental officials and league representatives as we consider numerous ideas that will allow us to host fans in a safe manner this season.”</p>
<p>That first of the two options allows Pirates fans to roll over the complete value of their 2020 season tickets to next year — assuming, of course, the 2021 season is unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Choosing to do so will come with a few perks, including a 15% bonus ticket credit “for every dollar rolled over,” a complimentary seat upgrade for a 2021 game of your choice and locking in other “exclusive 2021 season-ticket benefits.”</p>
<p>Fans also have the option of receiving a full or partial refund for all 2020 games from June to September as long as they complete a survey that will be emailed out “in the coming days.”</p>
<p>There is a deadline of July 31 for completing that survey; otherwise, your remaining 2020 season-ticket value will automatically roll over to 2021. In other words, if you would rather get a refund for this year’s tickets, you have a little over three weeks to make that happen.</p>
<p>The fact sheet on the Pirates’ website recommends that fans reach out to their season-ticket account manager with any lingering questions. Other information about how to use that 15% bonus credit, what to do with both group and individual tickets purchased for 2020 games, suite holder leases and more are answered <a href="https://www.mlb.com/pirates/fans/2020-updates?partnerId=sf124995802&amp;sf124995802=1" target="_blank">on that fact sheet</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Clint Hurdle selling $1.8 million Hampton home</strong></p>
<p>It’s been a little more than nine months since <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/09/29/pittsburgh-pirates-manager-clint-hurdle-fired-neal-huntington/stories/201909290175" target="_blank">Clint Hurdle was fired</a> after nine seasons as the Pirates’ manager.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what his next professional move will be, but the next&nbsp;personal one for Hurdle and his wife, Karla, appears to be selling their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/3005-Whispering-Creek-Dr_Allison-Park_PA_15101_M45010-06104#photo23" target="_blank">$1.8 million luxury home</a> in Hampton.</p>
<p>This slick video dropped recently by the Arlene Guastella Group showcasing the house’s many features has a few dead giveaways that either someone affiliated with the Pirates or a Pittsburgh baseball super fan owned it. See if you can spot them.</p>

<p>Yes, that is a giant Pirates logo on that basketball court.</p>
<p>Hurdle is just the latest former or current Pittsburgh sports figure to provide a rare look into how they live. Last summer, we all got a look at the quirky stuff in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/07/24/phil-kessel-house-sale-realtor-price-photos-pittsburgh-penguins/stories/201907240109" target="_blank">ex-Penguin Phill Kessel’s</a> and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/08/05/ben-roethlisberger-mansion-for-sale-hampton-pittsburgh/stories/201908050118" target="_blank">Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s</a> not-so-humble abodes.</p>
<p>In October, former Steeler Antonio Brown’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/10/22/antoino-brown-home-for-sale-pittsburgh/stories/201910220140" target="_blank">$2.3 million mansion</a> complete with a two-story tree house went on the market. And more recently, Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier offered a window into the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/Buying-Here/2020/07/03/Ryan-Shazier-house-Fox-Chapel-Tull-Pittsburgh-Steelers-Ramp-n-Rize/stories/202007030030" target="_blank">$2.95 million Fox Chapel home</a> he was putting up for sale.</p>
<p>None of those homes, including Hurdle’s, are anywhere near as weird as the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/homes/2020/05/19/Plum-house-castle-starship-jungle-room-Pittsburgh-Twitter/stories/202005190051" target="_blank">$159,000 sci-fi wasteland in Plum</a> that immediately went viral when it was listed on Zillow in May. Do yourself a favor and check that one out if you want a chuckle.</p>
