<h1>Man who survived 2016 Wilkinsburg mass shooting dies</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man who survived the mass shooting in Wilkinsburg in 2016 died on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>John Ellis, 51, of McKees Rocks was injured along with two others in the shooting at a cookout that left five adults and one unborn child dead.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellis was pronounced dead at UPMC Mercy Hospital at 2:13 p.m. after being taken to the hospital for complications, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office said.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellis was shot while sitting in a chair in the backyard of the house on the 1300 block of Franklin Avenue where the shooting occurred in March 2016. He lived next door and stopped by the house to get something to eat.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellis, who used a wheelchair after the shooting, said he suffered a spinal injury that paralyzed him from the waist down and that doctors told him he probably wouldn’t be able to walk again.</p>
<p>“They said I’m not, but in my mind I’m going to,” Mr. Ellis told&nbsp;Post-Gazette reporter Liz Navratil&nbsp;in June 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February, a jury found Cheron Shelton, the lone defendant in the case, not guilty of murder.</p>
