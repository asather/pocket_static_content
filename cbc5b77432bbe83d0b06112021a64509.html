<p>SUNRISE, Fla. — John Marino’s stellar rookie season is being put on ice.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old defenseman has three broken bones in his left cheek after taking a slap shot to the face in Thursday’s 4-2 loss in Tampa Bay and is expected to have surgery, according to a source. It’s unclear how long Marino will be out.</p>
<p>Late in the third period Thursday, after Marino scored to pull the Penguins within a goal, Lightning forward Steven Stamkos ripped a one-timer from the left circle that hit Zach Aston-Reese’s stick and ramped up into Marino’s cheek.</p>
<p>When the whistle blew, players from both teams waved for an athletic trainer to come take a look at Marino, who lay face-first down on the ice. After about 30 seconds, Marino got up on his skates and was helped off the ice by head athletic trainer Chris Stewart. Marino went to the locker room and did not return.</p>
<p>Immediately after the game, coach Mike Sullivan said Marino was still being evaluated. Late Thursday, the Penguins believed that Marino, who needed to get stitches at Amalie Arena, had somehow escaped without a major injury.</p>
<p>But Friday morning, after the Penguins arrived in Sunrise, Fla. for a practice at BB&amp;T Center, further testing revealed the extent of Marino’s damage.</p>
<p>The team had no comment after Sullivan told reporters around 1 p.m. Friday that Marino was being further evaluated “for precautionary reasons.” The coach is scheduled to talk before Saturday’s game against the Florida Panthers.</p>
<p>According to the Cleveland Clinic, the treatment and recovery time for multiple cheekbone fractures “depend on the location and extent of the injury.” But if he does indeed have surgery, Marino would likely miss at least several games.</p>
<p>It’s the latest blow to a Penguins team that has already overcome absences from Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, Kris Letang, Jake Guentzel, Bryan Rust and…</p>
<p>… actually, it might just be easier to list the guys who haven’t gotten hurt.</p>
<p>Brian Dumoulin, another important blue liner, has also been out of commission since Nov. 30 and does not appear to be on track to return imminently.</p>
<p>Marino helped the Penguins keep rolling despite injuries on the blue line. He had settled into a top-four role and was seeing time on both special-teams units. The Harvard product has five goals, 20 assists and a plus-14 rating through his first 51 games and has averaged more than 20 minutes of ice time per game.</p>
<p>The Penguins acquired Marino from the Edmonton Oilers for a sixth-round pick last summer and persuaded him to skip his senior year at Harvard to turn pro.</p>
<p>He turned heads during training camp and the preseason with his poise, skating and sharp breakout passes. He quickly jumped over veterans Jack Johnson and Erik Gudbranson on the depth chart. Gudbranson has since been traded.</p>
<p>Marino remains one of the NHL’s most impressive rookies and has arguably been Pittsburgh’s most consistent blue liner. It appeared that he would get All-Rookie consideration, but an extended absence may hurt him, as Colorado’s Cale Makar, Vancouver’s Quinn Hughes and New York’s Adam Fox have also excelled.</p>
<p>The bigger worry is how the Penguins will get by during Marino’s absence.</p>
<p>With Dumoulin still sidelined, Johnson has been skating with All-Star Kris Letang. With Marino sitting out Friday’s practice, Marcus Pettersson and Justin Schultz were reunited. Juuso Riikola with Chad Ruhwedel formed the third pair.</p>
<p>The Penguins also need to add an able body or two from the minor leagues. Zach Trotman and Kevin Czuczman have spent time in Pittsburgh this season.</p>
<p>The Penguins wrap up their three-game road trip Saturday against the Panthers.</p>
