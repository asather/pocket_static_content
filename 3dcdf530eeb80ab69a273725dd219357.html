<h1>Pirates pitchers struggling to get deeper into games</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CINCINNATI — On Tuesday night, following the Pirates’ seventh straight loss, Joe Musgrove was asked about stopping the bleeding.</p>
<p>He had just come off a five-inning, 87-pitch outing in which he had allowed four runs in the first two innings then tightened up with three shutout innings from there.</p>
<p>In normal circumstances, he may have pitched deeper into the game, but having recently returned from the injured list, he was on an 85-pitch limit and was only allowed to surpass that because he had been cruising.</p>
<p>Every Pirate can likely do some introspection and find room for improvement right now, and Musgrove is no different. So the question of how to stop the bleeding leads him to consider how he and his fellow starters can pitch.</p>
<p>“It's hard, man, you can look at anything on a given night. One thing shows up and one thing doesn't, but looking at our numbers as starters, we only have two quality starts on the year, which is a big problem,” Musgrove said. “I don't know, we've had a lot of guys that were doing piggybacks and guys building back from injuries, so there wasn't really even an opportunity for quality starts, but ... we've got to set the tone better, and we've got to find a way to get six innings in every night, and I think that's where it's going to start, a strong pitching performance.”</p>
<p>Those two quality starts — defined as a start that goes six innings with no more than three earned runs — came from right-handers Trevor Williams and Chad Kuhl. Williams threw seven innings and allowed one earned run against the Minnesota Twins on Aug. 5. Kuhl threw six innings and allowed one earned run against the St. Louis Cardinals on Aug. 27.</p>
<p>Quality starts don’t necessarily mean a team is&nbsp;automatically successful, since a good bullpen can paper over a short outing to win a game, too, but the point for the Pirates is more that they have struggled to get their starters deep into games this season. As Musgrove said, that is a problem.</p>
<p>There is some good reason for that. Musgrove, Mitch Keller, Steven Brault and Kuhl have all been somewhat limited either by injuries either suffered during the season or previously. JT Brubaker and Cody Ponce have been limited because of moves from the bullpen to a starter’s role. That makes up six of the eight players who have started games for the Pirates this season.</p>
<p>That does not change the fact that, when healthy, the Pirates have still struggled to get deep into games.</p>
<p>“In general, there's that fine line between attacking hitters and just grooving it, and try to toe that line as much as possible,” Brault said Wednesday. “And just, in all honesty, it's just been one of those years for us. For me particularly, I haven't been able to go deep in games because I've been getting deep into counts, not finishing people early enough. I think that it will be a focus not only the rest of the season, but also in the offseason. Whatever mentally we have to change, physically we have to change, to make sure that next year we'll be more consistent with it.”</p>
<p><strong>Spring training schedule</strong></p>
<p>Hard as it may be to believe amid this COVID-19-affected season, Major League Baseball plans to have spring training in 2021. With that, the Pirates released their schedule for their months-long session in Bradenton, Fla., for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights:</p>
<p><strong>Injury updates</strong></p>
<p>General manager Ben Cherington said Tuesday that time is running short this season for a Keone Kela return.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ closer left their game on Aug. 21 with right forearm discomfort before joining the injured list shortly thereafter. Now, director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk said Kela has yet to throw off the mound, and though they haven’t given up hope completely on a return, it gets less likely with every passing day.</p>
<p>“The medical team [is] very encouraged by the overall prognosis on Keone and for his return to pitching in the near future, but unfortunately we’re running out of days in the calendar,” Tomczyk said.</p>
<p>The same is true for reliever Yacksel Rios, who has been on the injured list with shoulder inflammation since Aug. 15 after pitching in just three games with the Pirates.</p>
<p>Additionally, right-handed reliever Kyle Crick recently re-aggravated a lat strain injury that put him on the shelf earlier this season, Tomczyk said, adding that Crick’s arm simply has not recovered to the point where he could pitch in live action.</p>
<p>In more positive news, right-hander Jameson Taillon, who missed all of this season recovering from his Tommy John surgery, threw another live batting practice session Tuesday in Cincinnati. Tomczyk said Taillon is heavily lobbying for the Pirates to let him pitch this season, which would be way earlier than any projections for Taillon’s recovery would have indicated, though he added that it absolutely does not mean he will pitch in a game this year.</p>
<p>“He’s lobbying. I’m not saying we’re entertaining it, but he’s lobbying very, very hard,” Tomczyk said. “It’s not a surprise with Jameson.”</p>
