<h1>Washington Wild Things push for games with fans, but will that happen?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Major League Baseball has been stuck in a holding pattern for the past three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, mired in contract and payment negotiations that have slowed hopes that there will be a 2020 season at all.</p>
<p>In Washington County, where the Wild Things are, there is an entirely different challenge.</p>
<p>They play in the Frontier League, a professional independent baseball league made up of teams across the Northeast and Midwest regions of the U.S., plus two Canadian squads. Gov. Tom Wolf has said teams in Pennsylvania counties that are now in the yellow or green phase of his reopening plan can begin practicing or playing games, provided the state&nbsp;Department of Health approves their plans for “testing or screening and monitoring of all on-venue players and personnel.”</p>
<p>But for a smaller team like the Wild Things, games without fans wouldn’t make financial sense.&nbsp;General manager Tony Buccilli has understood this for a while, and he and the Wild Things believe their 3,200-seat stadium should entitle them to be viewed in the same capacity as casinos or shopping malls, which are open for customers.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of months, they have concocted social-distancing-compliant plans for a restart to play with fans in some capacity.&nbsp;Yet Buccilli is waiting to turn his plans into practice, as there currently is no formal review process for individual businesses that believe they should be granted special exceptions by the state for one reason or another.</p>
<p>“That’s where the frustration has set in,” Buccilli said. “We’re trying to do everything and follow proper protocols. I’ve been directly in contact with the Department of Commerce and Economic Development at the regional and state level. I’ve also reached out to the health department in Allegheny County. Also the state level. Also reached out to [Pittsburgh Mayor Bill] Peduto’s office.</p>
<p>“We want to follow every protocol. We want to respect the health department’s guidelines and the state guidelines, but we also want our business to be looked at as what it is, considering everything that we have to offer. So that’s the tough thing right now is I don’t have a lot of feedback. I’m not getting a lot of answers.”</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development confirmed that there is no appeal process in place right now, while the state Department of Health told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette it is working to set up a meeting with the Wild Things to “better understand their concerns at this time.”</p>
<p>If there are no games, the Wild Things don’t have a major league club to kick down money to players or keep the organization alive for developmental reasons as an MLB-affiliated minor league team would.</p>
<p>Plus, as one might imagine, there aren’t lucrative TV deals in the Frontier League. Buccilli says the team typically aims to turn $3 million in revenue in a season, and the Wild Things “don’t make a profit ever.” Still, a season without any revenue means eating the operations cost for the year. While Buccilli says the Wild Things aren’t in danger of going under or leaving town without a season, he does fear the economic impact a lost year could have on local vendors and partners who provide products for and with the organization.</p>
<p>It’s hard to calculate an exact dollar amount on that impact, according to Washington County Chamber of Commerce president Jeff Kotula, because the effects extend to restaurants, shops and even gas stations in the area. Still, Kotula said, the team is used to advertise the county for potential tourists or business owners looking to set up shop.</p>
<p>While the prospect of a canceled season can be scary, Buccilli remains optimistic. After all, he says officials have told him his thought process is rational. The way he sees it, things people can or can’t do amid the COVID-19 pandemic change all the time, so the Wild Things could get the go-ahead at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>As he waits to hear from officials, his players and coaches wait too. The average salary for Frontier League players is just $725 a month, according to a 2018 SB Nation story, but Buccilli says they’re eager as ever to get back to playing the game, some hoping to grind their way back to MLB or the minor leagues, while others simply want to play baseball for another year.</p>
<p>While the start of the Frontier League season is technically delayed, the league is allowing its teams to proceed with games however they see fit, knowing that health and safety guidelines will differ depending on location. That could include playing non-league teams comprising free agent players, simply to have games, get fans in the ballpark and save something financially.</p>
<p>As for how the experience at Consol Energy Park might look during games, Buccilli says the Wild Things would implement a social distancing seating chart. They would utilize every other row throughout the park, with seats on the ends of the row being sold and the seats in the middle of the rows working as a natural social distancer. Tickets will be sold online only, with no in-person purchases.</p>
<p>Some of the unique parts of the ballpark, such as the party deck or the suites, will be sold to individual groups only, while the 200-300 person picnic area will likely be closed.</p>
<p>Concessions will be run similar to checkout lines in supermarkets, with placards on the ground laying out 6 feet of distance between those in line. Buccilli said they even plan on splitting the park in half and directing the first-base-side attendees to enter and exit through one gate, with the third-base-side fans entering and exiting through the other.</p>
<p>The remaining question Buccilli needs to be answered is how responsible the Wild Things are for enforcing social-distancing guidelines. Is it enough to have the new seating chart and allow fans to go from there, or must they keep a firmer thumb on attendees to ensure they’re following the rules?</p>
<p>Buccilli certainly sees it as financially important to play, but he feels just as strongly about the impact it could have on the community. MLB may or may not play games this year, and MLB-affiliated minor league season seem likely to be canceled altogether.</p>
<p>The Wild Things’ return would allow their players another opportunity to earn a salary playing the game. It would also bring back some normalcy to fans hoping to go to a ballpark again.</p>
<p>“We’re going to emphasize people to be smart. It’s not a political thing,” Buccilli said. “There is some optics to it to make sure as a business we’re doing our job and protecting those who might be vulnerable. We’re not naive to those circumstances, and we don’t want to make our ballpark an exclusive opportunity. We don’t want to say, ‘You can come to the ballpark, but these people can’t.’ We don’t want to be that type of business.</p>
<p>“So we’re going to be respectful to everybody, and I think everybody understands that, and ultimately, at the end of the day, I think everybody wants to get outside and back to a ballpark and just that outlet’s going to be a good getaway for a lot of people.”</p>
