<h1>Peduto joins calls for USDA to open grocery delivery, curbside pickup to SNAP recipients</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What happens if a person who receives government food assistance wants to use it for grocery delivery or curbside pickup in the midst of a highly contagious pandemic? The short answer is they can’t. Not in Pittsburgh, not in the rest of Pennsylvania, or even in the majority of states.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto joined other lawmakers and advocates in urging the federal government to make online grocery shopping available to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Enabling retailers to accept EBT payments through curbside pick-up, delivery, and online sales will ensure that SNAP households, one-third of which have a member who is older or has a disability, have access to healthy foods during the global pandemic without the need to leave home or visit a grocery store,”&nbsp;wrote Mr. Peduto in a letter to the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Among Pennsylvania SNAP recipients, about 688,000 are people with disabilities and 184,000 elderly, according to the state’s Department of Human Services, which administers the benefits. About 147,000 in Allegheny County receive benefits.</p>
<p>Electronic benefits transfer payment, or EBT, is similar to a debit or credit card that has the cash assistance loaded onto it.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto continued: “As an increasing number of grocery stores and other food providers offer curbside pick-up, delivery, and online ordering in the midst of the current crisis, it is more imperative than ever that SNAP participants are not left behind and can benefit from these expanding choices.”</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Bob Casey and Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, have <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/04/26/Congress-SNAP-benefits-food-stamps-online-grocery-delivery/stories/202004260008?cid=search" target="_blank">vowed to push for expanded food assistance and grocery delivery options</a> in the next round of federal COVID-19 relief.</p>
<p>“It’s a giant problem and one that we’ve been trying to get the government to fix,” said Ken Regal, executive director of Just Harvest, an anti-hunger advocacy organization.</p>
<p>SNAP recipients in Pittsburgh could use a pay-upon-pickup option offered by Giant Eagle, but unless the store has a mobile device that can process the EBT payment, the customer still needs to go inside to pay. Adding to the obstacles for SNAP recipients: the fee for curbside pickup cannot be covered by SNAP.</p>
<p>“As the use of our Giant Eagle pickup and delivery service becomes a key way we accomplish this, we join Mayor Peduto in encouraging the State of Pennsylvania and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to continue all efforts to support online EBT payment capabilities,” said Dan Donovan, director of corporate communications for the grocery chain. “In the meantime, our teams are working diligently to ensure our payment technologies are ready for this service expansion as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Instacart is an alternative for shoppers who don’t utilize Giant Eagle, but it also is off limits for SNAP participants. The national grocery delivery and pick-up service works with local retailers, including Shop&nbsp;‘n Save and Aldi, that do not offer their own services. Because it is an e-commerce company, EBT payments cannot be accepted.</p>
<p>Angela Fisher of Bloomfield learned that after she filled her online cart.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘I can’t find anywhere where I can enter my SNAP benefit information,’ ” said Ms. Fisher, a mental health professional who recently became unemployed and suffers from chronic asthma.&nbsp;“… Why is that yet another barrier? I was really disheartened by that.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instacart is in talks with the USDA about being included in the pilot program, according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p>Another worry on the horizon for anti-hunger advocates: farmer’s markets. The city is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/food/2020/04/21/COVID-19-Western-Pennsylvania-farmers-markets-local-food-delivery-CSA-Bloomfield/stories/202004130147" target="_blank">moving to an online order and pickup model for its markets</a> this season as a public health precaution.</p>
<p>“The city needs to take care of their own business on that as well as wisely pushing for USDA to take broader action on this,” said Mr. Regal, whose organization processed roughly $30,000 in EBT payments at local farmer’s markets last year.&nbsp; “... They [the city] need to make sure SNAP users are not going to be left out.”</p>
