<h1>Pirates takeaways: Steven Brault continues his strong start to season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steven Brault has the lowest ERA of any Pirates starter right now.</p>
<p>That wasn’t true going into Wednesday night’s game against the Cleveland Indians, but it was when he finished his five-inning, two-hit, no-run outing.&nbsp;In fact, his 3.00 ERA is misleading in itself. As a starter, Brault has yet to allow an earned run. The only runs he has given up were in his lone relief role.</p>
<p>On that day, Aug. 7 against the Detroit Tigers, he was bad. He relieved right-hander Chad Kuhl in the fifth inning, allowed three hits, three walks and four runs, did not record a single out and departed the game after 32 pitches.</p>
<p>If there have been limitations on Brault’s pitching, it’s physical. After suffering a shoulder strain in March, he came into summer camp still building his endurance back to normal.</p>
<p>With that, the Pirates used him and Kuhl, who was in a similar situation, in a tandem, piggyback role. One would start, throw a few innings on a certain pitch count, then give way to the other.&nbsp;That’s why, on Wednesday, despite looking extremely good, Brault was pulled after five innings and 80 pitches. Perhaps he could have gone longer if not for a 29-pitch first inning, but hindsight is 20/20.</p>
<p>“I actually intentionally went out this time without talking to [manager Derek Shelton] about how long my leash was,” Brault said. “I wanted to just go out and treat it like a normal start. And I think any time you throw 30 pitches in the first inning, no matter how stretched out you are, it’s frustrating, because you want to be efficient that first inning. To get like a 12-pitch first inning is just a great feeling.</p>
<p>“To go 30 in the first inning, that can be the sign of something bad to come or a short start. So my main focus after that inning was, ‘Hey, it’s a zero, and it’s over. And from now on, we just want to be efficient. Forget about it.’ ”</p>
<p>What was notable was Brault’s confidence with all of his pitches Wednesday. In addition to his usual four-seam fastball/slider combo, catcher Jacob Stallings said Brault mixed in a lot of changeups to Cleveland’s right-hand-heavy lineup. He also threw his curveball a few times to flip counts.</p>
<p>All in all, Brault was a picture of a confident starting pitcher. With how well he’s been throwing this year, that’s with good reason. Now the question is if he can keep that going over more pitches and more innings.</p>
<p><strong>Newman heating up</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Newman had the day off Aug. 6 against the Twins. The shortstop, who hit .308 in 2019, was hitting a measly .167 to that point in 2020.</p>
<p>He pinch hit in the bottom of the ninth inning, though, and bounced a walk-off single up the middle to give the Pirates the win.</p>
<p>That game began what is now an eight-game hitting streak for Newman. In that time, his average has jumped to .275.</p>
<p>“I think he’s having more consistent at-bats, obviously, if I want to state the obvious,” Shelton said before Wednesday’s game. “I think you’re seeing him get into his rhythm. He’s hitting the ball harder. His angles are good. He’s starting to find himself in better counts. I think he’s definitely doing a better job of it.”</p>
<p>With the Pirates’ offensive woes, these small positives are easy to overlook, and that’s certainly fair. A 4-16 team should be asking what is going wrong. But&nbsp;with his early-season struggles, Newman, who seemed like such a bright spot for the organization after last year, was a surprising question mark on the roster.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Historic start</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">With those positives said, man, are the Pirates playing bad baseball right now.</span></p>
<p>Their 4-16 record is their worst 20-game start since 1952, when they began the season 3-17 and finished 42-112.</p>
<p>As of right now, the Pirates have two fewer wins than any other team in the majors. The St. Louis Cardinals, who have played seven fewer games than the Pirates, are 6-7.</p>
<p>The Pirates are on pace to finish the year 12-48. If it were a 162-game season, that pace would extrapolate to about 32-130.</p>
<p>Even the team’s biggest doubters probably wouldn’t expect a final record that poor, but the Pirates are pressing right now, and in 2020, they’re running out of time to get some good feeling flowing through the clubhouse.</p>
<p>Perhaps Stallings said it best after Wednesday’s game.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot harder, especially when things aren’t going well, to be positive with yourself,” Stallings said. “And we’ve got a lot of young guys, too. Some of them, this is the first time they’ve struggled in the big leagues. That within itself has a lot of challenges that come along with it. If I had the answer, I think we’d probably be playing a little better. We have a lot of good players, so we’re going to get out of it. We just need to get out of it sooner rather than later.”</p>
