<h1>Ireland's mystery, history and charm fill 10 green winter days</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There’s something mysterious about Ireland. Maybe it’s the thick fog that rolls low across the ground even late in the day, or the way the grass is almost impossibly green year-round against mostly gray skies. Or it could be that every pub, restaurant and even cobblestone holds a history we can’t even begin to imagine.</p>
<p>But falling in love with the people, the food and the land is no mystery. Each day of our 10-day midwinter trip offered new glimpses into the country that my ancestors once inhabited.</p>
<p><strong>Galway</strong></p>
<p>Before this trip with my husband, Peter, I had been to Ireland once before, at the very end of a long post-college backpacking trip. I didn’t make it to the west coast, so that was a high priority this time. The train to Galway from Dublin is about 2½ hours of rolling farm country, so the journey alone is almost worth the trip.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;the daytime, shops, cafes and restaurants offer a cozy haven from the cold wind that blows in from the ocean. The Galway Riverside Walk winds around the perimeter of town along the river and offers beautiful views of Galway from different perspectives.</p>
<p>The roads were winding and each corner seemed to hold endless possibilities. Our favorite haunt was Garvey’s Inn and Bar, which was packed at all hours and had live music at night. Performances often started with classic Irish pub songs like “Molly Malone” and then pivoted to current pop songs. The band at Garvey’s was particularly fond of Ed Sheeran.</p>
<p>After a pint or four, the streets of Galway came alive with lights wrapped around trees and strung from building to building. We ate dinner one night at the charming Cooke’s Restaurant, which the waitress informed us was actually two 16th-century houses that had been salvaged and converted.</p>
<p><strong>Cliffs of Moher</strong></p>
<p>If you’re in Galway, seeing the Cliffs of Moher is a must. We opted to take a tour bus with Galway Tour Co. Our guide, Tommy, was friendly and thoughtful. He reminded us that our Irish ancestors likely left the island during a famine with hopes of a better life. Many left family behind and never returned. We honor our ancestors when we return to their homeland, he said.</p>
<p>As we wound through the almost lunar landscape of Burren National Park, we learned about historic castles and thatched-roof huts. We pulled over briefly when Tommy pointed out a twisted tree that had tattered strips of fabric around some of its branches. Fairy trees are considered sacred in Irish folklore and are believed to be the home of ancient fairies, he said. Some believe fairies have wish-granting powers. Others believe that good fortune or health will come to the person whose clothing is tied to the branches. We couldn’t help but notice how many different colored fabrics we saw in the branches.</p>
<p>Despite the throngs of people who travel thousands of miles to stand on the edge of the cliffs, it was surprisingly quiet. People seemed to move as one, following unspoken traffic patterns. They seemed stunned to silence by the views, which can’t be described or captured in a photograph. Standing on the edge and staring off into the dark ocean, we felt like very small puzzle pieces, grateful for the rare glimpse of the bigger picture.</p>
<p><strong>Drinking in Dublin</strong></p>
<p>A few days later, we headed to Dublin, where we connected with Peter’s family and friends. Everyone we met was hospitable and accommodating, and the common thread was a commitment to making sure that we, as tourists, felt like welcomed guests.</p>
<p>The cab driver who picked us up at the train station was one example. An error in booking had us arriving at 3:30 p.m. across town from our hotel reservation and even farther from our Jameson Distillery tour at 4 p.m. We explained the situation and he responded in a fine brogue, “Not to worry.” He zipped us from place to place, slowing only when he saw the Garda (Irish police), giving us a thorough rundown of Dublin’s history the whole time.&nbsp;We were the first of our group to arrive at the distillery tour, thanks to our driver.</p>
<p>The real gem of the tour was the Secret Whiskey Tasting. We got to sample four premium whiskey blends, two of which can only be purchased at the distillery.</p>
<p>The tour at Jameson Distillery was the first of three “drinking experiences,” the other two being the Guinness Storehouse Brewery and the Teeling Distillery. If you’re a beer lover, the Guinness tour is tempting, but be prepared for a long day with lots of crowds and lines. It got bonus points for having a surprising amount of vegan and vegetarian options at the cafe.</p>
<p>Where Jameson is built on history and tradition, Teeling is relatively new. It was founded in 2015, although the founders have been in the whiskey industry for much longer. Their whiskeys feel fresh and bold and the distillery is tucked away behind a neighborhood, which offered a nice stroll away from the crowds. Sign up for a distillery tour, or stop in at the bar for a quick sampling.</p>
<p><strong>Dublin history</strong></p>
<p>Dublin is surely a city to eat, drink and be merry, but it is also for history lovers. St. Patrick’s Cathedral is only a short half-mile walk away from the Teeling Distillery. The cathedral was founded in 1191 and has undergone many renovations since. When we visited, the roof was in urgent need of repair and scaffolding covered most of the exterior. But the interior Gothic architecture and artwork were completely intact. Visitors are asked to pay a small entrance fee to see the stained-glass windows and religious artifacts. This is where Irish Catholics spend St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p>We spent one day walking all over the city and ended up at Trinity College. Unfortunately, the Book of Kells exhibit and one of the world’s most beautiful libraries were closed during our visit. The grounds were still beautiful and offered much to see. With a cup of hot coffee in hand, I did some watercolor painting in the center of campus, enjoying the church bells and sounds of a bustling city just beyond the campus gates.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a free and unique historic experience, Ireland’s mysterious bog bodies are on display at the National Museum of Ireland. The bodies are incredibly well-preserved human remains from the Iron Age that were discovered already mummified naturally. The museum is spread out across a few city blocks, although all the branches are within walking distance of each other.</p>

<p><strong>Howth</strong></p>
<p>Toward the end of our trip, we had a free day and no plans. On a whim, we took a 30-minute train ride north of Dublin to the little fishing village of Howth.</p>
<p>We hiked on walking paths that wound through forests and across an open field to get to Howth Castle. The castle was the home of a private family until 2018, when it was sold with plans to redevelop the land commercially. The owners currently allow the public to explore the grounds and exterior of the castle.</p>
<p>After walking along the pier and listening to the sounds of waves crashing and boats rocking in their slips, we ended the night with a pint at the lovely O’Connells Gastro Pub. We felt like we had suddenly stepped into another world. There was a wood-burning stove that people gathered around, and sparkling string lights illuminated the windows. We chatted a while with our waitress, warmed ourselves by the fire and enjoyed Guinness stout (it really does taste better over there).</p>
<p><strong>Northern Ireland</strong></p>
<p>For our final day trip, our group rented a minivan and settled in for the three-hour ride up to Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giant’s Causeway is a naturally occurring phenomenon of thousands of interlocking columns, the result of an ancient volcanic eruption. According to lore, the columns are the leftovers from a causeway built by a giant to connect Ireland and Scotland. After climbing up and down the rock formations for an hour or so, we headed to The Causeway Hotel for refreshments and so, so many laughs.</p>
<p>We piled into our minivan once again and drove to nearby Dunluce Castle, a ruin that dates back to the 13th century. A watch tower still stands and the ocean views from the castle are really astounding. Eagle-eyed “Game of Thrones” fans will also recognize it as the filming location for the great castle of Pyke.</p>
<p>On our way back to Dublin, we stopped for a quick lunch in Belfast, an industrious city not unlike Pittsburgh. Instead of steel, Belfast had linen. It even earned the nickname Linenopolis.</p>
<p>Upon returning to Dublin that evening, we said our goodbyes to our group and headed to our hotel to pack. We sat in the hotel room, dragging our feet, not ready to leave, when our phones buzzed, signaling a text to our group chat. One friends said what we were all thinking: “Let’s meet up for one last drink.”</p>
<p>Of course, one last drink wasn’t really one at all. But that’s the magic of Ireland. It embraces you with open arms and makes you feel right at home. Remember the old Irish saying? Two (or in our case, eight) people shorten a road.</p>
