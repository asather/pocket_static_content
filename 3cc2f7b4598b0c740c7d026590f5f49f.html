<p>DETROIT — Six men were charged with plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer at her vacation home, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday in federal court.</p>
<p>The men plotted for months, consulting and training with militia members, and undertaking rehearsals in August and September, according to the complaint. Four of the six men planned to meet Wednesday to “make a payment on explosives and exchange tactical gear,” the FBI said in the court filing.</p>
<p>The FBI quoted one of the accused as saying Ms. Whitmer “has no checks and balances at all. She has uncontrolled power right now. All good things must come to an end.”</p>
<p>Authorities scheduled a Thursday afternoon news conference to talk about the case. The government used informants and undercover agents to thwart the alleged plot.</p>
<p>The criminal complaint said the plan involved Ms. Whitmer and her second home in northern Michigan.</p>
<p>Ms. Whitmer has been praised but also deeply criticized for the state’s response to the coronavirus. She put major restrictions on personal movement throughout the state and on the economy, although many of those limits have been lifted. The criminal complaint did not mention those orders.</p>
<p>Through electronic communications, two of the alleged conspirators “agreed to unite others in their cause and take violent action against multiple state governments that they believe are violating the U.S. Constitution,” the FBI said.</p>
<p>The criminal complaint identified the six as Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, Brandon Caserta, all of Michigan, and Barry Croft of Delaware.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox said he needed 200 men to storm the Capitol building in Lansing and take hostages, including the governor, according to the FBI.</p>
<p>He said he wanted to try Ms. Whitmer for “treason” and would execute the plan before the Nov. 3 election, the government said.</p>
<p>Later, however, the group shifted to targeting the governor’s vacation home, the FBI said.</p>
<p>The government said the scheme appeared to have roots in a June gathering in Dublin, Ohio, attended by more than a dozen people from several states, including Mr. Croft and Mr. Fox.</p>
<p>“The group talked about creating a society that followed the U.S. Bill of Rights and where they could be self-sufficient,” the FBI affidavit said. “They discussed different ways of achieving this goal from peaceful endeavors to violent actions. ... Several members talked about murdering ‘tyrants’ or ‘taking’ a sitting governor.”</p>
