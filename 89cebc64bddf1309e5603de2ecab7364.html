<h1>Justin Schultz returns to Penguins practice, could play against Flyers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Justin Schultz on Monday practiced with the Penguins for the first time in more than a month and is on track to return in one of the team’s next two games.</p>
<p>Of course, there is that whole All-Star break thing sandwiched between those games, which will factor into the decision of when Schultz rejoins the lineup.</p>
<p>First, though, how did it feel to be back with your teammates, Justin?</p>
<p>“I felt good. Now it’s just a matter of making sure I’m ready to step back in. It’s the still the point of the year where you don’t need to rush things,” he said. “So I’m just making sure I’m ready. And hopefully it’s sooner rather than later.”</p>
<p>Schultz suffered a lower-body injury in the Dec. 17 win in Calgary. He first stepped back on the ice two weeks ago, joined the Penguins on their week-long road trip out west and had skated in an individual setting most days since.</p>
<p>“The last couple weeks it definitely ramped up. It was definitely a slower than I wanted at the start,” he said. “But once I got on the ice, every day felt better.”</p>
<p>During Monday’s full-team practice, he wore a regular jersey, meaning that he had been cleared for contact. After the relatively brisk practice, the defenseman was asked if there is a chance he plays in Tuesday’s game in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>“I was full-out today. So we’ll see,” he said. “Obviously, I want to play.”</p>
<p>Their next game after Tuesday is 10 days later, at home against the Flyers. So the Penguins could choose to hold out Schultz until after the All-Star break.</p>
<p>Either way, the Penguins will get one of their best blue-liners back soon.</p>
<p>“It will be a huge boost,” coach Mike Sullivan said. “He’s a real good player. He’s played a lot of good minutes for us. He’s been banged-up a fair amount this year. So when we do get him back, it will be a huge boost for our team.”</p>
<p>This was Schultz’s second significant stint away from the team. He was previously on injured reserve from Nov. 27 to Dec. 6 with a lower-body injury. In 27 games this season, the 29-year-old has two goals, six assists and a minus-5 rating.</p>
<p>If he plays Tuesday, Juuso Riikola or Chad Ruhwedel will be a healthy scratch.</p>

<p><strong>Only one Dominik practices</strong></p>
<p>Two Dominiks left Sunday’s 4-3 win over the Boston Bruins due to injury. Only one was well enough to practice with the team in Cranberry on Monday.</p>
<p>Dominik Simon was initially injured in the second period of that win. He toughed it out and played in the third before ultimately being removed from the game.</p>
<p>“I feel way better,” said Simon, who scored in Sunday’s win. “Unfortunately, I had to leave the game. I tried to go back but it wasn’t good. I feel good today.”</p>
<p>Dominik Kahun, who was skating on Evgeni Malkin’s wing, suffered a concussion in the second period Sunday and is in the NHL’s concussion protocol, Sullivan said. So he did not practice and is not expected to play in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>“We’ll move guys around as best we can with what we have. That’s what we’ve done to this point,” Sullivan said, adding, “With Dom Kahun out of the lineup, someone else is going to get an opportunity to step in and make a difference.”</p>
<p><strong>Penguins not looking ahead</strong></p>
<p>Sullivan was asked if it was a good thing the Penguins play the rival Flyers in their final game before the All-Star break, ensuring they don’t overlook it.</p>
<p>“I don’t think anybody’s given much thought to the break, quite honestly,” he said. “We still have one game left that’s an important game for us. We just have to make sure that our focus is on the task at hand and we stay in the moment. [They are] a really good team, and we’re going to have to play at our best.”</p>
<p>The Flyers are currently sixth in the Metropolitan Division at 26-17-6. But they trail the third-place New York Islanders by only three points in the standings.</p>
