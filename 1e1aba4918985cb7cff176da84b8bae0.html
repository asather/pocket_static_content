<p>Allegheny County’s death toll rose by eight and its COVID-19 case count grew by 16, according to the latest figures released Thursday by the county health department.</p>
<p>Of the county’s eight new deaths, six are connected to nursing homes, according to the state’s data.</p>
<p>With the latest figures, there have been 94 deaths from the viral disease reported in Allegheny County. Since its first case was reported on March 14, the county has reported 1,289 total cases — 1,244 confirmed and 45 probable. A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to a statement accompanying the numbers.</p>
<p>Of the county’s deaths, 84 are confirmed and 10 are probable.</p>

<p>Just a day after it posted its largest single-day increase in deaths, the state on Thursday reported 97 new deaths. On Wednesday, the state reported 479 deaths. In another indication of the state’s efforts to report accurate data, however, state Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine cautioned that the spike was due to a “reconciliation” of data from different sources, and represents an accumulation of until-now unreported deaths spanning the last 10 days.</p>
<p>“It is not one day’s reporting,” Dr. Levine said. “It’s several days, if not a week or more, of reporting. The count has gone up because of the reconciliation of our data systems.”</p>
<p>The count would have increased by just 37 without the data reconciliation, health department spokesperson Nate Wardle said in an email statement.</p>
<p>In total, 2,292 Pennsylvanians have died due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Statewide, the number of cases increased by 1,397 for a total of 45,763.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Western Pennsylvania, no other counties reported a death due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>In total, the state reported 77 new deaths connected to nursing and long-term care homes on Thursday.</p>

<p>Allegheny has administered at least 16,672 COVID-19 tests, and county health department Director Dr. Debra Bogen said that the county has the capacity to administer roughly 2,000 tests per day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, the county has had 236 hospitalizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said at a press conference Wednesday that 24 inmates and 3 employees at the county jail have tested positive for COVID-19.
