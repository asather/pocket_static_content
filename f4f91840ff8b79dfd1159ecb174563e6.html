<h1>FDA sending out raft of warning letters to fight deceptive product claims of warding off COVID-19</h1>

<p>Many Americans — desperate for a weapon against the novel coronavirus — are turning to the internet for answers.</p>
<p>But with no known cure or proven treatment, people are discovering a host of false claims and fake products, including some that could be dangerous.</p>
<p>To help alert consumers to the minefield of bogus claims, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group’s education fund analyzed 34 warning letters issued by the Food and Drug Administration in recent weeks to companies selling fraudulent COVID-19 products.</p>
<p>It found approximately 1 in 6 pushing colloidal silver products as an effective preventative, treatment or cure for the virus. Colloidal silver is a suspension of silver particles in a liquid and a common ingredient in many drug and dietary supplement scams, U.S. Pirg said.</p>
<p>“Colloidal silver ingredients are not recognized as safe or effective for treating any disease or condition,” the consumer advocacy group warned.</p>
<p>Roughly half of the FDA warning letters involved companies touting products to enhance the body’s immune system to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. Five letters involved unproven claims about cannabidiol (CBD) products. CBD is a non-intoxicating component of marijuana.</p>
<p>Products claiming to cure or treat COVID-19 “defraud consumers of money and can place consumers at risk for serious harm,” the FDA warned last month. “Using these products may lead to delays in getting proper diagnosis and treatment.”</p>
<p>“There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the FDA to prevent or treat COVID-19,” the agency said.</p>
<p>While it’s easy to ignore musing about injecting disinfectants to kill the virus — President Donald Trump wondered about the prospect at a White House press briefing last week — some fake claims being touted may be more tempting.</p>
<p>Consumers often can spot deceptive claims by watching for common red flags, such as spelling errors and rhetorical questions in advertisements. (“What if you had a magic key to help keep your immune system strong and less likely to succumb to illness?”)</p>
<p>The use of testimonials to try to win over customers also can be a tip-off, U.S. Pirg said.</p>
<p>“Testimonies are difficult to prove because they’re based on the experience of one individual — not verified scientific evidence,” the group said. Testimonials also could be completely made up.</p>
<p>For consumers curious about a product, U.S. Pirg recommends contacting a health professional, checking out the seller with the Better Business Bureau and researching COVID-19 on websites run by reputable health organizations such as the National Institutes of Health, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
