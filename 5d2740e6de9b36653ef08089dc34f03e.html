<h1>Pittsburgh Playhouse has its eye on the election in 2020-21 season</h1>

<p>The future of theater can’t come soon enough for Steven Breese.</p>
<p>When he took the post last summer, the dean of Point Park University’s Conservatory of Performing Arts and artistic director of the Pittsburgh Playhouse stepped into a new Downtown facility and a brewing firestorm of student protests over diversity issues.</p>
<p>After it seemed the goals of the university and Theatre students had coalesced, with the musical “Pippin” opening on March 12, the COVID-19 pandemic brought both theater and in-person education to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>With a new purpose and optimism, Mr. Breese and a committee of students, faculty and staff already were looking ahead to the 2020-21 Playhouse season, which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBY3a1O_CeQ&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">announced at 1 p.m. Tuesday as an online event</a>.</p>
<p>No one knows if, or in what form, school or theaters will be back in the fall, but if both get the green light, the Playhouse is ready to fill its three theaters.</p>
<p>One of the decisions: to open with that exciting multimedia production, “Pippin.”</p>
<p>“It was so well-received and such an interesting production that had only a very short time,” Mr. Breese said. “Those student actors, designers, everyone wanted to show it to a wider audience.”</p>
<p>The decision to mount Point Park’s first production of “Angels in America Part One: Millennium Approaches” — the Pulitzer- and Tony-winning drama about politics, faith and the AIDS crisis in the 1980s —&nbsp;seems prescient today.</p>
<p>Along with the Theatre and Dance Conservatory seasons and Speakers Series, the Playhouse season includes two “special events,” adding to Downtown holiday programming with “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens, adapted by Murray Ross in a one-man show (Dec. 19-24) and the return of “Potted Potter – The Unauthorized Harry Experience – A Parody by Dan and Jeff” (Jan. 22-24, 2021).</p>
<p>Lost from the closing of the current season is the world premiere of the “Pump Up the Volume” musical, which will return to Point Park at some point, Mr. Breese said.</p>
<p>Notable in the Media Innovators Speaker series are pundit Donna Brazile and former U.S. Senator Al Franken.&nbsp;From the beginning, the choices for the theater season revolved around the 2020 presidential election and how that weighed on people’s minds.</p>
<p>“We felt we had to do something about immigration in our season, because it has been such a hot topic in the Trump presidency. As we discussed diversity, I found ‘Angels’ had never been done at the Playhouse … and it offers so many teaching and learning opportunities, so that was a decision made early on.”</p>
<p>Despite the excitement over a new season, there is a catch, of course.&nbsp;No one knows where we will be in the COVID-19 pandemic come September.</p>
<p>“We can’t concede anything at this point,” Mr. Breese said. “Let’s say there is a resurgence. There might be some hybrid form of education, partly in class, that might preclude onstage producing early in the fall. But we will look at other, perhaps online opportunities. If theater events are loosening some restrictions, we would explore that opportunity as well.”</p>
<p>Because the Playhouse is part of the university, its budget is not dependent on ticket sales. But Mr. Breese and others have prepared more than one budget to address the possibilities for the future.</p>
<p>“I think if all theaters are to survive this, we have to plan on convening as best we can,” he said.</p>
