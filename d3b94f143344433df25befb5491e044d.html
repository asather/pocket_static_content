<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: Who will earn starting spots on the Steelers' offensive line?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> What do you think the Steelers starting offensive line will be when it all shakes out this year?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> That is a great question. The obvious three are Maurkice Pouncey at center, David DeCastro at right guard and Alejandro Villanueva at left tackle. I think&nbsp;Stefen Wisniewski will win the left guard spot over Matt Feiler, and Zach Banner will beat out Chuks Okorafor for the right tackle spot. But we have a long way before the depth chart is settled.</p>
<p><strong>Barry:</strong> What record would be bad enough this season to get Mike Tomlin fired?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> He could go 0-16 and still have his job. He may be on the hot seat after that, but he wouldn’t get fired.</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Do you think the Steelers will draft or sign an undrafted free agent punter to replace Jordan Berry?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> They will definitely sign a punter. I don’t think they will waste a draft pick on a punter, but they will need to bring one in to challenge Berry.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:&nbsp;</strong>Why do you think it is that so many in your profession are saying sports won’t come back until next year at the earliest? For their own job security, they better hope they are wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I think people —&nbsp;not just sportswriters — are trying to predict what is going to happen based on all the things we read and hear. And health officials and government leaders have made it pretty clear we won’t be able to go back to normal life any time soon. It’s hard to imagine large crowds in the near future. I think sports may come back in some form sooner than most things, but as far as sports coming back to normal with full crowds and all that, it will be some time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Joe L:</strong> What are the chances that The Memorial actually happens the first weekend of June?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I would say slim to none. Golf Digest said sources from the PGA Tour have said the first tournament will be the Charles Schwab Challenge on June 11-14. And of course, there will be no fans.</p>
<p><strong>BJO,&nbsp;@Bduq22:</strong>&nbsp;Attitude, salary issues and drug use have been nullified. You can have one of these guys to start the rebuild the NEW Buccos: Roberto Clemente, Dave Parker or Barry Bonds?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Barry Bonds is the best player in Pirates history. He is one of the three or four best players in MLB history. That is why this is a no-brainer; it has to be Bonds.</p>
<p><strong>not a pirate, @RevD98:&nbsp;</strong>Who’s your sleeper QB in the draft?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> The guy that intrigues me the most is Tyler Huntley from Utah. I watched a lot of Pac-12 games and think the guy has a lot of really great tools. He probably won’t be picked before the fifth or sixth round, but he could be a player who emerges in a few years. I like his arm, his athleticism and I will be interested to see how he develops.</p>
<p><strong>Matt B,&nbsp;@talisker66:&nbsp;</strong>Who is the best ‘role’ player in Pittsburgh sports history (1970-present)? Thinking of the Bob Erreys, Tim Foleys, Jon Kolbs...</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Wow, that is a great question. I like Bennie Cunningham, tight end on some of those great Steelers teams of the 1970s. I will give you one from more current teams — Josh Harrison. He was a super utility guy who did everything on those Pirates wild-card teams. I don’t know that he is the best one of all time in Pittsburgh, but he was a very good one.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew B:</strong> If you were a high school basketball coach, would you run the flex offense, dribble-drive or something like the UCLA four-out series?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> The flex? What is this, 1950? And I’d only run dribble-drive if I have at least three guards who could beat someone off the dribble and a bunch of other guys who could shoot 3s. I would run some sort of high-low offense. I’m still a dinosaur in that I like big men who can play in the post and with their back to the basket.&nbsp;</p>
