<p>A large brush fire burned in a Shaler recreational area Tuesday afternoon, according to township police.</p>
<p>Police identified the fire taking place in Fawcett Fields, a recreational area for soccer and fishing off McElheny Road and near Eagle Canyon Nature Trail.</p>
<p>The fire forced traffic to be reduced to a single alternating lane on McElheny Road between&nbsp;Clearview Drive and Wible Run Road.</p>
<p>Police also reported, on Twitter,&nbsp;“a few poles that have cracked and lines are down” near the trail and Little Pine Creek area. The <a href="https://twitter.com/PoliceShaler/status/1262851167488532482" target="_blank">tweet</a> included a photo of cracked power lines.</p>
<p>Downed high tension wires from sheared power and telephone lines have been attributed as the cause of the brush fire and responders are on the scene, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Allegheny_Co/status/1262857280820776960" target="_blank">tweet</a> from Allegheny County.</p>
