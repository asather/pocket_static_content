<h1>CMS issues detailed recommendations for elective procedures during COVID-19 outbreak</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has issued a three-tier recommendation for hospitals to decide whether to postpone or cancel elective procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak —&nbsp;a more detailed guidance which appears to bring Pittsburgh-area health systems’ policies closer to alignment after UPMC initially balked at county and state health officials’ request to halt non-emergency surgeries and procedures earlier this week.</p>
<p>CMS now suggests that less serious first-tier medical procedures — such as a colonoscopy or minor surgery to treat carpal tunnel syndrome — should be postponed.</p>

<p>In a second tier, hospitals should consider postponing procedures such as hip and knee replacement and non-emergency angioplasty. The recommendation advises that outpatient and ambulatory surgical procedures should be postponed “if possible.”</p>
<p>But third-tier surgeries for a patient who presents with heart problems and most cancers should not be postponed, CMS says.</p>
<p>The question of whether elective surgeries should be pushed back to a time when hospitals aren’t battling the spread of the novel coronavirus came up earlier this week.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Health Department Director Debra Bogen and Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine asked health care facilities to stop doing elective procedures for now so they will be prepared for an expected surge in COVID-19 patients. <strong><br></strong></p>
<p>U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams similarly had urged hospitals to conserve their resources and staff during the outbreak.</p>
<p>Most Pittsburgh-area&nbsp;health systems, such as Allegheny Health Network and Heritage Valley Health System, had already moved in that direction, as did major national medical centers such as Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p>
<p>On Thursday, AHN spokesman Dan Laurent said “we are exactly aligned” with the CMS recommendations.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, UPMC declined to agree to a blanket postponement of non-emergent procedures.</p>
<p>“UPMC recommends that ‘elective’ procedures for those that are at higher risk should be delayed only when it is clinically safe to do so,” said spokesman Paul Wood at the time.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Mr. Wood reiterated, “We continue to serve our patients whose procedures our clinicians believe are not medically responsible to delay. Our careful triaging of upcoming elective procedures on a case-by-case basis meets the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services guidance.”</p>
