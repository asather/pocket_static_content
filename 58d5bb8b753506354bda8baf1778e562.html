<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dozens of people from their 50s to their 90s have died in the United States after contracting the novel coronavirus and the death toll continues rising.</p>
<p>At least <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/health/us-coronavirus-updates-tuesday/index.html" target="_blank">112 people have died</a> since the first US case of the coronavirus was reported in January and the virus has spread to all states, the District of Columbia and some territories.</p>
<p>While the majority were treated at hospitals, a woman in Washington died at home.</p>
<p>A couple in Indiana infected with the virus could not be together when one of them died. As they were hospitalized, they used iPads to see each other and a nurse stayed with one of them before dying, according to Dr. Ram Yeleti, chief physician executive with Community Health Network.</p>
<p>It's unclear whether any deaths include foreign-born individuals, and authorities have not disclosed all of their ages.</p>
<p>Here's what we have learned about those who have died because of the coronavirus, according to a CNN tally of data from state heath officials.</p>
<p>Health officials have said that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/06/health/coronavirus-older-people-social-distancing/index.html" target="_blank">older adults were twice as likely</a> to have serious illness from the novel coronavirus and the fatal cases in the US appear to reflect that.</p>
<p>The majority of people who have died were in their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. The youngest were in their early or mid-50s.</p>
<p>The deadliest cluster so far has been linked to a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington. More than 20 people who lived there and someone who visited the facility have died.</p>
<p>People who lived in other long-term care facilities in Washington, Florida and Kansas contracted the virus and died.</p>
<p>Diabetes, emphysema and heart problems were among the pre-existing conditions that some people suffered before they were diagnosed with coronavirus.</p>
<p>Authorities are still trying to determine how many contracted the virus but have said some of those who died recently traveled overseas.</p>
<p>In California, one person went to Thailand and another one was on a cruise to Mexico. Two people in Florida had traveled outside the country.</p>
