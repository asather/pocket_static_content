<h1>App used to tabulate votes in Iowa is said to have been inadequately tested</h1>

<p>DES MOINES —&nbsp;Sean Bagniewski had seen the problems coming.</p>
<p>It wasn’t so much that the new app that the Iowa Democratic Party had planned to use to report its caucus results didn’t work. It was that people were struggling to even log in or download it in the first place. After all, there had never been any app-specific training for his many precinct chairs.</p>
<p>So last Thursday Bagniewski, chairman of the Democratic Party in Polk County, Iowa’s most populous, decided to scrap the app entirely, instructing his precinct chairs to simply call in the caucus results as they had always done.</p>
<p>The only problem was, when the time came during Monday’s caucuses, those precinct chairs could not connect with party leaders via phone. Bagniewski instructed his executive director to take pictures of the results with her smartphone and drive over to the Iowa Democratic Party headquarters to deliver them in person. She was turned away without explanation, he said.</p>
<p>“I don’t even know if they know what they don’t know,” Bagniewski said of the state party shortly before 2 a.m. Tuesday.</p>
<p>It was a surreal opening act for the 2020 campaign that included unexplained “inconsistencies” in results that were not released to the public, heated conference calls with campaigns that were hung up on by the state party, firm denials of any kind of hacking and a presidential primary left in a strange state of almost suspended animation.</p>
<p>“A systemwide disaster,” said Derek Eadon, a former Iowa Democratic Party chairman.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the state party issued a statement late Monday denying that the delays were the result of the new app’s failure.</p>
<p>“We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results,” said Mandy McClure, the spokeswoman. She added that this was “simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion.”</p>
<p>“The underlying data and paper trail is sound,” she continued, “and will simply take time to further report the results.”</p>
<p>But multiple Iowa Democratic county chairs said they had struggled to use the app and were experiencing hold delays of up to an hour when calling into a phone hotline the party has used for decades.</p>
<p>The Floyd County chairman said that he had three precincts unable to report results, trying both the app and the hotline. The caucus secretary for a precinct in Story County said he had been on hold for over an hour to report the results. The Humboldt County chairman said one of its precincts had faced wait times of up to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Several people who were briefed on the app by the state party said the app was not properly tested at a statewide scale, said&nbsp;It was quickly put together in just the past two months, said the people, some of whom asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p>
<p>The app used by the Iowa Democratic Party was built by Shadow Inc., a for-profit technology company that is also used by the Nevada Democratic Party, the next state to hold a caucus, as well as by multiple presidential campaigns. Shadow’s involvement was kept a secret by Democratic officials through the caucuses.</p>
<p>An official from Shadow did not respond to requests for comment, but one of the company’s investors, Acronym, a progressive nonprofit company, released a statement saying that Acronym is a separate entity from Shadow and that it was still waiting to hear from the Iowa Democratic Party “with respect to what happened.”</p>
<p>Matt Blaze, a professor of computer science and law at Georgetown, said that introducing apps in the midst of an election posed many problems. Any type of app or program that relies on using a cellphone network to deliver results is vulnerable to problems both on the app and on the phones being used to run it, he said.</p>
<p>“The consensus of all experts who have been thinking about this is unequivocal,” Mr. Blaze added. “Internet and mobile voting should not be used at this time in civil elections.”</p>
<p>Any technology, he said, should be tested and retested by the broader cybersecurity community before being publicly introduced, to test for anything ranging from a small bug to a major vulnerability.</p>
<p>“I think the most important rule of thumb in introducing technology into voting is be extremely conservative,” he said.</p>
<p>Christopher C. Krebs, the director of the Homeland Security Department’s cybersecurity agency, said late Monday evening that the mobile app had not been vetted or evaluated by the agency.</p>
<p>The secrecy around the app this year came from the Iowa Democratic Party, which asked that even its name be withheld from the public. According to a person familiar with the app, its creators had repeatedly questioned the need to keep it secret, especially from the Iowa precincts where it would be used.</p>
<p>That person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he had agreed not to discuss details of the app, said that there were concerns that the app would malfunction in areas with poor connectivity, or because of high bandwidth use, such as when many people tried to use it at the same time.</p>
<p>“This app has never been used in any real election or tested at a statewide scale and it’s only been contemplated for use for two months now,” said David Jefferson, a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who also serves on the board of Verified Voting, a nonpartisan election integrity organization.</p>
<p>J. Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan said, “This is an urgent reminder of why online voting is not ready for prime time.”</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferson warned that Nevada was also set to use a similar mobile app to report its caucus results in a few weeks.</p>
<p>In 2016, Iowa state officials used a Microsoft app to report results. A Microsoft spokesman said the company’s involvement in 2016 was a one-off and that it had not participated in the caucus this year.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, reports that Iowa precinct chairs were struggling to use the app fueled conspiracy theories on social media and raised questions about how smoothly the high-stakes nominating contest would unfold.</p>
<p>Hours before the beginning of the caucuses, the headquarters of the state party received multiple calls from precinct chairs from around the state to report problems with the app.</p>
<p>The state party said at the time that nearly all of the calls were related to user-error problems, such as precincts in areas with bad cellphone service that were having difficulty downloading or logging into the app, or others simply asking about the app’s functionality. The party said then that the problems would ultimately not affect the reporting of results.</p>
<p>But Jerry Depew, the Democratic county chairman from Pocahontas County, said that the report line and the help line were the same phone number.</p>
<p>“I had not expected it to be busy at 8 p.m.,” he said, when he tried to call in results from his precinct. “But if caucus chairs were calling for help at the same time that easy caucuses were trying to report results, the phones could have been overloaded.”</p>
