<h1>ACC coaches vote for all-inclusive NCAA tournament field in 2021</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The brackets filled out across offices and groups of friends every March may look quite a bit different for this college basketball season if ACC coaches have their way.</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic — which canceled last season’s NCAA tournament — continues, the heads of the league’s 15 men’s basketball programs voted Wednesday to propose an all-inclusive NCAA tournament that will feature every one of about 350 Division I schools that are eligible to participate in it.</p>
<p>The idea was pushed most prominently by Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, according to Stadium, which first broke the news of the ACC’s proposal. Pitt coach Jeff Capel, who worked under and played for Krzyzewski, backs the proposal.</p>
<p>“We believe strongly that this is in the best interests of the game, but more importantly, the best interests of every Division I student-athlete who has persevered during this unprecedented time,” Capel wrote in a statement.&nbsp;“An NCAA tournament with full participation will be a tremendous opportunity for all players and coaches, as well as a terrific celebration of the game for our fans.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;Louisville coach Chris Mack and Wake Forest coach Steve Forbes both released statements within minutes of the news surfacing to voice their support for the plan. A number of other ACC coaches, including Notre Dame’s Mike Brey and N.C. State’s Kevin Keatts, followed suit later in the afternoon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The NCAA is expected to announce an official start date for the season following a Sept. 16 meeting. CBS Sports previously reported that the oversight committees for men’s and women’s basketball have agreed to propose Nov. 25 as a day to begin holding games.</p>
<p>NCAA president Mark Emmert has shown a willingness to engage with the thought of a non-traditional season, though the NCAA has previously stated its goal is to have a 68-team tournament that begins at its customary time in March.</p>
<p>“Starting with 64 teams is tough,” Emmert said in an interview last month with NCAA.com. “Thirty-two, OK, maybe that’s a manageable number. Sixteen, certainly manageable. But you’ve got to figure out those logistics. There’s doubtlessly ways to make that work.”</p>
<p>Beyond what ACC coaches believe an NCAA tournament field more than five times its typical size would achieve are a bevy of questions, some harder to answer than others (beginning with how receptive the NCAA and leadership in other conferences would even be to the proposal). Where would games be held and how many different sites would there be? How would the season preceding this tournament be structured? How many games would it include? How would seeding be determined? What makes coaches confident that, if teams are bouncing around from venue to venue for each round, player safety can be adequately maintained? Will schools be testing their athletes at the same frequency? What happens to a team in the tournament if a positive test arises? And what becomes of the teams they had previously played?</p>
<p>Should those questions get settled, and provided all of the necessary parties across college basketball give that plan the green light, March might have just a little bit more madness than usual.</p>
