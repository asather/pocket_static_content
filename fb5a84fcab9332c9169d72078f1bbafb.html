<h1>Airlines eliminating flights at Pittsburgh International as demand drops</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the wake of widespread travel restrictions, it’s no surprise that airlines are cutting flights at airports worldwide, and Pittsburgh International Airport is no exception.</p>
<p>According to the airport’s <a href="https://blueskypit.com/" target="_blank">Blue Sky</a> news site, American, United, Allegiant Air, Spirit and JetBlue have all announced reductions due to the Covid-19 crisis. Pittsburgh’s largest carrier — Southwest Airlines — has not dropped flights yet, but has said it is “seriously considering” such action.</p>
<p>More schedule cuts are likely worldwide in the coming weeks as people are being urged to stop non-essential travel and as more borders close and more cities issue orders for residents to hunker down in their homes.</p>
<p>For now, American said it will end flights from Pittsburgh to Phoenix on June 4, and reduce frequencies to Chicago and Philadelphia. Also in June, the airline will reduce daily flights from Pittsburgh to New York Kennedy from four to one.</p>
<p>At United, the plan is to scale back capacity in Pittsburgh by 13% in April, affecting daily frequencies to Chicago O’Hare, Newark International, Washington Dulles and San Francisco International, according to Blue Sky.</p>
<p>Spirit will reduce capacity in Pittsburgh by 7%, with two fewer weekly flights to Ft. Lauderdale and Orlando. The soon to be twice-daily route to Los Angeles International will drop to one daily on several days.</p>
<p>JetBlue will cut some flights to Boston in April, while ultra low-cost Allegiant Air will cut two flights to Punta Gorda, Fla., in May.</p>
<p>Canada’s largest airline — Air Canada — is cutting two of its weekly Montreal flights in April. It also will reduce Toronto service from three times a day to twice daily.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh International has been anticipating reduced service since the early days of the outbreak, airport officials said.</p>
<p>“We know more schedule reductions will be coming as we are expecting demand levels lower than the post-Sept. 11, 2001 period,” said Bryan Dietz, vice president of Air Service Development for the Allegheny County Airport Authority.</p>
<p>The airport has implemented <a href="https://flypittsburgh.com/pittsburgh-international-airport/terminal-information/safety-security/covid19/" target="_blank">new cleaning protocols</a> to help combat the spread of the virus, including the installation of hand sanitizing stations and more frequent cleaning, officials said.</p>
<p>A report released Tuesday by S&amp;P Global Ratings predicted that the coronavirus pandemic will have an "unprecedented" impact on worldwide air travel, reducing passengers by some 20% to 30% from last year. A full recovery isn't expected until 2022 or 2023, the report said.</p>
