<html><head><title>Joe Starkey: Send it in Julius! Not quite Jerome Lane, but legendary Page dunk lives on</title></head><body><p>It was a historic Friday night in Washington, D.C. — Jan. 19, 2001. George W. Bush was set to be innaugarated the next day. Parties and protests raged simultaneously around the Pitt Panthers’ D.C. hotel.</p><p>Julius Page was leaning more toward protest, but not because of his political beliefs. He was furious with Big East officials.</p><p>A high-flying, hot-headed, 6-foot-3 freshman guard from Buffalo, Page felt the refs were disrespecting him — and his upstart team.</p><p>“I had referees tell me, any time I’m going to the basket, ‘You’re not getting that call; you’re a freshman,’ ” Page recalled.</p><p>He decided a change was in order. He dialed up his Uncle John back in Buffalo and told him so. Pitt was playing a 16-0 Georgetown team the next night at the MCI Center. The Hoyas had a couple of aircraft carriers up front, including 7-foot center Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje, aka “Boom-Boom.”</p><p>“I told my uncle, I was like, ‘I’m gonna have to dunk on this dude. (The officials) aren’t going to give me any help,’ ” Page said, looking back 19 years later.</p><p>And yet, on an early drive, Page adjusted his shot instead of going up strong. He was looking for a call. He didn’t get one. So he made a promise to himself: He would try to dunk on his next foray to the hoop even if it meant jumping head-first into the basket.</p><p>Which he darn near did.</p><p>Streaking down the right side, Page snatched a pass from Ricardo Greer at the 3-point line, took a long hop and a power dribble and soared to the rafters before going boom-boom on Boom Boom, flushing a vicious left-handed dunk right in the big man’s mug.</p><p>Surely, you’ve seen it. But just in case, feast your eyes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQhYq2OE5lI.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FQhYq2OE5lI" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><p>This was the definition of posterized, and Pitt, as part of an effort to connect to its basketball past, will be handing out actual posters of the dunk before Saturday’s noon game against Wake Forest. Page will be signing autographs beforehand.</p><p>Bleacher Report ranked Page’s play as the fifth-best college dunk of all-time, just ahead of a <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1181045-25-greatest-dunks-in-ncaa-basketball-history#slide20" target="_blank">Michael Jordan special against Maryland</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That sounds about right to Greer, whom Page laughingly says was expecting a return pass for a layup (he actually was).</p><p>“I probably would have missed it,” Greer said. “That dunk was freakin’ phenomenal. To this day, I think it’s one of the great dunks in the history of college basketball.”</p><p>Alas, it can never be No. 1 on the Pitt list because of “Send it in Jerome!” — Jerome Lane shattering a backboard and Bill Raftery delivering his iconic line.</p><p>Page is OK with that.</p><p>“The guy broke glass,” he said. “They had to stop the game. Come on. You can’t top that.”</p><p>Page’s dunk had more of a profound impact on the program, though. Pitt snapped Georgetown’s winning streak that day and announced itself as a group that would never be pushed around again.</p><p>“(Then-Pitt coach) Ben Howland said that was the play that turned the program around,” Page said. “He still has a picture of it.”</p><p>I figured no one on hand could ever forget it, but if anyone wanted to (other than Boumtje-Boumtje), it would have to be then-Georgetown coach Craig Esherick. I contacted him to see if he remembered.</p><p>His good-natured email reply: “Let me think about this Joe. … Yes, I remember the play!”</p><p>Esherick did not elaborate, other than to say he loves Pittsburgh and that Boumtje-Boumtje is doing well these days as an assistant GM for the Philadelphia 76ers’ G-League team in Delaware (attempts to reach him were unsuccessful).</p><p>Page says he never goes a month without someone mentioning the dunk. He loves rehashing the play but wonders if it overshadows his immense accomplishments at Pitt.</p><p>“It is a gift and a curse, believe it or not,” he said. “That happened my freshman year. I don’t want to say it put me in a box, but I’m just known as that. Not that I have a problem with that. I have no problem with it, but people tend to forget that I also scored over 1,500 points and had to guard the best player on the other team. I started in four straight Big East Championship games and three straight Sweet 16s. Nobody else did that.”</p><p>Page remembered making a call from a pay phone after the game — “That’s how long ago it was,” he said — when then-Washington Wizards star Juwan Howard walked up to him and said, “Good game.”</p><p>Interestingly, Page has never crossed paths with Boumtje-Boumtje in the years since, even though both played in Germany one year. Greer did, though. Him and Boumtje-Boumjte played in a 35-and-over men’s league in Orlando, Fla., about a decade ago.</p><p>“First thing I said to him was, ‘Hey, how you doing?’ ” recalled Greer, now an assistant coach at Dayton. “The second thing I said was, ‘Hey man, that dunk Julius Page caught on you was phenomenal.’ He just laughed. I told him in the game, ‘Watch out: I’m gonna do to you what Julius did to you.’ ”</p><p>A short oral history of the play follows …</p><p>Brandin Knight, teammate, now an assistant at Rutgers: “I think that play was as memorable as Jerome Lane’s dunk. It was a huge upset for us that day, also. It was a pivotal play that gave us momentum and instilled confidence in us that we could beat anyone on any given day.”</p><p>Follow-up: Best dunk you ever saw in person?</p><p>Knight: “1-B. (Former NBA player) Tim Thomas used to have an event called Playaz Ball. College and NBA players could play in this weekend summer showcase. Vince Carter was one of my forwards. On one back-door play I threw Vince a chest pass, and he had already jumped. While in midair, he caught it between his legs and dunked it backwards. It looked like I threw him a bad alley oop pass.”</p><p>Joe Bendel, Pittsburgh sportswriter: “I was under that basket. That’s where they put the media. I’m doing my regular coverage, taking notes back and forth on the game, when I look up and see Page soaring. Boumtje-Boumtje was a big man, and Page just disregarded him — on an NBA stage (the MCI Center). When he dunked, everybody’s jaw dropped like, did that just happen? These were relatively seasoned basketball people. They had seen a lot of things, but never anything like that. It was a transformational moment for that kid and probably spoke to that team’s fearlessness. They were new to the big-time, and they were going to show they didn’t fear anybody.”</p><p>Greer: “I didn’t know what he really did until I saw it the second time around and saw how high he was. His head was on the rim. When I saw it on film, I couldn’t believe how high he was. The interesting part about it was the Georgetown players on their bench after the dunk. They couldn’t believe what Julius just did.”</p><p>Page: “It was kind of like shocking at first, but it created a spark, you know what I’m saying? Ever since that play, we had a swagger and a moment that kind of carried over. It sucked all the wind out of ‘em. After that, things changed. We played them a few games later, at the Field House. That was the first time I’d ever seen the students come down early before the game. They had my face on popsicle sticks, and they were heckling (Boumtje-Boumtje) and stuff. It was hilarious.”</p><p>John Hawkes, Georgetown student (gleaned from his blog several years later): "Clearly we lived in a different era in 2001 — one in which it seemed a capital idea to hold a Big East basketball game in downtown Washington DC on the night of Inauguration. The school bus carrying the first load of students to Chinatown left campus 90 minutes before tipoff. And we crawled. Block by block. Red light by red light. … The story of the game for me came down to one play in the first half. Little Julius Page dunked on Ruben Boumtje Boumtje. Okay, you're saying, a little guy dunked on a big guy — that happens. But to be there at the MCI Center and hear the shocked reaction of the Hoya faithful and feel how Page figuratively punched 12,000 fans in the gut … was to know Georgetown's 16-0 streak was over.”</p><p>Barry Rohrssen, then-Pitt assistant coach, via text: “It was catapulting! Not just in verticality but what it did to help us beat an undefeated Georgetown team that Presidential Inauguration evening, in front of a stunned tuxedo-clad crowd on their way to parties after the game!”</p><p>Follow-up: Best dunk you ever saw in person?</p><p>Rohrssen: “YES!!!”</p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2020/01/04/Send-it-in-Julius-Not-quite-Jerome-Lane-but-legendary-Page-dunk-lives-on/stories/202001030154</original_url>
