<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bill Hillgrove, the longtime radio voice of the Steelers and Pitt athletics, was charged this week with a DUI after police said he drove his car into the front of a grocery store in Murrysville.</p>
<p>Murrysville police arrived at the scene of Ferri’s Shur Shave supermarket located on Old William Penn Highway at 5:18 p.m. Monday after reports of a vehicle crash into the building. Police said they spoke with store owner Gary Silvestri who said Mr. Hillgrove, a regular at his store, pulled into the parking lot and drove his vehicle&nbsp;“directly into the two glass panes,” then walked into the store to fill a prescription, according to a criminal complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After his prescription was filled, the police complaint said, Mr. Hillgrove entered his vehicle and drove away.&nbsp;&nbsp;When police arrived at his home, Mr. Hillgrove confirmed to police he was at the scene and said he had&nbsp;“a couple of beers,” according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That car got away from me,” Mr. Hillgrove told police, according to the affidavit.&nbsp;“I’m telling you the car just got away from me.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police then gave Mr. Hillgrove a preliminary breath test, which tested positive for the presence of alcohol, and a field sobriety test. Police also drew blood for testing, but the complaint said results are pending.</p>
<p>Phone calls seeking comment from Mr. Hillgrove were not returned Friday.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for 1:30 p.m. Aug. 11 at the Westmoreland County Magisterial District Court.&nbsp;</p>
