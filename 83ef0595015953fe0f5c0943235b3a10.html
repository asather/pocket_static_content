<h1>Pennsylvania's clean energy sector sheds 6% of workforce</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This year was supposed to be Scalo Solar Solutions’ best yet.</p>
<p>The Thornburg-based solar developer was putting up one of Western Pennsylvania’s largest solar projects, installing more than 6,000 solar panels on the quarter-mile-long roof and parking lots of Mill 19 as part of the redevelopment of Hazelwood Green.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>But the day after Gov. Tom Wolf announced a statewide shutdown of all but life-sustaining businesses on March 19, the roughly 20 workers in the company’s solar division scrambled to idle and secure the massive site. Then they were laid off until construction is allowed to resume.</p>
<p>Those jobs are expected to return, Scalo Solar’s general manager Michael Carnahan said, but no one knows when and it won’t be all at once.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to go back to normal,” he said. “It’s going to be a new normal.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania lost a larger share of its clean energy workforce in March than every state but Hawaii, according to a <a href="https://e2.org/reports/clean-jobs-covid-economic-crisis-march-2020/" target="_blank">report released Wednesday</a> by the policy group Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2).</p>
<p>The Keystone State lost an estimated 6,070 jobs last month in renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric cars and related sectors as construction and businesses across the economy shut down to help slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The loss amounts to 6.2% of the industry’s labor force in Pennsylvania, which E2 said numbered <a href="https://e2.org/reports/clean-jobs-america-2020/" target="_blank">about 94,000 workers</a> at the end of last year.</p>
<p>About 18,000 of the state’s pre-pandemic clean energy workers were in the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area.</p>
<p>The lost jobs include those selling, making and installing the materials for solar, wind and hydroelectric projects, efficient heating and cooling systems, insulation, lights and appliances.</p>
<p>BW Research Partnership, which analyzed the jobs data for E2, used unemployment claims and the size of the clean energy workforce in each state to estimate the job losses.</p>
<p>Phil Jordan, a principal at the research firm, said the timing and scope of business closures were the largest factors in determining which states recorded the most significant early job losses.</p>
<p>Across the country, the diverse sector shed about 106,000 jobs in March, which represents a 3% drop in the industry’s employment, BW Research found.</p>
<p>Those losses were enough to erase all the jobs the sector gained in 2019, but BW Research expects worse is coming. It anticipates more than 500,000 clean energy jobs will be lost through June — or 15% of the industry’s total workforce.</p>
<p>“Sadly, we think that may end up being a conservative estimate if there is no additional intervention,” Mr. Jordan said.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, “we’ve seen a ripple effect going across the energy efficiency contractors,” said Julian Boggs, policy director with the Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance.</p>
<p>Contractors who focus on residences and small businesses have been hit first and hardest, with some laying off between three-quarters and all of their workers, he said.</p>
<p>Contractors for large commercial projects have been less affected because they have more flexible timelines, don’t necessarily rely on weekly payment streams, and can shift to engineering, design and other offsite work — for now.</p>
<p>“Some of what we worry about is there is just a lagging indicator,” he said, “and that the inability to do onsite work for large commercial projects will catch up to us.”</p>
<p>Clean energy advocates are pushing to be part of future stimulus bills, when Congress and state legislatures turn their attention from rescuing the economy to restarting it.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, nearly 3.4 million Americans worked in clean energy, E2’s annual jobs survey found.</p>
<p>“Clean energy jobs are prevalent in every single state in America — red states, blue states, swing states,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director.</p>
<p>“Hopefully politicians and elected officials, regardless of political stripes, are paying attention to what it takes to get these workers back on the job.”</p>
