<h1>PennDOT looking at creative ways to replace Parkway East bridge near Squirrel Hill Tunnel</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is looking at innovative ways to handle a construction project that could disrupt 100,000 drivers a day: replacement of the Commercial Street Bridge just outside the inbound Squirrel Hill Tunnel.</p>
<p>The 861-foot, concrete arch bridge, opened in 1951, is scheduled for replacement as soon as 2023. PennDOT already has $123 million committed to the project, but District 11 Executive Cheryl Moon-Sirianni said Monday the biggest challenge is designing a project that maintains traffic as much as possible during three to five years of construction.</p>
<p>After working for months with engineering consultant HDR and residents who live under the bridge in Swisshelm Park and Squirrel Hill, PennDOT is deciding between two concepts:</p>
<p>• Erecting temporary supports and building the new bridge next to the north side of the existing bridge; closing the highway for two weeks to demolish the existing bridge; and sliding the new bridge into place. This process would take two to three years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Building in stages around the old bridge. Work will begin on the new inbound lanes and work across the highway. This would take four to five years to complete.</p>
<p>“To take the parkway out of service for an extended period of time isn’t realistic,” Ms. Moon-Sirianni said.&nbsp;“When we advertised for consultants, we asked them to give us some innovative ideas and this is what they came back with.”</p>
<p>Ms. Moon-Sirianni said she is&nbsp;“confident” that area contractors would be able to handle either replacement method. She noted that the Pennsylvania Turnpike used the concept of building a new bridge beside an existing bridge, then sliding the new one into place after demolition in 2017 in Beaver County. And in November PennDOT used hydraulic trailers to carry the new Shaler Street Bridge into place above Route 19/51 near the West End Bridge.</p>
<p>Among the factors PennDOT is considering in choosing which concept to pursue, Ms. Moon-Sirianni said, is the potential traffic jams and damage to local roads when traffic has to be diverted there. Potential air pollution and the cost to motorists stuck in traffic also will be considered.</p>
<p>The project faces a couple of other hurdles: the bridge is historically significant so the design shouldn’t alter the concept too much, and the bridge crosses a valley that includes Commercial Street, which has part of the Swisshelm Park neighborhood, Frick Park and the Nine Mile Run watershed to work around.</p>
<p>And the bridge is massive. It stands 80 to 85 feet above the valley, and with wider shoulders, the new bridge will be 80 feet wide.</p>
<p>Mike Szurley, PennDOT’s project manager, said the department expects to settle on a construction concept in the next couple of months. That will be followed by about 18 months of engineering with the prospect of beginning construction in early 2023.</p>
<p>The existing bridge has three full arches. The replacement concepts under consideration for the slide-in approach would be either steel tied arch with one full arch and two half-arches or a steel plate girder with three support columns. For the staged construction, the options are two concrete arches, two steel arches and girders with three columns.</p>
<p>In neighborhood meetings, Mr. Szurley said residents favor a design that retains arches. The department still is accepting responses to a survey it conducted for the project, which is available at <a href="/Commercial%20Street%20Bridge%20survey" target="_blank">Survey Monkey</a>.</p>
<p>The details of the replacement concepts and potential designs for the new bridge are available on <a href="https://www.penndot.gov/RegionalOffices/district-11/PublicMeetings/Documents/SR376_A62_PublicMeeting.pdf" target="_blank">PennDOT’s website</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
