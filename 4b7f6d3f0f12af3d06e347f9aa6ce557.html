<h1>Science Center seeks $30,000 to update miniature railroad</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Carnegie Science Center is launching a crowdfunding effort to raise $30,000 toward the cost of updating its&nbsp;miniature railroad and village.</p>
<p>Officials at the North Shore museum said the gallery containing the exhibit needs new carpet,&nbsp; fresh paint, signs, LED lighting and motion-activated digital text panels.</p>
<p>The science center also plans to digitize and publish a 100-year-old archive featuring never-before-seen photos and letters from Charles Bowdish, who created the handmade village in his Brookville home in Jefferson County and first displayed it on Christmas Eve in 1919.</p>
<p>The World War I veteran began building Christmas displays in 1917 and offered the first one to amuse guests at his brother’s wedding. Bowdish&nbsp;died at age 92 in May 1988.</p>
<p>In 1954, the exhibit moved to Buhl Science Center. After two years of updates, it reopened in 1992 at Carnegie Science Center.&nbsp;Last year marked the miniature railroad and village’s 100th anniversary.</p>
<p>The online fundraising effort launches Sunday at&nbsp;<a href="http://members.carnegiemuseums.org/site/PageNavigator/CSC%20MRRV%20100th%20Anniversary%20Campaign/MRRV_anniversary_campaign_home.html" target="_blank">bit.ly/MRRV100</a>.&nbsp;Contributors who give $50 receive a vintage track piece from the miniature railroad, an On Track guide with a comprehensive map of the display and article about its latest additions and a miniature railroad postcard.</p>
<p>If you give $1,000, a custom miniature figure painted to look like you or a loved one will be placed in the display for 10 years. In addition, you receive a printed map of the location of the custom figure, a holiday ornament made in the BNY Mellon Fab Lab at the science center, an invitation to the 100th anniversary celebration in November, a pair of 100th anniversary train socks, a vintage track piece from the miniature railroad, an On Track guide and a commemorative postcard.</p>
<p>The center also plans to use its new digital archive to publish a limited-edition centennial book featuring rare photographs, the exhibit’s history, its models and dedicated caretakers.</p>
