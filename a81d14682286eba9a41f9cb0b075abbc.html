<p>Grammy-winning artist Christopher Cross, who set to play Pittsburgh in April before the coronavirus outbreak, announced on social media Friday that he had tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The 68-year-old singer-songwriter, best known for the hits “Sailing” and “Arthur’s Theme,” called the virus “possibly the worst illness I've ever had.”</p>
<p>“I'm not in the habit of discussing medical issues on social media," he wrote on Facebook and Instagram. "But I do so in hope this will help other people to understand how serious and how contagious this illness is.”</p>
<p>Cross was scheduled to perform at the Carnegie of Homestead Music Hall on April 15 as part of this 40th anniversary tour. The concert was moved to May 9 and is now set for Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Cross was part of the tribute to The White Album concert at the Palace Theatre in Greensburg on Nov. 30 with Todd Rundgren, Micky Dolenz and others.</p>
<p>Duran Duran bassist John Taylor took to Facebook Sunday to announce that he was in recovery from the disease.</p>
<p>“Perhaps I am a particularly robust 59 year old — I like to think I am — or was blessed with getting only a mild case of COVID-19, but after a week or so of what I would describe as a ‘Turbo-charged Flu’, I came out of it feeling okay,” Taylor wrote. “Although I must admit I didn’t mind the quarantine as it gave me the chance to really recover.”</p>

<p>Cross and Taylor are the latest musicians to announce a positive test, joining a list that includes John Prine, Jackson Browne and Marianne Faithfull. Jazz musicians Manu Dibango, Bucky Pizzarelli, Ellis Marsalis Jr. and Wallace Roney and Fountains of Wayne singer Adam Schlesinger have all died from the disease.</p>
<p>Browne and former Bob Dylan guitarist Larry Campbell, also suffering from COVID-19, were scheduled to perform in Pittsburgh prior to the pandemic.</p>
