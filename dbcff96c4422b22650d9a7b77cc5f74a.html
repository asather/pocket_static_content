<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Veolia Water Technologies Inc. is planning to sell or close its offices in Moon Township by the end of June.</p>
<p>Veolia notified the state Department of Labor &amp; Industry that it would close its Airside Business Park offices by the end of June if the companyâ€™s industrial products division is unable to sell the facility by March 27. Four people, including construction and contracts managers, will be permanently furloughed by the end of March, followed by 29 more employees by June 26, according to the state.</p>
<p>The bulk of the furloughs will occur in June to allow the completion of projects and to transfer work to other company facilities, Veolia said in a letter to the state. Engineers, facilities manager and instrumentation and controls specialists are among the jobs being eliminated.</p>
