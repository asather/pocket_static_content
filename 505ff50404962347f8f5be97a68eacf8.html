<h1>Howard Finkel, a legendary WWE Hall of Fame ring announcer, dies at 69</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Howard Finkel, the legendary ring announcer and WWE Hall of Famer, has passed away, the company<a href="https://www.wwe.com/article/howard-finkel-passes-away" target="_blank"> announced Thursday. </a>He was 69.</p>
<p>No cause of death was mentioned. Finkel had reportedly been dealing with health issues in recent years.</p>
<p>Finkel, known as "The Fink," made his debut at Madison Square Garden in 1977 when WWE was known as WWWF. He became a full-time announcer two years later, and when WWE was established in 1980, Finkel became the first employee, as noted by WWE chief brand officer <a href="https://twitter.com/StephMcMahon/status/1250793115390226438?s=20" target="_blank">Stephanie McMahon in a tweet.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Howard's voice is iconic &amp; recognized by generations of fans. He will be missed," McMahon tweeted.</p>
<p>Finkel would mark championship victories with his signature call, "and Nnneeeww world champion!" and he was recognized for his dedication to the wrestling industry when he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009.</p>
<p>Finkel, a native of Newark, N.J., even got to get in the ring himself when he fought against manager Harvey Wippleman in 1995 and helped shave Jeff Jarrett's head in a "Hair vs. Hair" match in 1998, according to WWE.</p>
<p>He even is credited with coming up with the name WrestleMania, the sport’s biggest event, from the start — inspired by the Beatles’ American invasion.</p>
<p>“This was 1984,” he told Slam Wrestling in 2014, “so I said 20 years ago four guys from Liverpool came across the shores to the United States and made a phenomenal impression on everybody. They called that Beatlemania. So I said, ‘There was Beatlemania. Why can’t there be WrestleMania?‘”</p>
<p>His appearances became less frequent in recent years but Finkel remained “an indispensable resource” within the organization, the WWE said in its statement.</p>
<p>"When considering the greatest ring announcers in the history of sports and sports=entertainment, you'd be hard-pressed to name one better than Howard Finkel," WWE said on its website.</p>
<p>Numerous wrestlers were posting condolences on Twitter.</p>
<p>"Howard (Finkel) was on Team Hogan through the good and bad times," WWE Hall of Famer <a href="https://twitter.com/HulkHogan/status/1250798842989162497?s=20" target="_blank">Hulk Hogan tweeted.</a> "Even when I was on the outs Howard would call on a consistent basis to tell me to always keep my head up."</p>
<p>"I'll never forget the last few times I saw him," WWE superstar <a href="https://twitter.com/FightOwensFight/status/1250799627743514624?s=20" target="_blank">Kevin Owens tweeted</a>. "The excitement he still had for the industry, the genuine concern he showed when asking about how my family was doing despite his own declining health... I'm so grateful I got to know him."</p>
<p>News of Finkel's death is another blow to what has been a rough week for WWE.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the company <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/15/business/coronavirus-wwe-drake-maverick-curt-hawkins-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">released several of its Superstars</a> in an effort to cut back on spending during the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/world/coronavirus-outbreak-intl-hnk" target="_blank">coronavirus pandemic. </a>Among those let go were Drake Maverick, Curt Hawkins, Sarah Logan and Epico.</p>
