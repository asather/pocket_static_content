<h1>Pirates' Kevin Newman doesn't believe his lackluster 2020 reflects the player he can be</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kevin Newman doesn’t know why he has been inconsistent this season.</p>
<p>After breaking out in 2019, batting .308 with 64 RBIs in more than 500 plate appearances, the Pirates infielder has fallen off in 2020, all the way down to a .229 average entering Saturday’s game against the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>
<p>It hasn’t been a complete loss the entire season, per se. In early and mid-August, he enjoyed a nine-game hitting streak that included a four-hit game against the Detroit Tigers. The entire month of August, in fact, his average was over .300, and he was a mainstay in the top of the Pirates’ lineup.</p>
<p>But that has since fallen by the wayside. When the Pirates released their lineup for Saturday’s game, Newman was slotted in the seventh spot. He has spent a fair amount of time there recently. Lineup positions aren’t always indicative of how a player is hitting, but in this case it does exemplify a bit of a fall from grace for Newman since his stellar rookie campaign a year ago.</p>
<p>“You know, I wish I knew. I probably could have fixed it a little quicker,” Newman said of the reasons for his struggles. “But it’s just one of those things. Hitting’s hard. You go through stints where you’re really, really good and you go through stints where you’re not. That’s just part of the game, no matter what level you’re at.”</p>
<p>The problem with Newman’s hitting falling off this season is it is the part of his game that is most valuable.</p>
<p>Even when he was raking in 2019, he was tied for the third-most fielding errors on the team with 12. That was in over 1,000 innings.</p>
<p>This year, in less than one-third of the innings, he has already accrued seven errors, playing shortstop and second base, the most of any Pirate. While manager Derek Shelton said Saturday that the plan is for Newman to continue to play both middle infield spots, the emergence of third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes and the solid fielding of shortstop Erik Gonzalez have bumped Newman to second base most days now, with former infielder Adam Frazier moving out to left.</p>
<p>Statistically, Newman has been slightly better on the right side of the infield than at shortstop, but the point is that there is plenty of room for improvement.</p>
<p>“I can't pinpoint one thing, honestly. We got our work in as best we could,” Newman said.&nbsp;“There were a lot of limitations, with every thing that’s going on this year, but it's no excuse. I just didn't make as many plays as I would have liked. So, just another thing going in the offseason, to really key in on, really work hard and come back better at.”</p>
<p>While it is hard for Newman to come up with direct explanations for his worse statistical season, he does believe 2020 has made it harder to make adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He points out that he did have around 500 at-bats last season, obviously followed by far fewer through 51 games this year. That works against Newman in two ways, allowing less time for his numbers to average out naturally and for mid-season adjustments.</p>
<p>That doesn’t even take into account the mid-season abdominal injury that Newman suffered in late August. He says he didn’t feel it affected his play at all, citing his ability to bounce back quickly from soft muscle tissue injuries.</p>
<p>Basically, Newman simply believes his struggles this year have been a bigger deal than they would have been in 162 games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hope for the Pirates is that is true. In an ideal world, the 27-year-old is still a part of their future. For that to come to fruition, Newman will still have to take some lessons from 2020, tweak some things in the offseason and come back for 2021 like the 2019 version of himself.</p>
<p>“I’m super competitive. I am probably a little harder on myself than I should be, so I definitely don’t see this as the player that I am,” Newman said. “But I want to be better, and I’m going to use this season as fuel to come back in the offseason, work as hard as I can and come back and be the player that I know I can be. I know that this year wasn’t a reflection of who I am as a major-league baseball player.”</p>
