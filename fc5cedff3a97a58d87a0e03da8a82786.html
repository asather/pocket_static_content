<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gabriella Salvucci, a 15-year-old singer-songwriter from Oakdale, and Creative.Life.Support have organized Black Lives Matter Here, a streaming benefit concert from 7 to 10 p.m. Friday to support <a href="http://1hood.org/" target="_blank">1Hood Media</a>.</p>
<p>She will be joined by a mix of rappers and singer-songwriters, including Rusted Root’s Liz Berlin, Phat Man Dee, Brittney Chantele, Treble NLS, JM The Poet, Quinn Volpe, Annie Duda, Ariel Batson, Lexi Mulroy, Ethan from Self Seriousness, Kind of Blue Jazz Band, Leeland Rosenfeld and Oliver Blackstock IV, and speaker Miracle Jones.</p>
<p><a href="http://gabriellasalvucci.com" target="_blank">Salvucci</a>, who has been training at the Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School and the Afro American Music Institute, plays piano and ukulele and sings. In May, she released a debut single, <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=DMdbiccxLC4&amp;feature=share" target="_blank">“Hoax,”</a>&nbsp;that reveals influences like Fiona Apple, Maggie Rogers and Florence + the Machine, along with a maturity beyond her years.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, she has performed at Mr. Small's Theatre, Steamworks Creative, The Saturday Light Brigade Radio Show and Millvale Days, along with busking in Bakery Square and doing open mikes at Black Forge Coffee House and the Thunderbird Music Hall. She was also part of last month’s Pittsburgh Women's Music Festival concert.</p>
<p>The performers released a joint statement, saying, “As artists we believe in our souls that we must use our voices to uplift and support one another, and we must work together to end racism and dismantle white supremacy in our lifetimes. We look forward to singing and sharing our music with you.”</p>
<p>The concert is co-presented with Creative.Life.Support, the educational program at Mr. Smalls.</p>
<p>1Hood Media, which has organized some of the recent protests, is a collective of socially conscious artists and activists led by rapper Jasiri X.</p>
<p>The concert will be live streamed at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CreativeLifeSupport-120326218038034/" target="_blank">Facebook.com/creativelifesupport</a>.</p>
