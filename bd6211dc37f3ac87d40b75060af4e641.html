<h1>Police charge Fox Chapel man in second homicide</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police have charged a Fox Chapel man with killing a man who went missing in December and whose remains were found near the alleged killer’s property in March.</p>
<p>Adam Rosenberg, who was already in the Allegheny County Jail in a separate homicide case, will be served Tuesday with an arrest warrant in the death of Christian Moore-Rouse, 22, of Verona.</p>
<p>He is charged with homicide, robbery, abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and firearms violations.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg, 21, had previously been charged Feb. 19 with killing Jeremy Dentel, 28, inside Mr. Dentel’s home in Baldwin Borough several days earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore-Rouse was reported missing on Dec. 25. He was last seen alive four days earlier.</p>
<p>“Over&nbsp;the course of several months, investigative leads were developed in both the homicide and missing person investigations implicating Adam Rosenberg in the disappearance of Christian Moore-Rouse,” Allegheny County police said Tuesday in a statement.</p>
<p>On March 3, county detectives found human remains in a wooded area in the 900 block of Settlers Ridge Road in Fox Chapel near the Rosenberg family property. Police said Tuesday there was evidence of a shooting at the scene, and the remains were identified as those of Mr. Moore-Rouse.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of gathering information to have a better&nbsp;understanding of the allegations. Once all of the facts are known to&nbsp;the defense team, we will proceed accordingly,” said Casey White, one&nbsp;of the lawyers on Mr. Rosenberg’s defense team.</p>
<p>Randall McKinney, the lawyer for Mr. Moore-Rouse’s family, declined comment.</p>
