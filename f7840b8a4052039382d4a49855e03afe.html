<h1>Pitt safety Damar Hamlin granted extra year of eligibility, will return for 2020 season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Damar Hamlin spoke softly, and maybe a little somberly, on Nov. 26.</p>
<p>In the run-up to Pitt's senior day game against Boston College, several departing upperclassmen were ushered in and out of the Panthers' team room for interviews with local media. Hamlin was the last to answer questions, apologizing for the lengthy delay and citing a long session in the trainer's room.</p>
<p>But it could also be true that maybe Hamlin didn't want to reflect on his Pitt career just yet. Maybe he didn't want to acknowledge that it was over.</p>
<p>Thankfully for the senior and his teammates, it's not.</p>
<p>Hamlin will be back for the 2020 season. The safety's waiver request for a fifth year of eligibility was granted by the NCAA, allowing him to return to the Panthers' secondary alongside friend and fellow playmaker Paris Ford.</p>
<p>Hamlin announced the news through a video on Pitt football's official Twitter account on Wednesday afternoon. In the video, Ford — a rising redshirt junior with NFL potential — said, "I'm glad I'm coming back." Then, Hamlin entered the frame and added, "And I'm coming back, too."</p>
<p>The McKees Rocks native and former Central Catholic standout smiled wide in the video as he put his arm around Ford, overlooking the city on Mount Washington. The city he grew up in, and the city he'll play in for one more year.</p>
<p>"This city means everything to me," Hamlin said in a video posted to his Twitter account. "Playing in my own backyard with my family in the stands makes every game that much more personal. Being from here, giving inspiration to the young ones looking up to me, I love every moment of playing for Pittsburgh."</p>
<p>Hamlin's situation was, for a lack of a better word, a weird one.</p>
<p>The former four-star cornerback played in three games as a freshman, but was otherwise limited due to injury. That 2016 campaign counted as a year of eligibility burned, as it predated college football's current rule of allowing four games played with a redshirt.</p>
<p>There's no precedent for players being retroactively granted an extra year of eligibility based on games played alone. But due to the injury aspect of Hamlin's situation, he was awarded an extra year with the Panthers. Which is a coup for both Hamlin and head coach Pat Narduzzi.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled that Damar was able to receive a fifth year," head coach Pat Narduzzi said in a statement. "We weren't certain after our bowl game what the future would hold. We really appreciate the efforts of our compliance staff as Damar went through this process. I know Damar is ready to take full advantage — academically, athletically and personally — of his final year at the University of Pittsburgh."</p>
<p>For Hamlin, he gets another season with Ford and those he joined the program with four years ago. The hard-hitting safety said on Nov. 26 that he wished he had redshirted as a true freshman instead of playing in those three games and called it "weird" that he'd walk on senior day against Boston College.</p>
<p>"I sit in the front row of meetings, and all the people who I really came in with and thought I'd be graduating with sit behind me," Hamlin said at the time. "They're still about to have more time. It's just a weird feeling knowing I'll be the first one out of here."</p>
<p>Of course, he won't be. Hamlin will link up again with a crop of returning starters from Pitt's staunch 2019 defense.</p>
<p>Prior to Pitt's Quick Lane Bowl appearance, there were murmurs of a possible fifth year for Hamlin, but it was thought to be somewhat of a long shot. Ford, second-team All-American defensive tackle Jaylen Twyman and second-team All-ACC defensive end Patrick Jones II also had NFL decisions to make. The unit that powered Pitt to eight wins could have been devastated by departures.</p>
<p>But those three bypassed the 2020 NFL draft, and now Hamlin brings experience (30 career starts) and stable production (84 tackles, 10 pass breakups) back to Pitt next season.</p>
<p>The Panthers will need to replace three starters: cornerback Dane Jackson and linebackers Kylan Johnson and Saleem Brightwell. But at the same time, defensive end Rashad Weaver and defensive tackle Keyshon Camp, both lost in August to season-ending injuries, ought to be back and champing at the bit.</p>
<p>Pitt, which finished the 2019 season ranked 15th in total defense, should intimidate offenses yet again in 2020. Hamlin's fifth year only accentuates that.</p>
