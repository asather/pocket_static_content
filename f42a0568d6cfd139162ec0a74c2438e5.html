<h1>Murrysville residents host candlelight vigil for Justice Ginsburg to spark unity, peace</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Megan Pacic has never known a world before Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Ms. Pacic, 23, said she had the honor to see Justice Ginsburg in action while sitting in on a court proceeding at the Supreme Court Building with her mother and brother while visiting Washington, D.C., in 2018.</p>
<p>“It was a particularly mundane day,” Ms. Pacic said.&nbsp;“Most Supreme Court decisions are unanimous, so we watched [Justice Elena] Kagan deliver a boring opinion.”</p>
<p>Ms. Pacic said that even though Justice Kagan was speaking, she could not take her eyes off of Justice Ginsburg — she was that star-struck.</p>
<p>“Justice Ginsburg sat in a chair that could probably fit three of her,” Ms. Pacic said, then laughed.&nbsp;“I couldn’t figure out why she seemed to be the most imposing person up there. And then I realized, it was because most of the names I heard admitted to the bar were women.”</p>
<p>Ms. Pacic, who&nbsp;works as a paralegal at Family Design Resources, said that throughout her life, Justice Ginsburg has always been an inspiration.</p>
<p>Justice Ginsburg, a pioneering advocate for women’s rights who became a cultural icon through her powerful dissenting liberal opinions, died Friday at age 87 after battling cancer for over a decade, sparking mourning across the nation.</p>
<p>Ms. Pacic, along with 40 other community members in Murrysville, gathered at 6 p.m. Sunday in front of the Murrysville Senior Citizen Center for a candlelight vigil in honor of the late jurist.</p>
<p>As the sun set on the center’s parking lot, the group lit candles and took a moment of silence.</p>
<p>Organizer Michelle McFall, 51, of Murrysville, told the crowd that the vigil was not a political event, but rather a rally for unity, peace and justice. Two people held signs that read “peace and justice.”</p>
<p>Prior to the candle lighting, speakers discussed Justice Ginsburg’s ability to unify groups, citing her famous friendship with the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who historically leaned conservative in his rulings.</p>
<p>A few prayers were shared throughout the vigil. Linda Jones, a resident of Monroeville, also read a Hebrew passage on social justice in recognition of Justice Ginsburg becoming the first Jewish female justice on the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“She pursued justice, she pursued liberty for all. That was her passion, and that should be our passion,” Ms. Jones said.&nbsp;“We are mourning her, we are sad, but we need to go on and we need to continue liberty and justice for all of us, no matter who you are.”</p>
<p>Keethu Shriram, a Franklin Regional High School senior,&nbsp;sang the “Star-Spangled Banner” in front of the group.</p>
<p>“2020 has been so dividing with everybody, so I really look up to how elegant she was with what she stood for, especially women,” said Keethu, 17, of Murrysville.</p>
<p>When she first heard the news of Justice Ginsburg’s passing, Keethu said, the feeling of fear hit her the hardest, then grief.</p>
<p>“Just to see how what’s going to happen after she’s passed and how her legacy is going to be continued,” Keethu said.&nbsp;“And then I felt really sad that maybe I’m so grateful for her for what she’s done for the country. But a lot of grief that she’s gone.”</p>
<p>Seeing the crowd of people at the vigil made her feel as through she wasn’t alone in her grieving process.</p>
<p>“I’m so grateful that we can all come here in unity to celebrate her memory,” Keethu said.</p>
<p>Ms. McFall said she organized the event to spark unity in what she describes as a&nbsp;“moment of divisiveness.”</p>
<p>“We lost a woman that despite the fact of being identified as a liberal icon, she was more than that. She was a uniter, a justice warrior, larger than life. She personifies the possibility of America in any imaginable way and is what inspired me,” Ms. McFall said.</p>
<p>Growing up in poverty, Ms. McFall said, she looked up to Justice Ginsburg’s resilience to keep going when times were tough.</p>
<p>“She was my person,” Ms. McFall said.&nbsp;“And as I grew up and got older, the respect for her deepened.”</p>
<p>She said that while looking at the crowd of people at the vigil, she noticed people from multiple generations show up. But seeing the younger generation speak at the vigil especially brought tears to her eyes.</p>
<p>“I haven’t cried since hearing about RBG’s death until hearing Keethu sing,” Ms. McFall said.&nbsp;“That’s when the emotional break for me happened. When I heard younger people represent the promise of what we can be. Because they’re still optimistic, and they’re going to fight their way to make sure we’re OK.”&nbsp;</p>
