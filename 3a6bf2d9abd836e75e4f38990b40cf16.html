<h1>Two more members of violent DS44 gang plead to drug charges, another set for tomorrow</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One by one, the DS44 gang is coming undone.</p>
<p>Two more conspirators pleaded guilty to federal charges this week and another is set to plead tomorrow, bringing the total pleas to 14 among the 37 under indictment since a federal takedown last year.</p>
<p>One defendant has been sentenced, although he was a minor player and avoided prison.</p>
<p>The Darccide/Smash 44 gang had been the focus of a federal wiretap investigation targeting its drug-dealing and related violence in Pittsburgh's southern neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The lead defendant is Christopher Highsmith, a felon from Irwin, according to the U.S. attorney's office. His case is pending.</p>
<p>DS44 originated in the St. Clair Village housing complex, which has since been torn down, and feuded violently with another Beltzhoover gang known as Zhoove, led by Lance Gardenhire of Zara Street. His ring, supplied from New Jersey, was largely dismantled by federal authorities in 2015; he was sentenced in 2017 to 20 years in prison for dealing between 30 and 90 kilos of heroin.</p>
<p>The DS44 gang is similarly accused of distributing heroin and fentanyl on a large scale along with cocaine and cocaine base, and some members are also charged with weapons offenses.</p>
<p>The first to plead was Amber Rogers, who in December admitted to retrieving drugs from various stash houses and distributing them to customers.</p>
<p>This week, James Givner, 26, formerly of Pittsburgh, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute. Wiretaps indicated he sold heroin, fentanyl and cocaine to customers and facilitated drug deals for Highsmith. During a traffic stop on Jan. 14, 2019, county police caught Givner with more than 180 stamp bags of heroin and a baggie of cocaine base. Givner accepted responsibility for distributing 220 grams of heroin and fentanyl and six grams of cocaine base. He also admitted to possession of a gun in connection with his drug-dealing.</p>
<p>Rico Taylor, 35, also formerly of Pittsburgh, also pleaded guilty this week. Prosecutors said he distributed heroin and fentanyl and served as a supplier for Highsmith.</p>
<p>On Friday, St. John Williams, 27, of Pittsburgh, is set to enter a plea.</p>
<p>The only defendant to be sentenced so far is Michael Broglie, 51, of Hundred, W.Va., who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute heroin and fentanyl after wiretaps revealed him discussing deals with another member of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Stickman earlier this month gave him time served and probation.</p>
