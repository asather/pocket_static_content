<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 06.24.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, we're gonna start our chat in about 15-20 minutes so get your questions ready.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, let's get our chat started....go!!</p>
<p><strong>Bigedbarr71</strong>: If the NFL would start the season, but have to abandon it after a few games because of the virus, would you expect players’ stats to count? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, unless the season was merely postponed for a later re-start. Otherwise, if season is canceled, I imagine the stats would be also.</p>
<p><strong>Doug from Raleigh</strong>: Are Steelers players being tested regularly now, or will there be some unpleasant surprises when "training camp" opens? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, the players aren't around to be tested. They're not allowed at the facility so no group testing is being done. Now, some might have done it on their own, but the team is not conducting any tests.</p>
<p><strong>lamberto</strong>: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after eading tomlins staement about mccullers getting a crack at nose tackle I cant help but wonder - why????</span> <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: History speaks for itself. He can get all the cracks he wants, it won't change anything. Have I ever mentioned he has 41 tackles in six seasons??? But, to your point, the bigger question is -- why would he even be given a crack. What, six years of evidence isn't enough??</p>
<p><strong>lamberto</strong>: he's done nothing in the time he's been here, I don't think he has 10 tackles total over his time here <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: As I just said -- 41. That averages to just under 7 a season.</p>
<p><strong>Eric L</strong>: Hi Gerry, thanks for your time and thoughts! Who will be 2-4 among these receivers in yards? Johnson, Washington and Claypool? Does Johnson have a chance for more yards than JuJu? If JuJu has 1k or more yards would the Steelers tag him for 2021? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, with the addition of Claypool and Eric Ebron, I think the numbers will be even more spread around this season. I still think JuJu will be the main target with Ben back and will have more yards than any of the others, barring injuries. And I don't think the Steelers will tag him, I think they will extend his contract.</p>
<p><strong>Bigedbarr71</strong>: Gerry, do you think before games they should just have the national Anthem while the players are in the locker room to avoid any negative feelings in general? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I thought they should have done that after the 2017 season, like they used to do. But, if they do it now, it will look as though the league is trying to sweep the problem under the carpet. So I wouldn't anticipate that happening.</p>
<p><strong>Bigedbarr71</strong>: Do we know who was tested positive for Covid19 in the spring? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. I was told it was two periphery players, not any of the regulars</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Tomlin says Feiler will get the 'first snap' at LG. Ramon Foster stated that Feiler could possibly be resistant to a permanent move to LG, because he's established at RT and guards get paid less. His agent could get involved. I guess that is a behind-the-scenes reality? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: True, but I think the move is just for the short-term. The problem is, none of the new guys -- Stefen Wisniewski, Kevin Dotson, Chris Wormley -- have had a chance to be on the field and work with their new teammates. So, for right now, Tomlin will go with guys who are familiar with what they do. I don't expect that to be the way they begin the regular season.</p>
<p><strong>TPhunter</strong>: Hi Gerry. Should the NFL be forced to delay the season, what is your guess as to the absolute latest that the Super Bowl would be played? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think there is any drop-dead point as to when the Super Bowl has to be played. Of course, if it goes to late February, it will butt up against the combine. Then again, they can always delay the combine I suppose, which, given the state of the virus, could be a very real possibility.</p>
<p><strong>TPhunter</strong>: Gerry, any thoughts about Big Ben's admission to alcohol and porn addictions? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: None</p>
<p><strong>Grip</strong>: Do u think? McFarland. Will shine this year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It's going to be tough for any rookie, with no OTAs, minicamp and maybe no preseason games, to have any kind of impact this season.</p>
<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Asked brian the other day this question and interested in your opinion. Better front office draft day move? Moving up considerably in first round for Troy or trade with Rams for The Bus? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Good question, but I'd have to say the move up to get Troy, though you could certainly make a case for the Bettis trade.</p>
<p><strong>ALB</strong>: If the other major sports start playing next month and one or more leagues find that they just can’t do it because of the virus, would that signal the end of football for the fall? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It could. I think it will be a litmus test for them.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong>: Gerry-really enjoy the chats. The Steelers appear to loaded with high quality receivers between the WR's and TE's. It takes balance however. Do you think the team can run the ball adequately to chew up clock and win games? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think having Ben back and the potential of having so many diverse receiving threats will automatically help the run game. So will having a QB who can get in and out of plays, change and slide the protection, audible, run the no-huddle. All that will make the run game better.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: If you got a free, top 10 player that you could insert anywhere into the lineup, what position would you target? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Gee...let's see now...Which do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Ralph LA</strong>: I was surprised to see several Steelers on the field praying before the game. A season ticket holder told me that he’s seen members of both teams praying on the field after games, sometimes together. Is that typical? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes, happens every game, every week. Some members of both teams get in a circle and pray after the game. I don't know why you would be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong>: Thanks Gerry. With so much up in the air, when do you think you will you have access to the players? Always thought you guys did a good job with the interviews and added insight. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: We're still not sure. We have had access through periodic zoom calls with some players and even Mike Tomlin. But, I can tell you this, the days of the media getting in the locker room during the week and after games are gone for now, and maybe for a long time. The ability to talk to several players, to gain perspective and insight, whether on or off the record, is gone. As a result, you will see more and more players using their social-media platforms to convey their thoughts, feelings and news happenings, though that has already been going on for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph LA</strong>: Praying is only surprising since you don’t see it on TV. Just the pre and postgame summary. It’s obvious if the offensive line as a whole is doing well but from your position are you able to discern how individual lineman are doing? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ralph, I am not qualified to evaluate offensive linemen and how they perform, nor is any media person unless they played the position in the NFL. But what I do is find out from the people who do evaluate them -- the coaches -- how they performed.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: have you heard how they will handle fans? Im not a scientist but this isnt going away anytime soon and whereas i agree things need to open up we will have waves. Having said that i think you need fans. 2 seats between all seats unless with immediate family? seems no one has a clue <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: If they do have a clue, nobody has said how they will handle the possibility of fans attending games. I'm certain the league and their teams have all discussed ways to allow this to happen, but I don't think anyone is going to say how until it has been determined whether fans can or cannot attend games. I agree, the games will not be the same without fans. And I think your point about having two seats open between fans sounds good, but I don't know how that will be applicable. That would mean only 1/3 of all tickets would allowed to be used, or roughly 22,000 people per game. I think a lot of people who come to games -- if they can come -- will seek out spots in the end-zone walkways to watch games.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong>: That's a real shame. So much objectivity is lost if the news is coming from the player's social media platforms. You guys become somewhat hamstrung with the limited access. The teams should consider new access rules that keep some of what we had in the past, maybe just increased access and time allotment via media platforms that keep the social distancing. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: We will still have some access to players, but likely in a controlled interview-room session, and probably just 2-3 players at most. We will not have access to the locker room again for a long time, I'm afraid. And, yes, that will drastically impact the way we do our jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Lou</strong>: Hi Gerry. With so many states still surging with Covid, how do you see this season playing out? My guess is that they try to get this season going, but the whole thing is shut down before game 1. Stay well! Stay safe! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think there's any question the objective and intention of the NFL is to start the season on Sept. 10. Now, what happens between now and then, who knows? I don't think they will start if they think there's any possibility they will have to shut down one week later.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Why does the NFL not have a developmental league. Minor league football could be more popular than minor league baseball. I would watch minor league football in the spring, if I knew that the Steelers had certain players under contract. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, teams such as the Steelers have used the XFL and some of these other pop-up leagues almost like a developmental league. And they do have a minor league -- it's called college football <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, that's all the time we have today. Thanx for the questions. See you next week</p>
