<h1>National Aviary will reopen with new bird friends</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>More than 500 birds have been sheltering in place at the National Aviary for more than three months during the coronavirus pandemic. On July 1, they will be greeting the public when the North Side bird zoo reopens with safety limitations.</p>
<p>Look for Benito, the hyacinth macaw who hangs out in the Tropical Rainforest with Sapphira, who looks exactly like him. The staff says Benito likes people better than he likes other birds, so stop and talk to him. He will make eye contact with you, and he seems to listen to what you say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are new things to see. The crowd favorite Victoria crowned pigeons have a new chick, and the Grasslands habitat has renovated.</p>
<p>While the public has been shut out, the aviary staff has been caring for them, including a special bird named Dottie. The African penguin, endangered in the wild, became ill last October and was in the National Aviary’s intensive care unit with life-threatening pneumonia and a mass in her chest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Veterinarian Pilar Fish, the aviary’s director of zoological advancement and Veterinary Medicine, and other staff treated Dottie for many months. Key to her recovery was visits from her lifelong companion, Stanley. When staff couldn’t convince Dottie to eat, they brought in Stanley, and she ate when he ate.</p>
<p>Stanley ultimately moved in to intensive care with Dottie. He&nbsp;“vocalized” with her and groomed her.</p>
<p>On June 11, Dottie and Stanley made a triumphant return to the Penguin Point habitat.&nbsp;“With a waddle, hop and a splash, Dottie and her mate Stanley ... returned to a chorus of calls and brays from members of the colony,” according to the aviary news release.</p>
<p>So look for Dottie and Stanley, who is named for the Stanley Cup. OK, all the little black and white birds look almost exactly alike, but their names are on little “armbands” they wear on their wings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new online timed ticketing system will allow staff at the North Side facility to control the entry and movement of visitors. Masks and social distancing will be required. The tickets will be available later this month at aviary.org. The number of people admitted will be less than usual.</p>
<p>Visitors can also pre-book closeup animal encounters with a number of animals, including penguins sloths, hawks and owls.</p>
<p>National Aviary Members will be admitted June 28 to 30.</p>
<p><strong>Goat yoga</strong></p>
<p>The adorable goats of NamastHay Goat Yoga are back with social distancing in outdoor venues. They are taking their show on the road to Duke &amp; Lola’s Cafe in Mercer County for yoga on the shores of Lake Latonk on Saturday&nbsp;11 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Jen Stratakis of Jen’s Yoga Zen and Rainy Laux of Have U Herd Goatscaping have already had two local goat yoga sessions, to benefit local dog rescues. They’re working on scheduling more stress-busting sessions at the farm in Collier where the goats live. There will be another one in Mercer County on Sept. 13.</p>
<p>The versatile goats also hire out to eat weeds and invasive plants, including a gig at the University of Pittsburgh. They were recently hired for a bachelorette party.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">www.eventbrite.com</a>&nbsp;to order goat yoga tickets ($25) and to look for future goat yoga sessions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A portion of the goat yoga has always benefited animal rescues and shelters, but given the times, this one is helping Community Food Warehouse of Mercer County.</p>
<p>Yogis — the term for people who do yoga —&nbsp;bring their own mats to the outdoor venues and should wear masks until they position their mats in the field. Masks can be removed when everyone is 6 feet apart.</p>
<p>First-time yogis are welcome at NamastHay sessions as are people who are more experienced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goats don’t actually do yoga, of course, but they do meander amidst the mats and visit people, nuzzling them. The goats are friendly and like to be petted — somewhat like dogs. A popular part of these events are the end of yoga sessions when the goats pose for selfies with the yogis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Animal Friends gift</strong></p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Foundation has given a $150,000 grant to the Clinic &amp; Community Services Program at Animal Friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The grant “will support our lifesaving services over the next two years,” according to a news release from the organization that operates a shelter and other services in Ohio Township.</p>
<p>“With this much-needed funding, we can continue to provide affordable spay/neuter, health and wellness services and offer food for the hungry pets of our community through our Chow Wagon Pet Food Bank. We’re looking forward to continuing this relationship with The Pittsburgh Foundation to help more pets and people in our community than ever before.”</p>
