<h1>Colin Moran’s terrific start has given the Pirates plenty to ponder</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CHICAGO — Fresh off a season where he struggled defensively and saw his OPS drop from .815 before the All-Star break to .677 after it, optimism didn’t exactly abound for Colin Moran entering 2020.</p>
<p>It honestly seemed like the best thing the former first-round pick could do was keep third base nice and warm so a good chunk through this shortened season, whenever Super 2 status had been safely avoided, Ke’Bryan Hayes could arrive from Altoona, and the Pirates could start building for the future.</p>
<p>Now, if Moran’s terrific start continues, it’s hard to imagine a Pirates lineup without the lowest of low-key Pirates in it.</p>
<p>“It’s unbelievable,” Josh Bell said of Moran’s performance thus far, which includes him leading Major League Baseball in home runs with five. “Homers to all fields. Drawing walks. Laying off really tough pitches. He’s definitely locked in right now.”</p>
<p>One of the things that has benefited Moran has been a shortened stride, turning a leg kick into more of a toe tap. It’s something he watched Corey Dickerson do two years ago in Cincinnati, then put into practice over the summer while working out at his alma mater, the University of North Carolina.</p>
<p>There, Moran started to track exit velocity and began to see the numbers spike. He also started to feel comfortable.</p>
<p>“I was kind of playing around with it in the cage, and it felt good, felt natural,” Moran said. “All those numbers went higher, so I felt like I was putting more into the ball and maybe controlling it a little bit better than [with] a leg kick. I just kind of played around with it in the cages and felt something click. I’ve been trying to make sure that I’m consistently on time with it.”</p>
<p>After Saturday’s loss to the Cubs at Wrigley Field, Moran was hitting .321 (9-for-28) and had seven RBIs. The left-handed hitter has also produced a .625 average on breaking balls and ranks ninth in all of baseball in average exit velocity (96 mph).</p>
<p>It’s only been eight games, sure, but Moran has seemingly taken a giant step forward, the one that has been his focus since arriving at Pirate City in Bradenton, Fla. back in February.</p>
<p>“He has been a different guy since spring training 1.0,” said Pirates third-base coach Joey Cora, who works with the team’s infielders. “He came in with a purpose: to show people that he’s a much better player than he has been in the big leagues.</p>
<p>“He’s working his tail off. He’s finding information. He’s making adjustments daily. Not only offensively but defensively. He wants to show the world that he’s an every-day big league ballplayer.”</p>
<p>There are two important things to note here, both dealing with the simple truths of baseball: It’s still incredibly early, but if Moran can come anywhere close to maintaining this sort of pace, there’s no doubt he’ll be a daily presence in manager Derek Shelton’s lineup.</p>
<p>The question then becomes where.</p>
<p>It’s probably putting it kindly to say that Moran has been limited at third base. Of the National League third basemen who played at least 500 innings last year, nobody had a worse Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR) than Moran’s minus-8.8. The same for his number of Defensive Runs Saved, per FanGraphs, and it wasn’t close; Moran (minus-21) was more than three times worse than anyone else (Kris Bryant of the Cubs was worth minus-6 DRS).</p>
<p>The balls hit at Moran were generally fielded fine, but he struggled to show range, hence why he huddled with the Pirates analytics team this offseason and tried to gain an advantage. Moran learned about pitching plans and how hitters were attacked. He tried to anticipate more, theoretically improving his first-step quickness. Fielding on his backhand has been another focus.</p>
<p>While the results at third base have been good — no errors on nine chances in three games — they’ve also become less relevant. If Moran is averaging more than a home run every other game, he could jog out to the field with a shoe on his left hand, and Shelton might be OK with it.</p>
<p>“The one thing I notice with [Moran] is he puts a lot of pressure on himself in practice to be good, to be better every day,” Joe Musgrove said. “It’s something that I’ve adopted, just watching him work. Putting pressure on yourself in practice and forcing yourself to raise your expectations of what you can get out of it.”</p>
<p>There are many ripple effects of Moran potentially emerging as a bonafide slugger. For one, they would need to find him a position. Assuming he hits, Hayes is unquestionably a better defender. But with the designated hitter in play, it gives Shelton the ability to work Moran in there or potentially use him at first base and allow Bell to DH.</p>
<p>Whatever the result, the cascading affect starts with what we’ve seen thus far: Moran consistently mashing the ball at the plate, and he’s done that in an important way.</p>
<p>A focal point for Moran (and Shelton) this season has been not chasing spin pitches inside, a flaw that contributed to a 23.3% strikeout rate for Moran in 2019. That’s where the ludicrous average on breaking balls comes in. Obviously Moran isn’t going to maintain a .625 average on them, but if nothing else, it shows he’s capable.</p>
<p>Moran has maintained an aggressive approach at the plate, Shelton said, which has been a big key in his power surge.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing him take aggressive swings at every single pitch,” Shelton said. “The byproduct of that is we’re seeing him have success. He’s hitting the ball out of the ballpark and driving the ball. But I would be hard-pressed to say, watching him, that every swing he’s taken is not with intent and aggressive, and that’s what we challenged him on.”</p>
<p>Truth be told, Moran did not lack for challenges this season. A few months after his first child (a daughter, Oaklyn) was born, he was seemingly cast aside, his future with the Pirates assumed to be nothing.</p>
<p>But as the Pirates offense has sputtered, that has hardly been the case. Moran has thrived because of his own adjustments and the work he’s done with Pirates hitting coaches Rick Eckstein and Mike Rabelo.</p>
<p>“Yeah, more aggressive but I feel like I was pretty aggressive last year,” Moran said. “I just maybe fine-tuned some things in my swing, made some adjustments. I feel like every year the league makes adjustments to you, so just try to pay attention to what I did well, what I didn’t do well, how to capitalize on that and just trusting in guys. Working with Rick and Rabs, just feeling good.”</p>
