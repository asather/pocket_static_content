<h1>Joe Starkey’s mailbag: Does ‘Coach Randy’ have something against running the ball?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lucius Allen and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Deplorable SalidaSam, @salidasam:</strong> After last season, why does Coach Randy still believe that you can win in the NFL without a running game?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I’m not sure he believes that, Deplorable, although I would like to see the Steelers run more often and more effectively than they have the past two years, when their running game ranked near the bottom of the league.</p>
<p>Having said that, remember when they posted that six-game winning streak two years ago, the one that had everybody talking Super Bowl? They did so largely on James Conner’s back. He had 564 yards rushing in those games (a 1,500-yard pace). So it’s not like Coach Randy has no idea that running helps you win.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened next:</p>
<p>— They threw the ball a thousand times at Denver, but it really wasn’t a bad game plan. If Xavier Grimble and Conner don’t fumble in key spots (cross the goal line, Xavier!) and if Boswell kicks straight — and yes, if Ben doesn’t throw a late goal-line interception (“I wish we would've gone back to JuJu four straight plays,”) — they win that game.</p>
<p>— Conner got injured in the loss to the Chargers, one in which the Steelers put up 30 points.</p>
<p>— The running game fell apart, with the notable exception of Jaylen Samuels’ big game against the Patriots.</p>
<p>— The Steelers, in Fichtner’s first season, still finished sixth in the league in scoring — one of their best marks in 40 years.</p>
<p>Last season, teams simply stacked the box because they didn’t respect the Steelers’ quarterbacks. Some people believe you can run the ball effectively, over long stretches, against stacked boxes. They’re out of their minds.</p>
<p>Once in a while? Yes. Late in a game, when you have a team demoralized and weary? Sure. But as a game plan? As a strategy? Please. If the other guys have zero respect for your passing game, your running game is doomed.</p>
<p>Ben Roethlisberger will need a running game this season. The Steelers are intent on giving him one. We’ll see if Coach Randy &amp; Co. can deliver. And we’ll see if Ben’s on board with throwing less.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Shultz, @SouthsideShultz:</strong> What record of Lemieux’s will never be broken?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Team records? Where would you like to begin?</p>
<p>How about 199 points in a season? I’m guessing that one’s safe. I don’t think anyone’s going to approach 85 goals anytime soon, either. Seven of the 12 forwards who started the Penguins’ most recent game (Mar. 10 at New Jersey) didn’t have 85 goals<em>&nbsp;in their careers</em>.</p>
<p>Sidney Crosby is inching up on Lemieux in several career categories — but here are two records that will never be broken:</p>
<p>— Short-handed goals. Mario had 49. The next highest is 14 (Jean Pronovost, Ron Schock).</p>
<p>— Hat tricks. Mario had 40. The next highest (Evgeni Malkin) has 12.</p>
<p>As for league records, Mario still has the most short-handed goals in a season (13). Nobody has sniffed that since Brian Ralston had nine in 2001-02.</p>
<p>And of course nobody else has scored five goals five ways in a single game.</p>
<p><strong>JP, @PucksterPyro:</strong> Has Ron Cook interviewed Ron Cook yet?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> No, but we’re working on it. You speak, of course of Ron Cook Jr. (no relation), a sophomore running back for the University at Buffalo Bulls. Notice I said University ‘at’ Buffalo. This is a proper reference for my alma mater.</p>
<p>Awkward name, but proper reference.</p>
<p><strong>hebrew hammer, @hebrewhammer412:</strong> If there aren't fans at NFL games doesn't it become XFL? Of all sports football needs fans most. Without atmosphere it becomes Turkey Bowl minus the beers.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> It would be strange beyond strange, Hammer, but I wouldn’t be shocked if it happens. Billions of dollars are at stake, and the federal government wants football to happen. I still wonder: If the league doesn’t deem a game safe for fans, how is it safe for players, coaches, support staff, television workers, etc?</p>
<p>You know what, though? Just like the virtual draft, people would get used to fan-less football in a hurry. If they can still bet and play fantasy football, who needs fans?</p>
<p><strong>That_Guy_From_The_Burgh, @MattKappeler:</strong> How long can the NHL survive without paid attendance?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> It’s not like the NHL hasn’t survived such things before, That Guy. They’ve done it to themselves more than once, remember?</p>
<p><strong>Stu Ohler, @s_ohler:</strong> Bubble hockey or electric football?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I love this question dearly, Dr. Ohler. And it’s electric football all day long, even though bubble hockey is clearly a better game.</p>
<p>Electric football (tin field, plastic players who move when field is jolted with electricity) consumed years of my life. I would sprinkle the field with flour for snow games, turn off all the lights except for a flashlight for night games and tape offensive linemen arms with masking tape, like Gene Upshaw.</p>
<p>I eventually discovered that nobody could run straight for more than five yards, so each game was a series of 5-yard goal-line stands. Incredible. And a forerunner (sort of) to college-football’s overtime format.</p>
<p>Not that I dislike bubble hockey. Also spent several years doing that. Dr. Longstick, the right winger, set up most of my goals. I also created a rising slap shot from the left winger, who for me was Rick Martin. Many a seven-game series, fueled by Genny Cream and Sabres memories, were played in bubble hockey.</p>
<p>Sadly, due to my over-enthusiasm at the beginning of many games, I also had the career record for own-goals. The last thing you want to do in that game is have your defensemen manically attempt to clear the zone. The puck can bounce around and wind up in your net.</p>
<p><strong>Swissvale412, @Swissvale4121:</strong> With Cam [Newton] still out there and the price is right do we try and sign him?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Do they try? Probably not, Swissvale, but I would try. It’s amazing to me how many people watched last year’s season fall apart on account of tragic quarterback play (though I enjoyed Duck for a while) and are content with the exact exact same backup plan this season.</p>
<p>Some would say, “Sign Cam Newton? That’s ridiculous.”</p>
<p>I would say, “Keep the same backups after you saw what happened last year? That’s more ridiculous.”</p>
<p><strong>Chris Boehme, @Cboehme2:</strong> Is Scottie Pippen the greatest No. 2 player, or complementary piece to a championship dynasty that the NBA has ever had?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> The questioners came to play, I see.</p>
<p>He’s one of them, for sure, Chris. He was truly a great all-around player. But the greatest No. 2 player?</p>
<p>Either Shaq or Kobe had to be a No. 2, right?</p>
<p>Kareem was a No. 2 behind Magic, unless you consider Worthy a No. 2.</p>
<p>Bob Cousy was a No. 2 behind Bill Russell.</p>
<p>Kevin McHale was a No. 2.</p>
<p>So no, I cannot say unequivocally that Pippen was the best.</p>
<p>But thank you for asking.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Telek, @mktelek:</strong> Last Dance has been dope. What are some other sports documentaries you would suggest people should check out? Also what sad fact from your life would ESPN share if you were an NFL draft pick.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Other documentaries would include the 30 for 30 on N.C. State’s run under Jim Valvano (phenomenal), the Dr. J. doc on NBA Network and so many others. Those two spring to mind first.</p>
<p>Sad fact if I were drafted: “Once was a member of the Stevie Nicks Fan Club.”</p>
<p>Or: “On orthodontists’s orders, wore head gear to school in sixth grade. Also had greasy hair, translucent skin, acne and a terrible fear of girls.”</p>
