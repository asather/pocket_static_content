<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Point Park University on Monday announced plans for a nationwide search for a successor to Provost John Pearson, who has held the position since 2016 and is retiring.</p>
<p>The chosen candidate will begin work in early summer 2021, following Mr. Pearson’s departure at the end of the 2020-21 academic year, officials said.</p>
<p>Mr. Pearson shared his plans with the campus in February, though Point Park did not make a public announcement at the time, spokesman Lou Corsaro said.&nbsp;Mr. Pearson&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pointpark.edu/about/admindepts/marketingandcommunications/thepoint/currentfeatures/FeaturesSpring2016/ProvostPearson" target="_blank">came to Point Park</a> from Stetson University in DeLand, Fla., where he was vice president of academic affairs.</p>
<p>He could not immediately be reached for comment Monday.</p>
<p>“We are seeking a candidate with a strong record as a teacher and scholar, combined with a successful record of increasing responsible academic leadership and administrative experience,” said Paul Hennigan, president of Point Park. “This is a time of change, and we need a leader that can articulate and advance the university’s vision and strategy with energy, passion and decisiveness.”</p>
<p>The president added:&nbsp;“John is a passionate educator who has left an indelible mark on Point Park with his leadership and guidance.”</p>
<p>The private university Downtown has about 3,900 students in five schools, including its Conservatory of Performing Arts.</p>
