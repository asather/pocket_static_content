<h1>Pa. Turnpike permanently going cashless immediately; 500 collectors losing jobs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission decided Tuesday that it will permanently switch to cashless tolling immediately and begin laying off about 500 toll collectors and office personnel who process the cash payments in two weeks.</p>
<p>The agency, which has been <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/03/16/Pennsylvania-Turnpike-COVID-19-toll-collectors-toll-by-plate-no-cash-payments/stories/202003160104" target="_blank">operating without toll collectors since March 16</a> because of the COVID-19 virus, said it made the decision for three reasons: the cashless system has worked well during the pandemic; it has suffered huge financial losses due to reduced traffic; and it would be problematic to reopen cash tolling since an interchange would have to be closed for two weeks if a fare collector tested positive for the virus and the entire ticketing system would have to be shut down across the state if one interchange couldn’t operate.</p>
<p>The five-member commission approved the move Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>“I deeply regret that we have reached this point, but the world has been irrevocably changed by the global pandemic,” CEO Mark P. Compton said in a news release. “This pandemic had a much greater impact than anyone could have foreseen. The PA Turnpike has not been spared from COVID-19.”</p>

<p>The commission said it notified employees Tuesday morning and would begin processing layoffs immediately with the first ones beginning June 18. All full-time collectors had been moved to other jobs since March, but supplemental employees who work part-time or occasionally had been laid off.</p>
<p>“We were blind-sided,” said Dan Kozel, business agent for Teamsters Local 250 in Pittsburgh, which represents toll collectors in the western part of the state. “I feel bad for these people. At the time of a pandemic, they’re getting thrown out.”</p>
<p>The agency switched to cashless tolling in March to reduce social contact between motorists and toll collectors and help stem the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The decision moves the process for complete cashless tolling ahead by about 16 months since the agency was taking steps to eliminate all collectors by the fall of 2021. All drivers will pay tolls using E-ZPass or have a photograph taken of their license plate and receive a bill in the mail.</p>
<p>Since mid-March, traffic on the turnpike has been reduced by more than 50% at times, resulting in the loss of more than $100 million for the fiscal year that ended May 31. The agency has cut its capital budget by 25% (eliminating $147 million of construction projects), frozen hiring; offered buyouts; and told the state Department of Transportation it wouldn’t be able to make July’s $112.5 million payment for public transit.</p>
<p>“This is a painful day for all of us at the commission,” Mr. Compton said. “I want to thank these men and women for their dedication and hard work over the years; I assure them we will continue to assist them during this transition.</p>
<p>“From the start, we have taken a phased, deliberate approach to offset revenue loss that offers a degree of flexibility to adapt depending on the crisis’ duration. To date, the commission has taken several steps to cut costs. However, it has become clear these steps are not enough.”</p>
<p>The commission has joined similar agencies across the country lobbying Congress for stimulus payments to replace lost revenue but that hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozel said the union had agreed that toll jobs would be eliminated in fall 2021 and the turnpike had offered job training and education benefits for workers who were unable to line up a transfer to other state jobs. The agency has the same offer now, but Mr. Kozel questioned its value.</p>
<p>“All the stuff they were offering was good for down the road,” he said. “What good is it going to do when they’re out of a job in two weeks?”</p>
