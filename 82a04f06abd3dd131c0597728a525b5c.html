<h1>Three face homicide charges in death of 3-year-old in Oakmont</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police on Wednesday charged three people with homicide following the death of a 3-year-old in Oakmont earlier this month.</p>
<p>Officials said the child’s father, 29-year-old Jose Eduardo Salazar-Ortiz Sr., the child’s step-mother, 27-year-old Laura Michelle Ramriez, and Ms. Ramriez’s 20-year-old sister, Alexis Herrera, were responsible for the child’s death.</p>
<p>Detectives determined the child suffered from&nbsp;“prolonged physical and mental abuse” and arrested Mr. Ortiz and Ms. Ramriez; both are awaiting arraignment at Allegheny County Jail.&nbsp;An arrest warrant has been issued for Ms. Herrera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Officers first received a call around 1:54 p.m. on June 9 for an unresponsive child on the 500 block of 10th Street.</p>
<p>The child, Bella Seachrist, was found in the bathtub&nbsp;by police and paramedics, a criminal complaint states. They performed life-saving measures and transported the child to an area hospital, where the child was pronounced deceased.&nbsp;Investigators said the child was badly bruised and malnourished, and she showed signs of&nbsp;“extreme sexual abuse,” the complaint reads.</p>
<p>Detectives searching the residence found four young children who were living in the household; they were transported to UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh for interviews and physical examinations.</p>
<p>The complaint states interviews with Mr. Ortiz, Ms. Ramriez and Ms. Herrera, plus photo and video evidence, indicate there were multiple instances of physical abuse against Bella. One example involved Ms. Ramriez striking the child with a closed fist and knocking her unconscious. Another involved Ms. Herrera punching her in the face.</p>
<p>The women also allegedly bound Bella’s hands together multiple times. An instant message conversation depicts Ms. Ramriez and Ms. Herrera commentating, complimenting and narrating such an instance where Ms. Herrera was in charge of Bella, and the child was bound and put in a closet, the complaint reads.</p>
<p>Mr. Ortiz said he was aware Ms. Ramriez was abusive towards the child, the complaint says. Bella was sick before her death, and when Ms. Ramriez and Ms. Herrera returned to the the home after getting Chinese food, the child seemed to have “brownish-reddish” vomit coming from her mouth and wasn’t breathing.</p>
<p>All three adults were charged with homicide, criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault of a child, aggravated indecent assault of a child and endangering the welfare of a child. Ms. Herrera and Ms. Ramriez face additional charges of unlawful restraint and false imprisonment.</p>
