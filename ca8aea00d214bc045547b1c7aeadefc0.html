<h1>‘Aggressive swings’ spur Pirates to 13-9 victory against Blue Jays</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — The Pirates matched their highest scoring output during spring training in the first inning on their way to a 13-9 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday. The Pirates won their second game in a row after going 0-7-1 to start Grapefruit League play.</p>
<p>Bryan Reynolds drew a walk with one out in his first at-bat. Adam Frazier lined a double to center field that drove in Reynolds for the first run of the game. Reynolds showed speed and skill scoring from first base on the play.</p>
<p>Josh Bell and Gregory Polanco both got walked by Blue Jays' starter Chase Anderson to load the bases. Colin Moran doubled to bring Bell and Frazier home.</p>
<p>Cole Tucker went 2 for 3 with an RBI-double to cap off the first inning that saw the Pirates score four runs.</p>
<p>"It was fun to see our core group of guys have good at-bats," Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. "We a lot of guys take good and aggressive swings. We ran the bases really well. We had a couple of balls go over the fence. I'm happy with how that looked today."</p>
<p><strong>A bit of bad news</strong></p>
<p>Clay Holmes will be in a walking boot on his right foot for 4-6 weeks, Shelton revealed after the win. Holmes got hit by a line drive off the bat of Nelson Cruz the night before in a win against the Minnesota Twins. The move appeared to be a precaution. Sunday's evaluation showed the fracture. Pirates director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk will have more information when he addresses the media on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates scored 22 runs in their previous nine games before Sunday. Gregory Polanco had two walks and homered in the seventh inning. Pirates minor leaguer LoLo Sanchez followed Polanco's bomb with one of his own in the seventh. Two batters later, phenom Oneil Cruz hit a two-run home run.</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Joe Musgrove threw three innings and allowed two runs on two hits to go with two strikeouts. Musgrove had command of his pitches and was efficient. Kyle Crick pitched a scoreless seventh inning. Crick pitched for the first time since his season-ending injury last September.</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates used a four-person outfield during Cavan Biggio's at-bat in the third inning. Frazier left second base to play in left-center. Tucker moved to second. After the game, Pirates manager Derek Shelton told reporters that third base coach Joey Cora believed that it could work.</p>
<p>"It was a good pickup by Joey," Shelton said. "It was a good situation to try it. We had the right guys on the field to do it. We're going to do it during the season, and it was the perfect situation to practice it in."</p>
<p>Biggio walked, so there wasn't a play. However, Musgrove noted that Biggio hits the ball in the air 4 times out of 5 when he makes contact.</p>
