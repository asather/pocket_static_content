<h1>CARES Act funds help North Hills district maintain low class sizes, budget holds line</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Federal money under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act allowed the North Hills School District to adjust its proposed final budget to keep class sizes low while not raising taxes.</p>
<p>The previous budget included overriding the class size policy in some elementary grades to not hire more teachers. The district subsequently received $314,217 in additional federal money, as well as additional funds from the state.</p>
<p>“CARES Act money will ensure that can keep all of the classrooms in the class size policy,” said Annette Giovengo Nolish, chair of the board’s finance committee.</p>
<p>The board unanimously approved the final budget on June 11.</p>
<p>The $84.04 million budget keeps the tax rate at 18.65 mills.</p>
<p>“In what was anticipated to be a difficult budget year even before COVID-19, I am thrilled we were able to produce a balanced budget without a tax increase. It is the right thing to do for our community members during this extremely difficult time for us all,” said Superintendent Patrick J. Mannarino. “We are fortunate to have received federal and state funding that will provide relief to areas in the budget where we would have been otherwise forced to take a pause in growth.”</p>
<p>The budget does not include any furloughs, program or curriculum cuts. However, the district will not transfer funds into the capital fund for future projects this year.</p>
<p>The budget also includes adjustments because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The one-to-one iPad initiative will be expanded so students do not have to share devices. Also, the water fountains in all district buildings and at Martorelli Stadium will be replaced with water bottle refill stations, and students will be allowed to carry their own bottles.</p>
<p>The June 11 meeting was suspended, not adjourned, and will reconvene virtually at 7:15 p.m. June 30 to discuss other reopening plans. The plans will be voted on during the July 23 meeting that is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the middle school’s large-group instruction room.</p>
