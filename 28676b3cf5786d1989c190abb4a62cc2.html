<h1>Gene Collier: Legendary columnist finally misses a Super Bowl, but he knew what would happen</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>They played the Super Bowl without Jerry Izenberg last week so yes, that’s perfectly legal apparently, although no such thing had never been attempted, much less in Miami.</p>
<p>“I’m the only Jew who ever turned down a free trip to Miami,” he growled when I called him this week. “But I’m 89; it was time to grow up.”</p>
<p>A wise-cracking omnipresence at major sporting events for most of the past seven decades — he was in the press box for the first 53 Super Bowls and the last 10 NFL championship games that preceded them — the decorated columnist of the Star-Ledger in Newark, N.J., immediately flashed back to a moment when he was forced to consider that his streak would not last forever.</p>
<p>He put it in his column, which he still writes from his home in the Las Vegas Valley.</p>
<p><em>“Once upon a time, the late Pete Rozelle, former NFL commissioner, would gather all the charter members of the Super Bowl survivors group -- sportswriters who had covered every Super Bowl -- for drinks and the unbridled swapping of lies at what he called The Super Club. There were about 30 of us back then. I remember one time when Pete got up to speak.</em></p>
<p><em>“I look around and it’s so good to see you again," he said. "But then I think about the faces that are gone and that makes this a bittersweet occasion.”</em></p>
<p><em>In response, I rose to offer our appreciation. What he got was the Jersey version of a thank you.</em></p>
<p><em>“Hey, Rozelle, what kind of happy hour are you running here? First you tell us we’re gonna die. Then you serve cold hors d’oeuvres and watered-down drinks. How the hell do I get out of this chicken (expletive) club?”</em></p>
<p><em>Regretfully, I have found a way.</em></p>
<p>Izenberg got out very much alive. He wrote 75 columns last year, 36 of them on the road. Among his 15 books is a recently completed novel, “After the Fire,” based on the 1967 Newark riots, which he covered. But as they say about all the great ones, the legs go first. The truth is he fears being knocked down and/or trampled, either by a thoroughbred in the stable area at Churchill Downs (he’s covered every Kentucky Derby going back 50-something years) or by a herd of sportswriters headed for a Super Bowl buffet.</p>
<p>His absence in Miami left Jerry Green of the Detroit News the last newspaper guy to have covered every Super Bowl.</p>
<p>“I called him during the game,” Izenberg said. “I told him, ‘there’s no ceremony for this, but I want to turn over sole propriety of the Super Bowl attendance record.’ Jerry’s 91. Other than that, there’s no one there for me to argue with. They’re all dead.”</p>
<p>Seeing Izenberg in the week leading up to an event virtually validated the thing’s importance. As the Star-Ledger’s star columnist, he wrote about the things the country cared about most. Not just Super Bowls and the Derby, but all those World Series, and all those big fights, later re-energized in “Once There Were Giants,” his book about the golden age of heavyweight boxing.</p>
<p>But last Sunday he finally encountered what was, for him, an unprecedented sports experience: He watched the Super Bowl on TV.</p>
<p>“Tell you the truth, I got over all this stuff about going or not going, and I was really watching the game,” he marveled. “It’s funny; I did 53 Super Bowls and this was one of the handful that I really wanted to see because, going in, they don’t play the game on paper, but (the matchup) was so intriguing. It worked out fine for me. I was lost in it.”</p>
<p>I asked if he watched the halftime show. He’d always been very proud of the fact that he’d never seen one because he was always working.</p>
<p>“Yes I finally saw a halftime show, but I quit as soon as they all started jumping around like cows with overactive thyroids. It’s an age difference I guess. Didn’t impress me. So I got up and got a hot dog.”</p>
<p>When you’re as smart as Jerry Izenberg and you’ve written so many columns about so many historical events, you’re eventually walking around with a knowledge base and a perspective that can’t be easily replaced. I sat down with him in San Francisco four years ago while I was writing a long piece on the 50th anniversary of the Super Bowl. He deftly produced an anecdote from Super Bowl I, before they even called it the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>He said he had breakfast with Chiefs linebacker E.J. Holub two days before they played the Packers. You couldn’t do that now without a SWAT team.</p>
<p>“I asked if he was any more nervous for this game than a regular game,” Jerry remembered. “He stretched his hands across the table at me, palms up, and says, ‘Feel them.’</p>
<p>“So I did. They were soaked. ‘You’re sweating,’ I said.</p>
<p>“ ‘Darn right,’ he said. “ ‘If we win, we each get $15,000, and my wife’s already spent it.’ ”</p>
<p>Fifty-four years later, Izenberg ended another pregame column like this:</p>
<p><em>They (the 49ers) could keep it close early because Andy Reid, Shanahan’s coaching counterpart, doesn’t generally take risks. He settles for field goals. But don’t sell him short. A Hall of Fame candidate, this might be his legacy game.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s up to Mahomes to bring it home.</em></p>
<p><em>I like the Chiefs, 31-20.</em></p>
<p>Final score from the first Super Bowl without Izenberg: Chiefs 31, 49ers 20.</p>
