<h1>Major League Baseball is back. So, now what?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The financial wrangling is over. Health and safety protocols have been developed, tweaked and agreed upon. Rules and roster limits have been adjusted to reflect the difficulty of playing during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball, even though it seemed like this day would never come, is officially back, with players expected to report for spring training 2.0 by July 1 and Opening Day scheduled for July 23 or 24.</p>
<p>The path here has been a long and winding one, filled with arguments over money and rejected proposals between owners and the MLB Players Association. Even the final hurdle of agreeing on logistics took a good four hours after MLB commissioner Rob Manfred’s deadline of 5 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
<p>But after the union informed the league that its members intended to arrive on time for spring training — 103 days after the last one was halted — the two sides got to work on how to restart and play a season as safely and effectively as possible.</p>
<p>It will feature a 60-game sprint of a season that will occur over nine-plus weeks, and likely all of them to be played in ballparks devoid of fans.</p>
<p>“Major League Baseball is thrilled to announce that the 2020 season is on the horizon,” Manfred said in a statement. “We have provided the [MLBPA] with a schedule to play 60 games and are excited to provide our great fans with baseball again soon.”</p>
<p>Much like this entire thing, it’s not ideal. And it’s likely not over. By letting Manfred implement a season, the MLBPA preserved its right to file a grievance, which some analysts have estimated could be worth as much as $900 million should the players win.</p>
<p>For now, however, it’s on baseball to make the best out of what it is, to change the conversation from its contentious labor talks and salary squabbles to on-field play and give Americans a much-needed diversion from COVID-19.</p>
<p>The shortened season gives anyone a chance — yes, even the Pirates. And if the two sides can figure out a way to expand the playoffs beyond 10 teams, something that fell off the table when they couldn’t agree on a proposal, the season could be even more competitive.</p>
<p>But none of that matters if the league can’t effectively combat or contain COVID-19, so it’s probably best to start there by focusing on the health and safety measures teams and players will have to take.&nbsp;Keep in mind these are rough since there has not yet been an official announcement:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Social distancing wherever possible, which could turn the stands into de facto dugouts. Basically anywhere but the game itself, players, coaches and staff members are encouraged to keep 6 feet of space.</p>
<p>• No high-fives, hugs or spitting of any kind.</p>
<p>• Players were previously instructed to avoid showers and sharing an Uber or taxi.</p>
<p>• Temperatures will be checked throughout the day, and COVID-19 tests will be performed a couple times per week.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Players who are deemed “high-risk” can opt out and still receive their salary and service time. Ditto for anyone who lives with someone who’s “high-risk,” including a pregnant wife.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of players and employees will remain MLB’s foremost priorities in its return to play,” the league said in its statement. “MLB is working with a variety of public health experts, infectious disease specialists and technology providers on a comprehensive approach that aims to facilitate a safe return.”</p>
<p>There will also be a variety of changes to how business is conducted in this shortened season, and many of those were leaked to national baseball writers as news broke.</p>
<p>The biggest might be a COVID-19 injured list, first reported by ESPN’s Jeff Passan, which will include players who test positive, have confirmed exposure or are showing symptoms of the virus. Unlike the 10- or 60-day injured lists, there will not be a specific number of days players must spend on it.</p>
<p>There will also be a trade deadline, according to Jayson Stark of The Athletic. It will be on Aug. 31 — or roughly 35 games into the season.</p>
<p>Stark also tweeted some roster-related changes, including starting the season with 30-man rosters, then cutting those down to 28 after two weeks and 26 after four weeks.</p>
<p>Spring training 2.0 can include as many as 60 players, or teams can choose to send up to 20 players (who aren’t on the 40-man roster) to an alternate site. Pitchers and catchers, per usual, will report first, and not all 40-man roster players have to be invited (but still must be paid).</p>
<p>To be eligible for the postseason, players must be added to the big-league roster by Sept. 15.</p>
<p>With transactions, the ongoing roster freeze will be lifted at noon Friday, teams must submit their 60-man player pool names by 3 p.m. Sunday and teams can take three extra players (called a taxi squad) on the road.</p>
<p>There will also be rule-related issues, which were funneled through Bob Nightengale of USA Today. Extra innings will start with a runner on second base. The designated hitter will be used in the National League.</p>
<p>While the financial parts of this back-and-forth were difficult, the rest seemed to come together rather smoothly.</p>
<p>“The league and teams share our best interests,” one Pirates player said. “It’s a win-win for everyone if players are staying on the field.”</p>
<p>It will also be a victory for both sides if the sport can thrive during this unique time in the sports landscape.</p>
<p>In addition to hopefully talking about expanded playoffs, both sides would surely benefit from broadcast enhancements such as players wearing microphones and conducting in-game interviews, another piece of shrapnel from the deal that never happened.</p>
<p>Interviews and insight could be fun. Fans could engage a little more, and that’s important because baseball must resell its game and its stars.</p>
<p>The schedule will be yet another factor, as that must be created from scratch.</p>
<p>With 60 games against nine teams, MLB will go with a 40-20 split favoring division opponents, with 10 games against those four clubs and four against the five from the other league.</p>
<p>It also has a little over nine weeks to schedule those games, meaning teams will get only six off days on 66 dates.</p>
