<h1>North Hills school board OKs policy on members’ social media </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The North Hills school board has adopted a policy that governs board members’ online behavior.</p>
<p>The policy, which was approved at the board’s Jan. 2 meeting, mirrors similar policies for students, staff and administrators.</p>
<p>“We have to start somewhere, and this is a great start,” said board member Annette Giovengo Nolish. “We hold our staff and students accountable for social media, but I think we should hold ourselves accountable as well.”</p>
<p>The short policy tells board members to avoid posting any information that violates the state school code or district policies, and recommends that any page or post that discusses district issues include a disclaimer that the opinion is that of the board member only.</p>
<p>But some members said the policy should do more.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t go far enough to protect the district,” said board President Allison Mathis. “It is a little too vague.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Mathis said there are many things that could be added, such as joining groups on Facebook that discuss local politics and issues.</p>
<p>Superintendent Patrick Mannarino told board members that they could revise the policy after it is passed.</p>
<p>Members voted 8-0 to approve the policy. Kathy Reid was absent.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the idea of not having a policy out there right now, but I definitely think we should look at this some more,” said Helen “Dee” Spade, board vice president.</p>
<p>In other business, the board honored Joe Welch, middle school social studies teacher, who was named 2020 Pennsylvania Teacher of the Year.</p>
<p>The program, which is co-sponsored by the state Department of Education and the Pennsylvania chapter of the National State Teacher of the Year, honors outstanding public school teachers.</p>
<p>As teacher of the year, Mr. Welch will represent the state at the National Teacher of the Year ceremony at the White House and will be the keynote speaker at various education events.</p>
<p>“I have a sense of pride to North Hills, and I can’t wait to share that with the rest of the state,” Mr. Welch said.</p>
<p>He is North Hills’ third state Teacher of the Year, joining Lois Rebich, a reading specialist at Ross Elementary School, and Fred Del Monte, a former director of bands and orchestras.</p>
<p>Mr. Mannarino said the district will install a recognition wall outside of the large group instruction room at the middle school, where most board meetings are held, for the three teachers.</p>
