<h1>Dallas County orders residents to stay home as Texas’ governor issues new restrictions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Residents of Dallas County, Texas, have been ordered to stay home except for work and essential errands.</p>
<p>County Judge Clay Jenkins announced the shelter in place order, including the stoppage of all businesses not deemed essential, early Sunday evening. The order takes effect at 11:59 p.m. Monday. It's the first Texas county to take such measures.</p>
<p>That same day, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued two executive orders Sunday, directing health care providers to postpone surgeries and procedures that aren't medically necessary and waiving regulations in an effort to increase hospital capacity. But despite growing calls from hospital heads and mayors, he said a statewide shelter-in-place order was not yet needed for Texas.</p>
<p>Dallas County announced 36 additional coronavirus cases earlier Sunday, raising the total to 131.</p>
<p>"This order is our best chance to flatten the curve here in Dallas County and save as many lives as possible. It makes me sick that we're at this point," Jenkins said. "It doesn't matter if your job is in Fort Worth or whether your job is in downtown Dallas or Plano, if you live here, you're under this order."</p>
<p>Exercise and walking dogs outside are still allowed, but people must stay at least six feet away from one another. Restaurant delivery and pickup service is still permissible. Grocery stores may remain open.</p>
<p>Religious services can only be televised and staff must be limited on-site to 10. All elective surgery and dental work has been postponed until further notice.</p>

<p>State representatives from the county and surrounding areas praised the move.</p>
<p>"As a community spread area, the stay-at-home order is our best bet to flatten the curve and manage the rising threat this disease presents to each and every person in our county," state Rep. Victoria Neave, D-Dallas, said in a statement. "I strongly encourage all residents of Dallas County to follow his declaration carefully -- for the safety of yourself and your fellow Texans."</p>
<p>Said state Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, in the release: "Judge Jenkins' decisive leadership will save lives. Absent clear direction from Governor Abbott, it is up to our local officials to make the hard choices to protect the public health."</p>
<p>For Abbott’s part on Sunday,&nbsp;his first executive order gave physicians the discretion to suspend procedures that aren't medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition or to preserve the lives of a patient, he said. The executive order notes that the restrictions will not apply to procedures "that would not deplete the hospital capacity or the personal protective equipment needed to cope with the COVID-19 disaster."</p>
<p>The second executive order suspends certain regulations to allow hospitals to treat more than one patient in a room, "thus increasing their ability to care for the growing potential number of COVID-19 patients," Abbott said Sunday from the Texas Capitol.</p>
<p>The executive orders take effect immediately and will be in place through midnight April 21.</p>
<p>The additional executive orders follow Abbott's sweeping executive order that went into effect midnight Friday that temporarily closes all Texas schools and gyms, prohibits dining-in at bars and restaurants, limits social gatherings to 10 people and restricts visits to nursing homes through April 3.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, a handful of governors ordered their residents to stay home to limit the virus' spread. Meanwhile, Abbott was adamant when he announced the statewide restrictions last week that they were not a shelter-in-place order.</p>
