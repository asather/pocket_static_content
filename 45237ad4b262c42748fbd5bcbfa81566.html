<p>DENVER (AP) — The Denver Nuggets have promoted Calvin Booth to general manager.</p>
<p>Booth, 44, is in his third season with the Nuggets after being hired as assistant general manager in 2017. He succeeds Arturas Karnisovas, who left Denver in April to become the Chicago Bulls’ top decision-maker.</p>
<p>Booth played college basketball at Penn State, where he was the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year in 1998. He was drafted by the Washington Wizards in 1999, beginning a 10-year playing career with seven teams.</p>
<p>After a decade-long NBA playing career, Booth served as a scout for the New Orleans Pelicans in 2012-13, followed by a four-year stint in the Minnesota Timberwolves’ front office, first as a scout and then as director of player personnel.</p>
<p>Tim Connelly, the Nuggets’ president of basketball operations, called Booth “one of the brightest basketball minds in our league,” and added, “We are very fortunate to have him as part of our organization and are extremely excited for his new role.”</p>
