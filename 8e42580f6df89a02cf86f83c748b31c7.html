<h1>TRAFFIC: Two I-579 ramps will reopen Friday morning</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PennDOT officials announced Thursday that the ramps from 7th Avenue and Bedford Avenue to I-579 southbound will reopen at 6 a.m. Friday morning.</p>
<p>The ramps have been closed since Jan. 4 as crews began work on the I-579 “Cap” Urban Connector project. Crews constructed the last pier and columns, relocated drainage channels and reconstructed the pavement on the ramps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single-lane closures on the ramps will occur in the future as work on the project continues. Commuters can sign up for email I-579 traffic advisories and construction by sending an email to stcowan@pa.gov with the subject line “Subscribe – I-579 Cap Project.”</p>
<p>The $29.34 million Urban Connector project consists of a three-acre public green space spanning I-579 to link downtown with the Hill District. Construction was originally anticipated to conclude in November of 2021.</p>
<p>The Joseph B. Fay Company is the prime contractor.</p>
