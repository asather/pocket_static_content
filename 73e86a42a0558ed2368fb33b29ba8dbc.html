<p>Officials with Joe Biden’s campaign announced Sunday that the Democratic presidential nominee will travel to southwestern Pennsylvania on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details with the exact time and location of where Mr. Biden will appear were not immediately disclosed in the campaign’s press release Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Hill, the Biden campaign’s deputy national press secretary, tweeted Sunday that the former vice president is traveling to southwestern Pennsylvania on Monday “to lay out a core question voters face in this election: are you safe in Donald Trump's America? As Trump fan the flames of division, Biden will offer a different vision for a better future in Joe Biden's America.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Sunday night, President Donald Trump tweeted that Mr. Biden&nbsp;“is coming out of the basement” and going to Pittsburgh, although officials have yet to confirm where he will visit.</p>
