<h1>Casey: Congress must pass emergency spending bill to prevent spread of COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Warning that the federal government is not yet taking the necessary actions to address the growing threat of COVID-19, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey said Wednesday it’s vitally important that Congress passes an emergency spending bill.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey, joined by two prominent health care officials on a conference call with reporters, said although public health experts are continuing to assure the general public that the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus remains low, the federal government is in the early stages of fighting its spread and must remain “vigilant.”</p>
<p>“We’re not there yet,” Mr. Casey said. “The federal government is not taking the actions that are needed right now.”</p>
<p>Vigilance includes passing the multibillion-dollar supplemental appropriations bill that’s currently in negotiations between parties, Mr. Casey said. After the senator’s Wednesday morning conference call, congressional negotiators from both parties reached an agreement on a spending bill totaling about $8 billion, with more than $3 billion allocated for vaccine research and development and $2.2 billion to new public health funding, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/03/04/congress-coronavirus-emergency-spending/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_funding-115p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans&amp;itid=hp_hp-top-table-main_funding-115p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans" target="_blank">according to The Washington Post.</a> The House will vote on the deal on Wednesday and the Senate on Thursday, with the goal of getting it to President Donald Trump’s desk by the end of the week, The Post reported.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey had hoped that a bill could pass both chambers by the end of next week, and touted a proposal by Senate Democrats calling for $8.5 billion in funding -—close to the number of the eventual bipartisan agreement.</p>
<p>For now, President Donald Trump must do a “better job” of conveying accurate information to the public, Mr. Casey said —&nbsp;noting that he doesn’t believe the administration was adequately prepared to combat the virus.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey said he’s concerned about the availability of test kits, and hopes there will be enough available by the end of this week. Only then can the federal government begin to understand how many people are infected.</p>

<p>“We don’t know that yet,” Mr. Casey said. “We have numbers that don’t reflect the reality of those affected.”</p>
<p>Patrick J. Brennan, chief medical officer and senior vice president of the University of Pennsylvania Health System, said there have been more than 20 individuals who have come through his system’s hospitals —&nbsp;“for whom there was a sufficient degree of suspicion” that they could have had the virus —&nbsp;and were isolated.</p>
<p>Upon evaluation, none of those individuals went on to the official coronavirus testing stage, Dr. Brennan said.</p>
<p>There are currently no confirmed cases of the virus in Pennsylvania, officials said, though Mark Ross of the The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania said a “number of individuals” have been tested and “a number of tests” are awaiting return.</p>
