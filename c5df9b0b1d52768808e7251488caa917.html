<h1>Pennsylvania's National Guard active in food deliveries  </h1>

<p>As the Pennsylvania Army National Guard truck arrived at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh on Monday afternoon, the Rev. Elizabeth Mayforth saw a woman follow along as it made its way around the building to deliver pallets of food.</p>
<p>The woman had been preparing to take her infant home after two months in the neonatal intensive care unit, said Rev. Mayforth, a chaplain at Children’s, and she needed the assistance. The Guard members also brought a load to the nearby Ronald McDonald’s House, where families of patients were&nbsp;“overjoyed,” she said.</p>
<p>The Guard team drove from Harrisburg with supplies of shelf-stable food to numerous Pittsburgh-area distribution points, including a church in Verona, a community center in Penn Hills and the Energy Innovation Center in the Hill District, said Capt. David Boyes, public information office for the Guard’s Task Force West.</p>
<p>Food deliveries are dispatched from Harrisburg based on requests approved by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. Rev. Mayforth said she put in the request for a delivery at Children’s so that anyone with financial needs during the coronavirus crisis could receive some help. “My intent was&nbsp;to support patients, family, employees and staff,” she said.</p>
<p>That delivery amounted to the equivalent of more than 3,000 meals, with large amounts also delivered to the other distribution points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The delivery was conducted by the Williamstown-based 131st Transportation Company, part of the Guard’s Task Force Support.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Guard members distributed more than&nbsp;326,000 meals between April 13 and Friday, said Duncan Williams of the task force.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty cool,” he said. “The soldiers are really motivated to help out.”</p>
