<h1>House subcommittee seeks bid documents from Pittsburgh company over COVID-19 contract</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee is seeking bid solicitation documents, communications with federal employees and other information from a Pittsburgh company that received a $10.2 million government contract to track COVID-19 related data.</p>
<p>In a letter to Downtown-based TeleTracking Technologies Inc., James Clyburn, chair of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, said the committee was probing the government’s contract with the company, which replaced the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s role in collecting and publishing the information from 6,200 hospitals nationwide.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services awarded the contract, removing the CDC and raising questions among researchers and others about the timely disclosure of the information.</p>
<p>Mr. Clyburn’s July 28 letter was addressed to TeleTracking Technologies Chairman and CEO Michael Zamagias. The company did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.</p>
<p>Amesh A. Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, was among the researchers who questioned the change in reporting requirements for hospitals.</p>
<p>“The concern is the politicalization of the outbreak and the marginalization of the CDC,” he said. “The question is always going to be, what’s prompting this change in the middle of a pandemic?”</p>
<p>The subcommittee has asked for submission of the materials and a briefing with staff members by Aug. 11.</p>
<p>In a July interview with New York City-based health care media company MedPage Today, TeleTracking President Christopher Johnson said no one in the Trump administration had tried to manipulate COVID-19 data or “unduly influence” the operations of the new HHS Coronavirus Data Hub.</p>
<p>“It’s been very, very clear since the beginning that the goal has always been transparency,” he said.</p>
<p>TeleTracking Technologies operates the HHS Coronavirus Data Hub, which on Thursday reported that 79% of Pennsylvania’s 206 hospitals had submitted COVID-19 data in the previous week, with just 7% of hospital beds statewide occupied by patients with the disease.</p>
<p>A total of 4.3 million COVID-19 cases have been reported nationwide with 148,866 deaths.</p>
<p>Mr. Clyburn, in his letter to TeleTracking Technologies, said that a public database identified the government’s contract with the company as a sole-source award, but the database was altered to state that the award was the result of “full and open competition” on July 17, the same day the subcommittee sought information about the contract from HHS.</p>
<p>“This sudden decision raises questions as to how your company received this contract and what steps you are taking to ensure the public retains full and complete access to this critical data,” he wrote.</p>
