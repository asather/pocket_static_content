<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 02.13.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, we're going to start our chat in just a few minutes so get ready.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Alright, I got my coffee (that might not be strong enough for this) and I'm ready to go. Shoot....</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: Any word on Diontae Johnson's health after that photo of him in a hospital? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: None, but I wouldn't worry about it. Guys have surgery after the season all the time.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: Brees, Rivers &amp; Brady are no longer elite. How can any new team convince themselves they are worth $25M+? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That is your opinion they are no longer elite. But, to your point, the Chargers obviously didn't think Philip Rivers was.</p>
<p><strong>Mountain man</strong>: It seems everytime we see Ben in public he looks bigger and fatter than the last time. Is he not involved in any fitness routine at all right now? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It's the beard and heavy clothing. But, c'mon, because of his elbow, there are a lot of things he is unable to do right now other than ride a bike.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony</strong>: When will the Steelers start cutting players? Chickillo? Barron? Foster? Etc <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: When they have to get in compliance with the cap.</p>
<p><strong>Ashley</strong>: Whats Oittsburgh's plan B for if Ben cant play anymore? Rudolph and Duck are awful. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Rudolph and a veteran quarterback with starting experience are Plan B.</p>
<p><strong>TomCool</strong>: Do future/reserve signees receive any money before the NFL season starts? Thanks Gerry! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not sure about that. I don't think so, at least, not until OTAs or training camp. But I'll have to check.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Do the Steelers still think Gentry can be a viable TE? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He's only been with them a year so I don't think they are ready to give up on him.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin</strong>: What do you think of AB's apology tour? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Same as I think of everything he says -- nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Who might get new contracts or extensions before training camp for Pittsburgh? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Cam Heyward.</p>
<p><strong>Alex</strong>: Any chance Burns returns in 2020? Davis? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: None. And none.</p>
<p><strong>Hank</strong>: What position would you take with the 1st 2picks in the draft for Pitt this year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: RB and TE, unless they sign a TE in free agency. And then it would be RB and WR. Either way, skill players.</p>
<p><strong>Picksixlisberger </strong>: Gerry, Worst case scenario: Roethlisberger can’t come back from current injury and has to hang it up. How much of a cap hit would he remain and for how long? How would an injury buyout affect the cap? Thank you. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They would be on the hook for two years of his pro-rated signing bonus, or $25 million.</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: Hi Gerry, do you get the sense that the Steelers will look to add to the RB room early in the draft? Or would it be much wiser to wait until later to address the position? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I get a good sense. And I've said many times, they don't need a running back, they need a No. 1 running back. They got plenty of RBs.</p>
<p><strong>Dick</strong>: The Steelers are likely going to lose Hargrave, Matakevich, Foster and a few others. Do the Steelers have quantifiable replacements? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think they are losing sleep at the possibility of losing any of those players you mentioned. The ,one possible exception is Hargrave, whom they would like to retain. Do they have a quality replacement? No, which is why, even if does come back, they need to draft a defensive lineman to improve their depth for rotational purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Gerry, I have heard that we got the Dolphins 4th pick that they got from Tenn. However 2 weeks ago Labs said in his chat that it was the Dolphins actual 4th pick. I can't find the answer anywhere yet. That is a difference of about 20 some spots. Do you know? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I would imagine it's Miami's actual 4th-round pick.</p>
<p><strong>Emilio</strong>: Gerry, Michael Irvin 65 TD 750 Rec 5 probowls 11 year career and a few hundred yards less With best OL maybe ever vs Hines Ward who has 20 more TD 250 more Rec 4 Probowls 14 years in league, best blocking WR maybe ever, not athletically gifted as many WR in HOF, great smarts, great dedication, efforts and study for his shortcomings athletically compared to others.. in my view give me Hines everyday Instead of Michael On my team and HOF credentials no to say Hines played most years with a Running team.. if Irvin is a HOF, Hines MUST also!! Am I wearing B&amp;G glasses? Who you think is more deserving? Thanks <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not going to argue with you. I'm not saying Michael Irvin isn't deserving because he is. But I think what Hines brings to the table is 1,000 catches, Super Bowl MVP and he changed the rules because of his tenacious blocking.</p>
<p><strong>greg in lewisville, texas</strong>: Gerry, This is a request, not a question.......back in the '60's, the Pittsburgh Press, on the Sunday edition, during football season, would print the Steeler roster along with the opponent roster. It contained the players number, name, position, height/weight, years in league and the college they were drafted from. It was a clip and save for every Steeler fan watching the Steelers on Sunday on a black and white TV. . Any chance the PG could provide this same information starting this year for the Steelers 2020 season? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I remember those days, but I don't think they are coming back, at least, not in the Sunday paper. In case you haven't noticed, the size of the Sunday paper, like it is everywhere, keeps getting smaller so space becomes a premium. And something like a roster is going to be left on the editing room floor, as they say.</p>
<p><strong>LC’s Yellow Cleats </strong>: Mr. Dulac, With the defense looking as the strong suit of the team, will #7 buy into running the ball for the good of the team and his arm or will it be throw, throw, throw? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They are not just going to become a run-oriented team, if that's what's you're asking. But that doesn't mean they won't try to run the ball better and a little more often. The game plan will always revolve around Ben, but that doesn't mean he or the team just wants to throw, throw, throw, as you say.</p>
<p><strong>John T</strong>: Gerry, realisti how comp will ghe team be in 2020 for the divis title? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Depends on Ben, but they should be right there if he is healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Robert</strong>: Is Mason Rudolph currently showing evidence that he is doing EVERYTHING that he possibly can to develop his talent and skill to allow himself to become the Steelers next franchise QB after Roethlisberger? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: We don't see any of the players this time of year, so whatever he is doing is not known to us. But Mason is a film junkie who works very hard on the playbook. I'm sure he is doing that and more. But, remember, he had that clavicle surgery after the NYJ game that was going to sideline him for 6 weeks. Plus, it's not like he is allowed to work out with the coaches and his teammates this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>Robert</strong>: With technology advancing as it is, will the NFL adopt use of RF or other exact spatial position tracking applications in the ball abdon the field markers to better assure officiating related to ball placement calls? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They should. But does baseball?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry </strong>: I saw Ben at a college game last night. I understand its the off season. Why does he look like a OL instead of a Quarterback? All the time off he has had you would think he would at least be in shape!!#IJS <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Uh....elbow surgery. Plus, he is a big boy anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Robert</strong>: Is Merrill Hoge more right or wrong in his skepticism on CTE hazards of playing football? What is the NFL's stance in light of his rebuttal that CTE science may be bogus with conflated study outcomes? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: If you read his book (and I'm guessing you did), you will see, based on the evidence, he is right. He is not saying concussions don't happen or that head injuries can't happen. He is saying there is tons of evidence by neurosurgeons nationally that does not to support the CTE hysteria that is being advocated by a certain doctor that was played by Will Smith. And the NFL along with the medical community continues to study the issue.</p>
<p><strong>2daysTomsawyer</strong>: question: have we seen the acceptance now of merge of positions in NFL where QBs are RBs and wide receivers are taking handoffs and DE is OLB and RB needs to run routes? all to provide the flexibility to mis-direct and out chess match?Its been awhile since a TE wanted paid as WR but isn't that where it has gone? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There are only a few instances in the league where the QB is like the RB. But all the other positions have been like a hybrid anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Stefan</strong>: Good morning Gerry. Can you gauge the interest of the Steelers in Hunter Henry or Austin Hooper? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't know that yet but I would imagine they are considering the possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Robert</strong>: What do you enjoy most about the game of football and why? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The magnitude of the games.</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong>: Who is the top FA on the market this year that you think the Steelers should consider signing. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: A tight end, and I think you might see that happens. Don't be surprised to see a backup D-lineman get signed in free agency also.</p>
<p><strong>Heath Miller Fan</strong>: Gerry, thanks for the chat. Do you realistically see the Steelers releasing Barron &amp; McDonald? And, which position would you likely see them pursuing in free agency? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't realistically see that happening at all, even if they sign a TE in free agency.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha</strong>: Hi Gerry...do you think the Steelers will keep OL Finney or does he sign elsewhere? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they will keep him. They do not have a backup who can play guard and center.</p>
<p><strong>PA Texan</strong>: To me, folks are way undervaluing the play and roles of Barron and Edmunds. These hybrid players are the key to modern NFL defenses, the swiss army knives if you will. They are asked stop the run and cover backs, TEs and WRs as well. If they have to cut Barron, even with expected improvement of Bush, I think they must address this box-safety, light-LB position early in the draft. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They are not going to address that position in the draft, I will tell you that. And I don't think Mark Barron is any danger of being cut. He and Devin Bush play the majority of the snaps. The guy who plays the fewest snaps who makes a lot of money is Vince Williams, who counts only slightly less than Barron against the cap. Williams doesn't play nearly as much as he used to because of their reliance on sub package football.</p>
<p><strong>thomastown</strong>: Once upon a time, the Steelers had 3 young receivers (Wallace, Sanders and Brown). Now they have JuJu, Washington and Johnson. How do you compare the two groups at this early stage of their careers? The only thing that comes to my mind is that Wallace was a very good deep threat that they don't seem to have now. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The three current players obviously have to go a long way to compare to the other 3, but when you look at their production in each of their first two years in the league they are ahead of Wallace, Sanders and AB.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: Why does the NFL not adopt a turkey gobbler type chin/jaw/neck protector that hangs down from the face mask like catchers have in baseball? At least for quarterbacks. It seems like this would reduce concussions cause by helmet shots to the chin and jaw. If a catcher can wear it with a 100 MPH fastball coming at him surely it would not affect a qb's vision. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Because quarterbacks are running around and catchers aren't. That thing would flap in their face if they started to run or move around.</p>
<p><strong>Robert</strong>: JuJu, Dionte J., and James Washington are young talents. JuJu is proven. I'm convinced his struggles this past season are more attributable to substandard quarterback play and his injuries and less about Antonio not being there and pulling double coverage. What are your thoughts about the prospects of these three young wide receivers being good enough to fill the Steelers needs at their position as starters? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they are fine and having Ben back will show that. But I would still not pass on a WR if they thought a good one was there in round 2. Always remember, they never turn their back on a quality skill player.</p>
<p><strong>PA Texan</strong>: More and more teams are adding the jet-sweep type plays to at least keep defenses off balance. Do you think Johnson has the ability to be this kind of player, a sort of Tyreek Hill light? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The Steelers have that. But what I think they need to do is add more motion to their pre-snap to try to free up their receivers more and create some space.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: From best to worst which qb would give the Steelers the best shot at a Super Bowl this season? Big Ben? Philip Rivers? Tom Brady? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The guy they have.</p>
<p><strong>Robert</strong>: How much does Mike Tomlin and his coaching staff influence the scouting? Is Tomlin as the head coach the person who heads up the scouting effort or is it more of a joint effort between him and Kevin Colbert that then gets delegated to the Scouting Department? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Tomlin and Kevin Colbert make all the decisions. They use the scout's reports as supplemental information or to further pursue a player to see what he has. But Colbert is the lynchpin and together he and Tomlin decide what they want to do.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: What do you make of Garrett's racial slur accusation of Rudolph? I think maybe his teammates know him and know it is not true but what about the rest of the NFL and general public/fans? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Look at the evidence. There is none.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: " .... there are a lot of things he is unable to do right now other than ride a bike."<br> How about eat less? That usually works. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'll tell him</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Dupree had a great season last year in comparison to several mediocre years before. Do you think its fair to say the coaches knew last season's Dupree was there all along, he was just waiting to emerge? Or were they as surprised as everyone else? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they knew it was in there and they were waiting for it to come out. So, in that manner, they weren't surprised, just glad.</p>
<p><strong>Jake</strong>: Gerry, Why the delay naming in the WR coach? Waiting on Ben's approval I guess. Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not sure. I was told any day now. But it has nothing to do with Ben. He has nothing to do with any staff decision.</p>
<p><strong>KB</strong>: How Rudolph’s recovery from his season ending injury coming? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not sure because we haven't seen him.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: Which FA TEs are worth pursuing? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Hunter Henry would be a good start.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: I’ve become convinced that the national media’s speculations about the Steelers is wrong more often than not. Woyld you say that’s right? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I would say that is 100 percent right</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Gerry, In the land of what ifs, would you draft Tua if available in the 2nd rd? Upside is huge. Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I wouldn't because their window to get to the Super Bowl is open now and closing soon.</p>
<p><strong>LetsBeReal</strong>: Is there something in the water at the PG that makes the writers there delusional enough to think this team has any chance of competing for a championship within the next 5 years? We have a terrible OC, a 38 year old QB whose clearly out of shape with a slim chance of being anywhere near remotely productive after a major elbow surgery on his throwing arm, no running game, aging and worsening O-line, No TE, bad and ineffective WR's, no cap room because they constantly over pay aging players for past performance and they eat up cap as they get older and worse, and the QB's in the pipeline wouldn't even be practice squad players on 30 other teams in the league. Isn't the beat writers job to be honest and objective? You guys are just homers and you either blantantly lie to the consumers or you don't actually know anything about football. This team has no chance of even sniffing a Lombardi for years. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't drink their water. I suggest you try switching whatever it is you ingest. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: And with that, we will end our chat. Thanks for the (mostly good) questions.</p>
