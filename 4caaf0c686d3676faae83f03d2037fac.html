<h1>PNC scaling back branch service amid pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PNC, Pittsburgh’s biggest bank, said Thursday it will begin operating on a primarily drive-up only basis beginning Friday to help stop the spread of the novel coronavirus while minimizing disruption to customers.</p>
<p>The changes will take place across all markets. PNC has roughly 2,400 branches, including about 130 in the seven-county Pittsburgh region.</p>

<p>PNC said about three-quarters of its branches will offer drive-thru service only, while most of the rest will remain closed until further notice. Select branches that do not offer drive-thru services will stay open on an appointment-only basis to ensure access across communities, the bank said.</p>
<p>Drive-thru service will operate from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Friday, and from 9 a.m.-1 p.m. on Saturdays. PNC’s branch locator is available at <a href="https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.html" target="_blank">www.pnc.com</a>.</p>
<p>Appointments will be available for customers requiring safe deposit box access, loan closings or other banking services that cannot be delivered through the drive-up, telephone, ATM network or via mobile or online banking. Appointments should be made by calling the most convenient branch office.</p>
<p>PNC spokeswoman Marcey Zwiebel said no layoffs were planned.&nbsp;“Employees will be working on a rotational, split-shift schedule. We have communicated all of the details with them,” she said. Employees who are off rotation and are at home will continue to be paid.</p>
<p>“Great consideration went into these decisions and we are confident in our ability to seamlessly deliver through these changes with minimal disruption,” the bank’s CEO, Bill Demchak, said in a statement. “We also have the capital and liquidity to continue to meet the needs of our entire customer base.”</p>
<p>Customers who are struggling financially because of the pandemic are urged to call customer service at 888-762-2265 to discuss options, PNC said.</p>
