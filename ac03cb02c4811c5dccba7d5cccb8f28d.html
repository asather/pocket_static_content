<h1>CVS Health to open two COVID-19 testing sites in North Hills</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Drugstore chain CVS Health will open nine COVID-19 test sites in Pennsylvania on Friday, helping expand access to screening for the highly contagious respiratory disease.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh-area testing sites will be on Duncan Avenue in McCandless and William Flinn Highway in Hampton.</p>
<p>Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based CVS Health will open the CVS Pharmacy drive-through testing sites, with the goal of having up to 1,000 testing sites open across the country by the end of May. The nine test sites in Pennsylvania are part of a rollout that will include 51 sites in Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Rite Aid Corp. has been offering tests at some of its locations for several weeks.</p>
<p>At the CVS sites, appointments are required and people being tested must meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and age criteria. The CDC testing guidelines include symptoms of the disease, including shortness of breath, fever and cough, the elderly and health care workers who may have been exposed to the disease.</p>
<p>Patients will be required to stay in their cars and will be directed to the pharmacy drive through window, where they will receive a test kit and instructions.</p>
<p>A CVS pharmacy team member will observe the self-swab process to ensure it’s done properly. There are no out-of-pocket costs for getting the test.</p>
<p>“While the large scale test sites we’ve been operating since early April have proven successful, this new approach allows us to utilize our presence in communities across the country and bring testing closer to home,” Pittsburgh native and CVS Health CEO Larry J. Merlo said in a prepared statement.</p>
