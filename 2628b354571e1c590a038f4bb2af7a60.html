<h1>Penn Hills man sues Indiana, Pa., police on excessive force claim</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Penn Hills man has sued the borough of Indiana, Pa., and three police officers there, saying they injured him in a 2018 scuffle over some beef jerky he shoplifted from a Sheetz.</p>
<p>Matthew Forbes of Penn Hills, a basketball player listed on the 2019-2020 roster for Pennsylvania Highlands Community College in Johnstown, filed the claim Thursday against the borough, Officer Joshua Henning and two other officers identified only as John Does.</p>
<p>Mr. Forbes said he and two unnamed friends stopped at a Sheetz on Oct. 28, 2018, to get food for himself and one of the friends, identified as "Friend A." Another man, "Friend B," the driver, went into the gas station also but didn't get food.</p>
<p>Mr. Forbes paid for his food and that of Friend A prior to receiving their order. While waiting for their food, Mr. Forbes also picked up a bag of beef jerky but did not join the payment line because the line was long, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>After they got their food, the three men began to leave. Outside they found police waiting for them. One of the officers asked if they had paid for all their items. Mr. Forbes said he didn't pay for the beef jerky.</p>
<p>"[Forbes] apologized for his action and offered to pay for the bag of beef jerky," the complaint says.</p>
<p>An officer said Mr. Forbes and Friend A could leave but a citation would be sent to them in the mail.</p>
<p>Mr. Forbes and Friend A said Friend B didn't have anything to do with the theft, so an officer asked him to leave. Friend B, however, said he couldn't leave without the others since he was the only person who could get them back to their college in Johnstown.</p>
<p>Friend B was holding his phone as if he was recording, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Officer Henning then raised his voice and said something like "now they are going to jail," the complaint says, and tried to put Mr. Forbes under arrest.</p>
<p>The suit notes that Mr. Forbes and his friends are black and the officers are all white.</p>
<p>One of the officers grabbed Mr. Forbes' arm to handcuff him and used more force than necessary since Mr. Forbes was not resisting, according to the suit. The officer and Officer Henning then slammed him into the wall, after which Officer Henning wrapped an arm around Mr. Forbes' head and yanked it backwards while placing his other arm around Mr. Forbes' throat, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Officer Henning put Mr. Forbes in a headlock and stomped on his right foot, the complaint says. When Mr. Forbes asked why the officer had stomped on his foot, he said Officer Henning replied that it was because Mr. Forbes was trying to run.</p>
<p>While the scuffle ensued, the other officers did not intervene to stop Officer Henning.</p>
<p>"In fact, the police officers made what was should have been peaceful into a chaotic, violent arrest that ended with plaintiff being injured," the suit says.</p>
<p>The officers put Mr. Forbes in a patrol car and took him to the police station, where Officer Henning told another officer that Mr. Forbes was "going crazy" and that he wanted to "zap him" with a Taser, according to the suit.</p>
<p>Mr. Forbes was charged and released and later went to a hospital for neck and foot pain. He said he was given a neck brace and an air boot. He kept having pain and went back to the hospital a few days later, where he said he was diagnosed with muscle and tendon injuries of the neck.</p>
<p>The complaint says Mr. Forbes was the starting guard for his basketball team and the injuries caused him to miss five games.</p>
<p>"Plaintiffâ€™s ankle has not been the same since that incident as it is weaker and more susceptible to injuries and he still experiences pain in his neck area," the complaint says.</p>
<p>The suit claims excessive force under the Fourth Amendment, assault and battery and failure by Indiana Borough to properly train police.</p>
<p>The solicitor for Indiana did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
