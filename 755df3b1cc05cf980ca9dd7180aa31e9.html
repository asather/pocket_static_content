<h1>Virginians line up to cast ballots on first day of early voting </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Voters stood in line for up to four hours in the Northern Virginia suburbs Friday morning to cast ballots in a bitterly contested presidential election.</p>
<p>In heavily Democratic Fairfax County, the state’s largest jurisdiction, the wait had stretched to four hours by midday, officials said.</p>
<p>By noon, 300 people had cast their ballots, county officials said, with at least 300 more standing outside on the government center front lawn, several camped out on lawn chairs.</p>
<p>“Oh well,” said Janine Marie Gillis upon being told about the wait when she arrived at the end of the line.</p>
<p>Ms. Gillis and several other voters at the end of the line said they were energized about the chance of voting out President Donald Trump. Although early voting will continue thorough Oct. 31, with several satellite locations opening in Fairfax on Oct. 14, those voters said casting a ballot on the first day had symbolic value and would show others that the process works.</p>
<p>Stephanie Simper, 38, said she would be casting her first ballot ever in a presidential election for Mr. Biden.”I just always went with the flow with whoever the president was,” she said. “But you can’t do that anymore.”</p>
<p>Kate Hanley, the secretary of the county board of elections, said the county would be adding a second room with ballot machines to speed the line up.</p>
<p>“We knew it would be busy but didn’t expect it would be quite this busy,” Ms. Hanley said. “Typically, we expect this kind of turnout on the last day of absentee in-person voting, not on the first day.”</p>
<p>Several voters said they felt a sense of urgency this year, enough to wait in line with others who weren’t always standing more than 2 feet away from each other.</p>
<p>Others said they had planned to vote by mail but became increasingly worried about that process amid Mr. Trump’s unfounded allegations that mailed voting would be “rigged” and reports that the U.S. Postal Service wouldn’t be able to process absentee ballots in time for them to be counted.</p>
<p>“I don’t want my vote to be thrown away,” said Adam Pierre, 57, who was voting early for the first time ever. “It’s worth the risk. It’s just mind-boggling to hear how our big kid of a president would go out and put out all kinds of lies and trash and say it’s a rigged system. It’s a big concern for me.”</p>
