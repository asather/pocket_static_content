<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh has opened a dormitory on campus for UPMC medical personnel to aid in the fight against the new coronavirus, COVID-19.</p>
<p>Pitt has opened Lothrop Hall, a residence hall with an adjoining skybridge to UPMC&nbsp;Presbyterian Hospital in Oakland, as “no-cost, convenient housing” for area health care workers, university spokesman Kevin Zwick said via email.</p>
<p>Zwick also said the dorm had been “cleaned and sanitized, and several area healthcare workers have taken up residence in the facility.”</p>
<p>Lothrop Hall has single and double-occupancy rooms for up to 723 residents as well as a communal kitchen, according to the university.</p>
<p>Pitt chancellor Patrick Gallagher first announced the opening of Lothrop to medical personnel during a university Senate Council meeting on Thursday, The Pitt News <a href="https://pittnews.com/article/156384/top-stories/senate-council-discusses-coronavirus-effects-at-pitt/" target="_blank">reported</a>. Gallagher also said opening&nbsp;additional halls to patients is under consideration and that Lothrop is being cleared of any remaining student residents.</p>
<p>Kenyon Bonner, Pitt’s vice provost and dean of students, announced in in an email Wednesday that the university’s physical campus in Oakland would transition to providing only essential functions such as housing and carry-out dining services for students unable to go home.</p>
