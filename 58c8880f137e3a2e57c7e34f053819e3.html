<h1>Carnegie Mellon weighs fall options including delayed start as it grapples with COVID-19 impact </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University is weighing fall semester options including a delayed start, and it will implement measures to stem financial losses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, from a hiring freeze and suspension of merit increases to salary-givebacks by its president and other leaders.</p>
<p>President Farnam Jahanian briefed the campus on a crisis that has roiled higher education, including his university with nearly 15,000 students, affecting areas from research and admissions to the value of the university’s endowment as it and other campuses moved to remote-only instruction.</p>
<p>Mr. Jahanian’s outline, released by the university Tuesday, comes as heads of other leading institutions have announced similar moves both nationally, and locally, including the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Mr. Jahanian said refunds to students sent home early from dormitories and other expenses now top $28 million in the current fiscal year, “not including any anticipated losses of future revenue.”</p>
<p>Mr. Jahanian expressed optimism that social distancing measures are bearing fruit in metropolitan areas where Carnegie Mellon has a presence, but he also said the school must consider the global nature of its student population and operations in considering the pandemic’s spread.</p>
<p>The nation’s testing and tracing capabilities are a factor as well, he said, in weighing the viability of a return to normal.</p>
<p>“While we stand prepared to resume in-person, on-campus operations, we are closely tracking the situation as it unfolds and incorporating new information into our planning of various potential scenarios,” he wrote. “Working closely with the academic and administrative leadership, including the deans and department heads, we have created contingency plans.”</p>
<p>He identified those as three working scenarios: A fall where in-person instruction is delivered as usual; another where&nbsp;“we would push the semester back by two to six weeks”; and a hybrid of in-person and remote instruction where “even if some students, faculty and staff can return to campus” others unable to return would learn remotely and “some portion of the faculty and staff will continue to work remotely.’’</p>
<p>Mr. Jahanian said expense reductions would be implemented, including the amounts that Carnegie Mellon now pay top leaders, including himself and Provost James Garrett.</p>
<p>“The provost and I have&nbsp;committed to take a 10% reduction in our salaries for the next academic year,” he said. “Our vice presidents, academic deans and chief investment officer also have volunteered to reduce their salaries by 5%.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of January, a Chronicle of Higher Education presidential pay survey put Mr. Jahanian's base salary at $580,521 out of total compensation of $806,131 as of 2017, the most current year available.</p>
<p>Mr. Jahanian said all areas of campus will be asked to look for ways to streamline.</p>
<p>“Although there are no plans for across-the-board layoffs or furloughs at this time, units may need to make decisions regarding staffing to reduce expenses in anticipation of revenue losses,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Jahanian said the university must safeguard its future financial health, and he cited the wide-ranging impacts of both the virus itself and the drastic impact on the nation’s economy, including millions with one or both parents unemployed.</p>
<p>It also requires understanding how many students will enroll this fall, from where and the difficulty they may have reaching Pittsburgh, especially from overseas.</p>
<p>‘First, the university’s primary source of revenue is tuition, which accounts for a significant fraction of our operating budget. Furthermore, we anticipate the need for significant increases in financial aid, especially for returning students whose families may be under new financial stress because of the pandemic and the slowing economy,”&nbsp; he said. “As an institution that is committed to the accessibility of a CMU education, we are committed to meeting these needs as best as we can and ensure that all deserving students can continue to pursue their dreams at CMU.”</p>
<p>He said the uncertainty will impact areas from campus housing and dining demand to science.&nbsp;“We may see a potential flattening of our sponsored research programs,” he said.</p>
<p>“I share this information with you, not to heighten your anxiety, but rather to be candid about a reality we must confront with the same ingenuity and resourcefulness we have always exemplified as Tartans,” he wrote. “I also want to give you the proper context for the short- and immediate-term decisions we need to make to secure our long-term success and ensure the continuity of our societal mission.”</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon has 14,800 students on its main Pittsburgh campus, Silicon Valley, Qatar and other global locations, as well as online learners, according to university data. It has more than 1,300 faculty and staff.</p>
