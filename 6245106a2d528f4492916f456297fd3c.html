<h1>Erik Gonzalez (finally) in much different place for Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Erik Gonzalez watched Phillip Evans and Gregory Polanco collide while chasing a foul ball Aug. 8, it produced flashbacks of his own encounter with Starling Marte last April, the one where Gonzalez fractured his collarbone and lost his starting job.</p>
<p>As Gonzalez silently worried for Evans, he couldn’t bring himself to budge from third base, wary of creating too much of a scene around the injured Pirate.</p>
<p>“I didn’t go to where the accident happened in the outfield because I feel like I know how he feels in that moment,” Gonzalez said. “That happened to me, so I didn’t want to be around him. … I know how [unfortunate] it can be.”</p>
<p>The figurative picture from that day perfectly describes what Gonzalez has experienced thus far in 2020: Now removed from his own horrific injury, the 28-year-old former Cleveland Indians prospect has suddenly become what the Pirates’ former regime thought he could be, before he was hurt.</p>
<p>Entering Wednesday’s game against his former team, Gonzalez was hitting .389 (14-for-36) over his last nine starts and .326 (15-for-46) in 12 starts overall. Whether it’s been at third base or shortstop, Gonzalez has flashed some slick defense, but it’s his hitting that has turned heads, specifically an increase in power.</p>
<p>Although it’s still only 20 games into the season, Gonzalez has produced an average exit velocity of 93.2 mph, a sizable increase from the 87.4 mph he averaged in 2019. Meanwhile, his launch angle has ticked way up, from 4.5 degrees in 2019 to 11.7 this season.</p>
<p>“I made a couple of adjustments,” Gonzalez said. “Before, my swing was a little bit long. Now, I’ve got a short swing to the ball. That’s helped me [generate] more velocity. Everything that’s happening how is because of something I’m doing to my mechanics.”</p>
<p>Gonzalez and hitting coach Rick Eckstein have actually worked to retool his swing a couple different ways.</p>
<p>After watching video recently, Gonzalez noticed he was too upright and unable to cover the outside part of the plate. That was an easy fix. Another has been trying to use his back leg more, waiting on the pitch and driving it instead of getting out in front and sacrificing his power.</p>
<p>It’s showing. After producing six extra-base hits in 142 at-bats last season, Gonzalez already has seven in just 48 in 2020, including six doubles in his last nine games and a 463-foot homer on Aug. 8 against the Tigers.</p>
<p>“When I go to home plate now, I feel like I can hit a home run every time,” Gonzalez said. “I feel strong in my lower body. My swing is short to the ball. I feel really, really, really good.”</p>
<p>Gonzalez certainly wasn’t feeling good at this time last season, after he had endured the first of two surgeries. The first procedure was an open reduction internal fixation to repair and stabilize his fractured left clavicle. The second came Nov. 13, 2019, when Gonzalez had another procedure to fix a fractured first ray in his left foot.</p>
<p>Even though Gonzalez had a strong September, hitting .322 over 63 plate appearances, with a new general manager in Ben Cherington coming in, Gonzalez faced an uphill climb for playing time.</p>
<p>After all, it wasn’t Cherington who traded for Gonzalez; it was Neal Huntington, giving up Max Moroff and Jordan Luplow to do it.</p>
<p>And with Colin Moran, Kevin Newman, Adam Frazier and Josh Bell seemingly entrenched in the infield, prospects for playing time looked bleak. To his credit, Gonzalez has taken a sliver of an opportunity and made the best out of it.</p>
<p>“If you play well, no matter who’s the general manager or manager, you're going to be in the lineup,” Gonzalez said. “So, I don't think about too much about that.”</p>
<p>Maybe not, but Gonzalez has enjoyed the regular playing time, which he was supposed to get last season. Being in the lineup most days — he got the day off Wednesday — has allowed Gonzalez to make adjustments on a game-to-game basis, something he said he really enjoys doing.</p>
<p>“When you play every day, you can make adjustments,” Gonzalez said. “If I do something [poorly] one day, I can do it better the next.</p>
<p>“I need a chance to play because I did it in the minor leagues and know that I can do it in the big leagues, too. I’ve waited for that moment all my career.”</p>
