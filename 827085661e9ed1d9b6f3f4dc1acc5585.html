<h1>Robert Morris dominates at home, punches ticket to NCAA tournament</h1>

<p>Jalen Hawkins was standing on the bench before the game was over, waving a towel.</p>
<p>Dante Treacy, who finished the game with 18 points and five assists and won the NEC tournament most valuable player award, was pumping his fists at the student section under the basket as time was running out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Josh Williams, the fifth-year senior guard who has had chance after chance at the NCAA tournament but has always fallen short, was hugging everyone he could.</p>
<p>Then the buzzer sounded, and it was a mob scene.</p>
<p>No. 1 seed Robert Morris dominated Saint Francis, 77-67, winning the Northeast Conference tournament and clinching a spot in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2015.</p>
<p>“You put in the work year after year, you come up short, and you just want to get a taste of what it’s like,” Williams said after the game.&nbsp;“I was finally able to do that, and it feels so good.”</p>
<p>“All the sacrifices we made, not just myself, the coaches, my other teammates, this is the moment we all wanted,” junior guard Jon Williams added.&nbsp;“And to share it with them, it’s special. It’s so special. It hasn’t even kicked in all the way, but it’s so special.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The defining run of the game came at the beginning of the second half. The Colonials held a nine-point advantage out of the break, but after five minutes of play in the second half, that lead was stretched out to 17 points. Treacy, who led Robert Morris offensively all game long, hit the big bucket of the run, stepping into a 3-pointer from the right wing to extend the lead to 15 at the time.</p>
<p>The Red Flash hung around for a time, making small runs to keep a reasonable doubt on the outcome, but the Colonials always had the big shot to answer.</p>
<p>When Saint Francis cut it to an 11-point game with 12:23 left, Jon Williams led a fast break for Robert Morris. His brother, Josh, trailed behind him, shouting to make sure Jon knew he was there. He did and found Josh, who hit a 3 to bring it back to 14.</p>
<p>Then, when the lead was cut to 12 with 6:17 left, Williams hit three free throws and junior forward AJ Bramah threw down a two-handed, putback dunk to bring the gym back to life.</p>
<p>And with less than three minutes to go, Williams hit one more 3 to make it a 16-point game, taking all doubt out of the ending. It was appropriate it was Williams so many times, as he has set the tone for this program since transferring here two years ago.</p>
<p>“When Josh got here, we were a .500 team,” coach Andy Toole said after the game.&nbsp;“And coming from a winning program and all his life being a winner, he started to set the tone, and then guys were able to follow. So like I said, it’s an unbelievable feeling. These guys will be walking on clouds for the next seven to 10 days, and they should, because this is an unbelievable moment for them.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the environment present in UPMC Events Center to start the game — it was sold out for just the second time this season — it seemed likely that the Colonials would come out energized, and that’s exactly what they did.</p>
<p>With Saint Francis putting a defensive emphasis on stopping Josh Williams, Robert Morris looked inside at the beginning of the game. Senior center Yannis Mendy scored eight early points, helping to get the Colonials’ offense moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>The real ring leader in the first 20 minutes was Treacy, though. He was Robert Morris’ most consistent option, as he found guys cutting through the lane and hit some crafty layups as well, leading the Colonials to a 34-25 lead at the break.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes of game time later, it was an early celebration. The Colonials won comfortably on Tuesday and will move on to play in the NCAA tournament for the ninth time in school history.</p>
<p>“I was so excited. This is really the best moment of my life, I swear,” Bramah said after the game.&nbsp;“I don’t even know what to say.</p>
<p>“... We knew that we are a very talented team, and we just got it done.”&nbsp;</p>
