<h1>Girls highlights: Rochester knocks off Vincentian, wins ninth in a row</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rochester had never played in a WPIAL girls basketball championship game before beating West Greene in the final last season.</p>
<p>Now the Rams are hungry for a return to the championship, and they took their first big step on that path Monday night.</p>
<p>MeKenzie Robison hit a go-ahead 3-pointer for what turned out to be the winning basket as Class 1A No. 1 Rochester (11-1, 5-0) won its ninth consecutive game and took over sole possession of Section 1 with a 72-69, double-overtime victory at No. 2 Vincentian (7-2, 3-1).</p>
<p>Corynne Hauser scored 23 points and Alexis Robison 22 to lead the Rochester attack, while MeKenzie Robison finished with 13. Tara Lucot led all scorers with 25 for the Royals in a losing effort.</p>
