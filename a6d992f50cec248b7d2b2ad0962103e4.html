<p>The Pittsburgh Sewer and Water Authority will put the microfiltration plant in Highland Park back into service this week after a three-year, $14 million investment project that brought the plant up to stricter state quality standards.</p>
<p>The project improved the plant’s treatment methods, rehabilitated the microfiltration system and improved security around the Highland Reservoir No. 1, according to a release from the PSWA. Construction began in 2017.</p>
<p>The microfiltration system at the plant will now include ultraviolet light disinfection technology in the treatment process in addition to membrane filtration. This is an additional barrier against microorganisms in the water.</p>
<p>Because the reservoir is open to the air, the water is not considered potable and must be treated before distribution.</p>
<p>The plant will be able to treat up to 20.8 million gallons of water per day and will serve about 250,000 customers. The Highland Reservoir No. 1 provides water to 11 city neighborhoods as well as storage tanks such as the Garfield Tank.</p>
<p>“Completing the improvements at the [microfiltration plant] will ensure high quality drinking water that meets or surpasses all drinking water standards for over 250,000 residents,” said Will Pickering, Executive Director of PWSA, in the release.</p>
<p>“Reopening this unique and state of the art treatment plant allows us to focus on other previously-deferred critical projects. We appreciate our customers’ patience as our team of engineering, construction and operations experts continues to aggressively modernize our water system.”</p>
<p>Rebecca Zito, a spokeswoman for PWSA, said the walkway around the microfiltration plant and reservoir will remain closed until mid-August. A contractor is currently restoring the plant’s parapet wall and will completely resurface the walkway.</p>
<p>“Once that’s repaved, the community shouldn’t see a patchwork of two different types of concrete. It should have a uniform look,” Ms. Zito said.</p>
<p>PSWA has plans to spend an additional $312 million on other large system projects in the future.</p>
