<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>St. Benedict the Moor Church,&nbsp;a landmark in the Hill District, will return to its status as a separate parish with an express mandate to continue its longstanding mission of serving the black Catholic community, Bishop David Zubik announced Friday.</p>
<p>The church had long been a separate parish but was merged in January with two nearby churches to form Divine Mercy Parish as part of a sweeping program of mergers throughout the diocese.</p>
<p>However, after further consultation with church members, Bishop Zubik agreed to a task force recommendation to create a&nbsp;“personal parish” based at St. Benedict. A personal parish responds to a particular culture or need, whereas a territorial parish, which St. Benedict used to be, serves a geographic area. Even as a territorial parish, given its location in the Hill District, the church has long been a hub for African-American Catholics. It is located across from Freedom Corner, a civil rights landmark.</p>
<p>The task force was created following a meeting between Bishop Zubik and parish members in February, where they spoke about St. Benedict’s unique role in serving African-American Catholics.</p>
<p>“Along with their sincere enthusiasm and passion for their Catholic faith, I heard and felt their desire to have their unique spiritual and cultural needs met,” Bishop Zubik said in a statement. “I want to raise awareness of the need to walk with our black sisters and brothers as they continue to enrich and be an integral part of the Diocese of Pittsburgh and the Catholic Church Universal.”</p>
<p>The move takes effect July 13, the day after Bishop Zubik plans to visit the church, barring any pandemic-related restrictions.</p>
