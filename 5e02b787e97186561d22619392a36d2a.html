<h1>Gerry Dulac's Top 5 Masters: A final major roar for golf's Golden Bear</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette golf writer Gerry Dulac has covered 27 Masters, including the past 22 in a row, and would have been at the Augusta National Golf Club this week if the first major of the season wasn’t postponed until November. This week, he’ll rank the Top 5 Masters tournaments in his professional lifetime.</em></p>
<p>There are moments in life that never will be forgotten, events that trigger memories of where you were and what you were doing. Sports have had several, maybe.</p>
<p>Golf has had one.</p>
<p>Every golfer who has ever teed a ball remembers what happened on April 13, 1986, the day Jack Nicklaus, at age 46, put on the grandest back-nine charge in the 83-year history of the Masters and won his sixth green jacket, his 18th and final major championship.</p>
<p>Nothing has topped it since, not Tiger Woods’ epic victory at the Masters in 1997, not his <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/golf/2020/04/10/masters-moments-tiger-woods-coronavius-canceled/stories/202004100046" target="_blank">return to glory in 2019</a>. And nothing is likely to top it in the future. It remains the greatest moment in Masters history, an epic thriller unlike any other.</p>
<p>“Most Sundays at Augusta are so different for the viewers and the fans, particularly because of the roars and excitement, all the birdies and eagles,” said two-time U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange. “But, that day, it was special because of who was doing it. I’m not really the sentimental type, but I do get that way in this situation.”</p>
<p>Nicklaus — golf’s Golden Bear — started charging up the leader board during the final round, making three consecutive birdies, beginning at No. 9, turning the normally behaved patrons at the Augusta National Golf Club into frenzied Black Friday shoppers.</p>
<p>When he made an eagle-3 at No. 15, eliciting a roar that reverberated through the valley, Masters decorum went out the window. Intoxicated with what they were witnessing (and perhaps something else), patrons began racing from hole to hole — a no-no at Augusta National — hoping to catch a glimpse of Nicklaus pulling off what would become maybe the greatest moment in golf history, if not all of sport.</p>
<p>“People were running everywhere,” said Australian Nick Price, who was playing in the final twosome with Greg Norman, four groups behind. “You saw all of the guys just running, trying to find a spot because they knew it was something magical that was happening.”</p>
<p>Even Price could feel the electricity in the air as he made his way through Amen Corner. As he walked down the 15th fairway, he looked over to the adjacent 17th green and saw the top of Nicklaus’ head. It was right when Nicklaus was about to attempt the 11-foot birdie putt that probably has been replayed more times than any other stroke in golf history.</p>
<p>Then, in a moment freeze-framed in his mind, Price saw the top of Nicklaus’ left arm raised, putter extended in triumphant conquest. The earth shook.</p>
<p>He couldn’t hear CBS announcer Verne Lundquist’s now-famous call — “Yes sir!” — but all of America did. And nobody, it seems, has forgotten.</p>
<p>“Incredible atmosphere,” Price recalled years later. “I don’t know how to say it. Even when I won my majors, it didn’t feel anything like that — that atmosphere.”</p>

<p>It has been 34 years since Nicklaus walked off the 18th green with his son and caddie, Jack II, each with an arm draped over the other’s shoulder. More than three decades after he shot 30 on the back nine for a final-round 65 and beat some of the best players in the world — Norman, Seve Ballesteros, Tom Kite, even Tom Watson. And, yet, the magnitude of the moment still seems as fresh as the trees that line Magnolia Lane.</p>
<p>“You just had roar after roar after roar,” said Price, who shot a course-record 63 on Saturday to get into a final-round pairing with Norman. “I remember seeing Sandy Lyle in the locker room afterwards. I walked in there and he had played with Jack. I said, ‘What was it like?’ It was like he was speechless. He couldn’t describe it.”</p>
<p>It reached a crescendo at No. 16, the par-3, when Nicklaus hit a 5-iron so crisp, so perfect, he bent down to pick up his tee before his ball even landed 3 feet from the cup, narrowly missing a hole-in-one.</p>
<p>“Be the right club,” his son, Jackie, said, watching the ball descend.</p>
<p>“It is,” dad said, not even flinching.</p>
<p>From the deepest corner of the valley, a thunderous roar climbed the hills and shook the earth when Nicklaus made the birdie putt. Urban legend likes to say the noise so unnerved Ballesteros, who was playing a hole behind with a three-shot lead, he chunked a 4-iron from the 15th fairway into the water. Reality is, Nicklaus had already hit his tee shot at No. 17 when Ballesteros watered his approach.</p>
<p>Jim Nantz, who was broadcasting the Masters for the first time, was in the 16th tower that day.</p>
<p>“There’s an energy down in that hollow at 16,” Nantz said. “I was talking to Phil Mickelson about it. He talked about the noise in 2004 when he holed that birdie putt at 16. He said that was the loudest noise he ever heard anywhere on a golf course. He felt like the ground was shaking. When Jack made birdie at 16 in ’86, it was an outer-body experience for me.”</p>
<p>What Nicklaus did that day, in the 50th edition of the Masters, remains the most riveting event in golf history. It came six years after his 17th major title and at an age that seemed much older than it does now. “In that day, winning at 46 was unheard of,” Strange said. Even Nicklaus conceded, “It came during a period when no one thought I could win. And I’m not sure I thought I could win.”</p>
<p>If the 84th Masters had started, as scheduled, on Thursday, Nicklaus and Gary Player would have been on the first tee in the early morning, serving as the ceremonial starters. It would have been the 11th consecutive year Nicklaus had hit the opening tee shot, going back to when he first performed the role with Arnold Palmer in 2010. There wouldn’t have been a person around the first tee who didn’t remember what they were doing that sunny April afternoon 34 years ago.</p>
<p>“I don’t care where I go, I always run into somebody and they say, ‘You know, I was in an airport in ’86,’ or ‘I canceled my airplane and sat there and watched it because I couldn’t leave,’ or ‘I had to do this’ or ‘I had to do that,’ or ‘I had to stop this’ or ‘I had to stop that,’” Nicklaus said years later. “Amazing the number of people that just told me those kind of stories.”</p>
<p>It was amazing. And nobody has forgotten.</p>
