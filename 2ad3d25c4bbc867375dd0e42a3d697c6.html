<p>While theater companies worldwide are considering their next move, Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company has been on the move, literally.</p>
<p>Mark Clayton Southers’ 17-year-old company has taken up residence in its third Downtown venue, the five-story building at 819 Penn Ave. that was the home of Future Tenant and hard by the parking garage that came down at Ninth Street and Penn.</p>

<p>The new space has inspired Pittsburgh Playwrights to project a plan for 2020-21: a hybrid season, in person and online. It would comprise live performances, with social-distance practices for the audience and artists, spread over two weeks. There would be no more than 25 audience members at one time, and the show would be recorded for digital video.</p>
<p>Subscribers will receive a code for online viewing.Scheduled are four new plays -- by Lissa Brennan, Vie Bohoem and Vanessa German, and a small-cast show, “Cyril,” with Cyril Wecht — by Southers, plus a return virtual run of Kim El’s “Ubuntu Holiday.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre was founded in 2003 as the resident company of Garfield’s Penn Theater, and it moved in 2005 to a 75-seat space at 542 Penn Ave. — accessed up a flight of stairs and through a single door within the Sixth and Penn parking garage.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust came along in 2011 with the offer of a third-floor space, accessible by elevator and wheelchair, at 937 Liberty Ave.</p>
<p>That space, however, had no third-floor bathroom and was overdo for renovations. Pittsburgh Playwrights moved out to make way for construction.</p>
<p>“We had our lighting on, but everything else was gone. We took everything out; the seating, the risers, everything. There's nothing in the space at all,” Mr. Southers said.</p>
<p>“A whole year and a half went by,” but PPTCO stayed busy, including the ambitious on-site production of “Gem of the Ocean” on a Wylie Avenue slope — the site of what was lot No. 1839 in the Hill District.</p>
<p>PPTCO was on taking its second run through August Wilson’s Pittsburgh-set American Century Cycle when COVID-19 shut down live indoor performances.</p>
<p>The company has been storing assets in five different locations in the Hill District, including the company's office space near Southers’ home and the former Pizza Parma on the corner of 9th and Penn Avenue, which is how the new site came into play.</p>
<p>“That's where they filmed Mister Rogers,” Mr. Southers said, explaining that upper floors of 819 Penn were transformed for the Tom Hanks movie, “It’s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.</p>
<p>“They rebuilt the whole area and made an apartment to look like his house.”</p>
<p>As company members and volunteers began moving chairs and props again, Mr. Southers decided, "This ain't a bad little space."</p>
<p>It is smaller than the Liberty Avenue space, “but what I like about it, it has a storefront and it has high ceilings,” Mr. Southers said. “And the [Trust real estate consultant] Brooks Robinson said, ‘Mark, if you want to use this space, you can.’ ”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Playwrights did not have to cut short an in-progress production when March 13 came along, and COVID-19 forced an abrupt end to gatherings of any kind. Pivoting quickly, the company began recitals by local and national actors of Mr.&nbsp;<a href="/A%20celebrity-packed%20online%20birthday%20celebration%20for%20August%20Wilson,%20filled%20with%20stories%20by%20those%20who%20knew%20him%20best,%20was%20a%20boon%20for%20fans%20of%20the%20late,%20great%20Pittsburgh%20playwright." target="_blank">Southers&nbsp;“Ninety-Nine Chronicles,” </a>his writings about the painful recovery from a catastrophic car crash in 2015. The company also has been collecting donations to help support its out-of-work team of onstage and behind-the-scenes artists.</p>

<p>A celebrity-packed online birthday celebration for August Wilson, filled with stories by those who knew him best, was a boon for fans of the late, great Pittsburgh playwright.</p>
<p>Now it is time to look ahead.&nbsp;If there is any chance of doing in-person theater, he believes he can fit up to 25 people in the new space, with social distancing.&nbsp;His hope is for a short run of a new show and filming it for an online audience. Among the potential roadblocks is the Actors’ Equity union, which, citing current COVID-19 concerns, is not allowing its actors to work.&nbsp;The PPTCO leader also is collaborating on an on-site piece with Cyril Wecht, the former Pittsburgh coroner who has consulted on some of the most famous trials of the modern era.</p>
<p>With so much uncertainty about in-person theater, Mr. Southers is grateful that Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre has a new place to call home.</p>
