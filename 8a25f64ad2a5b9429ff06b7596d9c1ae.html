<p>When Clayton, the restored Frick family mansion, opened to visitors in 1990, its staff tracked tour groups in a handwritten datebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That changed in 1994 when Sarah Hall began working in visitor services. The Edgewood resident set up a computer to arrange tours of the Point Breeze house and outbuildings for school groups and senior citizens.</p>
<p>“I did that for the first 15 months,” she recalled. “I worked really closely with the education department,&nbsp; growing and creating all sorts of new programs.”</p>
<p>Since then, Ms. Hall has held nine increasingly challenging jobs at <a href="https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/" target="_blank">The Frick Pittsburgh art museum</a>, installing 85 exhibitions. At the end of June, she is leaving to become director of the <a href="http://wcmfa.org/" target="_blank">Washington County Museum of Fine Arts</a> in Hagerstown, Md.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“It seemed like the perfect museum for me to go to.” Like the Frick, it’s “a jewel box of a museum,” Ms. Hall said.</p>
<p>Set in a city park across from a lake, the Washington County Museum was founded by William Henry Singer Jr., a native of Pittsburgh’s North Side and heir to a steel fortune. He studied art at the Academie Julian in Paris and enjoyed painting landscapes outdoors there as well as in Holland and Norway. Mr. Singer married Anna Brugh, a Hagerstown native, and they founded the museum in 1931.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Hall’s interest in museums began when she was a child. Her late father, Fred T. Hall, directed the Buffalo (N.Y) Museum of Science for 19 years. He also was a gifted artist and scientific illustrator with a basement studio at his home.</p>
<p>“I remember thinking the triceratops was named for me.... Art was all around me as well as nature and science,” she said.</p>
<p>Since 2017, Ms. Hall has been chief curator and director of collections at The Frick museum, which is adjacent to Clayton. Over the past decade, she has served on the museum’s executive leadership team and participated in its $15 million capital campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each year, about 125,000 people visit the 5.5-acre Gilded Age compound. Besides the Frick family home, visitors can tour the art museum, a car and carriage museum, a greenhouse, a gift shop and a cafe with outdoor seating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two of Ms. Hall’s most popular shows were “Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe” in 2016 and “Van Gogh, Monet, Degas: The Mellon Collection of French Art from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts”&nbsp; in 2018. Her annual curatorial budget is about $850,000 and she supervises five people.</p>
<p>Ms. Hall also oversaw the Frick family’s collections of early Renaissance panel paintings, 18th-century French fine and decorative art and 19th-century European paintings and decorative arts.&nbsp;Last year, with her guidance, the museum received nearly $1 million in grants.</p>
<p>In 2007, Ms. Hall took over the curatorial department, caring for collections and installing exhibitions. Seven years later, a 3,000-square-foot visitors center opened. Its&nbsp;large glass walls allow visitors to easily identify buildings in the complex and it offers a comfortable learning lounge with books, chairs and sofas. Visitors can touch a view screen to see images of artwork, clothes and cars that belonged to Henry Clay Frick and his family.</p>
<p>Over the years, Ms. Hall has painted and repainted the Belgian linen fabric on the museum’s walls to highlight each exhibition, including “Fashioning Art From Paper,” which showcased the eye-popping, three-dimensional designs of a Belgian fashion designer.</p>
<p>“Isabelle de Borchgrave was kind of about color and how color affects your mood. It helps to activate your imagination,” Ms. Hall said.</p>
<p>Construction of collection storage facilities made her work easier, she said. Previously, “we had had off-site storage that was an hour away. Changing a gown at Clayton was a day’s work.”</p>
<p>Moving the <a href="https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/carandcarriagemuseum" target="_blank">Car and Carriage Museum</a> from a dark garage into a new, sparkling white building made the Frick’s vehicle collection come alive. In 2018, curator Kim Cady mounted “Driving the Disenfranchised,” an exhibition about the influence of automobiles on American women’s campaign to win the right to vote.</p>
<p>Ms. Hall’s first show, “Medieval Art in America,” featured jewel-encrusted reliquaries and incredibly detailed ivories.</p>
<p>“I was really nervous about the fragility of things. I’d read all sorts of books on art handling,” she recalled.</p>
<p>“I loved the Islamic show ‘Empire of the Sultans.’ It was really immersive and gorgeous.”</p>
<p>One of her favorites was a 2015 show, “Forbidden Fruit: Chris Antemann at Meissen.”</p>
<p>Ms. Hall enjoys seeing museum staff react to the opening of an exhibition.&nbsp;“When they finally walk in and see the show, they get tears in their eyes. This thing they’ve been living with so long has finally been manifested.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the Maryland museum, Ms. Hall will have a staff of eight full-time and 10 part-time employees. Led by Rebecca Massie Lane for the past 12 years, the museum obtained major grants to reinstall permanent galleries, endowed an education position and set an ambitious exhibition schedule, Ms. Hall said.</p>
<p>Raising the museum’s profile will be a large part of Ms. Hall’s duties when she starts on July 20.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason why everyone in Pittsburgh shouldn’t know it. It’s closer to Baltimore and Washington, D.C.,” she said.</p>
