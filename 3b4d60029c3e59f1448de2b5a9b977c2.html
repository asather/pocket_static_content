<h1>Teachers at Baldwin Township charter school plan labor protest at board meeting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Teachers from the Young Scholars of Western Pennsylvania Charter School in Baldwin Township plan to picket Thursday outside a school board meeting for what they said was a&nbsp;“lack of progress” over 18 months of contract negotiations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group of about 40 teachers represented by the Pennsylvania State Education Association said they will start to protest at 5:30 p.m. ahead of a scheduled 6 p.m. board meeting being held at the school.</p>
<p>“The school is not negotiating in good faith and has continually stonewalled the process by&nbsp;refusing to agree to many of the most basic contractual items,” Matt Edgell, PSEA region advocacy coordinator, said in a statement. “Another&nbsp;issue that appears to be prolonging the negotiations is the fact that none of the school’s&nbsp;representatives at the bargaining table have any involvement in the day to day operations of the&nbsp;school. They don’t know what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Teachers, as well as parents of students enrolled at the school, also plan to speak to board members at the meeting.</p>
<p>“We value our teachers and staff as we value our students and their families,” the board said in a statement. “We are currently in negotiations, so we will respect that process by communicating directly at the negotiating table.”</p>
<p>The Young Scholars of Western Pennsylvania Charter School is located at 600 Newport Drive and has an enrollment of 330 students, according to its website.</p>
