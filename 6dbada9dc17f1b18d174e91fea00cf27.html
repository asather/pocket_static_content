<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> Do you&nbsp;see the Steelers and Ravens as two franchises going in opposite directions? The Steelers, coming off of back-to-back 8-8 seasons, somehow manage to have only 6 picks in the entire draft and no cap room to sign FA. The Ravens coming off of back-to-back North championships somehow manage to have 6 picks in the first 3 rounds, 10 total picks and cap room to sign impact FAs</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I am going to answer the question like this: Yes, I think the Ravens have passed the Steelers and have increased their lead in this offseason so far. But there is a reason for that: One team has an aging star QB who is eating up like $35 million of cap space and the other team has a young QB on a rookie contract. That is a huge difference and one that is very difficult to overcome. The Steelers’ window for winning at a high level is also smaller because of this fact. The Ravens, however, at some point in the next few years will have to pull out the checkbook and pay Lamar Jackson $30-$40 million a year and that will change everything. Also, the Steelers did only have six picks but they traded one last year and got Minkah Fitzpatrick. The Ravens aren’t the Steelers’ biggest problem right now, though. Their problem is the Browns, who I think will take a big step forward this season, and the Bengals, who just drafted a franchise quarterback.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Edmund:&nbsp;</strong>If the Steelers are 3-1, 4 games into the season, and Ben goes down possibly for the rest of the year, do the Steelers stick with Rudolph or sign a journeyman QB to finish out the season? I’m wondering if the Steelers are looking like a playoff team at that point would they rely on Rudolph to take them to the playoffs and maybe beyond? Signing a journeyman QB could also create some friction in Ben’s final contract year if he is able to return.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Define journeyman quarterback. At that point — four games into the season — who the heck is going to be available for them to go get who can play even a little bit? I’ll tell you who: the next Paxton Lynch. They needed a quarterback when Roethlisberger went down and scoured the market and that is who they found. And he wasn’t able to get a sniff of playing time despite the fact that the two guys ahead of him weren’t exactly lighting the world on fire. For better or worse, the Steelers are hitching their wagon to Mason Rudolph as the backup quarterback.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Joey:&nbsp;</strong>If it were indeed true, would you have traded JuJu Smith-Schuster for the 49ers’ 1st round pick, No. 31 overall in this year's NFL draft?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> No. They need receivers. Why trade your best receiver, Smith-Schuster, to move up 18 spots in a draft loaded with receivers? That would have made absolutely no sense. It would have been a bad trade. If anything, given who they drafted, they should have traded back about five or six spots, got another late round pick, and they still could have picked Chase Claypool. Smith-Schuster didn’t have a good year last year but he is still their best receiver. They need him to have a big, bounce-back&nbsp; season this year.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis:</strong> Did the Steelers make a mistake by not drafting a&nbsp;left inside linebacker to complement Devin Bush?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I wish they would have addressed inside linebacker but they went outside linebacker (Alex Highsmith) instead. I don’t hate the pick, though, because they also needed someone to back up (and possibly replace) Bud Dupree. I just think they are on thin ice in the middle since they cut Mark Barron and Tyler Matakavich went elsewhere. They likely will address this somehow in the next two months, maybe just by signing an inexpensive veteran who is still on the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> Why do you think the Steelers passed on the chance to draft Jalen Hurts, Jacob Eason or Jake Fromm?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Sigh. This really can’t be this hard, can it? This discussion has been fatiguing at times but I will give it my best shot one more time. The Steelers made it clear that they are sticking with Mason Rudolph as their backup quarterback. They made it clear they still believe he can be their quarterback of the future. They also are in&nbsp;“win now” mode, which means they needed to pick players who can play right now and help them win right now. I actually thought they might grab Fromm if he had slid to 198, but he didn’t quite make it that far. I have no issues at all with how the Steelers have handled the quarterback situation this offseason other than this: if Jameis Winston indeed signed for $1.1 million, they should have made a pitch to sign him. He is a player who could have improved their team (backup quarterback spot) without eating up a lot of cap space.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:&nbsp;</strong>Who did you think got the steal of the entire NFL draft?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I would say there were four of them: Falcons third-round (78th overall) center Matt Hennessey, Vikings’ fifth-round (169th overall) defensive back Harrison Hand, Eagles’ sixth-round (196th overall) defensive back Shaun Bradley and Tampa Bay’s seventh-round (241st overall) linebacker Chapelle Russell. All four of them are extremely undervalued and will be excellent NFL players. I do also love the Ravens’ last pick in the seventh round, safety Geno Stone from Iowa. I think he has a chance to become a starter for them some day. He is smart, tough, really understands the game of football and has great instincts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Art:</strong> Why do you think the Steelers strayed from their tradition of drafting players from successful Power Five programs? Of six picks, no one from SEC! Three from losing Big Ten programs and two from non-Power Five schools. And ND kid is from freaking Canada, eh?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I actually was going to argue with you that this isn’t correct, but the more I looked at their recent drafts there is something to it. They have traditionally picked a lot of players from successful Power Five schools like Michigan, Michigan State, Alabama, Oklahoma State, Penn State, Louisville, Virginia Tech, etc. That is an interesting observation, but I wouldn’t make too much of it. There are good players on bad teams, too. Maryland is awful but I do think the two Terps they picked have a chance to be good NFL players.</p>
<p><strong>Steve:&nbsp;</strong>Will Deon Cain be on the roster this season again? He was a promising rookie with the Colts before he got injured. Do you think he can ever be an offensive weapon? Seems like he may be on his last chance</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> He is still on the roster. He will have to make the team but he has a foot in the door and that’s all he can ask for.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> Which of the baseball plans do you think has the best chance of happening? At this point I am tired of hearing about all these different plans and just want baseball.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise: I</strong> like the current plan the best: three 10-team divisions, all teams play in their division only but get to play in their home stadiums without fans. That seems like something that can work, but again, it is all up to the health department and the medical experts. There are a lot of things that need to get worked out on that front. But my feeling is this: If they can do the three-state plan, they might as well work a little harder and do the three regional divisions so players can stay at their home with their families. I doubt we will see fans in the stands until August, if at all, but I do think we will see baseball.</p>
<p><strong>Gary:</strong> Have you watched the Last Dance documentary and what are your thoughts about it? I like it for the most part but it is a story told too much from Michael Jordan’s point of view, that much is clear.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I love it. I absolutely love all the behind the scenes and inside look at that team. The only thing I wish it had is Jerry Krause alive and able to defend himself or give his take more. I think he is being made the villain, and while he absolutely blew that team up, I would like to hear more of why he did the things he did. I also think that Scottie Pippen has come off looking bad for the most part, like a bit of a whiner. We are also hearing way too much from Steve Kerr because he was an afterthought on those teams. And yes, it is a lot from Jordan’s perspective but, well, he is Jordan, so it probably should be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
