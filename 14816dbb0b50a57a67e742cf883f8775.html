<h1>Coroner says inability to test the dead for COVID-19 puts lives at risk</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Someone died, and Tim Warco couldn’t provide anyone the answers they wanted.</p>
<p>Mr. Warco, the Washington County coroner, was called to the scene of a death in mid-March. First responders had learned the decedent may have had COVID-19, but Mr. Warco couldn’t confirm those fears because he had no means of testing the body.</p>
<p>The episode exemplifies how coroners are being left out of the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Warco said.</p>
<p>The Washington County coroner, a regional vice president for the Pennsylvania Coroner’s Association, said many coroners aren’t able to test people who died at home and may have had COVID-19.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"><img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>That not only leads to potential discrepancies in the state’s count of confirmed COVID-19 deaths, Mr. Warco said, but also could put first responders and decedents’ family members at risk.</p>
<p>“It’s my responsibility when somebody dies at home to ascertain the cause and manner of death,” Mr. Warco said. “When there’s a death, who do they call? They call the coroner.”</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health has begun to “push” personal protection equipment and test kits out to counties, department spokesman Nate Wardle wrote in an email.</p>
<p>Some counties have received those kits. In Chester County, the coroner received 20 kits from the state’s lab last week</p>
<p>“We are very fortunate, as I understand,” Chester County coroner Christina VandePol said.</p>
<p>Most coroners in the state don’t have access to testing, coroner’s association president Charles E. Kiessling said.</p>
<p>“The kits seem to be few and far between,” Mr. Kiessling, the Lycoming County coroner, said Sunday. “I ordered six kits and received two.”</p>
<p>As of Sunday, Washington County didn’t receive any tests, public safety director Jeff Yates said. His office’s push kit only included PPE and “nothing else.”</p>
<p>The state has pushed out COVID-19 tests “to coroners who need them,” Mr. Wardle said. “Coroners in need of tests should work through their normal channels to request them from the Department of Health.”</p>
<p>“Though we’ve made several requests through the channels the Department of Health has outlined,” Mr. Warco wrote in a letter expressing his concerns, “I have yet to receive a single test kit.”</p>
<p>When Washington County officials recently tried to contact the Department of Health’s help line to request equipment, they were on hold for an hour before they decided to hang up.</p>
<p>Requesting kits from private testing services also has proven unsuccessful for the county.</p>
<p>Coroners in the region have complained that this inability to test suspected COVID-19 deaths has led to a discrepancy in the state’s death count.</p>
<p>“If they want an accurate number of how many deaths have occurred, then [coroners] have to have a means of testing,” Mr. Warco said.</p>
<p>The state said deaths involving suspected or confirmed cases of the new coronavirus don’t need to be referred to the coroner because a death can be reported by any medical professional.</p>
<p>“Deaths are referred to a coroner if a death case occurs when a medical professional is not able to certify the death, or if the circumstances surrounding the death suggest the death was sudden, violent, suspicious in nature or was the result of other-than-natural causes,” Mr. Wardle said.</p>
<p>The Department of Health says deaths due to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 are natural deaths, and don’t need to be assessed by a coroner.</p>
<p>“That’s bunk for the Department of Health to tell us that,” Mr. Warco said. “We’ve been in touch” with secretary of health Dr. Rachel Levine, “and they’re just giving us the runaround.”</p>
<p>The Washington coroner argues he and other coroners are obligated by state law to conduct an autopsy in cases of “death known or suspected to be due to contagious disease and constituting a public hazard.”</p>
<p>The state is circumventing coroners’ jurisdiction in these cases, Mr. Warco said.</p>
<p>“[Coroners are] all experiencing the same issue, and the issue is with the Department of Health,” Mr. Warco said.</p>
<p>The state’s interim guidance to coroners from the state health department, dated April 7, notes that COVID-19 is classified as an infectious disease and is “primarily spread through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.”</p>
<p>“This type of spread is not a concern after death,” the documents read.</p>
<p>The state’s guidance states medical examiners and coroners do not need to test for COVID-19 if the diagnosis was already confirmed before a person’s death.</p>
<p>Coroners may decide to test decedents based on if the person had been exhibiting symptoms of the new coronavirus, if there had been infections in that “jurisdiction” or if the decedent had been in contact with someone with a known COVID-19 diagnosis.</p>
<p>If a decedent meets those criteria, the Department of Health prioritizes testing for those who “may have potentially exposed many people while they were infectious.”</p>
<p>That list of prioritized people includes health care workers, first responders or someone who “resided in a congregate care setting.”</p>
<p>People who had COVID-19 symptoms and were hospitalized or saw a health care provider, but didn’t receive a positive test, are also included as a priority.</p>
<p>Mr. Warco’s concern is that his inability to test decedents in their homes puts their family members and first responders at risk.</p>
<p>Those concerns are deep in counties like Washington, where there is no health department. “People have nowhere to turn,” Mr. Warco said.</p>
