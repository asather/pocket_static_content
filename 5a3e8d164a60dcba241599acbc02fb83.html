<h1>Port Authority, other area transit agencies struggling due to low ridership, high costs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The COVID-19 requirements for staying at home and social distancing are quickly creating severe financial problems for transit agencies, which face the triple-whammy of having to maintain some level of service, drastically low ridership and increased costs for sanitizing vehicles and facilities.</p>
<p>The severe decrease in ridership — ranging from 35% to 90% across the country, according to the&nbsp;American Public Transportation Association — is creating such gaping holes in budgets at some transit agencies that each version of the congressional stimulus bill under discussion would include $20 billion for transit agencies. Port Authority will cut service by 25% Wednesday and agencies in Butler and Washington counties are making substantial cuts in service while trying to make sure essential workers like nurses and police officers can get to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What is common is that everybody is seeing drastic reductions in ridership regardless of the size of their agency,” said Paul Skoutelas, president and CEO of the APTA and former CEO at Port Authority of Allegheny County.</p>
<p>“That’s why we’re pushing so hard for that stimulus package. Otherwise, the transit system is going to see dire consequences.”</p>
<p>Port Authority’s numbers are stark: The system’s average of daily rides for the first week of March — before the virus restrictions —&nbsp; was 207,180, up about 1% from 2019. Last week, with restrictions in place, the average of daily rides fell to 82,118, a decrease of about 60%.</p>
<p>In the full third week of March 2019, the system provided 1,043,000 rides compared to 410,000 this year. The largest drop was on the light rail system, which saw&nbsp; the number of rides drop from 125,000 to 30,000 year to year.</p>
<p>“Obviously, those numbers are significant and unprecedented,” said authority spokesman Adam Brandolph. “For the slide to be that drastic is something we’ve never really seen before.”</p>
<p>The reduction in ridership comes at a time when agencies are spending extra money to operate safely. Port Authority, for example, is sanitizing all vehicles and transit shelters daily right now, often using workers on overtime, when the normal practice is daily cleaning but sanitizing once a month.</p>
<p>Advertising revenue for buses and stations also has been down substantially since the middle of February. Additionally, the agency likely will cancel plans to refinance about $160 million in bonds at an estimated savings of $2 million a year because the virus has caused the bond market to crash.</p>
<p>“We’re at least triple our normal orders of bleach, disinfectant and cleaning products,” Mr. Brandolph said. “We’ve been spending tens of thousands of dollars a day more for now going on more than two weeks. It’s very difficult.</p>
<p>“We certainly understand that public transit isn’t the only or the most important industry to be impacted greatly by this situation. At the same time, we can’t overlook the fact that we’ve been impacted greatly.”</p>
<p>Port Authority is reducing service by 25% beginning Wednesday, maintaining some service on all routes and keeping the first and last trips on every route. Most of the cuts will be to rush-hour service, which has had the biggest loss of ridership.</p>

<p>Port Authority CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman, who worked at three other agencies before coming to Pittsburgh in January 2018, said her agency is not in dire circumstances yet because it has about $140 million in reserves and has guaranteed funding through the state Department of Transportation. But other agencies across the country that are funded through sales taxes face an uncertain future because the virus emergency has caused serious problems for the national economy.</p>
<p>Laura Wiens, executive director&nbsp; of Pittsburghers for Public Transit, is among those lobbying for federal help for agencies.</p>
<p>“We understand this situation requires some reduction in service,” she said. “We want federal officials to realize that COVID-19 shows that public transit is an essential extension to healthcare because it is the only way some people have to get to medical care and grocery stores.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t allow the system to take a substantial financial hit because of this.”</p>
<p>In Butler County, the transit authority on Monday reduced its normal fixed-route system to the level of service provided on Saturdays because ridership has “decreased tremendously,” said John Paul, executive director of the Butler Transit Authority.</p>
<p>To protect riders and drivers, the agency has eliminated fares and is requiring riders to enter and exit through the middle door unless they have special needs, Mr. Paul said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Round trips to Pittsburgh have been cut to twice a day only along the Route 8 corridor when it previously ran three round trips each on Route 8 and Route 68. It initially cut to one trip on Route 68 but eliminated that when it had no riders on Monday.</p>
<p>The agency is keeping track of its extra cost for cleaning vehicles and lost ridership revenue in case it can get reimbursement.</p>
<p>In Washington County, executive director Sheila Gombita of the authority that operates as Freedom Transit said ridership is down about 60%. On Monday, the agency reduced local service and cut trips to Pittsburgh from 10 round trips to three.</p>
<p>“We really don’t know what the whole financial impact will be yet,” Ms. Gombita said. “Revenue from ridership is where we expect to take the biggest hit.”</p>
<p>Westmoreland Transit officials couldn’t be reached for comment on changes there.</p>
<p>Alexis Campbell, spokeswoman for PennDOT, said the agency is monitoring transit agencies across the state.</p>
<p>“We will continue to offer guidance to these agencies as they navigate schedule and service changes,” she said.&nbsp;“We will update our transit partners on funding information as it becomes available. PennDOT does support the request for increased funding on the federal level.”&nbsp;</p>
