<h1>Cold weather, winter school breaks bump up region's December unemployment to 4.5%</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Winter break at schools and universities and cold weather that slowed construction combined to push up the December unemployment rate in the seven-county Pittsburgh area by two-tenths of a percentage point to 4.5%, according to the state Department of Labor &amp; Industry.</p>
<p>In the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area, Allegheny County had the lowest unemployment rate at 4.5% while Fayette County had the highest rate at 6.9%. Among the counties in the region, only Allegheny did not see an increase in the unemployment rate from November.</p>
<p>The biggest declines from November in the number of jobs were in the education and health services sector, down less than 1% or 1,800, and construction, down 2.6% or 1,600, which helped nudge up the regionâ€™s jobless rate. But December was also the height of the shopping and shipping season, which accounted for a 2,300 job increase to 216,200 in the sector. However, the figures were not seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p>The total number of seasonally adjusted nonfarm jobs in the seven-county region rose by 2,800 or 0.24% to 1.19 million from November, according to the report, but was unchanged over the year, while the number of jobs statewide bumped up by 0.5%. Unemployment rates statewide ranged between 3.3% in Centre County to 8.1% in Cameron County.</p>
