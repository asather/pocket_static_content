<h1>How a 20-year friendship with a civil rights icon led David Hickton to oversee trillions in Washington spending</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — In late April, as the COVID-19 pandemic bore down on the country, David Hickton, the former U.S. attorney and University of Pittsburgh cyber-policy expert, heard from an old friend about a job opportunity with a seemingly unenviable mission: to track $2.8 trillion in economic relief funding just approved by Congress.</p>
<p>That friend, Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., asked Mr. Hickton to help him assemble an oversight panel led by Democrats in Washington that would operate on a limited budget,&nbsp;hunt down information from uncooperative federal agencies, and&nbsp;conduct nonpartisan investigations during a polarized election season. Oh, and wrap it up by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>Mr. Hickton’s response? He was in Washington the next week and moving into an office next door to Mr. Clyburn with a view of the National Mall.</p>
<p>“The only thing I knew when I started was: We had an historic pandemic, we had an historic outlay of funds by Congress, and we had to move quickly,” recalled Mr. Hickton, who had no prior experience on Capitol Hill, in an interview this month.</p>
<p>This summer, the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis has moved briskly with Mr. Hickton serving as staff director and senior counsel.&nbsp;It has held 12 hearings and five briefings, pursued 17 active investigations, and reviewed thousands of documents on its way to exposing what it calls some of the&nbsp;most widespread issues with the Trump administration’s distribution of relief funds.</p>
<p>With a budget of $2 million and a staff of fewer than 20 people, the subcommittee has shown how small business loans fell into the wrong hands, uncovered problematic federal contracts, and released White House documents that contradicted President Donald Trump’s downplaying of COVID-19 from June through August.</p>
<p>Mr. Clyburn, who with 27 years in Congress serves as House Majority Whip, said in an interview Friday that his goal is to ensure public funds were spent in an “effective, efficient and equitable way” and to save American lives.</p>
<p>The Republican members, meanwhile, complain they have been sidelined by Democrats whose only goal is to vilify well-intentioned federal programs that have been largely successful in attempts&nbsp;to make Mr. Trump look bad.</p>
<p>“Democrats’ oversight efforts have involved little more than partisan witch hunts to blame and shame small businesses who are struggling, as well as trying to undermine the credibility of great American drug companies who are working overtime to find a vaccine,” Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the top Republican on the subcommittee and House Minority Whip, said in a statement in response to questions.</p>
<p><strong>A long friendship</strong></p>
<p>As the economy shut down to stem the spread of COVID-19,&nbsp;Congress unanimously approved the biggest economic relief package in history.</p>
<p>On March 27, Mr. Trump signed into law the&nbsp;Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, a package of $2.3 trillion in new federal spending to be distributed as quickly as possible to struggling Americans. Three weeks later, Congress approved another $500 billion — and, with it, the House voted to establish a separate panel under&nbsp;the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.</p>
<p>The panel was modeled, House Democrats said at the time, on a WWII-era&nbsp;Senate oversight panel led by Sen. Harry S. Truman that&nbsp;rooted out waste and inefficiencies in American military contracts. Mr. Clyburn — a Truman expert who keeps copies of the former president’s biography with him in both South Carolina and Washington — compared the nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic to a war footing.</p>
<p>Mr. Clyburn was looking for a professional who had the right experience and temperament, and Mr. Hickton came to mind.</p>
<p>The two had been close friends since meeting about 20 years ago through a mutual acquaintance. Mr. Hickton, who considers himself a civil rights history buff, admired Mr. Clyburn’s long commitment to social justice, which includes a 60-year friendship with late Rep. John Lewis.</p>
<p>The two men became golfing buddies as Mr. Hickton’s family vacationed over the years&nbsp;in South Carolina, where&nbsp;Mr. Clyburn sized up the lawyer and law professor. You can tell a lot about a person,&nbsp;Mr. Clyburn said in the interview, by observing them during a round of golf: how they approach problems, how they manage stress, whether they take risks.</p>
<p>“I was impressed with him,” Mr. Clyburn said.</p>
<p>The men kept in touch as Mr. Clyburn watched Mr. Hickton climb the ranks. In 2010, Mr. Hickton was named the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania — with no prior experience working in the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
<p>Over six years in that role, Mr. Hickton made headlines in Pittsburgh for high-profile moves, which included a first-of-its-kind indictment against the Chinese People’s Liberation Army for economic espionage against Pittsburgh-area companies and organizations.&nbsp;Mr. Hickton also co-chaired the National Heroin Task Force and formed a working group of U.S. attorneys on how to combat drug overdoses and addiction.</p>
<p>When Mr. Clyburn’s book, “Blessed Experiences: Genuinely Southern, Proudly Black,” hit the shelves in 2014, Mr. Hickton scooped up some 50 copies for his staff at the U.S. Attorney’s office.&nbsp;Mr. Hickton brought in Mr. Clyburn to speak to civil rights organizers in Pittsburgh and he traveled to South Carolina with his family to participate in Mr. Clyburn’s annual charity golf tournament.</p>
<p>After stepping down as U.S. attorney in 2017, Mr. Hickton returned to the University of Pittsburgh, where he earned his law degree in 1981. He served as founding director for the school’s Institute for Cyber Law, Policy and Security. Mr. Clyburn said he turned on the television one day and Mr. Hickton was speaking as a featured expert on cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Days after the subcommittee was created in April, Mr. Clyburn broached the job opportunity with Mr. Hickton. Given his experience tackling big problems and his bit of an outsider perspective,&nbsp;“it was just a perfect match,” Mr. Clyburn said.</p>
<p>Still,&nbsp;Mr. Clyburn was a bit surprised Mr. Hickton accepted his offer.&nbsp;“Once you’ve been the U.S. attorney, sometimes you go off and decide to retire,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Fast and furious</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Hickton said he leaned on his experiences in Pittsburgh to set up an investigative framework in the nation’s capital. He described the cybersecurity institute and oversight panel as similarly&nbsp;“geometric” challenges.</p>
<p>“We had to confront multiple problems at the same time,” Mr. Hickton said.</p>
<p>Mr. Hickton said he received a “tremendous” number of resumes and hired people as quickly as possible. He methodically funneled oversight work into three lanes: public health, which included nursing homes, COVID-19 testing and treatments; economic supports, which covered federal relief programs like PPP; and economic impacts, which analyzed the effects of the virus on education and voting rights.</p>
<p>Each of the three teams has a team leader and three or four staff members, he said. Every day at 9 a.m., he holds a strategy meeting with three of his top advisers to discuss progress. They mapped out the calendar, circling Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day holidays as markers to push them to meet deadlines.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Hickton largely works from his Washington office, meetings have been relegated to Zoom, WebEx and phone calls, complicating an already difficult task.</p>
<p>“What we have been able to achieve is remarkable — with a staff, the vast majority of which I’ve yet to met,” Mr. Hickton said.</p>
<p>The panel’s first official action was to cite five large publicly traded firms, including a steel company near Pittsburgh, for taking small business loan money from the Paycheck Protection Program. One of the five companies, Georgia-based biopharmaceutical firm MiMedx Group, has returned the loan.</p>
<p>The panel’s first briefing, on the government’s testing and contact tracing strategy, featured leading academics and former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb.</p>
<p>The panel in recent weeks has released more PPP data, held hearings on election security and questioned the $765 million federal contract with Eastman Kodak to produce pharmaceuticals. That contract was put on hold last month amid the committee’s allegations of securities fraud and concerns the company could meet its obligations.</p>
<p>This month, it released eight weeks of White House Coronavirus Task Force reports that show presidential advisers knew the virus’&nbsp;spread over the summer was worse than Mr. Trump publicly acknowledged.</p>
<p>House Republicans have criticized the subcommittee from the start.&nbsp;While the Truman Committee was unanimously authorized by the Senate in 1941, the House voted 212 to 182, along party lines, to authorize Mr. Clyburn’s panel.</p>
<p>The top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, called it a “blatant attempt to use the coronavirus pandemic for partisan ends” and “nothing more than the speaker’s politicization of a crisis.”</p>
<p>Mr. Jordan, referring to Mr. Clyburn’s endorsement of the Democratic presidential nominee, said the House had put “Joe Biden’s key House advocate in charge of a powerful new panel that is more like an arm of the DNC than the U.S. Congress.”</p>
<p>Mr. Clyburn defended his record in Washington working with both parties on issues like anti-poverty measures and broadband expansion. “I’ve been in Congress 27 years — they know me,” Mr. Clyburn said. “They know full well, in spite of what they may say to the contrary, I would never misuse any position I’ve ever had.”</p>
<p>As the panel’s work enters a final, furious stretch, Mr. Hickton said he has operated “as nonpartisan as I could” and maintained a “good relationship” with the minority staff.&nbsp;Mr. Clyburn commanded&nbsp;“unparalleled level of respect from all corners of Washington, which is rare during these times.”<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Mr. Hickton marveled at the chance to work with someone he viewed as an icon for so long.</p>
<p>“If anything, I have an even greater respect and deeper appreciation for him now,” Mr. Hickton said.</p>
