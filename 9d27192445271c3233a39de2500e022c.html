<p>LAUSANNE, Switzerland — A female skater was severely injured after falling to the ice from about 16 feet during a rehearsal for the opening ceremony of the Youth Winter Olympics in Lausanne, police said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old Russian woman’s life is in danger, police in the canton (state) of Vaud said. An investigation into Tuesday’s incident is being led by police in the city of Lausanne.</p>
<p>Police said the woman was being hoisted by a cable attached to the ceiling of the main hockey stadium in Lausanne. The skater suddenly lost balance and fell.</p>
<p>The inquiry must try to establish “the reasons, the circumstances and possible responsibilities in this accident,” police said.</p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee said in a statement a female performing artist was evacuated for treatment at a hospital in Lausanne, without detailing the incident.</p>
<p>“The IOC and Lausanne 2020 wish the performer a fast and full recovery,” the Olympic body said.</p>
<p>The two-week games open Thursday with a ceremony at the new arena, which will also host games at the men’s hockey world championships in May.</p>
