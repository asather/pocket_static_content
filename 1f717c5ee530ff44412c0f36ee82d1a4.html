<h1>When celebrities make a Cameo, recipients get the star treatment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For many years, “Gomer Pyle” star Jim Nabors performed “Back Home Again In Indiana” at the Indianapolis 500. This summer, Broadway’s Telly Leung memorized the lyrics so he could sing it in a video request.</p>
<p>Life can be strange, but this is the stuff of which <a href="https://www.cameo.com/" target="_blank">Cameo</a> dreams are made.</p>
<p>“[It was] to cheer someone up who was super-bummed about the Indy 500 being postponed. That was a fun one!” said the Broadway star and Carnegie Mellon University grad.</p>
<p>Cameo (<a href="http://www.cameo.com" target="_blank">www.cameo.com</a>) is a Chicago-based company that delivers personalized video messages for birthdays, retirements, bar mitzvahs, baby showers, graduations and who knows what else.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to make the most authentic fan experience in the world,” said Darius Fleming, the company’s head of sports partnerships.</p>
<p>Cameo pop-up ads are seemingly everywhere online, but the 3-year-old company hardly has to advertise. The product does that itself, when people share the short clips with friends on social media.</p>
<p>It’s a simple premise. The website features more than 40,000 profiles, from athletes to artists, professional Santas to video gamers, soap stars to Furries. There are at least two Donald J. Trump impersonators and Martha, queen of the R&amp;R Ranch for rescued miniature horses.s</p>
<p>Friends and family provide a few details about the recipient, and pay up. Some are as cheap as $7 but others&nbsp;— boxers Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, for example&nbsp;— are in the $1,000 range.</p>
<p>That’s also the approximate cost of having the venerable Dick Van Dyke wish you the best. Oh, Rob!</p>
<p>Caitlyn Jenner is currently commanding $2,500.&nbsp;Not as high-priced, but super-popular are “Cheer” star Jerry Harris ($150), whose requests topped six digits within his first month, as well as Carole Baskin ($299) of “Tiger King.”</p>
<p>There are Pittsburgh celebrities, too. It’s $50 for University of Pittsburgh basketball coach Jeff Capel wishing “Mazel Tov” to a boy on his bar mitzvah and $95 for birthday greetings from Steelers backup quarterback Mason Rudolph. Hall of Fame football players cost more:&nbsp;Dan Marino ($350), Jerome Bettis ($300) and Kevin Greene ($249). Greene’s profile jokingly states he’s up for anything, almost.</p>
<p>“I ain’t doing squat for Cowboy fans… nor Cleveland Browns fans, either,” he says in his promo.</p>
<p>Cameo receives 25 cents of every dollar, but it’s quantity, not quality, that has helped the company grow. Fleming said orders hit 1 million requests in July.</p>
<p>There is a less expensive “chat” option as well.</p>
<p>Doing a Cameo is easy and quick, and the self-taped videos have an interesting mix of backgrounds, from living rooms to parking lots.</p>
<p>“I have done Cameo messages from everywhere. That’s what I love about Cameo,” said Leung ($50), who has done about 70. “I was on vacation in Beijing last year and I actually recorded a Cameo greeting from the Great Wall of China!”</p>
<p>“I’ve recorded videos whenever and wherever,” said Pittsburgh native Chris Jamison ($30), a finalist on “The Voice.”</p>
<p>“Essentially, I’m just whipping out my phone and sending my biggest fans a video message.”</p>
<p>Requests are screened and there are limitations on content. No violence or nudity and coarse language is discouraged, but it does show up occasionally.</p>
<p>Many Cameos are short and simple, perhaps a minute. But some display a real commitment. The Phillies’ Andrew McCutchen, who has a strong Pittsburgh fan base from his years with the Pirates, makes his Cameos well worth the $150 price tag.&nbsp;In a birthday greeting to a child, he acknowledged how difficult it is to be stuck inside during the pandemic.&nbsp; The ballplayer closed with a reminder to keep smiling, because that makes others feel better as well.</p>
<p>“I’m going to sit here right now and wait ‘till you smile!” McCutchen said, pausing for a few beats before flashing a smile of his own.</p>
<p>Horror fans have reached out to Bloomfield’s Tom Savini ($100), who gives his Cameo subjects a tour of his studio.</p>
<p>“I’m your birthday present!” he says in one. “I’m going to fill your eyeballs up with some scary stuff.”</p>
<p>Savini gives value in his 164 Cameo greetings; most are between 4 and 5 minutes long.</p>
<p>Leung and the many Broadway-caliber talents often sing or play an instrument. “Modern Family” actress Julie Bowen ($175) stages little comedic mini-dramas.</p>
<p>Lest you’re wondering why an Emmy Award-winning actress would do Cameos, know that Bowen is one of many who gives her fees to charity. Her favorite is Baby2Baby, a nonprofit that provides essentials such as diapers to children living in poverty.</p>
<p>Baskin, whose fame is rising now that she’s on this season’s&nbsp;“Dancing With the Stars,” uses her platform to bring attention to BigCatAct.com, which supports a bill to benefit big cats.</p>
<p>Leung donated all of his Cameo fees in April to Broadway Cares Equity Fights Aids.</p>
<p>“I think many folks took advantage of the opportunity to get a personalized message from me while supporting an incredible charity,” he said.</p>
<p>A recent episode of HBO’s “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” cemented Cameo’s place in pop culture. Reporting that U.S. Rep.&nbsp; Louie Gohmert of Texas tested positive for COVID-19 and told his staff in person,&nbsp;Oliver wondered if there might have been a better way.</p>
<p>Up popped a Cameo by actor Steve Guttenberg pushing the importance of wearing a mask.</p>
<p>“That is the <em>best</em> $150 I have ever spent,” said a gleeful Oliver.</p>
<p>It’s what Cameo is going for, Fleming said.</p>
<p>“We want to create that&nbsp;‘wow’ moment when they receive it. Not necessarily create tears, but a moment they want to share with friends and family, that excitement.”</p>
