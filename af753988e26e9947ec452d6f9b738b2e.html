<h1>Police: Pitt researcher's slaying didn't involve his COVID-19 work</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The slaying of a University of Pittsburgh medical school COVID-19 researcher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/02/Ross-police-investigating-two-homicides-Allegheny-County/stories/202005020066" target="_blank">killed Saturday in his Ross home</a> resulted from what police Wednesday called a&nbsp;“lengthy dispute regarding an intimate partner.”</p>
<p>“We have found zero evidence that this tragic event has anything to do with employment at the University of Pittsburgh, any work being conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and the current health crisis affecting the United States and the world,” Ross police Sgt. Brian Kohlhepp said in a news release.</p>
<p>Ross police did not reveal additional details about the dispute between victim Bing Liu and his suspected killer, Hao Gu.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu, 37, a native of China, was shot multiple times and found by his wife inside their townhouse on Elm Court.</p>
<p>Police believe that Mr. Gu, 46, of Franklin Park, fatally shot Mr. Liu, then got in his car parked nearby and killed himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu, 37, had worked under Ivet Bahar, the head of Pitt’s computational and system biology department. She said he was well liked and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/04/ross-township-murder-suicide-bing-liu-police-elm-court/stories/202005040082" target="_blank">in the process of studying the infection mechanism of COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p>Police previously said the two men knew each other. But they had remained mum about a possible motive for the shooting.</p>
<p>Sgt. Kohlhepp said&nbsp;the case had been forwarded to federal authorities.</p>
<p>“Due to the fact that the individuals involved are not United States citizens and in accordance with long-standing protocol, our review has been forwarded to federal authorities,” Sgt. Kohlhepp said.</p>
<p>On the day of the shooting, which occurred around noon, Mr. Liu had the front and rear patio doors open to his townhouse because of the nice weather, police said. His wife was not home. Police believe that Mr. Gu had unobstructed access to the residence in the 200 block of Elm Court.</p>
<p>An autopsy showed that Mr. Liu was shot in the head, neck, torso and an extremity.</p>
<p>After the shooting, Mr. Gu walked to his car, which was parked about 200 yards away on Charlemagne Circle, and killed himself, police said.</p>
<p>Franklin Park police Chief Walter Healy said Wednesday that he had no record of calls for service at Mr. Gu’s home on Pinehurst Court and that his department had minimal involvement in the case, which was handled by Ross police.</p>
<p>“We just assisted them going to the [Gu] residence by making notification,” Chief Healy said.</p>
