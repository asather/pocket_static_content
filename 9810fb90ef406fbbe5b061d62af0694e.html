<h1>Judge drops case against Wilkinsburg co-defendant Robert Thomas</h1>

<p><em><strong>This story is developing and will be updated.</strong></em></p>
<p>The judge presiding over the mass Wilkinsburg shooting case on Monday granted a defense motion to dismiss charges against one of the co-defendants.</p>
<p>Robert Thomas, 31, of Homewood, was returned to the Allegheny County Jail and will not face trial for the March 9, 2016, shooting deaths of five people and an unborn child.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski granted <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/31/wilkinsburg-homicide-witness-3-shelton-thomas-petition-dismiss/stories/202001310113?cid=search" target="_blank">a defense motion made late Thursday</a> that alleged that the prosecution did not have enough evidence to proceed against Thomas.</p>
<p>In his ruling Monday, the judge noted prosecutors had attempted to use three cooperating jailhouse witnesses, but in the end they were left with none.</p>
<p>"They are treacherous waters, we know that from experience," said Judge Borkowski.</p>
<p>"The commonwealth is left with some good circumstantial evidence," regarding the other co-defendant, Cheron Shelton, 32, of Lincoln-Lemington.</p>
<p>Testimony is expected to begin Monday.</p>
<p>A gag order remains in effect for Thomas' attorney, Casey White, who hugged Shelton's counsel as he left the courtroom.</p>
<p>The dismissal comes after more than a week&nbsp;of motions, argument and accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. In Mr. White’s motion on Thursday, he cited that the district attorney’s office decided just earlier that day that it would not be calling at trial a controversial jailhouse informant who claimed to have evidence against his client. Mr. White asked that the case against Thomas be thrown out.</p>
<p>The decision by the Allegheny County District Attorney's Office to not present testimony from the person known as Witness No. 3 marked the third time that prosecutors were prepared to use a jailhouse informant only to reverse course.</p>
<p>The testimony of the unidentified informant was put in jeopardy last week when it was revealed that he had confessed to killing a 15-month-old boy in 2013 but was not charged, and that he received financial consideration and relocation help from the authorities. None of that had been disclosed until recently.</p>
<p>Defense lawyers went berserk at the revelations and accused the DA's office of deliberately holding back information that the defense could use to either help clear their clients or impeach the credibility of the witness.</p>
<p>The lawyers characterized Witness No. 3 as a crucial part of the case against Thomas.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the four defense attorneys — Mr. White and Michael Machen and Shelton's lawyers Wendy Williams and Randall McKinney — jointly filed a 26-page motion alleging prosecutorial misconduct and violations of rules that govern the turning over of evidence. They wrote that "it becomes apparent that there has been a pattern of egregious non-disclosure and burying of Witness No. 3's statements from the district attorney's office."</p>
<p>At the time, Judge Borkowski declared that the case against Shelton would proceed.&nbsp;If Shelton is convicted of first-degree murder, the prosecution will seek the death penalty.</p>
<p>A total of 12 jurors — six men and six women — and five alternates — three women and two men — will now hear the case against Shelton.&nbsp;The jury selection process took significantly longer than in a typical trial because of several complicating factors: The trial is expected to last three weeks; there are more than 100 names on the witness list; and it is a capital case.</p>
<p>The jurors are expected to hear from dozens of prosecution witnesses over the course of the trial.</p>
<p>According to investigators, the victims had gathered at Brittany Powell’s home at 1304 Franklin Ave. the evening of March 9, 2016, for a cookout to enjoy the unseasonably warm weather.</p>
<p>Detectives said Shelton and Thomas were alerted to a Facebook post that noted that Lamont Powell would be at the cookout.</p>
<p>According to police, Shelton believed that Lamont Powell had killed his best friend, Calvin Doswell, in Lincoln-Lemington in 2013.</p>
<p>At 10:54 p.m., detectives said, Shelton and Thomas approached the house from Hazel Way. Thomas was armed with a .40-caliber handgun, police said, which he fired 18 times toward the group in the backyard, sending them fleeing to the porch for cover. Then, detectives said, Shelton used an assault-style rifle and sprayed the group with 31 more bullets.</p>
<p>Siblings Jerry Michael Shelton, 35, Brittany Powell, 27, and Chanetta Powell, 25, who was eight months pregnant; and their cousins Tina Shelton, 37, and Shada Mahone, 26, were killed. Three others were wounded, including Lamont Powell.</p>
<p>Powell has been uncooperative with the prosecution and told a detective in December, “You might as well arrest me, I’m not coming.”</p>
<p>He was picked up on a material witness warrant issued by the DA’s office on Jan. 22 and is being held at the Allegheny County Jail pending his testimony.</p>
<p>The day after his arrest, Powell and Thomas were involved in an altercation at the jail. Neither man was injured.</p>
<p>The trial will operate under heightened security. There will be metal detectors set up at the entrance to the third-floor courtroom — in addition to those at the doors to the courthouse — and cellphones will be required to be stored in a locked pouch each time a spectator enters the room.</p>
