<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Motorists going eastbound/outbound on the Parkway East experienced heavy delays Sunday due to a traffic accident at the Squirrel Hill Tunnel.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s unclear how many vehicles were involved or if there are any injuries. The crash occurred on the Swissvale end of the outbound tunnel.</p>
<p>Footage from PennDOT surveillance cameras showed that, initially, both the inbound and outbound lanes of the tunnel were shut down, causing delays in both directions.</p>
<p>The crash occurred after 2 p.m. The inbound lane was reopened after 2:30 p.m. The outbound side was finally opened around 3:25 p.m.</p>
<p>At one point, outbound traffic was backed up to the Birmingham Bridge.</p>
