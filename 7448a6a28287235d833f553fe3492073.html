<h1>Penguins forward Nick Bjugstad out week-to-week with lower-body injury</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just three games after returning from a prolonged injury absence, Nick Bjugstad will once again sidelined.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-6 forward will be out week-to-week with a lower-body injury, coach Mike Sullivan said Tuesday. This is a new injury that is not related to the core muscle surgery that forced Bjugstad to miss about 16 weeks, from Nov. 15 to March 5. In total, Bjugstad has played in just 13 games this season, tallying one goal and one assist.</p>
<p>His injury issues began almost at the same time the season did. A core muscle injury flared up, forcing him to go on injured reserve Oct. 8. He returned briefly. But soon it became obvious he would need surgery, beginning a long, non-linear rehab process that endured some setbacks.</p>
<p>In his first game back, Bjugstad centered the third line and made an immediate impact when he collided with Buffalo goaltender Jonas Johansson to help Patric Hornqvist score. But after playing in back-to-back games this weekend, Bjugstad stayed home in Pittsburgh while the team traveled to New Jersey to being a three-game road trip.</p>
<p>“You love going to battle with your teammates,” Bjugstad said in the days before he returned from the core muscle surgery. “That’s been gone from me for a long time. You realize how fortunate you are when you are on the ice. It makes you very grateful to have good health and be out there playing.”</p>
<p>The last three games, Bjugstad centered the third line, playing between McCann and Hornqvist. In Bjugstad’s absence, the Penguins shuffled their bottom-six during Tuesday’s morning skate. McCann moved back to center, playing between recent acquisition Evan Rodrigues on the left wing and Hornqvist on the right wing.</p>
<p>The injury also opened the door for Sam Lafferty, who was a healthy scratch in Sunday’s game. He moved onto the fourth line, playing alongside Teddy Blueger and Brandon Tanev.</p>
