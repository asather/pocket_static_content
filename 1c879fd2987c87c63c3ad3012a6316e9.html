<h1>Sidney Crosby undergoes wrist surgery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penguins captain Sidney Crosby underwent successful wrist surgery, the club announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The arthroscopic wrist debridement surgery, which was performed on Monday, is a procedure in which doctors use a camera to navigate through a small incision. Often it is used to remove debris and irritants in the joints to reduce pain and inflammation.</p>
<p>The surgery was performed by Dr. Robert Hotchkiss of Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, in collaboration with team physician Dr. Dharmesh Vyas and UPMC hand and upper extremity surgery.</p>
<p>The recovery time is expected to be three to four weeks.</p>
<p>Crosby becomes the latest Penguin to undergo offseason surgery. Two weeks ago, center Evgeni Malkin had elbow surgery that’s expected to sideline him a total of three to four weeks. The same day, Zach Aston-Reese underwent left shoulder surgery that the team estimates will keep him out six months, likely into the beginning of next season.</p>
<p>While Crosby’s surgery is minimally invasive and relatively minor in the scope of sports surgeries, it continues what’s been an injury-marred and frustrating year for the Penguins captain.</p>
<p>Crosby, 33, came into training camp looking to reignite the Penguins following their disappointing four-game sweep at the hands of the New York Islanders in the 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs. However, unbeknownst to many, that redemption tour was derailed before it began when the captain suffered a core muscle injury during training camp. He chose to play through the pain initially, in part because the Penguins were already missing so many players to injury. But by mid-November, it was time to go under the knife.</p>
<p>The Penguins, somehow, posted the NHL’s best record in the 28 games without the league’s best player. They went 18-6-4 during the stretch (.714 points percentage).</p>
<p>The thinking was, if the Penguins could just add Crosby to what was already a winning club, they’d become an instant contender. Instead, their stay in the Toronto bubble lasted just four games, as they were shocked by the Montreal Canadiens in the qualifying round.</p>
<p>Crosby, who missed about half of training camp with another undisclosed injury, was one of the most productive Penguins in the shortened series. He was one of the few players to solve the puzzle that is goalie Carey Price, recording a goal and an assist in four games.</p>
<p>However, the Penguins season ended on Crosby’s 33rd birthday with a 2-0 loss. Afterward, Crosby acknowledged the frustrations over the last year.</p>
<p>“It’s been a tough year and a half,” Crosby said. “Not playing a lot of hockey with the long offseason, only playing 20 games, coming back for a short period and then having this [an upset loss in the qualifying round].”</p>
<p>In total, Crosby recorded 56 points (19 goals, 37 assists) in 41 regular season games. It’s fair to wonder how many of those he was really at 100%.</p>
