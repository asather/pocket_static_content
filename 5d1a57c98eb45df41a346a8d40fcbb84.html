<h1>Experts say U.S. still in first wave of COVID-19 cases</h1>

<p>What’s all this talk about a “second wave” of U.S. coronavirus cases?</p>
<p>Peter Navarro, the White House director of trade and manufacturing policy, said in an interview on Sunday that the White House was working to prepare for the possibility of a second wave of the coronavirus in the fall, though he said it wouldn’t necessarily come.</p>
<p>“We are filling the stockpile in anticipation of a possible problem in the fall,” Mr. Navarro told Jake Tapper on the CNN program “State of the Union.” “We’re doing everything we can.”</p>

<p>The comments come in contrast to President Trump’s repeated assertions that the virus will “go away” and his questioning of its ability to last into the fall and winter.</p>
<p>About 120,000 Americans have died from the new virus and daily counts of new cases in the U.S. are the highest they’ve been in more than a month, driven by alarming recent increases in the South and West.</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, Alabama had the second highest number of new cases per capita in the nation. South Carolina was fourth. Louisiana and Mississippi were also in the top 10.</p>
<p>“We are extremely concerned about these numbers. We know if they continue, we will see more hospitalizations and more deaths,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said.</p>
<p>As of Saturday, Alabama had more than 29,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than a quarter of the cases reported in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>The combination of preexisting health conditions and limited health care access in the region, along with pockets of public skepticism about health officials’ advice on the illness, complicate attempts to manage the virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Selwyn Vickers, dean of the UAB School of Medicine, said the South has high rates of diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease and high blood pressure — all illnesses that put people at risk for poorer outcomes with COVID-19.</p>
<p>In the West, California is experiencing a sharp climb in new coronavirus cases just weeks into a gradual economic reopening, filling hospital beds and intensive care units in an uneven surge that many public health officers predicted months ago.</p>
<p>Last week, Arizona, Florida and Texas reported their highest weekly infection-rate averages. But there is little sign that states are reconsidering politically popular decisions to open the economy. In parts of California, where more than 5,000 people have died of the virus, people will be allowed to see movies in theaters this weekend for the first time since the stay-home orders began in early March.</p>
<p>The ebbs and flows of the virus here have changed frequently from region to region in recent months. Some rural counties have seen their infection rates flatten, while others are reporting record highs. The inconsistencies have created a patchwork of public health rules, now governing a patchwork economy that happens to be the fifth-largest in the world.</p>
<p>“We’re still in the swamp,” said Sonoma County Supervisor James Gore in an interview. “And as a result, it is very hard to get people to look up and not see a lot of uncertainty in the direction we are heading.”</p>
<p>But there is at least one point of agreement: “Second wave” is probably the wrong term to describe what’s happening.</p>
<p>“When you have 20,000-plus infections per day, how can you talk about a second wave?” said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. “We’re in the first wave. Let’s get out of the first wave before you have a second wave.”</p>
<p>An initial infection peak happened in April as cases exploded in New York City. After schools and businesses were closed across the country, the rate of new cases dropped somewhat.</p>
<p>But “it’s more of a plateau, or a mesa,” not the trough after a wave, said Caitlin Rivers, a disease researcher at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security.</p>
<p>Scientists generally agree the nation is still in its first wave of coronavirus infections, albeit one that’s dipping in some parts of the country while rising in others.</p>
<p>“This virus is spreading around the United States and hitting different places with different intensity at different times,” said Dr. Richard Besser, chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who was acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when a pandemic flu hit the U.S. in 2009.</p>
<p>Dr. Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan flu expert, echoed that sentiment.</p>
<p>“What I would call this is continued transmission with flare-ups,” he said.</p>
<p>Flu seasons sometimes feature a second wave of infections. But in those cases, the second wave is a distinct new surge in cases from a strain of flu that is different than the strain that caused earlier illnesses.</p>
<p>That’s not the case in the coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>Dr. Monto doesn’t think “second wave” really describes what’s happening now, calling it “totally semantics.”</p>
<p>“Second waves are basically in the eye of the beholder,” he said.</p>
<p>But Dr. Besser said semantics matter, because saying a first wave has passed may give people a false sense that the worst is over.</p>
<p>Some worry a large wave of coronavirus might occur this fall or winter — after schools reopen, the weather turns colder and less humid, and people huddle inside more. That would follow seasonal patterns seen with flu and other respiratory viruses. And such a fall wave could be very bad, given a lack of a vaccine and experts think most Americans haven’t had the virus.</p>
<p>But the new coronavirus so far has been spreading more episodically and sporadically than flu, and it may not follow the same playbook.</p>
<p>“It’s very difficult to make a prediction,” Ms. Rivers said. “We don’t know the degree to which this virus is seasonal, if at all.”</p>
