<h1>Long-lasting flowers crowned this corona spring</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Every spring is an adventure in the garden. But when it’s a corona spring&nbsp;— with many more people at home to smell the flowers — it can be a technicolor blockbuster.</p>
<p>I’m not the only one who noticed that spring flowers seemed a little prettier and longer lasting than usual during the COVID-19 pandemic. Carol Papas, a Penn State Master Gardener for 30 years, said a mild March and chilly April kept tulips and other bulbs looking fresh for weeks in her O’Hara garden. But the occasional cold blast didn’t strip pink and white petals from the branches of cherry, dogwood, magnolia and other flowering trees.</p>
<p>“We had a relatively mild March, getting things to bloom a little early, then a freeze-free April, so all of the magnolias came through unscathed,” she said. “Once we hit a couple of really unseasonably warm days, things almost melt out and decline quickly, and that didn't happen.”</p>
<p>Pat Herald, a local meteorologist with the National Weather Service, made it official: March was 6 degrees warmer than usual and April was 3 degrees cooler, he said.</p>
<p>Gardens and yards in my neighborhood proved the point. Next-door neighbors with mature star (white) and saucer (pink) magnolias often get only two or three days of spectacular blooms before the wind scatters their petals all over the front yard. Not this year. The big floppy white flowers were still going strong when their pink, cup-shaped neighbors opened up. I’ve never seen them so beautiful together.</p>
<p>Another neighbor plants hundreds of two-toned tulips each fall in front of her Cotswold stone Tudor. Their enemies are whitetail deer, warm spells and occasionally, Mac, the family’s yellow Labrador retriever. Regular sprays of Liquid Fence kept the deer at bay, cool temps kept the orange-and-yellow flowers tightly closed and Mac didn’t meander much in the beds. The tulips stayed around so long that passersby got a few flowers to put in a vase.</p>
<p>Forsythia is the first shrub to bloom in most yards, but its greenish yellow flowers and gangly stems aren’t very picturesque. I planted it as a screen along our backyard fence many years ago and mainly use its bloom as a reminder to fertilize the lawn. This year, however, the golden flowers on every branch were so breathtaking that I took pictures.</p>
<p>Bulbs I planted years ago also decided to put on a show this year. Star of Bethlehem (<em>Ornithogalum umbellatum</em>) is a nice little white flower by itself. But plant it with Spanish bluebells and it becomes half of a classic blue-and-white duo.</p>
<p>Long-lasting iris leaves give architectural drama to any bed, but their uniquely shaped flowers&nbsp;— with or without a beard&nbsp;—&nbsp;don’t hang around for more than a few days. Yet one of my professorial friends stopped sidewalk traffic last week with a bed of purple-and-white irises that nearly hid his classic griffin statue. I was content to see my purple irises finally blooming until I saw his. Now I’m jealous.</p>
<p>As I walk our dogs, I often envy the unusual trees I see in people’s front yards. Years ago, I watched a man plant a row of three crabapple trees on his front lawn. “Bet he’ll get sick of mowing around those,” I thought. But this year, when the flowers hung like pink cotton candy, I wished they were mine.</p>
<p>Another man planted a tulip tree in the center of his yard about 20 years ago. I wondered at its name until I saw the odd greenish-yellow and orange flowers that dot its branches in late May. When the tree was small, I would stop and admire them. But as the tree stretched to about 30 feet, I barely noticed the flowers amid the leaves high above my head.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, I remembered to look up when our young Lab discovered one of the flowers on their lawn. Like most 14-month-old dogs, he showed his appreciation by trying to eat it. I showed my gratitude by letting him do it&nbsp;— after asking my neighbor if it was OK. I think she had forgotten the flowers, too. Who could forget this corona spring?</p>
