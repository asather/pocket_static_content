<h1>Port Authority to return full neighborhood service beginning Sunday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Local and coverage bus routes will return to normal service frequency for Port Authority on Sunday, and the number of riders on each vehicle will increase slightly as the agency begins a move to restore service as COVID-19 restrictions ease.</p>
<p>Safety protocols such as wearing masks, entering through rear doors and maintaining social distance from other riders and operators will remain in place, authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said the agency won’t increase service frequency on commuter, rapid routes and the light-rail system initially because Gov. Tom Wolf’s recommendation under the yellow category that Allegheny County enters on Friday recommends people continue to work from home if they can. The agency will watch ridership on those routes and increase service as it becomes necessary and it has vehicles and employees available, Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>Vehicles that are in service will be allowed to carry five more passengers each. That means 35-foot buses will be allowed to carry 15 passengers; 40-foot buses can have 20 riders; and 60-foot articulated buses and light rail cars can have 30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All buses will continue to be sanitized daily before they are put in service.</p>
<p>The authority is meeting with union and health officials this week for their guidance before the plan is put in place, Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>“Obviously, everything is contingent on those reviews,” he said.&nbsp;“We are getting ready for some people to go back to work on [May 18]. Essentially this gives people in their local communities more opportunities to go to the store and things like that.”</p>
<p>Port Authority ridership has taken a dramatic hit the past two months due to the virus emergency, losing more than 75% of its passengers and reducing service about 25%. It expects revenue losses from low ridership and increased costs for cleaning and sanitizing vehicles and facilities to reach $30 million by June 30, but those costs should be eligible for federal reimbursement through $141.75 million earmarked for the agency in federal stimulus funds.</p>
<p>We’re finalizing a plan that will allow us to safely and responsibly resume regular service while continuing to make sure our riders and employees feel safe, comfortable and protected,” CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman said in a statement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“I want to thank all of our hardworking and dedicated employees who have helped make sure that our neighbors have had continued access to food, medicine and other essential services during this difficult time, and while we anticipate that we’ll be feeling the effects for quite a while, I know that together, we will continue to move Allegheny County forward.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said the agency doesn’t know what to expect in terms of ridership next week. It won’t be increasing service to Oakland because hospitals have been operating near normal but universities have few students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We know [ridership] isn’t going to go from 0 to 100 overnight,” Mr. Brandolph said.&nbsp;“We’re going to very closely monitor ridership and make adjustment where necessary.”</p>
<p>Local routes that will return to full service are: 1; 2; 6; 8; 12; 13; 14; 15; 17; 24; 27; 31; 38; 39; 41; 44; 48; 53; 53L; 54; 56; 57; 58; 61A, B, C, D; 71A, B, C, D; 75; 81; 82; 86; 87; 88; and Y46.</p>
<p>These local routes have been at full service and won’t change: 16; 21; 51; 55; 59; 64; 67; 69; 77; 83; 91; 93; Y47 and Y49.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coverage routes returning to full service are: 4; 11; 20; 22’ 26;29; 36; 40; 43; 74; and 79.</p>
<p>Coverage routes that maintained full service are: 60; 71; and 89.</p>
