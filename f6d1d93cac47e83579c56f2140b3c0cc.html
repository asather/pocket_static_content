<h1>New WPIAL football schedules make for non-conference matchups of strong teams</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The WPIAL football schedules for all schools in 2020 are now set, and a new policy by the league has made for some terrific non-conference matchups in the first few weeks of the season.</p>
<p>How does Thomas Jefferson vs. Gateway sound in Week 1? Or Pine-Richland vs. Central Catholic, and Clairton vs. Washington in following weeks?</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, the <a href="http://wpial.org/wp-content/uploads/WPIAL-Football-Schedule-2020.pdf" target="_blank">WPIAL released those schedules</a>. The league schedules games for all 119 teams for Weeks 1 through 9, conference and non-conference. Schools can choose an opponent of their own if they decide to play a Week Zero contest.</p>
<p>Unlike previous seasons, the WPIAL hand-picked the non-conference games and the league decided to make the matchups based on competitiveness and at times geography. In the past, the league said non-conference games were picked at random. That policy often created extremely lopsided games and teams were sometimes traveling far for a meaningless non-conference matchup.</p>
<p>Also, the WPIAL decided this year to put all non-conference games in the beginning of the season. In the past, non-conference games were scheduled throughout the season. Sometimes, teams were playing a non-conference game in the last two weeks of the season.</p>
<p>Under the new schedule, teams that have been strong in the past have been matched up with other formidable opponents in non-conference games. Some teams that have struggled have been matched against teams that might make for a more competitive game.</p>
<p>“I love this. I like change,” Pine-Richland coach Eric Kasperowicz said.</p>
<p>Gateway coach Don Holl added, “If you’re building and cultivating your program and living in a culture of competitiveness, you want these type of things. Nobody is wishing they are facing murderers’ row and I don’t think we’re invincible, but who wouldn’t want to compete against the best?”</p>
<p>Pine-Richland played in the past three WPIAL Class 6A championships, but the school’s enrollment placed the Rams in Class 5A for the next two seasons. Pine-Richland will still play two Class 6A schools (Seneca Valley and Central Catholic) to open the season. In the next two weeks, Pine-Richland will play Upper St. Clair and Gateway, two strong Class 5A teams.</p>
<p>“The matchups were made for competitiveness and also location, when possible,” WPIAL associate executive director Amy Scheuneman said. “Sometimes both fit. Sometimes they did not.”</p>
<p>But what is extremely odd in the WPIAL’s new schedule is that North Allegheny was given two “open” weeks in Week 1 and 2. No other team was given two open weeks to start the season.</p>
<p>North Allegheny and Pine-Richland have developed a strong football rivalry in recent years. Kasperowicz expressed a strong desire to continue to play North Allegheny and Central Catholic, even if it were non-conference games.</p>
<p>Scheuneman added, “We had a conversation with North Allegheny and they requested to get their own games in both Week 1 and 2. Seeing how they are our largest school and we always hear the comment that nobody wants to play them, we let them get their own games. Them offering to find their own games, allowed us to schedule Week 1 and Week 2 without anyone having an opening in their schedule.”</p>
<p>At a meeting of football coaches and athletic directors a few weeks ago, the WPIAL showed a tentative schedule for non-conference games. The schedule had Pine-Richland playing North Allegheny and Central Catholic. But when the official schedules came out, the North Allegheny vs. Pine-Richland game was off.</p>
<p>“Whatever the WPIAL gives us, we’re going to go with,” Kasperowicz said. “I love to keep some of the rivalries we had with 6A teams like Seneca Valley and Central Catholic, but I’m extremely disappointed we can’t continue one of our biggest rivalries with North Allegheny. I don’t know why. I know the original schedule had us playing, but that wasn’t the final schedule. Now we’re not playing.”</p>
<p>Kasperowicz said he would like to play North Allegheny in Week Zero. But North Allegheny athletic director Bob Bozzuto said the Tigers already are scheduled to play Allderdice of the City League in Week Zero.</p>
<p>Bozzuto offered an explanation on why North Allegheny doesn’t want to play WPIAL teams in Week 1 and 2.</p>
<p>“We talked to the WPIAL and they said most people don’t want to play us anyway and it would help them scheduling if we didn’t have to have games (Week 1 and Week 2),” Bozzuto said.&nbsp;“I don’t want to play 5A schools in our area. I don’t think it’s beneficial to 6A teams. I said that last year. We took some aggravation when we played (5A) West Allegheny.”</p>
<p>Bozzuto went on to say&nbsp;“hopefully we can get two challenging games on our schedule.”</p>
<p>When asked if Pine-Richland and other WPIAL 5A schools would be challenging enough, Bozzuto said,&nbsp;“If they would’ve been in our conference, then we would’ve had to play them. I don’t want to play a 5A local team that’s not in our conference. That’s our right and our opinion. I thought there were other things the WPIAL could’ve done (with conference alignment), but there is no animosity. We just said we’re going to get our own opponents in Week 1 and Week 2.”</p>
<p>Gateway was the WPIAL Class 5A champion last year and has an extremely tough non-conference schedule. The Week 1 game against Thomas Jefferson should be highly anticipated. Thomas Jefferson is a perennial power, was 16-0 and won the PIAA Class 4A championship. Although Thomas Jefferson lost a number of starters to graduation, the Jaguars should still be strong.</p>
<p>After playing Thomas Jefferson, Gateway renews its rivalry with Penn Hills in Week 2. After that, Gateway plays Bethel Park and Pine-Richland.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to have that Penn Hills rivalry back and so is Penn Hills,” Holl said. “There’s a lot of great history in that game and it should’ve been played. Pine-Richland is probably going to be the prohibitive favorite in Class 5A heading into the season. We’ll know a lot about us early on.”</p>
<p>The first four weeks of Pine-Richland’s schedule has the Rams against Seneca Valley, Central Catholic, Upper St. Clair and Gateway.</p>
<p>Here are a few other teams that have interesting non-conference schedules to start the season:</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;Central Catholic plays Penn Hills and Pine-Richland.</p>
<p>▪ Upper St. Clair plays Mt. Lebanon, Baldwin, Pine-Richland and Penn Hills.</p>
<p>▪ Thomas Jefferson plays Gateway and South Fayette..</p>
<p>▪ Aliquippa plays Beaver Falls and Central Valley.</p>
<p>▪ Clairton plays Steel Valley and Washington.</p>
<p>Next up for the WPIAL will be to decide on playoff formats and the number of playoff qualifiers from each classification. But that probably won’t happen for a few months.</p>
<p>The PIAA still must approve brackets for the state playoffs. The PIAA approved new brackets last week, but those brackets must pass two more votes and Scheuneman cautioned those brackets could change. The PIAA won’t vote again on the new brackets until a March meeting. Thus, the WPIAL playoff format won’t be known maybe until April.</p>
