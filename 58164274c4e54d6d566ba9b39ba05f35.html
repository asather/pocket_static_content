<p>LANSING, Mich. — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Friday that governors from both major political parties have reached out to share stories of extremism in their states since authorities revealed that a group of men had been plotting for months to kidnap her.</p>
<p>“I know this isn’t unique to Michigan, but this is uniquely American in this moment and it’s on all of us, people of good will on both sides of the aisle, to take it on,” said Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat.</p>
<p>Authorities announced Thursday that they had foiled a plot to kidnap Ms. Whitmer in a scheme that even included rehearsals to snatch her from her vacation home before the Nov. 3 election. Her first term as governor runs through 2022.</p>
<p>Six men were charged in federal court with conspiring to kidnap the governor in retaliation for what they viewed as her “uncontrolled power” and then take her to Wisconsin for a “trial,” according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>The court filing described Adam Fox, who had been living below a Grand Rapids vacuum shop, as a leader.</p>
<p>Ms. Whitmer “loves the power she has right now. ... She has no checks and balances at all,” Mr. Fox said, according to FBI surveillance.</p>
<p>Separately, seven others linked to a “paramilitary group” called the Wolverine Watchmen were charged in state court for allegedly seeking to storm the Michigan Capitol and seek a civil war. Four of them were accused of helping to scout Ms. Whitmer’s second home, and both groups trained together, according to a state affidavit.</p>
<p>“There’s no question that these hate groups are domestic terrorists, and I think we need to call them that,” Ms. Whitmer said. “This is a group of people that are acting on bigotry and prejudice and acting with violence with intent to harm their fellow Americans.”</p>
<p>She said she had heard from other governors, Republican and Democratic, “to check in, to share some of the things that they’re seeing in their states as well.”</p>
<p>In New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the Michigan arrests rattled members of her family.</p>
<p>“I started to get calls from both my daughters, who were terrified and who were often included in some of the negative messaging,” she said. “Early on in this pandemic, one of the threats that we got was ‘I hope your grandchildren get COVID.’ ”</p>
<p>In August, a man pleaded guilty to making threats against the Democratic governor on social media and was sentenced to 14 months in prison.</p>
<p>At a briefing Friday, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, said elected officials “but especially at the top, must realize that words matter” and that rhetoric can lead to violence.</p>
<p>Michigan State Attorney General Dana Nessel, who joined federal prosecutors in announcing the charges, said Ms. Whitmer was regularly updated about the investigation over the past few months.</p>
<p>“There were family members that were in certain locations that we deemed to be potentially in danger and were asked to move from those locations,” Ms. Nessel said. “Unfortunately for Gov. Whitmer, she’s been the subject and the target of constant threats for quite some time now.</p>
<p>“Those threats escalated since her executive orders were issued,” Ms. Nessel said, referring to steps taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Informants and undercover agents had penetrated the groups. Arrests were made Wednesday, the same day that four of the six men charged in federal court had planned to meet to make a payment on explosives and exchange tactical gear, the FBI said.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was left for Mr. Fox’s attorney Friday.</p>
<p>Five of the six federal defendants live in Michigan. Barry Croft, who lives in Delaware, was pardoned last year by Gov. John Carney for a series of crimes there, including possession of a gun during a felony and receiving stolen property, The News Journal reported.</p>
