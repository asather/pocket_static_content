<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">CLEVELAND — Pirates third-base prospect Ke’Bryan Hayes has passed the necessary tests and will rejoin the team soon, a source told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Monday.</span></p>
<p>Hayes has been absent from spring training 2.0 because he tested positive for the coronavirus, which manager Derek Shelton announced Sunday — with Hayes’ permission.</p>
<p>Returning to play requires the player produce two negative tests in a 24-hour period, as well as undergo an EKG and a physical.</p>
<p>Hayes is the Pirates’ top position-player prospect and should eventually compete for time with Colin Moran. However, because of his delayed start, it’s likely that Hayes will start the season with Altoona, in their satellite camp.</p>
