<h1>Penguins acquire Jason Zucker from Wild; Alex Galchenyuk sent to Minnesota</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For about three years now, the Penguins have had their eye on Minnesota Wild left winger Jason Zucker.</p>
<p>Speed. Skating. Puck movement. Intelligence.</p>
<p>All of it seemed to fit the formula general manager Jim Rutherford and coach Mike Sullivan crafted during their recent back-to-back Stanley Cup runs. And they wanted more of it.</p>
<p>The Penguins tried to acquire Zucker, and even had a trade in place this offseason. But Phil Kessel, who ultimately ended up in Arizona, opted to use his partial no-trade clause to nix the deal.</p>
<p>Finally on Monday, what has been years in the making became a reality when the Penguins acquired Zucker in exchange for struggling forward Alex Galchenyuk, defensive prospect Calen Addison and a conditional 2020 first-round pick. The move strengthens a top-six that has been hit by injury and reaffirms the team's commitment to make the most of the Sidney Crosby-Evgeni Malkin window.</p>
<p>“He’s a top-six forward who skates well, shoots well, moves the puck,” Rutherford told the Post-Gazette Monday evening. “He’s an all-around player. With his foot speed, he should fit into our style of play.”</p>
<p>While the trade deadline is just two weeks away, Zucker, 28, is more than just a midseason rental. He’s under contract through the 2022-23 season with a reasonable deal that carries an average annual value of $5.5 million.</p>
<p>Rutherford said he envisions Zucker will play on Crosby’s left wing while Jake Guentzel is injured. But he said that’s ultimately Sullivan’s decision. When Guentzel returns from injury — which might not be until next season or late in the postseason at the earliest — the Penguins will have two scoring left wingers that can play in the top six.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited about our team,” Rutherford said. “Not only for this year. It’s a team that can be good for a few years. To add another player like this, not only for the run, but that we will keep him for another three years. It’s an exciting deal.”</p>
<p>Drafted in the second round (59th overall) in the 2010 NHL Draft, Zucker has played parts of nine seasons in the NHL — all with Minnesota. He’s tallied 132 goals and 111 assists in 456 career games. This year, Zucker has produced 14 goals and 15 assists in 45 games.</p>
<p>In addition to his on-ice performance, Zucker and his wife, Carly, were recognized for their various charitable efforts throughout the Minneapolis area. In 2018-19, he was the recipient of the 2018-19 King Clancy Memorial Trophy, which is presented annually “to the player who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice and has made a noteworthy humanitarian contribution in his community.”</p>
<p>In terms of what the Penguins gave up, the pick and the prospect are significant compensation. Addison is an offensive-minded defenseman in a similar mold to Kris Letang. Someday he'll have the potential to run a top power play unit. And a pick, which is protected if the Penguins miss the postseason, is obviously valuable when it comes to building for the future.</p>
<p>But the Penguins’ hope is that the pick is late in the first round and that the value they get from Zucker over the next couple seasons makes the move worthwhile.</p>
<p>“It bothers me when we trade a young player like [Calen] Addison because we like him,” Rutherford said. “We know he’s going to play [in the NHL]. But you have to give somebody to get what you want. That’s the way it works.</p>
<p>“By the time that pick and Addison are ready to play in the league, our window of opportunity may be closed. This is an opportunity to get a player to help us win now.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, giving away Galchenyuk was kind of a no-brainer at this point. It creates some salary cap space and cuts ties with a player who never figured it out during his brief time in Pittsburgh. The Penguins initially envisioned he'd play on Evgeni Malkin's left wing. But when that chemistry never materialized, Galchenyuk slid to the fourth line. He finished his Penguins tenure scoring just five goals in 45 games.</p>
<p>“He worked hard,” Rutherford said. “It just didn’t seem to work out for him. Maybe our style of play was a little bit difficult for him to adjust to. But I give him credit. He’s a good guy. He works hard. Never complained. I hope this move works for him.”</p>
<p>After acquiring Zucker and his $5.5 million cap hit from Minnesota, while sending Alex Galchenyuk ($4.9 million) the other way, the Penguins still have $922,398 in projected cap space. That's the equivalent of a $4.3 million cap hit at the trade deadline, per CapFriendly.</p>
<p>Now, with about two weeks before Feb. 24, might Rutherford use some of it in another deal before the deadline?</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “The nice thing about making this deal now is we’ll get a look at our team for about 10 days. We’ll see how things fall into place. We’ll see where we’re at at that time. We’ll have to see how [injured defensemen Brian] Dumoulin and [John] Marino are coming along, when they’re going to return. Then we can make a decision at that time.”</p>
