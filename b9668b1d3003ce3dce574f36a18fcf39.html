<h1>Pitt-Duke observations: Defending Vernon Carey, Au'Diese Toney's breakout and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>DURHAM, N.C. — Vernon Carey Jr. is a force, a 6-foot-10, 270-pound testament to the kind of ingrained advantages a program of Duke’s stature so regularly enjoys on the court and the recruiting trail.</p>
<p>The freshman center isn’t regarded as a top-tier NBA prospect in the same way a number of the Blue Devils stars were over the past several seasons, but at the college level, he remains a problem for virtually any team tasked with trying to stop him. He uses his sheer power to get near the basket. Once there, he does a good job of finishing off plays, be them lay-ups or thunderous dunks. At times, he shows an adept mid-range game. He’s smart and efficient, especially for a player his age.</p>
<p>Against a Pitt team with an obviously thin frontcourt, the challenges he presents become that much more daunting. Nonetheless, the Panthers had to try something to stop Carey on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Their plan, on paper, made perfect sense. Generally speaking, coach Jeff Capel and his team wanted to prevent Carey, Duke’s leading scorer at 17.4 points per game, from catching it deep in the paint. Almost every time he got the ball, they would double-team him, making up both for a size disadvantage for the player marking Carey, as well as Pitt’s overall lack of height, with only one player in every lineup taller than 6-foot-6.</p>
<p>Before he could even get the ball, the Panthers tried to gamble at times, either getting a player in front of Carey or having someone reach around him as he was being fed a pass. It worked on a couple of occasions, like when Terrell Brown poked at an incoming pass to Carey, leading to a turnover, and when Eric Hamilton got position in front of Carey and deflected a pass lobbed over him.</p>
<p>On a night in which he had 26 points, matching his second-highest total of the season, Carey often had his way against Pitt in a 79-67 victory. The Panthers allowed No. 9 Duke to average 1.23 points per possession, by far the highest mark an opponent has posted this season, and Carey stood as the biggest reason why (no pun intended).</p>
<p>“When we did it and we executed it right, we made it a lower-percentage shot, but we didn’t do a good job of that,” Capel said. “It’s hard, though. You can have a game plan, but then you get out there and you see the size and the footwork and the strength he has. Then when you have the touch he has, it’s a difficult cover.”</p>
<p>Playing against Hamilton, Brown and Abdoul Karim Coulibaly — over whom he had a weight advantage of 40, 35 and 55 pounds, respectively — Carey was regularly able to establish position deep in the paint and right near the basket, where he could catch a pass and finish. It can be seen here, though he also got extra room from Hamilton appearing to try to jump the passing lane.</p>

<p>Given the size disparity, there was often little Pitt’s big men could do. That’s a primary reason why double teams are used in such situations and the Panthers were able to get to men on Carey with some regularity. He was composed in those situations, though, still able to see over and past his defenders, and identify where there was an opening or vulnerability in the defense to exploit, as he did here near the top of the key.</p>

<p>In other cases, he was inexplicably left open, like when Coulibaly tried to help teammate Justin Champagnie trap Matthew Hurt along the baseline, only for Hurt to easily dish it to an open Carey for a dunk.</p>

<p>Even in moments in which Carey never touched the ball, his presence and Pitt’s effort to try to contain him were clear. Carey had made a 3-pointer in the game’s opening minutes, only his fifth of the season, and dribbled past Hamilton for a runner off the glass for his team’s first points, showing early that he had to be respected from spots as far away as the top of the key.</p>

<p>Because of that, a defender, like Hamilton here, has to stay relatively close to him near the perimeter, opening up the lane and eliminating a taller body near the basket to contest close shots. Though this play was hardly due solely to Hamilton being out on Carey — if anything, it’s Xavier Johnson breaking too far out on Jordan Goldwire, who was more than 30 feet from the rim, and Trey McGowens standing still near the basket — a clear path was nonetheless made available for Tre Jones to get an easy bucket to push Duke’s lead to 16 in the second half.</p>

<p>“That was the goal, to keep him out of the paint and not let get us in too deep in the paint because he can score it around the basket easily,” forward Au’Diese Toney said. “That was a game-changer. He got a lot of touches that changed the game.”</p>
<p>The Panthers’ defensive lapses were far from limited to Carey.</p>
<p>On two different occasions, they took a defensive gamble by giving several feet of space to Goldwire, who entered the night having attempted just 28 3s on the season (making eight of them, or 28.6%). In the first half alone, he made three 3s, increasing his season total by nearly 50% and making Pitt pay in the process. On his first one, he had enough time to take a couple of dribbles and deliberate whether to shoot.</p>

<p>Part of that is a bout of bad luck —&nbsp;a player who rarely shoots from deep and when he does, doesn’t do it well, going three of seven from beyond the arc — but it’s also a risk that backfired.</p>
<p>“We wanted to try to clog the lane,” Capel said. “We wanted to try to make some other guys make some shots that hadn’t done it on a consistent level all year. He stepped up and make some big-time shots for them.”</p>
<p><strong>Au’Diese Toney was a revelation</strong></p>
<p>For as poorly as Pitt fared defensively, it underscored what was one of its better offensive showings of the season, especially considering where it was playing and against whom it was playing.</p>
<p>Prior to Tuesday, Duke ranked fifth among 353 Division I teams in defensive efficiency, allowing fewer than 90 points per 100 possessions, but the Panthers scored 67 points on 64 possessions, the second-highest points-per-possession average the Blue Devils had allowed in a game this season.</p>
<p>Any discussion of how that happened begins, and likely ends, with Toney. Pitt’s sophomore forward exploded for a career-high 27 points, which is only six fewer points than he scored in the first seven games of the season combined. That tally was highlighted by an array of dunks that not only quieted an energetic crowd in an intimate venue but showed off his athleticism in a way he hadn’t in a single game in his Pitt career.</p>

<p>Others areas of his game, even beyond scoring, were also impressive. He aggressively led a break and was able to finish through Carey, who was draped on him as he rose for the lay up, and display some nice touch, especially considering how quickly he was moving.</p>

<p>He made contested 3s late in the shot clock and finished the evening having gone 3 of 4 from beyond the arc after having gone 7 of 26 in his team’s first 20 games. He showed a nice dribble-drive element to his game, like when he penetrated the lane, attracted a defender and immediately dumped it off to Terrell Brown for a dunk (apologies for ESPN’s decision to split-screen here).</p>

<p>“Really, it was nothing different,” Toney said. “It was just making shots, picking your spots, being confident and knocking them down.”</p>
<p>It was the highlight for a wing who has been perhaps as good as any Pitt player, aside from maybe Champagnie, over the past five weeks. In his past 11 games —&nbsp;he missed two, a loss to Wake Forest and a win at North Carolina, with an elbow injury — Toney has averaged 10.9 points per game while shooting 56.4% from the field. In the prior eight games, he averaged 4.9 points per game and shot just 32.4%.</p>
<p><strong>Numbers of note</strong></p>
<p><strong>64</strong>: Possessions each team had in the game. Pitt may have lost the contest, but it won the tempo battle. Duke was 46th nationally in pace, averaging more than 71 possessions per game, but Pitt, 334th in pace and averaging 64 possessions per game, forced its opponent into a slower game.</p>
<p><strong>14</strong>: Minutes played by Pitt guard Ryan Murphy, a season low. He was scoreless and attempted just one shot in that time, both his lowest marks of the season.</p>
<p><strong>20</strong>: Consecutive road games lost by Pitt against ranked teams.</p>
