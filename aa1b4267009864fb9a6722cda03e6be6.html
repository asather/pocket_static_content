<h1>Penguins' Dominik Simon sidelined after April shoulder surgery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If the NHL finds a way to resume the 2019-20 season this summer, the Penguins will likely be without one of their forwards.</p>
<p>Dominik Simon tore the labrum in his left shoulder during a Feb. 29 meeting with the San Jose Sharks. He underwent successful surgery on April 29, the team announced Thursday.&nbsp;The injury is expected to keep him sidelined for six to seven months.</p>
<p>During a season in which the Penguins endured numerous injuries to several key players, Simon was one of just four Penguins to play in the first 64 games. He tallied 22 points (seven goals and 15 assists) while playing on a number of different lines.</p>
<p>Even before the injury, there were questions about how Simon would fit in the Penguins new-look lineup this summer. The club bolstered its forward corps in the trade market by acquiring Jason Zucker, Conor Sheary, Evan Rodrigues and Patrick Marleau. Those additions already slid Simon from the top line to the bottom-six.</p>
<p>Now, the prolonged pause due to COVID-19 has given Jake Guentzel an opportunity to recover. With Guentzel likely in the fold, the Penguins could have as many as 16 healthy forwards to choose from in a possible summer hockey format. The injury could open the door for more players on the fringe of the roster such as Rodrigues, Sam Lafferty or Anthony Angello.</p>
<p>When the offseason arrives, the Penguins will have some decisions to make.</p>
<p>Simon, 25, carries a cap hit of $750,000. He’ll become a restricted free agent this offseason and will be one of many key restricted free agents or unrestricted free agents the Penguins will have to bring to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>He’s an interesting case. One one hand, his puck possession skills and ability to navigate in tight spaces makes him a player Penguins coach Mike Sullivan trusts playing as high as the top line with captain Sidney Crosby. On the other hand, his finishing ability leaves more than a little bit to be desired.</p>
