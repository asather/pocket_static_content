<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: If USA Today predictions are right, why should anyone support the Pirates?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Howard:</strong>&nbsp;USA Today projected the Pirates to lose 102 games. Do you think that is a fair assessment of the team? And if that is, why should anyone buy a ticket to go to a game?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Some people are acting like this is some sort of outlandish pick. The Pirates lost 95 games last year, and this year they have basically said — by their actions — that they are going to tank. They traded Starling Marte already, and who knows what’s next. I mean, I would expect them to trade Adam Frazier, Keone Kela and Chris Archer by the trade deadline, which means the second half could be really ugly. I look at their pitching staff and lineup and say to myself&nbsp;“This is a team that will win between 62 and 66 games,” which is right in the neighborhood of what USA Today projects. I can’t tell you why to buy tickets or why to be a fan, but I can say this: A true fan stays through thick and thin. And this is a new regime that deserves the benefit of the doubt. If nothing else, the ballpark is a great place to watch baseball and the food there is great.</p>
<p><strong>Janet:</strong> Why does everyone say they Pirates should trade Josh Bell? Don’t they need to start to sign their younger star players? Why wouldn’t they offer him a big deal to stay here? It is so annoying watching the best players leave all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I agree. If the Pirates trade Bell, it would be a big mistake. He is a player capable of hitting 40 home runs every year. Those players are necessary, and they don’t come cheap. Bob Nutting could go a long way toward showing that he is serious about doing things differently by signing Bell to a long-term deal. It would show that he is interested in fielding the best team possible. And he wouldn’t have to break the bank, either. I don’t think Bell is a $200 million player. I think something like six years at $110 million would do the trick.</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong> Of the recent "crop" of free agents the Pirates signed, do you think any will be decent? I believe JT Riddle can be a good bench piece, but that's it.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;Who knows ... I honestly look at the list of guys going to spring training and think of that scene from “Major League” where they are discussing the players who are being invited to spring training for the Indians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I've never heard of half of these guys and the ones I do know are way past their prime.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Most of these guys never had a prime.”</p>
<p>“This guy here is dead...”</p>
<p>“Cross him off, then...”</p>
<p><strong>The Jake:</strong> How are the Chiefs possibly going to afford to keep their team together after they pay Patrick Mahomes? What do you think is realistic for his contract?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I think one thing that has happened in recent years is teams have done a better job of planning for big quarterback contracts. When the quarterbacks first started cashing in on those big contracts, teams weren’t really ready for it, but I don’t think that’s the case anymore. I think the Chiefs will have a plan to make sure they can balance the younger players (cheaper players) in key positions and still be able to have a few stars around Mahomes. And Jared Goff got $110 million, so the sky is the limit for Mahomes.</p>
<p><strong>Larry:</strong> Is there anyway the Steelers could trade Ben Roethlisberger, get the cap relief that comes with it and then sign a cheaper free agent such as Case Keenum or Teddy Bridgewater, and look to draft a young quarterback in the next year or two? This is going to be one of the worst contracts in history.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Well, I think if they trade him, there is still a big cap hit from the dead money, so that’s a bad plan. It is a terrible contract. The Steelers are stuck with it, though. Their best course of action is to hope he is healthy and comes back and plays well. If he doesn’t, that contract will be the most expensive pork chop anyone has ever had to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Is there any chance the Steelers just let Bud Dupree walk and use that money to shore up multiple positions? I think $16 million is a lot to tie up in one position, especially when you already have $36 million tied up in your quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> No, they have already said he is a priority.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> Is Penn State basketball for real? Are they going to make the NCAA tournament? If they played Pitt, who would win?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:&nbsp;</strong>They are a really good team, yes. Are they Final Four good? Maybe not, but they are going to be a tough out in the NCAA tournament. They are better than Pitt but not by such a wide margin that you can assume they would win. It would be a close game.</p>
<p><strong>Nate:&nbsp;</strong>Are you going to watch any of the XFL when it debuts this weekend, or are you not interested in minor-league/spring football?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;You didn’t really ask me this, did you? I suppose if I’m at home and bored to tears and flipping through the channels and come across it, I would stop and watch. ... Actually, maybe not...</p>
