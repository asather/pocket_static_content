<h1>Food bank organizes drive-up distributions today at airport, Friday at PPG Paints Arena</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank continues to provide food to those hit hard financially by the coronavirus pandemic, with its largest emergency distribution event yet — at Pittsburgh International Airport.</p>
<p>Today’s drive-up distribution takes place from <strong>1 to 3 p.m., today</strong> in the airport parking lots.</p>
<p>The food bank said it plans to serve 1,500 vehicles and that each vehicle will receive two boxes of food (enough for at least 20 meals).</p>
<p>“The airport is an ideal location. It will be one of our largest distributions to&nbsp;date,” said Lisa Scales, food bank president and CEO. The food bank has held nearly a dozen drive-up distributions since March. Theirs and other food banks and pantries have served hundreds of people who have waited in long lines at distributions held across the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>To make the process run smoothly, the food bank asks that people stay in their vehicles and unlock their trunk or backseat door so volunteers can place the food into their car.</p>
<p>Those needing more food help should contact their local food pantry or contact the food bank for help in locating a pantry near where you live, according to the nonprofit.</p>
<p>Another food distribution is scheduled from <strong>10 a.m. to 1 p.m., Friday</strong> at PPG Paints Arena in Downtown Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The food bank is working again with the Pittsburgh Penguins and Allegheny-Fayette Central Labor Council to conduct the distribution.</p>
<p>The nonprofit said it will have enough food for&nbsp;2,000 vehicles, with each receiving two boxes of food.</p>
<p>For both events, no walk-ups will be permitted due to safety concerns.&nbsp;Pittsburgh police will be assisting with traffic control.</p>
<p>Those needing more food help should contact their local food pantry or <a href="https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/get-help/" target="_blank">visit the food bank’s website for help</a> in locating a pantry near where you live, according to the nonprofit. The website includes a map of food pantries, meals for children and SNAP (food stamps) application assistance.</p>
