<h1>Coronavirus testing now offered with a doctor’s approval, CDC says</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Federal health officials announced on Wednesday that anyone who wants a coronavirus test may get one if a doctor agrees. But the nation’s testing capacity is still so limited that experts feared clinics and hospitals could be overwhelmed by an avalanche of requests.</p>
<p>Under the new criteria, patients who have fevers, coughs or difficulty breathing qualify for diagnostic testing, depending on their doctor’s judgment. But with flu season in full swing, tens of millions of Americans have respiratory symptoms, and doctors have no quick way to discern who should be tested.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has repeatedly promised to expand the nation’s testing capabilities by the end of the week, even as state laboratories estimated that it would be weeks before millions of American could be tested.</p>
<p>“We are already overwhelmed with calls day and night,” said Julie Vaishampayan, public health officer of Stanislaus County in Modesto, Calif. Public health laboratories in California are already working seven days a week, she said.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s Wednesday announcement came as the&nbsp;president said a “very detrimental” decision adopted under his predecessor initially hampered the ability to enact widespread testing for the virus.</p>
<p>Even as federal officials were announcing the new testing criteria, the House and the Senate agreed to provide $8.3 billion to combat the spread of the coronavirus. By the end of the day, the death toll in the United States had risen to 11 and the number of confirmed cases to 157.</p>
<p>Ten deaths have occurred in the Seattle area, which is emerging as an epicenter. But on Wednesday, California reported its first death from the infection, as well as six new cases in the Los Angeles area, and Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency.</p>
<p>In the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, doctors were encouraged to rule out other causes of respiratory illness and to take into consideration whether there are other local coronavirus cases before ordering a test.</p>
<p>Health care workers who had close contact with a known coronavirus patient within 14 days of developing symptoms — as well as anyone who traveled recently to China, Iran, Italy, Japan or South Korea — might also be candidates for testing.</p>
<p>The CDC’s new criteria essentially relegate the decision to test to individual physicians who have little experience with, and scant scientific evidence about, coronavirus. Doctors cannot perform the tests themselves and must refer patients to state or local laboratories.</p>
<p>“You need some sort of framework within which to work,” said William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. “Not every patient who walks into the doctor’s office with a cough needs to be tested.”</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that “all laboratories at the state level can conduct coronavirus tests without any additional assets or resources from the federal government.”</p>
<p>Some 2,500 testing kits “are going out this week,” capable of testing 1.5 million patients, he said.</p>
<p>But a surge in coronavirus testing by people who have no real need may divert resources from seriously ill patients whose diagnosis is unknown, experts said. When the diagnosis is uncertain, it is difficult to know how to use limited protective gear appropriately or whether to isolate the patient.</p>
<p>The nation’s testing capacity is being expanded, now that private labs and companies are being allowed to make their own tests. But the process has only begun, and it will take time to ramp up the production of new testing kits.</p>
<p>The CDC distributed its own diagnostic test kits to state and local health departments last month, but they turned out to be flawed, producing sometimes inconclusive results. The CDC offered partial replacements, but on Saturday the Trump administration announced that commercial and academic institutions would be permitted to make their own.</p>
<p>Many public health laboratories say they still have not received diagnostic kits, or are in the process of running checks to ensure they are working properly. Laboratories around the country are still not ready to test large numbers of samples.</p>
<p>Once they are operating, the labs can process only about 100 tests per day.</p>
<p>Officials with the Association of Public Health Laboratories said this week that member laboratories eventually would be able to conduct about 10,000 tests a day. On Tuesday, 54 labs were running at full capacity; another 46 are expected to be up running by Saturday.</p>
<p>Commercial tests — such as those developed by companies like Cepheid, Hologic and Qiagen — are expected to greatly increase capacity, but representatives for those companies said they were weeks away from approval by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Hologic has said that once its tests are available, labs could run about 1,000 tests per day, but only if the labs did not also run other tests for other viruses, like the flu or HIV.</p>
<p>“They’re not going to be able to test everyone, and if we let everyone through for testing, the people who really need it won’t be able to get it,” said Dr. Vaishampayan, the health official in California. “We can’t do that for the whole state,” where there are 40 million people.</p>
<p>“There has to be some sort of prioritization,” she added.</p>
<p>As a general rule, screening for infectious diseases requires some sort of winnowing of potential candidates, experts said.</p>
<p>Priority should be given to people who are involved in an investigation of an outbreak — as well as their contacts, and exposed health care workers — and to symptomatic people who have returned from trips to affected regions, Dr. Schaffner said.</p>
<p>People with symptoms who are at high risk for complications and severe illness because of underlying health conditions — such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and lung disease — should receive priority, as well as individuals who are older and frail.</p>
<p>Flu also should be ruled out before coronavirus testing is considered, Dr. Schaffner suggested.</p>
<p>Until last week, the CDC refused to test patients for the novel coronavirus if they had not been to China recently or had contact with a known, identified patient.</p>
<p>But a severely ill hospital patient in Sacramento waited days to get a coronavirus test approved, and then days more to get the test processed at CDC laboratories in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Following mounting criticism, the agency’s diagnostic criteria were slightly loosened to allow testing of certain hospitalized patients who did not have a clear exposure to the coronavirus and to include four additional countries where the virus has taken root.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;President Donald Trump sought on Wednesday to deflect criticism of his administration’s response to the coronavirus onto his predecessor, complaining that a federal agency decision under then-President Barack Obama had made it harder to quickly enact widespread testing for the virus.</p>
<p>“The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing, and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion,” Mr. Trump said. “That was a decision we disagreed with. I don’t think we would have made it, but for some reason it was made. But we’ve undone that decision.”</p>
<p>It was not entirely clear what he was referring to. Health experts and veterans of the government during Mr. Obama’s presidency said they were unaware of any policy or rule changes during the last administration that would have affected the way the Food and Drug Administration approved tests during the current crisis. Moreover, if there were, Mr. Trump did not explain why his administration did not change the rules during its first three years in office.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump appeared intent on focusing attention on the Obama administration at a time when his own handling of the outbreak has come under intense criticism. He made a point of using the former president’s name in comments to reporters during a White House meeting with airline executives, called to discuss the economic effect of the virus.</p>
<p>Among other things, critics have pointed to the dismantling of a White House effort set up by Mr. Obama to respond to global health emergencies. The officials involved have left and not been replaced over the past two years, a point made by Obama administration veterans in recent days.</p>
<p>No coronavirus issue has attracted as much attention as testing, which even now lags behind other countries dealing with the virus. Local health agencies have complained that a lack of coronavirus tests has hindered their abilities to identify patients, and tight restrictions imposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on who could be tested have meant that some infected patients waited days before a diagnosis. The last restrictions were lifted Tuesday.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure the American people can go to their doctor, can go to the local MedCheck or CVS and obtain access to coronavirus” tests, Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration’s response to the virus, said Wednesday during a White House meeting with laboratory executives.</p>
<p>In raising the testing issue, the president appeared to refer to a practice that limited the ability of laboratories run by states, universities and private companies to conduct medical screenings not approved by the FDA.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the agency’s commissioner, Stephen Hahn, allowed those labs to use tests that they had independently developed. The labs had to submit evidence of the tests’ accuracy before the FDA completes its review. Dozens of labs have now applied for emergency approval under the decision.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC director, said the change was quickly making tests more available. “It’s really very important,” he said at the White House event with Mr. Trump. “It’s what’s changed the availability of testing overnight.”</p>
<p>Michelle Forman, a spokeswoman for the Association of Public Health Laboratories, whose members had complained that the FDA took too long to approve their tests, said there were some discussions during the Obama administration about whether to tighten restrictions on laboratories that developed their own tests, but “nothing was ever put into place.”</p>
<p>Mr. Obama did not immediately respond to the president’s remarks on Wednesday, but he separately posted a message on Twitter urging Americans to follow advice from the CDC.</p>
<p>“Protect yourself and your community from coronavirus with common sense precautions: wash your hands, stay home when sick and listen to the @CDCgov and local health authorities,” he wrote. “Save the masks for health care workers. Let’s stay calm, listen to the experts, and follow the science.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, joining the meeting with airline executives, which had been set to be led by Mr. Pence, sought to reassure Americans that the outbreak was under control and portrayed the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of international flights to affected countries like China as a boon for domestic travel.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are doing a lot of domestic business now, I can tell you,” the president said. “They’re staying in this country. They feel safe because we have a — if you look at a percentage, we have a very, very small percentage” of infections.</p>
<p>Asked if he considered it safe to fly, Mr. Trump pointed at the executives around his table: “Where these people are flying, it’s safe to fly.”</p>
<p>But the airline executives made clear that they were struggling to convince passengers of that. “Right now, the fear is almost worse than the virus,” Nicholas E. Calio, the president and chief executive of Airlines for America, the trade association for leading passenger and cargo airlines, told Mr. Trump, gently pressing him to do more to reassure the traveling public.</p>
<p>The president did not directly offer any additional help. “Yeah, no, we’re doing a good job,” he responded.</p>
<p>But the famously germ-phobic Mr. Trump said he was doing his part by following medical advice on how to avoid becoming infected. “I haven’t touched my face in weeks,” he said. “Been weeks. I miss it.”</p>
