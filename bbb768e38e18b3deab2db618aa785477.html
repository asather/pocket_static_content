<h1>Long-haul Texas trucker, local distributor get federal prison in cocaine case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A self-employed long-haul trucker caught hauling cocaine from Houston to Neville Island and a local buyer who met him there for deals are headed to federal prison, each for eight years.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Marilyn Horan imposed those terms Thursday in video sentencing hearings for Lino Espinoza, 45, of Houston, and Eric Timbers, 43, formerly of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Federal court remains open but hearings are either being postponed or conducted remotely because of COVID-19. Espinoza and Timbers agreed to be sentenced by video from jail.</p>
<p>The men were the targets of an investigation by the state attorney general's office, Pittsburgh police and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
<p>Agents and police said the two conspired from June 2017 until they were arrested on March 21, 2019, to distribute cocaine in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Search warrants in the case remain sealed, but detention and plea hearings indicated that Espinoza had been making trips from Houston to Neville Island as part of what prosecutors said was a large-scale cocaine operation. Agents were watching on March 21, 2019, when Espinoza arrived in his truck for a deal with Timbers and took them into custody.</p>
<p>Law officers said Espinoza, a native of Mexico who became a U.S. citizen in 2012, was transporting five kilos of cocaine in a secret compartment installed in his truck. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brendan Conway said at a detention hearing that the evidence suggests he had made many other trips to Pittsburgh and elsewhere to deliver drugs. Espinoza's own lawyer said at the hearing that his client was acting as a "mule," or courier.</p>
<p>Agents also found a gun in Espinoza's truck, but he had acquired it legally and was not charged with a weapons offense.</p>
<p>As part of his plea, he forfeited his truck and $347,000.</p>
