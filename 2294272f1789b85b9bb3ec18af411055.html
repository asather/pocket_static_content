<p>Nick Bjugstad underwent surgery Tuesday and will not suit up for the Penguins whenever the season resumes, general manager Jim Rutherford said.</p>
<p>It was the latest setback in a tough season for Bjugstad, who was injured early in the season, underwent core muscle surgery in November and suffered another injury within a few days of returning to the lineup in early March.</p>
<p>Bjugstad played just 13 games this season, tallying a goal and an assist.</p>
<p>Rutherford said Wednesday on a conference call that Bjugstad, who was trying to work his way back from a lower-body injury, experienced a setback.</p>
<p>Bjugstad told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month that he trying to stay positive about his injury-marred season and was excited to potentially play this summer.</p>
<p>“I haven’t played many games this year. I don’t want to get used to it. I’m itching to get back,” he said. “And if we can somehow make up for those games and play the playoffs this summer, I’m all for it. If we have to sacrifice this summer, that’s something, from an individual perspective, that would be great.”</p>
<p>Bjugstad was a candidate to center the team’s third line during the playoffs. With Bjugstad shut down, Jared McCann is the favorite to fill that role.</p>
<p>While the Penguins were hoping for contributions from Bjugstad, Rutherford said the team has enough depth to get by. He specifically mentioned the additions of Patrick Marleau, Conor Sheary and Evan Rodrigues at the trade deadline and also the presence of rookie forwards Sam Lafferty and Anthony Angello.</p>
