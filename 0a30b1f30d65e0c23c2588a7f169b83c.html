<h1>When the next COVID-19 wave hits, will things go smoother?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There isn’t much silver lining to the idea of another wave of COVID-19 infections and the consequences now visible all over the United States.</p>
<p>But organizations that had to jump into a lockdown phase the first time around have retained the knowledge they gained in that process, hopefully meaning there’s potential for a safer and more organized round of pandemic-necessitated closures if needed.</p>
<p>Prodigo Solutions, a Cranberry-based company that coordinates medical supply chains, was aware early on that the pandemic was a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>The company instituted a mandatory work-from-home policy for all employees, with leadership aware that Prodigo’s services —&nbsp;which support the ordering of personal protective equipment and other supplies for health systems across the United States — would be critical.</p>
<p>And the company hasn’t gone back to anything resembling normal in-person office work since, something that will make it relatively easy to return to a completely remote operation if needed.</p>
<p>“Even today, there may be four to six people that come into an office that can fit, probably, up to 75,” said Bob Pavlik, executive vice president of business development for Prodigo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Wesbanco, a Wheeling, W.Va.-based bank, putting safety protocols in place was a process of learning what worked best for employees and getting everyone used to the new normal.</p>
<p>“Our infrastructure, from an IT perspective, was set up to be able to move quickly, so we were able to do that,” said Tony Pietranton, human resources executive vice president. “At first, we had some employees that were reluctant to work remote[ly]. They felt they had to come into the office to be effective, but we worked with them and got them comfortable with that process.”</p>
<p>Wesbanco kept its 236 branches partially open during the start of the pandemic, but eventually decided to close the bank lobbies and rely on drive-thru service.</p>
<p>And like Prodigo Solutions, another lockdown for Wesbanco likely wouldn’t look too different from the bank’s current circumstances.</p>
<p>“We still are having employees work remotely as much as we can,” Mr. Pietranton said.</p>
<p>At Downtown law firm Sherrard, German &amp; Kelly, administrators began organizing for a shift to remote work relatively early on — expediting purchases of laptops to be configured for employees to use at home and dividing staff into teams to cut down how many people were in the office at a given time.</p>
<p>“As a result of all of that, when the governor’s order came down that basically sent everybody home, we were able to continue working from home —&nbsp;staff, attorneys and everybody else — relatively seamlessly,” said Matt A. Jarrell, managing shareholder and director of Sherrard, German &amp; Kelly.</p>
<p>“Attorneys can come in if they want to, but they’re generally encouraged to work from home while these counts are relatively high,” Mr. Jarrell said.</p>
<p>NursingABC, a Beaver Falls-based nursing school prep company,&nbsp;already had a number of remote employees prior to the pandemic, which made the transition easier. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The critical elements of successfully running a mostly-remote business, according to Michael Witterman, NursingABC director of operations, are communication and “intentionality” —&nbsp;that is, knowing what your next steps will be and why —&nbsp;as well as recognizing and affirming employees throughout the process while also recognizing that they may be in difficult home and life situations under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>“I feel like we stabilized really quickly, and the work that we did continued to move forward,” Mr. Witterman said.</p>
