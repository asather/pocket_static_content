<h1>Aquinas Academy Crusaders fencing teams are building traditions, life skills</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At Aquinas Academy in Hampton the clash of blades resounded throughout the school hall near the gymnasium entrance. Movie night with an old swashbuckler film or, perhaps, “The Princess Bride”? Not quite.</p>
<p>Outside the door, a club banner depicted an Aquinas Academy Crusader cast in blue monochromatic tones with the fencing club motto “Vires Re Aspera,” Latin for “Strength through adversity.”</p>
<p>Once through the entry, neat blue lines taped to the hardwood gym floor outlined the boundaries of several fencing strips or “pistes.” Three bouts were in progress, one between 12-year-old sixth graders and the other between more experienced upper school fencers, who are members of the competitive team. The boys varsity team captain, Sam Everson, was refereeing that bout and calling the touches while Sejal Sharma, the girls team captain, looked on.</p>
<p>Around the gym, boys and girls ranging in age from 12 to 16 attired in pristine white knickers, fencing jackets with the Aquinas Academy crest emblazoned on the sleeve, and a somewhat ominous black fencing mask disguising their youthful faces, practiced various aspects of their newfound sport. Some hit wall targets, while at the far end of the facility, head coach John Carroll was giving others a group session on types of blade actions.</p>
<p>Fencing is one the oldest modern day Olympic sports with its roots in the martial arts of the past. But at Aquinas Academy it is one of the newest sports. It has grown in the past five years to a school club with more than 20 members.</p>
<p>Two seasons ago, school director Leslie Mitros allotted more resources to the program.</p>
<p>“Senior Harry Hardman started the team four years ago,” she said. “We had five fencers the first year, two boys and three girls. The second year we had three boys and no girls. That year the boys came in third place in the Pittsburgh league. We were having some success, and I could see we could expand the program and allow more students the opportunity to participate.</p>
<p>“To my knowledge there are only two other schools in Pittsburgh that introduce fencing in the middle school. I didn’t expect such a great response, but I am very pleased. Fencing is a different sport and lends itself well to a small school like Aquinas. It enables us to compete successfully against the largest private and public schools.”</p>
<p>Coach Carroll echoed her sentiments. “It is more than just a great aerobic activity,” he said. “It requires all the athleticism of any sport, agility, flexibility and speed, but more importantly it has a uniquely cerebral characteristic. Often, it is called physical chess because it requires the fencer to assess a situation and make rational decisions in a fast-moving situation. It teaches how to overcome obstacles in life. That’s why the club motto is ‘Strength through adversity.’</p>
<p>“We want to teach our kids that it is only through facing adversity and handling disappointment that we can truly become strong. We believe that the life skills learned here in the fencing hall should translate to all aspects of life, enabling our students to become happy and well-adjusted adults. That is the real objective. On top of all that, it’s social and just plain fun.”</p>
<p>It appears that Aquinas is already building traditions. Within the past four years, the boys varsity team made the playoffs twice, finishing with the bronze medal in the Pittsburgh Interscholastic Fencing Association. This year the school anticipates fielding boys and girls varsity and junior varsity team, and will be presenting fencing exhibition matches with a boys and girls middle school team. Aquinas fencers are going for the gold, but Ms. Mitros and Coach Carroll agree that it is not about winning but rather about teaching how to meet life’s challenges.</p>
