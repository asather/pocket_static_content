<h1>Mariner East pipeline worker charged with felony for falsifying weld records</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A pipeline worker from Westmoreland County will plead guilty to a felony for forging documents that said a weld on the Mariner East pipeline was properly x-rayed when, in reality, it was not.</p>
<p>Joshua Springer, of Scottdale, worked on Energy Transfer’s Mariner East 2 pipeline project between May 2017 and June 2018.</p>
<p>For the most part, he was assigned to work on a 20-mile segment between Houston and Delmont. His job involved taking x-rays of welds, interpreting that data to ensure the weld was good and recording his findings in records that would go to Energy Transfer. It is not clear from the court records which company Mr. Springer worked for.</p>
<p>Documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania indicate Mr. Springer is scheduled to plead guilty to the charge during an April 1 hearing. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine up to $250,000.</p>
<p>But that’s unlikely to be the end of the story.&nbsp;A notification about Mr. Springer’s felony charge posted on the Department of Transportation’s Office of Inspector General’s website indicates that the investigation is ongoing and is being conducted with the FBI.</p>
<p>The Mariner East pipelines —&nbsp;there are three that run mostly parallel to each other — carry natural gas liquids between the Marcellus and Utica Shales in Ohio, West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania to processing facilities near Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The $3-billion construction project has been plagued by a number of problems, including sinkholes, landslides, water contamination and other environmental permit violations.</p>
<p>On the pipeline safety and integrity front, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Transportation, has sent Energy Transfer numerous warning letters over the course of Mariner East pipeline construction, alleging non-compliance with federal regulations and its own company policies.</p>
<p><em>This story will be updated if responses are received from state regulators and Energy Transfer. They were not immediately available when contacted for comment.</em></p>
