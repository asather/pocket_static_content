<h1>Teen wanted in Wilkins shooting arrested</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A teenager who was wanted in connection with a shooting that left another teen in critical condition last week in Wilkins was arrested Thursday, court records show.</p>
<p>Police responded just before 9 p.m. on Jan. 24 to a shooting that happened in the 100 block of Ivy Street. A male juvenile had been shot multiple times, police said. He was taken to the Forbes Regional Hospital in critical condition and was released four days later after having surgery, a criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>An arrest warrant was issued for Shawn N. Frye-Culbreth, 17, of Verona, who was charged Thursday with&nbsp;attempted homicide, two counts of aggravated assault, robbery of vehicle, two counts of theft, receiving stolen property, carrying a firearm without a license and possession of a firearm by a minor.</p>
<p>Police said the incident originated a minute away at a vacant property in the 500 block of Tongalucas Street, where the juvenile had arranged through the Snapchat phone app to meet and sell marijuana to Shawn.</p>
<p>The juvenile told police he met Shawn&nbsp;at the Tongalucas Street address, and the two went back and forth over prices. Shawn asked the victim to come inside for payment, the complaint said, although the victim said he didn’t feel comfortable. He eventually exited his vehicle and complied.</p>
<p>Soon after, Shawn allegedly pulled a gun on the victim and told him to “drop everything,” the complaint said. Shawn allegedly began firing shots at the juvenile, while another person appeared and also began shooting at him.</p>
<p>The juvenile, who said he knew Shawn from school, ran to a home on Ivy Street where a neighbor called police, the complaint said.</p>
<p>The juvenile told police his car was stolen and was seen speeding away moments after the shooting. It was later found Jan. 28 in Monroeville through an abandoned vehicle report.</p>
<p>Authorities found three .22-caliber bullet casings at the scene and a digital scale, the criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for Feb. 13.</p>
