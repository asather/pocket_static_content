<h1>UPMC newborns get special outfits in honor of Pittsburgh's 'H' Day</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was a historic day to be born in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital dressed newborn babies in a special outfit Sunday to honor&nbsp;“H” Day — the day when Pittsburgh got the “h” back at the end of the city’s name 109 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1880, the U.S. government dropped the&nbsp;“h” from all names that ended in “burg” to keep them consistent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 19, 1911, however, Pittsburgh was given its “h” back, marking the annual date&nbsp;“H” Day in the Steel City.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPMC posted photos to its social media pages Sunday of newborn babies sporting&nbsp;“H” Day onesies that read&nbsp;“Pittsburgh’s newest neighbor.” The onesies were donated by PGH Apparel, a clothing company in Forest Hills.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“In honor of this occasion, PGH Apparel donated these onesies to Pittsburgh's newest neighbors. All babies born at Magee today will receive a special onesie to commemorate the anniversary of H Day. We thank PGH Apparel for their generosity,” the hospital’s post read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The City of Pittsburgh Twitter account said in a tweet Sunday that the city&nbsp;“fought for decades” to restore the “h” in its name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s official government Twitter account also commemorated the day.</p>
