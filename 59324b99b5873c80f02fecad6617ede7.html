<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: MLB set to return, but does anyone actually care?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Baseball owners and players <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/23/mlbpa-players-will-report-health-safety-protocols/stories/202006230125" target="_blank">have resolved their differences</a>, but will anyone care about the season at this point? The greatest asset baseball has is that it is played in the middle of summer when little else is going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of getting a boost from being the first professional sport to return, baseball may now be the last to return. And if baseball is going head-to-head with the NBA, college football and the NFL, I doubt anyone will care about the&nbsp;Major League Baseball season outside of Boston, New York and L.A. MLB will probably fall behind hockey too in some cities like Pittsburgh where apathy was already growing with the sport due to the economic structure pre-COVID. MLB screwed this up big time. Do you agree?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I don’t agree. I think a lot of fans still care. Some will huff and puff about how they won’t come back, but baseball saved the season, and that’s what fans ultimately wanted. I can’t imagine that kind of&nbsp;“I am staying away” stuff will last more than a week or two. And as for the big markets versus the small markets, a 60-game season actually gives the small market teams a chance. You can’t fool the baseball gods for 162 games because depth and overall talent is so important for the long haul. With a short sample size, though, you can. The Pirates need to have one good stretch of about 20-24 games, and they can compete.</p>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> What do you think of the Pirates schedule? Why are the playing the AL Central and not the AL East? We were supposed to watch them play the Yankees this year.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> The schedule is really interesting and makes sense They will play 10 games each against the Cardinals, Cubs, Reds and Brewers. Then they will play four games against each of the AL Central teams (White Sox, Royals, Indians, Tigers and Twins). The key is trying to minimize travel, and if you put those two divisions together, they are all roughly in the same footprint. Kansas City is the western most team, Minnesota the northern most team, Cincinnati the southern most team and Pittsburgh the eastern most team.</p>
<p><strong>Greg:</strong> I want to know why the designated hitter has to be a part of the National League? Is it making the game safer? Is it protecting pitchers or something? I hate it. The National League is supposed to be designated hitter-free, just ask Greg Brown.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> There is not a single good argument against the DH. Every argument people make against it boils down to&nbsp;“That’s how we have always done it.” The DH is used at every level of baseball and in just about every league except the National League. Pitchers can’t hit, and nobody works on bunting anymore. They should just focus on pitching. It will make for a better game. It also will prevent pitchers from getting hit by pitches and running bases and lessen their chances of injury.</p>
<p><strong>Jose:</strong> Why do people still hold on to the hope that there will be sports this year? The COVID-19 numbers are rising, not declining, and players keep testing positive across all sports. I don’t see how any of these team sports can happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I guess because the leagues are all planning on playing? We all have to learn how to live in a world with the coronavirus. It isn’t going anywhere. Sports are no different. They are trying to figure out the best way to do it. I don’t know about college football, but I believe we will see everything else.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> With Chris Archer on the shelf, is Trevor Williams a lock to pitch the opener? Also, will Keone Kela be on the team by the end of the season?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I would think so, but Joe Musgrove might have something to say about that. Williams now should be the staff ace, but Musgrove was their best pitcher statistically last year. And he seems to be poised to have a breakout season.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ken:</strong>&nbsp;Why do the Pirates have such bad luck developing a lot of the first rounders? Remember John Van Benshotten, the position player they tried to turn into a pitcher?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> You mean Stetson Allie? Yeah whatever happened to him. Gerrit Cole turned out OK, and Jameson Taillon has been riddled with injuries/illnes,s but he has been good when he has been healthy. But overall, yes, the Pirates’ history of drafting pitchers in the first round is ugly. Hopefully this new regime gets it right.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Why won’t the media admit they were fooled by the noose hoax? The media created a story, shamed all white people who like NASCAR and then just moved on and acted like we are supposed to forget this. Are you man enough to admit you were duped?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Given the climate we are in, a story like that was bound to go viral. It could have been avoided had NASCAR done some cursory checking around before going public, but it didn’t and the damage is done. That being said, I don’t think this was some hoax or some attempt at deception. It was a lesson in waiting until the facts come out to make accusations and/or judgment about something. I am glad it wasn’t a hate crime, though, because it at least removes that ugliness. But if it makes you feel better, I was duped.</p>
