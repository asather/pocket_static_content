<h1>Walkabout: No fanfare for David Lewis, an uncommon man</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>David Lewis had a laugh that burst out of him like a playful creature that romped a bit before trailing off in a gleeful giggle.</p>
<p>My former colleague, MacKenzie Carpenter, who wrote a remarkable profile of him in 2012, on his 90th birthday, described it as “a wild cackle, loud and giddy.”&nbsp;It was an audible symbol of the generosity of the man, compatible with an uncontainable intellect and spirit.</p>
<p>When Mr. Lewis died in his sleep on June 30 at age 98, word spread like a force of nature throughout an enormous community of architects, urban planners and designers, artists, community activists, community development professionals, policy makers, people at foundations, journalists and probably not a few people who as children remember the big man who got down on the floor to consult with them on what they wanted their city to be.</p>
<p>He was a native South African whose activism against apartheid got him exiled. He studied architecture at the University of Leeds in England and came to Pittsburgh in 1962 as a visiting scholar at Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>He was a professor of architecture and urban design there when he co-founded Urban Design Associates, a pioneering firm of architects who consulted with the public to design buildings to solve social problems. That focus was revolutionary in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>When I got an email from Rob Stephany, a senior program director of the Heinz Endowments, informing me of his passing, I immediately began contacting people to talk about his legacy.</p>
<p>I asked Rob to guide me to people, and he wrote back, “I’m overwhelmed at the math right now. He’s touched so many folks with his work and teaching, and changed how all of those folks work and teach. I’m proud to be one of them.”</p>
<p>I asked his daughter, An Lewis, if she would be part of an appreciation story, and she pulled the reins. To respect her father’s wishes that there be no plaudits or fanfare, she asked me to reconsider.</p>
<p>“I want to stand on the rooftops and tell people who he was, but he would be devastated if I did that,” she said. “He is very modest and humble.”</p>
<p>So this is my personal appreciation. I can’t improve on <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/home/2012/01/24/David-Lewis-An-Urban-Legend/stories/201201240268" target="_blank">MacKenzie’s 2012 profile</a>, which contains&nbsp;all the things that made him such an incontrovertible agent of change.</p>
<p>There’s also this video of him discussing his work.</p>

<p>Patricia Lowry, who wrote exquisitely about architecture during her long tenure at The Pittsburgh Press and Post-Gazette, introduced me to Mr. Lewis, probably 15 years ago. I covered the neighborhood beat and he would write me letters urging me on.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods and their organic identities were among his passions. He helped me see neighborhoods as places that belonged to the people who lived in them. He encouraged me to do more when I reported on places that had been neglected, where the built environment had been imposed on residents, removed from under them, or both. He talked about a city as a textile that is vulnerable as a whole if one part of it is fraying.</p>
<p>He talked about design and buildings as virtues of an ecosystem when done right, about architecture as a pursuit of culture and heritage, about buildings not as objects but as living pieces of society.</p>
<p>I treasure memories of having lunch in Homestead with him and his wife, Judy, on several occasions. Their home is in West Homestead.</p>
<p>He was always interested in my work, but he was unreserved in his curiosity about all the people he talked to, and genuine in his warmth. He would hold forth telling stories, often punctuated by that laugh.</p>
<p>David always ordered vegetarian meals, and one day I asked why he had decided not to eat meat.</p>
<p>“When I was in England, I had a window that looked out on an abattoir (slaughterhouse),” he said, fixing me with that look — part eagle, part elf. “I could never eat an animal again.”</p>
<p>Sometimes he would become so impassioned about the things he cared about that I would feel myself starting to tear up. Everything he said resonated so strongly.</p>
<p>It is easy for people who knew him to use terms about him that made him cringe —&nbsp;lion, giant, legend, renaissance man, among them. It was his humility, combined with passion and brilliance, that earned him such reverence. He gave credit to others, drew collaborators to him, sought feedback and educated so many who have turned urban design into a mainstream practice.</p>
<p>They were lining up to talk to me about him. They will surely be talking about him among themselves, as many are doing all over social media. The justness of his passion is a living thing in all of them, and it hangs in the air, still, like the energy in that boundless laugh.</p>
