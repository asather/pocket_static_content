<h1>Joe Starkey: Tom Brady’s accomplishments will never be matched (and don’t the Steelers know it)</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>He made it to the Super Bowl every other year, on average. We could probably end right there. We could meditate on that for a month.</p>
<p>Take away the two years Tom Brady appeared in only one game — once because he was a rookie, once because he was injured — and he played in the Super Bowl nine times in 18 years during his historically ridiculous run with the New England Patriots, which ended this week.</p>
<p>Four franchises (Browns, Lions, Jaguars, Texans) have never appeared in a Super Bowl. Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees and Dan Marino have been to three, combined. Ben Roethlisberger has been to three. Peyton Manning went to four.</p>
<p>Brady has been to <em>nine</em>.</p>
<p>That is crazy.</p>
<p>That is almost unfathomable.</p>
<p>And that might not even be the best way to illustrate the man’s dominance.</p>
<p>This might be: Brady presided over not one dynasty, but two. His teams won the Super Bowl three times in four years in the early 2000s and three times in five years from 2014-18.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme, Brady has delivered not one Hall of Fame career, but two — his first 10 years and his second 10. Brady I and Brady II. He should invite a clone of himself to his induction ceremony and have two presenters (one of them being Mr. Big Chest, of course, years after the Tampa Bay Buccaneers win it all on a pass from T.B. to A.B.).</p>
<p>Let’s break that down, and please consider that all the names you’re about to see in parentheses already are enshrined in Canton …</p>
<p>— In his first 10 years (2000-2009) — two of which he basically missed — Brady passed for 30,844 yards (more than Joe Namath or Ken Stabler) and 225 touchdowns (more than Terry Bradshaw or Kurt Warner), won three Super Bowls in four tries and twice was named Super Bowl MVP. Brady I would have been an easy Hall of Famer.</p>
<p>— In his next 10 years, Brady passed for 43,727 yards (more than Joe Montana or Jim Kelly) and 316 touchdowns (more than John Elway or Dan Fouts), won three Super Bowls in five tries and twice was was named Super Bowl MVP. Brady II would have been an easy <em>first</em>-<em>ballot</em> Hall of Famer.</p>
<p>The ultimate statistic: Brady has won more Super Bowls (six) than any man in NFL history. He is the all-time leader in the clubhouse, with at least one more chance to pile on, and I have a hard time believing anyone — even Patrick Mahomes — will come close to matching his resume.</p>
<p>The Steelers sure helped. Brady should thank them early in his induction speech. You might think it unfair to pick on them, saying, “Wait a second, Brady killed everyone.”</p>
<p>I would reply by saying, “Not the way he killed the Steelers.”</p>
<p>Of any opponent Brady has played eight or more times, he has his highest completion percentage (68.8 percent), passer rating (111.0) and yards per game (312) against the Steelers. His offense rang up the most points (55) and yards (610) ever registered against a Steelers defense in a 55-31 rout in 2013.</p>
<p>And that’s just in the regular season, during which Brady is 9-3 against the Steelers. In home games against them, he is 6-0 with 21 touchdowns and no interceptions. The one time he missed a home game against the Steelers, they ransacked Matt Cassel for five sacks and two interceptions in a 33-10 victory.</p>
<p>In the playoffs, Brady is 3-0 against the Steelers — all with a trip to the Super Bowl at stake. Imagine how different the story might be for Brady and Ben Roethlisberger if the last two games go the other way.</p>
<p>This is also where it gets complicated, if you believe the Patriots’ cheating ways of the early 2000s helped them (I sure do). Spygate was real. Deflategate, however, was fake. So even if Brady I is somewhat tarnished (we’ll never know how much), Brady II is not.</p>
<p>I remember then-Steelers secondary coach Ray Horton sharing with me his opinion of Brady three days after a lopsided loss to the Patriots in 2010.</p>
<p>“You can give me Peyton Manning, Drew Brees — you give me Tom Brady? I’m taking him,” Horton said. “In my opinion, he’s the best quarterback, hands down.”</p>
<p>Brady has always seemed to take particular pleasure in beating the Steelers, almost as if he identified them as the gold standard — and for a while they were, with more Super Bowl wins than anyone.</p>
<p>Now, it’s tied: Steelers 6, Brady 6.</p>
