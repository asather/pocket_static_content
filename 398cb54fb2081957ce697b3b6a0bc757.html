<p>As the Post-Gazette’s Joe Starkey <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2020/02/06/Joe-Starkey-Antonio-Brown-apology-steelers-the-fan-morning-show/stories/202002060163" target="_blank">pointed out last week</a>, Antonio Brown apologies tend not to have the longest shelf life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s noteworthy, then, that almost a week after his high-profile interview with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/06/antonio-brown-interview-937-the-fan-juju-smith-schuster-ben-roethlisberger/stories/202002060101" target="_blank">93.7 The Fan’s&nbsp;“Fan Morning Show,”</a> in which he apologized for at least some of the acrimony he caused during his exit from Pittsburgh a year ago, he’s sticking with his remorseful tone. The former Steelers receiver posted the following mea culpa to quarterback Ben Roethlisberger:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make of it what you will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brown also touched on his relationship with Roethlisberger last week, though the comments came toward the end of the interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Do I hate Ben? No. Do I love Ben? Yes,” Brown said. “Ben's a great guy. Great person. Great quarterback. All the disappointment and frustration we had could have been hashed out. But when guys' emotions and egos get involved, a lot of stuff goes different ways.”</p>
<p>Brown had previously lashed out at Roethlisberger numerous times publicly, accusing him of having an&nbsp;“owner’s mentality” and telling him to&nbsp;“shut up” when Roethlisberger apologized for comments on a radio show that angered Brown during the 2018 season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Brown continued to trade barbs with YouTuber Logan Paul. The two have openly discussed fighting each other in a boxing match, and last week, Paul dropped a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZCc-StOrvU" target="_blank">diss track</a> poking fun at his prospective opponent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brown responded via Instagram, telling Paul simply,&nbsp;“If you wanna fight, let’s just fight.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned.&nbsp;</p>
