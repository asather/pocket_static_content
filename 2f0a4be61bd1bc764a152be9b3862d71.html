<h1>Paul Zeise: Starling Marte should be the first of veterans the Pirates trade</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There are news reports that trade talks involving Starling Marte have begun to&nbsp;“heat up” (whatever that means) and that the Mets and Padres are among the top suitors for his services. Marte is the Pirates’ best player, so if you remove him from the equation, there is almost no question they will finish in last place in the National League Central for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>That’s great news in my opinion. Not that the Pirates will finish in last place, but that they are removing any doubt about what their intentions are moving forward. If they trade Marte, they are in full rebuild mode, and that’s the right approach to take.</p>
<p>But they can’t do it halfway. They can’t worry about this season at all. This is the one year the new management team has a free pass. They need to use that pass wisely and strip down the roster, creating room for their youngest and brightest players to play.</p>
<p>The farm system is barren right now and needs to be restocked. They need more prospects, and they need more hope for the future. There are some bright spots in the farm system and among their youngest players, but not nearly enough to feel like happy days are right around the corner.</p>
<p>The Pirates have only three of the Baseball America Top 100 prospects, and none in the top 50. Mitch Keller is No. 52 and he is joined on the top 100 list by Ke’Bryan Hayes and ONeil Cruz. That’s it. That is the total list of top 100 prospects in the Pirates system. That doesn’t mean there aren’t other players in the system that will have an impact at some point; it means the system is not loaded with top-end talent.</p>
<p>Hayes is supposed to be the third baseman of the future, but that future should start this year. They have Colin Moran to keep the seat warm in the meantime, but it is a bad sign if Hayes isn’t the everyday third baseman by midseason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cole Tucker hasn’t shown he is fully ready to hit consistently at the this level, but he is an excellent fielder so the hope is he wins the shortstop position and never let’s go. Cruz is a shortstop/third baseman and with Kevin Newman also in the picture, it would seem he could be a replacement for Gregory Polanco in right field or a piece to trade for pitching prospects.</p>
<p>Adam Frazier is a nice utility player, but he doesn’t seem to have a place in the everyday lineup. Maybe Chris Archer can increase his value with a few good starts early in the season, but he is a player that should not be on this team after the trade deadline regardless. The same can be said about Keone Kela.</p>
<p>Josh Bell needs to be signed or traded, and it is that simple. The Pirates either need to commit long term to Bell as their first baseman or trade him now while he still has some controllable years. The Pirates probably waited too long to trade Andrew McCutchen but got lucky that Bryan Reynolds has turned into something they never imagined he’d be.</p>
<p>Bell is a free agent after 2022, so he would be on the market next year at the trade deadline because they Pirates won’t be able to afford him. His value isn’t likely to increase significantly between now and then, so the Pirates should be shopping him hard. There is no reason to keep him around this year seeing as rebuilding, not winning, is the goal.</p>
<p>That is, of course, unless Bob Nutting and company want to prove they are truly interested in operating differently and offer Bell a long-term deal. That would mean tying a lot of money up in Bell and making him their unquestioned first baseman for the long haul. That doesn’t seem likely. I would do it, but I don’t write the checks and this is not the way that Nutting has operated to this point.</p>
<p>I don’t think Polanco is going to have value on the trade market right now. But the Pirates should hope he has a really good — and healthy — months so maybe they can trade him at the deadline, too.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fans will accept a team that only wins 65 games if there seems to be a purpose and a light at the end of the tunnel. Fans would actually much rather see that than that has just enough veteran talent to slop together 78 wins.</p>
<p>Mediocrity is not a good thing for the Pirates right now because it will just mean more of the same. They need to go big or go home when it comes to rebuilding. Marte is a good start, but let’s hope it is exactly that — a start.</p>
