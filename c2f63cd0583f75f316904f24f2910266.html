<h1>Pitt secures verbal commitments from 2021 QB Nate Yarnell, OL Marco Fugar</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt snagged the latest talent from Texas' top quarterback factory and someone who might block for him one day.</p>
<p>Three-star signal-caller Nate Yarnell — a burgeoning star at Lake Travis High School, previous home of Baker Mayfield and more college success stories — verbally committed to Pitt's 2021 class on Thursday night, followed by two-star St. Thomas Aquinas (Florida) guard Marco Fugar.</p>
<p>Yarnell is the first quarterback of the class, while Fugar is the second offensive lineman, linking up with three-star tackle Terrence Rankl, who committed last week.</p>
<p>Fugar and Yarnell bring Pitt's 2021 class to nine total members and, more importantly, offer depth up front and a signal-caller early in the cycle, respectively. Despite bringing in Arizona State transfer Joey Yellen, Pitt did not sign a quarterback in the 2020 cycle, so Yarnell's commitment is significant.</p>
<p>Yarnell — who had offers from Houston, Utah, Nevada and others — should see his stock rise as a senior. The 6-6 passer started only six games as a junior, but threw for 1,489 yards and 14 touchdowns in an undefeated run with Lake Travis. The 200-pounder came off the bench to replace the injured Hudson Card, a four-star, 2020 Texas signee and the latest in a long line of Lake Travis standouts.</p>
<p>Todd Reesing, who led Kansas to a 12-1 record and Orange Bowl win in 2007, started the Lake Travis trend. Cleveland Browns backup quarterback Garrett Gilbert earned the 2008 Gatorade Player of the Year and captured a state title before playing at Texas. Mayfield threw for 45 touchdowns as a senior at Lake Travis, a footnote in his circuitous route to becoming the No. 1 overall pick in 2018.</p>
<p>Michael Brewer, a starter at Virginia Tech in 2014 and 2015, greased the wheels before his brother, Charlie, took over. The younger Brewer, Baylor's stud quarterback, is a dark horse candidate for the 2020 Heisman Trophy.</p>
<p>Yarnell, if he signs with Pitt come the winter, should have the opportunity to throw it around in offensive coordinator Mark Whipple's system, giving him a chance to put up numbers. Whipple's 2019 offense lacked efficiency (94th in overall passer rating), but boasted volume, throwing the ball 513 times (eighth-most nationally).</p>
<p>That ought to give Fugar — a 6-3, 275-pound guard with offers from Maryland, Colorado State, Appalachian State and Coastal Carolina — an incentive to fine tune his pass protection skills over the next year before joining Pitt. It also should give Yarnell something to look forward to, even if he has to apply the same patience he did at Lake Travis last year.</p>
<p>With Kenny Pickett out of eligibility following the 2020 season, Yellen, current redshirt freshman Davis Beville and redshirt sophomore Nick Patti are expected to compete for the 2021 starting job. Still, Pitt might have secured its quarterback of the (distant) future in Yarnell on Thursday night.</p>
