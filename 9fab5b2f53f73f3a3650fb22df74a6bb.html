<h1>A treacherous journey: Christian Moore-Rouse's last ride ended in death, five-month mystery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On March 5 an eerie post appeared on Christian Moore-Rouse’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>“His close friends warned him in no uncertain terms to stay away from that weirdo Adam Rosenberg,” the post said, “but Christian being Christian thought it was Okay [sic] to be his friend.”</p>
<p>By then, Christian Moore-Rouse had been dead for months after being shot in the head, and Mr. Rosenberg sat in a jail cell, charged with killing Jeremy Dentel, a 28-year-old Baldwin Borough resident, after the two connected through a gay dating app.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore-Rouse’s sister had accessed his Facebook page to let everyone know about her brother and her suspicions about his death. For months she and the rest of their family awaited word on whether Mr. Rosenberg — or anyone — would be charged with her brother’s killing. They and Mr. Moore-Rouse’s friends grew frustrated with police.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, their wait ended. Police charged Mr. Rosenberg with homicide, abuse of a corpse, robbery and tampering with evidence in Mr. Moore-Rouse’s death.</p>
<p>Detectives accused Mr. Rosenberg of luring Mr. Rouse-Moore to his Fox Chapel house on a pretense, sending an Uber for him and then shooting him in the back of his head. Police said Mr. Rosenberg dragged the body down his driveway and into a ditch, where he left it to molder throughout the winter.</p>
<p>Investigators discovered Mr. Moore-Rouse’s remains March 3 while executing a search warrant on a wooded plot of largely inaccessible land in Fox Chapel across from Mr. Rosenberg’s home on Settlers Ridge Road. They were&nbsp;clad in the off-white fleece Champion shirt, yellow T-shirt, two pairs of athletic pants, a blue neck warmer and a light blue jacket that Mr. Moore-Rouse had last been seen wearing on a Port Authority bus in December, The 22-year-old’s body was in such bad shape, said Randall McKinney, a lawyer for the Rouse family, that the remains had to be cremated.</p>
<p>The parcel, smaller than an acre, is owned by the Fox Chapel Area Land Trust. The only way to get to it is to traverse private property. Only a handful of property owners have land abutting the site, with one of them being the Rosenberg family, proprietors of a small but venerable regional grocery store chain called Community Super Market.</p>
<p>“The remains were not buried, but it would have been not the easiest thing to see,” Fox Chapel police Chief David Laux said. “You would have had to have known exactly where to look and even then it would have been hard to see. We were acting on information pursuant to the investigation.”</p>
<p>In the charging documents, police said that an unnamed person identified as Witness #3 told them Feb. 19 that there might be a body in the woods near Mr. Rosenberg’s house. Witness #3 told detectives that Mr. Rosenberg had been making all kinds of wild claims.</p>
<p>“Witness #3 heard Rosenberg make numerous comments&nbsp;about ‘catching a body’ and referenced killing someone and putting their body in the woods by his (Rosenberg’s) house,” the complaint said.&nbsp;“Witness&nbsp;#3 could not recall the person’s name in the interview, but Rosenberg referred to him as someone who ripped him (Rosenberg) off a&nbsp;while back.”</p>
<p>As the interview wrapped up, police told the witness that Mr. Rosenberg had been charged with Mr. Dentel’s death. The witness&nbsp;“suggested that police check around Rosenberg’s house because everything he (Rosenberg)&nbsp;said ‘might be true.’</p>
<p><strong>‘Crazy A’</strong></p>
<p>A week later, Mr. Moore-Rouse’s mother gave police access to her son’s cell phone and texts between him and someone named&nbsp;“Crazy A.” The exchange took place on the day Mr. Moore-Rouse disappeared and dealt with how Mr. Moore-Rouse got to Fox Chapel — by an Uber called by the accused killer.</p>
<p>For months,&nbsp;Mr. Moore-Rouse’s friends and family felt certain about the chain of events that led their loved one from Verona to his death in Fox Chapel —&nbsp;and according to the criminal complaint, they were right.</p>
<p>Police relied on three witnesses and information from Mr. Rosenberg’s cell phone to put their case together.</p>
<p>Although the official police account lists Mr. Moore-Rouse’s last known whereabouts on Dec. 21 at the Penn Hills Dollar Tree store on Rodi Road where he worked — he was scheduled for an 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift that day but started and left late, according to Allegheny County Police Superintendent Coleman McDonough — his friend Allan Littlejohn Jr. said they did a video chat with each other as Mr. Moore-Rouse got into a car on Spruce Street in Verona, where his step-father lived.</p>
<p>It was an Uber, according to Mr. Littlejohn. It was the last time anyone besides his killer would see Mr. Moore-Rouse alive.</p>
<p>Mr. McKinney said Mr. Rosenberg had invited Mr. Moore-Rouse to smoke marijuana together.</p>
<p>“[Mr. Moore-Rouse’s mother] has text messages between Christian and Rosenberg on the day in question,” Mr. McKinney said, “and that is the nature of the conversation — there’s an overture by Rosenberg to Christian to come smoke marijuana.”</p>
<p>There were other overtures, according to Mr. McKinney. T. Lee Rouse, Mr. Moore-Rouse’s mother, said she confronted Mr. Rosenberg by phone on Dec. 28, a week after her son vanished, about what she called “gay advances.” He told her that he joked that way with straight men, she said.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t what troubled her most about Mr. Rosenberg, a 21-year-old product of Fox Chapel prone to erratic outbursts and who suffered, according to a police report, from bipolar disorder. At some point, the former youth hockey player had uttered something about killing his own parents, according to Mr. Littlejohn.</p>
<p>“The name Adam, his phone, and address were given to Verona and ... Allegheny County police as soon as we got it along with a disturbing statement Adam made,” according to a written account by Ms. Rouse of her search efforts. “The [Rouse] family stated, ‘If he told Christian that he wanted to kill his parents, he would kill anybody.’ Please go talk to Adam.”</p>
<p>The criminal complaint refers to Witness #1, a friend of Mr. Moore-Rouse’s, who had misgivings about Mr. Rosenberg.</p>
<p>“Witness #1&nbsp;said that Rosenberg was very weird and often going on about ‘serial killer stuff’ and always making comments about wanting to&nbsp;have sex with Christian. This prompted Witness #1 to distance himself/herself from Rosenberg, but Christian continued to spend&nbsp;time with Rosenberg. Witness #1 stated that Rosenberg would give Christian drugs and money and would often send rideshares&nbsp;such as Uber or Lyft to bring Christian to Rosenberg’s house. Witness #1 said that Christian would not normally tell him/her when&nbsp;he was going to Rosenberg’s house because he knew Witness #1 did not agree with Christian remaining friends with Rosenberg,” the complaint said.</p>
<p>Police said that on Nov. 25, Mr. Rosenberg texted someone: “ ‘Can’t get into it over here it’s violent but fr I was gonna kill my parents’&nbsp; followed by ‘Chris was supposed to hand me&nbsp;the shovel but he tweaked kind of that’s what makes me so mad!!!’&nbsp;“</p>
<p>During one phone call between Mr. Rosenberg and his alleged victim,&nbsp;“Christian put the call on speaker phone for Witness #1 to hear. In that call, Rosenberg was heard asking Christian to kill his&nbsp;parents for him. Christian said he would not do that. Witness #1 told [police] that he/she was suspicious of&nbsp;Rosenberg’s involvement in Christian’s disappearance, which prompted Witness #1 to contact Rosenberg to find out what when he&nbsp;last saw Christian. Witness #1 stated that as soon as Christian went missing, he/she suspected that Rosenberg was involved,” the complaint said.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Rosenberg’s attorneys, Casey White, addressed the comments about Mr. Rosenberg’s parents.</p>
<p>“Mr. Adam Rosenberg loves both of his parents and is appreciative of their continued support through this difficult time,” Mr. White said in March. “Mr. and Mrs. Rosenberg stand behind their son and the entire extended Rosenberg family remains close knit and united.”</p>
<p>Whatever Mr. Rosenberg said, the allure of marijuana would have been a powerful draw for Mr. Moore-Rouse.</p>
<p>“Christian danced to his own beat, he loved his family, friends and Marajuana [sic],” his sister’s Facebook post said. ”He thought he was a WEED CONNOISSUER [sic] and at the time of this tragedy was actively seeking a career as a weed critic. Yes he loved the bud, LOL, he said it was his passion.”</p>
<p>But there was far more to Mr. Moore-Rouse, his family and friends said. He volunteered at Mulberry Community Church, Jubilee Soup Kitchen and the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. He also played golf and wanted to start his own business. Mr. Moore-Rouse grew up in Shadyside, graduating from Taylor Allderdice High School.</p>
<p>“He was trying to find his way and maybe was a little misguided in trying to find what his path would be,” Mr. McKinney said. “It appears to me that his love for people and his willingness to trust others unfortunately is what led to his downfall.”</p>
<p><strong>Acquaintances</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Moore-Rouse, Mr. Littlejohn and Mr. Rosenberg became acquainted through the Community College of Allegheny County, where they all attended at one time. Mr. Moore-Rouse studied heating, ventilation and air conditioning. Mr. Rosenberg studied music.</p>
<p>In the week leading up to his disappearance, Mr. Moore-Rouse stayed in a home on Merwyn Street in Pittsburgh’s Sheraden neighborhood shared by Mr. Littlejohn and his roommate, Ray McCarthy.</p>
<p>A month or so earlier, Mr. Moore-Rouse had been behind the wheel of his girlfriend’s car when he got into an accident, according to Mr. McCarthy. He was concerned about the ramifications and stayed away from his family, Mr. McCarthy said.</p>
<p>By Friday, Dec. 20, he was ready to leave Sheraden. The next day, according to his family, he visited his step-father, Lloyd Oliver, at his home on Spruce Street in Verona. And then he got into the vehicle — believed by his friends to be an Uber — and disappeared.</p>
<p>One thing that disappeared with him: a Ruger handgun he was said to carry.</p>
<p>As the days passed with no word, the family’s anxiety mounted.</p>
<p>On Dec. 22, his mother, Ms. Rouse, tried to reach him, but the call went straight to voicemail. When Mr. Moore-Rouse didn’t show up to meet her as planned the next day, she grew worried. She talked to Mr. Littlejohn, who told her that her son got into a car with a white man. When Mr. Moore-Rouse didn’t show up for Christmas, Mr. Oliver went to the Verona police station on Christmas Day and talked to Chief Ron McLemore.</p>
<p>Ms. Rouse said she suspected foul play immediately. But at first, the chief wasn’t overly concerned.</p>
<p>Despite Mr. Moore-Rouse’s marijuana habit, Chief McLemore said he did not believe the missing man had overdosed on anything. There were no signs that he was spending money. And Mr. Moore-Rouse was an adult, the chief noted, fully within his rights to stay away from his family.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Chief McLemore said he entered Mr. Moore-Rouse’s details into the database maintained by the National Crime Information Center, an electronic clearinghouse open to all law enforcement agencies. He said he distributed pictures of Mr. Moore-Rouse to his handful of officers and watched as missing signs sprouted on utility poles in the borough, put up by family members.</p>
<p>The chief said that Mr. Moore-Rouse’s mother did not mention anyone named Adam — something Ms. Rouse disputes.</p>
<p>But Chief McLemore confirmed that she did mention a friend of her son’s named Allan — likely Mr. Littlejohn. The chief spoke with Allan and said that he didn’t say the name “Adam” either. But, the chief said, Allan did say that Mr. Moore-Rouse had told him during their video call, “I’m getting ready to get in a car with a white guy.”</p>
<p>Allan, the chief recalled, “seemed like a nice guy. Seemed like he didn’t know anything.”</p>
<p>The criminal complaint says Witness #1 had a FaceTime call with Mr. Moore-Rouse the night he disappeared. Mr. Moore-Rouse didn’t have a coat on and was in what the witness presumed to be an Uber.</p>
<p>It was a dark red Ford C-Max. The driver dropped him off on Settlers Ridge Road in Fox Chapel at 7:20 p.m. on Dec. 21. The driver told police that another man came down the driveway to meet his passenger.</p>
<p><strong>‘Something’s got to be up’</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile Ms. Rouse had started digging. She put together a list of her son’s white friends, assuming that the driver was one of them. She checked various Snapchat accounts. She called people he knew. As she poked around, she kept hearing things about Mr. Rosenberg that gave her pause.</p>
<p>By Jan. 4, Ms. Rouse was running out of patience. She showed up at the Verona police station with Mr. Oliver. It was then that the chief realized there was a serious problem.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking, ‘Jesus, nobody’s heard from this kid, something’s got to be up,’ “ the chief recalled. “We knew he wasn’t in town.”</p>
<p>A day later, Ms. Rouse rallied family and friends to canvas parts of Pittsburgh, Verona and Green Tree.</p>
<p>And on Jan. 6, Chief McLemore called in the Allegheny County Police Department, which has vastly greater resources than his small force, and Pittsburgh police, because Mr. Littlejohn lived in the city.</p>
<p>In early January — it is not clear what date — investigators acknowledge that they were made aware of a friend of Mr. Moore-Rouse’s named Adam and were given his phone number. County police insist, however, that they were not provided with his last name or with any suspicions among friends and family that Mr. Rosenberg might have something to do with the disappearance.</p>
<p>Instead, police grew interested in Mr. Littlejohn. They “believed Littlejohn could provide insight into Christian’s location,” Superintendent McDonough said.</p>
<p>Mr. Littlejohn and Mr. McCarthy claim that they shared their suspicions with police. They also said they felt that police were harassing them, coming to their house several times and watching the premises.</p>
<p>“We told the detectives he was at Adam’s last, and they just blew us off,” Mr. McCarthy said. “We’ve been telling the detectives the whole time, if he’s not at his house, he’s somewhere near it.”</p>
<p>Superintendent McDonough said that information was never relayed to investigators on the missing persons case.</p>
<p>In January, Mr. McCarthy said his roommate told him, “I think Adam killed Christian.” Mr. McCarthy asked, “Why do you say that?’”</p>
<p>“Christian was supposed to help Adam kill his parents,” Mr. McCarthy said his roommate responded.</p>
<p>On Jan. 7, Ms. Rouse said, she had a long talk with a county homicide detective.</p>
<p>“Check out Adam,” she said she told him. “He told Christian [he] wanted to kill his parents. Anyone who could want to kill [their] parents could kill anybody.”</p>
<p>Two weeks before Mr. Moore-Rouse was found, police charged Mr. Rosenberg with killing Jeremy Dentel. According to police, the two men met online and arranged to get together at Mr. Dentel’s house. Video surveillance shows Mr. Rosenberg entering the house Feb. 15 and then leaving less than a minute later, police said. In that brief space, according to a criminal complaint, Mr. Rosenberg shot Mr. Dentel in the head.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg faced charges in several incidents last year involving various police departments including UPMC, Duquesne University, Ross, Harmar, Hampton and O’Hara.</p>
<p>On April 8, 2019, police were called to Ross Park Mall after security caught Mr. Rosenberg stealing merchandise from several stores and acting erratically, according to a police report. During that incident, Mr. Rosenberg was seen entering the stores while soaking wet and went in and out of changing rooms multiple times in different states of undress, one time coming out wearing only his underwear, the report said.</p>
<p>Police said they found a marijuana cigarette in Mr. Rosenberg’s clothing. While in a holding cell at the police station, Mr. Rosenberg dipped his head into the toilet numerous times and drank from it, police said. He pleaded guilty to retail theft and disorderly conduct.</p>
<p>On July 21, Mr. Rosenberg was cited for slapping a woman in the face at Patron Mexican Grill in O’Hara. The woman, a supervisor at the restaurant, called the incident “traumatic” and declined to discuss it. He was found guilty.</p>
<p>Eight days later, he was accused of striking someone in the face, knocking their glasses off, and then hitting them in the arm at UPMC Western Psychiatric Hospital. He was found not guilty of harassment.</p>
<p>On May 16, 2019, police said Mr. Rosenberg showed up impaired to a Hampton car wash where he had once worked. There they found Mr. Rosenberg, who failed field sobriety tests, according to a police report. Police said they found a bag of marijuana and an apple bong in his car and amphetamines on Mr. Rosenberg. In January, charged with two DUI counts, he entered the county’s Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition program for first-time, non-violent offenders.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg’s mother, Kimberly Rosenberg, told police after the incident that her son was enrolled at an intensive outpatient treatment program at the time and was prescribed lithium for his bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>On March 13, Mr. Rosenberg was held for trial in Mr. Dentel’s death. There was no mention of the Moore-Rouse case during the hearing.</p>
<p>“He wasn't perfect by any means but he always saw the good in everyone black, white, straight, gay, disabled, or mentally challenged, he did not care, he accepted you as you were,” Mr. Moore-Rouse’s sister wrote on Facebook. “To Christian people were people, we're all GOD'S children and he truly believed that he treated everyone accordingly with respect. It hurts me to say this but his fairness and creed of acceptance is the very quality that became his downfall.”</p>
<p>On May 7, police met once again with Witness #3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Witness #3 told detectives that Rosenberg told him/her about a person named Christian that ‘set him up to be robbed.’ Rosenberg indicated that he was going to do ‘something’ to Christian for setting him up,” the complaint said, “but then told Witness #3 he was ‘just kidding.’</p>
<p>“Witness #3 recalled that Adam Rosenberg told him/her about this plan to meet up with Christian while they were together in person, and the plan was for Rosenberg to meet Christian either that same day or the next day. Rosenberg said that he planned to meet up with Christian to play video games and smoke weed.”</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg told the witness about the Uber ride, according to the complaint. The final moments of Mr. Moore-Rouse’s life are described in chilling detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Rosenberg told Witness #3 that once Christian got out of the Uber,&nbsp;Rosenberg and Christian talked and walked away from the Uber, with Christian walking in front of Rosenberg. Rosenberg told&nbsp;Witness #3 that he pretended to be on his phone until the Uber driver turned around and disappeared down the road. Rosenberg&nbsp;said that once the Uber driver was gone, he shot Christian in the back of the head.</p>
<p>“Rosenberg told Witness #3 that he dragged&nbsp;the body down the driveway, left it in a ditch and just ‘left it there.’ Rosenberg disclosed that he did a ‘bad job’ because he did&nbsp;not cover the body and someone would be able to see it. Rosenberg told Witness #3 that he took Christian’s cell phone and&nbsp;backpack.</p>
<p>“Witness #3 stated that when Rosenberg told him/her this, he/she did not believe him.</p>
