<h1>U.S. source: Kim Jong Un in grave danger after surgery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The U.S. is monitoring intelligence that North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, is in grave danger after a surgery, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge.</p>
<p>South Korea’s presidential office said in response to the report that no suspicious activities have been detected in the North, though the presidential Blue House said it couldn’t confirm Mr. Kim’s current health.</p>
<p>“We have no information to confirm regarding rumors about Chairman Kim Jong Un’s health issue that have been reported by some media outlets. Also, no unusual developments have been detected inside North Korea,” Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok said in the statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Kim missed the celebration of his grandfather's birthday Wednesday, which raised speculation about his well-being. He had been seen four days before that at a government meeting.</p>
<p>A second U.S. official told CNN on Monday that the concerns about Mr. Kim's health are credible, but the severity of his condition is hard to assess.</p>
<p>Daily NK, an online newspaper based in South Korea that focuses on North Korea, reported that Mr. Kim underwent a cardiovascular system procedure on April 12 because of "excessive smoking, obesity, and overwork." The site reported he is now receiving treatment in a villa in Hyangsan County following his procedure.</p>

<p>After assessing that Mr. Kim's condition has improved, part of the medical team treating him returned to Pyongyang on April 19 and a few of them remained to oversee his recovery situation, according to Daily NK. CNN is unable to independently confirm the report.</p>
<p>A political upheaval in North Korea would be unlikely even if Mr. Kim became sidelined by health problems, according to analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at South Korea’s private Sejong Institute.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheong said Mr. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, is already exercising significant influence within the government and that most members of Pyongyang’s leadership share an interest with the Kim family in maintaining the North’s system.</p>
<p>The Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, also told the AP it couldn’t confirm the Daily NK report. The Daily NK is part of a group of nonprofit agencies affiliated with the Unification Ministry, and it has occasionally been contacted by Seoul officials for information.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Security Council and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment when reached by CNN on Monday. CNN has also reached out to the CIA and the State Department for comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gathering intelligence out of North Korea is notoriously difficult — one of the most challenging targets for U.S. intelligence.</p>
<p>North Korea tightly controls any information surrounding its leader, who is treated almost like a deity within the country. His absences from official state media often spark speculation and rumors about his health. North Korea has no free press and is often a black hole when it comes to the country's leadership. Analysts are heavily reliant on scanning state media dispatches and watching propaganda videos for any semblance of a clue.</p>
<p>Mr. Kim, 36 and a heavy smoker, has been shown in state media in recent months appearing at military drills and riding a white horse on the country’s revered Mount Paektu, where state propaganda says his grandfather used as a guerrilla base to fight Japanese colonial occupiers.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kim last appeared in North Korean state media April 11. April 15 — North Korea's most important holiday, the anniversary of the birth of the country's founding father, Kim Il Sung — came and went Wednesday without any official mention of Kim Jong Un's movements.</p>
<p>Experts are unsure of what to make of Mr. Kim's absence from any festivities celebrating his grandfather. When North Korean leaders have not shown up to these important celebrations in the past, it has portended major developments. But it has also turned out to be nothing.</p>
<p>"There have been a number of recent rumors about Kim's health (smoking, heart, and brain). If Kim is hospitalized, it would explain why he wasn't present on the important April 15 celebrations," said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former CIA deputy division chief for North Korea. "But over the years, there have been a number of false health rumors about Kim Jong Un or his father. We'll have to wait and see."</p>
<p>Kim Jong Il's absence from a parade celebrating North Korea's 60th anniversary in 2008 was followed by rumblings that he was in poor health. It was later revealed he had a stroke, after which his health continued to decline until his death in 2011.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un disappeared from the public eye for more than a month in 2014, which also prompted speculation about his health. He returned sporting a cane, and days later, South Korean intelligence said that he had a cyst removed from his ankle.</p>
<p>"It's easy to be wrong on this one," said John Delury, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul.</p>
