<h1>State tells Shell it doesn't need a waiver to build natural gas power plant</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Several hundred furloughed employees are heading back to work at the Shell Chemical Appalachia cracker plant in Potter Township.</p>
<p>The sprawling construction project shut down in mid-March to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but was authorized to keep some workers onsite to disinfect common areas and perform emergency repairs. There are currently about 300 people working at the Beaver County project.</p>
<p>By next week, Shell will have about 500 people onsite after it received word from the state that its “repair, preservation, and maintenance” activities do not require a waiver from the business shutdown Gov. Tom Wolf ordered last month.</p>
<p>“We will be reviewing our staffing numbers week by week, while also meeting CDC and DOH guidelines,” Shell spokesman Michael Marr said.</p>
<p>Before COVID-19 shutdown Shell’s and nearly all other construction projects in the state, the Beaver County site had about 8,500 workers onsite.</p>
<p>Casey Smith, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, which reviewed Shell’s waiver, said Shell’s request to the state asked that it be allowed to continue construction of a cogeneration power plant.</p>
<p>The petrochemical complex that Shell is building involves an ethane cracker, three polyethylene units and the 250-megawatt natural gas-powered electricity plant intended to power operations at the other facilities.</p>
<p>“An exemption is not required for such activity insofar as it directly supports electrical power generation, transmission and distribution,” Ms. Smith said. The utility industry is considered an essential service and is not subject to the shutdown.</p>
<p>“The involved agencies will of course be closely monitoring Shell’s activities to ensure that they do not exceed the limited operations described in their exemption request,” Ms. Smith added.</p>
<p>Mr. Marr said the way the site is being reconfigured to comply with state and federal health guidelines limits the number of workers who can be called back in the near future.</p>
<p>To avoid busing from an offsite parking lot — many early concerns about conditions on the construction site involved tightly packed buses shuttling workers to the site — employees will be able to drive onto the site itself. Although according to a letter sent to employees of Lenzner Coach Lines, which runs the shuttles, there may still be a need for some transportation by bus between areas onsite.</p>
<p>Shell said all arriving employees will get temperature screenings and each will have a separate table for lunch in the tents.</p>
<p>“Our mission currently has not changed; there are no plans for the immediate future to ‘ramp up’ construction activities to the level seen before the construction pause announced on March 18,” Mr. Marr said.</p>
<p>The $6 billion construction project in Beaver County is the largest in the state and has received fevered attention from labor, economic development, environmental and citizens groups.</p>
<p>Beaver County has had 156 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 14 deaths from the disease, according to the latest data from the Pennsylvania Department of Health as of April 14.&nbsp;</p>
