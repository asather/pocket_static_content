<h1>White House considers winding down coronavirus task force in coming weeks, sources say</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Trump administration officials are telling members and staff of the coronavirus task force that the White House plans to wind down the operation in coming weeks despite growing evidence that the crisis is raging on.</span></p>
<p>It is not clear whether any other group might replace the task force. But its gradual demise, which officials said might never be formally announced, would only intensify the questions about whether the administration is adequately organized to address the complex, life-and-death decisions related to the virus and giving adequate voice to scientists and public health experts in making policy.</p>
<p>While the task force’s advice has sometimes been swept aside by President Donald Trump and its recommendations for criteria on reopening for business defied by a number of states, it has served as the closest thing the White House has for running a centralized response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>A top adviser to Vice President Mike Pence who has helped oversee the task force, Olivia Troye, has told senior officials involved in the task force to expect the group to wind down within weeks, a notice echoed by other top White House officials. While the task force met Tuesday at the White House, Monday’s meeting was canceled, and a Saturday session, a staple of recent months, was never held.</p>
<p>Trump has stopped linking his news briefings on the virus to the task force’s meetings and no longer routinely arrays task force members around him in his public appearances.</p>
<p>While the rate of new infections and deaths has been falling in New York, it has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-deaths-cases-united-states.html" rel="nofollow">continued to rise in much of the rest of the country</a>, and a number of projections suggest that deaths will remain at elevated levels for months to come and could increase as states ease their stay-at-home orders. One <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-death-toll.html" rel="nofollow">document circulating inside the administration</a> raised the possibility of a rise in coronavirus infections and deaths this month, reaching about 3,000 daily deaths on June 1 — nearly double the current level.</p>
<p>A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations, said the task force will be winding down as the White House moves toward Phase One of Trump’s plan to “open up” the country. The focus now will be on therapeutics, vaccine development and testing, the official said.</p>
<p>A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p>A group led by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been functioning as something of a shadow task force. That group is likely to continue working; among other issues, Kushner is said to be discussing a new role for someone to oversee development of therapeutic treatments.</p>
<p>From its start in January, the task force has been rived with divisions. The secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, has been criticized for excluding key administration officials and was ousted as the leader of the group, replaced by Pence in late February. Trump took over its public briefings, often turning them into 90-minute-to-two-hour moments to air grievances, praise his own handling of the crisis and offer up his own prescriptions.</p>
