<h1>Marinas, restrooms, other facilities reopening at some state parks</h1>

<p>Call it a S’mores moment.</p>
<p>As some COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, marinas, golf courses, and other facilities in some Pennsylvania parks and forests will be reopening over the next week under a directive issued by the state’s Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Saturday.</p>
<p>All nine marinas in state parks will reopen Friday or their typical annual start date. At least one restroom in day use areas in all parks will be available Friday as well.</p>
<p>In addition, facilities like offices and campgrounds in the 24 northwest and north-central counties that have entered the “yellow” phase of Gov. Tom Wolf’s color-coded plan for the state can reopen May 15.</p>
<p>The exception will be cabins, which will not be available until June 12 to allow park staff to clean them and prepare them for use.</p>
<p>“As staffing allows and with the appropriate protocols in place to ensure safety, we are working to reopen our state parks and forests so that Pennsylvanians can realize all of the benefits associated with being outdoors,” DCNR Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn said.</p>
<p>In counties outside of those in the yellow phase, including those in southwestern Pennsylvania, all park and forest facilities except marinas and one restroom in each day use area will stay closed.</p>
<p>However, visitors still will have access to trails, lakes, rivers, streams, forests, roads, and parking areas for recreation.</p>
<p>Public golf courses at Caledonia and Evansburg state parks and the Michaux State Forest reopened Friday.</p>
<p>Playgrounds, nature play areas, interpretive centers, amphitheaters, and group camping facilities statewide will stay closed indefinitely. Swimming beaches will be closed until June 6.</p>
<p>In the counties in the yellow phase, pavilions will be available to groups under 25. Picnic tables will be spread out as part of COVID-19 mitigation measures.</p>
<p>The state also is urging the public to limit campsites and cabins to members living in the same household.</p>
<p>To avoid exposure to the coronavirus and to protect others, DCNR is advising park users to wear masks; carry hand sanitizer and use it regularly; avoid touching the face, eyes, or nose; cover the nose and mouth when coughing; and not to hike or exercise in groups and to stay at least six feet apart.</p>
