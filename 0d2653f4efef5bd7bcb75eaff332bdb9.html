<h1>Pirates arbitration updates: Josh Bell headlines several early settlements</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates have avoided five arbitration cases already Friday, with the most notable being Josh Bell.</p>
<p>A year after making $587,000, Bell will receive a hefty raise by agreeing to a contract of $4.8 million for 2020.&nbsp;Industry projections had Bell making $5.9 million.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes after news of Bell’s signing broke, Michael Feliz agreed to a $1.1 million contract for 2020, the latest Pirates player to avoid arbitration. Not long after that, it trickled out that Trevor Williams and the Pirates avoided arbitration by agreeing to a $2.825 million deal this season.</p>
<p>In all of the cases, the Pirates were able to save money, a total of $2,010,000. Not too bad when you consider that neither side really wants to go to arbitration if they don’t have to.</p>
<p>The Pirates have three potential arbitration cases left: Adam Frazier, Joe Musgrove and Keone Kela.</p>
<p>It was somewhat surprising that Bell settled. Given the prolific season he had in 2019, and the fact that he’s represented by super agent Scott Boras, one would think that Bell would want to maximize those earnings.</p>
<p>However, there’s also something to be said for getting the process over with; if Bell produces the way he’s capable in 2020, a difference of $1.1 million will turn out to be extremely minimal. Relatively speaking, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Update 12:45 p.m.:</strong> The Pirates have settled with another Tommy John surgery-having pitcher — Chad Kuhl — this one for $840,000. Kuhl was projected to make $1.4 million via the arbitration process but lacked leverage considering he did not pitch in 2019.</p>
<p>Kuhl will be ready for the start of spring training. One of the bigger decisions the Pirates will have to make involves whether they use Kuhl as a starter or back-end reliever.</p>
<p><strong>Update 12:30:&nbsp;</strong>The Pirates crossed off one of their eight potential arbitration cases Friday by settling with Jameson Taillon for $2.25 million.</p>
<p>Taillon, who will miss 2020 because of a second Tommy John surgery, was projected to make $2.3 for the 2020 season via the arbitration process.</p>
<p>Several of these cases are expected to settle before reaching arbitration.</p>
<p>If arbitration becomes necessary, a three-person panel will look at figures submitted by both the player and team, choosing one or the other. If a player doesn’t settle before arbitration, he and the team can still negotiate a contract before the hearing.</p>
