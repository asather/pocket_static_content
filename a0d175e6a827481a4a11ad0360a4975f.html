<h1>Former Westinghouse and Duquesne big man James Ellis looking forward to fresh start in Florida</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just like he did when he was a standout at Westinghouse High School, James Ellis will be rocking a blue and yellow jersey this upcoming season.</p>
<p>“I’m well aware of that. Those might as well be my favorite colors,” Ellis said.</p>
<p>And just as he did at the ‘House, Ellis hopes his basketball talent will earn him a Division I scholarship.</p>
<p>But there’s one glaring difference — he won’t be playing close to home, and for this 6-foot-11 center, that could be a very good move.</p>
<p>Ellis, who grew up in Larimer in Pittsburgh’s East End and spent the past two seasons at Duquesne, is heading to Florida to play at Tallahassee Community College, which boasts one of the top junior college programs in the Sunshine State. He announced his commitment last Thursday, just hours after putting his name in the transfer portal.</p>
<p>“I love the fact that it’s away from home, and it gives me a fresh start and a chance to learn from my mistakes,” he said.</p>
<p>When Ellis enrolled at Duquesne in fall 2018, he was a sleeping giant, as in this athletic big man with an equally big smile was slept on in his recruitment. It looked like the Dukes had a diamond in the rough, but the marriage just didn’t work out. Ellis redshirted his first season, saying one of the biggest challenges was focusing on being a student.</p>
<p>“It’s class-first there, and it was hard for me in the classroom coming from Westinghouse,” said Ellis, a Post-Gazette Fabulous 5 pick his senior season when he averaged 21 points, 12 rebounds and 7 blocks per game. Ellis was the first Westinghouse graduate to play at Duquesne since the great Chuck Cooper.</p>
<p>Ellis envisioned having a breakout season this past winter, but ended up playing only five games and 11 minutes total. He said he at times clashed heads with coach Keith Dambrot and struggled with life off the court.</p>
<p>“The way I was told, I thought everything was going to be fine,” Ellis said about his mindset heading into the 2019-2020 season. “I’m not going to talk bad on Keith Dambrot, but in retrospect, what happened was I had high hopes and mistakes were made.”</p>
<p>So, Ellis decided to pursue a fresh start. It turned out he wasn’t in the transfer portal long. He said a slew of schools, from Division I to JUCO, reached out to him quickly. One of them was Tallahassee C.C. Ellis FaceTimed one of its coaches, and also got some advice from friend Daivon Stephens, a former star at Penn Hills who played at Tallahassee C.C. last season before committing to Division I Coastal Carolina in April. Stephens, too, began his college career at the Division I level, playing for Eastern Michigan.</p>
<p>“He told me it’s the best thing for me,” Ellis said. “It’s a long way from home, but it will help me get me out of my comfort zone.”</p>
<p>Another Ellis reached out to him, as well. El Ellis, who played at Tallahassee C.C. last season, committed to Louisville one day before coaches contacted James Ellis. El Ellis was considered one of the top JUCO players in the country.</p>
<p>This time next year, James Ellis wouldn’t mind having a similar designation.</p>
<p>“My goal is to make up for all the time I missed out on, and for all the mistakes I made,” he said. “I want to reach my fullest amount of potential in a short time, and show the world I’m still here.”</p>
<p><strong>Another Blue Hen</strong></p>
<p>Gateway defensive back Shane Thrift said he had a great relationship with Delaware coaches right from the get-go, and that their steady contact played a big part in him recently committing there. But there was one other factor, too.</p>
<p>“They’ve done well getting guys from Pittsburgh,” he said.</p>
<p>Thrift, who will be a senior this fall, is the latest WPIAL standout to commit to the Blue Hens. The program has reeled in some really good ones in recent years, including South Fayette’s Noah Plack, Steel Valley’s Amonte’ Strothers and Washington’s Daniel Walker. Plack was Delaware’s second-leading tackler last season as a redshirt freshman. Thrift and Strothers are friends.</p>
<p>Like many of those WPIAL players who chose Delaware, Thrift said he received interest from Power Five schools, but said he fits best at Delaware, an FCS school. Thrift said Delaware coaches like his versatility, as in he can play safety or cornerback, and even slot receiver.</p>
<p>Thrift’s brother, Brenon, recently graduated from West Virginia, where he played his final two college seasons. Brenon (6 feet 3, 290 pounds) is nicknamed “Baby Hulk.” Shane is smaller (6-0, 170) and faster, and has a fitting nickname, too — “Sugar.”</p>
<p>“My dad gave me that name for me back when I was in midget league,” Shane said. “I guess because I was sweet and shifty.”</p>
<p><strong>Stitch to Waynesburg</strong></p>
<p>Emmanuel Stitch, a member of Serra Catholic’s football and baseball teams the past four years, plans on playing both sports at Waynesburg. Stitch was a captain and two-year starter on the Eagles’ football team, and as a junior helped the baseball team reach the WPIAL and PIAA Class 2A championship games.&nbsp;</p>
