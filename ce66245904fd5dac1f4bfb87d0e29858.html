<h1>Bringing ‘receipts’ to N.H., Klobuchar says she can attract the broadest electoral coalition</h1>

<p>SALEM, N.H. —&nbsp;Like moderate Republicans and independent voters, Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar doesn’t agree with everything she sees on her party’s debate stage.</p>
<p>The U.S. senator from Minnesota admitted that to a crowd Sunday in this New Hampshire town, deeming her policies a pragmatic alternative to “bumper sticker solutions” that other candidates have proposed to solve serious problems.</p>
<p>“When we think about this, we’ve got to think about those people out there that maybe just think a little differently than us, who stayed home in 2016, or maybe you’re out there right now and you know friends of yours who voted for [now-President] Donald Trump or voted for an independent,” Ms. Klobuchar said, insisting that her party needs a “big tent” to win in November.</p>
<p>But one thing that unites everyone, she said, is that this election is a “decency check” on Mr. Trump, whom she described throughout her rally at Woodbury Middle School as an apathetic, entitled, dictator-loving despot who blames everyone else instead of taking responsibility.</p>
<p>She, like several other candidates who barnstormed New Hampshire this weekend in the lead-up to Tuesday’s first-in-the-nation primary, made the case as to why she can attract the broadest electoral coalition — but in her case, she “[brings] receipts," she said, outlining her history of winning in red districts in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she has been lagging in most polls.</p>
<p>Contrasting her policies to her Democratic opponents, Ms. Klobuchar said she starts “practically” on health care, asking the audience why anyone would want to scrap the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>“I think the best option is to make it better,” she said, proposing to add a nonprofit public option that would bring down the cost of premiums.</p>
<p>To make prescription drugs cheaper, she said she would empower Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, a bill she has sponsored in the Senate.</p>
<p>Quipping that her education policy doesn’t fit on a bumper sticker but “makes sense,” she said the government should put resources into cultivating a workforce that can fill jobs that have the most vacancies, including health care workers, nursing assistants, electricians and plumbers.</p>
<p>Ms. Klobuchar also said she would fund K-12 education and preschool in “a big way,” make one- and two-year degrees free, double funding into the federal Pell Grant program and fire Betsy DeVos as secretary of education, a line that garnered the loudest applause of the evening.</p>
<p>The senator had more than 1,000 people at her rally in Nashua earlier in the day, and garnered several hundred to this one — an audience she praised for skipping the Academy Awards to come out.</p>
<p>But many in the crowd came from outside New Hampshire, mostly from neighboring Massachusetts, and dozens were brought in by bus from Hofstra University in New York to tour the state and attend various primary events, the two professors who led the trip said.</p>
<p>Still, Ms. Klobuchar told the crowd her campaign is “surging,” claiming that she raised more than $3 million in the two days since Friday’s debate in nearby Manchester. She also touted an Emerson poll from Sunday that showed her in third place.</p>
