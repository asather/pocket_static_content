<h1>Learn from Rob Marshall, Gavin Creel and more in Pittsburgh CLO's new summer programs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In this time of a global pandemic and a crisis for theater and arts education, Pittsburgh CLO is reaching for the stars.</p>
<p>While CLO’s slate of 2020 summer productions has been canceled, the learning goes on: Oscar-nominated director Rob Marshall is among the luminaries coming to CLO’s online Institute of Performing Arts, which launches a new series of education programs this summer.</p>
<p>The just-announced lineup of classes, to be held from June 29-Aug. 21, includes six-time Tony nominee Marshall, who grew up in Squirrel Hill, attended Taylor Allderdice High School and Carnegie Mellon. He went on to Hollywood success as director of “Chicago” — which won the Academy Award for Best Picture — “Into the Woods” and “Mary Poppins Returns.”</p>
<p>Other luminaries coming to the program are Broadway choreographer Camille A. Brown (“Choir Boy,” “Once on This Island,” “Jesus Christ Superstar Live on NBC”), Gavin Creel (Tony Award-winner as a featured actor in “Hello, Dolly!”), dancer Neil Haskell (“Hamilton,” “So You Think You Can Dance”), Tony nominee and CMU alum Grey Henson (“Mean Girls,” “The Book of Mormon”) and Jackie Burns (“Wicked,” “If/Then”). Other instructors include Adam Kantor of “Rent” and “The Band’s Visit” and Broadway’s recent Evan Hansen, Andrew Barth Feldman.</p>
<p>Registrants may choose from among week-long workshops, weekend seminars, master classes, private lessons and professional development symposiums. The new programming will include university representatives from Carnegie Mellon, Point Park, Baldwin Wallace, Michigan and Penn State.</p>
<p>“These challenging times have presented unique opportunities," says Kiesha Lalama, CLO director of community engagement. "We aim to create a developmental platform for all ages, to enable full access to top talent by building a bridge to the industry’s leading professionals.”</p>
<p>CLO also will pull back the curtain on behind the scenes entertainment jobs, with guests Madison DeCoske (stage management, “Wicked”) Douglas Beau Hoffman (TV art department for “Big Brother,” “NAACP Image Awards,” “SAG Awards,” “Rachel Ray”) and Brad Broman (company management, “Hamilton” and “Hello, Dolly!”).</p>
<p>Besides those on a dedicated theatrical career track, the CLO offers options for families and all ages.
