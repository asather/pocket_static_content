<h1>Forced to watch from afar, Pitt's parents 'disappointed' Heinz Field will be empty Saturday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Patrick Jones’ parents aren’t angry. They’re just disappointed.</p>
<p>Angela and Patrick Jones Sr. won’t be sitting on the 35-yard line in Heinz Field’s lower bowl this Saturday, like they did all of last season. They won’t watch their son, Pitt’s star defensive end who skipped the 2020 NFL draft, potentially boost his stock against Austin Peay. They won’t look across the aisle and cheer with Jimmy Morrissey’s parents — or anyone else for that matter.</p>
<p>Heinz Field’s yellow seats will be empty on Saturday. They’ll be empty next week, when Pitt hosts Syracuse. And they’ll be empty the week after, when Louisville comes to town. No spectators, not even the parents who introduced their sons to football and have been to darn near every game since Pee Wee, will be allowed inside for September games, including Saturday’s season opener, due to COVID-19 concerns.</p>
<p>“It feels like a part of my life is missing, to be honest,” said Nia Hallett, mother of Pitt cornerback Erick Hallett. “I can count on one hand the amount of games that I’ve missed. So now it’s like, what do we do now?”</p>
<p>“This is Patrick’s first game of his last season,” Jones’ father said. “And you say to yourself, the stadium is so big. Close families and friends could get in there. But there are probably logistics that we don’t realize or recognize with Heinz Field.”</p>
<p>What it comes down to are the state guidelines. The decision isn’t Pitt’s to make.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf’s COVID-19 guidance for sports was updated last week to allow fans at high school, college and professional sporting events in Pennsylvania. However, fans, players, coaches and everyone else involved in the game count toward the state gathering limits. For an outdoor event, that’s 250 people.</p>
<p>A WPIAL soccer game might allow fans under those guidelines. But a college football game is basically impossible.</p>
<p>Gerald Harrison, Austin Peay’s athletic director, told the Post-Gazette that between players, coaches, support staff and senior administrators, the Governors have around 130 people in their traveling party this weekend. It’s unclear if all 130 will be in the stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pitt has 113 players on its roster. Usually most, if not all, players are on the sidelines for home games whether they’re seeing the field or not. That might change given the circumstances. The Panthers also have head coach Pat Narduzzi, 10 assistants and six quality control and graduate assistants, not to mention support staffers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saturday is going to push up to the 250-person limit. So even though there will be 68,400 vacant seats at Heinz Field, there’s actually no room for parents or fans.</p>
<p>“While we understand and respect the guidelines set forth by state health officials restricting in-person attendance at sporting events, we still feel particular disappointment for our student-athletes and their families,” Pitt athletics said in a statement, provided to the Post-Gazette by a spokesperson. “We remain in communication with the appropriate agencies and hope that we will be permitted to welcome our fans, and especially our players’ families, back to Heinz Field for contests beyond September.”</p>
<p>Pitt’s players and parents hope that’s the case, too. But in the meantime, some are looking at road game opportunities.</p>
<p>Miami allowed 13,000 fans at Hard Rock Stadium for its season opener on Saturday night. Florida State is expected to let in 16,000 to 20,000 fans at Doak Campbell Stadium, which has a capacity of 79,560. Clemson announced that 19,000 fans will be welcome at Memorial Stadium, which usually seats north of 80,000. Pitt travels to play Miami, Florida State and Clemson on Oct. 17, Nov. 7 and Nov. 28, respectively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pitt cornerback Jason Pinnock is hoping his grandmother and mom — a.k.a. his “road runners” — can watch him play sooner than that.</p>
<p>Pinnock, a Connecticut native and former Boston College commit, grew up an hour and a half from the Eagles’ Alumni Stadium. Boston College isn’t allowing fans for games in September, but that could change by time Pitt plays its first road game of the season on Oct. 10.</p>
<p>“It’s crazy,” Pinnock said, thinking of not having family at Heinz Field this weekend. “I know that they’ll be there. Just not physically there.”</p>
<p>Pitt captain Damar Hamlin feels the same way. The McKees Rocks native said it’s been at least 10 years since his parents missed a game. In the past, family members even came to practice during training camp, sometimes three times per week.</p>
<p>That didn’t happen this August. And after playing Austin Peay, Hamlin won’t be able to greet his family in the first row behind Pitt’s sideline, as he normally does. But while Hamlin patrols Pitt’s secondary on Saturday, he’ll also be in his family’s living room. After graduating from Central Catholic, he was given a life-size cutout of him in his Vikings uniform, which will be propped up Saturday as his family watches the ACC Network.</p>
<p>Jim Morrissey, the father of Pitt’s All-ACC center, will be in town watching the game, as well. The Philadelphia-area native plans to stay at a hotel with his wife, Siobhan, and his daughter. They’ll pull up to the hotel bar well before Saturday’s 4 p.m. kick to snag a few spots given the 25% capacity. They’re hoping the bar’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/09/11/comcast-espn-acc-network-channel-lineup-sling-armstrong-cable/stories/202009090045" target="_blank">television provider isn’t Comcast</a>; if it is, they’ll have to call an audible and relocate.</p>
<p>Wherever they end up watching the game, Jim Morrissey doesn’t really care. He’s just thankful his son has the opportunity to play this fall after watching the Big Ten and Pac-12 postpone their seasons.</p>
<p>“You have to look at it on the bright side,” Morrissey’s father said. “There are parents that aren’t able to play at Penn State or Michigan or anything else. Not that it’s any consolation, but I’m thrilled that Jimmy, Kenny, Damar and everyone will get the chance to play. We’ve concentrated on that.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, Jim and Siobhan Morrissey will try to put it out of their heads that they’re not at Heinz Field in person. So will rowmates Angela and Patrick Jones, who will watch from their home in Chesapeake, Va.</p>
<p>The Joneses understand why they can’t attend Saturday’s game, why there’s a need to take precautions. Jones’ father contracted COVID-19 in July, visited the ER twice and came close to being hospitalized. He’s back to 100% now, but his battle was “not a pretty sight.”</p>
<p>“So we get it,” Angela Jones said. “But it’s a little disappointing because we want to be there.”</p>
<p>Jones’ father added:&nbsp;“You just want to be there to cheer him on.”</p>
