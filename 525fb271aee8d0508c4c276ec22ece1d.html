<p>Life as a 23-year-old trying to become an adult has a lot of challenges. Figuring out how to navigate your first adult job while still learning who you are can be a struggle. Now imagine facing challenges of adulthood and being a pro player in front of tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget about the trolls on Twitter and Instagram. Pirates shortstop Cole Tucker learned that life in the show could humble you.</p>
<p>“You have to have a plan, and you have to make adjustments and you have to rely on your approach and have a good approach,” Tucker said Saturday during PiratesFest at PNC Park. “When I was going good last year, that’s what was working for me. When it wasn’t, I was up there just trying to get by athletically.</p>
<p>“When you get home, you get to take in all that you learned during the season and roll that into the next season, so I feel really good about where I’m at and where I’m going because of the failure and information from last year. I feel confident about what I can do going into this year, so I’m excited about that.”</p>
<p>Tucker hit a game-winning home run in his big league debut on April 20 against the San Francisco Giants at PNC Park. Fans were excited about the affable kid from Arizona. Unfortunately, Tucker wasn’t able to repeat that moment often in 2019. He hit .097 in May before getting sent back to the minors in June.</p>
<p>A lot of people would let that moment get them down, but Tucker found positives. He&nbsp;took the demotion and worked on his craft at the plate.</p>
<p>“Hitting is about being on time and hitting the ball hard, swinging at good pitches,” Tucker said. “I didn’t do as well here, but I definitely feel like I hit the ball pretty hard here in the big leagues last year. I didn’t find consistent results like I was in Indianapolis. The more I can put myself in a better athletic position to do that, the more success I’m going to have.”</p>
<p>Tucker exudes energy, even at 8 a.m. on a gloomy Saturday. He’s hoping his confidence will translate to a better 2020.</p>
<p>“There’s always something to be learned, but for me personally, it was that I believe I can play shortstop in the big leagues,” Tucker said. “I think I showed that. I think I showed this team that. I believe that. I’ve always believed that. Athletically, in the box, what I told you guys before — you can’t just show up and compete here, because if you have a hole or a deficiency, it gets spotted and they figure it out pretty quick.</p>
<p>“When the Cubs figure it out, so do the Brewers and the Reds and every other team. The game here is a lot smarter. It’s not like we’re freaky robot athletes here and they aren’t.</p>
<p>Tucker is one of many Pirates looking forward to a fresh start with new manager Derek Shelton and mostly new coaching staff.</p>
<p>“The feeling with the coaching staff and the team right now, the vibe is way better right now,” Tucker said. “And that’s not to kick dirt on anyone, because that’s not what I’m here to do, but we as a collective need to move forward into 2020 and beyond, and I really like where we’re at. It just feels cozy and team-y and fun. I’m excited.”</p>
<p>Another reason for Tucker’s affinity toward Shelton? Tucker being able to keep his coils, even if it comes with a few jokes.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t want me to get a haircut,” Tucker said. “But he gives me crap [about it]. You can ask him what he thinks about my hair, he’ll say, ‘Oh he’s getting it cut by February time.’ He doesn’t want us to wear suits on the plane, so he’s just laid back. He’s got some feel. He’s chill. But he seems really cool, his family seems great. Can’t wait to work with him more.”</p>
