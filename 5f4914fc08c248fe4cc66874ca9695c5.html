<h1>Pirates stand pat at MLB trade deadline</h1>

<p>MILWAUKEE — The Pirates made a bit of a curious move Monday for the MLB trade deadline.</p>
<p>They did nothing.</p>
<p>Their lone move, according to a source, will remain sending Jarrod Dyson to the Chicago White Sox for $243,300 of international bonus pool money for the 2019-20 signing period, which was extended through Oct. 15.</p>
<p>Why did the Pirates not do anything?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>And one we’ll likely need general manager Ben Cherington to fully answer. Cherington is scheduled to meet with the media at 4:30 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>The Pirates came into Monday’s deadline with the belief that they had at least a few assets to peddle. Perhaps Keone Kela and Adam Frazier would go. Even high-leverage reliever Richard Rodriguez.</p>
<p>None of that came to fruition, as the Pirates were one of only a few teams that stood pat.</p>
<p>There are a couple reasons, though. For one, Chris Archer is out for the season after having surgery to alleviate symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome. He would’ve been one of their biggest pieces.</p>
<p>Then, Keone Kela went down with right forearm tightness, continuing a run of throwing-arm issues he’s experienced since the start of the 2019 season.</p>
<p>Other players — Frazier is a good example — simply struggled early, potentially hurting their trade value.</p>
<p><strong>Moran back</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates on Monday announced that they've reinstated Colin Moran from the seven-day concussion list. To clear space, Will Craig has been optioned to their alternate training site in Altoona.</p>
