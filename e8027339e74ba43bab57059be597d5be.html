<h1>Eyeing 2020, House Democrats pass expansive labor bill to expand power of unions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — With each new wave of members, the largest industrial labor union in North America grew its official name into today’s mouthful of professions: The United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Thursday, members of the Pittsburgh-based union — known colloquially as the United Steelworkers — watched from the public gallery as the House of Representatives passed by a 224-194<strong>&nbsp;</strong>vote, historic legislation that greatly expands the power of the country’s unions to organize members and bargain with employers.</p>
<p>The Protecting the Right to Organize Act, viewed by unions as the most&nbsp;expansive labor bill in 85 years, would classify independent contractors as employees, prevent employers from permanently replacing striking workers and impose&nbsp;financial penalties on employers that interfere with organizing efforts.</p>
<p>The bill would also eliminate right-to-work laws <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2017/01/23/WorkZone-Right-to-work-laws-gain-momentum-following-election/stories/201701290006?cid=search" target="_blank">passed by more than two dozen states</a> to allow private-sector workers to opt out of paying dues. A Supreme Court ruling in June 2018 allowed public-sector workers in all states to stop paying dues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill is likely dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, where hundreds of House bills have piled up over the last year.</p>
<p>But for Democrats up for re-election in 2020 — and union leaders hoping to solidify support from members on national initiatives — the PRO Act served as an opportunity to message the need to update the nation’s labor laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s a test to see who is actually going to stand with workers,”&nbsp;said Lindsey Disler, a Pittsburgh-based organizer for the United Steelworkers who traveled to Washington for the vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Disler — who has focused much of her energy on organizing faculty and graduate students at the University of Pittsburgh — said getting to a union election is a struggle because employers often hire a team of lawyers and use intimidation tactics that skirt the law.</p>
<p>“A lot of [organizing] campaigns have to be underground because employers mount extremely aggressive anti-union campaigns,” Ms. Disler said. “The sooner they know about it, the longer they have to mount that campaign and go after workers.”</p>
<p>Business groups registered alarm at the bill.</p>
<p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called it a “litany of almost every failed idea from the past 30 years of labor policy” that would “undermine worker rights, ensnare employers in unrelated labor disputes, disrupt the economy and force individual Americans to pay union dues.”</p>
<p>Republicans took to the House floor on Thursday in droves and lobbed a series of amendments, which were voted down by Democrats. They pointed to more than 10 years of economic expansion as evidence unions are not needed anymore.</p>
<p>“Rather than innovating to become more attractive to employees, unions are trying to change federal law to stack the deck against hardworking Americans,” said Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-Lancaster, in a floor speech.</p>
<p>“Americans aren’t rejecting union membership because of current labor law, they are declining to join because they are sick of union leaders coercing their colleagues and lining their pockets with money,” he said.</p>
<p>The PRO Act is the latest example of the union flexing its mobilization muscles on Capitol Hill. When Democrats seized control of the House of Representatives last year, it spelled an opportunity for labor to make legislative gains.</p>
<p>During the union’s annual legislation and policy conference in October, the bill was a central objective as more than 600 members <a href="/" target="_blank">swarmed the hallways of Congress,</a> knocking on members’ doors, holding rallies and training coordinators how to talk about politics with more ambivalent members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Thursday, dozens of members fanned out and dropped fliers in 216 offices. Members have made more than 1,200 calls to Congressional offices about the bill.</p>
<p>The PRO Act is “fundamental to what we do,” said Amber Miller, director of the USW’s Rapid Response program, which brings workers to Washington. “It’s something our members can get behind, like 100 percent.”</p>
<p>Unions have long contended with a gradual decline in membership. In 2019, about 676,000 Pennsylvania workers were union members, or 12% of the total workforce, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s down from 701,000, or about 12.6% of the workforce, the year before.</p>
<p>In recent years, the United Steelworkers has entered new territory as the large industrial facilities that were big prizes during organized labor’s heyday have been replaced by hospitals, schools and casinos.</p>
<p>Overall, more than four dozen labor unions have <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2018/06/04/Labor-unions-organize-workers-election-Service-Employees-International-Union-SEIU-United-Steelworkers-International-Brotherhood-of-Teamsters/stories/201801020001?cid=search" target="_blank">petitioned for nearly 300 elections</a> in recent years, according to a 2018 Post-Gazette analysis of federal union election data. In those elections, unions have added more than 8,000 workers in the Pittsburgh region to membership rolls.</p>
