<h1>Epps brothers lead South Allegheny to 77-59 win vs. Steel Valley, claim section title</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steel Valley’s Cam Polak is having a season to remember, and he continued his torrid scoring pace Friday night with a 36-point performance at South Allegheny</p>
<p>The Gladiators, though, are having a season their fans might never forget.</p>
<p>WPIAL Class 3A No. 4-ranked South Allegheny (15-1, 9-0) wrapped up only the second section title in school history — and its first since 1997 — with a 77-59 win against the Ironmen (10-6, 6-3).</p>
<p>“This is the most success we’ve had in a really, really long time,” Gladiators coach Tony DiCenzo said. “All the hard work and the dedication that these kids have been putting in, we’re seeing the results of that now. We’re a young team. We don’t have a senior, so this could be a sign of things to come here.”</p>
<p>South Allegheny’s hot-shooting tandem of brothers Bryce and Antonio Epps led the way with 30 and 29 points, respectively. Bryce, a freshman, scored 20 of his career-high 30 in the second half, while Antonio, a junior, put up 17 after the break to help close out the win.</p>
<p>Not only that, Bryce registered four steals, including three while guarding Polak.</p>
<p>“It feels great, because this is the first time in a while we’ve had a gym full of people supporting us,” Bryce Epps said. “I’m just at a loss for words right now. It’s unbelievable.</p>
<p>“To go out and play the way we did, it feels great.”</p>
<p>The Gladiators went 6-15 a year ago and won just 28 games combined over the past five seasons. They are only four years removed from a 1-20 season, and the year before DiCenzo arrived in 2011-12 they went 0-21.</p>
<p>Now, they’re tied for the second-most wins in the WPIAL, and they’re beginning to set their sights on loftier goals than just winning a section title.</p>
<p>“Kudos to our kids for showing up in a big moment,” DiCenzo said. “It’s the first time they’ve ever had a packed gym to capacity, and with what was at stake and the environment here, it didn’t rattle us, and that tells me we’re capable of bigger and better things.”</p>
<p>The skinny freshman point guard with a silky-smooth shooting stroke and poise beyond his years is certainly a big reason why, but he’s quick to deflect the credit to the rest of his teammates.</p>
<p>“It’s all a team effort,” Bryce Epps said. “We have great chemistry. We all support each other. It doesn’t matter if I’m the leading scorer or my brother’s the leading scorer.</p>
<p>“We’re a family. We all support each other no matter what.”</p>
<p>Bryce Epps scored 10 points in the first quarter, showing no fear in the biggest game of his young high school career while helping South Allegheny jump to a 17-5 lead. Steel Valley couldn’t get any type of rhythm going on offense, and the Gladiators soon built a 25-9 lead and threatened to turn the game into a blowout.</p>
<p>That’s when shots started to fall for the Ironmen, who went on a 14-4 run to close out the half and cut South Allegheny’s lead to 29-23 at the break.</p>
<p>The Gladiators began to regain momentum on back-to-back 3-pointers by Bryce Epps early in the third quarter, but Polak started heating up with back-to-back 3s of his own. A 3-pointer by Shane Reagan cut South Allegheny’s lead to four, but Bryce Epps made a veteran play with a steal and score after an inbounds pass to put the Gladiators up, 49-41, late in the third.</p>
<p>Bryce Epps closed the third quarter with a 3-pointer, then drained another 3 to start the fourth, giving South Allegheny a 55-44 lead. His older brother then helped seal the win with clutch free-throw shooting and timely 3-pointers late in the final quarter.</p>
<p>Antonio Epps, who came into the game averaging a team-high 19.1 points per game, was as proud as could be of his younger brother — but he wasn’t surprised.</p>
<p>“I honestly feel like he’s made for it,” he said.</p>
<p>“He puts in a lot of work, getting up early in the morning, doing a lot of drills and getting shots up.</p>
<p>“I feel like he’s definitely built for these moments, and today, he proved it.”</p>
