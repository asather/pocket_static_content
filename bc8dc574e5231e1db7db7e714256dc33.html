<h1>Want to hear what your employees say about your management? </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Happy with the money. Love the environment.”</p>
<p>That comment came from an employee of Don’s Appliances last year when the company’s 170 staff members were polled as part of the Post-Gazette’s annual Top Workplaces program.</p>
<p>In total, almost 20,000 employees were surveyed in the Pittsburgh region last year as workers had the chance to anonymously explain what it’s like drawing a paycheck from that business or organization.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to be learned from staffers who drive trucks at Pitt Ohio or work with children at Tender Care Learning Centers or keep things running at WesBanco.</p>
<p>As a group, America’s employees have seen it all. They’ve been tested, hired, laid off and forced into wacky bonding exercises. They’ve been raised up or brought down by annual reviews. They’ve been overpaid, underpaid, burnt out and invigorated.</p>
<p>And they’ve amassed a strongly held set of opinions on what works and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>We took a look back at the anonymous comments submitted last year by employees who were asked why they like their jobs. The polling was done by Energage, which serves as the research partner to the Post-Gazette and many other newspapers in the country. In total, Energage surveyed 2.5 million employees at more than 7,500 organizations in 2019.</p>
<p>Here are some of the lessons that emerged from the people at Pittsburgh-area workforces that were named Top Workplaces in 2019:</p>
<p><strong>1. Don’t micromanage:</strong></p>
<p>— “I have the freedom to do my job. I never feel like I am being micromanaged. I feel very much part of the management team. My ideas/suggestions are listened to.” —<em>&nbsp;Re/Max Select Realty employee</em></p>
<p>— “I am helping people solve their problems; Baker's trusts me to do my job without micromanaging my time, and offers correction without condemnation.” —<em>&nbsp;Baker’s Waterproofing&nbsp;employee</em></p>
<p>— “I have the freedom to take ownership and work in a way that best highlights my strengths. I am supported but not micromanaged. I can set individual goals without upper management interfering my own expectations of myself.” <em>— NDX Albensi&nbsp;employee</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Offer interesting challenges:</strong></p>
<p>— “I'm encouraged to try new things … Love that everyday is a different challenge and I haven't had the same day twice in my time here.” <em>— Walnut Capital&nbsp;employee</em></p>
<p>— “It is challenging and never boring. I am always learning and I love the people I work with.”&nbsp;<em>— Keystone Dedicated Logistics&nbsp;employee</em></p>
<p><strong>3. A little fun and people who like each other is a good thing:</strong></p>
<p>— “I get to work with a great group of coworkers. The members at the drop-in have been a lot of fun. Some days I go home feeling great about myself for the laughs I got at work.” <em>— Center for Community</em> <em>Resources Inc.&nbsp;employee</em></p>
<p>— “I absolutely love the people I am working with and I like the collaborative nature of our work. We can learn so much from the individuals in our group because everyone has had different experiences with clients and project tasks.” —&nbsp;<em>Grossman Yanak &amp; Ford&nbsp;employee</em></p>
<p><strong>4. Pay, benefits and flexibility are part of the picture:</strong></p>
<p>— “We are held to a very high standard and we are compensated well. The partners hold themselves to the same high standards so they set a good example. I enjoy the fast pace and the large volume of cases.” —<em>&nbsp;Edgar Snyder&nbsp;employee</em></p>
<p>— “I'm supported when I take risks and my well-being is cared for. In addition, the great work/life balance allows me to focus on my young family just as much my career.” —<em>Truefit&nbsp;employee</em></p>
<p>— “A casual work environment where I can produce great results that influence the company. Also, we have dogs and lunch provided!” <em>— Seegrid Corp. employee</em></p>
<p><strong>5. Keep good managers, if you want to keep good people:</strong></p>
<p>— “I have the best manager I've ever had at any job, and it isn't even close. He's an amazing person and an amazing manager and I feel very fortunate to work for him. I frequently get contacted by ‘headhunters’ and I've given the same answer for years: I'm not interested in changing jobs, I'm not looking to change, and I don't plan to be anytime in the future.” —&nbsp;<em>Carnegie Learning&nbsp;employee</em></p>
<p><strong>How to participate</strong></p>
<p>To learn what your employees think about your own management, your work structure and what they’re telling potential recruits, nominate your company for the Post-Gazette’s 2020 Top Workplaces program.</p>
<p>It’s free.</p>
<p>Any organization with 50 or more employees in the Pittsburgh area is eligible. That includes public and private companies, nonprofits and government entities.</p>
<p>Energage will contact the company between January and March to set up the polling, which involves asking employees a short 24-question survey. Not all companies will earn the designation as a Top Workplace, but all of those that participate will receive results to learn from.</p>
<p>Those named as Top Workplaces will be featured <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/topworkplaces2019/" target="_blank">in a special Post-Gazette editorial section</a> and honored at an event in August.</p>
<p>The deadline to nominate a company is Feb. 14, 2020 (Yes, it’s Valentine’s Day).</p>
