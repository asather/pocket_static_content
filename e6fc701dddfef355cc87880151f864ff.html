<p>WVU&nbsp;“takes seriously its responsibility to protect our campuses during this uncertain time” as it monitors the coronavirus threat,&nbsp;university president Gordon Gee said in a Tuesday <a href="https://presidentgee.wvu.edu/messages/president-gee-announces-plan-to-mitigate-the-community-spread-of-covid-19" target="_blank">letter</a> to the campus community ahead of the March 16-20 spring break.</p>

<p>There are no reported cases of COVID-19 in the Mountain State.</p>
<p>The spread of coronavirus has unsettled campuses throughout the country. Communal gatherings are being rescheduled in an effort to prevent infections. And, on the cusp of spring break, campuses are urging students to rethink travel plans.</p>
<p>In WVU’s case, the university&nbsp;university leaders were concerned about the subsequent return to campus after travel.</p>
<p>“We want to be cautious, and we want to make sure our campus community and our local communities stay safe and healthy,”&nbsp;Clay Marsh, WVU Health Sciences vice president and executive dean, said of the decision that was&nbsp;made out of an abundance of caution to best protect its campuses and the communities at-large.</p>
<p>Dr. Marsh added:&nbsp;“By working together and avoiding panic, we will demonstrate the resilience and grit of West Virginia.”</p>
<p>Students were encouraged to&nbsp;take <a href="https://housing.wvu.edu/current-residents/residence-hall-current-residents/residence-hall-break-housing" target="_blank">essential items</a> with them as they left for spring break.</p>
<p>In the meantime, WVU said it was working to&nbsp;offer class instruction delivered remotely via online or other alternative learning options.</p>
<p>“We are fortunate to have the resources and expertise to provide a high level of instruction remotely” provost Maryanne Reed said, “and we will make every effort to ensure that our students don’t get behind in their coursework.”</p>
<p>All university related international and domestic travel is suspended, unless approved, through March 30, WVU also said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, WVU is working with faculty and Information Technology Services to offer class instruction delivered remotely via online or other alternative learning options beginning March 30.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Morgantown-based university’s announcement&nbsp;came a day after Ohio State University announced that it would suspend face-to-face instruction through the end of the month.</p>
<p>In neighboring Pennsylvania — with the number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in the state at 10 as of Monday afternoon — the University of Pittsburgh was helping faculty prepare for the possibility of a vastly different reality once students return from spring break next week — from holding some classes online, if necessary, to suspension of face-to-face instruction altogether.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/09/covid-19-coverage-no-paywall" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Pitt is not alone in developing contingencies. So are many other campuses in the region, among them Penn State University and Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>On Monday, Carnegie Mellon announced that with Qatar officials closing campuses in that country to slow the virus’s spread, CMU-Qatar would shutter at midnight, classes would be postponed for two days and then resume online Thursday indefinitely.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Amherst College, the University of Washington and Princeton, Stanford and New York universities have announced dramatic changes in recent days. Indiana University announced face-to-face teaching will be temporarily suspended after spring break. At Harvard University, students have been instructed to return to their homes away from campus after spring break and complete coursework remotely.</p>
<p>Colleges are in an unusual position, said&nbsp;Sarah Van Orman, chief health officer with USC Student Health. There’s clearly a higher risk of infections spreading in a communal living situation and in classrooms. But unlike K-12 schools that might shut down to minimize the chance of transmission of infections, “for a university, the idea of everyone leaving campus and coming back is, unfortunately, a risky situation.”</p>
<p>More than 60,000 students are enrolled at OSU’s main campus in Columbus.</p>
<p>“These students come from every nook and cranny on the planet Earth,” said Lanier Holt, an assistant professor in OSU’s School of Communication. “Even if a handful of people contracted the virus, we’ve basically made a petri dish for the virus. And then we spread it when the semester ends in about six weeks, all over the world.”</p>
