<h1>Gene Collier: Hall of Fame is closed to Pirates of Bob Nutting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>To relieve the throbbing shame of its fresh sign-stealing scandal, baseball got a serendipitously timed jolt of adrenaline this week from its annual announcement about brand new Hall of Famers.</p>
<p>All sincere congrats to Derek Jeter and Larry Walker, but even this big reveal doesn’t provide the sugar high that it once did.</p>
<p>Now, every vote is followed by a rhetorical tsunami of criticism, most of it via social media, for the Hall, the process, the voters, and particularly for the snubbers and sometimes even the snubbees.</p>
<p>The enduring truth is that if there’s going to be a Hall of Fame in anything, there are going to be arguments about who is in it and who isn’t. Not just in sports. I mean <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>I can get a raging argument within minutes over any number of enshrinees in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame (Hall &amp; Oates, for the love of God. Bobby Darin?), and you can be just as certain that as sure as there’s an International Towing and Recovery Hall of Fame and Museum (oh yes, Chattanooga), somebody with a battered truck is royally peeved that he or she is not in it.</p>
<p>Baseball’s Hall generates more than its share of controversy, which is why I think it would be useful to cite one aspect relative to Cooperstown on which we can all agree. So long as Bob Nutting owns the Pirates, there will never be another player enshrined wearing a Pirates hat on his plaque.</p>
<p>Sad but true.</p>
<p>Hall of Famers generally have to be great players, and great players who can build a Hall of Fame resume tend to cost a great deal of money, and, of course, we don’t do that around here.</p>
<p>The last great Pirate to retire was probably Jean Lafitte, or at least that’s the way it seems since it was more than 30 years ago, 1988, that Willie Stargell was inducted through the current voting process. Were he around today, Stargell would not be retiring as a Pirate. He was better than Josh Donaldson, who this week signed a $92 million contract with the Minnesota Twins, not the prototype of big market capability. Ninety-two-million would not get you Stargell for four more years.</p>
<p>The Pirates probably won’t be able keep Josh Bell when he qualifies for free agency in 2023. Like Donaldson, Bell isn’t Stargell, yet he might be similar to No. 8 by that time. But the fact is, Nutting has the franchise frozen into a posture where it has to hope like hell it cannot afford Bell in three years. If it can, that only means he’s been a big disappointment.</p>
<p>Don’t fool yourself into thinking this situation is changing.</p>
<p>Even after one of the most embarrassing seasons in club history, Nutting’s 2020 payroll will be some insignificant fraction of what Pittsburgh’s divisional brethren pay their rosters. Even after losing 93 times, burrowing into the NL Central basement, and forcing even the indifferent Nutting to run off the manager, the general manager, and the team president, any commitment to Pirates improvement has already been betrayed by the wholly underwhelming acquisitions of another dreary offseason.</p>
<p>Explanations by new management do not reflect any particular urgency about any of this.</p>
<p>““One of the things [general manager] Ben [Cherington] said when he took the job is that we were going to identify what we have,” new field manager <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/23/Pirates-Derek-Shelton-offseason-quiet-trades-Ben-Cherington-signings-rebuilding-Nutting-spending/stories/202001230090" target="_blank">Derek Shelton said to our own Jason Mackey</a>. “For us to do that, we have to take our time, and we have to see players on the field. We have to work off that.”</p>
<p>This pretty safely assumes the Pirates will not have “cracked the code” any time soon.</p>
<p>It was new team president Travis Williams who noted at his introductory press conference that the Brewers, A’s, and Rays were primary examples of smaller market teams who have “cracked the code,” which I guess is a welcome change in thematic initiatives from “change the culture,” but as for a foundational shift, I much prefer the slogan actor Michael Keaton suggested that time he came home to throw out the first pitch: “Write the check!”</p>
<p>So call me when there’s a press conference to introduce the new owner, one who can keep a shortstop like Jeter around for 20 years with annual salaries as high as $23 million, who can keep a bullpen hammer like Mariano Rivera around for 19 years with annual salaries as high as $15 million, and one who can keep Mike Trout around for 19 years with annual salaries of up to $37 million.</p>
<p>Those guys are Hall of Famers or, in Trout’s case, will be. You get a few of those guys, you might just win something.</p>
