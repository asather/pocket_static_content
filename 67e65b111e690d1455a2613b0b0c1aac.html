<p>With the fate of college football’s 2020 season still up in the air, fans can count on hearing a couple of the sport’s most prominent voices at least once this fall — during a Steelers game, no less.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29680109/steve-levy-louis-riddick-brian-griese-man-monday-night-football-booth" target="_blank">ESPN announced Monday</a> that their lead college broadcast duo of play-by-play man Chris Fowler and analyst Kirk Herbstreit will call the team’s season-opening “Monday Night Football” matchup against the New York Giants on Sept. 14 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.</p>
<p>The pair have&nbsp;shared the booth for ABC’s “Saturday Night Football” since 2015 and&nbsp;worked together on ESPN’s uber-popular “College GameDay” show, frequently providing commentary for many of the college ranks’ marquee matchups. Now they’ll be dabbling in the pros for the first time.</p>
<p>“Chris and Kirk are commentators at the top of their game and have thrilled college football fans for many years,” ESPN executive vice president of content Connor Schell said in a statement Monday. “We are looking to add new opportunities to their expansive portfolios and are confident that NFL fans will be just as excited to hear one of the most prolific broadcasting duos on Monday Night Football.”</p>
<p>The network on Monday also made official news that had been a poorly kept secret in the industry for weeks. Pitt product Louis Riddick will join fellow analyst Brian Griese and veteran anchor and play-by-play Steve Levy to form the lead “Monday Night Football” broadcast team. They’ll make their debut later in the evening Sept. 14, when they’ll call the Tennessee Titans’ clash with the Broncos in Denver.</p>
<p>Riddick played for the Panthers from 1987 to 1990 and was chosen in the ninth round of the 1991 NFL draft. He played eight seasons in the league before moving into the scouting and executive ranks for a few years.</p>
<p>He joined ESPN as an analyst in 2013, and his profile has consistently grown as he’s contributed on the network’s most prominent studio shows as well as NFL draft coverage. Now he’ll get a chance with ESPN’s signature franchise, which has seen frequent turnover in the booth over the last handful of years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Steve, Brian and Louis are trusted voices of the NFL whose knowledge and love of football connects with fans,” Schell said in his statement. “We are thrilled that they will join Lisa Salters to make up our new Monday Night Football team and share their passion and insight with football fans in what promises to be a great broadcast each week.”</p>
