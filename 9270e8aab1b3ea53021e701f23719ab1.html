<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The 2020 Oscars will once again go forward without a host.</p>
<p>ABC Entertainment president Karey Burke made the announcement on Wednesday, in a presentation at the Television Critics Association. Burke said the decision to repeat "what worked for us last year" was made in concert with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Oscars ceremony will be telecast live by ABC on Feb.&nbsp;9 from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Last year's ceremony was the first <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/25/entertainment/oscar-takeaways/index.html" target="_blank">host-free Oscars</a>&nbsp;since 1989.&nbsp;Kevin Hart was initially announced as the host of the 2019 ceremony, but he was scrapped after what was considered to be a botched apology about anti-gay tweets from his past.</p>
