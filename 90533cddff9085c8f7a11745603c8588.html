<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At the recommendation of its municipal traffic board, Mt. Lebanon Commissioners on Feb. 25 approved a traffic calming study for Arden Road at a cost not to exceed $13,250.</p>
<p>Residents living in the Arden Road neighborhood first approached the traffic board in June 2019 with a formal petition for traffic calming in the area.</p>
<p>Once it commences, the study will look at 22 locations along Arden Road. Two automatic traffic recorders at the locations will collect 48 hours of continuous data including traffic volume, vehicle class and speed.</p>
<p>The data will then be collected by Tri State Traffic Data, a sub-consultant of Gateway Engineers, which is Mt. Lebanon’s engineering firm.</p>
<p>Commissioners also approved several purchases at the Feb. 25 meeting.</p>
<p>They included:</p>
<p>• One trailer-mounted leaf loader at a cost of $61,845 from A&amp;H Equipment of Zelienople.</p>
<p>• One 2020 Ford Transit 250 cargo van at a cost of $42,000 for use as a mobile command vehicle by the Mt. Lebanon Police Department. The vehicle, which is being purchased from Woltz and Wind Ford, replaces an older command vehicle that has reached the end of its useful life.</p>
<p>• Two 2020 Ford Police Interceptor utility vehicles from Woltz and Wind Ford to be used by the patrol and traffic units of the Mt. Lebanon Police Department at a total cost of $78,568. The vehicles will replace older vehicles. Both of the new vehicles will have hybrid engines.</p>
<p>• One 2020 Ford F550 four-wheel-drive snowplow truck from Woltz and Wind Ford at a cost of $93,505. The new truck replaces a 2011 Ford F550.</p>
