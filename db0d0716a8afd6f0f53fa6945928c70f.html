<h1>Westinghouse gets OT win against Allderdice in City League showdown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The way Westinghouse coach Donta Green saw it, his offense lacked rhythm in Thursday night’s City League showdown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Westinghouse’s defense has zero beat.</p>
<p>Westinghouse and Allderdice went to overtime at Cupples Stadium on the South Side. And for the second consecutive week, Westinghouse made a top City League team leave the place with a bagel on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>Last week, it was Brashear that was held to zero points by Westinghouse. This time Westinghouse knocked off Allderdice, 8-0, in overtime.</p>
<p>Westinghouse won the game by scoring first in overtime on Malik Harris’ 10-yard run, and then adding a two-point conversion. On Allderdice’s possession in overtime, Westinghouse stopped Allderdice on fourth down from the 2-yard line to end the game.</p>
<p>“Weird. Extremely weird,” Westinghouse coach Donta Green said in describing a game that was scoreless after four quarters. “But this was good for us because we have a lot of young guys. So we got an opportunity to see what those guys have.”</p>
<p>What Westinghouse has is a zero-tolerance policy — and a firm grip on the top spot in the City League after two weeks. Westinghouse is 2-0. The Bulldogs are the defending City champions, but they have only two starters back on both sides of the ball this season. They entered the season as the Post-Gazette’s No. 3 City team, but blanked No. 1 Brashear in the season opener. The win moved Westinghouse to No. 1, and Allderdice entered the game No. 2.</p>
<p>Westinghouse’s players were loud in celebration while boarding the team bus after the game.</p>
<p>“It’s a big win because there was a lot of talk on social media about this game, the kids texting,” Green said. “A lot of them are friends from both teams. So this is a big win for them personally.</p>
<p>“We had so many question marks going into this game because we’re such a young team. Last week, our guys kind of got their feet under them. I think this game instills some confidence.”</p>
<p>One of the leaders of Westinghouse’s defense is senior defensive back Darius Bruce, one of the \ two defensive starters returning from last year. Bruce had an interception against Allderdice.</p>
<p>“Every game is a statement game for us. The last one was, and this game was a statement game,” Bruce said. “I mean, they ranked us No. 3 after we just won the City ‘ship. That was crazy. So we have to go out and show every game.”</p>
<p>Westinghouse’s offense didn’t show much as the Bulldogs had only 127 yards offense, including 96 rushing yards.&nbsp;Allderdice’s offense wasn’t a whole lot better, finishing with only 168 yards. The Dragons (1-1) were penalized nine times for 105 yards in the second half.</p>
<p>In the first half, Allderdice had the best chances to score. The Dragons moved from their own 10 to the Westinghouse 25 early in the second quarter, but two plays lost 5 yards before Shakur Pack-Adams’ pass into the end zone was intercepted by Bruce.</p>
<p>On its final possession of the first half, Allderdice moved from the 37 and eventually had a first-and-goal at the Westinghouse 5. After three plays, Allderdice moved only 1 yard and Pack-Adams ran a quarterback draw into the middle of the line on fourth down, but was stopped just short of the goal line.</p>
<p>Westinghouse had scoring chances in the second half, moving to the Allderdice 19. But Allderdice’s Marcel Holyfield intercepted Keyshawn Morsillo on third down.&nbsp;The game ended with Westinghouse on the Brashear 20-yard line.</p>
<p>In OT, Allderdice&nbsp;won the overtime toss, but elected to go on defense first. Westinghouse’s Harris ran 10 yards for the touchdown on first down.</p>
<p>On Allderdice’s possession, an offside penalty on Westinghouse moved the ball to the 5. After two running plays gained 3 yards, running back Robert Brown was tackled in the backfield by Roderick Jeter for a loss.</p>
<p>“Honestly, the energy was never there with us from the first play,” Green said. “We played very flat offensively. But when we went into overtime, it seemed like the energy came back.”</p>
