<h1>Pitt's Kenny Pickett, Penn State's Sean Clifford finish mid-pack in Pro Football Focus QB rankings</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pro Football Focus isn’t too impressed by Pitt’s Kenny Pickett or Penn State’s Sean Clifford.</p>
<p>The former guided the Panthers to their best record since 2016 and their first bowl win under veteran coach Pat Narduzzi. The latter kept the Nittany Lions in the College Football Playoff conversation until late in the season and earned a signature victory at the Cotton Bowl in late December.</p>
<p>Still, the scouting website that ranks players by every snap they take in a given game put both signal callers mid-pack in its <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/college-pff-rankings-starting-quarterback-rankings-for-2019?utm_source=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=cjaff&amp;cjevent=b30de83a3b8d11ea80e204550a240613" target="_blank">season-ending ranking</a> of college football’s top quarterbacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clifford finished 12 spots above his rival at No. 55 overall, but that is small consolation for his precipitous drop from a No. 24 perch in the midseason rankings, which were released in October. PFF attributed that decline to his performance in key situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>After teasing the Penn State fans with four big-time throws on just seven completions in very limited duty in 2018, Clifford did enough to hold on to some games in 2019 but lacked those big-play moments that the PSU faithful have become accustomed to. Compared to those four big-time throws in 2018, he unleashed just 11 of them this season and had 12 turnover-worthy passes to boot. He’ll have to tighten up on the latter if Penn State wants to win more than just 10-11 wins in a season and maybe rely on his intermediate passing ability as he connected on 36-of-67 attempts for 728 yards and seven scores, finishing as the nation’s seventh highest-graded passer to the 10-19-yard range this year.</em></p>
<p>The redshirt sophomore’s overall stats — 2,654 yards and 23 touchdowns against just seven interceptions — were still pretty good, though. In fact, there were a bit better than predecessor Trace McSorley’s were in 2018, his final season in Happy Valley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pickett, meanwhile, posted a modest gain from his midseason ranking, rising to No. 67 from No. 73, and earned plaudits for finishing strong.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Pickett’s stretch of athletic play was something to behold for Pitt fans this season, finishing the final four games of the season with an elite overall grade. Three of his four highest-graded outings came over the final four games, and without those, he would have been much further down these rankings. He may have been the only quarterback with at least 500 dropbacks to average fewer than 7.0 yards per pass attempt, but his 36 dropped passes certainly left a lot to be desired this season. Taking that into account, his 75.2% adjusted completion percentage makes his season look much better than his 61.5% box-score completion number.</em></p>
<p>Pickett’s more traditional numbers were mixed in 2019. His&nbsp;3,098 passing yards were more than 1,000 more than he posted in 2018, his first season as a starter. His 13:9 touchdown-to-interception ratio left a lot to be desired, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LSU’s Joe Burrow topped the list after claiming the Heisman Trophy and guiding the Tigers to a national championship victory last week in New Orleans. He was followed by Clemson’s Trevor Lawrence, Ohio State’s Justin Fields, Oklahoma’s Jalen Hurts and Alabama’s combo of&nbsp;Tua Tagovailoa and Mac Jones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clifford finished seventh among Big Ten quarterbacks, trailing Fields, Minnesota’s Tanner Morgan (No. 7), Indiana’s combo of Peyton Ramsey/Michael Penix Jr. (No. 12), Iowa’s Nate Stanley (No. 24), Wisconsin’s Jack Coan (No. 40) and Michigan’s Shea Patterson (No. 42.)</p>
<p>Pickett fared slightly better at sixth in the ACC behind Lawrence, North Carolina’s Sam Howell (No. 10), Wake Forest’s combo of Jamie Newman and Sam Hartman (No. 16), Virginia’s Bryce Perkins (No. 43) and Virginia Tech’s trio of Hendon Hookier, Ryan Willis and Quincy Patterson (No. 50.)</p>
<p>PFF’s overall grades weighed heavily in the ranking, as did&nbsp;“avoidance of negatively graded plays, the propensity for positively graded plays, the strength of competition and value towards a team victory.” Other factors considered include effect on a team’s offense, expected points added per dropback and overall accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
