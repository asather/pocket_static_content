<html><head><title>County seeks new air quality regulations to combat unhealthy smog</title></head><body><p>The Allegheny County Health Department announced Thursday it will seek new regulations to restrict industrial emissions during unhealthy, heavy smog conditions like the Pittsburgh region experienced in late December.</p><p>The health department initiative comes after a thick blanket of smog covered the region for six days, from Dec. 21 through Dec. 26</p><p>The smog, which boosted concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and fine airborne particles into the unhealthy category, was caused by a strong temperature inversion with no air movement that trapped pollution at ground level over a wide area.</p><p>It was the second “weather inversion” of 2019 and such inversions are expected to increase due to the changing climate.</p><p>“ACHD recognizes that the increasing frequency of these temperature inversions is associated with climate change. We also recognize that industry isn’t the only contributor to poor air quality as things like vehicle exhaust have a significant impact upon pollution,” said Ronald A. Sugar, the health department’s interim director, in a Thursday press release. “While we will continue to advocate for residents to do what they can to reduce emissions, we must also explore new regulations that would impose corrective action requirements on industry during short-term pollution events.</p><p>“These extended exceedances and higher pollution levels are a clear threat to the health of the county’s residents, but ACHD’s current regulations do not provide options to address this issue.”</p><p>The health department also said it will build a strong weather forecasting network to improve its ability to implement the new regulations and provide more timely public notification.</p><p>The ACHD also said it would work with local, state and federal officials to improve air quality in the region, including support for state legislation to increase fines for industrial facilities exceeding permitted emissions limits and requiring companies to notify communities if pollution control equipment rendered inoperable due to an accident.</p><p>Such an accident occurred on Dec. 24, 2018, when a massive fire knocked out the desulfurization equipment at U.S. Steel Corp.’s coke works in Clairton. Multiple exceedances of the sulfur dioxide emissions limit occurred following the fire as the steelmaker operated the coke making facility for 100 days without the pollution control system while repairs were made.</p><p>“The improvement of air quality in Allegheny County continues to be a high priority for ACHD,” Mr. Sugar said. “With innovative and forward-thinking policy solutions, we will continue to prioritize the health of the public and improve our communities.”</p><p><em>Don Hopey: dhopey@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1983.
