<h1>2020 NFL draft: Steelers add Anthony McFarland Jr., lineman Kevin Dotson in fourth round</h1>

<p><em><strong>This is a developing story and will be updated.</strong></em></p>
<p>The Steelers took running back Anthony McFarland Jr. of Maryland with the first of their two fourth-round selections in the NFL draft Friday, a move that will give them an instant injection of speed in their backfield.</p>
<p>Then they added a guard, Kevin Dotson of Louisiana-Lafayette (6-foot-4, 313 pounds), with their second pick in the round, adding some depth to a position that lost Ramon Foster and B.J. Finney.</p>
<p>McFarland (5-8, 208) was clocked at 4.44 at the NFL combine despite being bothered last season with a high-ankle sprain when he rushed for 614 yards and eight touchdowns.</p>
<p>He’s a good fit to the (running back) room, a good complement to what we have on the roster,” said Steelers running backs coach Eddie Faulkner. “He’s really explosive. He has shown the ability to hit the long ball. That’s a little change from what we got.”</p>
<p>McFarland played only two seasons at Maryland and rushed for 1,034 yards and averaged 7.9 yards per carry in 2018 as a redshirt freshman. But he got everybody’s attention when he rushed for 298 yards on 21 carries against Ohio State. McFarland had runs of 52, 75 and 81 yards in that game.</p>
<p>“The Ohio State game did a lot for my confidence, let me know I could still compete with the best,” McFarland said. “Not only that I can play football, but I can go toe-to-toe with the best.”</p>
<p>The Steelers coaches have familiarity with McFarland. Their new quarterback coach, Matt Canada, was Maryland’s offensive coordinator in 2018. Also, Mike Tomlin’s oldest son, Dino, played with the Terrapins last season.</p>
<p>“He’s kind of like a father figure to me,” McFarland said of Canada. “That means a lot to me. Every time I see Matt Canada I pick his brain. He’s going to let me know right from wrong.”</p>
<p>Injuries have bothered McFarland since high school. He missed his senior season at DeMatha Catholic and was redshirted his freshman season at Maryland because of a broken leg. He played only two seasons with the Terrapins, averaging 6.7 yards per carry in addition to catching 24 passes for 199 yards and one touchdown.</p>
