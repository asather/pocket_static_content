<h1>Local Scene: Donnie Iris weighs in on Isolation Jam cover of 'Ah! Leah!'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Can you cover “Ah! Leah” without doing dozens upon dozens of vocal overdubs?</p>
<p>Kay Hanley answers that in the affirmative with her faithful cover of Donnie Iris’ 1980 power-pop classic.</p>
<p>Working remotely with seven other musicians, the Letters to Cleo singer covered it for The Isolation Jams, a Socially Distanced Musical Collaborative organized by onetime Cleo drummer Tom Polce, with proceeds going to the MusicCares Covid 19 Relief Fund. There was a slight Pittsburgh connection to Boston’s Letters to Cleo, as the band’s original bassist, Scott Riebling, is the brother of Eric Riebling, who played bass in the Affordable Floors.</p>
<p>Hanley tweeted out the video, writing, “Your favorite 80s toxic love pop confection is now an Isolation Jams jam!”</p>

<p>Despite the social distancing, it’s a full-bodied cover that culminates in a synched guitar jam between Fernando Perdomo and Mike Powers.</p>
<p>“Rob James from The Clarks sent it to me,” Iris says.&nbsp;“Kay and the band killed it. Really nice touch with the harmonized guitar solo. I thought her vocals were spot on, not as layered as mine, but really nice. She had a cool, relaxed vibe in the verses, which I liked. I’m flattered.”</p>
<p>Iris says he can’t remember anyone else ever recording the song.</p>
<p>Asked how he’s holding up during the shutdown, Iris said,&nbsp;“I’m handling it as best I can. Really miss playing though. Miss my band and the fans.”</p>
<p>If you’re looking for him, you might find him on a golf course near Beaver Falls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Healing ballad</strong></p>
<p>Singer-songwriter Joel Lindsey brings some acoustic comfort to these COVID-19 days with the new song “The World Will Heal in Time.”</p>
<p>Lindsey, a British musician who moved here more than a decade ago and formed a band called Boulevard of the Allies, was inspired to write the plaintive folk ballad while watching his 2-year-old son Levi play in the backyard.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LKnaEuRzfd4" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>“He was pointing at what I thought were weeds but turned out to be mint,” Lindsey wrote. “My wife, Amy, had planted a small mint plant the year before and it had now grown along the fence, three meters across. I showed Levi how to pick it and enjoy the scent of the mint under his nose. As I watched him, I started to look around us at the emergence of spring; lilac and white blossoms on the trees, the grass growing tall, the bush leaves thickening and the wild onions popping up. Bees, birds, life. Since moving to Pittsburgh in 2007, spring has always been my favorite season. It's like a good, deep breath. I've always felt invigorated and refreshed at this time of year. The feeling you need after a long, grey winter. Looking around and then at my son, it occurred to me that this was the strangest, saddest, loneliest spring we had ever known.”</p>
<p>Lindsey recorded the song and accompanying video at home over 12 days and released it in mid April.</p>
<p>“Prior to this,” he wrote, “I've pondered songs for months and found it hard to complete anything. But I have had a lot swirling around my mind on the subject, so in one moment this song just poured out.”</p>
<p>Lindsey performed “The World Will Heal in Time” as part of his set for the Pittsburgh Irish Festival’s Live Stream Irish Music Series, which continues at 11 a.m. Saturday with Kiana June Weber and Martin Howley.</p>
