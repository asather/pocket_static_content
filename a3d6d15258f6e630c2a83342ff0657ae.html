<h1>Mt. Lebanon school board member uses profanity prior to meeting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mt. Lebanon school board member Michael Riemer, who was participating in a school board discussion meeting via Zoom on Monday, was unmuted prior to the official start of the meeting and could be heard by the public spouting a number of profanities.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, during which some board members attended in-person and some via Zoom, Mr. Riemer could be heard on the Zoom broadcast saying several profanities.</p>
<p>A few minutes after his comments, Mr. Riemer apologized for what he called a “hot mic.”</p>
<p>“I apologize for any crudeness that may have slipped out,” Mr. Riemer said, and added he was going through some things with his family.</p>
<p>Board President Sarah Olbrich responded to Mr. Riemer’s remarks with this statement: “To the community, I apologize for the behavior of Mr. Riemer tonight. His language was unacceptable and unbecoming his position. It will not happen again.”</p>
<p>The board later made a motion to censure Michael Riemer at its next meeting voting meeting on Sept. 22.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Board member Elaine Cappucci also condemned Mr. Riemer’s remarks.</p>
<p>“Whether that language was directed at the school community or, as he said, his family — either way it’s offensive,” she said.</p>
<p>Additionally, she pointed out that the board discussed a policy related to Title IX.</p>
<p>“This is particularly difficult for me as a female to hear words that were used from someone who may be voting on issues dealing with sexual harassment,” Ms. Cappucci said.</p>
<p>Later in the meeting, Mr. Riemer apologized again.</p>
<p>“I want to apologize for the extremely inappropriate language that I used this evening before the board meeting. There is no excuse for this egregious lapse of judgment. I deeply and sincerely apologize to our families, community members, District staff and my fellow board members for my behavior,” he said.</p>
<p>Parent Cindy Janay said of the incident during public comment, “I understand everyone has a bad day” and that she has been guilty of using profanity, “but I don’t do it in public.”</p>
<p>Mr. Riemer is a retired Mt. Lebanon police officer and worked as a school resource officer in the Mt. Lebanon district for several years prior to serving on the board.</p>
