<h1>Mike White's high school sports chat transcript: 02.25.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Semifinal week and then championships. To me, best week of the high school sports year. Electricity in gyms for semifinals is tremendous. So let's talk.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Tornado</strong>: Mike, what are your picks for the final 3 6A Boys hoops games? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Really great semis are at Robert Morris. Might be a really good crowd there tomorrow. Ethan Morton attracts fans. I'll take Lebo and Butler to have a championship rematch. Then Butler to win it all. Although I think USC-Butler is a tossup game.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Mike, haven’t been to a WPIAL playoff doubleheader in quite a while but want to go tonight or tomorrow: can you buy a ticket for both games and remain in gym after first one or do they empty it after first game? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, one ticket is good for both games. As of right now, they are not clearing any gyms out for second game. Although some of these doubleheaders really get crowded. At times, single game would be better.</p>
<p><strong>Lorenzo</strong>: Mike, was glad to see Coach Holzer and the USC team flex their muscles and show that strength of schedule and strength of wins matter all the way to the WPIAL Semifinals. What’s your prediction for the finals? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: See above. But wouldn't surprise me if USC won it. Will be interesting to see how USC plays Butler. USC likes to play full court and trap at times. Nothing is set on when they trap. Holzer lets it up to his players when to trap. Will they trap Morton?</p>
<p><strong>ballermode</strong>: What do you think Langston Moses from WT is going to do against OLSH tonight? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I'd say he is going to play. .... And OLSH is going to win.</p>
<p><strong>Ref show</strong>: Why didn't Peters Township try to hold the ball when they were up in regulation and the first OT. Seemed like they were lost in the late game situations? <br> <strong>basketball fan</strong>: mike, what do you think about class 4A boys semi- final and championship, 3 teams who got byes were eliminated in the quarterfinals besides #1 Highlands. a little surprising since QV,Knoch, and Uniontown were top teams in that class all year and section champs <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well basketball fan, I beg to differ. The only one that I would consider really surprising is Quaker Valley losing to Belle Vernon. But remember, QV starts three sophomores. They're young. Let's look at others. Uniontown's playoff woes strike again. Their section isn't strong and they just can't get past quarterfinals or semis. Blackhawk had defeated a number of good teams this year. Due to past, you really had to wonder how good Uniontown was again. As for Knoch, they tied Highlands for section title. But many wondered how good Knoch really was? Not a great non-section schedule. And look who beat Knoch: New Castle. Enough said.</p>
<p><strong>hoop junkie</strong>: 6A Semi-finals. RMU seats 4000. What are the chances it sells out? Its a double header of the biggest classification, Butler draws big everywhere and hoop fans of all types will come. Is that an overstatement to say it might sell out? (Tickets on line....$7 plus fees= $11 per head) <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Sorry, I have no idea if it will sell out. I don't work for ticket analytics. I have no idea how many tickets will sell. If you want to go and are worried about a sellout, drive to one of the participating schools and buy a ticket ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>Got it right...</strong>: I'd like to compliment the WPIAL on the seeding process for 6A. I was very skeptic of a few seeds- or at least one, but they were designed to get the 4 best teams in the Final Four and I truly believe that's what we have. PCC has great victories and definitely, deserves to be in the semi's... PCC is by far the best defensive team in 6A! We'll see if that trend continues... <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Central had some impressive wins in regular season. Not all that surprising they are in semis. But have to disagree in your assessment that 6A seedings were good. Many questioned how Fox Chapel could get No. 2 seed and USC No. 4 when USC beat Fox Chapel by 15 on final Friday night of regular season. Yes, Fox Chapel had only one loss, but the section was not strong and Foxes non-section schedule wasn't strong. USC had more impressive wins. I'm not bucking the WPIAL. Everyone gets it wrong sometimes. I think they got it wrong this time. Fox Chapel's section was 0-4 in playoffs and Fox Chapel scored only 30 some points in its game. I saw all four of top seeds play. I didn't think Fox Chapel was No. 2 seed. They were good but with what happened against USC I would not have given them No. 2 seed. WPIAL gets unfairly criticized many times but as USC coach Danny Holzer said, "The results speak for themselves."</p>
<p><strong>Farmer Rick</strong>: Mike when did WPIAL start the playoff tournament system? I can remember when I was in high school it didn’t exist and if it in 1968 two teams from my section Laurel Highlands and Uniontown would’ve probably been in the final. Laurel Highlands recent success brought back memories of that year. LH went all the way and won the state title, but a team from Uniontown tied them for a section title and a playoff game went to LH. Too bad their wasn’t a tournament then both teams would’ve been seated very high. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Farmer Rick, these definitely aren't the playoffs of the olden days. Yes, you used to have to win your section to even make the playoffs. If there was a tie for a section, there would be a one-game playoff to see who advanced. Heck, I remember in 1975 going to Civic Arena to watch B.B. Flenory and Valley play North Hills in a one-game playoff. This was just to decide the section champ. Imagine nowadays a section playoff at say PPG Paints? The late 1970s, early 1980s started taking more than section champ. But even by mid 1980s they were taking four teams from a section. So it's been a while.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Watching Rodney Gallagher of LH a few times he is certainly one of the most talented Freshmen to ever play in the WPIAL. I was wondering what your thoughts are on the freshmen and where you think he ranks all time as far as WPIAL freshmen? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well he was certainly one of the leading scorers as freshmen. Tom Pipkins, all time leading scorer, averaged in low 20s as a freshman. Of course, Aquinas Academy's VInnie Cugini averaged in 30s this year and he's a freshman. Rodney is definitely one of the best freshmen in a while. But remember. Sometimes a freshman might be really good, but might be behind a senior. Or hasn't physically matured yet. But yes, Gallagher has to be one of the best freshmen in WPIAL in at least few decades. His future? Honestly it depends on how much he grows.</p>
<p><strong>Stevie wonder</strong>: you think Josh Russell will play against butler? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You're talking about Upper St. Clair's Russell. I think he will get a few minutes. Coming back from injury.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: i want a fab five prediction mr mike <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: What you want and what you get are two different things.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: lebo vs central is going to be hard to watch they should use a shot clock <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Ha ha. But Lebo doesn't play that way. They will play fast paced. Lebo likes to press all over and they don't hold the ball. One of the keys to the game I think will be how well Central does against Lebo pressure and can Lebo speed up Central? Back in December, Central won 61-56. I hardly say that was a low-scoring game. I think this game might be higher scoring than you think.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan M.</strong>: Hey Mike, How tough of a match up will Belle Vernon be getting from New Castle? It seems like the Canes just out-tough everyone in the playoffs the last few years <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Obviously Belle Vernon has some talent. I have not seen them yet but Whitlock kid (20 ppg) is really good for a sophomore. New Castle has good young players, too. Let's not kid yourselves. Sure, Ralph Blundo does an amazing job, especially in postseason. But it's not like he hasn't had talent. On other hand, New Castle does always have tough kids and that helps come playoff time. But it helps when they're athletic also.</p>
<p><strong>6A fan</strong>: It's exciting that the 6A semis will be at RMU. From what you saw of the quarterfinals, any insight as to who will play at the Pete? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: See above. I'm taking Butler and Lebo. I'd say the USC game is a tossup. I'd probably make Lebo a 3-point fave.</p>
<p><strong>Lorenzo</strong>: Mike, I like the USC Panthers to win it all. Coach Holzer has cerebral meticulous approach to detail for every opponent the Panthers face. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Danny Holzer "cerebral meticulous?" Wow. I bet he doesn't even know what that means. But he has done a great job - and now Frankie Avalon gets to sit on bench at Robert Morris. Many people don't know or forget, he was an assistant at one time at Duquesne University under John Carroll. And who can forget that Holzer didn't just fold a college basketball program. He folded a college. He and Ron Richards were at Alliance College in Ohio. Not only did basketball program fold, the college closed.</p>
<p><strong>FC</strong>: Central Catholic is a good team, but Fox Chapel had a great season. Did the upset surprise you? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I've made the comment that I really don't consider it much of an upset. Maybe a tiny one. Some people do because of the seeds. But as I've said, Fox Chapel was good, but not overwhelming. Had tremendous season. But remember, Central beat Mt. Lebanon, Pine-Richland, Penn Hills in regular season. Should it be that surprising that Central beat Fox Chapel, when you consider everything? I think not. I had made the comment on our P-G This Week In High School Sports show that I didn't think Central had enough offense to beat Fox Chapel. Central didn't have great offense, but it was Fox Chapel that didn't have enough offense.</p>
<p><strong>Ref show</strong>: if you think Butler and Lebo meet in the championship game do you think the game earlier in the year that Butler won means anything? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Ron</strong>: How big a favorite is Highlands in 4A? Does NC or Belle vernon have the talent to matchup <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I'd say Highlands is the definite favorite. They are experienced and talented. But if they play New Castle, remember the New Castle pedigree. If Ralph Blundo wins it this year, they really should build a statue of him. But I think Highlands is the favorite.</p>
<p><strong>Off White</strong>: I saw the video from the PT v Butler game. It looked like Morton landed (and traveled) on the shot he made to send it into overtime. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I posted the video. I was courtside. Sure, it's easy when you run it back to say it looks like he might have landed before he shot. But that's an awfully tough play to call in real time. If he did land, it was by a hair. I saw it in real time. I couldn't tell. And would you make that call in that situation if you were not quite sure? No way.</p>
<p><strong>Stang Gang</strong>: Mike, it’s time for the WPIAL to realize it’s best player is Rodney Gallagher. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Please. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, Rodney Gallagher is very good especially for a freshman. But let's be serious. The best player in the WPIAL? C'mon, man.</p>
<p><strong>Off White</strong>: More of the same with private and Catholic schools being well represented in the semifinals. I get tired of the debate but I also get tired of the unfair playing field. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Wow this is really a new subject.</p>
<p><strong>Lorenzo</strong>: Mike, love this time of the year. Teams complain where they get seeded before playoffs get started, and end losing 1st game they play. There are teams that won 20 games that are sitting at home. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: People do like to complain. As I said, WPIAL unfairly criticized many times. But when you make seedings that are opinions, you have to expect complaints. Comes with the territory. Look at the NCAA.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: You think the seeding issue in Boys 6A was a case of the Hampton AD doing a little "I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine" in relationship to Fox Chapel ? Does the WPIAL make a change with that for the future ? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don't have back scratcher sources.</p>
<p><strong>Off White</strong>: What year did "Got it Right..." graduate from PCC? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: What in the world are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: why Shenango over Sto Rox? I know Sto rox is without there starting PG, but there way more athletic than Shenango <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Just a hunch. Sto-Rox is good but so is Shenango.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: give me fab 5 predictions <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You'll find out when we release the Fab 5 in April. And by the way, this is 40-year anniversary of Fab 5. We are planning some special things this year. We will announce the special things in a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>hoop junkie</strong>: Do you think the longer college court helps or hurts any of the teams playing at RMU? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well, it's not like it's 40 feet longer. If you face a pressing or trapping team like Mt. Lebanon or Upper St. Clair, it does give you a little more space to beat the traps. So maybe it gives just a tad help to Central and Butler.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: When determining the site locations for playoff games, does location to each team come in to play? To try to even out the proximity to each school. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Not always. Games are not equal distance. Never have been. What people don't sometimes realize is WPIAL doesn't have its pick of sites. Some schools don't want to host or aren't equipped to host. But even I have to admit that sometimes I'm scratching my head trying to figure out a few.</p>
<p><strong>Ref show</strong>: Butler beat USC last year in the playoffs if i remember correctly. How different are the teams this year and do you think that means anything for tomorrows game? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes Butler beat Upper St. Clair in quarterfinals. A lot of the game players are back but a year older and hopefully better. But I don't think last year's game will have any bearing on this year.</p>
<p><strong>Beaver County is for Lovers</strong>: Mike, who do you like in the girls 3A semi-finals tomorrow night? Could have almost been 4 teams all from section 1 in that semi-final. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Beaver and Mohawk.</p>
<p><strong>Got it right...</strong>: How many 6A teams will be playing 5A next year? And any 5A team going to 6A? I hear New Castle is heading to 5A... Any truth to this? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Latrobe and Connellsville will be 5A next year. Yes, New Castle will be 5A.</p>
<p><strong>Phog Allen</strong>: Mike - I think that Belle Vernon will trip up New Castle. Joe Salvino's teams always seem to play hard. If they do get past New Castle, who do you think the Leopards would face in the championship game? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Highlands.</p>
<p><strong>Phog Allen</strong>: Does Hickory have a prayer of a chance against South Bend Central? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Not unless Jimmy Chitwood plays.</p>
<p><strong>fat boy</strong>: Do you know what I miss? The days when teams would do the tip drill in warm ups. These days it looks like everyone is practicing before a game. However, I do like that shorts are becoming short again. By the way... get off my lawn! <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Ha ha. I still see a few teams do the tip drill. I think they need to do it with a multi-colored ball. But hey, I've seen Latrobe have striped warmup pants. And I noticed Peters Township had red and white striped warmup pants other day. I love that. Old school stuff. But even I have to admit that I wonder if warmup pants are really necessary? So what. I still like to see them. Used to be that everyone had them.</p>
<p><strong>Change it</strong>: The 2-3-4 seeds that lost in 4A boys, Fox Chapel in 6A and Penn Hills in 5A had to wait almost two weeks to play their games. District 6 settled championships this week and Greater Johnstown and Huntingdon will wait 13 days to play a PIAA game. Meanwhile District 12 went straight from Public/Catholic playoffs to seed in games Districts 1 and 3 are running concurrent consolation tournament. You've got to PLAY basketball and not scrimmage and practice to be sharp. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don't disagree with you. And the "sitting" is a subject coaches often talk about. It's not a good system. I don't know what the answer is unless you let regular season go longer and crunch playoffs into shorter times. But there are many things involved in that. But I agree the "sitting" for two weeks is not good. Wish it wasn't that way.</p>
<p><strong>Lorenzo</strong>: Mike, do you factor in how far a star player takes his team in the playoffs when choosing the Fab 5? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>San Juan Og</strong>: Bishop Boyle 1982 Best of all Time <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Oh without a doubt. Better than 65 Midland, 67 Ambridge and all the others. Chago, Rivera, Masley.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: We all know that Ethan Morton is great but who do you see being the most impactful player on USC? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Can't really say because USC is so balanced and they usually have five players on the floor that can maybe beat you off the dribble. Gensler is leading scorer, but he is most impactful? I don't think you can make that call. Pantelis does things. Heck, Dahlem is really important. Then there's Casey. Will be interesting to see what happens against Butler because Butler plays mostly zone.</p>
<p><strong>colts fan</strong>: predections for tomorrows CV TJ girls match up <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Hey TJ can win. Char Valley needed a controversial buzzer beater last time to beat TJ. That said, I can't go against a team that has won 52 in a row. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well that's it for now. Go out to a game this week. It's good stuff.</p>
