<h1>As end of Pa.'s eviction moratorium looms Friday, advocates promote aid for renters and landlords</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Friday is the last day <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/05/07/Pa-will-extend-eviction-foreclosure-protections-to-July-10-covid-19/stories/202005070135?cid=search" target="_blank">a statewide, temporary halt on evictions is in effect</a> — and advocates fear that when the moratorium ends, it could bring a wave of evictions, putting people out of their homes amid the still-ongoing pandemic. Tenants in some federally-subsidized properties are protected until July 25.</p>
<p>“We're really expecting a flood of these [eviction filings],” said Megan Stanley, director of Pittsburgh's Commission on Human Relations, based on trends in past court filings.</p>
<p>Housing advocates are particularly concerned because evictions can result in a host of problems: tenants can wind up being homeless, as well as unable to find stable housing in the future because of the eviction filing against them.</p>
<p>And that's not to mention the potential impacts during a pandemic when people are urged to stay at home as much as possible.</p>
<p>“I can't imagine people being evicted and becoming homeless in a pandemic. That means they won't be able to wash their hands. They won't be able to do anything that's required to keep you healthy through this whole situation,” said Carol Hardeman, program director at the Hill District Consensus Group, who has been working to help those in danger of losing their housing.</p>
<p>Renters and landlords in need of assistance can apply for funds through the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, but it is not clear if the $150 million in federal aid that has been allocated will be enough to help everyone in need or if it can be available quickly enough. An additional $25 million is available for homeowners seeking mortgage aid.</p>
<p>The agency started taking applications Monday.</p>
<p>“Everything we are hearing...is that it's going to be some time before the money actually starts to flow under this program, whether it's a week or two or three,” said Kevin Quisenberry, litigation director at the Community Justice Project, which is working to connect tenants to the federal funds available, as well as some other resources.</p>
<p>While emphasizing she was not criticizing any organization administering the program, Phyllis Chamberlain, executive director of the Housing Alliance of Pennsylvania, noted, “It's a massive program administered in all 67 counties.... I just don't see how it's possible to get the funds into the hands of people in need by Friday.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>That possible delay has some calling for the moratorium to be extended.</p>
<p>“[W]e believe additional time is needed to ensure that payments from the program are made prior to the expiration of the moratorium,” state Senate Democrats wrote in a letter to Gov. Tom Wolf earlier this month. “Any delay in receiving payments from the program could potentially lead to mortgage companies and landlords beginning the foreclosure or eviction process while an application for assistance is pending with a county or PHFA.”</p>
<p>A Pittsburgh City Council proclamation on Tuesday also urged the governor to extend the moratorium until Aug. 31. On Tuesday, Allegheny County Council members also voted to urge the courts to extend the moratorium until Dec. 1.</p>
<p>Also of concern to housing advocates as the moratorium lifts: the state's <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/06/30/Good-news-jobs-Pittsburgh-May-unemployment-rate-13-7-percent/stories/202006300101?cid=search" target="_blank">unemployment rate remains high — at 13.7% in May for Pittsburgh and the surrounding region</a> — and enhanced unemployment compensation that gave jobless workers an extra $600 weekly will stop at the end of this month unless Congress acts.</p>
<p>And many are already struggling. A survey by Apartment List showed three in 10 Americans — both renters and homeowners — missed housing payments in June. Though many of those were made up by the end of the month, a late payment can still indicate financial trouble.</p>
<p>Marylynn Orlando, CEO of the PA Apartment Association, which represents larger landlords with multiple multi-unit apartments, said she doesn’t anticipate an initial wave of evictions because many of the apartment owners in the association have been working with any residents who are having difficulties.</p>
<p>“July collections are almost back to pre-COVID percentages,” she said, though what happens at the end of the month when the enhanced unemployment ends is a bit of an unknown, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jane Downing, a senior program officer at The Pittsburgh Foundation, who has been studying evictions locally for several years, said she is hopeful some recent changes, such as a mediation program for landlords and tenants through the city’s Human Relations Commission, might be able to mitigate a potential tidal wave of evictions.</p>
<p>However, she said she is concerned that the funds available for tenant assistance might not be enough to help everyone who needs it.</p>
<p>“I think we honestly have no idea of how many filings will be made,” she said.</p>
<p>Research by Ms. Downing and the foundation count about 1,000 filings per month in Allegheny County on average in a normal year.</p>
<p>“And this isn't a normal year,” she said.</p>
