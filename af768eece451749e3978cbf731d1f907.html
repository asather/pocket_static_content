<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A New Kensington man was arrested Monday evening after police say he wielded a knife while trying to rob a Port Authority police officer in Downtown Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Aaron Walker, 26, is charged with robbery, access device fraud, possessing instruments of crime, criminal mischief, receiving stolen property and public drunkenness. He attempted to rob the officer, who was in plain clothes, around 6 p.m. at Fifth Avenue and Wood Street, a criminal complaint said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Walker approached the officer while holding a black knife in one hand as he asked,&nbsp;“Give me five bucks and a cigarette,” the complaint said. The officer asked him why he had a knife and told him he did not have anything to give, as Mr. Walker continued to probe him for money.</p>
<p>Eventually, Mr. Walker walked away, but was arrested soon after by Port Authority police in Katz Plaza at 7th Street and Penn Avenue after they followed him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the knife, officers also found a stolen bank card from another individual in Mr. Walker’s possession.</p>
<p>Police said Mr. Walker had approached them several times previously Downtown, asking for drugs or money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for Feb. 6.</p>
