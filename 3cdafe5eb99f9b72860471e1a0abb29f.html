<h1>Penguins mailbag: Who would have the most success in another sport?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome back to Mike’s Mailbag.&nbsp;</em><em>We’ve now reached two months without hockey. Hope you’re all staying safe and sane. This week, we’ll be talking about hockey players hitting homers, our old friend Marc-Andre Fleury, why the NHL doesn’t just cancel the season and very good dogs. Let’s jump right in.</em></p>
<p><strong>John A.:</strong> I’ve been watching “The Last Dance” documentary on Michael Jordan. The last episode was about him playing baseball. Which Penguin would have the most success in another sport?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>It’s got to be Sidney Crosby, right? Not only is he a freak athlete, but he’s a perfectionist who would put in as much work as possible. There’s even video on YouTube of him hitting a home run at PNC Park. He’d make a nice addition the the Pirates ... at least until he was traded for “financial flexibility” or something.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rich S.:</strong> If the season does resume, what kind of impact do you think it will have on the Penguins?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> There are two ways to look at this layoff. On one hand, a veteran team like the Penguins might take longer to get back in gear after prolonged time away from the ice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But on the other side of it, look at where the Penguins were when the season was suspended. They had lost eight of 11 games. Stars on the top lines were overtaxed (not to mention Crosby was only a few months removed from significant surgery). And a bunch of newly acquired players were still trying to find where they fit.</p>
<p>This break should give the Penguins some time to regroup, the veterans some rest and — most significantly — Jake Guentzel will almost certainly be back. Speaking of Guentzel…</p>
<p><strong>Bdockjohn25:</strong> What is [the] time table for Jake Guentzel’s return?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Here’s the bottom line: If the NHL comes back this season, I’d expect Guentzel to eventually do the same.</p>
<p>As a reminder, here’s the timeline. Guentzel crashed into the boards Dec. 30 and underwent surgery soon after. The Penguins estimated he’d miss four to six months. May 1 marked the four months. July 1 will be six.</p>
<p>All indications from coach Mike Sullivan and general manager Jim Rutherford are that Guentzel is on track. Even if the NHL decided tomorrow to let players skate, it would likely give them three or four weeks to ramp up. So by the time the NHL comes back, it will nearly be six months since the injury — maybe longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lisa N.:</strong> If the Pens had kept Fleury over Murray, do you think Fleury would be as beloved as he is today? People forget how hard fans were on Fleury from 2010-2015, and many wanted him replaced.</p>
<p><strong>Mike: </strong>You bring up a good point.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Right now, most Penguins fans love Fleury’s affable personality, his three rings and all those highlight-reel saves. But during some shaky playoff performances, a chunk of fans seemed to turn on Fleury. Maybe it was just a vocal minority. Maybe it was more than that.</p>
<p>I’d say it would come down to performance. Look at what happened at PPG Paints Arena on&nbsp;Jan. 19 win. A group of fans gave Matt Murray <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2020/01/19/Ron-Cook-Penguins-Boston-Bruins-goalie-Matt-Murray-Sidney-Crosby-Mario-Lemieux-sellout-streak/stories/202001200041" target="_blank">the Bronx cheer treatment</a>&nbsp;after he let up two goals on the first three shots. As our Ron Cook pointed out, no one seemed to care that he was huge during those back-to-back Cup runs. Even in Vegas, fans weren’t happy with Fleury last postseason. Maybe it’s a blessing in a weird that Penguins fans can bask in the nostalgia and admire Fleury’s antics from afar.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Don:</strong> At this point, why doesn’t the NHL just cancel the season and look ahead to 2020-21? How long can they possibly keep players in limbo?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I get where you’re coming from, Don. I sometimes think the same thing. But a couple key factors are at play.</p>
<p>Financially, the NHL has hundreds of millions of reasons to come back this summer. ESPN reported that if the NHL doesn’t complete the regular season, it will leave $150 million on the table. Even more cash money will be lost if the postseason gets canceled.</p>
<p>This loss of potential revenue hits more than just billionaire owners and millionaire players. This week, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/12/Pittsburgh-Penguins-unpaid-leave-of-absence-program-COVID-19-pandemic-David-Morehouse/stories/202005120156" target="_blank">Penguins announced four-month furloughs</a> for some of their employees. It’s a huge bummer. Many of the people affected are good people and friends. But like any business, when the spigot gets turned off, at some point tough decisions have to be made.</p>
<p>On top of that, the sports world might be working with a limited window to play games. I’m not going to pretend to be an expert. Everyone should think twice before getting information about the virus from someone who spends most of his job talking about a power play. With that said, some of the stories I’ve read say there’s a possibility of a second wave of COVID-19 hitting in the fall. Let’s hope not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, at a minimum, the NHL needs to consider that possibility and try to award a Cup this summer while they can.</p>
<p><strong>Frank:</strong> This downtime has given me a chance to dig through some old sports memorabilia. What’s your favorite piece of memorabilia?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> When I was about 12 or 13, I was super into collecting baseball cards. My dad went to this card shop in Latrobe that was closing down. The little old lady who owned the place got her purse and pulled out a Roberto Clemente rookie card that she’d been carrying around everywhere for decades. My dad gave it to me one birthday. That’s got to be at the top of my list.</p>
<p>Another somewhat bizarre piece of memorabilia is a program from the game that never happened at Heinz Field. If you remember, the Steelers were scheduled to host the Cleveland Browns to open their new stadium. But 9/11 forced the NFL to cancel all Week 2 games. I went to one of the first games that season and bought one of the programs from what was supposed to be the first game.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> I’m thinking of getting a dog. Is this a good idea and what is a good dog name based on a Penguins player?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Getting a dog is a great idea. If possible, I’d recommend rescuing one. Not for any moral reasons or anything, but just because I love when people use that word “rescue.” It’s like this dog was tied to the train tracks with a two-ton locomotive barreling toward it. And, boom, there you were, riding on horseback to free your beloved pooch just in the nick of time. Everyone will think of you as a real hero.</p>
<p>When it comes to a Pittsburgh-themed dog name, Crosby is a good go-to. I wrote a story earlier this year about <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/02/pittsburgh-penguins-sidney-crosby-baby-names/stories/202001270087" target="_blank">people who have even named their kids after Sid.</a> Fleury also would make a great dog name. Geno isn’t bad either, although you might have to teach him commands in Russian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
