<h1>Analysis: Does it really make sense for the Pirates to sign Yasiel Puig?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It has become the Pirates’ version of Jameis Winston, the possible player acquisition that has mobilized a fan base, the longest of shots on the surface but also not a completely ridiculous idea.</p>
<p>Should the Pirates, whose biggest offseason acquisition to this point has been 35-year-old center fielder Jarrod Dyson for $2 million, really sign Yasiel Puig as a free agent for this truncated, 60-game season?</p>
<p>The acquisition of Puig certainly makes some modicum of sense, but it’s also not terribly likely given the Pirates’ recent track record of signing notable free agents — in that they don’t have much of one.</p>
<p>What follows is a point-counterpoint argument, an exercise designed to look at whether the Pirates should indeed ink the enigmatic outfielder once nicknamed “The Wild Horse” and why maybe it’s a little far-fetched to think that they ever would.</p>
<p><strong>Point:</strong> Puig may be seen as the perfect “buy low” option.</p>
<p>It’s June 26. Spring training 2.0 starts next week. Time’s running out. Sure, Puig might’ve wanted $8-$10 million this offseason, but he’s not going to get it.</p>
<p>Much has been made about some of Puig’s “fancy stats,” with a 1.2 WAR and 101 wRC+ serving as his lowest such marks since 2016, when he was demoted to Class AAA.</p>
<p>But traditionally, Puig slashed .267/.327/.458 with 24 home runs, 30 doubles and 76 runs while also setting career-highs in RBIs (84) and stolen bases (19).</p>
<p>While those numbers might be criticized other places, that wouldn’t happen here. Pirates fans would be thrilled to see Puig have a season like that.</p>
<p>(Note: You’ll want to know wRC+ or — Weighted Runs Created Plus. It’s a Bill James-type stat aimed at expressing a player’s value via runs, where 100 is seen as the league average.)</p>
<p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Yeah, some might be able to spin the narrative that Puig had a down year, but how “low” are we talking about here?</p>
<p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, Puig was projected to make $8 million on his next contract, according to MLB Trade Rumors. It was also reported this winter that Puig turned down a $10 million deal from a team believed to be the Miami Marlins.</p>
<p>Do you really think the Pirates are going to pay anywhere near that?</p>
<p>Chris Archer was slated to make $9 million in a full season, Gregory Polanco $8.6 million and Josh Bell $4.8 million.</p>
<p>Unless a shortened season comes with coupons, forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>Point:</strong> Puig is long overdue for a bounce-back year, one that harkens back to when he defected from Cuba and tore up the league by hitting .319 with a .925 OPS in 2013, finishing second in NL Rookie of the Year voting.</p>
<p>That year and the next, Puig was incredible. He was an All-Star in 2014 and appeared in 148 games for the Dodgers, with 37 doubles, nine triples and a career-high 268 total bases.</p>
<p>There have been some leaner years since, but Puig has also been hurt, experiencing several hamstring and hip issues. Finally, those are behind him. Puig is ready.</p>
<p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Puig’s best years are probably behind him.</p>
<p>The 2019 season offered an interesting parallel to 2013 for Puig. His strikeout rate in 2019 (21.8%) was the second-highest of his career behind his rookie season (22.5%), but Puig saw his on-base percentage dip from .391 as a rookie to .327 in 2019.</p>
<p>This happened while Puig saw 60.1% fastballs in 2019, up from 54.4% as a rookie. Puig also saw his batting average on fastballs, according to Statcast, drop from .345 in 2013 to .270 in 2019.</p>
<p>Both are indications that, at 29, his bat speed could be slowing down.</p>
<p><strong>Point:</strong> Puig would offer an upgrade in right field.</p>
<p>Defensively, that’s probably true. Since 2013, Puig ranked 13th among qualified outfielders according to FanGraphs when it comes to Defensive Runs Saved (28). Polanco has been worth just five.</p>
<p>When it comes to throwing, Puig has been one of the best throwing outfielders since 2013. A good way to quantify this is with a statistic known as rARM — or Outfield Arm Runs Saved.</p>
<p>It basically seeks to show how often runners advance on base hits and are thrown out trying to take extra bases.</p>
<p>Only Starling Marte, Eddie Rosario and Alex Gordon have fared better than Puig among qualifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Puig may not be all that different from Polanco.</p>
<p>An interesting area to examine here involves how Puig has fared against left-handed pitching over the past three years, with Puig producing a slash line of .225/.314/.359 and a wRC+ of 79.</p>
<p>By comparison, Polanco — who many Pirates fans would be quick to tell you fares horribly against lefties — has actually been better, slashing .239/.307/.386 with a wRC+ of 87.</p>
<p>Now, you could sit Puig and Polanco against left-handers and play Guillermo Heredia, who has a career OPS of .737 against them compared to .596 against right-handers, but then you’re turning one of your highest-paid players into a platoon guy.</p>
<p>Oh, and defensively, Puig doesn’t cover much ground. Less than Polanco, actually.</p>
<p>Puig’s UZR/150 — a solid, all-encompassing defensive statistic that measures a player’s performance over 150 innings, theoretically evening out sample size — of 2.6 is actually worse than that of Polanco (2.9).</p>
<p>Puig also had the lowest fielding percentage among all major league right fielders in 2018 at .958.</p>
<p><strong>Point:</strong> The acquisition of Puig might make sense from a business standpoint.</p>
<p>If all goes well, sure. There will be a trade deadline on Aug. 31, and Puig — if he performs — could likely be flipped to a contender for prospects, assuming the Pirates are not in the division race at that point.</p>
<p>But what if he stinks? The Pirates, who just laid off dozens of business-side employees, will have wasted money on a superfluous addition, one that runs counter to everything they’ve done up until this point.</p>
<p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Yeah, that.</p>
<p>Since general manager Ben Cherington took over, look at his moves: Heredia, Luke Maile, JT Riddle, Derek Holland, Robbie Erlin. Does the next one there scream Puig?</p>
<p>Cherington has spoken at length about charting a sustained path toward winning, about making sure this franchise is built better long-term. It’s reasonable, too, as the Pirates were unable to keep air in the balloon for long enough after making the playoffs three straight years in 2013-15.</p>
<p>But signing Puig would be an outlier and a gigantic one at that.</p>
<p><strong>Point:</strong> Puig would serve as an olive branch from Pirates ownership to its fans, a demonstration that they’re going for it all in a shortened season where anything can happen, a reason to make them care about the team again.</p>
<p>That is true. In 60 games, get ready to expect the unexpected.</p>
<p>And who better than the fun-loving Puig to reconnect a city with its baseball team, right? In a clubhouse that skews quiet, the result of having such a young club, Puig would liven things up and give it a jolt of personality.</p>
<p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> A troubled past may make Puig a (personality) risk not worth taking.</p>
<p>And not just with the Pirates, either, although that certainly exists. (Did you forget Puig trying to fight the entire Pirates team in April 2019, then re-igniting the brawl in Cincinnati two months later by going after Kyle Crick?)</p>
<p>Puig sporting a blonde mohawk might be fun, but he could also become a Derek Bell-sized problem.</p>
<p>After all, we’re talking about a player here who has rankled fans and teammates alike for showing up late to work, dogging it, lacking accountability, driving recklessly and coming off as a malcontent/uncoachable.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s garbage, but what if it isn’t? Is that the sort of stuff the Pirates would want around a young team?</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> While seeing Puig in Pittsburgh would be a boatload of fun, there’s simply not enough here to justify the expense, especially when it comes to a team like the Pirates.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, Puig actually wants to play here. Then all bets are off.</p>
