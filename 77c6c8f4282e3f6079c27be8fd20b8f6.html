<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 01.13.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi, everyone. Thanks for coming round for another chat, even though the Steelers haven't made much news since last we talked. But I'm sure there's still plenty on your mind. Do what you do...</p>
<p><strong>Ken</strong>: Blue print provided by Tennessee for beating the Ravens next year? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Kind of hard to say, Ken. I mean, sure, rushing for 200+ yards, winning the turnover battle 3-0 and getting two absurd touchdown catchse is a pretty good formula to follow. But yeah, if it's more about how they did it, they were determined to keep Lamar Jackson from gashing them down the middle. Good plan, but tougher to execute. To me, the biggest thing they're doing on this run is just showing how crucial it is to have a ground game.</p>
<p><strong>Watt-age</strong>: After watching the games this past weekend it was clear that winning the line of scrimmage is essential to winning football. With this the Steelers must prioritize oline and dline players in FA and draft. I don’t see a case for other needs above these. What say U? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The case would just be that the Steelers believe they already have the horses in-house to improve their line play. Zach Banner or Chuks Okorafor at OL (both tackles). Tyson Alualu as someone still capable of being a stop-gap option, and then the development of Isaiah Buggs at DL. I'm not necessarily saying I agree with that, but those would be the arguments against "prioritizing" those spots over, say, skill position players.</p>
<p><strong>jds317</strong>: It seems that the Steelers brain trust is managing behind the league trends. In 2015-2018, teams were short pass oriented featuring backs and tight ends. Teams altered their defenses with fast LB's to offset that trend. Then in 18 the Pats rolled thru the playoffs to a SB win with a power run game. Now the successful teams are power run game and mobile QB. The Steelers are behind trend with an OL that can't run block and no feature back. Their passing game has a QB coming off surgery and no AB type game changer at WR. The defense went light and fast (D.Bush) and got exposed against the run at the end of 19. Is it time to retool both offense and the D or is it too late? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: At a certain point, it's just about doing what you do better than the other guys do what they do. Last I checked, the wide-open, pass-happy style of the Chiefs is working just fine. It surely helps when you have Pat Mahomes, just as it helps a run-based system when you have Derrick Henry. I'd be skeptical of the Steelers "retooling" - or completely rethinking - their approach on offense when Ben Roethlisberger is still the QB, and on defense when you look at what they've invested to build the current unit (which is quite good, by the way).</p>
<p><strong>livinthedream</strong>: Brian, With the NFL trending towards the run instead of paying 17 mil for Bud why not spend 10 mil on Cory Littleton. With Cory and devin <br> <strong>livinthedream</strong>: In the middle of the Steelers D the steelers will have one of the best run Ds in the NFL and 6 or 7 mil to spend on other spots. And if Vince can put on 10 pounds of muscle he can move to the outside. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Because you still need to be able to rush the passer, and it's not as if Bud Dupree was bad against the run. He was actually fairly stout from his edge, recording 36 tackles against the run, by far a career high for him and third on the team. You have some interesting ideas, though. I do think the Steelers will need to do some no-stones-unturned evaluation about the ILB spot moving forward, personnel-wise.</p>
<p><strong>GeorgiaSteeler</strong>: Brian, Steeler fans since Bill Austin/John Henry Johnson days. I hope I'm wrong but I think the Steelers golden years are gone for the next 5-7 years. At least I was in Tampa for the last Super Bowl win. Keep writing theses good articles. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thanks, GeorgiaSteeler. On paper, I can see why you or anyone else would feel that way, but let's give a nod to the Steelers culture, not just under Mike Tomlin but even going back to newly minted Hall of Famer Bill Cowher and of course Chuck Noll before him. There's something to be said for tradition and lineage. Granted, the post-Ben era will be the biggest test of that yet.</p>

<p><strong>RJT</strong>: Why do the Steelers always throw deep on third and short? Why not just get the first down? Drives me nuts. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They rushed 15 times and passed 43 times on third-and-3 or less. Probably because they couldn't get much push with their OL all season long.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry</strong>: What do you think about Najee Harris as our 2nd round pick? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think he would be better than Najeh Davenport. But seriously, the 6-2 230-pound junior RB from Alabama hasn't actually declared for the draft yet. He's a beast, though, so I feel like he will. I don't know about using your first pick on a running back, but he'd be tough to pass on. Big fan of his game.</p>
<p><strong>JP</strong>: Would it make sense to trade DuPree for a 1st round pick? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nah, what I would do if I were the Steelers is trade my 2021 first-round pick to move back into the first round in this draft. And then next year I would trade my 2022 first-round pick to move back up in the 2021 draft, and so on and so forth. My plan would be to keep doing that until the NFL folds.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph</strong>: Do you agree the Steelers need coaching help at offensive line (can't run block) and the quarterback coaching position. Of course all offensive changes must be o.k. with Ben. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah I'd say it wasn't a great maiden voyage for Shaun Sarrett as OL coach, but of course I'm only basing that on their play/production. It's not like I was in the meeting rooms to see what he was teaching or on the sideline to hear what adjustments he was making. Hiring a QB coach wouldn't be a bad idea at all. Especially when the NFL doesn't have staff size limits.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Medium Chest</strong>: Hi Brian, i feel Mr Tomlin is a very good coach and motivator but i dont get the sense that he is a great X’s &amp; O’s &amp; scheme guy. I think he gets players to play hard and believe in the cause. I feel he would benefit from more established coordinators such as a Wade Phillips etc. Do you feel the Steelers can win a SB with Randy F and Butler, i dont see it. Thank you <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yes I do, mostly because I still believe it's more about the Jimmy's and Joe's. It's funny, a lot of folks usually criticize the Steelers for having coordinators who are too old rather than young and innovative.</p>
<p><strong>Doug from Raleigh</strong>: Reason(s) for Baltimore losing? Rust due to layoff, overconfidence, lack of poise, poor coaching? They didn't respond like KC to adversity, and seemed to think Lamar could beat Tennessee single handed. Thoughts, good sir? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi, Doug. The Ravens turned the ball over themselves and couldn't get any from the Titans. That will flip the script on any good team. Also, let's give the Titans some credit. The TD catches by Jonnu Smith and *checks notes* Kalif Raymond were sensational. And I'm not sure it was bad coaching by John Harbaugh as much as it was a great game plan and execution by Mike Vrabel. The paper down in Nashville does a report card like we do, and he got an A++. Hard to argue with that.</p>
<p><strong>VAsteelersFan</strong>: Hi BB . . . would you say questions regarding how "hot" someone's "seat" is qualify as the most obnoxious (and cliched) metaphor you see in your chats? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, they're up there. Questions about most obnoxious questions, though? Love those.</p>
<p><strong>db</strong>: Will Hines Ward be the new WR coach? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The guess here is no, but it would be a great story. Bill Cowher agrees with me <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/09/30/bill-cowher-hall-of-honor-steelers-hines-ward-coaching/stories/201909300166" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/09/30/bill-cowher-ha...</a></p>
<p><strong>YinzerinVA</strong>: What are the chances that the Steelers bring in Teddy Bridgewater or another veteran QB? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thirty-six%</p>
<p><strong>Artie Bridge</strong>: I keep reading that this year's draft is thin in tight ends. Who are some leading free agent te's, and who could the Steelers afford? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I actually kinda like this crop of tight ends, or at least the depth of it if not elite talent. And the depth could be what helps the Steelers if one of the better ones falls to the second round. The 2020 free agent class is very shaky. Basically every guy is either aging or injury prone. Vernon Davis, Jason Witten, Eric Ebron, Tyler Eifert, Charles Clay. The two best options are Hunter Henry and Austin Hooper, and I'm surprised the Chargers and Falcons haven't re-signed those guys yet.</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: don't you think ben is done? he looks like he weighs 300 lbs, he only won 4 playoff games in 11 years and his constant distractions about other players hasn't help the locker room !!!! they need to cut ties with this selfish player, after all, its all about him !!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>KB</strong>: Would it be crazy to trade Tuitt ( expensive and oft injured) for a #3 or 4, sign Hargrave (for less than Tuitt) to take his place on the outside, and use the savings to sign Dupree long term? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Crazy? No. But I still wouldn't do it. Not after the year Stephon Tuitt was having and the type of injury that sidelined him. Lots of guys have come back just fine from those torn pecs.</p>
<p><strong>AS</strong>: Why is it that some people think that ILBs and OLBs are interchangeable. They’re totally different positions. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They are, but I think the previous questioner was drawing on the idea that Vince Williams' best strength is his pass-rushing/</p>
<p><strong>Titan In Charlotte</strong>: Hey Brian, Bigger news Ravens losing to Titans or Butler pulling out of the WPIAL in football? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Titans losing, by a hair. But Joe Starkey asked me about this last week on The Fan, and I'll say this about Butler football leaving the WPIAL, it's hard to fault them given their enrollment situation. As a Shaler grad who witnessed his alma mater endure a seasons-long losing streak a few years ago, one of the biggest factors in their turnaround was dropping from 6A to 5A. And it's not as if the Titans are winning WPIAL titles or anything, but they're making the playoffs and winning about half their games, and that seems a long way off for Butler.</p>

<p><strong>OHIO412FAN</strong>: Brian, thanks for doing the chats! Appreciate you doing them. Anyways, is there any way possible the Steelers could retain Dupree and Hargrave? I know they’ll be more likely to keep one, but would they have to do to make that happen? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thanks! They'd have to shed a lot of cap space by cutting guys still under contract, and even then, they might have to get Javon Hargrave to settle for less than he'll be worth on the open market. There always seems to be a way to make it work, but it would take getting pretty creative to make your wish come true.</p>
<p><strong>j davenjay</strong>: A solid offensive line is paramount and is the key for a good running game and play action passes. Our receivers did not get separation from the defenders this year and the QBs were constantly under pressure. A talented offensive line that can run and pass block is the key with a reliable running back and speedy receiver. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yes, and the Steelers used play action less than any team this season, by a fairly wide margin. But hey, every team out there is trying to assemble a talented offensive line that can run and pass block, a reliable running back and a speedy wideout. The other front offices get paid to do this, too.</p>
<p><strong>Smilin Jack Lambert</strong>: I like the college OT format, but with one change - you must go for 2 if you score a TD. Do you think that could work in the NFL? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Actually, yes, I would prefer the college format to how the NFL does it. Just think it would be a lot more enjoyable, but I know the traditionalists would hate it.</p>
<p><strong>Lloyd's 3-Count</strong>: Hey B. What was your biggest surprise covering the Steelers in your first year? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nothing too surprising. I guess maybe how challenging it can be to report on this league. For the most part, coaches and players are savvy enough to know what you're getting at with a question and how to avoid it, if they choose to. Obviously, not every guy is like that, but I found myself at times trying to think of the best way to ask something to Mike Tomlin that would produce a useful answer.</p>
<p><strong>James Conner </strong>: Any chance of me being traded in order for the Black ‘n’ Gold to move up in the draft? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sorry, but doubtful</p>
<p><strong>rman</strong>: Hello Brian, As I've watched the playoff games over the past two weekends it seems to me that there is a big difference in the way that the games are being officiated in comparison to the regular season. Less holding calls on both offense and defense....hands to the face not being called too often..etc. The games seem much more enjoyable to watch. What is your take on this? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Can't say I've really noticed that, rman, but then again, I'm not watching these games as closely as the ones I cover.</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville </strong>: Hi Brian...Strange question. The Steelers for years have always had a high-profile succession plan. The Chief to Dan to Art II. That doesn’t seem to be the case right now. God forbid something would happen to Art II today, who would actually run the organization on a day-to-day basis? Would it be Danny Rooney? If so, why is he not more visible in the operation of the team? Also, why haven’t the wives been considered? Thanks! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Art II's son Danny Rooney has been considered the heir apparent for years now. I'd recommend reading this story from our Ray Fittipaldo a few seasons back <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/steelers/2016-preview/heir-apparent/" target="_blank">https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/steelers/2016-preview/heir-ap...</a></p>
<p><strong>Franco</strong>: I know you were joking about trading for a first round pick every year until the NFL folds but as you said that I began to think, since technically our SB "window" is open assuming Ben is coming back, why not stock up on guys who can help now and then when hes gone and the window is "closed" deal with the fact we are short a first rounder? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hey, maybe they will. I think we saw in September that the Steelers are indeed thinking along these lines with the Minkah Fitzpatrick trade. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Glad you liked my master plan, though.</p>
<p><strong>This Guy</strong>: Think we can find someone like Taysom Hill in the draft...or UFA? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: How about the actual Taysom Hill? He's a UFA himself. But I think there are rumblings out of NO that the Saints actually want to keep him and maybe even groom him for a world without Drew Brees. And yeah, I do wonder if more teams might see his success and try to find gadget-type players similar to him. I like the idea.</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: College OT format is ridiculous for the NFL. NFL format is fine. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Aaaand that's the game. We're out of time, as I'd like to go have some lunch. But as always, thanks for hanging out and chopping it up for a while. Somehow, doing these chats seems less stressful once the season is over. I wonder why. Have a nice week, all.</p>
