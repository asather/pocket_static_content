<h1>Tuned In: PBS introduces WWII drama; FX offers details on new ‘Fargo’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PASADENA, Calif. – PBS’s “Masterpiece” introduces the war drama “World on Fire” (9 p.m. April 5, WQED-TV), which plays like an old-school miniseries, telling the stories of multiple characters in multiple locations as World War II begins.</p>
<p>Helen Hunt (“Mad About You”) stars as an American journalist in Poland, Jonah Hauer-King (“Little Women”) plays an aspiring British diplomat and Brian J. Smith (“Sense8”) is a closeted gay American doctor in Paris.</p>
<p>The show has already been renewed for a second season and writer Peter Bowker said each season will cover one year in the war. He was inspired by the 1973-76 WWII documentary series “The World at War.”</p>
<p>“It had an enormous impact on me,” Mr. Bowker said. “I’d like to say in terms of its political content but I think probably more in terms of its storytelling and how it handles those multiple perspectives.”</p>

<p>When he began writing “World on Fire” in 2014, serialized dramas had started to become more popular thanks to DVD box sets and streaming.</p>
<p>“People were investing more in long-run series,” he said. “The way we watched television – the box set culture – had started to emerge and it seemed like a good time to tell something novelistic in its sweep.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Fargo’ No. 4</strong></p>
<p>The fourth season of “Fargo” (10 p.m. April 19, FX) is set in 1950 Kansas City as mobsters of various ethnic groups clash. Chris Rock stars as the head of an African-American clan in the&nbsp;anthology series inspired by the 1996 Coen Brothers film.</p>
<p>“People don't realize, but I grew up in Fargo,” Rock joked Thursday at an FX press conference. “No, I watched the previous three seasons. I thought it was, like, easily the best thing on television. So when I got the call, I thought he wanted me to, like, host something for his charity or something. I did not think in my wildest dreams he wanted me to be in the show, and I was shocked, pleasantly surprised.”</p>

<p>Series creator Noah Hawley said he created the role with Rock in mind. Mr. Hawley’s thematic inspiration for season four: The history of America is the history of the entrepreneur.</p>
<p>“It's the history of someone who starts with nothing and works their ass off to get someplace and then fights to hold onto what they have,” Mr. Hawley said. “I don't know the world of standup comedy, but you start with nothing, alone, and you have to fight your way up and then hold onto what you have. It felt to me like Chris embodied that spirit. Plus, he's funny.”</p>
<p>Rock said the comedy of “Fargo” is more like the humor found in a Martin Scorsese film, not a Jim Carrey movie.</p>
<p>“It's always within the character and within the story. As far as the themes of this season, yeah, I guess some of them I've probably touched in comedy routines before. I've obviously talked about race,” Rock said before leaning into comedy in his response. “Racism has been very good to me. It's worked out for me.”</p>
<p>While the location shifts south from the upper Midwest, there’s one significant character with a Minnesota accent, Oraetta Mayflower, played in a star-making turn by Irish actress Jessie Buckley.</p>
<p>As in past seasons of “Fargo” there’s a lawman, albeit a less predictable, upstanding police officer played by Jack Huston (“Boardwalk Empire”).</p>
<p>“In the movie and in the first three seasons, the all-good, moral character was always a cop,” Hawley said. “But the reality is there are a lot of Americans [where] that is not their experience of cops. And so my hope was to create a story this year in which that burden was lifted off the cop and allow [the character] to land in a different place on the moral spectrum. … We've done three of these, and it's really, I think, essential not to take anything for granted, and to question every decision we make, to make sure we're not repeating ourselves.”</p>
