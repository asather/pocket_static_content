<h1>Gene Therapy: USPS will collapse without urgent government intervention</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Late in a life ravaged by illness, John Prine, the great American&nbsp;lyricist who died April 7 from COVID-19, shouldered a workload of live&nbsp;performances. Part of his explanation for forcing himself through it&nbsp;was that, in an earlier life, he’d been a mailman, and mailmen go to&nbsp;work, no matter what.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln carried the mail. Walt Disney, first rejected by the&nbsp;Post Office for being too young, disguised himself as an older man to&nbsp;carry the mail and worked double shifts. My father carried the mail, too.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Inspectors once measured his daily route at 11 miles per day. He&nbsp;walked 11 miles when it was 90 degrees and walked 11 miles when it was&nbsp;9 below. (Oh, and here’s a big heavy bag to take with you!)</p>
<p>“Whoa!” I thought in my little boy’s brain. “So that’s what work looks like. I’ll be avoiding it at all costs.”</p>
<p>So look, wave to your mailman or mail person today. You might not have&nbsp;many more chances. As volume is down more than 30% with the&nbsp;coronavirus, the Postal Service won’t be solvent much longer, and an&nbsp;administration eager to bail out airlines and cruise lines is telling&nbsp;the Post Office to go sort itself.</p>
<p>This hasn’t been brought up once that I know of at the daily&nbsp;Trumpapalooza, but Virginia Congressman Gerry Connolly, chairman of&nbsp;the Subcommittee on Government Operations, has learned in&nbsp;conversations with Postmaster General Megan Brennan that the United&nbsp;States Postal Service will collapse without urgent government&nbsp;intervention.</p>
<p>And soon.</p>
<p>Maybe June.</p>
<p>Mr. Connolly says he’s pleaded with the White House, which kept&nbsp;emphasizing to Congress that President Donald Trump would not sign off on any stimulus&nbsp;package if it includes a bailout for the Post Office.</p>
<p>Already on&nbsp;record with his brilliant idea to defund the World Health Organization&nbsp;in the middle of a pandemic, the Buffoonatic-in-Chief’s next stroke of&nbsp;genius is to choke off one of the country’s primary lifelines.</p>
<p>Those COVID-19 relief checks scheduled to be mailed beginning this&nbsp;month and through September? Who’ll deliver them after June? Those 1.2&nbsp;billion deliveries of prescription drugs, many to rural seniors with&nbsp;no other means of getting them, who’ll be bringing them, Jared? All&nbsp;the correspondence needed to complete the census, what of that? All&nbsp;the pandemic’s critical personal protective equipment, is that Jared&nbsp;too? And all those ballots America needs to vote by mail this year . . .</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>No mail, then no ballots by mail, then, welp, no election. Is that&nbsp;where we’re going? Smells like another episode in the president’s&nbsp;raging pyromania of American institutions, the Post Office being just&nbsp;another provision in the Constitution that he finds an inconvenient&nbsp;encroachment on his authority.</p>
<p>Total authority.</p>
<p>Why would we even think that the Post Office, having propelled&nbsp;American commerce and correspondence for more than 200 years, would&nbsp;somehow fall beyond the scope of Mr. Trump’s we-don’t-need-that political&nbsp;dogma?</p>
<p>Environmental protections? We don’t need that. Consumer protections?&nbsp;We don’t need that. Worker safety regulations? We don’t need that.</p>
<p>National health care? We don’t need that. And most urgentla, the&nbsp;National Security Council’s Directorate for Global Health and&nbsp;Bio-Defense, established by the Obama Administration after the Ebola&nbsp;outbreak of 2014? Oh hell; we don’t need that. So here we are, headed&nbsp;into Week 6 of the Hunker Games.</p>
<p>Mail carriers have to be confused, don’t you think?</p>
<p>They’re out there every day, risking their health, because they’re&nbsp;“essential,” and few would argue otherwise, but the government looks&nbsp;perfectly eager to shut them down. How can they suddenly be judged so&nbsp;non-essential when they’re so essential?</p>
<p>The president’s savage proclivity to turn over essential government&nbsp;functions to private sector cronies and political lickspittles knows&nbsp;no limits. I guess he imagines the market will respond overnight to&nbsp;fill in for the Postal Service. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>One reliable estimate I saw this week said the Postal Service handled&nbsp;142 billion units of mail in 2019. United Parcel Service handled 5.5&nbsp;billion. That’s globally. FedEx handled less than 5 billion. I’m&nbsp;sure they’ll be able to ramp up to 142 billion overnight. And I’m sure&nbsp;the cost of your prescriptions and insurance won’t go up once all that&nbsp;volume gets transferred to other delivery services.</p>
<p>Choking the life from the Post Office, the country’s top provider of&nbsp;jobs for veterans, will put more than 600,000 more Americans out of&nbsp;work. Important work. The postal tests, 473 and 473E under civil&nbsp;service, take 90 minutes and include more than 200 questions. No such&nbsp;test is required for President of the United States maybe you’ve&nbsp;noticed.</p>
<p>So add this still-not-understood, still-spreading, still-uncontrolled,&nbsp;still-deadly virus to the ancient motto. “Neither snow nor rain nor&nbsp;heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion&nbsp;of their appointed rounds.”</p>
<p>No, it takes incorrigible stupidity to do that.</p>
