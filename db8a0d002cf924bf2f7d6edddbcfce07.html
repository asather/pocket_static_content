<h1>Pitt receives federal grant to study how autonomous vehicle industry serves people with disabilities</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh will spearhead a national study about the accessibility of autonomous transportation for people with disabilities after receiving a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>The grant and 18-month study were announced Thursday by Diana Furchtgott-Roth, the transportation department’s deputy assistant secretary for research and technology, during a virtual celebration for the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pitt will lead a coalition that includes the Uniformed University of Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., the Merlin Mobility Corporation in Atlanta and Toyota Mobility. The coalition will serve as the foundation for Pitt’s University Transportation Center for Accessible Autonomous Vehicles and Transportation.</p>
<p>“This grant will inform planners and policymakers of how broader transportation options will affect travel demand and quality of life for this cohort,” Ms. Furchtgott-Roth said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“From that information, wiser investments can be made by decision-makers who provide direct benefits to individual travelers with disabilities.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Rory Cooper, chair of the School of Health and Rehabilitation Services at Pitt, was named as the lead researcher on the study team and director of the center.&nbsp;Dr. Brad Dicianno will serve as the center’s co-director.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As we move forward with this, the city and county has been very open to autonomous vehicles. [Pittsburgh] doesn't have a simple grid layout with hills and weather; it’s great to see how autonomous vehicles handle these challenges,” Dr. Cooper said.</p>
<p>Dr. Cooper outlined three “projects” that the study will tackle: a systematic literature review; a national survey of people, car manufacturers and modifiers as well as a series of focus groups and mobility mapping; and a consumer market model where data is collected and displayed graphically.</p>
<p>The study will not develop autonomous vehicles in this phase, but will instead develop criteria that will allow manufacturers to meet standards for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>“Current transportation options for people with disabilities are limited,” Dr. Dicianno said. “Adapted vehicles, shuttle services, and public transportation are options but do not meet the needs of many people with disabilities because they are not always affordable, accessible, reliable, or available.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our goal is not only to understand the needs of people with disabilities with respect to automated transportation, but also to develop design strategies to meet them,” he said.</p>
<p>While government agencies and vehicle manufacturers alike have invested in autonomous vehicle technology, Dr. Dicianno said there are no clear guidelines for meeting the accessibility needs of those with disabilities.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 61 million Americans — about 25% of the nation — live with some form of a disability.</p>
<p>“Accessible autonomous transportation could facilitate opportunities for people with disabilities to find or maintain employment, obtain better access to healthcare, and integrate more fully into the community,” Dr. Dicianno said.</p>
<p>“The American spirit is to problem-solve at the scale a large and diverse country demands,” Ms. Furchtgott-Roth said.&nbsp;“How do we help address needs for the many and not the few?”</p>
