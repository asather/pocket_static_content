<h1>Obituary: Ex-Steeler Dave Smith was first IUP player drafted into the NFL</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>He was a punchline for Johnny Carson and will forever be on the NFL Films blooper reel. Before Leon Lett showboated on his way to the end zone in Super Bowl XXVII, there was Steelers receiver Dave Smith, whose infamous blunder on “Monday Night Football” in 1970 remains among the game’s biggest blunders.</p>
<p>After Mr. Smith reeled in a pass from Terry Bradshaw and was approaching the end zone, he put up his hands to celebrate. Just before he crossed the goal line, the ball popped out of his left hand and rolled out of the back of the end zone for a turnover. The Steelers lost the game, 31-14.</p>
<p>“I had beaten Emmitt Thomas on the play,” Mr. Smith recalled during an interview with Steelcity Insider in 2018. “He actually is the one who later convinced Kansas City to sign me after Pittsburgh. Anyway, after the play I had to walk by the Kansas City bench, then Pittsburgh players. They were all on the same side then. I walked by Chuck [Noll] and he gave me a wry smile. ‘Do you think you can get us another one?’ he asked me. I said I would get him another before the night was out.”</p>
<p>Mr. Smith, a member of the IUP Athletic Hall of Fame, died earlier this week, according to the school. He was 73. No details of his death were immediately available, and arrangements were not immediately known.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith was the first player from IUP to be drafted by an NFL team. The Steelers selected him in the eighth round of the 1970 draft, which also included Pro Football Hall of Famers Bradshaw and Mel Blount.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith started seven games as a rookie and all 14 games in his second season with the Steelers, leading the team with five touchdown receptions. Other players such as Jim Haslett would follow in his footsteps, but Mr. Smith is credited with starting the IUP pipeline to the NFL.</p>
<p>“He was the first player to put IUP on the map,” said Jack Benedict, the longtime play-by-play man for IUP football and basketball. “It was like, ‘Wow, we had a guy drafted by the Steelers.’ He set the tone. He was one of the greatest athletes ever at IUP.”</p>
<p>Mr. Smith grew up in Brooklyn and played against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in high school. He first attended Waynesburg University, where he played defensive back before transferring to IUP.</p>
<p>Chuck Klausing was the head coach at IUP during Mr. Smith’s career and maintained a close relationship with him until Klausing’s passing. Together they led IUP to the Boardwalk Bowl in 1968, where they fell to highly favored Delaware, 31-24.</p>
<p>The game was played on a Saturday afternoon in Atlantic City. Later that night, he played in an IUP basketball game against Geneva.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith was on campus for the 50th reunion of the Boardwalk Bowl team two years ago. He also visited campus over the winter for a basketball game.</p>
<p>“There are some people who say Dave was a better basketball player than a football player,” said Tom Klausing, Chuck’s son who kept in touch with Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>There also are some who believe Mr. Smith was talented enough to be a part of the Steelers’ Super Bowl teams of the 1970s, but clashes with Noll led to a midseason trade in 1972. On one occasion, Noll removed Mr. Smith from a game, and instead of walking directly to the sidelines, Mr. Smith walked through the end zone and took the long route to the sidelines so as to avoid Noll.</p>
<p>The Steelers traded Mr. Smith to the Houston Oilers after the sixth game of the 1972 season. He finished his career with the Kansas City Chiefs in 1973. He played in 44 NFL games with 35 starts and finished his career with 109 receptions and seven touchdowns, plus the one that got away in Kansas City that fateful Monday night.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith went to work in a number of fields after his professional football career ended. He had a short stint as a producer and radio and television host at KDKA from 1974-76. He also worked for American Cyanamid and DuPont before becoming a managing partner for Pro Am International, a marketing firm that specialized in sports and entertainment.</p>
