<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday issued new restrictions to help curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, ordering all barber shops, hair and nail salons, spas, and tattoo shops closed, and shutting down 181 branches of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p>The BMV shutdown will leave just five unspecified branches open to handle commercial drivers’ licenses to maintain necessary transportation systems. The order also means the state’s 52 driver-exam stations are closed.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine instructed the Ohio State Highway Patrol not to issue citations to drivers who cannot renew expired licenses because of the closures, and asked that other law enforcement agencies in the state follow suit. He said he will ask the General Assembly to grant a grace period for license renewals.</p>
<p>Without signing an order mandating it, Mr. DeWine said he is “deadly serious” about having businesses take steps to protect their employees, whether it means allowing them to work from home, keeping them from working close together while at the work place, or ensuring that someone who shows possible symptoms is allowed to stay home.</p>
<p>“We are asking them to begin immediately to take the temperature of every single employee every single day before they come to work,” he said. “We’re asking them to be very aggressive in regard to cleaning surfaces, in regard to having the ability of soap, water, … hand sanitizers. These are things that businesses can do and do immediately.”</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, the Ohio Department of Health reported 88 confirmed coronavirus cases across 19 counties — including one confirmed case in Lucas County. Local health officials said late Tuesday that a second possible case of coronavirus in the county is under investigation. During their own briefing Wednesday afternoon, health officials said they still have not received results from that test.</p>
<p>Statewide, the people who have tested positive range in age from 2 to 91, with a median age of 48.5. Of the confirmed cases in the state, 26 people are hospitalized, the state said, and 333 individuals are under health supervision.</p>
<p>The governor, accompanied by other state officials, has been providing daily updates on the situation in Ohio. He has regularly increased restrictions to promote social distancing to slow down the inevitable spread of the virus and reduce demand on health care systems.</p>
<p>“The virus is here,” Mr. DeWine said. “It lives among us, and we must be at war with it. We are at war with a very dangerous and lethal enemy. The virus’s mission is to reproduce and, for it to go from person to person, it needs our help. ... We become the enablers. ... We have it within our own control how fast it spreads and how widespread it spreads.”</p>
<p>At a local news conference where officials and media members were required to have their temperature taken before entering the Lucas County Emergency Services Center on Jefferson Avenue, Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz thanked the community for rallying together during the global pandemic.</p>
<p>“While these are difficult times, and will continue to be difficult times for our community and for our country ... it is also a time that has the ability to bring out the best in our human nature,” he said. “The charitable kindness that resides in all of us.”</p>
<p>He added: “We are seeing that in our community. ... We have seen countless organizations step to the fore.”</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine and health director Amy Acton on Wednesday urged Ohioans to not “fixate” on testing, admitting that the state has a “limited” number of test kits available and the situation likely won’t be changing anytime soon. They again said that most people will be able to weather the illness at home and may never know whether they ever actually had the coronavirus. The governor advised the public to act like they have the virus if they are feeling symptoms.</p>
<p>Toledo-Lucas County Health Commissioner Eric Zgodzinski echoed the governor’s sentiments, telling the public, “case numbers are important but only to a certain extent,” adding, “We all must realize that the virus is here.”</p>
<p>“If you have symptoms whether you have a test or not, act as though you have the virus,” he said at the daily briefing. “Stay home, practice social distancing. Wash your hands. Keep surfaces clean.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the state ordered all nonessential and elective surgeries postponed to conserve medical supplies and hospital bed space.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine had previously ordered all K-12 schools closed for three weeks while warning that the closures will likely last longer than that. The governor said it is possible that students may not return to their school buildings this school year.</p>
<p>He shut down dine-in service at restaurants as well as bars, movie theaters, fitness centers, casinos, and bowling alleys. All gatherings of 50 or more people are banned. He has warned that daycare centers could follow.</p>
<p>The state’s primary election, which was to happen Tuesday, was postponed The governor has talked about holding Election Day on June 2, but that decision is likely to be made by the General Assembly next week.</p>
<p>The state has sought to make workers, who are furloughed as a result of the coronavirus-related business closings, eligible more quickly for unemployment compensation, a system already considered underfunded before the additional demands were placed on it.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago the system received 6,500 applications for benefits. This week it received 78,000, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said.</p>
