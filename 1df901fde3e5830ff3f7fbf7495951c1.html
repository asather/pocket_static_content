<h1>TV Q&amp;A: What does a move to weekends mean for local news anchors?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Post-Gazette TV writer Rob Owen answers reader questions online every Friday in Tuned In Journal blog at post-gazette.com/tv. Here’s a selection of recent queries.</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: When local news anchors and meteorologists are demoted to working on the weekends, generally speaking, what are the reasons for the demotions? Eg: bad weather forecasts, bad reporting, negative viewer feedback on anchor/meteorologist, etc?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— JARED VIA EMAIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> It rarely has anything to do with the job performance of the person being moved to weekends. Usually it is about ratings, which station executives may tie into research they conduct on on-air talent to find who viewers like and dislike (so that would take into account negative viewer feedback). Sometimes it’s just a question of chemistry with other members of the on-air studio team. Personal performance may sometimes be a factor, but often it is not.</p>
<p><strong>Q: There are always segments of NBC's “Today” show involving cooking or baking. How come those involved are not required to wear plastic gloves as are required in most eating establishments?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—&nbsp;GEORGE, MCCANDLESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> The “Today” show studio is not an eating establishment. It’s a TV studio.</p>
<p>Just as anyone cooking at home is not required to wear plastic gloves, why would the “Today” anchors be required to do that? If the food baked/cooked in the studio was being served to people beyond the show’s hosts, that might be another thing&nbsp;— but it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I notice that sometimes on CNBC the ads run with the financial crawl info running under them and other times it is purely an ad without the crawl. I am wondering, does it cost more to advertise without the crawl or what determines the difference as to whether or not the crawl is there?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—&nbsp;JOYCE, SCOTT TOWNSHIP</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Yes and no.</p>
<p>My understanding is the ticker doesn’t run during a local commercial break. The ticker is there during a national commercial break.</p>
<p>National and local ads are priced differently but that pricing is not a factor for when the ticker is and is not on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So Gayle King stayed with “CBS This Morning,” Nora O’Donnell went to the evening news. What happened to John Dickerson?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—&nbsp;KELLY VIA EMAIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Dickerson, who has always been a favorite of mine (I’ve been listening to him on the Slate Political Gabfest podcast for at least a decade), shifted to CBS’s “60 Minutes.” “60” seems like a better fit for Dickerson, although I still think they never should have taken him off “Face the Nation,” which is probably the CBS news program he is most suited to host.</p>
<p><strong>Q: It only caught my attention recently that “The Big Bang Theory’s” two main characters are named after the producer of some pretty terrific 1960s, 1970s TV shows: Sheldon Leonard. Any thoughts/insight on that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—&nbsp;KATHRYN, VIA FACEBOOK</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> The characters' first names were indeed a tribute to the '60s TV producer. Other hidden-in-plain-sight gems include the characters’ last names. Leonard Hofstadter is named after 1961 Nobel Prize in physics winner Robert Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper is named after Nobel Prize Laureate Leon Cooper.</p>
