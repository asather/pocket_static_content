<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 05.28.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Let’s get started</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: I do not share in the widespread optimism of Big Ben being the missing piece to a Steeler Super Bowl run. He got 3 points in the opener against the Pats last season. Seriously. 3 points. He also has a long history of playing small in big games .... falling behind by 20 or more points before getting a few garbage time touchdowns against soft prevent defenses to make games look closer than they really were. With the $68 million 2-year cap destroying extension he signed in April 2019 are the Steelers just buried until 2022? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think Ben will help the offense out. I don’t know how much though and I do agree that people are giving way too much credit to his return. I don’t think his impact will be that great and I also think the defense will take a step back this year and they still won’t be able to run the ball effectively</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: If Ben and most of the defensive stars stay healthy, and the Steelers miss the playoffs again, is Tomlin finally on the hot seat? Mr.Rooney gave him a shorter extension than normal last year for a reason. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No I don’t think so. Now he may be smart and understand it could be a while before the Steelers are great again and leave on his own but he won’t be pushed out</p>
<p><strong>Amanda</strong>: I will never forget how you and Walls were laughing at me because I called you 2 out on talking about alcohol on the air. You and him should be ashamed of yourselves. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Have another beer, relax</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: If there is a MLB seson this year--and I am hoping there isn't so I can avoid the Bucs being throttled daily--on what two or three things about the PBC wouldyou concentrate?? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well pitching is always key in baseball and pitching with this team especially. I have no idea what they will get out of their starters at all. They could be really good ahd <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: or really bad. I also think the heart of the order of Reynolds-Bella <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: -Polanco has to produce. And infield defense, which still won’t be stellar needs to improve</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Do you think D Johnson will be the next superstar and do you think the Steelers are flying under the Radar? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: He has a chance to Be a very good player. I don’t know about superstar but I could see him being a productive receiver for a long time. I think most people have the Steelers in the 8 to 10 win range so no I don’t think they are under the radar that is about where they should be</p>
<p><strong>Caddisman</strong>: Hi, Paul. I'm not a hockey fan, but I'm curious about the proposed playoffs. With a 3-4 week mini training camp, and the complete playoffs, wouldn't this lead directly into the training camp for next season? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes I think training camp will be shortened as will the preseason and next season will start maybe two weeks later than normal. But they want to push the start of that back as far as possible so they can be sure to have fans in the stands for the entire season</p>
<p><strong>DormontDirtbag</strong>: One has to believe defense will be ahead of offense when NHL tourney starts. You then notice that the first round will be a Murray versus Price goalie matchup. If you were inclined to put cash down at Rivers Casino, might you put it on the Habs? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No. Not at all. I might put it on the under every game but I think the Pens will sweep the Canadians. Montreal is a bad, bad team with a really good goalie</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: Should I buy tickets and make travel/hotel/etc. plans for the Steelers Thanksgiving Day game against the Ravens? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes. I believe the NFL will have stadiums full by mid season</p>
<p><strong>ATM</strong>: hi paul, you are the man in pittsburgh sports chats. thank you. it seems, at least to me, that. mason rudolph has taken so much unnecessary criticism over his qb skills at the pro level. is it not the oc's job as qb coach to broaden his skill level, ie. to move around in the pocket and when and how to move out of it. he was like a soldier at attention in there even with the heat on. where was randy fitchner? where was management to hold randy to the teaching task. mr is a fine qb with competent and attentive coaching. and, i understand that the former pitt oc is qb coach now. but, we still have randy with teaching the offense. doesn't management have some responsibilty to oversee player development in spite of questionable coaching at certain areas? thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yeah the one thing that I would say is Rudolph was thrown into a tough situation and probably a bit before they thought that he would need to be ready. I am not a big believer in Randy Fichtner but here is a friend of the coach and of the quarterback so we are stuck with him</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville</strong>: Hi Paul. If you had to bet your mortgage on it, which three QB’s would make the Steelers final roster. Mine are Ben, Mason and Paxton Lynch. I find it hard to believe Barrett would make it and really, they didn’t even want Duck last year. Thanks for your time. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well if you listen to a certain talk show host in town it will be Ben, Jameis Winston, Cam Newton, Josh Rosen, Joe Flacco and Mason Rudolph........ Me, I agree with you it will probably be Ben, Rudolph and Lynch</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Is the NHL really going to play playoff hockey in August or is that a pipe dream? Would the Pens have an * after their names if they win the Cup? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No it isn’t a pipe dream it is a realty. And if the Pens were to beat the Canadians, Flyers, Bruins, Lightning and say the Blues in playoff series, there is nothing asterisk-worthy about that</p>
<p><strong>Mrs Dorothy</strong>: Name each team you root for from the 4 U.S Major Sports Paul.. common we know yo have them ! Don’t be silly.. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I root for the Houston Oilers. And seeing as they died in 1996 and broke my heart I have no NFL team. I obviously hope the Steelers do well because they are the local team but I don’t really get moved one way or the other if they win or lose. I am a huge 76ers fan and they have always been my team going back to Dr. J, one of my favorite athletes of all time. I don’t really have hockey team though growing up I was a huge fan of the Calgary Flames. I root for the Penguins and Capitals to play each other in the playoffs though because those will be 7 incredible games to watch. And while I Hope the Pens do well because they are local I was happy for The Capitals and Ovechkin that they finally won it all. In baseball I was always a huge A’s fan growing up. I root more for players than teams though. So I don’t have many pro teams I root for it is probably easier to figure out who I root against - I root hard against whoever Joe Maddon is managing, the Patriots and Cowboys, the Warriors and whoever Kevin Durant play <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: S for and the Rangers/Islanders/Devils/Flyers/Bruins cooridor....</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Hey Paul fellow Steeler hater here since I liked your article about all that has to go right for Steelers to finish above .500. Other thing one isn't allowed to discuss is Bens contract and why it would be so preposterous to suggest he take hometown discount. If its so about winning now then why wouldn't he? instead of making sure his grandkids kids are taken care of. Another 5-6M solves depth issues at ILB, instead we get to try 3 people who haven't proven themselves. Thanks as always for the chats <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I agree. The Steelers screwed up. I would have said “we have paid you $200 million+ for your career. You are now 37 and aging. You get two years $50 million total or you will need to finish your career elsewhere. That would free up $10 million a year to use elsewhere and he would have taken it</p>
<p><strong>Adam</strong>: Do you think pirates could make the playoffs if less games? They do start out pretty strong before the all star break so. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes I do because I think anything can happen in a shorter series. I think that’s realistic as well. If they were to get off to a hot start there is a lot less time in terms of games remaining for them to fall back to the pack when their lack of depth and pitching finally gets exposed</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: Long time Pitt BB season ticket holder who’s not buying all of Pitt’s excuses for not playing Duquesne this season. When they do play, I always hope for a close game so all the fans into the game. I can’t believe <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The fact that they have Drexel and not Duquesne on their schedule is absolutely silly. Pitt should be ashamed of itself</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: You and this guy John strange should take a glass of BR7 cool aid , I have a full refrigerator full, how many QB have 2 SB, and Bradshaw 4 get very little credit! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Let’s try this again only this time in English.</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: believe they are saving that much by not playing Duquesne. I know Capel is trying hard but is any closer to landing a big man for upcoming season? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes I think he has a big man coming in both 2020 and the 2021 classes</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Watching the match this past weekend, loved players having there own carts. It seemed to speed up play. Should be a consideration when golf starts back up. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I agree a million percent. They absolutely should do that for every event but the purists will argue it will cut caddies out of wages and that walking is a part of the game</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: Saw a list on ESPN.com that listed top college football teams that failed to win National Championship by Bill Connelly. He listed top 25 teams and no mention of Pitt 1981 team. I admit I’m bias but that teams has to be at least in top 25 of teams not ro win a National Championship. Where would you rank that team? (Yes we are Scrapping bottom of barrel for sports stories mentioning this.) <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: That team - or one of the three 11-1 teams in a row - should be in the top 10</p>
<p><strong>Church Lady</strong>: Did Amanda hangout with Carrie Nation in High School? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Now that is funny. I wonder if Amanda is a fan of the rock group Boston... <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: “I’m gonna take you by surprise and make you realize, Amanda.....”</p>
<p><strong>Coyote</strong>: When will Narduzzi be on the hot seat? Average pretty much sums up his teams for the past 3 seasons. Out offensive recruiting has been subpar too. If the season happens and they have another 7-6, 8-5 season or worse will Heather finally look to dump this guy? I don't think he is a good coach at all. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would think if he doesn’t produce a big season this year there will be some pressure on him to produce a big season. He has done a good job of rebuilding but now he needs to produce on the field. I think they have a chance to be really good but they better not lose games to bad teams this year</p>
<p><strong>Amanda</strong>: I convinced my husband to stop praising you. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I know, he told me that you tried and that why he is filing for a divorce. He loves me and my show more than he loves you and the more I interact with you the more easy it becomes to understand why!! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: That’s it for me have a great weekend!!!</p>
