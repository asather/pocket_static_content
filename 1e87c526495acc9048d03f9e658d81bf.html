<h1>Peduto administration introduces CROWN Act bill to protect natural hairstyles</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto has submitted legislation that could protect individuals, particularly Black individuals, from discrimination based on hairstyles.</p>
<p>The bill, called the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act, or the CROWN Act, follows a national trend of cities and states passing legislation to prevent discrimination based on hairstyle in the workplace and other public accommodations.</p>
<p>Often, Black individuals are forced to adhere to hairstyle and professional appearance standards that&nbsp;“tend to reflect European or white standards,” the administration said in a Monday announcement.</p>
<p>“The city of Pittsburgh is committed to equity and to eliminating the barriers that unfairly affect our communities,” Mr. Peduto said in a press release. “Black hair is and always has been professional, but that has not always been reflected by employers, schools, or agencies in this city. This legislation affirms our commitment to improving outcomes for Black residents and make certain that they do not face natural hair discrimination in the workplace, when searching for a home, or when entering a business.”</p>
<p>CROWN Act legislation has been introduced at the state level.&nbsp;Philadelphia’s City Council is also considering the ordinance.</p>
<p>Other jurisdictions that have passed similar laws include California, Colorado, New York and New Jersey as well as Montgomery County, Md., Cinncinati and Kansas City, Mo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Pittsburgh adopts the law, individuals who have faced discrimination based on hairstyle would have legal redress through the city’s Human Relations Commission</p>
<p>The commission has received “numerous” complaints based on hairstyle discrimination, but complainants were forced to file them under race or religious discrimination, according to the body.</p>
<p>Megan Stanley, the commission’s executive director, did not share a specific number of complaints but said that the commission is currently investigating a case that&nbsp;“in part related to natural hairstyle and the treatment of that hairstyle and alleged harassment from co-workers.”</p>
<p>“You can't measure a problem that didn't have protection based on how many calls happened when the protection didn't exist,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, [this general issue] is both natural hair discrimination and probably race discrimination.&nbsp;These issues have been so systemic that some of it has really unfortunately become part of what people face every day,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

The legislation to protect individuals based on hairstyle remains in county council’s Government Reform Committee after twice it failed to receive enough votes to move to the full body.</p>
