<p>WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the first game of Major League Baseball’s pandemic-delayed regular season.</p>
<p>The Washington Nationals announced Monday that Fauci -- a self-described fan of the reigning World Series champions -- accepted the team’s invitation to have the pregame honor Thursday night.</p>
<p>"Dr. Fauci has been a true champion for our country during the COVID-19 pandemic and throughout his distinguished career, so it is only fitting that we honor him as we kick off the 2020 season and defend our World Series Championship title," the Nationals announced in its statement.</p>
<p>The Nationals host the New York Yankees to open the season nearly four months after it originally was scheduled to begin. Spring training was halted in March because of the COVID-19 outbreak and teams resumed preparing to play this month.</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci was often seen sporting a Nats-themed mask while testifying before Congress last month.</p>
<p>During an interview with The New York Times in April, Fauci said he has played baseball since he was a kid. The native Brooklynite said he grew up supporting the New York Yankees, but since his move to the D.C.-area, "I don’t think there’s any place that I relax more than sitting in Nats Park and watching my now world champion Nats play a game."</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci has been one of the most recognizable faces of the White House's coronavirus response efforts during the pandemic and has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since the Reagan administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has expressed caution at returning to sporting venues, where large crowds of screaming fans could pose a major risk for coronavirus spread. He advised the season to end by the fall, concerned that cooler weather could make conditions more dangerous for players.</p>
