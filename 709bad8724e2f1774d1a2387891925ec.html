<h1>'Hamilton' to hit movie theaters in 2021</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Hamilton” will soon be available for all to see, for all time.</p>
<p>The movie version of the smash-hit musical is coming to the big screen on Oct. 15, 2021, courtesy of The Walt Disney Co.</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise that creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, with director Thomas Kail and producer Jeffrey Seller, would partner with Disney on bringing the original Broadway cast to the big screen.&nbsp;Miranda has a deal with Disney that has included his work on the animated film "Moana" and appeared in Rob Marshall's "Mary Poppins Returns” in 2018.</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers hip-hop musical that won 11 Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize for Miranda, will be released by The Walt Disney Studios in the United States and Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And just because it is due in movie theaters doesn’t mean that “Hamilton” will leave the stage. The touring musical, which made its Pittsburgh debut in January 2019, is returning to the Benedum Center for the 2020-21 Broadway Series season.</p>
<p>According to the press release sent Monday, "The film of the original Broadway cast performing 'Hamilton' is a leap forward in the art of 'live capture.' This movie transports its audience into the world of the Broadway show in a uniquely intimate way. Combining the best elements of live theater and film, the result is a cinematic stage performance that is a wholly new way to experience 'Hamilton.'"</p>
<p>The cast includes Miranda as Alexander Hamilton; Daveed Diggs as Marquis de Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson, Christopher Jackson as George Washington, Jonathan Groff as King George, Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton, and two Tony-winning Carnegie Mellon alums, Renée Elise Goldsberry as Angelica Schuyler and Leslie Odom Jr.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled for fans of the show, and new audiences across the world, to experience what it was like on stage —&nbsp;and in the audience —&nbsp;when we shot this at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway in June of 2016," said director Kail, whose mother, Wendy Green Kail, is from Squirrel Hill.</p>
<p>"We wanted to give everyone the same seat, which is what this film can provide."</p>
