<h1>Southern Beltway construction resumes under COVID-19 restrictions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After almost a month off due to the COVID-19 virus emergency, construction resumed last week on the last sections of the 13-mile, $900 million Southern Beltway on the Allegheny-Washington county border.</p>
<p>But the construction sites that crews came back to weren’t nearly the same as when they left March 16 after Gov. Tom Wolf ordered them closed to slow the spread of the deadly virus. With concerns about the virus continuing, contractors have to follow a new, 31-page package of safety procedures that include employees taking their temperatures when they leave from home and arrive at work, additional hand-washing stations and sanitizing wipes at the site and maintaining a safe distance from co-workers during duties ranging from excavating dirt to placing bridge girders to installing drainage.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The differences were apparent from the beginning: The first job last week, even before construction workers could return, saw crews sanitizing machinery and equipment abruptly left at the most active sites along Interstate 79.That didn’t start until officials from the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which is building the new highway between I-79 and Route 22, held a series of video conferences with contractors to make sure everyone was aware of the new safety procedures before authorizing work to continue.</p>
<p>Even reporting to the job site is different. Only one worker can ride in a vehicle at a time, so workers either will drive their personal vehicles farther into a job site or walk a long distance after getting out of their vehicle.</p>
<p>The remaining work on this five-year project is the most complicated: building an interchange with I-79. This involves digging a valley under the interstate to create a path for the new highway and building new bridges on the interstate across the valley.</p>
<p>“The main challenge will be for workers to perform their tasks while maintaining a minimum six feet from other workers,” said Steve Hrvoich, the turnpike’s construction engineering manager for the beltway project. “Certain operations that require workers to get closer may experience decreased productivity.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hrvoich said the most challenging operation under the new working conditions is placing steel beams for the new bridges. Under ordinary circumstances, that involves a crane operator or two moving the beams into place, then a team of ironworkers and laborers scrambling onto the beam to make sure it is seated properly and attach dozens of bolts to hold it in place.</p>
<p>Crews were meeting Thursday with turnpike officials to see whether this can be done under the six-foot rule and what alternatives might allow workers to get closer during that critical function.</p>
<p>Right now, all traffic is on the northbound lanes of I-79 while&nbsp;Walsh Construction II and its subcontractors erect the new bridges on the southbound side. Before the delay, plans called for switching all traffic to the southbound lanes by late July, but that probably will be moved back by at least a month.</p>
<p>“The first thing we have to contend with is the period of time the project has lost,” Mr. Hrvoich said.&nbsp;“It’s still too early to tell whether we’ll be able to stay near that schedule.”</p>
<p>Brad Heigel, the turnpike’s chief engineer, said dealing with new work constraints is&nbsp;“another bump in the road” for the beltway project, the first completely new highway built in Western Pennsylvania in several decades. Extremely heavy rainfall in 2017 and 2018 led to repeated flooding problems along Route 980 outside McDonald, where detention ponds and other runoff controls were overwhelmed during excavation and bridge construction.</p>
<p>“Steve and his crew are truly challenged,” Mr. Heigel said.&nbsp;“As engineers … we’ve all faced challenges that come up during a project, but at the end of the day, we all know the end game and we can figure out how to get there.”</p>
<p>Mr. Heigel said the beltway is among four projects allowed to resume out of 47 the turnpike had scheduled this year. They all were chosen for safety reasons, either the dangers created by the work such as no shoulders to use in emergencies along I-79 during the beltway project or the situations they are correcting, such as replacing the lighting system inside the Allegheny Tunnel in Somerset County.</p>
<p>The other two projects are refurbishing the&nbsp;Tuscarora Tunnel at the Huntingdon-Franklin county line and rebuilding a seven-mile stretch of the Northeast Extension in the eastern part of the state.</p>
<p>“Safety was a big component of why we started these particular projects,” Mr. Heigel said.&nbsp;“We just can’t let these projects sit in limbo forever.”</p>
<p>Mr. Heigel said he is hopeful&nbsp;“a few more” projects will resume this construction season, but that depends on the experience the agency has with the first four.</p>
<p>“Part of it is going to be lessons learned,” he said.&nbsp;“It’s not going to be easy. Each project has its own nuances.”</p>
