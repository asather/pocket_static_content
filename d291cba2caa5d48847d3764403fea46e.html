<h1>Longtime landscaper creates a great garden deer won’t devour</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bob Donnan has a Penn State degree in ornamental landscaping and 35 years’ experience tending yards in the South Hills. So why does he have invasives like Japanese barberry and burning bush in his yard?</p>
<p>Because deer don’t eat them, he says, and because they are beautiful if pruned and managed. He nods at ‘Bonanza Gold’ and two ‘Rose Glow’ barberries.</p>
<p>“Where do you see gold like that?” he says, pointing to Bonanza’s shiny yellow mound of thorny foliage.</p>
<p>Then he notes how the tiny leaves of the ‘Ruby Glow’ that gets sun are much more vibrant than the one in shade. This is a gardener who plans everything.</p>
<p>The result is a ¼-acre lot jammed with 27 varieties of trees, 25 types of shrubs and 12 kinds of perennials. There are also two dozen pots of annual flowers on the back deck, but his wife chooses those.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven years ago, when he and Susan moved into this house in Peters, a neighbor was surprised to see four large balled and burlapped trees in the tiny front yard.</p>
<p>“Where you gonna put all those?” she wondered.</p>
<p>Today, 14 trees and 34 shrubs are artfully jammed into that space, creating an outdoor room with contrasting foliage color, texture and interesting specimens. Mr. Donnan especially likes weepers and has draping versions of hemlock, purple beech, Norway spruce, hornbeam and larch in front.</p>
<p>In the morning before a reporter and photographer visited, he quickly compiled a list of cultivars that would make any gardener green with envy: ‘Rohanii’ European beech, ‘Snowflake’ Canadian hemlock, Persian lilac, ‘Ruby Slippers’ oakleaf hydrangea, ‘Nova Zembla’ rhododendron and ‘Bird Nest’ spruce.</p>
<p>Sprinkled among them are shrubs that deer usually skip, including hinoki cypress, Northern bayberry, ‘Golden Elf’ and ‘Little Princess’ spirea and ‘Mountain Fire’ pieris. Only the daylilies out front fell victim to hungry Washington County whitetails, and they seem to be recovering.</p>
<p>Some of his favorite deer-resistant plants are in back: doublefile viburnum and ‘Winter Gem’ boxwood, which doesn’t brown in winter like many other boxwoods. Mr. Donnan posts Bobscaping videos on how to properly prune boxwood on YouTube.</p>

<p>Mr. Donnan, who grew up in Washington, Pa., traces his love of gardening and especially trees to his grandfather, who owned property in West Middletown, Washington County. He began working part-time at Chaffon’s Nursery near Donaldson’s Crossroads, where he learned “both ends of the shovel,” he said. He learned even more horticulture from Gretchen Schmidt at Crossroads Garden Center.</p>
<p>“She was like a walking textbook,” he said. “I wanted to be like her.”</p>
<p>He began growing his own trees and landscaping in Peters, Upper St. Clair and Bethel Park.</p>
<p>As the local deer population has grown, Mr. Donnan has tried to steer his customers away from their favorite browse. Unfortunately, those deer treats are also some of his clients’ favorites: rhododendron, azalea, hydrangea, roses and other flowering shrubs.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t plant anything deer would eat. That narrows your options,” he said. “And if you’ve got shade, you have fewer options.”</p>
<p>He often warned people away from hostas; ones with thinner leaves are often decimated by deer and rabbits. And sometimes new homeowners would tell his landscapers to remove hostas planted by former homeowners. Mr. Donnan tossed three types of hosta into his truck “like a cook taking leftovers home” and found a place for them by his backyard shed. When deer stop by, they usually pass up the thick-leafed blue and a variegated hosta and go right for the tender green one in the middle, he said.</p>
<p>On a hillside in the backyard is a tall, healthy hemlock tree that he removed from a yard 30 years ago because it wasn’t doing well. It looks happy in this quick-draining soil.</p>
<p>“Hemlocks are very fussy,” he said. “They can’t stand wet feet.”</p>
<p>Hemlocks, dogwoods and rhododendrons are plants Mr. Donnan often has to replace, so he advises against them. He has a Bobscaping video on YouTube on protecting young trees from deer rubbing.&nbsp;Doublefile viburnum, which is rarely eaten by deer, rivals dogwood trees with its white blossoms in spring, he noted.</p>

<p>Though Mrs. Donnan is the flower gardener who tends the pots on the deck, her husband is a big help. He knows nearly every cultivar — he keeps the tags in the pots —&nbsp;and they’re some of the healthiest begonias, sunpatiens and geraniums you’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>He will move a pot or a plant if it’s not happy, but he has his limits.</p>
<p>“If something isn’t doing well, I’m not afraid to pull it out,” the longtime landscaper said.</p>
<p>In this garden, only the strong survive —&nbsp;and thrive.</p>
