<p>The Oscars will roll out the red carpet on April 25, 2021.</p>
<p>That’s the date when the 93rd Academy Awards are expected to be broadcast live from the Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood &amp; Highland Center.</p>
<p>“For over a century, movies have played an important role in comforting, inspiring and entertaining us during the darkest of times. They certainly have this year. Our hope, in extending the eligibility period and our awards date, is to provide the flexibility filmmakers need to finish and release their films without being penalized for something beyond anyone’s control,” read a joint statement from Academy President David Rubin and Academy CEO Dawn Hudson.</p>
<p>The Awards were originally scheduled for Feb. 28, 2021. The pandemic shut down productions across the world and only last week were some restrictions lifted for shooting in California.</p>
<p>Eligibility rules, which used to mandate a film’s release by Dec. 31, have created a special window from Jan. 1, 2020 to Feb. 28, 2021. The Academy presentation of awards for Scientific and Technical achievement were to be announced June 20 of this year in Beverly Hills. They have not yet been rescheduled.</p>
<p>In addition, the public opening of the Academy’s Museum of Motion Pictures has been moved from Dec. 14 to April 30, 2021.</p>
