<h1>These Steelers Pro Bowlers are about to get paid soon</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ORLANDO, Fla. — The Steelers don’t have any pending unrestricted free agents playing in the Pro Bowl this week, but a couple of players from their highly ranked defense could get new contracts in the coming months.</p>
<p>Veteran defensive end Cam Heyward is entering the final year of his six-year, $59 million contract that carries a $13.2 million cap hit in 2020. The Steelers can create some much-needed room under their cap by signing Heyward to a new contract and reducing his cap hit in 2020. That would, in turn, help free up the funds necessary <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/21/bud-dupree-contract-franchise-tag-steelers-art-rooney-ii/stories/202001210085" target="_blank">to place the franchise tag on Bud Dupree</a> among other potential signings when the new league year begins March 18.</p>
<p>The Steelers have tried to sign select players earlier in the calendar year in recent years. Two years ago, they began contract negotiations with Le’Veon Bell at the Pro Bowl in hopes of signing him to a long-term contract instead of using the franchise tag on him for a second consecutive year. The Steelers could not come to terms with Bell and placed the tag on him again. He did not sign it and sat out the entire 2018 season.</p>
<p>Last year, the Steelers signed center Maurkice Pouncey to a three-year contract when he, like Heyward this year, was entering the final year of his deal.</p>
<p>There is much more to signing Heyward to a new contract than salary cap benefits. He’s playing the best football of his nine-year career. Heyward is playing in his third consecutive Pro Bowl and earned first-team All-Pro honors for the second time in three years.</p>
<p>The Steelers have signed other defensive linemen to third contracts when they were in their 30s. In fact, a couple of them played so deep into their 30s that they blocked Heyward from entering the starting lineup until his third season. Aaron Smith signed a five-year contract when he was 31, the same age Heyward will turn in May. Brett Keisel also signed a five-year contract when he was 31. Smith played until he was 36 and Keisel until he was 35.</p>
<p>“I remember Brett telling me a few years ago, ‘You haven’t hit your prime yet,’ ” Heyward said. “I’m thinking, ‘I’m playing pretty good. What does your prime look like?’</p>
<p>“Hopefully, I’m taking the next step and there is more to come. I know football doesn’t last forever, but I’m trying to hold off retirement for as long as possible.”</p>
<p>Smith’s final years were marred by injuries. He played in just 15 games over his final three seasons. But Keisel remained productive well into his mid-30s. He started all 16 games in 2012 when he was 34 years old and registered 4½ sacks. He started all 12 games he played in during the 2013 season and had 4 sacks.</p>
<p>“My goal is to have a couple of Super Bowls at the end of this,” Heyward said. “I want to play at a high level. I don’t ever want it to be a thing where I’m struggling to get up. I’m going to do it for as long as I can, but I will know when the time comes.”</p>
<p>If Heyward is first in line this offseason, outside linebacker T.J. Watt won’t be far behind. He has two years remaining on his rookie contract, but he’s played so well the Steelers are looking to lock him up early. Watt is coming off a breakout season in which he registered 14½ sacks, forced eight fumbles and recovered four fumbles. He is among the candidates to win NFL defensive player of the year award, which will be announced next week at the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Watt’s negotiation figures to be a little trickier considering he’s in line to be paid among the top edge rushers in the league. Khalil Mack, Demarcus Lawrence and Frank Clark all make more than $20 million a year. Five others, including Von Miller and Cameron Jordan, all make more than $17 million per season.</p>
<p>It’s a bit out of the ordinary for the Steelers to give a new contract to a player with two years left on his rookie contract, but it’s not unprecedented. They did it with Antonio Brown in 2012 when they could not come to terms with Mike Wallace on a new contract. The Steelers rewarded Brown with a new deal after only two seasons.</p>
<p>Watt is scheduled to make just a shade under $3 million in 2020. The fifth-year option on his rookie contract in 2021 would likely be between $10 and $11 million although that number could change if a new collective bargaining agreement is reached before then.</p>
<p>Contract talks haven’t begun yet, and Watt seemed more concerned about the Steelers bringing back Dupree, who is a candidate to get the franchise tag in a few weeks.</p>
<p>“It would be huge to have Bud back,” Watt said. “I’m a big advocate for Bud Dupree. He had a hell of a season. He’s continuing to get better. It’s not just the sacks and the pass rush. He plays the run really well, too. He’s a really stout defender for the team. Obviously, I would love to have him back, but it’s not my decision. They know how I feel about him.”</p>
