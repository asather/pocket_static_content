<h1>Sweat Equity: Chris Ivey | paying the rent while chronicling the disenfranchised</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The late historian and activist Howard Zinn titled his influential memoir “You Can’t Be Neutral on a Moving Train.” Pittsburgh-based filmmaker and activist Chris Ivey is the public embodiment of that ethic.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old Monroe, N.C., native, who first came to Pittsburgh in 1995, has grown into the role that has made him one of the most ubiquitous witnesses to injustice in the region. He’s never neutral, and he has a camera.</p>
<p>In fact, every time Mr. Ivey picks up a movie camera, it is an act of fierce community witness. If you ask him why he’s so intense, he’ll tell you he’s committed to being a witness to the bigotry he sees without any regard to those in power it may embarrass. With his camera, he has explored the callousness of gentrification and the corporate nihilism of environmental racism and the many petty antagonisms in between.</p>
<p>Beginning with his award-winning documentary series “East of Liberty” in 2005, the one-time commercial TV director began to find his true voice after getting what he calls a glimpse of the propaganda undergirding Pittsburgh’s politics.</p>
<p>Huge swaths of economic marginalization in the region attest to Mr. Ivey’s suspicion that Democratic party apathy, corporate dominance and electoral nepotism conspire to deliver a one-two punch to the aspirations of ordinary working people in general and black people in particular.</p>
<p>“For me growing up [in N.C.], racism was always upfront,” Mr. Ivey said, recalling robed Klan members hawking pro-Confederate newspapers outside of Kmart. “We knew what we were dealing with. Coming up here, the racism is hidden and invisible, but it is deeply ingrained in the structure of the city. This city is extremely segregated.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ivey’s critique goes far beyond an observation about the lack of diverse neighborhoods to the lack of diversity in the city’s political and corporate leadership, especially the C-suites, boardrooms and private clubs where the decisions are made that affect all of our lives.</p>
<p>He believes being “politely” marginalized over decades has been hard on black people from here because they have never experienced an alternative to white domination in every sphere of civic and cultural life — with the exception of professional sports, where blacks are allowed to shine.</p>
<p>He points to various benchmark reports about Pittsburgh lagging in quality of life metrics for black people, a statistical bundling of reality he takes personally.</p>
<p>That’s why every conversation with Mr. Ivey circles back in some way to what he considers the symbol of our regional brutality — the shameful indifference to the treatment of black women in “America’s Most Livable City.”</p>
<p>“For me, it’s very important that black women be allowed to have their space and dignity and be very comfortable,” he said, referring to an all-black female forum he tried to film recently. Initially, he was prevented from entering the room for reasons of gender and the desire of the participants not to have the flow of their discussions interrupted.</p>
<p>Mr. Ivey and his camera crew were eventually allowed to film the last 40 minutes of the gathering he described as “raw” and unfiltered. For him, capturing the emotion in the room was just as important as capturing the words said.</p>
<p>“The most powerful segment in my new [video] installation ‘We Are Here,’ is ‘The Silence of Black Women Dying,’” he said. It is a section featuring an interview with a woman talking about all the black women she knows who have been murdered locally in the past three years with no media coverage.</p>
<p>The piece has exhibited at the Mattress Factory and in London. He plans to take it to Cape Town, South Africa, where he works for several weeks a year.</p>
<p>Chris Ivey began his career in Pittsburgh in 2001 as a conventional commercial director. His corporate clients included Bayer Healthcare, the Smithsonian, WBZZ-B94, Sneaker Villa, Allegheny Council for Regional Development, Cricket Wireless, the Port Authority of Allegheny County, The Sprout Fund, Ellen DeGeneres and Pittsburgh Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.</p>
<p>In 2001, he won an Addy award, an honor given to commercial advertising directors, for his humorous Jones Soda campaign. He won again in 2003 for his Washington Wild Things baseball club promos. Yet his success in advertising competitions wasn’t translating locally.</p>
<p>“I would win the award,” he said, “but I couldn’t get any work [in Pittsburgh].”</p>
<p>Over drinks one night, a colleague in the local advertising world told him that his relative youth at the time and his race had put him outside the realm of serious consideration for some potential clients. While stunned, he wasn’t devastated. If anything, the clarity of his situation made it possible — and necessary — to chart a new direction.</p>
<p>There was more than one way to pay the rent.</p>
<p>Along with his music video assignments, Mr. Ivey began adding educational and nonprofit commercial/documentary advertising work to his portfolio. He also began applying for — and getting — local grants from the city’s major foundations.</p>
<p>He could stitch together enough work to pay his bills, but he knew he wasn’t going to get the big paychecks his white colleagues would from corporate Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>While working for East Liberty Development Inc. chronicling the demolition of high-rises in the community in 2005, Mr. Ivey stumbled upon the story that would become the subject of his long-running series “East of Liberty” — the massive displacement of the neighborhood’s original tenants by gentrification. Mr. Ivey and East Liberty Development parted ways, and a genre of local guerrilla documentaries was born.</p>
<p>In the 15 years since he began chronicling the lives of the disenfranchised, his skill as a filmmaker has grown along with his business opportunities.</p>
<p>He has worked on dozens of projects and exhibited around the world. He’s lectured in Europe and in Appalachia. While he doesn’t apply for grants anymore, he is supported by generous donations to his company, Hyperboy Media and Films. He still does steady commercial work for local politicians such as state Reps. Summer Lee and Sara Innamorato and has done work for Allegheny County Controller Chelsa Wagner and Court of Common Pleas Judge Hugh McGough.</p>
<p>His life would’ve been a lot easier and his wallet a lot thicker if his art were less political, but he doesn’t mind. A day doesn’t go by when he isn’t inspired to film some aspect of real life, whether it is a protest on behalf of Antwon Rose II or children playing in the middle of a neighborhood street.</p>
<p>Asked what the biggest misconception about him is, Mr. Ivey smiles and says without a hint of irony: “That I’m the angriest person in black Pittsburgh.” He laughs when he says it, knowing that only the people who know him best will believe him.</p>
