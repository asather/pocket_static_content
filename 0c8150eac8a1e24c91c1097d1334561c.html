<h1>Sidney Crosby missed practice Sunday, and the Penguins' depth is already being tested</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sidney Crosby did not practice Sunday in Cranberry, a day after the star Penguins center departed an intrasquad scrimmage with an apparent injury.</p>
<p>Crosby left Saturday’s scrimmage midway through the second of two 25-minute periods. He skated off the ice, grabbed his sticks and walked toward the locker room at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex. He did not return to the ice.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan, in accordance with the NHL’s new injury and illness policy during the COVID-19 pandemic, said after Saturday’s scrimmage that he was “not permitted to comment” on why his captain suddenly left practice. Conor Sheary, Crosby’s linemate, speculated that it was “just a maintenance thing.”</p>
<p>With Crosby not practicing Sunday, Evan Rodrigues got an opportunity to skate in Crosby’s place on the top line with Jake Guentzel and Sheary. Rodrigues, whom the Penguins acquired in February from the Buffalo Sabres, had been playing right wing on the third line during the first few practices of training camp.</p>
<p>A week into camp, the Penguins are already down 10 players. Patric Hornqvist, Juuso Riikola and seven others have yet to practice with the team as they are being held out due to potential secondary exposure to COVID-19. Sullivan had just 12 forwards to work with Sunday, with Game 1 of the postseason play-in round vs. Montreal now 13 days away.</p>
<p>The Penguins acquired Rodrigues at the trade deadline with this sort of situation in mind. No, they didn’t expect him to produce like a Hall of Famer. But during his five seasons in Buffalo, the Sabres trusted him to fill a number or roles.</p>
<p>Rodrigues, who made it to the NHL despite going undrafted, skated at each of the three forwards spots there. He played on all four forward lines, including skating as the No. 1 center in a game against the Penguins last season when Sabres star Jack Eichel was sidelined. He killed penalties and got power-play time.</p>
<p>“I pride myself on being able to play all three positions and up and down the lineup,” Rodrigues said. “Versatility is something that I’m bringing to the table and hopefully it will help out this team. Anything I can do to help us win games and take us to the ultimate goal, winning a Stanley Cup, I'm willing to do.”</p>
<p>The 26-year-old has played seven games for Pittsburgh and stood out in the final two. He scored his first goal in the March 10 win in New Jersey. Two days later, the season came to a halt. After a long layoff, Rodrigues thinks the return-to-play process has been beneficial, giving him more time to get comfortable.</p>
<p>“I think coming back from our hiatus, it was almost like starting fresh. It’s almost like a second season here,” Rodrigues said. “It’s been good to be around the guys a lot. ... It’s made the transition to being part of this team a lot easier.”</p>
<p>Circumstances have created an opening for another depth forward in rookie Sam Lafferty. Lafferty looked to be at best the 15th forward on the organizational depth chart when the Penguins brought in Rodrigues, Sheary and Patrick Marleau at the trade deadline. Now he’s skating on the third line in camp.</p>
<p>He was one of the standouts of Saturday’s scrimmage, scoring a goal and setting up Jake Guentzel on a 2-on-1 when filling in for Crosby on the top line. He played with more decisiveness, twice blowing by smaller defenders on the rush.</p>
<p>“He plays a power game,” Sullivan said Saturday. “When he’s physical, he’s strong on pucks and he’s using his speed to challenge defensemen wide or to force turnovers by closing on defensemen and making it hard on their breakouts.”</p>
<p>The absences of Crosby and Hornqvist have had a trick-down effect on special teams, too. Those two are power-play regulars, buzzing around the crease.</p>
<p>During Sunday’s special-teams drills, Sullivan started with two defensemen, Kris Letang and Justin Schultz, on the power play. He soon subbed in Jason Zucker for Schultz, giving the winger his first shifts with the top unit in this camp.</p>
<p>Two of Zucker’s six goals in 15 games since coming over from the Minnesota Wild came on the power play. He was on the second unit when the season halted.</p>
<p>The Penguins are scheduled to play another scrimmage Monday in Cranberry.</p>
