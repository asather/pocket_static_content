<h1>Obituary: Anya Vasilis Dobratz / Dog breeder, handler fulfilled dream of winning championship</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Anya Vasilis Dobratz died doing what she loved.</p>
<p>Only days before she suffered fatal injuries in a vehicle accident in South Carolina, the 34-year-old earned her first “bred, owned and handled by” championship at the largest dog show in the Southeastern U.S.</p>
<p>“It was one of the biggest achievements in her life,” said her friend Pat Zapf, of Sewickley. “I remember her texting me —&nbsp;she was so excited, and she had so many hopes and dreams.”</p>
<p>A professional dog handler and breeder, Mrs. Dobratz had been attending the Florida Gulf Coast Cluster Dog Show in Brooksville, Fla., where she showed six dogs belonging to other people and her own champion, Heathcliff, a 15-month-old male German shepherd.</p>
<p>“Her lifelong dream was to have a champion that was owned, bred and handled by her,” said her husband, Eric Dobratz. “She was proud of herself; that was the goal she was working towards.”</p>
<p>On the way home to Swissvale in the early morning hours of Jan. 22, a converted box truck driven by Mrs. Dobratz ran off U.S. Highway 21 and struck a culvert in Branchville, S.C. She died of blunt force injuries, according to the Orangeburg County Coroner’s office, which is investigating the accident.</p>
<p>The dogs in the back of the truck weren’t injured, but one managed to escape and was later safely recovered.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dobratz remodeled the 15-foot box truck and sometimes spent the night with her charges as she toured across the country most weekends, said her husband.</p>
<p>“She converted it to use as a motor home and for dog transport,” he said.</p>
<p>Also a German shepherd breeder and well-known bicycle mechanic at several local shops, Mrs. Dobratz stepped away from other activities in recent years to focus on showing dogs, Mr. Dobratz said.</p>
<p>“She recently decided to go from recreational to full-time work, handling other people’s dogs,” he said.</p>
<p>And she was at the pinnacle of her profession, appearing at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show —&nbsp;the Super Bowl of annual dog shows —&nbsp;for the past several years, including last year when she handled Ms. Zapf’s Australian shepherd, Trump.</p>
<p>The dog —&nbsp;named for the playing card, not the president —&nbsp;won best in breed and competed for the coveted best in show on television last year, Ms. Zapf said.</p>
<p>“Getting best of breed was also one of Anya’s goals, and she achieved that last year,” Ms. Zapf said. “I have a video of her crying when she won. I think that’s the happiest I ever saw her.”</p>
<p>“She was a very talented animal handler,” her husband said. “Sometimes, it takes that little extra bit of human interaction to make dogs stand out, and she had a gift in that regard.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Dobratz was looking forward to the Westminster show next month at Madison Square Garden in New York, where she was planning to handle another German shepherd and reconnect with old friends, Ms. Zapf said.</p>
<p>“When you show dogs you’re usually going to the same dog shows, and so many people loved Anya,” she said. “It’s a very nomadic lifestyle. A professional handler is on the road pretty much every weekend.”</p>
<p>As a child, Mrs. Dobratz loved animals, and it was her first pet that inspired her to begin showing dogs, her husband said.</p>
<p>“Her mother got her an elkhound, and she decided she wanted to show it,” he said. “She saw her mother showing horses.”</p>
<p>A lover of reptiles, insects and isopods, Mrs. Dobratz had a quirky personality that was irresistible, her husband said.</p>
<p>“She had a job feeding snakes at a snake farm —&nbsp;that’s the kind of woman she was,” he said. “She didn’t fall into the stereotypical gender roles. It was one of the things that attracted me to her.”</p>
<p>The couple, who also own two cats and two motorcycles, met through mutual friends in the bicycle world and married in 2012.</p>
<p>“Anya was a unique woman,” recalled Ms. Zapf, who related a favorite memory of the time her friend stopped at a roadside cow statue when the two were driving to South Dakota. “She made us pull over and take photos with the giant cow. She loved things that were kind of strange and weird.”</p>
<p>Extroverted and gregarious, she could strike up a conversation with just about anyone.</p>
<p>“Anya was the most outgoing, friendly person you’d ever meet,” she said. “She was just a really positive person. She loved karaoke, cheap yellow beer and all animals. If you wanted to have a good time, you called Anya.”</p>
<p>Awareness and education about purebred dogs was important to Mrs. Dobratz, friends and family said.</p>
<p>“Anya was a champion for the purebred dog and dog ownership,” Ms. Zapf said.</p>
<p>“She was very passionate that people should know about dog breeds and behavior,” her husband said. “She didn’t care if it was popular.”</p>
<p>As a way of honoring Mrs. Dobratz, her loved ones plan to pick up where she left off with Heathcliff by stepping in to show him on the judging circuit.</p>
<p>“She wanted to win an all-breed best in show handling him,” Ms. Zapf said about Heathcliff, who even has financial sponsors to support his show career. “We’re going to try to make him what she always wanted him to be.”</p>
<p>“He is a very promising show dog,” Mr. Dobratz said. “We’re definitely going to honor her wishes in any way that we can.”</p>
<p>Along with her husband, Mrs. Dobratz is survived by her parents, Cynthia Johansson Vasilis, of Brackenridge, and Stelios Vasilis, of Athens, Greece; and her brother, Johnny Vasilis, of Athens.</p>
<p>Friends will be received for a memorial gathering on Feb. 8 from noon to 2 p.m. at the Thomas L. Nied Funeral Home, 7441 Washington St., Swissvale.</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions can be made to Orangeburg County, S.C., animal control and shelter via PayPal using fortheloveofapaw@gmail.com.</p>
