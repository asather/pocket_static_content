<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Seegrid, a Findlay-based company that develops autonomous vehicles for handling materials in factories and warehouses, announced it closed on a $52 million funding round Tuesday.</p>
<p>The latest investment is part of a funding round first announced in March, when G2VP, a venture firm based in Menlo Park, Calif., put $25 million toward the company.</p>
<p>Seegrid plans to use the new funds to accelerate new product development, to finance potential acquisitions in the future and to grow its workforce. Already, the company reported a 35% increase in employee headcount for 2019 last December.</p>
<p>Founded in 2003, Seegrid’s technology was first created from research at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. The autonomous, vision-guided vehicles are meant to increase productivity, improve safety and reduce labor costs for manufacturing, warehousing and logistics.</p>
<p>Customers have driven more than 3 million autonomous miles in Seegrid’s machines, according to a press release.</p>
<p>The company works with businesses across different industries, including Amazon, Whirlpool, Goodyear, GM and BMW, and O’Hara-based Giant Eagle.</p>
<p>With the latest announcement, it has $150 million in total funding, according to a spokesperson for the company.</p>
