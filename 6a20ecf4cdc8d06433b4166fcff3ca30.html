<h1>Small promoters in peril? Pittsburgh's concert presenters beg to differ</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rolling Stone magazine grabbed people’s attention Wednesday morning, tweeting, “The music business won’t ever be the same again — even after concerts come back.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/music-crisis-concerts-tours-980968/" target="_blank">The story details how the live music industry shut down</a>, starting in early March with the cancellation of Austin’s South by Southwest, followed soon after by industry giants Live Nation and AEG putting their tours on hold.</p>
<p>Thus far, major tours by superstars like The Rolling Stones, Roger Waters, The Who and Elton John have been postponed or canceled during what looked to be a plentiful year for concerts.</p>
<p>Pollstar projected that live music would generate $12.2 billion in box-office revenue in 2020. That would drop by $5.2 billion if concerts begin in late August and $8.9 billion if the shutdown runs through December.</p>
<p>In what way would the music business never be the same?</p>
<p>The story points to concert live streaming, which has flourished during the quarantine, becoming an alternative for fans and artists who don’t want to venture back into venues.</p>
<p>It also quotes Kevin Kennedy, an industry analyst at the research firm IBIS World, saying that while Live Nation and AEG are essentially to big to fail, independent promoters may be “in peril.”</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, clubs and small theaters thrive in the hands of several long-running independent promoters: Opus One Productions books Mr. Smalls and partners with AEG on shows, including much of the Stage AE lineup; Drusky Entertainment focuses on the Carnegie of Homestead Music Hall, Jergel’s, The Palace Theater and Highmark Stadium, among others; Elko Concerts also books the Palace; and Grey Area Productions books the Roxian and Rex Theater.</p>
<p>“The important part to realize is AEG and Live Nation own basically all the other ancillary aspects of the business,” Mr. Kennedy says. “In terms of the bargaining power they have, that’s only going to amplify. These smaller players are going to die off. If they survive, what’s the competition going to look like? It’s going to be skewed for the bigger guys. They’re going to have a lot more leverage in signing artists.”</p>
<p>Die off?</p>
<p>“A small company like mine should be able to weather the storm until the live music industry is open for business again,” says Ben Penigar, of Gray Area. “What that business will look like by the time we are able to attend shows again is anyone's guess, but absolutely no one knows definitively what will happen. Speculating on the future of our industry at this point is both dangerous and irresponsible.”</p>
<p>Brian Drusky, who launched Drusky Entertainment in 2006, has had to postpone, cancel and reschedule more than 90 concerts since the outbreak, but he&nbsp;doesn’t believe he’s in peril.</p>
<p>“Those smaller promoters who may live week to week, month to month, and don't have a solid base of which to run their company, it may be hard [for them] to sustain through no income for a while,” he says.</p>
<p>Mike Elko of Elko Concerts, who has moved 48 shows in Pittsburgh and Florida since mid-March, says, “I am in good shape.”</p>
<p>There are advantages to being an indie promoter while we wait out this pandemic. They have small staffs and low overhead. They’re not paying debt or maintenance on brick-and-mortar venues. And, unlike Live Nation, which is a public company, as opposed to the AEG, they don’t have stockholders.</p>
<p>It’s not certain that any of that business is coming back in 2020.</p>
<p>“In the long run,” Mr. Drusky says, “it may have more of an effect on job security of employees at larger promoters. Some excess might start being trimmed if this thing lasts a longer than expected.”</p>
<p>As of now, Drusky is wiping out its May concerts.</p>
<p>“I'm still hopeful mid-June, but that's just speculation,” he says. “No one really knows. It's nothing we've dealt with before. There are experts saying not till fall of 2021 for concerts and sporting events, but I think that is unrealistic as well. I think in some form it will be back a lot sooner than that. We'll follow what the CDC and the government says and move on from there as best we can. Will it be reversed of how it closed, like smaller clubs OK, then on to theaters and eventually arenas, amphitheaters, etc.? That could be a distinct possibility.”</p>
