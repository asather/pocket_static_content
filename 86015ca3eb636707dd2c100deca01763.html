<h1>Arrest warrant issued for Antonio Brown: report</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An arrest warrant has been issued for former Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown, according to reports from Florida media.</p>
<p>The warrant is for burglary and battery, in reference to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/22/Antonio-Brown-police-investigation-incident-Florida-home/stories/202001220098" target="_blank">an incident on Tuesday</a>, and was issued by Hollywood police, according to the document posted by Andy Slater, a talk show host with FoxSports640.</p>
<p>Slater said there is no bond.</p>
<p>ESPN reporter Cameron Wolfe, who was on the scene outside Brown’s home on Tuesday, confirmed Slater’s report and said the charge stems from the incident with the moving truck driver.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Brown and his trainer, Glen Holt, were at Brown’s home in Florida when the pair were accused of battering the driver of a moving truck Brown had called to the home, local police told ESPN.</p>
<p>Police said they were unable to make contact with Brown on Tuesday. Holt was taken into custody for felony burglary and battery.</p>
<p>Police told USA Today that Brown had locked himself in his house on Tuesday as the assault was being investigated.</p>
<p>Brown was seen last week on his own Instagram Live shouting at police and the mother of some of his children in an apparent dispute over his car keys. Since then, his agent Drew Rosenhaus <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/16/antonio-brown-drew-rosenhaus-logan-paul-fight-youtube/stories/202001160154" target="_blank">ended his relationship</a> with the former Steelers star. He also reportedly wrote to the NFL Players’ Association that he would represent Brown again if he got mental help.</p>
<p>The NFL is investigating Brown after his former trainer Brittney Taylor accused him of rape and sexual assault in September. That investigation has not concluded.</p>
