<p>As the state and its counties continue to refine how they report data, the state and region saw revised totals for its death tolls on Thursday.</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s death toll dropped after its health department said it “identified a number of duplicates.” The removal of the duplicates means there are five less deaths than Wednesday, and the count has been adjusted to 69 total deaths (as opposed to the 74 reported on Wednesday).</p>
<p>Statewide, the number of deaths was adjusted to 1,394 confirmed fatalities, more than 200 less than Wednesday’s 1,622.</p>
<p>Based on the latest figures released Thursday, the county reported 61 new cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Since the first case was confirmed on March 14, the county has had 1,149 cases — 1,119 were confirmed and 30 are probable. The total is an increase from 1,088 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Of the county’s deaths, 62 were confirmed and seven were probable.</p>
<p>Allegheny County has the highest totals in Western Pennsylvania.&nbsp;Philadelphia County has the state’s highest totals in cases and deaths, with 10,090 and 271, respectively.</p>
<p>There are 37,053 cases — confirmed and probable — in Pennsylvania. The new cases were 1,369 more than Wednesday’s total of 35,684.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Western Pennsylvania, there were new death counts reported in each of the following counties: Allegheny (-5), Beaver (-1) and Butler (-1), Lawrence (-1) and Westmoreland (+1).&nbsp;</p>
