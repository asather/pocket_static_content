<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: Should Steelers have been awarded a forfeit?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Geno:</strong> Do you believe the NFL has an agenda against the Steelers? They should have been awarded a forfeit. And now the commissioner says the Titans might have to forfeit their next game. It isn’t fair. Why does the NFL not give the Steelers the same respect it does other teams like the Patriots?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> An agenda against the Steelers? Is this a serious question? The Steelers are one of the signature franchises, Art Rooney is one of the most powerful owners and Mike Tomlin is one of the most powerful voices among coaches. What are you talking about? The NFL hasn’t given out a forfeit yet and I will be shocked if it does. And if so it is only because, unlike Steelers-Titans, there aren’t other alternatives for some of these games to be rescheduled. The NFL didn’t want to cancel a game. It wants all teams to play 16 games. I am not sure what that has to do with disrespecting or short-changing the Steelers. The Steelers will be fine. They play 13 weeks in a row which is something many teams have done in the past. It isn’t that big of a deal. The NFL should have had one or two weeks at the end of the season that were designated as makeup weekends and this wouldn’t even be an issue.</p>
<p><strong>JaMoney:</strong> Are the Steelers a legitimate Super Bowl contender at this point? I don’t think so. I think a lot of people are going to be very disappointed in a few weeks when reality hits. Are you really buying James Conner making it through the season healthy?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I think as long as Patrick Mahomes is playing quarterback for the Chiefs and is healthy this season, everyone else is playing for second place in the AFC. The Steelers are definitely one of the best teams in the AFC, I just don’t think they are better than the Chiefs. The scary thing about Kansas City is they showed against Baltimore what they can be if they are dialed in and ready to play. This weekend they showed they can win even when they don’t play well or don’t look particularly interested. That is scary. They are going to be a very difficult out.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> You give Pitt no respect ever and you never have even when you were a beat reporter. You always look to criticize them. You and your boy Ron Cook couldn’t wait for them to lose, right? Why don’t you write about how good Kenny Pickett played instead of talking about how they had a bad loss? What is your issue with Pitt? You are probably a Penn State graduate just like Cook and Mike White.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Sigh. I went to Point Park then did my masters at Temple. My dad went to Pitt and I grew up going to Pitt games. My son played for Pitt. But yes, let’s go with I have an agenda against Pitt. And Ron Cook went to Northwestern and Mike White went to Duquesne, but yes, they have an agenda against Pitt, too. Good lord. Stop being so sensitive. It isn’t negative to point out that Pitt lost a game that it was supposed to win. That’s called reporting and commenting on the news. That’s what we do here.</p>
<p><strong>Jared:</strong> Why can’t Pitt ever just win all the games they are supposed to win? It is the same thing every single year. I am tired of cheering for this team every year and getting let down.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> It is one of life’s mysteries for sure. This has been going on since 1983 and has spanned countless coaches, players, athletic directors, school presidents, stadiums and facilities. There isn’t any rhyme or reason to it, it just seems to be Pitt’s curse.</p>
<p><strong>TJ from Cali:</strong> Do you agree the biggest problem Pitt has is they don’t have enough talent and their assistant coaches are pedestrian? They need to start paying some real money for better assistants or they will always lose these games because the head coach is clueless. I almost bought into the Pitt hype, almost. The question is why did you?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I don’t know, Mark Whipple is very accomplished as a coach. Randy Bates, I think, is excellent. Charlie Partridge is one of the best defensive line coaches in the country and should be on deck for another shot at a head coaching job. The staff is very good and Pitt pays them well. The talent is there, too. There is just something that is missing, but as I said to the previous question, it always seems to be missing at Pitt. I can’t explain it.</p>
<p><strong>Greg:</strong> Hey dope, are you still a Narduzzi fan? I bet you will weasel out of answering this. If you can’t see that he is a horrible head coach that should be fired, you are blind. N.C. State, that’s all I need to say.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Wow. Pat Narduzzi has some shortcomings as a head coach. But he has done a good job of building an organization and program. He has recruited well. His players graduate and don’t get in trouble. He has the program stable and now the hope is stability will bring consistency. It is ludicrous to think about firing him now unless the floor absolutely drops out of this season. He has the program on the right path.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> With the NBA doing their worst ratings in 40 years since they resumed play, do you think they will stop the divisive on the court social justice grandstanding next season?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Well I am sure you are happy to know that Adam Silver has said the social justice measures will be scaled back next year. That’s not the main issue, though I do think there has been some — perhaps small — negative effect on viewership. The larger issues are the time of year, the crowded sports calendar, the uninteresting basketball because too many big names are hurt or out of the bubble, a drab Eastern Conference opponent, LeBron fatigue, people are watching sports in general less since COVID, the election, etc.. There are many, many factors in the TV ratings declining.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> Paul, I heard your tribute to Eddie Van Halen tonight on The Fan. It was great stuff, he was indeed a legend. What are your favorite Van Halen songs? Where do you rank Eddie among all-time guitarists? And of course, Van Halen or Van Hagar?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I’ll go backward. I love both Van Halen and Van Hagar and think Van Hagar gets a bad rap as being too “bubble gum.” Both eras were tremendous. As for rankings, he is somewhere in the top five or six with Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Keith Richards. Favorite songs? “Hot for Teacher” is tremendous, just because of that scene from Varsity Blues. There are way too many great songs to list.</p>
<p><strong>JacobK:</strong> Do you have any thoughts on Randy Waldrum taking the position as the head coach of Nigerian national team?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Not really. It seems like a great honor. I will say he has done an incredible job with the Pitt’s women’s soccer program. Pitt has made some excellent hires in recent years for these Olympic sports.</p>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Did you see the story about Dabo Swinney looking to make the jump to the NFL? You have often said that every NFL job is better than every college job, but how could taking over the Jets or Lions be better than the situation he has? He makes about $9 million, so money is not an issue for Clemson.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> As I always say, the NFL can pay even more than that and he won’t have to recruit, fundraise, worry about compliance issues, deal with administration, deal with academic stuff, deal with boosters and a bunch of other stuff that has nothing to do with coaching football. In the NFL, he coaches football and that’s all he worries about.</p>
