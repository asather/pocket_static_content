<h1>As Trump urges quick deadline, Census workers rush to count 100% in lagging communities</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON — Liberty, Lincoln and Port Vue celebrated last week with grant money won in a contest that encouraged people to respond to the U.S. Census. In Homestead, a “pop-up block party” beckoned people to fill out the government questionnaires with live outdoor performances by DJs and spoken word artists.</p>
<p>Local officials in the Pittsburgh region raced last week to wrap up the once-in-a-decade population count that&nbsp;determines congressional representation, the distribution of $1.5 trillion in annual federal spending, and the allocation of local resources and economic development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh region as a whole appeared to be headed to meet or exceed the rates of self-response achieved during the 2010 census&nbsp;— even as the Trump administration pushed the 2020 Census count to wrap up early. A federal judge Friday ordered the administration to allow Census work to continue until Oct. 31.</p>
<p>But more than two dozen towns, including the City of Pittsburgh, were falling behind the self-response rates from a decade ago, according to an analysis of Census count data. Census enumerators have faced compounded challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened distrust of government amid political polarization, and confusion over the shifting federal deadlines to wrap up work, local officials said in interviews.</p>
<p>“We don’t know where the issues are going to be with geographic areas not responding,” said Bob Gradeck, project manager of the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center at the University of Pittsburgh. “That is a big question mark. Where are they missing people?”</p>
<p>“The biggest thing that worries me at this point is the accelerated timetable — and the usual checks they put on quality control and the work they put into verifying a lot of this, just may not be there,” he said.</p>
<p>Allegheny County, in recent days, edged past its 2010 self-response rate, reporting 71.8% of county residents had filled out the forms online, by phone or by mail as of Sept. 29. Local officials described an unprecedented level of coordination among civic groups to raise awareness.</p>
<p>But there were pockets of undercounted places, municipalities, according to a Post-Gazette analysis of the data. Wilmerding, Pitcairn, North Braddock, McKeesport, Braddock and East Pittsburgh were all more than 8 percentage points behind the 2010 mark.</p>
<p>Adding to the uncertainty, the self-response rates leave out crucial data on total progress toward a complete count. The results of enumerators’ follow-up attempts — such as door-knocking campaigns that were scaled back amid the pandemic’s social distancing restrictions — are not widely available at the local level.</p>
<p>The low self-response rates, together with the data gaps, raise questions whether the areas in most need of assistance will end up with inaccurate counts that could shortchange them in myriad ways for the next decade.</p>
<p>Tammy Firda, president of the Steel Rivers Council of Governments and longtime Lincoln council member, still harbored some doubts about whether many communities would reach their targets in the count, especially if the Oct. 5 date holds.</p>
<p>Ms. Firda pointed to the dearth of grocery stores in the Mon Valley as a problem that would be exacerbated by a lowball population count.</p>
<p>“I think they’re going to miss people in this count if they push to end it sooner rather than later,” Ms. Firda said, referring to some Mon Valley towns where pleas to fill out Census forms have gone unanswered.</p>
<p><strong>Changing deadlines</strong></p>
<p>The deadline to complete Census work has been subject to change. After COVID-19 shut down in-person events scheduled around its April 1 launch, the Trump administration agreed to extend the deadline by a month to Oct. 31, 2020, requiring totals be submitted to the White House by April 2021.</p>
<p>In August, the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census, reversed itself and moved the deadline back to Sept. 30. It required totals submitted to the White House by Dec. 31. That change drew a lawsuit from a coalition of advocacy groups, led by the National Urban League.</p>
<p>The coalition argued Mr. Trump wanted the Census counts quickly so he could control the apportionment of U.S. House seats, even if he loses reelection in November. The Census flip-flop, the lawsuit pointed out, came days after Mr. Trump signed a presidential memorandum that would exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted in congressional districts when they are redrawn next year.</p>
<p>On Sept. 24, a federal judge in California, granted a preliminary injunction, which suspended the Sept. 30 end date. The Trump administration appealed, and, days later, the Commerce Department set Oct. 5 as the end date.</p>
<p>On Friday, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in Northern California allowed work to continue through the rest of the month, calling the department’s deadline, announced in a one-sentence tweet, an “egregious” violation of her order.</p>
<p>The timeframe would allow much-needed time for a final push by enumerators who faced early setbacks.</p>
<p>“We lost probably about a month of startup time to even get out and even have the permission to go and do these onsite events,”&nbsp;said Sheila Beasley, a communications professional who was hired as the Pittsburgh Partnership Specialist for the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p><strong>Community building</strong></p>
<p>Ms. Beasley struck an optimistic note, saying Census workers have out-performed given the circumstances thanks in part to&nbsp;early preparation and coordination.</p>
<p>Ms. Beasley has appeared at in-person and virtual events for months and coordinated efforts with the Complete Count Committee, a group of 31 civic leaders that first met in October 2018. The committee is&nbsp;co-chaired by Stefani Pashman, CEO of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, and Gregg Behr, executive director of the Grable Foundation.</p>
<p>The outreach event in Homestead last week was organized by&nbsp;#BlackLivesCountPgh, which promoted the Census as “key to dismantling systemic racial&nbsp;inequities” and paired Census forms with voter registration.</p>
<p>“Between the pandemic and the social unrest and the protests, we were still squeezing in the Census,” Ms. Beasley said.</p>
<p>The Census allows people to fill out the questionnaires online, by phone or by mail. Census takers then begin visiting homes that had not responded to ask the necessary questions and input the answers onto a smartphone.</p>
<p>The follow-up work was originally scheduled for May 13 through July 31, and Census workers were permitted to visit homes a maximum of six times.</p>
<p>“The coupling of the election and the pandemic has created an extra layer of challenges and confusion for people who are unwilling to open their door to an enumerator,” Ms. Pashman said. “For communities that are less trusting of the Census, they are more reluctant within this environment to complete it.”</p>
<p>In early August, the committee identified the 29 zip codes with historically hard-to-count populations to focus efforts during the final weeks, Mr. Behr said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Whatever the deadline is, we’re going to run through that as hard and as fast as we can,” Mr. Behr said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With each day bringing in more responses, the accuracy of the count is at stake. Local officials push for returned questionnaires because they bring in the most accurate responses. The Census, using other data sources, will attempt to estimate the number of households that don’t respond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re still seeing that [self-response] number creep up,” said Jessica Mooney, manager of special projects in the county executive’s office.&nbsp;“We know there’s always room for improvement, and residents are still responding.”</p>
<p>For Ms. Beasley, the count has been an exercise of community building.</p>
<p>“This has been the most gratifying, climactic ending that I could’ve ever thought of,” she said.</p>
