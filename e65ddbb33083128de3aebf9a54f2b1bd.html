<h1>'He has a fresh start': Gov. Wolf signs pardon for McKeesport man denied council seat</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf has pardoned McKeesport barber Corry Sanders, who was elected to the local council five years ago but was denied his seat due to decades-old drug charges.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Board of Pardons <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/09/11/mckeesport-councilman-election-felony-disqualified-pardon-fetterman/stories/201909110145" target="_blank">voted unanimously in September 2019</a> to recommend that Mr. Sanders be pardoned.</p>
<p>According to Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, Mr. Sanders, 50, was “over the moon” after receiving his pardon in the mail earlier this week.</p>
<p>“He’s exactly the kind of person who could help a community like McKeesport,” Mr. Fetterman said during a phone interview Wednesday morning. “In 2019, he was discouraged because he was voted down. But I found out yesterday that the governor had finally signed it, and Corry got it in the mail yesterday.</p>
<p>“He has a fresh start, and a second chance after a drug conviction that dates back 30 years. I couldn’t be happier.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>​State law prohibits anyone convicted of a felony from serving in public office.​</p>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Court <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2016/02/24/Judge-Joseph-James-rules-McKeesport-councilman-elect-Corry-Sanders-can-t-be-seated-on-council/stories/201602240203" target="_blank">Senior Judge Joseph M. James ruled on Feb. 24, 2016</a>, that Mr. Sanders’ 1993 no-contest plea to felony drug charges made him ineligible to serve on council, despite him winning a November 2015 election.</p>
<p>Court documents showed that police suspected that Mr. Sanders dealt cocaine out of his house and, on four occasions, bought a total of $11,400 worth of the drug from an undercover officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders served prison time and was paroled in 1998.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders has said he has since turned his life around and now talks to kids about making good choices. He has owned a barbershop in McKeesport since 1999 and was a board member of the McKeesport Business Authority.</p>
<p>The Board of Pardons processes and signs off on all pardons before they are sent to the governor’s desk. Mr. Fetterman, chairman of the five-member board, had called the decision “appropriate.”&nbsp;The other members of the pardons board are state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a psychiatrist, a corrections expert and a victims advocate.</p>
