<h1>Fish and Boat satisfied with self-licensing language</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tim Schaeffer, executive director of the state Fish and Boat Commission, said the agency is satisfied with a recent change in state law that permits it to set its own license fees. Gov. Tom Wolf, however, is concerned the wording could still enable the state legislature to hold up Fish and Boat funding increases.</p>
<p>During years of contentious negotiations, lawmakers refused to increase fishing license fees fearing a backlash at the voting booth. Last month, the General Assembly sent a bill to the governor that gives the legislature oversight of license fees set by Fish and Boat for five years, and provides a “sunset provision” that will automatically end the experiment if lawmakers feel it isn’t working.</p>
<p>The governor allowed the bill to pass without his signature. An aide said Gov. Wolf supports Fish and Boat’s intention to set its fees but was opposed to language in the law that continues to put the agency at a potential funding disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Under the act, the Fish and Boat Commission has to wait the longer of 30 calendar days or 10 legislative session days for action by a legislative committee,” said a governor’s aide. “This could ... provide the General Assembly the opportunity to hold up the regulatory process by not convening session days.”</p>
<p>Mr. Schaeffer said the agency is OK with the language.&nbsp;“We’re not concerned about it. We’re confident in the process.”</p>
<p>He said he doesn’t believe lawmakers will want to delay Fish and Boat’s fee-setting process.</p>
<p>“We don’t think we’re going to ask for anything the legislature won’t approve of.”</p>
<p>The earliest that license fee changes would occur is the 2022 license year. The cost of an adult resident fishing license has been $22.90 since 2005.</p>
<p><strong>All-tackle experiment</strong></p>
<p>At their quarterly meeting Monday, Fish and Boat Commissioners approved a new “experimental” waterway designation. Under the proposal, a section of Bald Eagle Creek in Centre County would be managed as Miscellaneous Special Regulation, identical to the current Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only regulation, but all tackle would be permitted. The regulation would allow for year-round fishing with all tackle and harvest of up to three trout per day at least 9 inches in length from June 15 through Labor Day, with no harvest permitted the remainder of the year. If approved at a future meeting, the amendment would go into effect on Jan. 1, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Horsepower increase</strong></p>
<p>Fish and Boat tentatively approved an increase in horsepower at Shenango Reservoir in Mercer County. The 3,560-acre flood control project is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has maintained a 10-hp limit from the railroad causeway west to the Ohio line. Recently the Army Corps lifted the horsepower restriction on those waters and petitioned Fish and Boat to make the same change. The proposed amendment will be decided at a future commission meeting.</p>
