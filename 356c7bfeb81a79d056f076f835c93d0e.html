<h1>Coaches hope Marcus Allen's versatility helps carve out role with Steelers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nobody has ever questioned Marcus Allen’s energy or infectious enthusiasm, whether with the Steelers or on social media.</p>
<p>Nor has anyone ever debated his aggressive, hard-hitting style, which made him one of the nation’s top safeties at Penn State. In his four years as a collegiate starter, he never met a collision he didn’t like.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Allen has not been able to parlay any of that into playing time since he was drafted by the Steelers in the fifth round in 2018. But, in what is an important year for the former Penn State free safety, the Steelers are giving him a chance in training camp to change all that.</p>
<p>They are looking at him as a hybrid linebacker in their sub-package defenses, hoping his ability to run and penchant for hitting people can earn him some kind of role in their defense. It is the best opportunity Allen has been given in three years to get on the field and be a contributor.</p>
<p>According to his coaches, he is taking advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>“I think this is a big year for Marcus, and he’s taking advantage of a lot of different things,” said secondary coach Tom Bradley. “Marcus is really coming on strong during this camp.”</p>
<p>“I remember when I got into the league, they said it takes a couple years for some players to develop, and that’s hopefully what we are seeing right now,” said inside linebacker coach Jerry Olsavsky, who played nine seasons with the Steelers (1989-1997). “We are going to see Marcus really develop into a real professional.”</p>
<p>But maybe the most surprising — and significant — appraisal came from head coach Mike Tomlin, who said Allen offers more than the flexibility of being able to play two positions.</p>
<p>“I think he has shown an understanding of how he is communicating, whether it is at a linebacker or safety,” Tomlin said. “His pre-snap communication skills and the way that he adjusts shows growth and development in terms of our overall scheme, and that allows him to display the position flexibility.”</p>
<p>Allen has been given his longest looks at inside linebacker in training camp, and he has shown a little of everything. He has been beaten down the field by tight end Eric Ebron on several occasions in drills but has also shown an ability to deliver big hits whenever the opportunity has arisen.</p>
<p>In a drill in which linebackers try to use the boundary to stop running backs, Allen came up on Benny Snell and delivered a thundering hit — even though it was Snell, not Allen, who stayed on his feet. Allen can be so aggressive that coaches sometimes worry his teammates can be the victim of friendly fire.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing is, if you like playing football, how much you like hitting people,” Olsavsky said. “Marcus likes hitting people, so playing linebacker is no problem for him. He hasn’t done a lot of drills over his lifetime to play linebacker, but he’s doing a fine job.</p>
<p>“Bringing Marcus into my room really pumped up the room. It got all the other guys excited. I think it got the defense as a whole excited because now you get to see a guy and say, ‘Wow, that guy can really do some stuff.’ ”</p>
<p>Allen, the godson of Hall of Fame running back and former Pitt star Curtis Martin, has a natural way of getting those around him excited — even off the field. He has 156,000 followers on Instagram, where he frequently posts videos of himself dancing, working out and generally having fun.</p>
<p>The Steelers, though, have wanted to see him mature into his role and take his job as an NFL player more seriously. They are beginning to see that.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what his personality is, but he is a high-energy, football-playing son of a gun,” Olsavsky said. “And that’s what you like. That is probably why we drafted him.”</p>
<p>Before his final season at Penn State, Allen was considered one of the top free safety prospects in the country by some scouts and organizations. But a slow 40-time at his pro day (4.63), on top of having just one interception in four seasons as a starter with the Nittany Lions, dropped his draft stock. He was the 15th safety drafted in 2018.</p>
<p>It looked as though Allen’s career with the Steelers might come to a quick end when he was waived during the final cut of training camp last season. He lacked the speed to cover the deep middle of the field and was beaten out by Alliance of American Football product Kameron Kelly. However, the Steelers signed him to their practice squad the next day, not wanting to give up on him.</p>
<p>“Marcus has always had the physical skills to do both jobs, but intellectual skills, the overall understanding of the big picture allows those things to come out in a football way now,” Tomlin said.</p>
<p>At 6-foot-2, 216 pounds, the Steelers are giving him a chance to get on the field by using him as a hybrid linebacker in their dime defense. His competition is second-year linebacker Ulysees Gilbert III, a sixth-round draft choice from Akron in 2019.</p>
<p>Allen’s role as a backup safety was filled when the Steelers signed Curtis Riley, a former starter with the New York Giants and Oakland Raiders, last month. Still, his asset will be his ability to play two positions.</p>
<p>“One thing, he’s playing a lot faster this year,” said Bradley, who was gone from Penn State when Allen was a four-year starter with the Nittany Lions. “You can tell he really understands the system. He’s very versatile. We can do a lot of different things with him in our package.”</p>
