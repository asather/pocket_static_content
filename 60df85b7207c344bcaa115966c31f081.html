<h1>State-owned universities could see 350 faculty cuts, most in Western Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Approximately 350 state university professors — most on four Western Pennsylvania campuses — face layoffs after the spring semester’s end, as expedited State System of Higher Education plans to square revenues with costs take shape.</p>
<p>The cuts would bring faculty-student ratios more in line with enrollment declines over the last decade —&nbsp;part of a system redesign in the works since January 2017. The timeline to achieve that initially was five years, but Chancellor Daniel Greenstein condensed that to two years this spring as the pandemic compounded financial struggles at the 14 member universities.</p>
<p>Of the 350 total, about 220 layoffs would hit California, Clarion, Edinboro and Indiana University of Pennsylvania, confirmed Jamie Martin, president of the Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties and a professor at IUP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individual campus totals have evolved, but Ms. Martin said the reduction on her campus alone would represent about 25% of the teaching force at Western Pennsylvania’s largest State System university.</p>
<p>Layoff notices to tenured faculty on the seven campuses affected by the reductions must be sent out by Oct. 30 under collective bargaining agreement with the APSCUF. Notices for other faculty including adjuncts and probationary employees can be sent later in the academic year.</p>
<p>The layoffs coupled with faculty who accepted early retirement this year would suggest a reduction in teaching force of at least 10%, not counting attrition, but neither the system or union had a specific percentage Thursday.</p>
<p>State System enrollment reached nearly 120,000 students in 2010, but has declined since to nearly 96,000, about a 20% loss. Some individual campuses have seen far larger declines, including most in Western Pennsylvania. Officials cite as reasons population loss, competition and shifts in the higher education market.</p>
<p>State System officials have been mum on teaching force reductions developed by campuses as part of sustainability plans in recent months, calling those documents working drafts. On Thursday, spokesman David Pidgeon did not directly address the 350 total.</p>
<p>“The chancellor supports the State System and individual universities taking responsibility for putting public higher education on a financially sustainable path,” he said. “We’re collectively working to recapture our affordability edge so that students regardless of zip code can access a system university.”</p>
<p>He said average net price at State System universities in 2009 was $12,677, about $6,800 less than a state-related institution such as the University of Pittsburgh or Penn State and about $8,800 less compared to a private four-year college.</p>
<p>More recently, he said, the differences were about $2,000 less than a state-related and $2,700 less than a four-year college, according to 2018 data.</p>
<p>Though they blame decades of tepid state financial support, both management and union officials have acknowledged the need to square teaching ranks with enrollment trends, though some express concern about using the 2010-2011 academic year —&nbsp;when system enrollment peaked — as the standard.</p>
<p>The State System faculty-student-ratio that year was 21:1.</p>
<p>Rapid growth culminating that year left some classes bulging. In the years since, faculty ranks already have been lowered through attrition, including more than 200 faculty who signed up for a retirement incentive earlier this year.</p>
<p>Officials from APSCUF this week pointed to student-faculty ratios as of 2018 that indicated that State System average class sizes were greater than 17-to-1, versus 14- or 15-to-1 at the state-related universities including Pitt, Penn State, Temple and Lincoln universities.</p>
<p>Class sizes in 2018 also exceeded those at the State University of New York.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania State System is the least expensive option for a university degree in the Commonwealth, and Ms. Martin said her institutions work with many first-generation and other disadvantaged students to offer them a path to the middle class.</p>
<p>“Why are they less deserving of having smaller classes than students at Pitt or Penn State?” she asked.</p>
<p>The latest campus sustainability plans submitted to the State System last month leave much unclear, at least publicly, about where faculty and program cuts might occur. Humanities? Sciences? Athletics?</p>
<p>“We don’t know what areas they are targeting. We can’t engage in meaningful conversations about how to avoid this,” Ms. Martin said.</p>
<p>Adding to the uncertainty are plans to affiliate several campuses to shore up finances and create opportunities for new revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Western Pennsylvania, California, Clarion and Edinboro universities are to integrate, but questions remain including whether the entities will be accredited as a single body. If that happens, can the schools keep their names, identities and distinct academic and athletic programs? What will the schools be called and will it be an affiliation or a merger?</p>
<p>“Great questions, and that is what the ongoing review process is all about,” Mr. Pidgeon said. “I’m not certain but some of that may be addressed by Chancellor Greenstein at next week’s board meeting.”</p>
<p>The State System board meets Oct. 14 and 15.</p>
<p>Initially, presidents of 10 of the 14 State System campuses sent out notices in August about potential faculty retrenchment but Bloomsburg, Kutztown and Millersville universities rescinded those letters.</p>
<p>The seven still facing reductions are California, Cheyney, Clarion, Edinboro, Indiana, Lock Haven, and Mansfield universities.</p>
