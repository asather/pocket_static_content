<h1>Cases of COVID-19 at Bloomsburg University double in two days</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ninety individuals at Bloomsburg University have tested positive for COVID-19, all but one of them students, a total that roughly doubled in two days, according to officials at the state-owned university.</p>
<p>The surge prompted Bloomsburg, one 14 State System of Higher Education universities, to announce Thursday afternoon that it is shifting in-person classes already in progress to online delivery effective Monday and will decide by Sept. 21 how classes scheduled to begin Oct.&nbsp; 7 will be delivered.</p>
<p>Students already in residence halls will not be required to leave since some are from communities lacking good internet access or do not have adequate support to complete their studies remotely, officials said in a statement. Those who choose to go home will receive applicable refunds.</p>
<p>"I know that this announcement will be a disappointment to many of you, and I share your disappointment," Bloomsburg President Bashar Hanna told the campus. "But I am confident that we will work together in support of our students during this transition over the coming days, and throughout a successful fall semester."</p>
<p>The university said that among student cases, 14 are on-campus; 67 are off-campus; and eight are isolating in their hometown.</p>
<p>The university’s <a href="https://bloomu.edu/coronavirus" target="_blank">COVID-19 dashboard</a> says the cases reported include positive, laboratory-verified test results reported to the Bloomsburg’s Student Health Center or Office of Workplace Safety. The university’s cumulative dashboard, updated three times weekly, reported a single case, an employee, as of&nbsp; Aug. 14; 10 total cases as of Aug. 19; 39 total cases as of Monday, and 90, cumulatively, as of Wednesday.</p>
<p>The fall semester at Bloomsburg began Aug. 17, according to its web site.</p>
<p>Thomas McGuire, a Boomsburg spokesman, could not immediately be reached for comment or additional detail Thursday, nor could State System spokesman David Pidgeon.&nbsp;It was unclear how many cases are symptomatic.</p>
<p>Bloomsburg enrolls nearly 8,700 students and is located in Columbia County, north and east of Harrisburg.</p>
<p>Nationwide, colleges and universities for months have prepared complicated reopen plans, in part responding to student demand for a residential campus experience versus online instruction. But as cases of the virus spiked this summer in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, at least nine of Pennsylvania’s&nbsp;14 member universities moved away from most face-to-face instruction to mainly remote classes, keeping a number of students home.</p>
<p>The Western Pennsylvania campuses of Caifornia, Clarion, Edinboro, Indiana and Slippery Rock universities were among those moveing to online.</p>
<p>According to fall reopen plans on Bloomsburg’s web site, about 53% of classes are being delivered online, another 22% are a hybrid blend of in-person and remote and another&nbsp; 25% are face-to-face.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the nation, surges in cases on campuses have led to warnings from administrators, sanctions against students and individuals as well as changes to class delivery. The University of North Caroline at Chapel Hill switched its undergraduate fall semester online last week, after clusters of cases developed in residences and at least fraternity house.</p>
<p>”Due to the global pandemic, it should be assumed that the potential for COVID-19 exposure is everywhere.” Bloomsburg said on its website. “While there is public interest in knowing about positive cases, Bloomsburg University is obligated to protect the privacy of anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19.”</p>
<p>According to Bloomsburg’s site, on-campus students are recommended to go home for&nbsp;the duration of their quarantine or recovery. “A limited number of isolated rooms are available on campus for the duration of a specified quarantine period,” it states.</p>
<p>“Residence Life conducts in-person checks twice daily, meals are delivered, and the Student Health Center and/or campus health personnel conduct a daily check-in to support the student’s health and welfare,” the website added. &nbsp;</p>
