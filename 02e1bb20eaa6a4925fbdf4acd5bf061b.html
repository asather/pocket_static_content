<h1>'We're only getting started': How the Riverhounds and their league have joined the fight for racial justice</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This season, at USL Championship stadiums throughout the country, a fluid game of constant motion comes to an abrupt halt as the clock hits the seven-minute mark.</p>
<p>At that time, players from across the field have gathered around the center circle and kneel together. They remain there until the clock hits eight minutes and 46 seconds, at which point they rise and the match resumes. The numbers are symbolic —- seven for the number of times Jacob Blake was shot in the back by Kenosha, Wis., police in late August and 8:46 for the amount of time a Minneapolis police officer knelt on the neck of George Floyd in late May.</p>
<p>As more prominent leagues&nbsp;have made headlines for their players taking public stands against racial injustice and police brutality — some going as far as refusing to play -—the USL Championship has seen many of its teams, including Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC, do the same. Most notably, there have been the stoppages at seven minutes with the emblematic endpoint that a number of teams have employed. As the national anthem has played at various venues, many players and even officials have knelt. Two teams, Memphis 901 FC and Forward Madison FC, postponed games after video of the shooting of Blake surfaced.</p>
<p>“When you do it in the middle of a game, people are watching,” Riverhounds defender Ryan James said. “They see it. They see it across the league. All the teams are doing it. I hope it’s starting a conversation and putting out an idea.”</p>
<p>Those efforts were spurred in large part by the league’s Black Players Alliance (BPA), which was formed in late August and aims to “amplify the voices of every Black player both on and off the field and provide the resources necessary to address systemic issues in our sport and our communities.”</p>
<p>While the BPA’s emergence and impact may have seemed sudden, its creation was a months-long process, going back to the immediate aftermath of Floyd’s death. With USL Championship teams sidelined until mid-July due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Black players watched the video of Floyd and the mass demonstrations motivated by it. They began communicating with one another, expressing their anger and dismay while wondering what they could do in the meantime and once play returned. What developed was a chain, with one player reaching out to others he knew at other clubs, those recipients following suit and so on.</p>
<p>“One guy took a first step and reached out, grabbed a hand and then that guy reached out and grabbed someone else,” James said. “Before we knew it, we had a larger network than we thought we would.”</p>
<p>For many Black players, in Pittsburgh and beyond, the cause for which they’re fighting isn’t distant or theoretical. It’s deeply personal.</p>
<p>“Even though I grew up in Canada, I’ve definitely experienced issues,” Riverhounds defender Skylar Thomas said. “It’s obviously not as significant as the ones we’re seeing on national television, but there’s definitely racism in Canada, as well, and I would say that a large majority of the Black population has experienced it and seen it and are ultimately fed up with it.”</p>
<p>Though still in its infancy, the BPA does have goals it hopes to see fulfilled, a number of which pertain to the United Soccer League itself. Players aim to have a continuous dialogue with the league and its teams to foster a more diverse environment, be it on the sidelines or in the front offices. At the USL Championship level, where more than 30% of players are Black, just 13% of coaches are, which includes just three head coaches of 35 clubs (8.6%).</p>
<p>That’s something players hope to see change.</p>
<p>“As Black players in the league who have ambition to be a coach in the league, it’s very difficult to climb that ladder when the majority of what you see doesn’t look like you,” Thomas said.</p>
<p>The potential blowback that some leagues and individual franchises may fear from fans hasn’t materialized, according to USL vice president of communications &amp; public relations Ryan Madden, who said feedback from consumers has been “overwhelmingly positive.” Perhaps it’s not surprising that a soccer league hasn’t drawn that kind of ire from those who follow it over issues of racial activism. According to a FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll from May, 63.9% of self-described major or casual soccer fans are Democrats, compared to 36.1% who are Republicans. A CBS News poll in late July found that 88% of Democrats believe kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial discrimination is acceptable while only 23% of Republicans did.</p>
<p>Beyond the fans, Black players such as James and Thomas said they’ve felt a sense of solidarity from their white teammates and coaches on a team in which 11 of 24 players on the roster are Black.</p>
<p>“We want to support those things,” Riverhounds coach Bob Lilley, who is white, said. “We have some really bright guys and some really mature guys who realize it’s a lot more than just the games. We’re all fighting for it at this point. We need to keep the conversation going and it needs to be there until there’s the appropriate changes and we see progress. It’s not something that you just talk about for a little bit until it goes away. This is something we have to keep in the front of everybody. We have the ability to do that.”</p>
<p>The USL itself has offered support and has communicated with the BPA, but there’s a balance it has to strike. The league has launched initiatives such as its “United Against Racism” campaign, and it has worked in conjunction with the BPA and the USL Players Association, but it wants to provide help without co-opting the players’ actions and overall message.</p>
<p>“Here’s the truth — if we try to impose what we as a league office think activism should look like across 47 communities nationwide, I just don’t think we’re going to get that right,” Madden said. “It’s really important that these things are led by those who are most affected. In this case, that is, without a doubt, the Black Players Alliance.”</p>
<p>How long the moments of unity and other in-game acts continue is unclear. Movements, unlike the games these athletes play, don’t come with a clock with a predetermined end.</p>
<p>For those involved with it, the BPA and what it seeks isn’t some fleeting fancy. It may not always take the form of kneeling at midfield, but its work and mission have the potential to help shape the level of the sport they play. They have a platform, and they intend on using it.</p>
<p>“We’re only getting started,” Thomas said. “For years to come, as long as we have a backing of guys that believe in the values the group brings, I think it’s going to be very powerful.”</p>
