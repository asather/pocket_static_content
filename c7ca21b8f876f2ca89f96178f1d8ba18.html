<h1>Paul Zeise: Can Pitt football ever reach the heights of the 1970s again?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The glowing tributes about Johnny Majors’ career and life have been fitting. Majors, who died Wednesday at age 85, was a tremendous person, a true gentleman and also one hell of a football coach.</p>
<p>He took over an awful Pitt program after the 1972 season and by 1976 had built a national championship team. After his exit, they remained remain among college football’s elite class for about seven more seasons.</p>
<p>That national title is Pitt’s most recent and its only one of college football’s modern area.&nbsp;College football is much different now than it was in the 1970s, and the system isn’t set up very well for a team like Pitt to rise up and win the national championship. That begs the question:</p>
<p>When will the next one come?</p>
<p>Football is increasingly becoming the sport of the elite programs and then everyone else. How do I know this? Look at the past six College Football Playoffs. Not many teams have gotten there.</p>
<p>Pitt isn’t among the elite in college football. It has the potential to be a really good program, a perennial top 25 team and a program that every few years spikes and gets into the top 10. That isn’t likely sustainable, though, because of how college football is funded. The haves are teams that have the resources to pay coaches and keep up with the other elites in the arms race that is the sport.</p>
<p>That’s why it is going to be very tough for Pitt — and about 105 of the other 120 Football Bowl Subdivision schools — to win a national championship. I’d say even Penn State, which has seemingly unlimited resources and has recruited at an elite level for the last few seasons, will face a real challenge to do so.</p>
<p>Pitt would likely have to go undefeated, for starters, to have a chance to play in the playoff. Teams like the Panthers won’t get the benefit of the doubt if they lose like Alabama, Clemson and Ohio State will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, after winning every game during the regular season, the Panthers would have to win the ACC championship. After that, Pitt would have to win two more games against teams who are at the elite level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is a much, much different path to the national championship than the one the Panthers had in the 1970s and ’80s when they were major independents, could control their schedule and also had more say in what bowl they’d go to and who they would play.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say there won’t be a Cinderella story here or there that comes out of nowhere and wins it all, but I think those stories will be extremely rare.&nbsp;Playoff expansion would open the door a little more, but even that is still is longshot until the way college football programs are funded is made more equitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Majors did was special, and it was one of the greatest rebuilding jobs in the history of sports. Pitt fans can cherish that memory forever, but I fear a repeat of that feat any time soon is going to be darn near impossible.</p>
