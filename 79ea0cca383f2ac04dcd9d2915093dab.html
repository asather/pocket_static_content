<h1>Pirates honor Roberto Clemente but come up short on baseball end</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The buildup to Wednesday’s game could not have been better.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence for Vera Clemente and a first pitch all the way from Puerto Rico. Flanked by owner Bob Nutting, Josh Bell was recognized as the Pirates’ Roberto Clemente Award winner. As both teams lined up along the baselines, the omnipresence of Roberto Clemente's No. 21 was a neat visual, the same for the gigantic “21” that was etched into the right-field grass.</p>
<p>The Pirates made a statement. They stirred emotions. They honored a legend and likely took an important first step when it comes to better recognizing a player who’s often vastly underappreciated around Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Pirates, the actual baseball did not match the magic of everything else, as they dropped an 8-1 decision to the Chicago White Sox at PNC Park, Roberto Clemente Day spoiled by one of the club's flatter performances of the season.</p>
<p>“[Wednesday] was a special day for the Pirates, for baseball and for the Clemente family," manager Derek Shelton said. "I don’t think that had any effect on the game. We just didn’t play very well."</p>
<p>For a team that has been reasonably competitive of late, this was not that. The Pirates (14-27) came into Wednesday’s game having won 10 of 20, but the seven-run deficit was one shy of matching their most lopsided loss of the season.</p>
<p>It was a rough start for JT Brubaker and a slow night for the offense, which struggled against White Sox starter Dane Dunning.</p>
<p>Brubaker allowed seven runs over 5 1/3 innings, but the two most noteworthy events were homers, both by catcher James McCann.</p>
<p>The first came on a curveball low and away, a fairly decent offering, but the second one — a middle-middle slider — was definitely not. McCann crushed that one 423 feet to end Brubaker’s night.</p>
<p>“They hit mistake pitches,” Brubaker said. “I had a couple more this game than usual. Just something that, moving forward, working on still being in the zone, just making sure I’m down a little bit more.”</p>
<p>The backbreaker came during a four-run fourth, when second baseman Nick Madrigal’s two-out, two-strike, two-run single made it a 5-0 game.</p>
<p>Shelton made an interesting decision on his handling of Brubaker, something that bucks a recent trend with how he’s treated his starting pitchers: The Pirates manager let Brubaker pitch deeper into the game.</p>
<p>Turns out Shelton might’ve been a little too enthused by Brubaker’s 1-2-3 fifth, when his breaking stuff sharpened up, but McCann’s second homer ended Brubaker’s night at 98 pitches. He started the sixth at 87.</p>
<p>The issue for Brubaker in this one — getting his breaking stuff whacked — was new. Entering Wednesday, opponents were slugging .219 against his slider and just .071 against his curveball. Meanwhile, Brubaker has been throwing those two pitches 48.1% of the time.</p>
<p>“They’re going to punish you if you miss with your breaking balls,” Shelton said. “They did that [Wednesday].”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pirates offense was extremely quiet. Adam Frazier opened with a single to extend his hitting streak to 12 games, but they didn’t get a runner to second base until the fifth, when Josh Bell led off with a single.</p>
<p>The White Sox have delivered some stellar starting pitching performances against the Pirates this season, and this one was no different. Dunning went six scoreless, allowing three hits and a walk with three strikeouts.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ only run came via catcher’s interference in the eighth, and the loss underscored the need to get something going soon for their primary bats. More than two-thirds of the way through, Bryan Reynolds (.181) and Gregory Polanco (.150) are hitting below .200. Kevin Newman is at .240, and Bell is at .209.</p>
<p>“We definitely need to [get going offensively],” Shelton said. “We need to have teaching points. We need to take steps forward. And we need to use these 19 games to get better, so I think that’s very important.”</p>
<p>The loss for the Pirates obviously doesn’t matter a ton in the grand scheme of things. They’re out of the playoffs, and this didn’t change that.</p>
<p>But it had to be disappointing that they couldn’t get the baseball end of things to cooperate on what ultimately turned out to be a magical night honoring a Pittsburgh and MLB icon.</p>
<p>“I think we 100% made a statement,” Shelton said. “The fact of being able to honor Clemente, seeing all the 21s out there and being able to make a statement not only in Pittsburgh but in Puerto Rico and for baseball … this was a monumental step for our organization.</p>
<p>“I think we took a really big step forward. It was something very cool to be part of. Obviously the game didn’t end up the way we wanted, but I thought tonight was a fun-filled night.”</p>
