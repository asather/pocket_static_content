<h1>Nearly all WPIAL schools are planning to participate in fall sports</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just about every high school in the WPIAL is planning to participate in all fall sports.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette high school sports staff reached out to&nbsp;all 117 football-playing schools in the WPIAL this week, and only two schools —&nbsp;Uniontown and Summit Academy, which announced their decisions earlier this month — have decided not to participate in fall sports. The PIAA decided last Friday to go ahead with fall sports in Pennsylvania, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, but voted that every individual school would have to decide whether to participate.</p>
<p>The Post-Gazette contacted either the athletic director or football coach at WPIAL schools and asked about their school’s choice on participating. As of Wednesday evening, a total of 110 schools have decided to play all fall sports. Five schools are proceeding as if they will play, conducting practices this week, but will make final decisions in the next few days. They are Freeport, Quaker Valley, Woodland Hills, Shady Side Academy and Southmoreland.</p>
<p>Uniontown will not play football or boys and girls soccer but plans to play girls volleyball and boys and girls cross country. Summit Academy sponsors only football and boys golf teams in the fall.</p>
<p>While 110 schools have decided to play, a few athletic directors said there is always a chance their school could change its mind. Also, Lincoln Park, a charter school in Midland, voted Tuesday night to suspend fall sports until the school resumes with in-person classes Sept. 21. But athletic director Mike Bariski said the school board will meet Monday to reconsider its decision.</p>
<p>Lincoln Park does not have a football team but has students playing for Western Beaver under a cooperative sponsorship. The football players are not affected by Lincoln Park’s decision. Lincoln Park sponsors girls volleyball, boys and girls golf and boys and girls cross country in the fall.</p>
<p>The WPIAL board of directors had a meeting Monday and voted to give schools until Sept. 1 to inform the league if they do not wish to participate in any fall sports.</p>
