<h1>Jim Rutherford talks 'pretty small market' ahead of NHL trade deadline</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>TAMPA, Fla. — Jim Rutherford generally prefers to get his shopping done early.</p>
<p>Look no further than a year ago, when the Penguins general manager had already executed his most significant pre-deadline deal, trading Derick Brassard and Riley Sheahan to the Florida Panthers for Nick Bjugstad and Jared McCann.</p>
<p>By doing that, Rutherford got the jump on his NHL peers and gave the two new guys three more weeks to get acclimated to the Penguins and Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Feb. 24 deadline, Rutherford has found the trade market to be less hopping, largely because 23 of the league’s 31 teams entering Wednesday were either in playoff position or within eight points of the second wild-card team in their conference.</p>
<p>“I think the market will open up at some point in the next week or two,” the GM said Wednesday afternoon. “Once teams decide which direction they want to go, more players will get into the market. But now it’s a pretty small market.”</p>
<p>Rutherford, with Jake Guentzel’s shoulder in a sling and the winger not expected to be back until late April at the earliest, would like to add a top-six winger to the mix. But he’s in no rush, not with the way this team has been playing.</p>
<p>“You prefer [to get a trade completed sooner than later],” Rutherford said. “But only if you’re comfortable with it. At this point, there hasn’t been any comfort level. And there hasn’t been any urgency. If we don’t add anybody other than the injured players — and Jake, of course — it would be a pretty solid lineup.”</p>
<p>They will have a strong group of six defensemen once Brian Dumoulin returns to the lineup. And they have two good, young goalies and plan to use both down the stretch. So if Rutherford makes a significant move, it will likely be up front.</p>
<p>Rutherford remains focused on adding another forward to the Penguins roster, whether that is a top-line scorer or someone who slots into their bottom six.</p>
<p>He added that he has no concerns about a trade affecting team chemistry.</p>
<p>“Our chemistry is so strong that it doesn’t affect anything,” he said. “We’re not looking at changing a whole lot of players. … But even if we did bring four or five new players, I don’t think it could affect the chemistry of this team.”</p>
<p><strong>No worries about Dumoulin</strong></p>
<p>Dumoulin has been sidelined since Nov. 30 due to an ankle injury that required surgery. After Dumoulin had surgery the following day, the Penguins stated that he would be out at least two months. That mark passed last week. Dumoulin, as of late last week, was still in the off-ice portion of his rehab process.</p>
<p>Rutherford said he has no worries about Dumoulin and whether the top-pairing defenseman will be as effective whenever he returns from a long layoff.</p>
<p>“We’re pretty comfortable that he’s going to be OK,” he said of Dumoulin, who still leads the Penguins with a plus-17 rating. “He’s just one of those guys that is a smart player. And it won’t take him long to get going. The key is for him to be 100% healthy. But as long as that’s the case, he’ll fit in pretty nicely.”</p>
<p><strong>Rust returns to practice</strong></p>
<p>Bryan Rust, who leads the Penguins with 22 goals, missed Monday’s practice in Tampa after he briefly skated with head athletic trainer Chris Stewart looking on. Coach Mike Sullivan said Monday it was merely a “maintenance day.”</p>
<p>The speedy winger practiced in full with the team Wednesday at Amalie Arena, where the Penguins will play the talented Tampa Bay Lightning on Thursday. He was back on Evgeni Malkin’s left wing, with Patric Hornqvist on the right.</p>
