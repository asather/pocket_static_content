<h1>Wilkinsburg officer who shot Romir Talley made initial complaint about mural, document reveals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Wilkinsburg police officer who shot and killed a man last December was recently discovered to be the same officer who initially notified other officers about a mural being painted to honor the man who died.</p>
<p>Wilkinsburg police have charged three people with criminal mischief and criminal conspiracy for painting a mural in July of 24-year-old Romir Talley.</p>
<p>In a criminal complaint filed against one of the mural’s artists, Wilkinsburg police Officer Robert Gowans — who was identified in August as the officer who shot and killed Mr. Talley — was ID’d as the officer who initially tipped other officers to the mural.</p>
<p>Wilkinsburg Officer John Snyder wrote the complaint, stating Officer Gowans notified a sergeant July 11 that a mural was being painted for Mr. Talley at Penn and Center. When the sergeant responded to the area, he said he noticed three people had painted a mural on the side of a commercial building at 771 Penn Ave., according to the complaint.</p>
<p>The mural has since been painted over. Police say the cost to remove the graffiti was $7,200, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Despite painting over the mural, protesters have continued to visit the site of where the mural once stood to call attention to its erasure. Since his death, Mr. Talley’s family and protesters have continued to call for more transparency between Wilkinsburg police, and they dispute the details of the police account of the night he was killed.</p>
<p>Last Saturday — as part of the “Civil Saturdays” — several hundred people marched from Bakery Square to the site of the former&nbsp;Wilkinsburg mural, where they called for District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. to formally charge Officer Gowans. They were then addressed by Latasha Talley, Mr. Talley’s mother.</p>
<p>“I can’t sleep. It’s hard to eat. My son was my rock, and now he’s gone,” she tearfully said to the crowd. “And they tried to erase my son like it was nothing. That was my baby. He was a strong Black man.”</p>
