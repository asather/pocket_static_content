<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: If you're the Steelers GM, who do you take in Round 2?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Zach:</strong>&nbsp;If you were Kevin Colbert, who would you draft with the Steelers’ first pick in the second round of this year’s draft?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Wow, that’s a lot of power to give me. That is a really difficult because I don’t know who will be picked before the Steelers select. They don’t even get to pick the first night. The big thing is this — who is the best player on the board? That’s the position the Steelers are in right now. They have the luxury of going in a few different directions. They can take the best player on the board from running back, wide receiver, offensive line and even linebacker. The highest rated player on their board from one of those positions is whom they should draft.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jon B:</strong> Why are you so against the idea of the Steelers drafting a quarterback? Mason Rudolph is just not good enough, why is this so hard for you to see?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I am against the Steelers wasting a pick on a player who can’t help them win this year. They have an aging quarterback with only so many years left. They need to be in&nbsp;“win this year” mode, and that means getting players who can help them win. There isn’t a quarterback on the board still at No. 49 who will be better than Rudolph this year. Rudolph has been in the system for two years already and has game experience. And the rookie won’t have the benefit of OTAs and minicamp to get up to speed, and there might even be a shortened training camp.The Steelers will need to address quarterback at some point, just not now.</p>
<p><strong>Tyler K:</strong> What kind of receiver do you think the Steelers need in this draft?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Preferably one that catches the ball. I think given the hiring of Matt Canada, the Steelers should try and grab one of those super athletic and quick receivers who makes a lot of plays in space with the ball. Those are the kind of players that are perfect for the jet sweeps and reverses that Canada has often incorporated into his offense. There are a few of those kinds of receivers who will be available.</p>
<p><strong>Joe L:</strong> How many players do you think will be drafted from Pitt? This doesn’t seem to be a great senior class in terms of NFL prospects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> There are probably only two who have a chance. Cornerback Dane Jackson will almost assuredly be drafted. He is a big, strong, physical corner with great ball skills. The other player who probably has a shot is linebacker Kylan Johnson. There are a few others who will be undrafted free agents. Next year’s graduating class should be a lot stronger.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brad:</strong> The president had a phone call with the leaders of sports industry groups along with commissioners of the leagues and owners. What do you think will come out of that? Do you think he gave them his blessing to get back to work and start playing games?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I have no idea. I don’t know what they talked about. There isn’t going to be any movement toward playing games until the health officials and experts on infectious diseases say it is safe. Until then, this is all basically window dressing.</p>
<p><strong>Chad:</strong>&nbsp;What is the best non-major league sporting event you have ever attended?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong>&nbsp;I was at an Arena Football League championship. That was pretty cool to see. I would also say there were a few really exciting Pittsburgh Spirit indoor soccer games as well as the Pittsburgh Crossefire indoor lacrosse games.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff:&nbsp;</strong>Where do you think QB Jameis Winston will end up signing? Do you think he will take a back-up role with a team?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> It will be interesting to see where he lands. This is a better question for next week after the draft. His camp has said they will wait until after the draft to see what the best situation is for him to compete for a starting job. I don’t think he will sign anywhere as the certain starter, but he will sign somewhere he has a chance to compete for it.</p>
