<h1>Penguins players, staff calling season ticket holders</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penguins fans don't know exactly when they'll be able to see their favorite players again. But some just might hear from them.</p>
<p>Starting on Wednesday morning, general manager Jim Rutherford, coach Mike Sullivan and his staff and all of the players began making personal phone calls to select season ticket holders and corporate sponsors. Each individual will be dialing about 15 to 20 of the fans who typically pack PPG Paints Arena, with the goal of reaching around 400 to 500 people.</p>
<p>Tom McMillan, the Penguins vice president of communications, said the goal is to brighten some spirits and stay in contact with the fans. The calls started at 9 a.m. on Wednesday and will continue for three days.</p>
<p>Penguins fans are among the most passionate in the NHL with a 600-plus game sellout streak that dates back to 2007. Earlier this season, Forbes named Penguins fans No. 1 in the NHL for the third time since 2009. The study based the ranking on local television ratings, attendance, secondary market ticket demand, merchandise, social media reach and percentage of a given team’s market that watched, attended or listened to a game in the past year.</p>
<p>Only time will tell when those fans might get to see a game again — especially live. The Penguins (40-23-6) were sitting in third place in the Metropolitan Division standings when the NHL season was suspended on March 10 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, the NHL extended the self-quarantine guidelines through the end of April, a deadline that might be pushed back further.</p>
<p>As of now, there are no concrete plans about when or how the NHL might resume its season.</p>
