<h1>Colleges, legislators look at issue of access to menstrual products</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Clarion University has bypassed coin slots on pad and tampon dispensers in academic building restrooms across its main and Venango campuses, in what advocates describe as a simple act of fairness that will help women stay focused on their studies.</p>
<p>“It’s an equity issue. Period,” read an announcement posted to the university’s website.</p>
<p>The change comes amid a growing national discussion about availability of those products in public restrooms and whether, as hygiene products, they should be free as is toilet tissue and soap. A fall survey by the State System of Higher Education, of which Clarion is a member, found various initiatives on its other campuses to offer free products, including those donated, to women in at least some restrooms or designated central locations.</p>
<p>Nationally, the issue touches on health safety and hygiene and on what activists call “period poverty,” or the difficulty in paying for the products, especially among the poor. And, even among those who can afford it, the use of many restroom machines requiring exact change in an era of debit cards and Venmo can leave students stranded.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, legislation that would make menstrual products available in public settings at no charge is pending in both the Senate and the House.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 956, dubbed the “Menstrual Equity Act,” proposes that agencies serving youth —&nbsp;from school districts and colleges to shelters and corrections facilities —&nbsp;supply the products in restrooms at no cost, as they do toilet paper and other basic hygiene.</p>
<p>House Bill 1708 amending the Public School Code of 1949 would require feminine hygiene products be available in schools that serve students from grades six through 12. The bill, whose prime sponsor is Danielle Friel Otten, D-Chester, specifies sizes and absorbancies.</p>
<p>The Senate bill, whose prime sponsor is Sen. Maria Collett, D-Montgomery, would cover Clarion and 13 other universities within the State System, plus the state-related universities including the University of Pittsburgh, Penn State, Temple and Lincoln universities, and Pennsylvania’s 14 community colleges. It also addresses middle and high schools.</p>
<p>“We should have addressed this a long time ago,” said state Sen. Judith Schwank, D-Berks, a co-sponsor and member of the State System’s board of governors.</p>
<p>But there are concerns. State Rep. Curtis Sonney, R-Erie, chair of the House Education Committee, said that he met with a high school student he believes inspired the House legislation and understands her point. He cited the potential cost of a new requirement for school districts and suggested she approach her district and nearby ones to address the need and gauge their support.</p>
<p>“Anytime that Harrisburg hands down an unfunded mandate, what we hear in return is that property taxes will have to go up to pay for it, and it’s the state’s fault.”</p>
<p>Asked about the House bill’s prospects in a state stressed financially, he said, “Not very likely in the immediate future.”</p>
<p>Sen. Michele Brooks, R-Mercer, chair of the Senate’s Health and Human Services Committee, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The program at Clarion began with Kaitlyn Krupa, 21, a nursing major who never understood what she views as a double standard. She says she researched and developed a proposal that the student government, Clarion’s Presidential Commission on the Status of Women and the school’s Center for Wellness all embraced.</p>
<p>A junior from Drifting, Clearfield County, Ms. Krupa said the topic is relevant both personally and to her career aspirations in health care. “If you would walk into a bathroom, you would just expect to find toilet paper and soap,” she said. “It’s the same reason why tampons and menstrual products should be available.”</p>
<p>Women pay hundreds of dollars a year for those products, but Ms. Krupa said her goal simply is to make them available for women who are out on campus with an immediate need. She hopes most or all of the cost, at least initially, can be covered by donations.</p>
<p>Clarion’s 4,700-member student body is 70% female, and across the State System, women account for nearly six in 10 students.</p>
<p>A survey by the Amercian Civil Liberties Union and the group, Period Equity, finds fewer than 20 states have laws providing free access to feminine hygiene products in either schools, shelters or corrections facilities.</p>
<p>Officials at Clarion say it can disadvantage women in pursuing an education. The fear of having to rush across campus with soiled clothing is, at minimum, a distraction. Worse, it leads women to sometimes miss part or all of their classroom day, they said.</p>
<p>“Emptying one’s bladder and bowels are normal bodily functions, and we see fit to provide [for] those functions by supplying restrooms with toilet paper,” said Kathleen Welsch, Clarion English professor who also teaches women and gender studies courses. “Washing hands afterward is considered an essential health habit, so soap and paper towels are supplied.”</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Pitt has begun making available free menstrual products in multiple women’s bathrooms, a university spokesman said. Carnegie Mellon University, though not a public institution, says the products are offered free in some of its campus buildings.</p>
<p>On Penn State’s main campus, they are available in the Hetzel Union Building and elsewhere through an undergraduate student association effort aided by an outside non-profit group — an effort that could expand to University Libraries and possibly to other Penn State campuses with university support.</p>
<p>Nearly 96,000 students attend the 14 member campuses of the State System, which include California, Edinboro, Indiana and Slippery Rock as well as Clarion in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In the fall, eight of the system campuses including Clarion responded to the survey on availability of products on their campuses.&nbsp;Cal U, for instance, said some products are available without charge that are received as free samples from companies. Edinboro reported that it had a free vending machine in the university’s health center, and that products also were available without charge in the health center’s self care room.</p>
<p>Judith Shapira, State System board chair and Daniel Greenstein, system chancellor, were not available to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Instead, State System spokesman David Pidgeon issued the following statement:</p>
<p>“While the choice about providing menstrual products on campus is a university decision, we expect State System schools to thoroughly examine the question, encourage honest and open conversations within their campus communities, and make a choice that prioritizes students above all.”</p>
