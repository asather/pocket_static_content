<p><strong>Turning point:</strong> After dropping Game 1, the Penguins needed to come out with a spark. Sidney Crosby provided it. Off a beautiful feed from Guentzel, Crosby went five-hole on Carey Price. This could turn out to be the turning point in the entire series.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Stick taps</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chirps</strong></p>
<p><strong>They said it:</strong></p>
<p>“For me that’s what Matt [Murray] does this time of year. He makes big saves at key times that help us win games.” — Mike Sullivan.</p>
<p>“It’s not about getting shutouts this time of year,&nbsp;or really ever. It’s about winning games.” — Matt Murray</p>
<p>“Being a summer birthday, there wasn’t a lot of hockey going on at that time. … Without looking too far ahead, it’s a unique thing.” — Crosby, No. 87, on Game 4 falling on his birthday, 8/7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It shows that he had a lot of confidence in this lineup and a lot of confidence in the players.” — John Marino on Sullivan’s decision to trust the process and believe the result would be different without any significant lineup changes.&nbsp;</p>
