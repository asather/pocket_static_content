<h1>Review: Police drummer Stewart Copeland offers a fresh take on hell in rock opera</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The stylish Roxian Theater in McKees Rocks reopened with much fanfare in 2019 and has hosted a variety of rock, indie, bluegrass, folk, dubstep and more. Friday night saw a new sort of act for the remodeled venue — the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh.&nbsp;What’s a bunch of strait-laced choir folk doing in such a hip venue, you might ask?</p>
<p>Well, where would you book “Satan’s Fall,” a rock opera by Stewart Copeland, The Police drummer?</p>
<p>Copeland, who has a growing list of composing credits to his name, wrote his take on Milton’s “Paradise Lost” for choir, soloists and orchestra.&nbsp;Choirs and rock halls go together like gargoyles on old cathedrals. There’s something inherently Gothic about a full adult choir illuminated by whirling red spotlights, especially when the choir opens with “Media Vita,” a Gregorian-flavored, chant-like work for low male voices punctuated by tribal drumming.</p>
<p>Mr. Copeland himself took to the stage Friday night to&nbsp;demonstrate the unamplified&nbsp;power of the Mendelssohn Choir, enthusiastically conducting singers in the famous&nbsp;“O Fortuna” from&nbsp;“Carmina Burana (think “Lord of the Rings” soundtrack music on steroids).</p>
<p>He kicked over a couple of music stands to cement his standing as the most inspired emcee of a Pittsburgh classical ensemble. The he ceded&nbsp;the stage to the choir’s music director, Matthew Mehaffey, who launched the ensemble into the world premiere of “Satan’s Fall,” a choral work whose text is adapted from “Paradise Lost.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The performance was high-energy but low-yield.&nbsp;Though the instruments and vocal soloists were mic’ed up, the sound was so loud and muddled it was almost impossible to understand what the singers were saying. In another venue, supertitles might have helped listeners stay connected with the plot, but here it was impossible to keep track.</p>
<p>Brass instruments consistently overpowered the ensemble. Soloists sounded tinny and loud yet indistinct. God (bass Hayden Keefer) and the Messiah (soprano Stephanie Sue Curtice) fared best, while Satan (bass Scott O’Neal) and narrators Raphael (tenor Nathan Granner) and Raphaella (a new character voiced by soprano Jamie Chamberlin) lost their battles with overly thick orchestrations.</p>
<p>Technical issues aside, the music itself relied on soloists heavily and didn’t utilize the choir well in terms of balance. Often the chorus simply provided harmony and emphasized whatever the soloists were singing. Still, they did this well. There were driving rhythmic grooves throughout and few pauses or breaks. Individual lines for the instruments didn’t seem idiomatic (again, block chords in the brass consistently blared) and there was little variation in volume or texture throughout the composition. It was difficult to tell whether blame lies with the piece or the amplification on Friday.</p>
<p>Singers and musicians delivered the piece with spirit and skill but couldn’t overcome the problems inherent in the sound system and score. Still, full credit to the Mendelssohn Choir for its continued creativity in programming. This concert may have been a whiff, but what a swing! A second performance on Saturday (ticket information is <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/night-2-satans-fall-composed-by-stewart-copeland-tickets-71663029049" target="_blank">here</a>) offers a chance at redemption.</p>

<p>Also disappointing was the Feb. 3 Chamber Music Pittsburgh concert, which featured the Gryphon Trio and Nordic Voices in concert in Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland. Nordic Voices, a six-voice <em>a capella</em> ensemble that runs the gamut from early music to contemporary, was consistently treble heavy and even out of tune at times in music by a pair of 16th-century composers, while the Gryphon Trio didn’t demonstrate much dynamic range in Beethoven’s Trio in B-flat major, the&nbsp;“Archduke,” causing the performance to feel a bit wooden.</p>
<p>In the second half of the concert the ensembles joined together to perform Canadian composer Jeffrey Ryan’s&nbsp;“Scar Tissue,” composed specially for these nine players. Before the piece began, Mr. Ryan explained that the music was meant to evoke the biological process by which scar tissue is created, the stages of unity, disruption and then healing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were some wonderful moments, admirably played, but as a whole, a consistent lack of precision in either rhythm or pitch proved distracting. The music itself meandered, fronting various incongruous textures and gestures that seemed more subservient to the text, poetry by Michael Redhill “and others.” Rather than transformative, the work felt like individual movements grafted into an ungainly whole.</p>
