<h1>Pirates' projected playoff odds take a hit if leagues are split by spring training sites</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates are forecast to be among the losers if one of the leading proposals to salvage baseball’s 2020 season amid the coronavirus pandemic moves forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/projecting-the-cactus-grapefruit-league-standings/" target="_blank">Dan Szymborski of Fangraphs</a> on Monday released his popular ZiPS projections for a shortened campaign played at spring training sites in Florida and Arizona, and the local team loses ground compared to expectations within the traditional league structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the Pirates’ original odds were not very good to begin with. ZiPS had them with just a 3.3% chance to qualify for the postseason out of their long-time home in the National League’s Central division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in an open Grapefruit League format, those odds are roughly halved to 1.7% with a projection that the club would finish 12th in the 15-team field. Not great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prospects improve in divisions set by Floridian geography, but not by much. In projections <a href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/projecting-the-cactus-grapefruit-league-standings-part-2-lets-divisionate/#more-338183" target="_blank">released Wednesday</a>, ZiPS gives the Pirates a 2.4% chance of making the playoffs when grouped with the New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies, Toronto Blue Jays and Detroit Tigers, all of whom hold their camps close to the Pirates’ spring training home in Bradenton, Fla.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Yankees would be the overwhelming favorite in the group, with an 88.9% chance to win the division.</p>
<p>The latter format was the subject of a report by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2020/04/10/mlb-realignment-league-considers-radical-move-for-2020-season/5128935002/" target="_blank">USA Today’s Bob Nightengale</a> last week and seems the likeliest to be implemented if there is going to be a 2020 season. But just for fun,&nbsp;Szymborski also released projections within some alternative division splits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first set of splits is built to preserve traditional rivalries and national geography, and the Pirates perform worst in that one. When grouped with the Phillies, Houston Astros, Minnesota Twins and St. Louis Cardinals, their odds drop to 1.4%.</p>
<p>The second proposal mimics the European club soccer model of upper and lower divisions based on roster strength as projected by ZiPS. Unsurprisingly, the Pirates end up in the lower division, but that’s great for their odds, which skyrocket to 29.2% when grouped with the Blue Jays, Tigers, Miami Marlins and Baltimore Orioles. The latter three teams all lost 100 games or more in 2019, so it makes sense that the Pirates’ odds would improve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t get your hopes up for that format, though. For logistical reasons, the structure reported by Nightengale makes the most sense. It would find the Pirates in the same division as one of the richest and most loaded teams in baseball, making the playoffs a true uphill climb.</p>
<p>That dynamic would be quite different from last season, when even a weak Pirates team was able to stay in the division race for much of the season because of its lack of a truly dominant team.&nbsp;</p>
