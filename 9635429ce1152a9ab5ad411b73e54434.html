<h1>Antonio Brown hints at early retirement from NFL ... again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was almost exactly a year ago that former Steelers receiver Antonio Brown, then a member of the Oakland Raiders, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/08/09/Antonio-Brown-threatens-retirement-helmet-NFL-restrictions-Raiders-Steelers-feet/stories/201908090115" target="_blank">threatened to retire</a> from professional football if he wasn’t allowed to wear the kind of helmet in which he felt most comfortable.</p>
<p>Now, after a tumultuous year that ended with Brown out of the NFL by late September, he has indicated again via a series of tweets his intention to retire from the NFL because “at this point the risk is greater than the reward.”</p>
<p>The reaction to this news on social media ranged from some determining where he stands among the best receivers of the last decade to disbelief given the number of times he has previously claimed he was going to hang up his cleats.</p>
<p>The timing of Brown’s apparent retirement is interesting because earlier Monday, ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reported that the Seattle Seahawks <a href="https://twitter.com/JFowlerESPN/status/1285266156195061761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1285266156195061761%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fnfl-rumors-seahawks-done-deep-182728433.html" target="_blank">recently did a “deep dive”</a> on him as a player and person. Seattle might still come calling, and Brown may have to tell coach Pete Carroll that his football days have come to an end.</p>
<p>Brown had a tumultuous few months in summer 2019 that included the Steelers trading him to the Raiders, the Raiders releasing him and the New England Patriots signing him in rapid succession. Brown only played one game as a Patriot before being released soon after he was <a href="http://liber.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/09/10/antonio-brown-sexual-assault-allegations-patriots/stories/201909100156" target="_blank">accused in a federal lawsuit</a> of raping his former trainer.</p>
<p>A few days after the Patriots let him go, <a href="https://twitter.com/AB84/status/1175764155359465478?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1175764155359465478%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.post-gazette.com%2Fsports%2Fsteelers%2F2019%2F09%2F22%2Fantonio-brown-retirement-news-twitter-nfl-patriots%2Fstories%2F201909220169" target="_blank">Brown tweeted</a> that he “will not be playing in the NFL anymore,” which sounded like a retirement announcement. He <a href="https://twitter.com/AB84/status/1177250920893206533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1177250920893206533%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2019%2F09%2F26%2Fsports%2Fantonio-brown-nfl-retire.html" target="_blank">took that assertion back</a> four days later in another tweet that simply read, “I’m still the best why stop now.”</p>
<p>His road back to the NFL took a hit in January when his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/16/antonio-brown-drew-rosenhaus-logan-paul-fight-youtube/stories/202001160154" target="_blank">decided to cut ties</a> with his former client. Brown had <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/12/27/antonio-brown-saints-workout-nfl/stories/201912270103" target="_blank">reportedly worked out</a> with the New Orleans Saints a few weeks earlier, though nothing ever came of that.</p>
<p>In February, Brown <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/06/antonio-brown-interview-937-the-fan-juju-smith-schuster-ben-roethlisberger/stories/202002060101" target="_blank">did an interview with 93.7 The Fan</a> where he certainly sounded like an athlete itching to get back to the pinnacle of his sport.</p>
<p>“It’s just a real adversity I have to go through,” he said. “Everyone loves comeback stories, man. I’m in shape. 2020’s going to be a great year. And it’s a great opportunity to bounce back.”</p>
<p>Back in April, a video of Brown training with Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson and receiver Marquise “Hollywood Brown” — his cousin — led to rumors that the Ravens may be looking into signing him. As the Post-Gazette’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2020/05/04/antonio-brown-baltimore-ravens-rumors-pittsburgh-steelers-ron-cook/stories/202005040023" target="_blank">Ron Cook predicted</a>, that notion didn’t pan out, either.</p>
<p>No one knows what the 2020 NFL season will look like given all the precautions that must be taken due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The only thing more uncertain at this point than how games will be played is whether or not Brown will pop up in one of them.</p>
