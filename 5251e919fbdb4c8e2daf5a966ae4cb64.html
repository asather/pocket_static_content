<p>Pittsburgh hardcore/metal band Code Orange announced Friday that it will release its new album, “Undernearth,” on March 13 on Roadrunner Records.</p>
<p>“Underneath,” the follow-up to 2017’s Grammy-nominated breakout “Forever,” is advanced with a typically menacing, industrial-strength title track and video with lead vocals from guitarist Reba Meyers and a growling break from drummer Jami Morgan. It further reveals the unique qualities that made the band formed at Pittsburgh CAPA an international sensation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Morgan said in a statement, “‘ Underneath’ is about facing the duality in ourselves as individuals and as a society in an overcrowded, overexposed, all-consuming digital nirvana. Everyone has a voice and no one’s seems to matter… plummet down the rabbit hole of your deepest fears, anxieties and regrets to confront the monster that has been building underneath. down.we.go”</p>
<p>The album is produced by Morgan and Nick Raskulinecz with co-producer Will Yip, with additional programming from Chris Vrenna, and was mixed by Yip and Code Orange’s Eric ‘Shade’ Balderose.&nbsp;</p>
