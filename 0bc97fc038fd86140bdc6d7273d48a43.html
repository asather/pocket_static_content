<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — As Joe Biden nears the announcement of his vice presidential choice, the top contenders and their advocates are making final appeals.</p>
<p>The campaign hasn’t finalized a date for naming a running mate, but three people who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans said a public announcement likely wouldn’t happen before the week of Aug. 10. That’s one week before Democrats will hold their convention to officially nominate Mr. Biden as their presidential nominee.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden said in May that he hoped to name his pick around Aug. 1 and told reporters this week that he would “have a choice in the first week of August.” He notably stopped short of saying when he would announce that choice.</p>
<p>Running mates are often announced on the eve of a convention. As he prepares to make his choice, a committee established to vet possible running mates has provided Mr. Biden with briefing materials. Mr. Biden will likely soon begin one-on-one conversations with those under consideration, which could be the most consequential part of the process for a presidential candidate who values personal connections.</p>
<p>The leading contenders include California Sen. Kamala Harris, California Rep. Karen Bass and Obama national security adviser Susan Rice. The deliberations remain fluid, however, and the campaign has reviewed nearly a dozen possible running mates.</p>
<p>“For Joe Biden, this is crunch time. After all the vetting, all the investigations into the prospective nominees, it’s now up to Joe. It’s personal,” said former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was vetted for vice president in 2008. “It’s now about his gut feeling.”</p>
<p>Representatives for Mr. Biden declined to comment for this story.</p>
<p>The selection amounts to the most significant choice Mr. Biden has confronted in his nearly five-decade political career. He has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.</p>
<p>Given the historic significance of the moment, some are urging Mr. Biden not to let the announcement linger too long.</p>
<p>“My sense is that the VP himself, having been through this process, is aware of and mindful of not letting people hang out there too long,” said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. “There certainly seems to be a bit of a media frenzy, and I think we have to be aware that at a point, it becomes unfair to the candidates being considered.”</p>
<p>As a decision looms, the camps are jockeying for position.</p>
<p>Ms. Harris’ allies mobilized this week after Politico reported that the co-chair of the vetting committee, former Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, was concerned about Ms. Harris’ tough debate stage performance and that she hasn’t expressed regret.</p>
<p>Several California elected officials and labor leaders initiated a call with the vetting team to emphasize that Ms. Harris has strong support among labor and political leaders in her home state. The call was organized by Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and included the mayors of Oakland, Long Beach and Stockton and former Gov. Gray Davis.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden has sought feedback on his pick from former President Barack Obama, who has provided advice but has insisted the choice is his to make, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations.</p>
<p>Biden allies say his wife, Jill, and sister, Valerie Biden Owens, are likely to play a key role in the decision, as they have with many of Mr. Biden’s biggest political decisions throughout his career.</p>
