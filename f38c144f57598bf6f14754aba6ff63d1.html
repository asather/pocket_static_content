<h1>Star quarterback, center finish at the top of Washington High School's graduating class</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Since ninth grade, Zack Swartz has spent a lot of time behind teammate Gerald Comedy.</p>
<p>Swartz is a quarterback and Comedy a center.</p>
<p>But when Washington High School holds its graduation ceremony Friday, Swartz will finally find himself in front of Comedy.</p>
<p>Swartz is the valedictorian and Comedy the salutatorian.</p>
<p>Star football players finishing 1-2 in their class likely doesn’t happen too often. But Swartz and Comedy have proven to be just as productive in the classroom as they are on the field, and that’s saying something. Both were named all-state last season and Swartz was picked to the Post-Gazette’s Fabulous 22 team. Throw in the fact that the two have been best friends since freshman year, and it makes for a truly unique situation.</p>
<p>“I talked to a lot of people in the school and guys who have been around, and I don’t think anyone can recall something like this happening,” Washington football coach Mike Bosnic said.</p>
<p>So much for the “dumb jocks” stereotype. Swartz and Comedy flattened that like Comedy flattens defensive linemen. Swartz sported a 4.4 GPA. Comedy was no joke, either, boasting a 4.3 GPA.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely that stereotype that jocks aren’t the brightest,” Swartz said. “It’s nice to have two athletes at Wash High finish in the top two.”</p>
<p>Added Comedy: “It’s pretty cool. I don’t think we realized it, but it makes sense because we both put the time in.”</p>
<p>At some point, the two could be known as Dr. Swartz and Dr. Comedy. Swartz will attend West Virginia to study biochemistry and pre-med. He hopes to become a pathologist specializing in cancer research. Comedy is headed to IUP to major in exercise science with a goal of becoming a doctor of physical therapy. Comedy will play football. Swartz will not. He did have an offer from Morehead State but decided to fully concentrate on academics.</p>
<p>Their friendship began four years ago. Swartz had moved from the Laurel Highlands School District before freshman year, and he and Comedy hit it off quickly. They began spending lots of time together in the weight room and working on group projects. Before they knew it, they were best friends, a great development considering Comedy would be snapping the ball to Swartz thousands of times over the next few years.</p>
<p>“They are best of friends,” Bosnic said. “They have a great relationship. To have a QB and center be on the same page and be good friends is great. It was just a pleasure to coach both of those guys.”</p>
<p>Swartz and Comedy, team captains as seniors, helped Washington to a lot of wins in their four seasons, the final three as starters. The Little Prexies went 47-5, won four conference titles, and advanced to the WPIAL Class 2A championship twice, winning the title in 2017 and finishing as the runner-up in 2019.</p>
<p>Swartz is one of only three players in WPIAL history with more than 6,000 career passing yards and 2,000 rushing yards. He accounted for 47 touchdowns his senior season. Comedy was a finalist for the Bill Fralic Memorial Award, given to the WPIAL’s most outstanding lineman. Making that accomplishment all the more impressive was that Comedy tore the labrum in his right shoulder in the final regular-season game, yet still played the final four games of the season. The injury did cost him his senior season in wrestling.</p>
<p>As an offensive lineman, Comedy doesn’t put up big stats — well, other than a healthy amount of pancake blocks — but he’s all about them in the classroom. His favorite subject is AP stats. Swartz’s is biology. He said the advanced biology class he had with teacher Jeff Devenney his freshman year sparked his interest in becoming a pathologist. Comedy’s desire to be a physical therapist stemmed from his experiences getting physical therapy because of injuries.</p>
<p>Excelling in the classroom has always been a big deal for both.</p>
<p>“My parents always said academics first,” Comedy said. “I’ve always tried to help my teammates do the same thing.”</p>
<p>The two share some of the same interests — football, obviously, along with listening to hip hop music. But at the same time, they are very different. Comedy outweighs Swartz by about 100 pounds. Swartz has a more outgoing personality, while Comedy is more reserved. Comedy also has a big advantage when it comes to facial hair — he has a tremendous beard for a high school student.</p>
<p>“I’d say in that category he has me beat,” Swartz said, laughing. “I’m going to have to shave for my speech. I have quarantine-level [facial hair] right now.”</p>
<p>Swartz and Comedy will deliver speeches at Washington’s graduation. Swartz said he would like to begin his speech by telling a joke. Based on his last name, Comedy should do the same.</p>
<p>But when it comes to excellence on the field and classroom, Swartz and Comedy are no joke whatsoever.</p>
<p>“I’m really proud of both of them,” Bosnic said. “As their coach, I’ve known for a long time that we had two really special guys in Zack and Gerald. They were really fun to coach. They were obviously leaders, and highly motivated and highly driven students.”</p>
