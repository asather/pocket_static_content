<h1>Coming up short in North Carolina, Sanders’ Super Tuesday party sees a mixed bag</h1>

<p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The Bernie Sanders faithful gathered over craft brews, food truck grub and DJ spinning a “power to the people” playlist at Tip Top Daily Market, a blink-and-you-miss-it purveyor of beer, wine and vinyl records in North Carolina’s largest city.</p>
<p>But the food truck was barely fired up before the result came in: Former Vice President Joe Biden would win the Tar Heel State, the third-biggest prize on the most crucial election night of the primary season, announced just minutes after polls closed at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The group of supporters, which was still growing when the state was called, groaned in despair. Less than an hour later, the crowd’s spirits were buoyed when Sen. Sanders, I-Vt., won California, took an early lead in Texas and stayed competitive in Maine, Minnesota and Arkansas.</p>
<p>“We needed that,” said John Burton to his wife, Molly Burton, who sported a T-shirt with a 1980s photo of Mr. Sanders with the text, “Rage Against The Machine.”</p>
<p>And so went the night at the market, which swelled with people as the bar’s televisions showed CNN making projections and providing analysis.</p>
<p>Overall, Mr. Sanders’ supporters processed a mixed bag: Mr. Biden racked up delegates early in the night, three days after a win in South Carolina that earned him endorsements from former rivals Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar — yet Mr. Sanders stayed competitive and continued amassing delegates of his own.</p>
<p>The Burtons, who moved to Charlotte from Oklahoma City in December for Mr. Burton’s job as a filmmaker, had been drawn to Mr. Sanders’ 2016 campaign. Mr. Sanders’ messaging on health care struck Mr. Burton, who was at that time an insurance agent selling health plans.</p>
<p>“I have some horrifying experiences,” Mr. Burton said, including clients who passed away because they could not get the treatment they needed.</p>
<p>“Right around that time, in comes Bernie,” he said. “I’ve never heard of him before, and he’s talking about ‘Medicare for All’ — and it was like, yep, that’s a no-brainer.”</p>
<p>While they did not have time to volunteer in 2016, they canvassed in Charlotte leading up to Super Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some at the market traveled from far away. Aaron Tabackman, a tour guide who lives in New York City, took a “Bernie journey” to Charlotte for a few days to help knock on doors and call people to support the candidate.</p>
<p>Mr. Tabackman supported Mr. Sanders’ campaign in 2016 but acknowledged his support “was a little more spontaneous.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders’ 2016 campaign “was very uncharted, and, frankly, I was a little surprised how competitive Bernie was against Hillary,” he said. “The fact that he was competitive got me more involved.”</p>
<p>This year, Mr. Tabackman volunteers with the Sanders campaign in New York. He rode a bus to New Hampshire to help canvass for Mr. Sanders in that state.</p>
<p>“I think Bernie needed to win New Hampshire to be viable,” he said. Mr. Sanders won by a slim margin.</p>
<p>As Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden took a lead in the overall delegate count, Mr. Burton said the consolidated Democratic primary field may wind up helping Mr. Sanders.</p>
<p>“We have yet to turn the giant, withering spotlight on Biden,” Mr. Burton said. “Like the fact he supported cutting Social Security for decades. The fact he voted for the Iraq War. … All of his tough-on-crime stuff, drug war stuff, all of that has yet to surface.”</p>
<p>Later in the night, when the television screens broadcast Mr. Sanders’ speech to supporters in Vermont, that message was clear.</p>
<p>In his “against all odds” presidential campaign, Mr. Sanders said, “we’re taking on the political establishment.”</p>
<p>“Tonight, I tell you with absolute confidence, we’re going to win the Democratic nomination and we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country,” Mr. Sanders declared.</p>
<p>Without naming Mr. Biden, he called out “one candidate” for voting for the Iraq war, for “disastrous trade agreements” and for taking to the Senate floor “calling for cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans’ programs.”</p>
<p>“We’re going to win because the people understand it is our campaign, our movement that is best positioned to beat Trump,” Mr. Sanders said.&nbsp;</p>
