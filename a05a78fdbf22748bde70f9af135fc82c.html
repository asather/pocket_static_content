<h1>Adam Frazier became an everyday player ... and a trade chip for the Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Adam Frazier entered the offseason with plenty to think about. After years of bouncing between a few different positions, he had finally settled on life at second base, blossoming into a Gold Glove finalist. At the plate, Frazier finished strong after starting with a slash line of .254/.311/.361 that dropped him to eighth in the Pirates’ batting order.</p>
<p>But at Major League Baseball’s Winter Meetings, held in early December in San Diego, Frazier was forced to think about something else: a trade. The interest the Pirates received in Starling Marte was predictable given his age, contract situation and what he did in 2019, but general manager Ben Cherington getting so much attention for Frazier was something of a surprise.</p>
<p>Cherington will have to sort out whether it makes sense to trade the 28-year-old Mississippi State product — who became an everyday player for the first time in 2019 and led the Pirates with 152 games played — but Frazier plucked a positive from what might appear to some to be a tenuous situation.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot better than being on the other side of it, where nobody wants you,” Frazier said Saturday at PiratesFest. “That’s the way I look at it. But, yeah, it was definitely a weird feeling. Just because you could wake up the next day and be across the country or in different league, whatever it may be. Whatever life you have, you have to create a new one.”</p>
<p>That’s sort of what Frazier did this past season, actually, starting with a tip he received during spring training. That, Frazier said, came from either Pirates infield coordinator Gary Green, special assistant David Eckstein or third-base coach Joey Cora, and it went like this: right-left-catch.</p>
<p>Essentially it’s a rhythmic thing for Frazier in the field, a timing mechanism and something to do with his feet before fielding a ground ball. It appeared to work wonders. Frazier made just six errors over the 142 games in which he appeared at second base while posting an Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR) of 2.9 that ranked second among qualifying second basemen. In fact, only two second basemen in the National League had a better fielding percentage than Frazier (.989), who finished third behind Kolten Wong of the Cardinals and Atlanta’s Ozzie Albies.</p>
<p>“It was pretty cool to get that Gold Glove nomination, but I’d like to win it,” Frazier said. “There are no trophies for second or third place.”</p>
<p>Frazier said his confidence in the field actually started to improve late in the 2018 season, which is when he really started to feel comfortable at second base. Then when the reps became available, Frazier took the opportunity and ran with it.</p>
<p>“I knew if I wanted to further my career and have a chance to be an everyday guy, I needed to take that next step,” Frazier said. “I’m glad it happened. Hopefully I can build off that nomination.”</p>
<p>Whether or not he remains with the Pirates, a focal point in spring training for Frazier will be finding more consistent results at the plate. Though he finished with a .278/.336/.417 slash line to go along with 10 home runs, 50 RBIs and 80 runs, Frazier needed a strong finish to get there.</p>
<p>That started with a ridiculous run at the beginning of July, when Frazier went 9-for-10 with five doubles and a home run in back-to-back games against the Cubs. Frazier would win the NL Player of the Week award for a seven-game stretch in which he hit .600 with seven doubles, a home run and seven RBIs.</p>
<p>Only two NL hitters had a better average than Frazier (.331) from Aug. 20 through the end of the regular season.</p>
<p>“I’d like to not be a streaky hitter,” Frazier said. “Not striking out a lot allows me to not be a streaky hitter, I guess. There are definitely times where you get hot, way more hot than others. The slow start had a big impact.”</p>
<p>Frazier struck out 75 times last season, a number that’s not terribly high but one he’d probably like to tamp down some. Another important thing in this season ahead — again, assuming he stays — will be continuing to develop chemistry with his double-play partner, Kevin Newman.</p>
<p>The two spent most of 2019’s second half together every day after some early-season shuffling at shortstop and Newman finally winning the job for good.</p>
<p>As they began to jell, Frazier could anticipate where Newman liked to have the ball on a double play, where his misfires might go and when Newman might decide to flip underhand or provide more of a sidearm throw — all parts of a solid middle infield.</p>
<p>“I still think we’re growing together,” Frazier said. “Toward the last month and a half, we started getting a feel for all that.”</p>
<p>Assuming, of course, that Cherington doesn’t get an actionable offer for a player who has blossomed into one of the best second basemen in the National League, a player who has attracted plenty of interest from other clubs.</p>
<p>“ I wouldn’t say it all happened overnight,” Frazier said. “But it’s kind of the nature of the business with the trade possibilities and stuff like that. It’s pretty cool to be wanted. I just take it in stride. Whatever happens, happens. I can’t control it. Go with the flow.”</p>
