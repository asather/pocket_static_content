<h1>Is it time for the Penguins to make changes before it's too late?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins waited more than four-and-a-half months for their chance to play meaningful hockey. And, in a worst-case scenario, it could all be over in about four days.</p>
<p>After dropping Game 1 to Montreal in overtime, 3-2, the Penguins don’t have much time or margin for error in a shortened five-game series. OK, let’s not get irrational. The Penguins were one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference this year, and that was before they got everyone healthy and added players at the deadline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To quote the great philosopher Buzz Lightyear, “This is no time to panic.”</p>
<p>Or as Woody responded, “This is a <em>perfect</em> time to panic!”</p>

<p>To change the result, here are a few of the possibilities worth considering — and some Twitter takes that need to be debunked.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion: </strong>More Patric Hornqvist?</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:&nbsp;</strong>Coach Mike Sullivan made it clear. The Penguins need to get to the front of the net more to take away Canadiens goalie Carey Price’s sight lines. There’s a pretty easy way to do that. His name is Patric Hornqvist.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old isn’t just the Penguins’ best menace around the blue paint, he’s among the league’s most disruptive forces in front. Yet he played just 11:43 during 5-on-5 situations. Only his linemate, Patrick Marleau, logged fewer minutes at even strength. Both of these are indications that the third line centered by Jared McCann wasn’t getting it done.</p>
<p>A bold move would be to shake up the top line, playing Hornqvist alongside Jake Guentzel and Sidney Crosby. At a minimum, it’s hard to explain keeping Hornqvist off the top power play unit, which went just 1-for-7 and squandered 1:32 of 5-on-3 time. The lone goal came from the second unit after a screen in front from Hornqvist. Go figure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Give Hornqvist the power play promotion. Wait and see on the line shakeup.</p>
<p>Guentzel played the net-front role on the top power play, racking up more than twice as many minutes as Hornqvist. Yes, he’s a 40-goal scorer with elite hockey sense and underrated toughness. He also came within a post of scoring a power play goal from this exact location.</p>
<p>But is a 180-pound man the best option to stand in front of the net and absorb cross checks from 6-3, 225-pound Ben Chiarot?</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion: </strong>Make a goalie swap?</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:&nbsp;</strong>Given his track record of postseason success, it was no surprise that Matt Murray earned the nod in the net. Murray gave up some troubling rebounds, and his glove hand was trending again on Twitter. However, the blame for that second goal is misplaced. Defenseman Brian Dumoulin’s poorly executed pinch led to the odd-man rush. Even if Murray could have made that save, goal No. 1 came on a bad bounce and poor execution from Jack Johnson (more on him later). Goal No. 3 was an absolute rocket through traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> No. Just no.</p>
<p>Sullivan might have to switch goaltenders at some point. But to change the goalie now would be an absolutely unnecessary overreaction. Sullivan summed it up accurately and concisely when he said Murray was “solid.” He gave the Penguins a chance to win and should get that chance again in Game 2. There’s no reason to discuss the goalies more until proven otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>Mix up the blue line?</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:&nbsp;</strong>Jack Johnson sometimes gets more criticism than he deserves. But on the first goal, he got his money’s worth. During the rough sequence, Johnson took Zach Aston-Reese out of the play and then contributed to a bad bounce that landed in the back of the net.</p>
<p>Many fans have been clamoring for Juuso Riikola to supplant Johnson. Look, stop asking. It’s not happening. Riikola earned about a third of his starts at forward. The Penguins chose to play defensive call-up Zach Trotman on his off side instead of Riikola at one point. Sometimes it’s best to trust the coaching staff knows more about its players than we do.</p>
<p>Well, what about balancing the blue line?&nbsp;Johnson’s advanced metrics aren’t good at all. But they are the best, by far, with Marino, when the rookie was using his mobility and intelligence to cover for the veteran:</p>
<p>That idea makes sense in metrics land. But on the ice, the problem is it means playing Marino four fewer minutes in the third pair or Johnson four more minutes in the second. Neither is the right solution.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong>&nbsp;The best approach might be to just limit the third pairing minutes. If it gets to a point that the Penguins make a personnel change, the right-handed Chad Ruhwedel playing his off side seems more likely than Riikola getting a jersey.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:&nbsp;</strong>Stop rolling lines?</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:&nbsp;</strong>Three scoring lines led to back-to-back Stanley Cups for Sullivan and Co. How do you match up against Crosby’s line, Evgeni Malkin’s line and <em>then</em> a third scoring line? When it works, it’s a beautiful thing. But when it doesn’t work? Well, then you’re just taking ice time away from Crosby and Malkin for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The series is shorter. Maybe the bench should be, too, from time to time. As previously noted, the third line didn’t get a ton of ice time, but this trend could continue even more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:&nbsp;</strong>Add a spark off the bench?</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:&nbsp;</strong>Rookie forward Sam Lafferty was consistently one of the most noticeable players on the ice during training camp. He brings some size, good speed and young energy. Evan Rodrigues is a Swiss Army Knife, who can play in any of the three forward spots. Perhaps injecting one of them could send a message.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Where do they play? If Rodrigues comes in, Jared McCann could slide over to wing. Or if Lafferty earns a jersey, maybe Hornqvist goes to the top line and the rookie jumps in on the third line. It feels like too much of a change after just one game. Maybe a more subtle tweak to the forward corps makes more sense right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:&nbsp;</strong>Trust the process?</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:&nbsp;</strong>Maybe the boldest move might be to stand pat. The Penguins stormed out of the gate in Game 1. In the first period, they out-shot Montreal, 16-5. They out-chanced them, 13-3. And they had six high-danger scoring chances to the Canadiens’ two, according to Natural Stat Trick.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> While the first period was lopsided, the Penguins weren’t nearly as dominant the rest of the way. In the second and third periods, the Penguins out-chanced Montreal just 18-16 and had eight high-danger chances to Montreal’s six. Montreal dominated overtime, though, with 11 of the 18 chances and three of the four high-danger chances.</p>
<p>The Penguins should make tweaks, but not major changes. At least not yet.</p>
<p>So now what? Well, maybe Sullivan will heed some of these suggestions. Or maybe not.&nbsp;</p>
