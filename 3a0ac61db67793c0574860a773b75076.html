<h1>Pirates on pause: What role will potential rule changes play?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With MLB hoping to return soon, the Post-Gazette’s Jason Mackey and Mike Persak will analyze 20 issues related to the Pirates — think 20 Thoughts or questions about the team. They’ll run each weekday online through May 22 and will appear in print (or via other PG digital platforms) on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If/when Major League Baseball comes back this summer, it will almost assuredly look different.</p>
<p>The return-to-play proposals that have been floated almost all include the use of the designated hitter in the National League. There’s also talk about one or two doubleheaders per week, with each of those games lasting seven innings, in addition to the possibility that there could be some severe realignment, the American and National leagues no more.</p>
<p>Add it all together, and aside from the possibility Pittsburgh could share a division with the Yankees, Red Sox and Nationals, baseball’s potential rule changes in 2020 could actually stand to benefit the Pirates.</p>
<p>“I think the most important thing is we’re back to playing,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said on a Zoom call Monday afternoon. “I think we all want that, and whatever set of boundaries or guidelines that we have, we’ll adjust and go with it.”</p>
<p>To work through how potential rule changes could impact the Pirates, we’re going to break this discussion into three sections: What we know will happen, what probably will happen and what should happen.</p>
<p><strong>What we know</strong></p>
<p>The biggest part of what we know involves the new rule for bullpens, where relievers either have to face three hitters or finish an inning.</p>
<p>As far as left-handed specialists or relievers that might be used in matchup-based situations — the type of thing MLB seemingly wants to reduce — this should not impact the Pirates in a huge way.</p>
<p>None of their relievers are terribly split-heavy, with Richard Rodriguez actually faring better vs. lefties (.653 OPS against) than right-handed hitters (.766) throughout his career. Shelton probably wouldn’t have mixed and matched with setup man Kyle Crick anyway, and he surely wouldn’t have done it with closer Keone Kela.</p>
<p>Which leaves us, basically, with Edgar Santana, Nick Burdi, Rodriguez and Michael Feliz to worry about. Burdi’s sample size is small. Feliz has a .754 OPS lifetime against righties, a .748 mark against lefties.</p>
<p>Santana has been better against lefties (.786 OPS) than righties (.594), but splits here might not be the biggest factor. The right-hander is coming off Tommy John surgery and looked lights out in the spring. Either Santana pitches well and reclaims a key role, or he struggles and winds up in situations where splits don’t mean as much.</p>
<p><strong>What we expect</strong></p>
<p>The biggest focal point here should be the DH, especially because it actually means a decent amount to the Pirates.</p>
<p>League-wide, even the baseball’s biggest purist might have a tough time citing reasons to avoid using it, especially after pitchers slashed .128/.160/.162 in 2019 and struck out 43.5 percent of the time. The DH would make games more entertaining. It would also likely make them faster, with fewer changes to protect the pitcher’s spot in the order.</p>
<p>The next step many Pirates fans probably want to make here involves Josh Bell, saying he should be the team’s regular DH because he can hit and has struggled defensively. Sure, Bell did make 13 errors in 2019, second-most for anyone at his position, but he also arrived at spring training sporting an improved throwing motion and was seemingly ready to take a couple steps forward with his fielding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bell is not the only Pirate who would make for a smart play in that spot. The Pirates could need to keep Colin Moran’s bat in the lineup, while his glove remains a gigantic question mark. They also need an injection of power from Gregory Polanco, which could be compromised if the right fielder is unable to stay healthy.</p>
<p>“I think it’s something where we’ll probably float different guys through there,” Shelton said of how he’ll potentially handle the DH spot. “A lot of that will depend on who our personnel is, what our health is, what our situation is, to say specifically what we’re going to do with it. But I don’t see that we would David Ortiz it or Travis Hafner it, where one guy is doing it all the time. I don’t see us doing that.”</p>
<p>The tangential effect here, in addition to the expansion of rosters — another thing to expect if/when baseball resumes — could mean big things for the Pirates’ top position player prospect, Ke’Bryan Hayes.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, Hayes was ticketed to start the season with Class AAA Indianapolis. Now, the three-time Gold Glove winner in the minor leagues could easily be the Pirates’ opening day third baseman, with Moran the DH.</p>
<p><strong>What should happen</strong></p>
<p>Doubleheaders of two seven-inning games are a start, but MLB will likely take a look at more substantial changes. Think about this scenario: The Pirates are in Arizona. It’s been 100 or more degrees all week. They have a doubleheader Sunday, when it’s supposed to go up to 110. On Saturday night, do you really think anyone wants to play 18 innings and finish the game at 2 a.m. Sunday?</p>
<p>For functional purposes, it may be time to entertain extra innings with a runner starting on second base or, like the Korea Baseball Organization, simply being OK with ties during the regular season.</p>
<p>Keeping games a reasonable length given the time constraints here — both daily and beyond — should be something on which MLB focuses. Maybe that means the universal use of a pitch clock ... and sticking to it. Or, like the NHL, attaching some sort of cost to unsuccessful challenges.</p>
<p>MLB could also test drive a few things it has been flirting with for years. There has been talk about using robotic umpires but concern over whether the system would be up and running in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>What about only using it after a six- or seven-run lead has been established? Or, even more severe, what about simply calling games that have become blowouts, saving the wear and tear on players and keeping the featured TV product as watchable as possible?</p>
<p>Those ideas are obviously less concrete than the three-batter minimum or even the use of the DH, but if/when baseball resumes, it’s probably smart to expect a few key changes.</p>
<p><strong>STATISTICALLY SPEAKING: </strong>The players the Pirates used as their designated hitter in 2019 combined for 11 RBIs, which tied the Giants for the National League lead in that category. The Pirates got four home runs (second) from the DH spot and posted an OPS of .950, which was third in the NL.</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THIS: </strong>Bell has DH’d 10 times in his career. He’s hitting .325 (13-for-40) in that situation, with eight extra-base hits, four home runs and 11 RBIs. In those games — against American League teams on the road — Bell has a slugging percentage of .750 and an OPS of 1.167.</p>
<p><strong>THEY SAID IT: </strong>“The rule is going to change how people build their lineups and how managers manage their bullpen with right-left splits. There are a lot factors that come into play.” — Shelton on the three-batter minimum rule.</p>
