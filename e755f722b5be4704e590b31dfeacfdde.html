<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: Do some owners really want to spike the MLB season?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Chad:</strong> Why are the owners and Rob Manfred so willing to let this season die?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong>&nbsp;I had a completely different — and entertaining —&nbsp;answer written to this question, and just as I was about to hit send, news began to break that baseball is looking more and more likely in 2020. There are still owners who would rather not play, but even they can’t be dumb enough to not understand what is actually at stake here. Owners have tried to push their own agenda, and the players held their ground. There are still some things to be worked out, but I would expect that within a few days, we will have an agreement and plans for a season.</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong> Do you&nbsp;think the NFL is actually going to encourage players to kneel during the national anthem. Do you remember what happened the last time they did? They lost millions in revenue from fan backlash. There is a reason they don’t show the national anthem on their broadcasts anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> If Roger Goodell has a brain, he will make sure there is a coordinated show of concern for racial injustice. He would be smart to meet with some of the most outspoken players and Colin Kaepernick and say&nbsp;‘“How we can we as a league show unity and do it in a way that is inclusive and also respectful?” Don’t leave it to chance. If the entire league is engaged in some form of awareness move/protest, then it sends a very powerful message. You can’t, however, expect every player to kneel for the national anthem because some still see that as a sign of disrespect. The league could put together a coordinated and inclusive gesture that makes a far more powerful statement.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> What are your thoughts on Mike Gundy? He seems to be too old and too stuck in his ways to be a college football coach.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Gundy, the Oklahoma State football coach, is a conservative, so naturally he triggers the progressives among us. From what I’ve seen, though, he is mostly just a guy who says dumb things and tries to prove he isn’t going to be bullied. He seems mostly harmless to me, and frankly, you don’t last as long as he has and have the success he has had if you are completely out of touch with young people. I’d bet if you talk to many of his players, they love him and know he cares about them. If there wasn’t a respect between the two, no way Chuba Hubbard would agree to do a video like the one with Gundy that was posted online this week.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> Which mascots do you find to be the most offensive? I cannot believe in 2020 we still have a team called the Redskins.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I’m not the best person to answer this because I don’t get easily offended and am really not sure where the line is supposed to be drawn. Redskins and Rebels seem like easy ones, but I don’t know the origin of every team called the Rebels, so I can’t say definitively that is always offensive.</p>
