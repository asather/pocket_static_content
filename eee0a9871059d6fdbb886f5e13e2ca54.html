<h1>Gregory Polanco: 'It feels so good to be healthy'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — If you’ve been following Pirates camp thus far, you’d know that there have been several buzz words used during the first week. New manager Derek Shelton wants to foster an environment that allows the team to “change the narrative.” Shelton also intends for the Pirates to move forward from a disastrous 2019 and have fun.</p>
<p>Gregory Polanco fits all of the trends. It was clear upon his arrival Saturday that Polanco is eager for rebirth in 2020.</p>
<p>“I feel so thankful,” Polanco said. “I’m healthy. It feels great to be back. I’m happy to be back. It feels so good to be healthy.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Pirates director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk told reporters that Polanco was going to be able to work without any restrictions this spring.</p>
<p>“It’s monitoring his workload,” Tomczyk said. “The biggest challenge at the end of the season with Gregory was hitting. That issue has seemed to be resolved and rectified at this point, and we’re excited to see where that plays in camp.”</p>
<p>Polanco confirmed that assessment from Tomczyk on Saturday.</p>
<p>“I’m back to where I need to be,” Polanco said. “I want to go out there and play hard. I feel like I can be myself again.”</p>
<p>Polanco’s season came to an early end in 2018 with the shoulder injury. The outfielder never fully recovered from the surgery heading into the spring last year. Polanco wound up only playing 42 games with a .242 batting average to go with six home runs and 17 RBIs in 2019.</p>
<p>“I’m happy to be healthy. I thank God for everything,” Polanco said. “I can throw hard again. I’m ready.”</p>
<p>If Polanco can get back to his 2018 performance and stay healthy, he could play an influential role in the Pirates’ mantra of having fun.</p>
