<h1>Ducks claim former Penguins center Andrew Agozzino off of waivers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While the Penguins were busy doing their last bit of roster tinkering before the NHL’s trade deadline on Monday, Andrew Agozzino found a new home of his own.</p>
<p>The former Penguins center was claimed off waivers by Anaheim. It’s possible he’ll be in the lineup on Friday when Pittsburgh visits the Ducks.</p>
<p>Agozzino, 29, split this season between the American Hockey League and the NHL, playing 17 games with the Penguins. During Sunday’s 5-3 loss in Washington, he centered the Penguins' fourth line, playing between Sam Lafferty and Anthony Angello.</p>
<p>Just before Sunday’s game, Agozzino was placed on waivers, presumably to fulfill an NHL requirement. Per NHL rules, a player must be on an AHL roster at 3 p.m. on deadline day in order to be eligible to be sent down to the minors at any time thereafter for the rest of the season. Agozzino’s contract requires that he be placed on waivers before being reassigned.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Penguins may also choose to make a few more paper transactions on Monday. Sam Lafferty, Zach Trotman and Anthony Angello are three candidates to be reassigned to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, at least as a formality.</p>
<p>While losing Agozzino eliminates a depth center option from the organization, it's not incredibly significant. After adding Jason Zucker from Minnesota on Feb. 10 and Patrick Marleau from San Jose on Monday, Agozzino was going to have to fight to stay in the lineup. In fact, he was initially a healthy scratch for Sunday's game in the lineup sheet distributed to the media at Capital One Arena. However, when Dominik Kahun couldn't go after testing his injured leg in warmups, Agozzino was a late addition.</p>
<p>With Agozzino gone, the Penguins still have options at center. Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Teddy Blueger are locked in as three of the four centers. Jared McCann, Nick Bjugstad and Lafferty would be three options to eventually center a third or fourth line. Dominik Kahun and Dominik Simon could also play center in a pinch.</p>
