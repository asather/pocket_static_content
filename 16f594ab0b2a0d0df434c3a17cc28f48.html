<h1>Highmark shows operating gain for 11th straight quarter</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Highmark Health, parent company of Highmark Inc. insurance plans and the Allegheny Health Network, finished 2019 with an operating profit of $241 million on $18 billion in total revenue including investments, officials reported Monday, adding an 11th consecutive quarter of positive earnings to the books.</p>
<p>Revenue from ongoing operations, meanwhile, hit $3.6 billion, a $300 million increase from the prior year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The $241 million operating gain —&nbsp;representing a 1.3% operating margin —&nbsp;compares with $526 million for 2018.</p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Saurabh Tripathi said the decline reflects costs tied to investments such as the construction of AHN community hospitals as well as the organization’s intentional reduction of commercial and individual health plan premiums.</p>
<p>As a result of the lower premiums, he said Highmark saw a boost in health plan membership to 5.6 million in its core Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware market, up from 4.5 million in 2018. “And we put more money in our members’ pockets,” he added.</p>
<p>The insurer also reported a 97% retention rate on its commercial health plans.</p>
<p>On the provider side, AHN hospitals saw a 3% increase in patient admissions and observations for the year as well as a similar gain in outpatient registrations.</p>
<p>Among the Pittsburgh health system’s affiliated businesses, United Concordia Dental recorded a $116 million operating gain in 2019, HM Insurance Group stop-loss had a $63 million gain, Visionworks showed a $13 million operating gain and HM Health Solutions saw an operating gain of about $4 million.</p>
