<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Aldi stores across the country will be open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily starting today.</p>
<p>Some stores may have limited hours to accommodate restocking and cleaning.</p>
<p>Aldi CEO Jason Hart said its teams are working diligently to keep shelves stocked as it reacts to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>"In the midst of increased demand and challenging supply, we are focused on the products you are likely to want most: water, pantry staples, pre-made meals, cleaning supplies, toilet paper and more.</p>
<p>"To support as many customers as possible, you may see quantity limits placed on select items," Mr. Hart said in a news release. "We appreciate your patience as some of these products may be temporarily unavailable in some of our stores."</p>
<p>Aldi announced Friday it was&nbsp;intensifying cleaning practices at all of its stores, offices and warehouses.&nbsp;</p>
