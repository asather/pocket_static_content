<h1>Educator, former prosecutor vie to unseat incumbent in Pa. House 30</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One’s a former public school teacher who served as chief of staff to a state lawmaker before advocating for early childhood education with a Pittsburgh nonprofit.</p>
<p>The other’s a Navy veteran who’s done his own nonprofit work repairing homes for low-income elderly Pittsburghers, before clerking with the&nbsp;Allegheny County District Attorney’s office,&nbsp;working as a prosecutor there then starting his own law office.</p>
<p>These pieces of biographical information are at the heart of the race for the Democratic nomination in the 30th state House district, as both Lissa Geiger Shulman, the educator, and Marco Attisano, the veteran and former prosecutor, claim their own experiences make them — and not the other — more capable of forming relationships in Harrisburg and bringing back crucial funding to the area.</p>
<p>Besides the fact they’re trying to eventually unseat incumbent Republican Lori Mizgorski in the general election, the candidates are similar in more than one way; both are first-time political candidates, both were hesitant —&nbsp;in interviews —&nbsp;to pinpoint their ideological differences, and both insisted they can be successful in Harrisburg regardless of which political party is in the majority.</p>
<p>Ms. Shulman said her&nbsp;“real world” experience as a teacher, an advocate — currently with the nonprofit Trying Together —&nbsp;and someone who’s done constituent work has allowed her to build relationships with legislators on both sides of the aisle. She said she understands how Harrisburg works, and would know how to bring resources back for economic development, infrastructure projects and transportation investment.</p>
<p>“I’m somebody who would be prepared on day one,” Ms. Shulman said.</p>
<p>Mr. Attisano described his background as a&nbsp;“life of service,” formed by his upbringing by a single mom and two older sisters, and time spent in public housing and a women’s crisis shelter as a child. At 17, he enlisted in the Navy, beginning a path that took him from construction sites and disaster zones to AmeriCorps, the district attorney’s office and eventually, his own law office.</p>
<p>He said his experience as an attorney, in particular, has prepared him for an environment where coalition-building and negotiating is essential — and that serving as a state lawmaker would allow him to work on issues that affect people across the district and state.</p>
<p>“For me, that’s really what I think prepares me well: that I’ve lived this life of service, been engaged for 15 years in different forms, and [had] personal experiences growing up in poverty and overcoming economic challenges,” Mr. Attisano said.</p>
<p>Along with her background, Ms. Shulman said she’s offering “a really bold vision” for the district — which extends from Fox Chapel and a chunk of O’Hara up through Hampton to the&nbsp;Pittsburgh North Golf Club in Richland. She’s released several detailed policy plans on topics ranging from education to the COVID-19 response. On education, for example, she wants to increase the overall level of funding to schools and would push for universal Pre-K.</p>
<p>Ms. Shulman said she understands the needs of working families, and as a working mom, identifies with the importance of paid family leave and a higher minimum wage.</p>
<p>Having worked for State Rep. Dan Miller from 2013 to 2016, Ms. Shulman said she learned the importance of being accessible to constituents, and of bringing together stakeholders from across the district to talk about issues that are bigger than one municipality.</p>
<p>Mr. Attisano said he focuses on problem-solving instead of ideology, and that he’d use this pragmatism to defend workers rights and support unions. His first priority in Harrisburg, he said, would be to build relationships and make progress on infrastructure funding, especially as it relates to storm-water management.</p>
<p>“The folks I’m talking to, they’re just not seeing the infrastructure and flood repair and prevention dollars coming back from Harrisburg,” Mr. Attisano said, adding that he doesn’t think enough funds from Pennsylvania’s gas tax are going toward infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>Ms. Shulman mentioned flooding as a main concern, too, and said that she’d want to address it regionally. Her environmental policy plan details how she’d work to ensure that water systems and local water and sewer authorities remain public, and that lawmakers convene with local officials to&nbsp;“hold discussions and develop watershed plans for upstream development.”</p>
<p>The primary election is June 2.</p>
