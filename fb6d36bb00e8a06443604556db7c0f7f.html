<h1>Another walkoff win demonstrates progress for Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kevin Newman has produced some fun and memorable walkoff wins throughout his young career, victories filled with exciting plays and clutch moments that are worth watching over and over again.</p>
<p>This was not one of those.</p>
<p>But the fact that it happened, and also how it happened, may have said something about this Pirates team — a disaster during the first 20 games of the season but a .500 club over its past 20 after Tuesday’s 5-4 walkoff victory over the Chicago White Sox at PNC Park.</p>
<p>The win was made possible by a tapper back to the pitcher from Newman, resulting in a rushed flip home from Jimmy Cordero that catcher Yasmani Grandal could not handle. Measured by Statcast at 2 feet, the dribbler allowed pinch-runner Jason Martin to score from third.</p>
<p>It was the sixth walkoff for Newman in his career, all since the start of the 2019 season.</p>
<p>“Just went up there and tried to make good, solid contact,” Newman said. “That’s not how it went. But we got the win, so that’s all that matters.”</p>
<p>It’s similar to the Pirates’ season in a way. They began 2020 dripping with optimism. Under a new regime, things would be different — more intentional with their work, better pitching, a rejuvenated offense, maybe even some small ball and a cleaner team game.</p>
<p>Through the first third of this shortened season, almost none of that happened. The pitching had problems … and injuries. Lots of injuries. Errors occurred. And the only thing small turned out to be batting averages.</p>
<p>Give manager Derek Shelton, his coaching staff and Pirates players credit: They kept plugging along. Erik Gonzalez seized a role. Guys like Newman and Bryan Reynolds have battled sophomore slumps but have shown signs. Josh Bell has had bursts of power, too. Even Gregory Polanco, so frustrating at times, has shown splashes of improvement.</p>
<p>Are the Pirates out of the woods? Heck no. But have they been playing respectable baseball? Yeah, mostly.</p>
<p>“They continue to put themselves in situations where we give ourselves an opportunity, and they finished the game [Tuesday],” Shelton said. “It was nice to see.”</p>
<p>The winning rally started with singles from Polanco and Bell, the two of them actually staying within themselves and not trying to win the game with one swing. For Bell, it was the second consecutive game he started a ninth-inning rally.</p>
<p>Then the White Sox walked Ke’Bryan Hayes to pitch to Newman, which was an interesting choice given his history with walkoff wins.</p>
<p>Down by two in the eighth, the Pirates mounted another late rally, which included back-to-back doubles from Newman and Jacob Stallings to start. That cut Chicago's lead to 4-3 before Gonzalez tied it with a run-scoring single.</p>
<p>An earlier outburst came in the fifth, when Bell doubled the other way, and Hayes tripled off the Clemente Wall in right. The Pirates scored a second run on Newman’s infield single.</p>
<p>“Guys are putting together good at-bats, hitting balls hard and getting on base,” Newman said. “That’s the name of the game.”</p>
<p>Among the other encouraging stuff Tuesday was starting pitcher Joe Musgrove, who went four innings, allowing three hits, no runs and striking out five.</p>
<p>Musgrove’s breaking stuff was sharp, and he seemed to find his control after a couple of wobbly moments early. His night was done after 64 pitches because he’s still working his way back from injury, not because of the comebacker he took off the calf.</p>
<p>"Just really beared down and was able to execute enough pitches to get out of that first one," Musgrove said. "After that, I felt pretty good. Slider sharpened up. I got some good action on the sinker. That got me out of a couple at-bats. Elevated a couple fastballs. I think we executed the game plan tonight pretty well from the second on.”</p>
<p>The Pirates also saw some solid outfield defense in this one.</p>
<p>Adam Frazier and Reynolds made diving catches, while Reynolds kept up his strong throwing. After nailing Nick Madrigal trying to score in the fifth, he's now tied for the National League lead in outfield assists with five, four of those coming at home plate.</p>
<p>Reynolds might owe Stallings a pop for this one, too, as Stallings caught the ball and reached quickly to his left to apply the tag on Madrigal, which ultimately withstood a White Sox challenge.</p>
<p>"That’s a tough play to dive back and get it," Shelton said. "He did a really good job.”</p>
<p>It was not a great night for Dovydas Neverauskas, who gave up three runs in the fifth. They came on a single from Yoan Moncada and a two-run homer by Grandal. It was the fourth home run Neverauskas has allowed in 15 innings this season.</p>
<p>The Pirates' bullpen had been a big part of their turnaround, with that group allowing a major league-low .190 batting average against over the past 19 games along with an ERA (2.74) that ranked as the third-lowest in MLB.</p>
<p>And even though that part of their game wasn't as crisp as it has been, the Pirates scratched and clawed enough to grab another walkoff win, one that might've lacked in visual appeal but definitely felt pretty darn good.</p>
<p>"It’s a perfect chance for us with no pressure to go out there and perform and put to work some of these things that we’re working on every day before games," Musgrove said. "Although it might seem to some people like this season’s come and gone, we can really make a lot of ground up in these last 20 games and prove ourselves for next year.”</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>Frazier extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a single in the sixth inning. ... Gonzalez extended his to nine games with his single.</p>
