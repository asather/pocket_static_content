<h1>Kris Letang sloppy, Tristan Jarry outplayed as Florida Panthers take down Penguins, 4-1</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kris Letang is a special talent, a perennial All-Star and a winner.</p>
<p>He will have a lengthy reel of jaw-dropping plays when he decides to hang up his skates. But beyond that he makes a positive impact most nights with his supreme skating, slick passing and the courage to try stuff others wouldn’t dare.</p>
<p>Of course, on his off nights, when his gambles backfire, the Penguins accept the consequences, figuring he will get back to changing games in a good way.</p>
<p>The past month, though, there have been a few clunkers for Letang, including Sunday’s 4-1 loss against the Florida Panthers at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
<p>“I made some mistakes. It is what it is. It was a bad one,” Letang admitted, later adding, “It was not great from start to finish. You try to forget about it.”</p>
<p>To be clear, Letang wasn’t the only reason the Penguins lost. They obviously got just one goal, giving them six in three games since losing Jake Guentzel. They went 0 for 3 on the power play. Tristan Jarry was good but got outplayed.</p>
<p>It certainly didn’t help that it was their third game in four days and Sunday’s start time was 5 p.m., giving the road-weary Penguins two fewer hours to rest.</p>
<p>But Letang’s play has been a roller coaster since sturdy partner Brian Dumoulin had ankle surgery Dec. 1 that will sideline him at least a few more weeks. He had a strong game against Ottawa last Monday and some rough moments since.</p>
<p>Letang took a penalty in overtime Thursday that set up San Jose’s game-winner. In a 3-2 overtime win Saturday in Montreal, Letang made a careless pass in front of his net that led directly to a Canadiens goal. Sunday was the fifth time in the past 15 games that Letang was on the ice for multiple goals against at 5-on-5.</p>
<p>He hasn't offset it with scoring. He has one point in the last seven games.</p>
<p>Less than three minutes in Sunday, Letang lost a race, something that doesn’t happen often, even with Letang closing in on his 33rd birthday. Fatigue might have been a factor. He logged 53 minutes of ice time over the weekend.</p>
<p>Frank Vatrano got a step on him in the neutral zone and kept him in the rearview as he broke in on Jarry. Jarry stopped his first shot but not the rebound.</p>
<p>“He came with a lot of speed and he drove the net. And he was able to get a shot off and the rebound just went straight to his stick,” the goalie said.</p>
<p>Dominik Simon set up Jared McCann on a 2-on-1 to make it 1-1. But later in the first period, another giveaway by Letang ended up in the Penguins net.</p>
<p>The fourth line got outworked for about a minute by their Florida counterparts then had to stay on after icing the puck. Letang, whose shift also dragged on, had a chance to get the Penguins out of the zone but couldn’t connect on a breakout pass to Thomas Di Pauli. Panthers blue-liner Mike Matheson kept it in.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh native Vincent Trocheck then put a centering pass through Letang to Brett Connolly, who beat Jarry upstairs to put the Panthers back on top.</p>
<p>Letang had another bad giveaway in the third period, coughing up the puck at his blue line with the Penguins down two goals. But Jarry bailed him out.</p>
<p>Asked about Letang’s giveaways, a couple of them costly, this weekend, Mike Sullivan said he would like him to “simplify his game in those situations.”</p>
<p>“Him and I have had this conversation. It’s ongoing usually with us,” the coach said. “Tanger has the ability to be a difference-maker and we certainly don’t want to take the stick out of his hands. But as we say to all of our players, sometimes the best play is a simple play. And it’s just recognizing those situations.”</p>
<p>Sullivan added: “It’s not going to be perfect out there, especially for the guys that log the type of minutes that Tanger logs. It’s not going to be a flawless game. But certainly that’s a conversation that Tanger and I have fairly frequently.”</p>
<p>After Connolly’s goal, the Panthers threatened to pull away from the Penguins but Jarry wouldn’t allow it. He stood his ground on a breakaway by Aleksander Barkov late in the first period. A few minutes into the second, a backdoor pass made it through to Aaron Ekblad. Jarry sprawled to get his blocker on that.</p>
<p>Florida’s Chris Driedger came through with key saves, too. In the second period, he shuffled across to rob Zach Aston-Reese on a 2-on-1 and later got his blocker on a shot by Simon after McCann sprung him on a partial breakaway.</p>
<p>The two teams continued to trade chances in a fun third period. McCann nearly scored for the Penguins after bouncing the puck up in the air with his blade four times before batting a shot on goal. But the Panthers pushed it to 3-1 with 11:08 left in the game when Mike Hoffman sniped Jarry from the high slot.</p>
<p>Jarry, whose six-game winning streak was snapped in Thursday’s overtime loss to San Jose, lost back-to-back starts for the first time in two months. He was sturdy, stopping 31 of 34 shots. But Driedger, who made 31 saves, was better.</p>
<p>Evgeni Dadonov scored an empty-netter to seal thex Panthers victory.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we managed the game well enough,” Jack Johnson said. “We knew today was going to be a tough game for us. And I just think the lesson from that is under the circumstances we were in, make sure we play with our heads more than anything, because we know it’s going to be tough physically.”</p>
<p>The Penguins next will play Tuesday. That road game at Vegas is their first stop on a weeklong road trip that includes games at Colorado and Arizona.</p>
