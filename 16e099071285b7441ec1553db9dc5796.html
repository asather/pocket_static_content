<h1>As weather warms, city officials stress social distancing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor William Peduto and public safety officials on Friday provided updates on the city’s actions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, but the message they repeatedly stressed was social distancing, particularly in parks as the weather warms up.</p>
<p>At the same time, the city announced that all playgrounds, courts and playing fields are now closed to the public.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>During an outdoor press conference on the North Shore, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said that residents should expect to see a "larger police presence" in parks, but that the city is not currently looking to write citations for people violating social distancing guidelines because that requires police officers and residents to interact closely, putting both at risk.</p>
<p>"However, depending on what happens this week, we may have to take further action at the same time next week," Mr. Hissrich said. "There might be people cited in the following weeks or the parks may have to close."</p>
<p>“Today is the beginning of the pivotal period of time in our battle against COVID-19,” he said. “This is like a bad dream, and we are trying to prevent it from becoming a nightmare.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hissrich reported that several emergency personnel are self-quarantined after coming into close contact with individuals who later tested positive, including seven firefighters, two EMS personnel, and one police officer. One firefighter tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Wednesday.</p>
<p>All public safety personnel are being screened before coming to work, and Mr. Hissrish said that between 30 and 50 employees each day are being sent home due to exhibiting a fever or other COVID-19 symptoms — but that no other employees have tested positive.</p>
<p>Assistant EMS Chief Mark Pinchalk said that the department's pandemic operation plan had been modified to fit COVID-19 and implemented at “level 1,” meaning “normal operations with enhanced surveillance.” He added that two units had been designated as “pandemic control units” that are given the highest-risk calls and manage decontamination of all units after emergency calls are completed.</p>
<p>“Those two units right now are really keeping the rest of the system running,” Chief Pinchalk said.</p>
<p>He added that the department had begun using telemedicine to communicate with potential cases that are not exhibiting serious respiratory symptoms. The department assumes “every case” is potentially COVID-19, and employs personal protective equipment on every call. Officials said the&nbsp;city’s stockpile of the equipment should last several weeks, at least</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto and Mr. Hissrich offered additional details on the city government’s response. Mr. Hissrich confirmed that the city, county, state and federal governments are working together to create plans for the use of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center as additional hospital space in the event of a surge in cases in Allegheny County. Mr. Peduto added that stress on hospital capacity is a possibility.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto also said that the city’s finances are difficult to predict right now due to the uncertainty of the length of the pandemic, but said that the city “will have a deficit this year” and will have to rely on the reserve fund. He added that he believes there will be another stimulus package passed by Congress that will provide direct aid to local and state governments.</p>
<p>“Our economy will never come back if all of our states and cities are bankrupt,” Mr. Peduto asserted. He also said that layoffs of city employees is “at the bottom” of the list of potential actions to help the city recover financially.</p>
<p>Public safety deparment Medical Director Dr. Ronald Roth stressed social distancing measures, which recommend that everyone remain at home and maintain a distance of at least six feet from other people when outside in order to protect family members and emergency personnel.</p>
<p>“If you’re sick, stay at home, maintain social distancing, and wash your hands,” Dr. Roth said. “Please keep us all safe.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh is the regional epicenter of the virus outbreak, Chief Pinchalk said, and the region is still in the “acceleration phase” of the infection curve. He added that the city has “a long way to go” before returning to more normal conditions.</p>

<p>“When history looks back, they will look back at April 2020, and they will ask, ‘What did you do to minimize the spread of this deadly virus?’” Mr. Peduto said. Adding that there will be at least “several weeks” under current rules, the mayor issued a plea to Pittsburgh residents: stay at home.</p>
<p>“There have been sacrifices made by generations before us,” Mr. Peduto said, “that asked a lot more of the people than to stay inside.”</p>
