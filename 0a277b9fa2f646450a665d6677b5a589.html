<h1>Despite stay-at-home order, Erie County executive left jurisdiction to join family in New York</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Five days after she issued a stay-at-home order for her county to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Erie County Executive Kathy Dahlkemper was at her cottage across state lines in Ripley, N.Y., playing cards with her family.</p>
<p>Ms. Dahlkemper said she went to the cottage —&nbsp;where her daughter and grandchildren had been staying for two weeks —&nbsp;for “essential personal business,” and stopped to play a “quick game” with her grandson outside, maintaining her physical distance, before returning home to Erie, 22 miles to the west.</p>
<p>Erie resident Brenton Davis, whom Ms. Dahlkemper labeled a political opponent who has aspirations to run against her in 2021, said she violated her own stay-at-home order and put her residents’ lives in danger upon return by failing to self quarantine. Mr. Davis called for her resignation and shared a photo of Ms. Dahlkemper playing cards in New York —&nbsp;posted to her daughter’s public Instagram account —&nbsp;with several media outlets.</p>
<p>The picture was posted on March 29, five days after Ms. Dahlkemper and Pennsylvania officials told Erie County residents that they could only leave their residences for tasks essential to their health and safety, or that of their families.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.goerie.com/news/20200324/erie-county-issues-stay-at-home-order" target="_blank">Erie Times-News</a> at the time, Ms. Dahlkemper also recommended on March 24 that anyone returning to the county from travel outside the jurisdiction should self-quarantine for 14 days.</p>
<p>“They should self-quarantine in the house, and where there are other people they should use a separate bathroom,” Ms. Dahlkemper said then, according to the newspaper. “They should be in a different area of the house, not touching the same surfaces.”</p>
<p>Mr. Davis, in a letter to the county executive and media outlets, wrote that her failure to self-quarantine upon return from Ripley “has the potential for massive impacts within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Erie County/Government, those working at the tip of the spear to defend our community against this pandemic, and our entire community at large.”</p>
<p>Ms. Dahlkemper, in a letter of her own, said her daughter and grandchildren left their home in Philadelphia on March 14, the day schools closed there, to move into her cottage to keep safe from COVID-19, since her grandson and granddaughter have health conditions that put them at greater risk of contracting the virus.</p>
<p>She didn’t detail what “essential personal business” she tended to at the cottage more than two weeks later, but said she’s continued to follow her own guidance.</p>
<p>“And of course, the health and safety of Erie County residents is always my priority,” Ms. Dahlkemper added.</p>
<p>Ms. Dahlkemper accused Mr. Davis of “politicizing the crisis.”</p>
