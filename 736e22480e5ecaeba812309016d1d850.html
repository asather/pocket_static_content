<p><strong>Q. I recently purchased the Polk LSiM707 floorstanding speakers you recommended. I now want to upgrade my disc players because the new speakers reproduce sound much better than my old speakers did.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I currently have two Blu-ray players, a Sony UBP-X800m2 and an Oppo BDP-83. I have these players because they can play my DVD-A, SACD and DTS discs, as well as CDs. I want a player that sounds better than what I have now, but realize I may not find one that plays all the different kinds of discs I have. If I can’t find something that plays them all, I would like to find a player that sounds amazing with what it does play. My budget is $1,000 or less, but I could be flexible. It will not be used for video, just audio.</strong></p>
<p><strong>— B.A., Tracy, Calif.</strong></p>
<p>A. “Universal players” such as yours that play every disc format imaginable are very rare now that Oppo is gone. The Pioneer UDP-LX500 is the only one I know that is still being marketed, and it is hard to find; it is rumored to be discontinued. I would not wager heavily that it would be dramatically better than your Oppo BDP-83 in the sound quality department, even with the speakers you have. An Oppo BDP-105 checks all your boxes, but they are over $1,000 used.</p>
<p>After a lot of thought, I came to the $599 Emotiva ERC-4 CD player as the best solution. I have the model below it, the Emotiva CD100, and it was noticeably better than the unit it replaced, which was no slouch. Use the ERC-4 to play your CDs and continue to use the other players for your DVD-A, SACD and DTS discs. You will then have the best of all worlds. emotiva.com</p>
<p><strong>Fiport No Touch Door Opener, package of four for $14.99:</strong> Every day, we are reminded of viral spread and how important it is to sanitize or wash our hands frequently. It has made me very mindful of how often I touch surfaces that are constantly touched by others. Whenever I grab a door handle or use my debit card with a PIN pad, I immediately reach for the little bottle of sanitizer in my pocket to clean my hands. It’s inconvenient and messy.</p>
<p>I have seen brass door opener/interface devices for sale for as much as $40 each and had been thinking of getting one. When I saw the Fiport No Touch Door Opener and the very low price, I figured I would give it a try. I was impressed enough to share the news with my readers who may also appreciate such a device. It definitely brings peace of mind and is quite satisfying to use.</p>
<p>The Fiport opener comes on a key ring and is strong and stiff. Opening a typical commercial door in a public place is easy, and even doors that have a twisting handle (not doorknob) can be readily manipulated. It is also easy to use with a PIN pad at the ATM or the grocery store, or to flush toilets. No more touching dirty surfaces!</p>
<p>It can be located on Amazon by searching for the specific term Fiport No Touch Door Opener. (When I wrote the column and went back to double-check the Amazon search, I got FSPORT a bunch of times so I had to refine the search term so it would work reliably for everyone.) At only $14.99 per four pack, I am buying more to give to friends and family. Stay safe and healthy, everyone!</p>
