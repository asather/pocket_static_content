<h1>City Council begins discussion on police reform in wake of protests</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council members on Tuesday called for robust discussions on the intersection of race, policing and community funding as Councilman Ricky Burgess introduced several police reform bills.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess, who has long brought up the issue of racism to his fellow council members, introduced four pieces of legislation with the aim to:</p>
<p>• prohibit the city’s acquisition of military equipment and weaponry</p>
<p>• require a&nbsp;“duty to intervene” on behalf of police employees who witness&nbsp;“inappropriate force”</p>
<p>• move $250,000 from police salaries to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/01/08/Anti-gun-violence-coordinator-Burgess-shootings-murders/stories/201901080124" target="_blank">a gun violence prevention fund</a></p>
<p>• require a budgetary obligation to that fund.</p>
<p>The proposals come in the wake of sustained protests after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a Minneapolis police officer held his knee to Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes while three other officers stood by. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/06/08/Derek-Chauvin-bail-court-appearance-charges-George-Floyd-murder-manslaughter-Minneapolis-police-department/stories/202006080094" target="_blank">All four officers have been fired and charged</a>.</p>
<p>One of the local protests — on June 1 in East Liberty where police deployed tear gas, bean bag and sponge rounds — is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/03/Pittsburgh-citizen-police-review-board-protest-east-liberty-tear-gas-floyd/stories/202006030102" target="_blank">under multiple investigations</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I have spent 60 years plus in our city with friends and family talking about our feelings about our safety and well being and the lack of opportunity to African Americans in our city,” Mr. Burgess said. “And now we are facing this time kind of unrest and a new future. For me, it is 60 years, maybe a couple hundred years overdue. But we’re at this moment and at this time. So this is, in many ways, the moment of my life.”</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto on Thursday <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/04/Pittsburgh-mayor-police-use-of-force-reforms-policy-george-floyd/stories/202006040132" target="_blank">endorsed the adoption of a national campaign</a> aimed at limiting certain uses of force by police, among other measures.</p>
