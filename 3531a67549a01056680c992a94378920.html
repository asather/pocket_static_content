<p>Pennsylvania has processed about 70% of the unemployment claims it has received since mid-March, when the economy largely shut down in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>But, many people have yet to see those benefits in their bank account or mailbox — and have yet to get any answers about why.</p>
<p>“One of the major issues with the [unemployment] system both here and elsewhere is nothing is broken down in plain language, and if you’re unfamiliar with the system, you’re not going to know what any of that means,” said Julia Simon-Mishel, a supervising attorney for Philadelphia Legal Assistance, which helps Pennsylvania residents file for unemployment compensation.</p>
<p>“These systems are the safety net, [but] are really not set up to be as user friendly as it needs to be,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>1. Have you been approved?</strong></p>
<p>For people who applied several weeks ago but have yet to see any benefits, the first question to ask is whether you have actually been approved, Ms. Simon-Mishel said.</p>
<p>Receiving a PIN, or personal identification number, in the mail&nbsp;is needed to complete the online application, but it does not guarantee you are eligible for benefits, she said.</p>
<p>Often the state’s unemployment centers are still determining an applicant’s financial eligibility, which will arrive as a separate letter.</p>
<p>Just like PINs and other official documentation from the state, that letter has been going out late and some people will start to receive benefits before it arrives, Ms. Simon-Mishel said.</p>
<p>In determining financial eligibility the state looks at, in very basic terms, whether the applicant has been consistently attached to the workforce. That depends on two factors: how much you earned and when you earned it.</p>
<p>“Unemployment is actually not about the job you just lost,” Ms. Simon-Mishel said. “They look at your entire recent employment history.”</p>
<p><strong>2. If not, you have options</strong></p>
<p>People who are found not eligible for unemployment compensation have three options, she said:</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, an applicant must also prove they are looking for work, but Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration waived that requirement because of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>3. Other helpful tips</strong></p>
<p>Navigating the system is a complicated process that isn’t clear to even the most seasoned professionals, Ms. Simon-Mishel said.</p>
<p>To clear up some confusion, here are more tips from the state’s unemployment website:</p>
<p><strong>‘Don’t panic’</strong></p>
<p>“In the best of times, when things are running very smoothly, it takes between two and three weeks to get benefits. That’s considered by the Department of Labor to be speedy processing,” said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project.</p>
<p>“There was just an exponential increase in claims. I can imagine no state is paying claims within two to three weeks right now.”</p>
<p>For applicants, she said, “Don’t panic. This isn’t your fault. This is a systemwide problem.”</p>
