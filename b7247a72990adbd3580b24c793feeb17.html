<h1>Jack Johnson's Penguins tenure is coming to an end</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em><strong>THIS STORY WILL BE UPDATED:</strong></em></p>
<p>When the Penguins acquired <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/25/mike-matheson-penguins-trade-patric-hornqvist-deal/stories/202009250137" target="_blank">left-shot defenseman Mike Matheson</a> from the Florida Panthers on Sept. 24, general manager Jim Rutherford hinted another move might be on the horizon.</p>
<p>Asked about the logjam on the left-side of the blue line, Rutherford said, “Something will have to give.”</p>
<p>On Monday, the other shoe dropped. The Penguins placed left-shot defenseman Jack Johnson on waivers for the purpose of a buyout, freeing up some much-needed salary cap space and ending the tenure of one of the most often-criticized Penguins players in recent memory.</p>
<p>Prior to the buyout, Johnson, 33, had three years remaining on a deal that carries a $3.25 million average cap hit. The buyout reduces the salary cap hit, while spreading the remainder out over twice the length of his current contract.</p>
<p>The cap hit will be as follows:</p>
<p>• 2020-21: $1,166,667</p>
<p>• 2021-22: $1,166,667</p>
<p>• 2022-23: $1,916,667</p>
<p>• 2023-24: $916,667</p>
<p>• 2024-25: $916,667</p>
<p>• 2025-26: $916,667</p>
<p>In terms of real money, the Penguins will pay Johnson $5.5 million instead of $8.25 million. According to CapFriendly, the Penguins are now $4,718,158 under the $81.5 million cap, although signing the restricted free agents who were tendered will eat up a significant chunk of that.</p>
<p>With Johnson gone, the left-side of the blue line is coming into focus. Brian Dumoulin, Marcus Pettersson and Matheson will be the three starting lefties. Juuso Riikola, who signed a two-year extension this offseason, is next up on the depth chart. Left-handed prospect Pierre-Olivier Joseph is also knocking on the door at the NHL level, although Rutherford has noted previously that Joseph can also play his off side to challenge Chad Ruhwedel for playing time.</p>
<p><strong>Simon not extended qualifying offer</strong></p>
<p>Also on Monday, the Penguins extended qualifying offers to five restricted free agents, Matt Murray, Sam Lafferty, Anthony Angello, Sam Miletic and Pontus Aberg.</p>
<p>Missing from that list is Dominik Simon.</p>
<p>As it currently stands, Simon will be scheduled to free to sign with any team when unrestricted free agency begins on Friday. The Penguins will have a hard time fitting Simon into what limited salary cap space they have. However, it doesn’t entirely preclude them from reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>“Jim [Rutherford] has openly said they really like Dom and would like to find a way to bring him back if possible,” Simon’s agent, Allan Walsh, told the Post-Gazette on Monday morning. “We’re certainly going to explore that.”</p>
<p>“We are open to negotiating with Pittsburgh at any time.”</p>
<p>Among the other restricted free agents, Murray is the most noteworthy. The Penguins have so little cap space that a trade remains the most-likely outcome. The Penguins have reportedly engaged in trade talks with a number of teams.</p>
<p>If the Penguins don’t move Murray during what’s traditionally one of the busiest trading periods on the calendar, it could lead to a challenging — and messy — arbitration case.</p>
<p>The other unique case among the RFAs is Pontus Aberg, who was acquired in the Kasperi Kapanen trade. While the Penguins retain his rights by extending a qualifying offer, he will still play in Russia for a year.</p>
