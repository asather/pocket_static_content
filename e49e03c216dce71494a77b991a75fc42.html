<h1>Pirates players welcome ‘a good different’ with netting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Jacob Stallings has been coming to LECOM Park for eight years, every spring since the Pirates picked him in the seventh round of the 2012 MLB draft.</p>
<p>What Stallings saw Saturday morning before Pittsburgh’s Grapefruit League opener against the Minnesota Twins was different than anything he’s witnessed in the previous seven years.</p>
<p>All around the playing field here is protective netting, installed to keeps fans safe. And while the Pirates, in a release Friday, said it was designed for “maximum transparency,” you obviously see something; it all looks a little different, and players noticed as they went through morning workouts.</p>
<p>“You’re just used to walking by all the fans on your way to the dugout,” Stallings said. “It’s definitely different. But a good different.”</p>
<p>Stallings’ opinion is universally echoed around the Pirates clubhouse, where those guys believe this move was long overdue.</p>
<p>“Players want the fans to relax,” Trevor Williams said. “The chances of getting hit by a ball are very slim; however, you shouldn’t have to be on the edge of your seat the whole time. Here at LECOM, the way that the seats jut out behind the coaching box, it’s just dangerous.</p>
<p>“The games can get long. You’re going to be talking. There are a lot of phones now. The players want the fans to relax. Nobody wants to see a fan get hit. The best decision we could have made was putting netting here and in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>There is a tradeoff, as fans will have a more difficult time approaching players for autographs. However, if the netting keeps everyone safe — which it obviously will — players will make that trade every day of the week.</p>
<p>“I know it kind of stinks from the standpoint of fans wanting autographs, but as a player, I’ve seen too many people get hit in the head over the years,” Stallings said. “To me, it’s just not worth it. I’m glad they did it. I think it will definitely create a safer environment and ultimately a more enjoyable atmosphere for fans.”</p>
<p><strong><span>Hair up</span></strong></p>
<p>When Blake Cederlind decided last February to grow his blond hair out, never did he think it would come to this.</p>
<p>On Saturday, as the Pirates held their first on-field workout at LECOM Park, several members of the pitching staff wore blond wigs as a tribute to Cederlind’s flowing locks.</p>
<p>Cederlind, who was scheduled to pitch later in the game and didn’t have to arrive until 10 a.m., saw pictures of the gag on social media.</p>
<p>“I was dying laughing,” he said.</p>
<p>The prank started after a video of Cederlind appeared on Twitter, where he was shaking his blonde hair in semi-dramatic fashion.</p>
<p>Once again, something he didn’t really foresee happening a year or so ago.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think it would take off like this,” Cederlind said.</p>
<p><strong>Holland ready</strong></p>
<p>Derek Holland is starting to fit in nicely with the Pirates, his light-hearted personality glaringly obvious. On Sunday, Holland will get his first chance to make sure the baseball matches the laughs.</p>
<p>The left-hander will start against the Tigers at LECOM, which is one of two split-squad games on the day.</p>
<p>“I just have to keep doing what I’ve always done, which is get out there and establish things,” Holland said. “This is the time to work on it, but at the same time, I have to compete, too. I’m competing to get a job, period. It could be for the starting rotation. It could be bullpen. I still need to be focused on making this team. I want to be part of this. I want to be able to help these guys grow with their careers.”</p>
<p>Other scheduled pitchers behind Holland include Steven Brault, Richard Rodriguez, Sam Howard, Keone Kela, Robbie Erlin and Tom Koehler. Backing up Williams will be Hector Noesi, Cody Ponce, Nick Burdi, Blake Weiman and Montana DuRapau.</p>
<p><strong>Spring things</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy spring training but don’t take it too seriously. Remember that last year the Pirates’ leader in hits (16) and batting average (.372) was JB Shuck, while Jung Ho Kang hit a team-high seven home runs. Nick Kingham (20 2/3) pitched the most innings.</p>
