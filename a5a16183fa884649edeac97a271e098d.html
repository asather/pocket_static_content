<h1>Pittsburgh man charged with fraudulently buying, reselling cars in large-scale scheme</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man is facing dozens of felony and misdemeanor charges after allegedly committing a large-scale scheme involving the illegal purchase and resale of vehicles across Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio.</p>
<p>Authorities said that Henry Reese, of Pittsburgh, allegedly used fraudulent checks to buy cars from dealerships and resold the cars to private individuals, without using the proper registration or title transfer and without collecting sales tax.</p>
<p>As a result, police said that the victims in this case cannot keep the vehicles they purchased from Mr. Reese and have now lost the money they paid for them.</p>
<p>The investigation into the scheme was jointly conducted by the Pennsylvania State Police and the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office, and involved multiple jurisdictions, including Allegheny, Washington, Westmoreland, Indiana and Erie counties.</p>
<p>Mr. Reese, 54, is being held in Allegheny County Jail on unrelated charges.</p>
<p>The new charges that Mr. Reese will be served include 29 felony counts of theft by deception, 22 felony counts of receiving stolen property, 19 misdemeanor counts of bad checks, 18 counts of operation of a motor vehicle without financial responsibility, nine counts of fraudulent transfer of ownership of vehicles and one count of criminal attempt.</p>
<p>Police said Mr. Reese will be arraigned on these new charges “sometime in the near future.”</p>
