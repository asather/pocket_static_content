<h1>Josh Bell on Jackie Robinson, Jacob Blake and the need for change</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Josh Bell would never turn down the opportunity to honor Jackie Robinson.</span></p>
<p>But this time, for this series, felt especially appropriate.</p>
<p>And needed.</p>
<p><span>Taking the field Friday about 45 minutes from where Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by a Kenosha, Wis., police officer, Bell said he was excited to honor Robinson’s legacy while also continuing to advocate for social and racial change in the world.</span></p>
<p>“For me personally, I feel like Jackie Robinson represented so much change in the game, change that you see right now across the league, change that you see across all sports,” Bell said. “I feel like, for us, for players, for Black athletes, we hope to see more change.</p>
<p>“We don’t know what it’s going to look like. I feel like Jackie didn’t know what it was going to look like. But he knew that he was going to have to take some backlash, and he did. I feel like a lot of the players right now are taking some backlash, but they are willing and able to take it full on. It’s exciting to hope for the change in the future and to see what the world looks like in the future.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The backlash Bell mentioned likely stems from those who disapprove of teams deciding to cancel games or players sitting them out as a form of protest.</span></p>
<p>Bell said players talked for 30 or 40 minutes Thursday about potentially not playing a doubleheader against the Cardinals but ultimately decided to take the field, believing logistics were not on their side but also knowing the conversation was far from finished.</p>
<p>The Pirates first baseman also commended those who decided to make a statement and hopes that MLB — and really all sports — can do enough to spur substantive change.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Bell specifically referenced Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts, who said he would have sat out Wednesday’s game had his teammates decided to play. He also applauded Cardinals outfielder Dexter Fowler, who did miss his team’s game Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bell smartly and eloquently tied the racial issues facing today’s baseball stars — and the world —&nbsp;with what Robinson experienced while breaking MLB’s color barrier on April 15, 1947.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“It’s definitely an interesting time,” Bell said. “All the guys who sat out, I commend them. I feel like there’s so much wrong in this world that can be righted. It seems like, if nobody does anything, nothing is going to change. If Jackie Robinson never played, the game wouldn’t look the way that it looks right now. People are trying to do what they can.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Especially today, Jackie Robinson is a hero for so many. And he was an enemy for so many as well. When I see Mookie, Fowler, guys like that, those are heroes in the game. It was awesome to be able to see they were doing to at least make a statement to try and push for that change, whatever it might be. To continue to push, to continue to acknowledge that we’re not where we can be as a nation, but we’re going to fight to get there. It’s not going to be easy. But it’s going to be worthwhile in the end.”</span></p>
<p>Watching the Blake shooting was tough for Bell, as it has been for so many.</p>
<p><span>It has spurred even more conversations among Bell and Pirates teammates, as well as between Bell and some of his family members. A big topic has been all the negativity that exists in the world today but also how Bell hopes that everything happening as a result fixes the many problems that we face as a country.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The same as looking back at Robinson and what he did for equality in baseball, Bell hopes the actions being taken by professional athletes across all sports will help to spur the same sort of change and acceptance.</span></p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to recognize and acknowledge that there’s bad in this world, but still try to fight for the change that’s going to be the good,” Bell said. “I think that’s where I’m at. I know that these horrific acts aren’t going to be the last ones that are talked about, but hopefully one day, they will end.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Hopefully one day it will be the last one, things will change, and legislation will change and society will change as a whole to make life better for younger generations across the board. It’s definitely tough, but I guess one day I’ll look back on these times and be thankful.”</span></p>
<p>Bell is part of the Players Alliance, a group of over 100 Black current and former baseball players. On Thursday, that group announced it would collectively donate salaries from games on Aug. 27-28 as part of Jackie Robinson Day in MLB.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">On Friday, Bell explained his reasoning behind that decision and also how excited he was to be part of a group advocating for much-needed change.</span></p>
<p>“I think it was just recognizing that we have to put our money where our mouth is,” Bell said. “I think this world is run by the dollar. We can say a lot, but it means a lot more if we can go out in communities and actively do. That’s just a sign of us doing.</p>
<p>“I know there’s going to be a lot more to come. Everybody with the Players Alliance is doing a great job this season. I’m excited to be a part of it in the future.”</p>
