<h1> Boeing papers show employees slid 737 Max problems past FAA </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Lawmakers on Capitol Hill lashed out at Boeing on Friday after the release of a batch of emails and text messages in which company employees questioned the safety of the now-grounded 737 Max, called the aircraft a “joke” and talked about how they concealed problems from regulators.</p>
<p>In the messages, released nearly a year after two deadly Max crashes plunged the vaunted aircraft manufacturer into the biggest crisis in its history, employees also called proposed pilot training on the jet a “turd,” wrote that few of those on the Max team were interested in the truth, and bragged about using a “Jedi mind trick” to sway some regulators.</p>
<p>Some of the discussion centered on problems with the company’s flight simulators, which are used to develop new planes and then train pilots on them.</p>
<p>“Would you put your family on a MAX simulator trained aircraft?” one employee asked another. “I wouldn’t.” The other employee responded: “No.”</p>
<p>The documents, made public Thursday by Boeing at the urging of Congress, fueled allegations that the company put speed and cost savings ahead of safety in rolling out the Max. Boeing has been engulfed in turmoil since the two crashes involving an Indonesian airliner and an Ethiopian jet five months apart killed 346 people.</p>
<p>Investigators believe the crashes were caused when the jetliners’ brand-new automated flight-control system mistakenly pushed the planes’ noses down.</p>
<p>Boeing is still struggling to fix the software and get the plane back in the air, and it is unclear when that might happen. Last month, it fired its CEO and announced it was suspending production of the Max. Federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., accused Boeing of a pattern of deception and said that if the company had been more honest sooner, “potentially we could have saved the lives of 346 people.” His counterpart on the House Transportation Committee, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., put the blame on pressure from higher-ups inside the company “to save money and make it more marketable.”</p>
