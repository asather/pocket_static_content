<h1>Lawyer says EMS dispatch report may contradict narrative of Romir Talley shooting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The attorney for the family of a man fatally shot last year by Wilkinsburg police says an EMS dispatch document suggests officers chased the wrong man.</p>
<p>Attorney Paul Jubas this week provided the dispatch notes of a 911 call with Eastern Area Prehospital Services the night that Romir Talley, 24, was killed by Wilkinsburg Police Officer Robert Gowans during an early-morning foot chase on Dec. 22, 2019.</p>
<p>Mr. Jubas said the notes raised questions about the moments that immediately preceded Mr. Talley’s death after police pursued him into a dark alley, but county police said such documents offer an incomplete record of what happened that night.</p>
<p>The case has received scrutiny particularly since Wilkinsburg police officers do not wear body cameras.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Police in a December press release said a 911 caller at 1 a.m. on Dec. 22&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/12/31/Allegheny-County-police-Romir-Talley-Wilkinsburg-police-shooting-details/stories/201912310117" target="_blank">told emergency dispatchers</a> that a Black man in a black jacket and grey sweatpants, with black dreadlocks, brandished a silver handgun at the caller near the intersection of Penn Avenue and Wood Street in Wilkinsburg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two Wilkinsburg police officers, one of whom was Officer Gowans, were dispatched to the area in a marked vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The officers interviewed two people. Then the officers saw a man, later identified as Mr. Talley, who was wearing clothes which matched the suspect description. They drove their squad over to him and saw he also had a hairstyle matching the description.</p>
<p>The original 911 caller, still on the phone with an operator, could see the officers and told the 911 operator that the officers had located the man with the gun. That information was then relayed to the officers.</p>
<p>Both officers exited the squad car and told Mr. Talley to&nbsp;“take his hands out of his pockets,” the release reads.</p>
<p>Mr. Talley ignored officers’ commands to stop and he fled, county police said. The officers chased him through a vacant lot on Penn Avenue between two buildings that led to Stoner Way, an alley way behind the buildings.</p>
<p>But the dispatch notes provided by Mr. Jubas show a discrepancy at this point. The documents say the 911 caller was still on scene at the intersection of Penn Avenue and Wood Street.</p>
<p>According to the documents, operators around 1:07 a.m. asked the caller where he was and he “got agitated and said,&nbsp;‘Why does it matter?’” The caller then told operators that the police&nbsp;“pulled down into an alleyway and should’ve kept going on Penn” and the “male is still on Penn.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The call subsequently disconnected.</p>
<p>As officers chased Mr. Talley in the dark, county police said Mr. Talley&nbsp;fired one round at Officer Gowans, who returned fire and struck Mr. Talley seven times.</p>
<p>The moments between the foot pursuit and Mr. Talley’s shooting were only 43 seconds, ending at 1:06 a.m., county police said. Police recovered a silver revolver at the scene “with one spent cartridge recovered from inside the&nbsp;cylinder below the hammer. Four live rounds were recovered from the cylinder.”</p>
<p>County police Superintendent Coleman McDonough said the department stands by the events outlined in their original press release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Mr. Jubas is only referring to one piece of information among many,” Superintendent McDonough wrote in an email. He said the EMS notes are&nbsp;“not as comprehensive” as the police dispatch records, “nor does Mr. Jubas apparently have access to all the recorded 911 calls or other investigative materials.”</p>
<p>The county police turned over their findings to the Allegheny County District Attorney’s office for review.</p>
<p>Mr. Jubas said he wants the DA’s office to release the 911 call and Officer Gowans’ statement so people can determine whether Mr. Talley was the correct suspect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The [Talley] family, from the get-go, was adamant that this was a case of mistaken identity,” Mr. Jubas said, noting Mr. Talley did not have a criminal history.</p>
<p>The spokesman for the DA’s office, Mike Manko, said the EMS notes have “previously been provided to an independent agency, the Allegheny County Police Department, and is also part of our ongoing review.”</p>
<p>Asked whether the office would release the audio of the 911 call when the review was completed, Mr. Manko said,&nbsp;“The matter is still under review at this point. That’s all I can say.”</p>
<p>Last month, District Attorney Stephen Zappala criticized Wilkinsburg for its lack of body cameras, saying he found it “ironic that federal, state, county and local officials, especially Wilkinsburg officials, will not invest in transparent and objective criteria to assist in evaluating such a significant event.”</p>
<p>He continued,&nbsp;“The lack of this type of evidence has greatly complicated the process that my office has in place to deal with these types of investigations."</p>
<p>Since December, the case has led to calls for transparency and protests in Wilkinsburg. Mr. Jubas said he plans to file a civil rights lawsuit against the borough and the police department. He is also pushing for the borough to obtain body cameras and dashboard cameras for their officers.</p>
