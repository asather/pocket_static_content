<p>Westmoreland County will be moving into the “green phase” of reopening on June 5, Westmoreland County officials confirmed Friday.</p>
<p>"I'm very happy to see [Gov. Tom Wolf] move Westmoreland County into the Green phase of re-opening," county Commissioner Doug Chew said in a written statement. “We’ve only had a couple dozen new positive cases over the last 2 weeks.”</p>
<p>In his statement, Mr. Chew cited the need to “get back to normal and back to a robust economy.” He said that moving to green is “another step in the right direction.”</p>
<p>“Our County neighbors are ready and begging to return to work,” Mr. Chew said, “so hopefully it won’t be much longer before we have all restrictions lifted, and we’re in the ‘Freedom Phase,’ as my colleague Commissioner Kertes calls it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chew said that he is not “overly concerned” about the potential for increased cases, and pointed out that many of Westmoreland’s new cases have been in nursing homes with limited access to public spaces.</p>
<p>“We will undoubtedly see some increases,” he added, but said that the county’s public safety department would continue “close monitoring so that Westmoreland County citizens are protected.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many other counties in Western Pennsylvania will be moving into the “green phase” — the final phase of the governor’s reopening plan due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf has scheduled a press conference at 2 p.m. today, when he is expected to announce additional counties moving to different stages of reopening on June 5.</p>
<p>Allegheny County and most of the rest of the southwestern region moved to yellow on May 15. Beaver County moved to yellow a week later, in part due to the sizable outbreak at the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center.</p>
<p>Eighteen counties in the northwest and north-central regions of the state moved to the green phase today: Bradford, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Crawford, Elk, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, McKean, Montour, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, Venango and Warren.</p>
<p>Additionally, eight counties moved to the yellow phase today: Dauphin, Franklin, Huntington, Lebanon, Luzerne, Monroe, Pike and Schuylkill counties.</p>
