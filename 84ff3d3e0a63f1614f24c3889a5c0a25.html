<p>The state’s death toll due to COVID-19 eclipsed the 2,000 mark as it reported 338 new deaths connected to nursing and long-term care homes, with eight of the deaths occurring in Western Pennsylvania, according to the latest data released Wednesday by the health department.</p>
<p>Beaver County reported six new deaths and Westmoreland County reported two deaths at those facilities, the state said. The numbers also indicate that a death that was erroneously reported in Allegheny County was connected to a nursing facility.&nbsp;“Data had been incorrectly input into the reporting system and the error was found and corrected upon review,” the county said in a release.</p>
<p>With Allegheny County’s corrected toll, its number of deaths is now 86, with 65 of them occurring at nursing homes. Of Beaver County’s 65 deaths, 58 are connected to nursing homes. In Westmoreland County, whose coroner’s office counts 30 dead, 22 of them have occurred at nursing homes, the state reported.</p>
<p>With the latest figures, there were 38 new cases of COVID-19 reported in Allegheny County. Since its first case was reported on March 14, the county has reported 1,273 total cases&nbsp;— 1,229 confirmed and 44 probable. A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to a statement accompanying the numbers.</p>
<p>Of the county’s deaths, 76 are confirmed and 10 are probable.</p>
