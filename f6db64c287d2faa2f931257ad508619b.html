<h1>Steelers practice report: Observations from the first day in pads</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As is the tradition, the Steelers rookies took center stage Monday afternoon in the first padded practice of training camp. And as is the case when practice is in front of fans at Saint Vincent College, the highlight of the day before an empty Heinz Field was the backs-on-backers drill.</p>
<p>Running backs and tight ends align in the backfield and block oncoming linebackers. It’s a drill coach Mike Tomlin loves because of its competitiveness and what it unveils about the players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rookie outside linebacker Alex Highsmith and running back Anthony McFarland got some extra special attention during the drill, with each getting rematches on multiple occasions with their opponent.</p>
<p>“I just want to see them acclimate to the environment,” Tomlin said. “It’s an NFL competition period. It has that level of intensity and that level of talent. Those guys that are new to this level, it’s a period of adjustment. And that period of adjustment takes physical reps.</p>
<p>“So, younger guys like McFarland and the same thing with Alex Highsmith, we realize reps are the platform for learning. They’re going to get reps. It’s their job to adjust and to show rapid improvement.”</p>
<p>The first padded practice took place before a few dozen reporters and team scouts in an otherwise empty stadium. It was a far cry from the atmosphere that can be electric at Saint Vincent College when fans sit at Chuck Noll Field and react to the thud of the bull rushes and the ability of the backs to stand up against the competition.</p>
<p>“Oftentimes, the first time you do backs-on-backers it’s more about new people getting adjusted to the intensity of the drill and learning how important technique is,” Tomlin said. “It’s a lot of teaching and learning the first time through. Always a good reflection of backs-on-backers is the second time we do it. Guys have a chance to digest and learn, so I’ll be excited the next time we do it.”</p>
<p>After backs-on-backers, the Steelers went straight to a live 11-on-11 offense versus defense period that featured the only tackling of the day. The practice lasted 83 minutes.</p>
<p>“I liked the competitive atmosphere and an awareness of how we need to work in this environment,” Tomlin said. “We’re faced with some unique challenges in terms of the training camp process, evaluations without preseason games. Today was a good start in that regard.”</p>
<p><strong>Observations</strong></p>
<p>Starting quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who is returning from elbow surgery, did not visibly show any effects of the procedure. He and the receivers continue to work on timing.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger did have a few highlights during practice:</p>
<p>• Rookie receiver Chase Claypool made a leaping catch in the corner of the end zone and veteran tight end Vance McDonald caught a contested deep ball over starting strong safety Terrell Edmunds.</p>
<p>• Veteran running back Wendell Smallwood struggled to stand up to the linebackers in backs-on-backers, but he showed some pop getting through the holes in the live run period.</p>
<p><strong>Injuries</strong></p>
<p>Right guard Dave DeCastro, center Maurkice Pouncey, receiver James Washington and defensive lineman Chris Wormley did not practice. Pouncey was excused for “personal reasons” and Tomlin indicated that DeCastro, Washington and Wormley had “minor physical ailments” and could be considered “day to day.” Defensive line coach Karl Dunbar said Wormley has a lower-body injury.</p>
<p>“I fully expect those guys to be full participants in the next couple of days,” Tomlin said.</p>
<p>On Pouncey, Tomlin added: “Hopefully, he’ll be back in a short period of time.”</p>
