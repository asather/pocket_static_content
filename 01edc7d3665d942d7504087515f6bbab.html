<h1>Penguins' Brandon Tanev looks back on Frozen Four-clinching goal five years later</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Five years before Brandon Tanev and Evan Rodrigues became Penguins teammates, they found themselves on opposite sides of a high-stakes, college hockey chess match.</p>
<p>In the 2015 national championship between Boston University and Providence College, the score was tied with just more six minutes remaining. BU burned a timeout after icing the puck, giving both teams a chance to get fresh bodies on the ice.&nbsp;At this critical moment, the Terriers played their ace card: the highest-scoring line on the highest-scoring team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The line was centered by Jack Eichel, at the time a freshman sensation who led college hockey with 71 points and was just months away from becoming the second overall pick in the NHL draft. On his wing? Rodrigues, a junior who ranked second in the NCAA in scoring with 61 points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Providence countered. To harass BU’s powerhouse tandem, the Friars went to their shut-down third line. The trio featured now-Devils center Kevin Rooney, Steve McParland and Tanev.</p>
<p>As Providence assistant coach Steve Miller drew up an offensive-zone faceoff play that the Friars had practiced all season, Tanev looked at Rooney.</p>
<p>“I swear to god, if you win this faceoff, I’m going to score a goal,” Tanev remembers saying.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside the Penguins dressing room, neither Tanev nor Rodrigues has mentioned that defining play… at least not yet. But this week — when the Frozen Four would have been played if not for the COVID-19 pandemic — maybe it’s time to look back at that 2015 championship.</p>
<p>Though the game was played on April 11, 2015, the stage was set years earlier.</p>
<p>Providence and Boston University entered the matchup in different places in the college hockey landscape. BU was a perennial powerhouse with five national championship wins and 11 title-game appearances. Providence, meanwhile, was just a few years removed from futility.</p>
<p>When the program shook up the staff and hired former Union coach Nate Leaman in 2011, the Friars were floundering after five consecutive losing seasons. Leaman began looking for fast, physical players to help him build something when he stumbled across Tanev playing in a summer tournament.</p>
<p>“I would say he was very much an unknown,” Leaman said. “I bet it was just the Union staff and our Providence staff that knew much about Tanny. And I would say [Rochester Institute of Technology] because that’s where his brother [Christopher] went.”</p>
<p>Tanev was a late bloomer who even <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/10/02/brandon-tanev-penguins-contract-sidney-crosby-2019-20-nhl/stories/201910020127" target="_blank">gave up hockey for a period of time</a> during high school years. He stood only about 5-foot-9 at the time Leaman found him. In the British Columbia Hockey League that was known for offense, Tanev produced a whopping 33 points. But Leaman saw something.</p>
<p>“We were building a program at the time that was ranked 58th out of 60 teams in the country,” Leaman said. “I loved his speed. I loved his relentlessness. I loved his compete. That’s what we wanted to build the program with, speed and compete and relentlessness.”</p>
<p>Tanev joined the Friars’ rebuild for the 2012-13 season. At the end of that same 2012-13 campaign, BU was in the midst of its own coaching change.</p>
<p>Longtime Terriers bench boss Jack Parker announced his retirement after 876 wins, three national championships and 40 seasons. One of those rumored for the job is another familiar name for Penguins fans.</p>
<p>“When we had our coaching change after my sophomore year, [Mike Sullivan] was mentioned in it,” Rodrigues remembers. “His name was getting swirled around. I don’t know how serious it was.”</p>
<p>Sullivan, a BU grad who played under Parker and still often references his old coach’s lessons, interviewed back in Boston. But the position instead went to another BU grad, David Quinn.</p>
<p>After a dismal 10-21 season in Quinn’s first season, the Terriers enjoyed an 18-win improvement in 2014-15, the fifth-best turnaround in NCAA men’s hockey history. They won the Hockey East tournament and earned a No. 1 seed in the 16-team tournament.</p>
<p>Providence, meanwhile, had been eliminated in a Hockey East quarterfinal series. They spent the next couple days crunching the numbers and sweating out their chances. When the bracket was finally revealed, they earned a No. 4 seed and the final at-large bid in the NCAA tournament.</p>
<p>“We knew we were a good enough team to go into the tournament and win the national championship,” Tanev said. “I think all we needed was one of those spots.”</p>
<p>Tanev’s Friars opened the Frozen Four at T.D. Garden in Boston by dominating Omaha.&nbsp;The Mavericks only briefly cut the score to one goal in the third period <a href="https://www.omaha.com/sports/college/uno/providence-s-unrelenting-pressure-tops-uno-in-frozen-four/article_7bd575a4-df10-11e4-88d6-5ba529033a71.html" target="_blank">when a shifty sophomore found the net</a>&nbsp;— some kid named Jake Guentzel. But the tally from Sidney Crosby’s future linemate wasn’t enough, as Providence advanced to the title game with a 4-1 win.</p>

<p>Going into the national championship against BU, Tanev’s assignment was the same then as it often is today on the Penguins: Shut down the opponent’s top line. In this case, that meant trying to slow the potent Eichel-Rodrigues tandem. From the opening faceoff of the game, those two lines went head-to-head.</p>
<p>“You want to be able to shut down an opponent’s top line,” Tanev said. “I think especially when you’re at that stage in college hockey, your dream is to win a national championship. That’s what you play for. The stakes become higher. You want to elevate your game.”</p>
<p>The Friars struck first in a back-and-forth game. But BU answered by scoring two goals just four seconds apart. Aside from setting an NCAA tournament record, the second goal showed the brilliance of Eichel, who won a faceoff at center ice, raced into the Friars zone and set up teammate Danny O’Regan beautifully.</p>
<p>At the end of two periods, BU led 3-2. The Terriers’ 40 shots on goal through two periods set another NCAA title game record.</p>

<p>Then, in the third period, Providence got a break on one of the flukiest goals in tournament history. Providence’s Tom Parisi dumped the puck into the zone and headed for the bench. Like an outfielder camping under a can of corn fly ball, BU goalie Matt O’Connor gloved the harmless shot. But when the BU goalie dropped it, he accidentally knocked it into his own goal, tying the game.</p>
<p>The momentum swung toward Providence. After an icing, BU called that timeout, setting up the key faceoff. With the play drawn and Tanev calling his shot, the players from both sides took the ice.</p>
<p>“Every faceoff play we ever ran, everything we did had to be through Brandon,” Rooney said. “That’s the type of guy he is. He always wants the puck on his stick, especially at key moments of the game. That’s kind of what makes him so special.”</p>
<p>The faceoff was on the right circle. Tanev lined up on the right side next to the wall, the farthest player away from the net. The puck dropped. Using his signature speed, Tanev bolted across at the same time Rooney won the draw on his backhand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s almost like the puck sat there, waiting for me to pick it up,” Tanev said.</p>
<p>Tanev ripped a wrist shot over the BU goalie’s left shoulder. The play would later be described on Providence’s website as the biggest goal in program history.</p>
<p>In a blur of black and white, Tanev flew past the Providence bench in celebration. In the TV copy of the game, the camera panned to Rodrigues, dejected, and then back to Tanev fist pumping to the crowd.</p>
<p>As the horn sounded, the Friars hoisted the trophy and posed for a team photo. Today, that photo hangs in Tanev’s father’s basement, along with Tanev’s No. 22 jersey and a piece of the net. It remains a lasting reminder of a game Tanev will never forget.</p>
