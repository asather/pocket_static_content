<h1>Bob Petcash is new boys basketball coach at Pine-Richland</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Petcash brother has been in the Pine-Richland basketball team’s starting lineup for the past seven seasons. Next season, their father will be the Rams’ head coach.</p>
<p>Bob Petcash was hired Monday night as Pine-Richland’s new coach. He is the father of Andrew, Dan and Joey Petcash, who all played for the Rams.</p>
<p>“They’re all happy for me,” Bob Petcash said. “It could always be fun for maybe one of them to come back someday and be an assistant coach.”</p>
<p>Bob Petcash was a Pine-Richland assistant coach the past six seasons under Jeff Ackermann, who left to become the coach at Baldwin. Petcash, 54, spent 11 other seasons as a coach for Pine-Richland at the freshman and junior-high levels.</p>
<p>Over the past five seasons, Pine-Richland has been one of the most successful programs in the WPIAL. The Rams won WPIAL championships in 2016-17 and lost in the 2018 title game. Bob Petcash, who makes a living as an oral surgeon, went through three interviews with Pine-Richland over the past few weeks before the school board officially hired him.</p>
<p>“Pine-Richland has great tradition and a lot of success in all sports, so this is exciting for me,” Petcash said. “I’m just looking forward to putting a good staff together and build on the tradition that’s already here.”</p>
<p>As for Bob Petcash’s sons, Andrew and Dan were both Post-Gazette Fabulous 5 selections and are playing college basketball. Andrew Petcash, Pine-Richland’s all-time leading scorer, will be a senior at Boston University while Dan will be a sophomore at Binghamton. Andrew Petcash started on the two WPIAL championship teams. Youngest brother, Joe, will be a senior guard at Pine-Richland.</p>
<p>Bob Petcash said he has hoped to be Pine-Richland’s head coach for a number of years.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard the comment from people that ‘Bob Petcash will only be the coach for a year or two because he wants to see his sons play in college,’” Bob Petcash said. “I would never do that to a program. How do people know what I want to do? I wanted this job. I’ve thought about it for a while.”</p>
