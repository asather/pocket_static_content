<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A pick-up truck towing a trailer full of cows jack-knifed and struck a concrete median Tuesday on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Irwin, killing four of the 135 calves aboard, officials said.</p>
<p>The crash happened around 5:30 a.m. at the westbound Irwin interchange, turnpike officials said.</p>
<p>The pick-up truck and trailer were using the exit ramp.</p>
<p>Authorities said some of the surviving calves may have sustained injuries in the crash.</p>
<p>No people were harmed.</p>
<p>Turnpike workers built a temporary corral for the surviving calves in a grassy area behind the interchange, according to turnpike spokeswoman Rosanne Placey. The works were assisted on scene by a team of three veterinarians, Ms. Placey said.</p>
<p>Ms. Placey said a replacement trailer was sent to pick up the livestock.</p>
