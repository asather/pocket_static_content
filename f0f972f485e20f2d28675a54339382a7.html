<h1>Brian O'Neill: Any flush means a wild ride through Pittsburgh </h1>

<p>Follow the flush.</p>
<p>Maybe you don’t want to think about it. Maybe you do. But the latest blessing in this age of miracles and wonders is the ability to track what you just flushed all the way to the Alcosan plant.</p>
<p>It may be disconcerting to learn that what you left in the toilet tank is getting around more than you do. But 3 Rivers Wet Weather, in collaboration with Civic Mapper and Alcosan, has a website called&nbsp;<a href="https://flush-it.civicmapper.com/" target="_blank">“Flush It!”.</a> Since my first visit to the site a few days ago, I’ve begun to associate that familiar bathroom sound with a starting gun.</p>
<p>“The flush travels 32,134 feet (6.09) miles through the sewer network before reaching the ALCOSAN treatment facility,” I was told after I punched in my home address.&nbsp;“It could take anywhere between 4 and 9 hours ... during typical dry-weather conditions.”</p>
<p>Most of us can walk faster than that. But included was a helpful map that showed my, ahem, stuff heading southeast from my Allegheny West home, under West Ohio Street through historic Allegheny Commons Park, then heading toward the trendy North Shore. It flows under PNC Park before making a hard right in a massive underground pipe that hides along the Allegheny River and then the Ohio on its way to the big plant by the old prison.</p>
<p>Were I beginning at a more prestigious suburban address such as, say, the Edgewood County Club, the stuff would travel almost 23 miles and take up to a day to reach the plant. It would travel through nine boroughs, then cross under the Monongahela from Greenfield to the South Side, recross the Mon east of the Liberty Bridge, then follow under Fort Pitt Bridge to the Point, where it crosses under the Allegheny at the Point to join the same big pipe mine uses on its route to treatment.</p>
<p>That’s quite an engineering feat, when you think about it. It’s also one when you don’t. This site has been online for more than a year, and perhaps you have the same two questions I had upon learning of it: 1) Why wasn’t I notified sooner? Who decided it was a good idea?</p>
<p>I met with Emily Mercurio and Christian Gass of Civic Mapper, the company that first designed this application for an Alcosan open house in 2016, where it was a smash hit with treatment plant tourists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emily Mercurio, CEO and co-founder, said,&nbsp;“We all participate in this system one way or another.”</p>
<p>(One way would be No. 1, the other No. 2, by traditional scoring methods.)</p>
<p>“But we don’t like to talk about it,” she said.</p>
<p>No, we mostly don’t. But Alcosan and its feeders are in the midst of a $2 billion plan to build miles of underground storage tunnels, and take greener approaches, to reduce the 9 billion gallons in sewage overflows that go into our rivers each year during our rainy days. It’s only getting rainier, so it might be helpful for the 825,000 people in Pittsburgh and 82 surrounding municipalities to know how tricky a path to purity each of our flushes commences.</p>
<p>“It’s interesting to me that something from my house is out there having its own life for like a day ...&nbsp;“ Ms. Mercurio said.</p>
<p>“Like on a&nbsp;‘Lord of the Rings’ journey,” Mr. Gass added.</p>
<p>Don’t wait for that sequel. But as Emil Faber, founder of Faber College, said,&nbsp;“Knowledge is good.” We now have the technology for anyone to see how that last flush was merely the first step of a meandering path that ultimately puts the flushed stuff into pipes so large you could drive a Volkswagen through them, as Mr. Gass put it. (That would be in drier circumstances, of course.)</p>
<p>Oh, to be single again. I imagine this would be quite the icebreaker in the bars of Pittsburgh:&nbsp;“I couldn’t help but notice you coming out of the rest room. Did you know that from here it may take 17 hours ...”</p>
<p>The map should be visible on any smart phone. You’re welcome.</p>
