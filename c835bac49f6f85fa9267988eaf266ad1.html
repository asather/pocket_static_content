<h1>Matt Vensel's Penguins chat transcript: 08.01.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Good morning, Penguins fans. Holy smokes, hockey is here! Wasn't sure we'd see it this summer. With Game 1 tonight, let's chat at 11 a.m. Submit your questions now. Excited to talk hockey with you. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Hey, Pens fans. We'll get this going in two minutes. Need questions in the queue! So what's on your mind heading into tonight? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: By the way, my prediction is Pens in 5. Tell me why I'm wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: What if the habs play the same system as the isles last year and pounce on their opportunities w Price backstopping them? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Then the Canadiens will have a chance to steal this series. While they aren't as stingy structurally as the Isles were last season and aren't as physical, they have a lot of speed and aren't afraid to send two or three forecheckers in an attempt to create offense that way. So the Pens will need to fare much better with their breakouts than they did Tuesday against the Flyers. If the Canadiens score a few goals that way and Price stands tall in this series, it could go the distance.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Good morning Matt when will we know who is starting in goal go pens <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Ryan, Mike Sullivan is supposed to talk to reporters in a little bit. There is a chance he will finally tell us who is in goal. He could also leave us hanging until pregame warmups tonight. It would be very surprising if it weren't Matt Murray. All signs point to that, including Murray getting the start against the Flyers instead of being the one coming in cold halfway through the exhibition game.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Hi Matt , watching that scrimmage gave me flash backs to all that was wrong in the NYI sweep last year , can the pens play the disciplined hockey style that made then so good earlier in the season ? <br> <strong>Guest</strong>: Was it just me or did the Philly look like the better team in that scrimmage ? The pens just looked not ready to play . Watching some of the other scrimmages made me not feel as confident in the pens readiness either . <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I'll lump these two questions together since they are along the same lines. But I agree that there were some worrisome moments against the Flyers, especially given the bigger picture. The Penguins had already started to slip prior to the pause. Then, after a long layoff, we saw some of the same issues during the camp scrimmages, things like bad decisions at both blue lines and careless plays with the puck. So when that stuff popped up again Tuesday, it definitely should sound alarm bells. There is such a talent gap between the Pens and the Habs that it might not matter if the Penguins continue to play like that. But they won't last much longer if that stuff continues.</p>
<p><strong>Dean</strong>: What do you think is a reason for the Pens powerplay to seem non existent? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: We have done a few stories on the power play over the past few weeks, so I would encourage you to search for those on the site to get more context and analysis than I can offer you here. But to sum it up, they don't have an ideal option in Phil Kessel's old spot, injuries took away top talent and continuity during the regular season, and now the players appear to be overthinking things due to a lack of confidence. I think the power play will have moments, but I don't know that it will click and dominate over a prolonged stretch.</p>
<p><strong>Ln</strong>: how confident are you that Letang can play a smart simple game and not try to do too much ? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I get the concern about Letang, whose cavalier style drives some fans and occasionally his coach crazy. But I think you just have to let him be who he is and live with the rough moments. You'd hope he would rein it in a little during the playoffs, especially after what happened against the Isles a year ago. But you do still want him to be assertive and making smart gambles, because when he uses his skating and instincts Letang is still a difference-maker, even at his age.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Did your son find his cheez its 😀 <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Haha! This is a reference to my 4-year-old making a cameo on a Zoom press conference with Kris Letang and Tristan Jarry this week. I asked Kris a question about the Montreal forecheck and my son darted into the kitchen to ask me for a snack. So that was interesting. Working from home remains a challenge due to anxious moments like that. But I've loved being able to spend so much time with my two little ones over the past few months. We've had a blast. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Any more questions this morning? Or can I go take my pregame nap? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Alright, nap it is! Enjoy Game 1 tonight and please check out all of our analysis after the game. We'll do another chat Monday morning in anticipation of Game 2. My editor might give me the hook in favor of Mike DeFabo, though. Either way, join us again Monday.</p>
