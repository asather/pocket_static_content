<h1>Skull Fest, the hardcore punk and metal festival, is canceled</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Add Skull Fest to the list of music festivals that won’t happen in 2020.</p>
<p>The 12th edition of the hardcore punk and metal festival was set for August in a handful of East End clubs.</p>
<p>Organizer Dusty Hanna, who plays in the band Killed by Death, decided now that it wasn’t worth the risk of trying to pull it off.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there will be able to be an event like Skull Fest by then — not something where people are literally on top of each other like that, sweating and all screaming into microphones together,” he says.&nbsp;“I could see there being some seated, more chill events going on possibly by August, maybe a social-distance-at-your-table-while-a-performer-plays type of scenario. And best of luck to people who will be hosting those types of events, but that isn’t the same type of thing we do.”</p>
<p>Skull Fest is known more for bands like Poison Idea, The Cro-Mags, Doom and Killer of Sheep that create lots of togetherness in the pit.</p>
<p>Skull Fest-goers won’t have to lament over who they’re missing — the festival had yet to announce the 2020 lineup.</p>
<p>“We have arranged to have most of the bands return to play next year’s fest,” Hanna says.&nbsp;“The lineup will be kept a secret until we announce April of 2021. However, to drop some hint of what next year’s lineup possibly will have, we are in negotiations with one of the all time greatest LA punk bands to fly out for a one-off gig for Skull Fest, as well as classic British punk bands and current groups from literally around the globe.”</p>
<p>On the plus side, the cancellation creates a rare opportunity for the organizers.</p>
<p>“We always joked that we should cancel Skull Fest and go to the beach,” Hanna says. “Now the coronavirus has made that joke/dream a reality. Social distancing beach parties only, of course.”</p>
<p>The Deutschtown Music Festival, Three Rivers Arts Festival and Metal Immortal Festival are among the music festivals that have already been canceled. The Millvale Music Festival, usually held in May, is currently slated for Aug. 8.</p>
