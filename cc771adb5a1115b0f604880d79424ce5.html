<h1>Pittsburgh's summer classical music lineup is all virtual</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s classical music organizations will remain online throughout the summer due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra typically dominates summers with a variety of indoor and outdoor concerts, while Pittsburgh Festival Opera, Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble and others perform for their devoted followers. This year, these organizations will offer&nbsp;a range of virtual programming for children and adults.</p>
<p><strong>Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra</strong></p>
<p>“Summer with the Symphony” kicks off Monday and continues with six weeks of free programming, including recordings from recent international tours and archival footage with world-renowned soloists like pianist Yuja Wang and Daniel Trifonov. Twenty-four PSO members also recorded a socially distanced performance in June at Hartwood Acres that will stream on the Allegheny County Parks Summer Concert Series on July 12 at 7 p.m. on <a href="https://cwpittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2014/05/21/wpcw-channel-locator/" target="_blank">the CW</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlleghenyCountyParks/" target="_blank">online</a> at 8 p.m. (The series broadcasts each Sunday at that time and features a variety of genres and bands; the full schedule is at <a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/special-events/summer-concert-series.aspx" target="_blank">alleghenycounty.us</a>.)</p>
<p>The symphony’s summer programming also includes a week of Christmas in July with a gingerbread building competition, a week of musical storytelling in partnership with the Allegheny County Librarian Association and a week to get to know the orchestra’s principal pops conductor, Byron Stripling.

<p><strong>Pittsburgh Festival Opera</strong></p>
<p>The city’s resident summer opera festival has also moved online and will offer concerts, masterclasses and behind-the-scenes looks. New artistic director Marianne Cornetti, a world-renowned opera singer, will deliver a festival opening performance on July 10. The company will present a variety of chamber concerts, including the BEO String Quartet, flutist Lindsey Goodman and young artists program director Robert Frankenberry.</p>
<p>“I, Too, Sing” will stream on July 17 and explores racial representation in classical music literature. A children’s adaptation of Dvorak’s opera&nbsp;“Rusalka,” based on a familiar tale about a mermaid and sea witch, streams on July 18. The festival concludes July 24 with the Online Young Artists Program. Information:&nbsp;<a href="https://pittsburghfestivalopera.org/" target="_blank">pittsburghfestivalopera.org</a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh</strong></p>
<p>The Mendelssohn Choir performs concerts with the PSO as well as independent programming throughout the year. This summer the organization is offering free weekly streaming events that combine professional vocal coaching sessions with lectures on choral music on Wednesday evenings. Artistic director Matthew Mehaffey will host the conversations, intended to explore issues of race and choral music in partnership with the Oratorio Society of Minnesota.

<p><strong>Pittsburgh New Music Festival</strong></p>
<p>PNME typically stages 10 concerts a year in July but suggested in a June Facebook post that it will not be presenting live concerts in 2020. Its website hadn’t been updated with details as of Friday afternoon.</p>
