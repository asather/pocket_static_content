<p>WASHINGTON — Hospitals, doctors and emergency responders in the Pittsburgh region are in desperate need of medical supplies and personal protective equipment to shield against COVID-19, coming up short on gloves, masks, gowns and eye protection, lawmakers said on Monday.</p>
<p>“We have firefighters responding to EMS calls with no masks and barely any medical-grade PPE,” said Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, who has been coordinating deliveries of medical supplies donated by school superintendents and labor unions in recent years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Allegheny County has coordinated these citizen-led efforts, “people need to understand that that is only a Band-Aid on a very severe problem,” Mr. Lamb said, estimating Western Pennsylvania will soon need millions of masks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This supply chain shortage is real, doctors and nurses and healthcare workers will get sick unnecessarily if we do not protect them,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb and other Democratic lawmakers have called on President Donald Trump to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/03/23/Washington-pandemic-COVID-19-coronavirus-war-defense-production-act-spending/stories/202003220046" target="_blank">invoke his wartime powers</a> to dramatically scale up production of medical supplies — actions Mr. Trump has not yet taken.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb said the situation on the ground is needlessly chaotic and inefficient, as local governments have been forced to hunt down supplies for their medical systems.</p>
<p>“The (federal) government could call up right now, and order billions of masks, and that would be an order of the size that would actually get these companies moving at a rate we need them at,” Mr. Lamb said.</p>
<p>“If instead you have 50 different governors, a hundred different county executives and fire chiefs calling them, all with little orders, calling them at different times, you’re just not going to get the response quickly enough,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb is leading a bipartisan push to establish a federal reimbursement program for local governments placing such orders.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://lamb.house.gov/sites/lamb.house.gov/files/2020%200322%20PPE%20Letter.pdf" target="_blank">letter sent to House leaders</a> on Sunday, Mr. Lamb wrote that local agencies are already behind and health workers are “being exposed to the virus everyday without enough protection.” The&nbsp;bipartisan letter — signed by 15 other lawmakers, including Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills and Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters — said that&nbsp;even if Mr. Trump decided to order companies to produce supplies, local agencies needed to purchase equipment immediately.</p>
<p>The goal is to “send a signal to someone like Rich Fitzgerald, that if you place an order now before things get bad in your town ... federal money will be there for you,” Mr. Lamb said.&nbsp;“The numbers of these things that we’re going to need is just astounding.”</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle, in an interview Monday, said Pittsburgh firefighters have called him in recent days to describe a lack of equipment.</p>
<p>“They’re on the front line of this, and they’re running low, almost out of equipment to protect themselves,” Mr. Doyle said. “Same with our health care workers.”</p>
<p>“I listen to the president every day saying how much equipment is being manufactured, but people on the front lines don’t seem to be seeing it,” Mr. Doyle said.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle said he’s concerned that, as local agencies across the country all put in orders for the same equipment, suppliers will raise prices.&nbsp;New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters on Sunday the price of masks has risen to $7 each from 85 cents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle said this is a time for federal coordination.</p>
<p>“The United States government should be the one entity that bids for all this equipment wherever they can locate it,” Mr. Doyle said. “And then make sure it gets distributed to the areas that need it.”</p>
<p>Right now, “It’s kind of willy-nilly,” he said.</p>

<p>As the dearth in medical supplies is exacerbating local COVID-19 response plans, Senate negotiations collapsed again on Monday. The Republican-controlled chamber could not agree on the details of a $1.8 trillion rescue bill, with Democrats rejecting the GOP’s proposal for a second time in two days.</p>
<p>Democrats on Monday sought to outline their demands for greater protections for workers and more accountability on how billions in loan money will be spent.</p>
<p>But the two sides appeared no closer to resolving the main sticking point: the nature of billions in emergency loans for companies.</p>
<p>Republicans have argued the loans are needed to keep companies solvent through the economic shock, while Democrats have labeled them “slush funds” because the aid does not have strong enough protections for workers.</p>
<p>“The Republican draft includes hundreds of billions in slush funds for corporate bailouts, but few protections for workers,”&nbsp;Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., <a href="https://twitter.com/SenBobCasey/status/1241818273055936512" target="_blank">wrote on Twitter.</a> “It has no limits on stock buybacks and allows companies to receive bailout funds even if they fire workers.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey outlined six key points he wants to see in the proposal, including an expansion of food stamp benefits, stronger student loan protections and automatic Medicaid eligibility.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey and Mr. Doyle have also signed onto a proposal to create a special enrollment period for Americans to sign up for health care under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., has been defending the credit lines on the Senate floor and on television networks in recent days. After&nbsp; predicting the Senate bill would pass on Sunday, Mr. Toomey said in a floor speech he was “shocked” the measure did not pass.</p>
<p>On Monday, he told CNBC’s&nbsp;“Squawk Box” program that the bulk of the $500 billion in emergency loans are available to fundamentally solvent businesses who need short-term cash to get through the crisis. He pointed out that all the money is required to be paid back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the House’s Democratic majority will begin assembling its own rescue plan, which will likely conflict with the Senate’s proposal.&nbsp;“I’m glad the Senate Democrats had the courage to fight for a better deal,” Mr. Doyle said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle said House Democrats will have a conference call on Tuesday to discuss next steps for the bill — including whether lawmakers will return to Washington or work remotely.</p>
<p>Two House members have tested positive for COVID-19, and Mr. Doyle said he would support remaining at a distance.</p>
<p>“I’m hopeful they figure out some way this can be done either remotely — or by unanimous consent if we reach an agreement — so that we don’t have to bring all those people back and possibly infect more people,” Mr. Doyle said.</p>
