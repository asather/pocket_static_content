<h1>Paul Zeise mailbag: Is Matt Murray worth what top goalies make?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat Steelers and more with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @PaulZeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>:&nbsp;Do you think Matt Murray will ever be the player he was back in 2016-2017? The fact that he reportedly wants 6-8 million a year on a new contract is ludicrous given his play the last few years.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Well, Jonathan Quick is the 10th highest paid goalie in the NHL. He will make $5.8 million this year. The Pens have to figure out if they think Murray is a top 10 goalie. I would think they will give him between $5 million and $6 million, but if they go much higher than that — unless he wins another Stanley Cup this year — it would be silly. Tristan Jarry has been the better of the two goalies this year. I am not saying they should let Murray go, but I don’t think he has the leverage he once did to try and get one of those deals like the top three or four goalies make. Murray is still a very good goalie, but I don’t think he merits a top five contract.</p>
<p><strong>The Whiz:</strong> OK, let me say it like this — can we please get Kris Letang the [heck] out of here? I cannot stand watching him take stupid penalties, give up odd man breaks with his dumb passes to nobody and turning the puck over. I keep hearing what a great player he is but that’s a lie. He stinks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> This question had to be sent right after that horrible penalty he took Tuesday against the Devils. Letang is a tough one to figure out. His ledger generally is tilted to the positives — in other words, all the good he does outweighs all the bad. He is still an elite level offensive defenseman. He still is, for the most part, effective on the power play. He is still one of the better defensemen in the NHL. But he plays stupid and selfish too often, he takes too many chances that lead to problems for the Penguins and he plays at time like a guy who doesn’t understand his primary role as a defenseman is preventing goals. He is really frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> What is your projected Pirates starting rotation? And who do you have as a surprise making the roster?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> My guess is Chris Archer will be the&nbsp;“ace”, i.e. the No. 1 starter. Trevor Williams will be the No. 2 starter, Joe Musgrove at the No. 3 slot, Mitch Keller at the No. 4 slot and Derek Holland will be the No. 5 starter. My guess is Holland will not survive the entire season. Archer will be traded before the deadline and we will see Steven Brault eventually make his way into the rotation. I would advise you not to buy your World Series ticket just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Joe N:</strong> ESPN is crazy if they think the Steelers would be interested in Jameis Winston. They don’t have the money for him and he throws too many interceptions. What did you make of this story?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong>&nbsp;I think the story was about which team is the best fit for each free agent quarterback. And the author suggested that Winston fit best in the Steelers offense. He compared his physical tools to those of a younger Ben Roethlisberger. You are correct they don’t have the money to sign him, but I don’t disagree with the premise: He is a perfect fit for the Steelers offense. The thing is, he is the best free agent quarterback on the market for my money. We aren’t talking about Tom Brady from five or six or ten years ago. He is aging and his skill set is diminishing. Winston is better than Philip Rivers; Ryan Tannehill and Teddy Bridgewater, too. He is going to be able to go get a big contract to be a starter somewhere. That, as much as anything, is why it won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>Nate:&nbsp;</strong>Do you think it's unfair that regular season champs in mid-major schools have to win their conference tournament in order to qualify for the Big Dance? Being great for 4 months should outweigh being great for 4 days.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> That is what conferences have decided. That isn’t an NCAA thing. The smaller conferences could decide to make their regular season champ the team that gets to go to the NCAA tournament. The problem is that it would suck a lot of the life and incentive out of the conference tournament. And the conference tournament is a money maker and gives smaller conferences publicity. And by having the winner get the automatic bid, it maximizes the interest and the intensity of it all.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Greg:</strong> Should Pitt accept a bid to the CBI if offered?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> No. It is an embarrassment that any team from the five major conferences and the Big East would ever consider that tournament. They should all leave it for the mid-majors and one-bid league teams that have had great years but didn’t make the NCAA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Paul — do you still think Pitt is better than Duquesne?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Yes. But I guess we will never know. So instead of continuing to badger me about the Dukes and how much you think I dis them, how about you sit back and enjoy their run over the next few days?</p>
