<h1>Pandemic pushes Pittsburgh Glass Works to close plant in Evansville, Ind.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Glass Works is shuttering its plant in Evansville, Ind., by the end of the year because of the severe downturn in the automotive industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The plant, which fabricates windshields as well as side and back windows for automobiles, employs 374 workers.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Glass Works, based on the North Shore, is owned by Mexican glass giant Vitro.</p>
<p>The company in April said it was downsizing a plant in Meadville, Crawford County, and cutting 108 jobs there effective June 10.</p>
<p>The Evansville plant had been closed for eight weeks because of the coronavirus and workers returned last week.&nbsp;They were told Friday the plant was slated for closure, according to published reports.</p>
<p>PGW said it was already working on a turnaround plan for the facility but the pandemic caused excess capacity and it didn’t see a path toward profitability.</p>

<p>“This is a very challenging time and a very difficult decision for our company,” Salvador Minarro, president of Vitro Automotive, said in a statement.</p>
<p>PGW in 2018 closed a plant in East Deer that was originally built as Pittsburgh Plate Glass’ first manufacturing site.</p>
