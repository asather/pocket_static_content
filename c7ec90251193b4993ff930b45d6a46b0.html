<h1>Port Authority board defends role overseeing agency rather than advocacy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>So what should be the role of board members at an agency such as Port Authority, to oversee and set policy for the $450 million operation of the region’s largest transit agency or advocate for public transportation?</p>
<p>Transit advocates pushed the authority board Friday to take a greater public role supporting transit, even accusing board member and state Rep. Lori Mizgorski, R-Shaler, of working against the agency by pushing a bill in Harrisburg to remove the Pennsylvania Turnpike’s obligation to pay $450 million a year for transit. Although by policy the board never responds to public comments during meetings, board Chairman Jeffrey Letwin defended the board’s role in general in an interview after the meeting and called Ms. Mizgorski’s bill an effort to provide sustainable funding for the authority.</p>
<p>The authority has 11 members, some appointed by the Allegheny County executive and others by the governor and state legislative leaders.</p>
<p>Dan Yablonsky, a spokesman for Pittsburghers for Public Transit, told the board at its monthly meeting that members need to take a larger public role advocating for transit improvements. He called it&nbsp;“almost comical” that members rarely speak out on transit issues and seldom do anything but cast votes during board meetings.</p>
<p>The advocacy group began a campaign with similar groups in Philadelphia and throughout the state in early May to maintain turnpike funding, which it said is crucial to keeping transit systems running across the state. The turnpike, which has more than $13 billion in debt, wants to eliminate or reduce the payments before 2023, when they are cut to $50 million a year.</p>
<p>Jay Ting Walker,&nbsp; a member of the Allegheny Transit Council, said board members should aggressively lobby for transit&nbsp;“instead of piling on,” which he accused Ms. Mizgorski of doing with her bill.</p>
<p>Rider Toni Haraldsen criticized other members for not speaking out against Ms. Mizgorski’s efforts.</p>
<p>“Why has the board remained quiet?” she asked.&nbsp;“The board has to remain united.”</p>
<p>Ms. Mizgorski, a member of the House Transportation Committee, couldn’t be reached to comment on the criticism. Previously she said her bill, similar to one proposed by Sen. Kim Ward, R-Hempfield, would alleviate financial pressure on the turnpike and provide another source for transit funds.</p>
<p>Mr. Letwin said he supports Ms. Mizgorski’s effort. He pointed out the turnpike has received permission to defer its $112.5 million payment due in July because of a revenue shortfall due to fewer riders paying tolls on the turnpike during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“The point being the turnpike isn’t the most sustainable source of funding,” he said.&nbsp;“Let’s get us out of relying on the turnpike and get a more sustainable source of funding.”</p>
<p>The chairman also said he’s comfortable with the role members play overseeing the agency and he doesn’t think “board members have [advocacy for transit] as part of their role.” The agency is “more efficient” using professional agencies to lobby for legislation on its behalf, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Letwin noted the criticism came one day after President Donald Trump announced the agency would receive a $99.95 million grant to help pay for the proposed Bus Rapid Transit system between Downtown Pittsburgh and Oakland.</p>
<p>“We’ve got our people who are working on our behalf,” Mr. Letwin said.&nbsp;“It’s hard to argue we should be doing something differently when we just landed a $100 million grant.”&nbsp;</p>
