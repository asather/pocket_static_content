<h1>Staying local: VisitPittsburgh's new president and CEO will feel right at home</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>VisitPittsburgh did not have to look far to find its new CEO.</p>
<p>After a national search, the tourism agency’s board decided to stay at home in naming Jerad Bachar as its new president and CEO Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Bachar has been serving as interim CEO since Craig Davis left in December to become CEO of VisitDallas.</p>
<p>“Jerad’s domestic and international tourism experience, as well as his familiarity with the Pittsburgh tourism sector and VisitPittsburgh, were major factors in our decision, and his exceptional leadership as interim CEO during these unprecedented times really made him stand out among our candidates,” said Bryan Iams, VisitPittsburgh board chairman.</p>
<p>Mr. Bachar is taking over at a tough time. The tourism industry and hotels have been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of conventions scheduled for Pittsburgh this year have canceled already, including the annual Furries gathering scheduled for July, and more could do so.</p>
<p>It will be his job to try to resuscitate tourism in Pittsburgh as the pandemic subsides. VisitPittsburgh had hired Searchwide Global in January to find a new CEO.</p>
<p>Mr. Bachar, who holds an MBA degree from the University of Liverpool, has been involved in tourism and economic development for more than 30 years. He was hired by VisitPittsburgh in January 2019, serving as executive vice president.</p>
<p>In that role, he oversaw Meet Pittsburgh, SportsPittsburgh, destination services, and partnership development and outreach. He had previously worked for the agency as national sales director from 2004 to 2008.</p>
<p>In the interim role, he has been active, Mr. Iams said in the announcement.</p>
<p>“Jerad has demonstrated his ability to collaborate with key stakeholders, to be forward-thinking as we plan our market rebound strategy and to be willing to make tough decisions for the benefit of our organization and the local tourism sector,” he said.</p>
<p>During his career, Mr. Bachar has served extensively in the Middle East.</p>
<p>He worked as an executive director for the Bahrain Economic Development Board and as a director for the Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing. He also served as a strategic advisor to the Saudi Commission for Tourism and Heritage, and the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority.</p>
