<h1>Virtual exhibitions? August Wilson Center and others show how to do it right</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Virtual tours of cultural and historic sites are nothing new, but they have taken on an added significance in the COVID-19 era.</p>
<p>They are not only the next best thing to being there. They are the only thing.</p>
<p>The August Wilson African American Cultural Center has created its <a href="https://aacc-awc.org/visit/galleries-spaces/" target="_blank">first virtual tours</a>&nbsp;featuring two photo exhibitions that opened in the center’s galleries shortly before the pandemic hit. Videos, with music and artist commentary, offer insights into <a href="https://aacc-awc.org/visit/galleries-spaces/" target="_blank">“Vanishing Black Bars &amp; Lounges: Photographs”</a> by L. Kasimu Harris and <a href="https://aacc-awc.org/visit/galleries-spaces/" target="_blank">“I came by Boat so Meet me at the Beach”</a> by Ayana&nbsp;M. Evans and Tsedaye Makonnen.</p>
<p>“These virtual tours get to the core of our mission to champion innovative young artists ... even at this time of social distancing,” said Janis Burley Wilson, president and CEO of the center. “The tour also serves as a cultural outlet for our patrons and, of course, provides access to a much larger constituency than can walk through our doors in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>In “Vanishing Black Bars &amp; Lounges,” a New Orleans-based photographer documents the black-owned social spaces that are disappearing throughout his Louisiana hometown. “I came by Boat so Meet me at the Beach” is a collaboration between Evans, a performance artist, and Makonnen, a multidisciplinary artist whose works explore&nbsp;“the intersection of womanhood and race in America through video and images.”</p>
<p>Social distancing has stalled work on “A Writer’s Landscape,” a permanent exhibition on the life of August Wilson that is scheduled to open in the fall.&nbsp;However, more digital content is on the way.</p>
<p>Starting April 27, on what would have been the playwright’s 75th birthday, the center is introducing “Last Mondays,” a monthly conversation series streaming on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AugustWilsonAfricanAmericanCulturalCenter/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. The first installment will feature actor-director Ruben Santiago-Hudson, poet jessica Care moore, scholar Sandra Shannon and actor Nathan James in conversation with artist Deesha Philyaw.</p>
