<h1>Felipe Vazquez, suspended Pirates pitcher, faces child porn charge in Missouri</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Suspended Pirates pitcher Felipe Vazquez was charged in St. Louis with giving pornographic material to a minor last summer, according to court records.</p>
<p>Mr. Vazquez, originally from Venezuela, was charged in February with furnishing pornographic material to a minor, a misdemeanor in Missouri.</p>
<p>Mr. Vazquez, 28, has been in the Westmoreland County Prison since September, after he was charged with sex crimes. In that case, Mr. Vazquez <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/09/18/felipe-vazquez-arrested-sex-charges-pirates-pitcher/stories/201909180128" target="_blank">admitted to having sexual contact</a> with a 13-year-old girl in August 2017, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>He was charged with statutory sex assault, a felony, 11 felony counts of unlawful contact with a minor, 10 felony counts of child pornography, two felony counts of corruption of a minor and a misdemeanor count of indecent assault of a person less than 16 years old.</p>
<p>Mr. Vazquez also faces charges in Florida involving the same alleged victim as the case in Westmoreland. According to those charges, Mr. Vazquez gave obscene material to and solicited sex with a minor, allegedly using a cellphone to exchange sexually explicit photos and a video.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball Commissioner’s Office immediately placed Mr. Vazquez — an All-Star pitcher for the Pirates in 2018 and 2019 — on administrative leave (and, as a result, restricted list) pursuant to the Joint MLB/MLBPA Policy shortly after his September arrest.</p>
