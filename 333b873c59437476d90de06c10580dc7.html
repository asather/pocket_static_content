<h1>High school boys basketball rankings: Top teams square off in Pittsburgh Basketball Club event</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>How would the top team in the City League fare against one of the best WPIAL Class 4A teams? The Pittsburgh Basketball Club Hall of Fame Classic will give the answer.</p>
<p>The annual event, put together by John Giammarco and the Pittsburgh Basketball Club, will be staged Sunday Montour High School. Five games will be played starting at noon.</p>
<p>The Hall of Fame Classic always features some matchups between top teams. This year is no different. Three of&nbsp;the games feature two teams that are in the Post-Gazette rankings. The 3 p.m. game should be interesting between Allderdice and Highlands. Allderdice is the six-time defending City League champion and ranked No. 1 in the City again this season. The Dragons knocked off Pine-Richland, a Class 6A team, last Saturday. Highlands, meanwhile, is the No. 3 team in Class 4A.</p>
<p>The day starts with Sto-Rox against Seton LaSalle at noon. At 1:30 p.m., Mars takes on Upper St. Clair. Mars is ranked No. 3 in Class 5A while Upper St. Clair is No. 5 in Class 6A.</p>
<p>After the Allderdice vs. Highlands contest, Ambridge meets Uniontown at 4:30 in another matchup between ranked teams. Uniontown is No. 2 in Class 4A while Ambridge is No. 4.</p>
<p>The final game at 6 p.m. matches Lincoln Park and Kennedy Catholic, two state champs from a year ago. Lincoln Park won the PIAA Class 3A championship last season, while Kennedy Catholic won Class 6A. Graduation took away most of Kennedy Catholicâ€™s players from last season and Kennedy Catholic also recently lost 6-foot-10 sophomore center Michael Moore, who is no longer at the school. He is now playing for Spire Institute in Geneva, Ohio.</p>
