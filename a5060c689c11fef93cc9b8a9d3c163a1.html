<h1>Better oversight: Jail needs scrutiny now more than ever </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Prisoners are being released from the Allegheny County Jail because of the pandemic, a jail employee and an inmate have tested positive for COVID-19 and now prisoners have filed a lawsuit demanding release for fear of infection.</p>
<p>Yet the Allegheny County Jail Oversight Board canceled its April meeting. This is not the time to cancel a meeting. Hold a virtual meeting, hold an in-person meeting with proper social distancing, do a conference call — cutting the meeting is pure irresponsibility.</p>
<p>The board needs to get back on track and schedule a meeting — now.</p>
<p>Canceling the meeting was the decision of board chairwoman Kim Berkeley Clark, president judge of the county Common Pleas Court. Judge Clark should know more than anyone the critical need at this moment for the oversight committee to function.</p>
<p>Not all members were on board with the cancellation. Allegheny County Controller Chelsa Wagner for one. The board must meet when inmates and employees are at their most vulnerable, Ms. Wagner said. The board provides an independent monitor of the jail, and the cancellation erodes public trust. Ms. Wagner is right.</p>
<p>The nine-member board provides a critical review function — critical when a series of rapid decisions is being made affecting inmates and staff. While Judge Clark said she wants the warden to be free to focus on the situation at the jail, those efforts could benefit from discussion with the oversight board. The board also provides a check on whether measures taken to combat COVID-19 line up with medical science and the rights of staff and inmates.</p>
<p>The board meets the first Tuesday of each month. Judge Clark says the board will meet in May, but the April meeting should be quickly rescheduled. There’s more than enough ground to cover and questions to be asked about health and safety precautions. What are the criteria, for instance, for release of prisoners? More than 700 people have been released from the jail in the past few weeks. Do they have a place to go, or are they simply put out on the street? Are they connected with resources they’ll need?</p>
<p>Those sorts of questions demand a functioning oversight board.</p>
