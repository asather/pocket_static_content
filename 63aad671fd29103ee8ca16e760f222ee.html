<h1>PNC, other big banks set to close early Friday in nod to Juneteenth</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Amid continuing racial unrest, a number of big banks across the country — including Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank — are closing offices and branches early on Friday in observance of the day known as Juneteenth. <strong><br></strong></p>
<p>The term commemorates June 19, 1865 — two months after the end of the Civil War — when Union troops reached Texas to enforce the end of slavery there.</p>
<p>“If there is anything the past few weeks in our country have revealed, it’s that we all need to do a better job of listening and trying to understand experiences that may not be our own,” PNC CEO William Demchak said in a statement. “Juneteenth is a significant piece of our nation’s history. Our observance is an opportunity to bolster important dialogue about the past and collectively work toward shaping a better future.”</p>
<p>PNC, the biggest bank in Pennsylvania, said it would close all office and branch locations at 2 p.m. local time on Friday. Drive-thru service has been open until 5 p.m. during the pandemic.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island-based Citizens Bank, the second-biggest retail bank in the Pittsburgh region, won’t be closing early on Friday but is giving employees three hours of paid volunteer time to contribute toward addressing systemic racism in the way they think best, spokesman Peter Lucht said.</p>
<p>Some other big banks closing early to recognize the day include New York-based JP Morgan Chase, U.S. Bank in Minneapolis, Capital One in McLean, Va., Dallas-based Comerica and Cincinnati’s Fifth Third.</p>
<p>A number of other businesses have announced closures and other plans to mark the day this year.</p>
