<h1>Workshop PGH in Garfield offers free mask and crafts DIY kits</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you’ve been wanting to make your own protective face masks but have had trouble finding the raw materials, look no further than Workshop PGH’s front window.</p>
<p>The Garfield<a href="https://workshoppgh.com/" target="_blank"> crafts store and do-it-yourself school</a> was forced to shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, putting a temporary end to in-person classes and moving the retail part of its business online. In the meantime, Workshop PGH is offering DIY mask and art kits that anyone can pick up for free outside its Penn Avenue storefront.</p>
<p>“We just had a lot of supplies when this first started,” owner Kelly Malone said. “I know personally that DIY is very therapeutic in making stuff.... I just decided to give them away for good cheer and to boost people’s morale.”</p>
<p>Batches of kits are taped to the store’s front window or laid out on the sill a few times a week. Workshop PGH’s social media accounts generally announce when new kits are available.</p>
<p>Ms. Malone said the business got a governor’s exemption to make masks, so she and her volunteers go in a few days a week to make the kits and sew masks that they hand out around the neighborhood.</p>
<p>“I can’t reasonably make masks for everyone out there, but I could put out the materials and show them how,” she said.</p>
<p>Workshop PGH has given out at least 1,200 kits so far. Ms. Malone has heard stories of children making fun things with the crafts materials and has received some thank-you notes, including from a woman who told her the kits “flipped her attitude one day when she hit bottom.”</p>
<p>She also saw an 80-year-old man wearing a homemade mask he sewed from a Workshop PGH kit.</p>
<p>Ms. Malone is mostly relying on donations of both money and mask materials to keep the business going. She said Workshop PGH hasn’t qualified for most loan programs, though it did receive a <a href="https://www.kiva.org/about/how" target="_blank">Kiva loan</a>.</p>
<p>Her family has also been directly affected by COVID-19. She can’t see her parents right now because they’re under a quarantine at a nursing home. Her uncle in Philadelphia tested positive for the disease and had to have a plasma transfusion Tuesday, she said.</p>
<p>“It’s hit me in every single way it possibly could. I just like to share that so maybe if one person reads it they may be like, ‘Oh crap, I should make a mask.’”</p>
<p>Thanks to her, they have the means to do so.</p>
