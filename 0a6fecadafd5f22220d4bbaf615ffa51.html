<h1>Toll road association: Federal money now will help it become part of recovery effort tomorrow</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Under normal circumstances, toll roads, bridges and tunnels have few problems covering their expenses and maintaining or expanding facilities based on revenue from customers.</p>
<p>But as it has with many other ways of life, the COVID-19 virus has turned normal on its ear by sharply reducing users fees that toll facilities were built on. As a result, many agencies have made substantial changes —&nbsp;the Pennsylvania Turnpike, for example, cut its capital budget by 25% — and all are watching how the economic recovery unfolds to see whether additional changes will be needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association has asked Congress for $9.2 billion to help its members to begin or resume dozens of postponed construction projects. But rather than pitching the funding as a bailout for the toll industry, the association said the federal government should look to association members as resources with projects available to put people back to work and spur the recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patrick Jones, the association’s executive director and CEO, told a national news briefing Thursday that “Congress could send a strong signal to consumers and investors”&nbsp;by earmarking stimulus money for toll agency projects. A series of executives from toll facilities across the country, including the turnpike’s Mark Compton, told how agencies are deferring projects as they adjust to lower traffic producing less revenue.</p>
<p>“Since the middle of March our members’ toll facilities have seen traffic and revenue declines of 50 to 90%,” Mr. Jones said.&nbsp;“Every toll facility is different and the effects on them of COVID-19 and the recovery from the pandemic will be unique to each facility.</p>
<p>“User-financed transportation is a proven and reliable means to help America recover, rebuild, and grow our way out of this crisis.”</p>
<p><strong>Pandemic cutbacks</strong></p>
<p>Across the country, stay-at-home orders due to the pandemic have ravaged revenue for toll agencies.</p>
<p>In Georgia, the&nbsp;State Road and Tollway Authority expects to lose 28% ($12.8 million) of its annual revenue from March to the end of its fiscal year on June 30 with traffic on its&nbsp;Georgia Express Lane System down as much as 82% in early April and continuing around 70% in early May. As a result, the agency submitted a budget request calling for a 14% spending reduction, froze salaries and is reviewing capital projects to determine which should be reduced in scope, delayed or suspended.</p>
<p>On E-470, the 47-mile toll road that rings Denver, traffic was down 32.1% in March, leading the authority that operates the highway to cut its general budget by 10%, its capital budget by 12% and delay projects for a year or more.</p>
<p>The Transportation Corridor Agencies, which operate toll roads in Orange County, Calif., saw revenue drop by 70 to 80%. It has rebounded a bit to be down 40 to 50% now, but the agency will cut its operating and capital budgets in half to about $70 million for the fiscal year beginning July 1.</p>
<p>New Jersey refinanced $259 million in revenue bonds to continue projects after traffic and revenue on the&nbsp;New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway dropped more than 61% in April.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Turnpike took more drastic steps two weeks ago when it announced that it would reduce its capital budget by about 25%, from $606 million to $459 million for the year beginning June 1. The agency also postponed adopting a budget for the new year after projections that it would lose $400 million to $500 million in revenue as a result of the pandemic, with traffic reaching a low of 64.1% below last year for the week of April 5 and revenue down a low of 53% for the week of April 12.</p>
<p>In all, the turnpike delayed $147 million of work on 22 projects, most of it design work for construction in future years. Four projects ready for construction, including repairing a bridge at the Monroeville interchange that was struck by a vehicle, tree removal and two projects in the eastern part of the state, were delayed.</p>
<p>The biggest project involved moving back by at least two years the design for installation of overhead gantries as part of the agency's program to move to cashless tolling by fall 2021. Cashless tolling will still happen, but the next step to create free-flowing traffic by replacing toll booths with gantries to read E-ZPass transponders or license plates at a cost of several hundred million dollars will be delayed.</p>
<p>Brad Heigel, the turnpike’s chief engineer, said in an interview last week that none of the delayed projects involved immediate safety needs. In some instances, such as a repaving project near Somerset scheduled this season, the agency pushed back bids by three months to move the project into the next budget year.</p>
<p>“These projects are there for a reason&nbsp;— we want to get them done&nbsp;— but they aren’t critical,” Mr. Heigel said.</p>
<p>The deferments put the turnpike’s capital budget at the lowest it has been in 10 years, “and that isn’t going to improve any time soon,” Mr. Heigel said. The agency is projecting another 12% cut in capital spending next year, but that depends on how much turnpike traffic rebounds.</p>
<p>Traffic was down by 51.9% and revenue by 45% for the week of May 3, the best since March 15.</p>
<p>“This pandemic has created a whole new crystal ball,” he said.&nbsp;“At this point, we’re not assuming we’re going to get everything back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If we don’t see increases, we’re going to have difficult decisions to make. It’s not a popular decision, but it’s what we’re faced with.”</p>
<p><strong>Help recovery</strong></p>
<p>Samuel Johnson, president of the tolling association and CEO of the&nbsp;Transportation Corridor Agencies in Orange County, said he’s not concerned about irreparable damage to toll agencies as a result of the revenue cutbacks from the virus.</p>
<p>“Our ability to thrive on self-reliance is great,” he told reporters Thursday.</p>
<p>But the revenue cuts will make it difficult for agencies to borrow money for projects once the pandemic ends, Mr. Johnson said. It would help the nation as a whole if Congress poured some recovery money into toll facilities.</p>
<p>“One of the first things we do [when financial problems occur] is defer projects,” he said.&nbsp;“That means we can’t help with the economic recovery.</p>
<p>“I hope the federal government looks at our industry as a way to bolster the economy and get everybody back to work.”&nbsp;</p>
