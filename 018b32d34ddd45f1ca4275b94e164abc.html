<p>“Did you hear the joke about the germ?</p>
<p>“Never mind, I don’t want to spread it.”</p>
<p>In the midst of a pandemic, Tess Carter and her family hope to raise a smile when people walk past their house on Miami Avenue in Mt. Lebanon. The material is grade school-level, but with small children inside, the aim is goofy fun, not “Saturday Night Live.”</p>
<p>Since early March, the Carters have posted a succession of play-on-words jokes in the front windows. Their house is across the street from Mt. Lebanon High School, so there’s a built-in audience via foot traffic.</p>
<p>“The first sign we put up was not a joke, just ‘Have a Great Day,’” said Mrs. Carter. She and husband Jesse have four kids: Pippa and Rex, who are in elementary school, pre-schooler Casper and Romy, a toddler.</p>
<p>One day, her sister, Nell Wilson of Mt. Lebanon, sent her the joke about the germ. It was next to be posted in the window.</p>
<p>“After that, it became kind of a game, finding [related] jokes,” she said. “We thought it was fun and it would make people laugh so we just kept doing it.”</p>
<p>The signs are done on individual pieces of printer paper.</p>
<p>“I could probably draw or paint them but the letters have to be so big and bold to be legible. With four kids, it was just easier to use my printer,” Mrs. Carter said.</p>
<p>Among the sentiments: “Spring Break 2020 in the HOUSE! (Literally)” and “Why did the clock get sick? It didn’t wash its hands!”</p>
<p>“One of the things we love about Mt. Lebanon is what an incredibly friendly, connected community it is,” she said. “We really missed being able to interact with our neighbors, to smile and say hi as we walked to school or the library or uptown.”</p>
<p>Noticing the stream of people walking, running or riding bikes past the house, the family was inspired to keep changing the jokes.&nbsp;As of this week, there is a new one up.</p>
<p>“Why is it called novel coronavirus?”</p>
<p>And then: “It’s a long story.”</p>
<p>Cue rim shot.</p>
