<h1>Pa. issues alert to health care providers as COVID-19 cases reach younger patients</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health announced Saturday it has issued <a title="Alert to health care providers" href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/HAN/2020-PAHAN-513-07-04-ALT-Changing%20Ep.pdf" target="_blank">an alert to health care providers</a> about the COVID-19 virus infecting younger victims and reported 813 additional cases.</p>
<p>The state also reported 17 new deaths attributed to the virus, bringing the statewide total to 6,897 since the pandemic arrived here in March.</p>
<p>Those new figures included 215 more virus cases in Allegheny County,&nbsp;the 12th day in a row the Allegheny County Health Department reported the number of cases in triple digits.</p>

<p>State officials said they issued the advisory because of “significant increases” in the number of cases involving people from 19 to 24 years old. Cases involving younger people across the state now outnumber cases for patients 50 and older, the department said in a news release.</p>
<p>“Specifically, these cases have been associated with travel to other affected&nbsp;parts of the country and social gatherings or social settings (e.g., parties, restaurants, bars),” the department’s alert said. “Additionally, the&nbsp;average age of patients with COVID-19 has been decreasing slightly, indicating an increase in the number of&nbsp;younger people being diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
<p>“[The department] is asking that clinicians who are evaluating patients for COVID-19 ask about recent travel (international&nbsp;and within the US), attendance at social gatherings or social settings (e.g., parties, restaurants, bars), and&nbsp;occupation.”</p>
<p>Statistics provided by the department show cases among patients 19 to 24 have grown in the southwestern part of the state from just over 5% in April to just over 26% in July; from nearly 5% in April to nearly 16% in the southeast; from nearly 6% to more than 16% in the northeast;&nbsp; from 7% to more than 12% in the northwest; from nearly 8% to 12% in the north central; and from just over 7% to nearly 13% in the south central.</p>
<p>The new cases locally include six new hospitalizations and one new death, raising the overall totals to&nbsp;4,762 cases and 198 total deaths. Saturday’s figures came from 1,953 results of tests taken between July 1 and July 10.</p>
<p>The county reported that the newest cases range in age from one month to 86 years old with the median age being 33. That continues the trend of growing cases among younger people that led to the county restoring restrictions Friday against dining indoors at restaurants and gathering in large groups.</p>
<p>Concordia at Villa St. Joseph, a&nbsp;nursing home in Beaver County, reported Saturday that five residents tested positive for the virus. Those residents are in isolation, and the facility’s officials have investigated who they may have come into contact with. The state on Saturday reported 14 new cases in Beaver County.</p>
