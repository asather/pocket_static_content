<h1>Pa. AG: Two gas pipeline companies charged with polluting Washington County waterway</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two more shale gas development companies have been charged with environmental crimes in Washington County following a two-year, state grand jury investigation, State Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The attorney general formally charged National Fuel Gas Supply Corp., and its subcontractor, Southeast Directional Drilling, for polluting a tributary of St. Patrick Run and ground water near Route 22 in Bulger.</p>
<p>According to the attorney general’s office news release, and based on testimony before the 45th Investigating Statewide Grand Jury, a drilling fluid leak was discovered during a transmission pipeline replacement project in June 2015, but the subcontractor ignored it.</p>
<p>Employees of the subcontractor testified that their supervisors told them to “[pretend] they didn’t see it, more or less.” Employees also testified that when these spills occurred on other sites, “it is common within the industry to ‘look the other way’ ” and not report the incidents.</p>
<p>According to the AG press release, they were directed to hide the leaks from the project’s daily reports which lead to the contamination of surface and ground water in the area.</p>
<p>A Washington County resident testified that, on the day the drilling fluid leaked, the creek that ran through his property turned grey and cloudy.</p>
<p>“He was forced to shut off his only source of drinking water in an effort to prevent the contaminants in the creek from entering his water well,” according to the AG news release. “He still cannot use the drinking water well on his property.”</p>
<p>National Fuel Gas was charged with two counts of discharging industrial waste and two counts of discharging other pollutants, and one count of unlawful conduct, all in violation of the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law.</p>
<p>Southeast Directional Drilling was charged with 2 counts of discharging industrial waste and one count of unlawful conduct.</p>
<p>“I made a commitment to Pennsylvanians that I would protect their constitutional right to clean air and pure water. These companies turned a blind eye to that right and will be held accountable,” Mr. Shapiro stated in the release.</p>
<p>In June, based on testimony before the grand jury, Mr. Shapiro announced that Range Resources, one of the biggest shale gas development companies in the state, had pleaded no contest to criminal charges it “knowingly covered up” leaks at its Yeager well pad in Amwell Township, and at the Brownlee drilling site in Buffalo Township, both in Washington County.</p>
<p>Also as a result of the grand jury probe, Mr. Shapiro last month charged Cabot Oil and Gas with environmental violations for allowing methane gas to seep from poorly constructed shale gas wells into the ground water supplying residents of Dimock Township in Susquehanna County.</p>
<p>“​For decades, Pennsylvanians saw the health consequences and environmental devastation that came with unchecked corporate greed, and passed laws to prioritize people over big investors,” Mr. Shapiro stated. “We should expand those laws, but today we’re doing all we can to protect the public and hold these companies accountable for impairing our water.”</p>
