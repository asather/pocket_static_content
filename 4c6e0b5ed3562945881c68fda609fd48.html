<h1>Greg Toney resigns as Freedom football coach</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just one week into the 2020 season, Greg Toney is out as football coach at Freedom. And the circumstances surrounding his ouster are a bit murky.</p>
<p>Toney’s resignation stems from a team meeting held on Monday during which players took a vote on whether or not Toney should remain head coach for the remainder of the season, <a href="https://www.timesonline.com/story/sports/high-school/football/2020/09/15/greg-toney-resigns-freedoms-football-coach/5806833002/" target="_blank">according to the Beaver County Times</a>.&nbsp;The report said 15 players voted to get rid of Toney, while 12 voted for him to stay, and Toney immediately gathered his belongings and left the school after being informed of the results.</p>
<p>The Freedom Area School District, however, disputed details of that report Thursday, saying it “provided an inaccurate and incomplete representation of the details surrounding Mr. Toney’s resignation.”</p>
<p>“We will continue our practice of refraining from commenting on personnel matters such as this,” the school district’s statement read. “The circumstances of Mr. Toney’s resignation will be fully reviewed and addressed, as appropriate and necessary. At this time, the district’s focus is on our student-athletes and allowing them to continue their football season uninterrupted.”</p>
<p>Attempts to reach Freedom athletic director John Rosa on Thursday were unsuccessful. Toney declined to reveal whether or not players took a vote on his job status, or who initiated the vote. But he did offer a statement on the situation.</p>
<p>“I did not want to have my situation aired publicly and I did not want my family to have to deal with this, nor the team left in Freedom,” Toney said in a text message to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “I appreciate people who were loyal to me and felt the need to come to my defense, but I was not looking for defenders. I coached to the best of my ability and always made decisions based on what I felt was in the best interest of Freedom football. What’s done is done. Let the kids finish their season.”</p>
<p>Toney’s resignation comes on the heels of the Bulldogs’ 24-6 loss against New Brighton in their season opener Friday night. It was Freedom’s first home loss in 13 games since the opening of its new stadium.</p>
<p>The Beaver County Times report stated that five of his seven assistants also resigned, and at the Freedom Area school board meeting Thursday night, Rosa was approved as the interim head coach, along with five interim assistant coaches, one of whom was already on staff as a volunter coach.</p>
<p>Rosa will take over as interim head coach Friday against Riverside, according to Freedom Area superintendent Jeffrey Fuller. This would mark the second time in three years Rosa has stepped in on an interim basis, having led the Bulldogs to an 8-1 mark in 2018 after Russ Barley’s resignation.</p>
<p>Freedom (0-1) is coming off an 8-4 season in 2019 in Toney’s first year as head coach. The Bulldogs began Toney’s tenure with seven consecutive wins before dropping five of their final six games under his watch.</p>
