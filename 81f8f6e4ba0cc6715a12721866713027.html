<h1>Steelers bring back safety Jordan Dangerfield on a one-year deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers signed veteran safety Jordan Dangerfield to a one-year contract Friday morning.</p>
<p>Dangerfield has played in 46 games for the Steelers since joining the team as an undrafted free agent in 2014. He has three career starts â€” two in 2016 and one in 2018.</p>
<p>Dangerfield, who was not given a restricted free agent tender, is one of only two reserve safeties with any NFL experience currently on the 90-man roster. The other is Marcus Allen.</p>
<p>Safety is a position of need for the Steelers this offseason, although two of their corners are versatile enough to drop back and play if needed. Slot corner Mike Hilton played safety on occasion last season and Cameron Sutton has done it in the past, too.</p>
<p>Dangerfield, who had 13 tackles and a forced fumble last season, dressed for all 16 games because of his work on special teams.</p>
