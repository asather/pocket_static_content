<p>Penn State added defensive lineman Rodney McGraw, a three-star recruit according to Rivals, to its 2021 recruiting class on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-5, 233-pound lineman from Elkhart, Ind., initially signed with Indiana. McGraw announced his change of heart on Twitter.</p>
<p>"I want to thank Coach (Tom) Allen and Indiana University for the opportunity. Recent events have led me to re-evaluate my opportunities and take a closer look at some great programs," McGraw said in his Tweet. "The best choice for me is clear. I'm officially committed to Penn State."</p>
<p>McGraw is the 11th person to commit to the 2021 class at Penn State. Illinois, Purdue, Michigan, and Michigan State also gave offers to McGraw.</p>
