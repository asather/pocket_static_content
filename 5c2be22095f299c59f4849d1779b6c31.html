<p>The COVID-19 death toll and case count continued to grow both statewide and in Western Pennsylvania, according to figures released Friday.</p>
<p>Most of the seven new deaths reported in the region were in <strong>Allegheny County</strong>, whose total number rose by five to 99 deaths. Two additional deaths were reported in <strong>Beaver County</strong>.&nbsp;All of the new deaths were residents at nursing homes.</p>
<p>The new figures bring Allegheny County’s total number of cases to 1,319 cases — 1,272 confirmed and 47 probable —&nbsp;representing a 30-case jump from the previous day.

<p><strong>Pennsylvania</strong> health officials on Friday said there were 62 new COVID-19 deaths and 1,208 new cases reported in the previous 24 hours. Statewide, there have been a total of 2,354 deaths and 46,971 cases — confirmed and probable, according to the latest figures.</p>
