<h1>Pa. National Guard to arrive in Westmoreland nursing home Sunday morning</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania National Guard is scheduled to arrive at the Westmoreland Manor nursing home early Sunday morning after the county requested assistance earlier this week to stem a COVID-19 outbreak at its facility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six members of the guard will arrive at 6 a.m. Sunday to assist with the county-owned nursing home to help administer COVID-19 tests to staff and residents, according to a press release sent on Saturday by the Office of Westmoreland County Commissioners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a letter was posted onto the facility’s website by administrator Angela Knauff detailing the need for more assistance from the guard.</p>
<p>“The Pennsylvania National Guard will be able to perform testing that provides a faster turnaround time. This will also allow the managers at the Manor to focus on infection control and resident care,” the letter read.</p>
<p>The nursing home also has requested assistance with personal protective equipment supplies. The Manor currently uses 8,400 gowns per day, Saturday’s statement said.</p>
<p>The nursing home’s latest testing revealed no additional positive residents, the statement read. Two additional employees and an additional contracted staff member tested positive, the statement said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All positive employees are quarantining at home.</p>
<p>In addition to the National Guard’s assistance, the Westmoreland Manor has paused face-to-face visitation, as part of its phased reopening plan. Window visits will be permitted on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;</p>
