<h1>Teachers unions sue Gov. DeSantis over order pushing Florida schools to fully reopen</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Teachers unions sued Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday over his emergency order pushing schools to fully reopen next month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/us/coronavirus-florida-elderly.html" rel="nofollow">even as coronavirus cases in the state</a> are surging.</p>
<p>The suit, which appears to be the first of its kind across the country, sets up a confrontation between unions and politicians that could change the trajectory of school reopening over the coming weeks. In other parts of the country, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html" rel="nofollow">including California</a> and parts of Texas, many large school districts have concluded in recent days that it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html" rel="nofollow">not safe to hold in-person classes</a>. But DeSantis, a Republican, has been pushing for things to be different in Florida, which is home to five of the country’s 10 largest districts.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, DeSantis’ administration ordered schools across the state to reopen five days a week starting in August. His edict came as President Donald Trump called for schools to reopen nationwide and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/trump-schools-reopening.html" rel="nofollow">threatened to cut federal funding</a> for districts that did not teach in person.</p>
<p>The American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s largest teachers union, and its local affiliate, the Florida Education Association, accused DeSantis of violating a Florida law requiring that schools be “safe” and “secure.” The unions, along with parent and teacher plaintiffs, asked a state court in Miami to block the governor’s reopening order and allow local school superintendents and health departments to have full control over reopening decisions.</p>
<p>DeSantis’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>On Monday, Florida became the eighth state where at least 5,000 people with the virus have died after it added a daily tally of 90 deaths. The state also added 10,347 cases.</p>
<p>Public health experts have said districts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html" rel="nofollow">should consider reopening only</a> if they are in a region with a positive test rate at or below 5%. Miami-Dade County has recently reported positivity rates more than four times greater than that threshold, and the plaintiffs argue that it would be among the most dangerous places in the state to reopen schools.</p>
<p>Some local superintendents are skeptical that it will be safe to reopen so soon. “This is literally like sending people into battle, and without appropriate tools,” Robert Runcie, the superintendent of Broward County schools, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html" rel="nofollow">said last week</a> when recommending that his district teach online despite the governor’s order.</p>
<p>The unions will argue that no public school district in the state should reopen as scheduled next month. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said she was frustrated that DeSantis did not follow the governors of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/us/california-schools-reopening-newsom.html" rel="nofollow">hard-hit California and Texas</a>, who have said in recent days that schools can open remotely.</p>
<p>“It’s as if he is in this intense denial that his state is terribly at risk,” Weingarten said.</p>
<p>State Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran shot back that the Florida Education Association did not seem to have read or understand his emergency order, and that even before it, state law required schools to operate for 180 days a year, which amounts to five days a week.</p>
<p>“This E.O. did not order any new directives regarding the requirements of schools to be open, it simply created new innovative options for families to have the CHOICE to decide what works best for the health and safety of their student and family,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>What to do about schooling has long been one of the thorniest dilemmas posed by the coronavirus - in part because the science about how the disease spreads among children, and from children to adults, is not yet developed enough to draw firm conclusions. After Trump tweeted two weeks ago that schools “must” open in the fall, the issue has often been consumed by partisan bickering.</p>
<p>Public health experts agree that children are generally less likely to get infected than adults, and they tend to develop milder symptoms. But children are not immune and a small number have died.</p>
<p>“They get the disease, and they do transmit,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “The question is how much, and does that enhance transmission in the community?”</p>
<p>The data on that is mixed.</p>
<p>William Raszka Jr., a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at the University of Vermont Medical Center, said some countries have reopened their schools without new outbreaks, while others have had problems. Of great importance, he said, is the level of spread in the community outside the school.</p>
<p>Places such as Vermont, which have relatively few cases, might be able to open up more easily than places such as Arizona or Florida, which are seeing cases spike, Raszka said. He said high school and colleges might also have more trouble than elementary schools, as older children seem to be more acutely affected.</p>
<p>“Is that risk zero? No. We can’t develop a strategy that has zero risk,” Raszka said. “But we can develop strategies that minimize that risk.”</p>
<p>In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” Trump made clear that he favors face-to-face instruction and threatened to withhold federal funding from districts that do not offer that.</p>
<p>“I do say this - schools have to open,” he told host Chris Wallace. “Young people have to go to school, and there’s problems when you don’t go to school, too. And there’s going to be a funding problem because we’re not going to fund - when they don’t open their schools.”</p>
