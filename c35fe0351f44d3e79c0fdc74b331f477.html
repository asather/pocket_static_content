<h1>Accused Wilkinsburg shooter, alleged target, face each other in courtroom</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For 15 minutes Tuesday morning, the man charged with a 2016 mass murder in Wilkinsburg and his alleged target faced each other in a courtroom.</p>
<p>Cheron Shelton, the 33-year-old defendant, dressed in a cobalt blue suit, listened as Lamont Powell, wearing a gray, striped jailhouse jumpsuit, took the witness stand and described being shot in the back, hand, neck and chest on the night of March 9, 2016.</p>
<p>As the second day of Shelton’s homicide trial continued in the Allegheny County Courthouse,&nbsp;Powell described how he was manning the grill at his sister Brittany Powell’s rental house at 1304 Franklin Ave. on the unseasonably warm night before the gunfire started.</p>
<p>Powell’s brother, Jerry Shelton was there. Another sister, Chanetta Powell, who was eight months pregnant, had arrived. And cousins Tina Shelton and Shada Mahone were there, too.</p>
<p>All five Powell relatives died, along with Chanetta Powell’s unborn child. Neither Jerry nor Tina Shelton are related to the defendant.</p>
<p>“It was one of the first nice days that year. Me and my sister decided to have a cookout. She asked me to cook the meat,” Powell recalled. “I honestly just remember cooking the food and then hearing shots and basically ducking and laying on the ground.”</p>
<p>Of all the victims, the Powell intrigued investigators the most. They believe he was the impetus for the backyard massacre, alleging that Shelton targeted him because he thought that Powell had killed his best friend, Calvin Doswell, in 2013. Powell grew up in Homewood, and Shelton’s attorney, Randall McKinney, indicated during cross-examination that another of Powell’s sisters lived on Nolan Court in Homewood next to Shelton’s mother.</p>
<p>For nearly four years, Powell refused to cooperate with detectives on the case. He was arrested last month on a material witness warrant.</p>
<p>“I just didn’t want to relive that night,” Powell testified.&nbsp;“It’s a nightmare. I take care of family things in house. I didn’t want to relieve it in the open.”</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney Lisa Pellegrini asked Powell if he knew Doswell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I heard of him,” Powell responded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She asked what people had been saying about Doswell’s murder.</p>
<p>“They said I had something to do with it.”</p>
<p>Did you, Ms. Pellegrini asked.</p>
<p>“No ma’am.”</p>
<p>Asked on cross-examination by Mr. McKinney,&nbsp;“How did it feel when you were accused of a murder you didn’t commit,” Powell replied:&nbsp;“Horrible.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors focused on a Facebook post made that day by Brittany Powell about the cookout that said where the barbecue was happening.</p>
<p>Detectives said Shelton and Robert Thomas — <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/02/03/judge-Borkowski-drops-case-against-robert-thomas-wilkinsburg-mass-shooting/stories/202002030068?cid=search" target="_blank">a former co-defendant whose charges were dismissed Monday</a> by Judge Edward J. Borkowski for insufficient evidence and who was released Tuesday from the Allegheny County Jail —&nbsp;were alerted to a Facebook post that noted that Lamont Powell would be at the cookout.</p>
<p>Powell said he did not remember a picture of him at the grill being posted. But that testimony was contradicted by the next witness, his uncle David Shelton, who testified that Brittany Powell had posted live video on Facebook from Franklin Avenue that showed Lamont.</p>
<p>“He was at the grill area,” David Shelton said.&nbsp;“She got him on the grill enjoying himself.”</p>
<p>David Shelton said he was not related to the defendant.</p>
<p>Powell and Mr. Shelton were two of five witnesses who testified before the lunch break. Earlier, Allegheny County police homicide Sgt. Todd Dolfi wrapped up testimony about evidence recovered from the scene.</p>
<p>Thomas Morgan, a scientist with the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office walked the jury through spent shell casings and bullet fragments that were logged into evidence.</p>
<p>And the prosecution ended the morning session with witness Julie Knapp, who owns the Franklin Avenue property where the shootings happened and split her time living there with Brittany Powell and in Squirrel Hill with her ex-husband.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Knapp said she was happy to have a renter like Brittany Powell and her 7-year-old daughter, who had moved in the previous fall. Ms. Powell was best friends with the next-door neighbor, according to Ms. Knapp, and she was exactly the kind of tenant Ms. Knapp had been seeking.</p>
<p>“I wanted to know that there was a family, people with children around,” Ms. Knapp said, adding that she and Ms. Powell got to know each other.&nbsp;“We had a rapport.”</p>
<p>Ms. Knapp said she would give Ms. Powell’s daughter rides to school and on the day of the shooting had taken her to a job interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It went very well. It was just a wonderful day,” recalled Ms. Knapp, who struggled with her emotions.</p>
<p>They stopped by to pick up some items for the cookout, and the mood was jovial, with people coming and going.</p>
<p>“It was happy. Brittany had told me that day, she said,&nbsp;‘I feel safe here.’ She said,&nbsp;‘I feel safe raising a child here, and my family is coming back together again.’&nbsp;“</p>
<p>At some point before the gunfire, Ms. Knapp left the party to go to Squirrel Hill because her ex-husband was in China and something at the home needed to be fixed.</p>
<p>“Actually,” Ms. Knapp said,&nbsp;“it saved my life, I think.”</p>
