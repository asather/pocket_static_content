<h1>UPMC Maryland affiliation finalized</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>UPMC’s growing network has added a new member — Western Maryland Health System in Cumberland is now UPMC Western Maryland, cementing a formal relationship that began with a 2018 clinical affiliation.&nbsp;Boards for both organizations then signed a non-binding letter of intent to negotiate an affiliation agreement last March.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, finalized Feb. 1, UPMC “has committed to make certain capital investments to enhance services and upgrade facilities in the Western Maryland region,” according to a release. The statement did not specify what those investments would be or how much they would cost.</p>
<p>The reconfigured board at UPMC Western Maryland will comprise eight directors appointed by the current WMHS board and four designated by UPMC. The hospital has 201 licensed beds and employs 2,300 staff.</p>
<p>The release noted that the affiliation will not affect patients’ insurance coverage as it will honor the insurer contracts currently in place.</p>
