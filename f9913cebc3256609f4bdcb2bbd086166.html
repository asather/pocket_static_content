<p>An elderly couple were killed Sunday when a fire tore through their Rostraver home.</p>
<p>The two-alarm fire was reported around 2 a.m. at 808 Collinsburg Rd., and is under investigation by the state fire marshal.</p>
<p>The Westmoreland County Coroner’s office identified the victims as Marie Oblak, 81, and Lloyd Oblak, 83.</p>
<p>A dog also was killed in the blaze.</p>
<p>The victims’ son is a volunteer with the fire company, said Frank Backstrom, president of the Collinsburg Fire Company.</p>
<p>Fire Chief Chris Hoffman said there was no chance of rescuing the victims.</p>
<p>According to the coroner’s report, neighbors contacted 911 and the fire was fully involved when local fire companies responded.</p>
<p>The victims, who were pronounced dead at the scene, were found inside the split-level home, said Mr. Backstrom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cause of the fire is unknown.</p>
<p>Mr. Backstrom said it was the first fatal fire in the small community&nbsp;“in a long time.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>McCauley Funeral Home, West Newton, is handling arrangements for the couple.&nbsp;</p>
