<h1>Pennsylvania publishes data on coronavirus cases by ZIP code</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health is now including an <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx" target="_blank">interactive map of coronavirus cases searchable by&nbsp;ZIP code</a> as part of its online dashboard of specific information on the virus throughout the state.</p>
<p>State health officials began <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx" target="_blank">posting the&nbsp;interactive map</a> on Monday to show the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the number of negative virus tests.</p>
<p>The map is searchable by county and ZIP code. The health department also includes a mobile version of the information that can be viewed as a clickable county or ZIP code-level map</p>
<p>Health Secretary Rachel Levine said even residents in communities with a relatively low number of confirmed cases should continue to heed social distancing rules, noting a lack of widespread testing means the actual number of people with the virus is far higher than what shows up in the statistics.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s COVID-19 death toll rose by 360 to 1,564, the state health department reported Tuesday, with nearly 1,300 additional people testing positive for the virus. The coronavirus has sickened more than 34,500 people. The virus has been spreading faster in recent days in less populated counties like Columbia, Northumberland, Juniata and Susquehanna.</p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said&nbsp;he is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/04/20/Pennsylvania-Tom-Wolf-extends-stay-at-home-order-May-8-curbside-liquor-pick-up/stories/202004200096" target="_blank">extending the statewide stay-at-home order</a> until least May 8 but said the state may begin gradually reopening some businesses in early May.&nbsp;Republicans are pushing a more aggressive timetable.</p>
<p>“We are taking small steps toward regaining a degree of normalcy in Pennsylvania,” Mr. Wolf said Monday, though he cautioned, “This is not going to be resuming operations as they were in February.”</p>
<p>For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a couple of weeks. Older adults and people with existing health problems are at higher risk of more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.</p>
