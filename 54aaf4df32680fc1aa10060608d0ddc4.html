<h1>Biden, Trump score presidential primary victories in Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania held a primary election Tuesday amid civil unrest, a pandemic, the introduction of new voting machines in some counties and the debut of mail-in balloting that pushed county election bureaus to their limits.</p>
<p>The result of the highest-profile contest on the ballot was a foregone conclusion: President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, uncontested for their party’s nominations, both won their primary.</p>
<p>With no real competition, Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump easily won their respective primary elections in Indiana, Rhode Island, Maryland, New Mexico and Montana. Mr. Biden also won South Dakota.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Mr. Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination.</p>
<p>If he doesn’t secure the 1,911 needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month with primaries in West Virginia and Georgia.</p>
<p>The lack of drama in the outcome of the presidential primary and the huge number of voters who opted to vote by mail meant turnout was light.</p>
<p>Still, voters in some places were dealing with late-arriving mail-in ballots and a dramatic consolidation of polling places in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Montgomery County to cope with the difficulty of recruiting poll workers fearful of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Ultimately, more than 1.8 million voters applied for a mail-in or absentee ballot, smashing expectations by state officials for the debut of the state’s new vote-by-mail law and drawing warnings that many contest results will be delayed well past election night.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Biden mounted one of his most aggressive attacks against Mr. Trump, deriding the commander in chief’s disregard of core constitutional values and blistering him for being “more interested in power than in principle.”</p>
<p>“He thinks division helps him,” Mr. Biden said in a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall. “This narcissism has become more important than the nation’s well-being.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Mr. Trump could briefly pose with a Bible in front of nearby St. John’s Church.</p>
<p>“If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,” Mr. Biden said as he chided authorities for using “tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump “might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”</p>
<p>Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway denied that the president directed authorities’ actions to move back the protesters and bristled at suggestions the church visit was merely a photo op. She countered that Mr. Biden and other critics had no basis to second-guess what was in the president’s heart and his intentions.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Biden’s address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for more than two months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Mr. Trump and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention.</p>
<p>It was the third consecutive day that Mr. Biden made a public appearance and the first time he’s been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden spoke as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd’s death has spread around the country. While Mr. Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up.</p>
<p>He spoke of the “tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.”</p>
<p>“The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,” he said.</p>
<p>Since the early days of his candidacy, Mr. Biden has framed the election as a “battle for the soul of the nation.” He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves.</p>
<p>“I ask every American to look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are?” he said. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?”</p>
<p>The tone was part of Mr. Biden’s effort to cast himself as a “consoler in chief” in stark contrast to Trump’s blunt, confrontational style. While he noted that his anguish over the death of his son Beau five years ago from cancer isn’t the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief.</p>
<p>“Like many of you, I know what it’s like to grieve,” Mr. Biden said. “I know what it feels like when you’re thinking you can’t go on.”</p>
