<h1>In a restaurant industry disrupted by a pandemic, Allegheny County's health inspectors turn the focus to safety procedures</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Empty dining rooms aren’t the only oddity that area restaurants are facing in the age of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Since the state limited restaurants to takeout and delivery some five weeks ago, routine inspections of restaurant kitchens in Allegheny County have been on hold as food inspectors concentrate on making sure coronavirus-related safety protocols are being followed.</p>
<p>“We need to focus on what is most important,” said Donna Scharding, food safety program manager for the Allegheny County Health Department. “Public and workforce health is paramount,” she said. “None of us have been through a pandemic like this before, and people need a lot of guidance.”</p>
<p>For now, that means restaurants offering takeout, delivery or drive-through service aren’t being monitored for things such as temperature control and pest infestations.</p>
<p>Just like in normal times, restaurants still are responsible for minding their own kitchens, Ms. Scharding said. The county health code requires that at least one employee specially trained in safe food handling be on site during operating hours to oversee safe practices.</p>
<p>These days, the county’s 21 food safety inspectors have been spending most of their time on the phone helping restaurants and other food facilities that are still open protect their customers and employees from catching the virus. Besides restaurants, the department inspects kitchens in grocery stores, convenience stores, banquet halls, social clubs, schools and hospitals in addition to food processors and food warehouses, among others.</p>
<p>“The most important thing is that no one is working when they are sick,” Ms. Scharding said. “If someone is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, managers need to know what to do.”</p>
<p>The department also wants to make sure restaurants enforce frequent hand-washing for employees, and are doing extra cleaning and disinfecting, including at the register and in public waiting areas that might be overlooked.</p>
<p>More recently, inspectors also have been emphasizing the state’s mandate that workers and customers wear masks, and sharing ways to practice social distancing, she said.</p>
<p>A small group of inspectors, “who are comfortable going out,” continue to do on-site visits in special cases, such as inspecting new facilities and following up on complaints from the public, Ms. Scharding said.</p>
<p>Recently, most complaints have involved employees not wearing masks or not staying six feet apart, she said. There also have been “two or three” complaints about dining rooms being open against the governor’s orders. After being contacted by the department, those businesses complied and shut down, she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Scharding said the department has been following special operating guidelines issued by the Food and Drug Administration and national organizations for city and county health officials during the crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While regular on-site visits are on hold, at least one health department — in Greenville, S.C. — has&nbsp;turned to&nbsp;“virtual” inspections, in which restaurant managers walk inspectors through the facility via video.</p>
<p>Ms. Scharding called the idea “interesting,” but said the county has no plans to conduct remote inspections.&nbsp;“We are relying on the directives from the governor so we can gauge when we can do [routine] food safety inspections” again, she said.</p>
<p>Locally, one upside of the lockdown has been more time for inspectors to research business names on state websites to help identify restaurants and catering businesses operating under the radar without a health permit.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, some two dozen operators without permits have been ordered to close, including Bethie Bakery in Plum, Marquez Family Bakery in Bridgeville and 7-Senses Catering in Homewood.</p>
<p>The county doesn’t have solid numbers on how many restaurants in the region remain open for takeout and delivery. So far, the health department has confirmed that 730 of the roughly 4,200 restaurants in the county have shut down completely, but it hasn’t been able to make contact with hundreds of businesses.</p>
<p>A survey by the National Restaurant Association in mid-April found that 50% of restaurants in Pennsylvania have continued operating on a limited basis.</p>
<p>Should customers relying on takeout to satisfy their cravings for their favorite foods be worried about getting sick? What if a cook has the coronavirus?</p>
<p>“There’s no scientific evidence that a person can contract [the virus] from food. It doesn’t grow in food,” Ms. Scharding said.</p>
<p>The department does recommend that customers unpack takeout containers, put the food on plates, and then wash their hands in case the packaging has been contaminated.</p>
