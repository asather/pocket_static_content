<h1>$10 million fund to help artists affected by COVID-19 pandemic</h1>

<p><span data-mce-mark="1">U.S. artists who are facing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic can apply for $5,000 relief grants from a new $10 million fund.</span></p>
<p>The $10 million fund, which began with a $5 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation,&nbsp;offers artists&nbsp;unrestricted $5,000 grants. Artists can apply at a new website, <a href="http://www.artistrelief.org" target="_blank">www.artistrelief.org</a>.</p>
<p>The initiative to aid artists was organized by a coalition of seven grantmakers — the Academy of American Poets, Artadia, Creative Capital, Foundation for Contemporary Arts, MAP Fund, National YoungArts Foundation and United States Artists.</p>
<p>“In hard times like these, we turn to the arts to illuminate and help us make meaning and find connection. Without immediate intervention, individual artists and the arts ecosystem of which they are the foundation could sustain irreparable damage,” said Elizabeth Alexander, a poet, memoir writer and president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>
<p>Practicing artists who live in all 50 states, territories or tribal nations and work in any artistic discipline are eligible to apply for the grants. Applicants must be 21 or older, able to receive taxable income in the United States regardless of their citizenship status and have lived and worked primarily in the U.S. during the last two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artists who demonstrate the most severe financial needs will receive priority. Money will be distributed across the nation and in various disciplines.&nbsp;The fund will operate through the next six months as organizers monitor the pandemic’s impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nick Cave, an artist and board member of Artadia, said he was relieved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The economic security of most artists is already so precarious, and this crisis could have an irrevocable toll on our community,” he said in a statement. “There needs to be immediate intervention and I’m proud that so many nonprofits, philanthropists and partners are chipping in to do what they can.”</p>
<p>Tax-deductible donations may be made at <a href="http://www.artistrelief.org" target="_blank">www.artistrelief.org</a>&nbsp;and 100 percent of donations will go directly to artists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contributions to the $10 million fund are being made by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the 7G Foundation, Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation, Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, Emily Hall Tremaine Foundation, Ford Foundation, Helen Frankenthaler Foundation COVID-19 Relief Effort, Jerome Foundation, Joan Mitchell Foundation, Kraus Family Foundation, LeRoy Neiman and Janet Byrne Neiman Foundation, Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts, Pritzker Pucker Family Foundation, Richard Salomon Family Foundation, Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Sue Hostetter and Beau Wrigley Family Foundation, Teiger Foundation, Wallace Foundation and Willem de Kooning Foundation.</p>
