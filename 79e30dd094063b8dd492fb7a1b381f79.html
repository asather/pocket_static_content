<h1>Ron Cook: Bad time for Penguins to slide, but don't panic just yet</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two moments have defined the Penguins’ hideous six-game losing streak. Both involved Sidney Crosby, which shouldn’t be surprising considering he, like the rest of his teammates, has been awful during the slide. And, yes, it is shocking that Crosby has played so poorly.</p>
<p>The first moment happened late in the 5-3 loss to Washington Feb. 23 after T.J. Oshie scored the winning goal. Crosby, on the ice at the time, slammed his stick a few times when he got back to the bench, then broke it over his thigh. The way the Penguins’ season has gone with injuries, it was lucky he didn’t put himself out for six weeks.</p>
<p>The second moment happened late in the first period of the 2-1 loss to the Los Angeles Kings Wednesday night. Crosby thought he scored to give the Penguins a 2-1 lead when he redirected a pass from Jason Zucker past goaltender Calvin Petersen. But the puck hit the crossbar, dropped straight down and rolled along the goal line without going across. Crosby muttered in disbelief and said a few choice words to referee Ghislain Hebert after replay determined no goal. At least Crosby’s stick didn’t die a gruesome death, if you are looking for something positive.</p>
<p>These are brutal times for the Penguins and for Crosby. The losing streak dropped the team into third place in the Metropolitan Division through Saturday’s games, just two points ahead of the fourth-place New York Islanders and only five points ahead of Carolina for the final playoff spot. It was outscored, 24-8, in the six losses, the final three coming against Los Angeles, Anaheim and San Jose, three of the NHL’s worst clubs. Crosby scored just one goal, didn’t have an assist and was a minus-8.</p>
<p>Crosby took responsibility for all of it because that’s what great captains do.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to step up. Key situations, you’re down like this and losing games, you need big plays, big performances. And I haven’t done that. So that’s on me.”</p>
<p>Crosby certainly isn’t alone in his misery.</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe a team with so much talent and so much speed suddenly can’t score a goal.</p>
<p>Zucker scored both goals in the 3-2 loss to Anaheim Friday night but had just one assist and was a minus-6 in the other five losses. Bryan Rust had one goal and one assist during the losing streak. Even Evgeni Malkin and Patric Hornqvist struggled in the three losses on the West Coast with just one assist each.</p>
<p>But the Penguins’ scoring issues started even before their slide. You knew that might happen when 40-goal scorer Jake Guentzel went down for the season Dec. 30. It just took a little longer than expected.</p>
<p>Jared McCann has no goals in his past 17 games, Dominik Simon none in the past 12. Brandon Tanev has one goal in the past 19 games, Teddy Blueger two in the past 15. Even the offensive-skilled defensemen have done little. Kris Letang has no goals in the past seven games, Justin Schultz just one assist in 14 games since coming back from injury.</p>
<p>The special teams have been lousy. The power play went 1-for-18 during the losing streak. The penalty kill allowed six goals in 17 chances.</p>
<p>The goaltenders haven’t played as well, but that is mostly because they have been sabotaged by poor play in front of them. Matt Murray gave up four, four and three goals in his three starts during the losing streak, Tristan Jarry five, two and five goals during his three starts.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Jim Rutherford has been criticized for tinkering with a good thing by trading for Zucker, Patrick Marleau, Conor Sheary and Evan Rodrigues. But that’s ridiculous. Taking Alex Galchenyuk and Dominik Kahun out of the room hardly hurt the team or damaged the chemistry. It wouldn’t hurt, though, if Marleau, Sheary and Rodrigues started contributing a little to the offense. They didn’t have a goal or an assist and were a combined minus-4 in their three games since joining the Penguins a week ago.</p>
<p>So what’s ahead?</p>
<p>I believe the Penguins will find their way, although the home game Tuesday night against Ottawa would not be too soon to start. I’m certainly not ready to write them off as a Stanley Cup contender. All they need to do, for starters, is match Hornqvist’s intensity. He is the one player who shows up every night. How do you not love that? “Play like Hornie play,” Malkin agreed. “He’s an unbelievable player. He never stops.”</p>
<p>Brian Dumoulin, out hurt for 37 games, and John Marino, out 11, are close to returning and will give the defense a big lift. They will drop Schultz and Jack Johnson down in the rotation. Fewer minutes for Schultz and Johnson will be a good thing.</p>
<p>Most of all, I believe Crosby will get back to being Crosby. I think of a wonderful quote from long-time former NHL coach Mike Babcock, maybe the best thing ever said about Crosby:</p>
<p>“He is addicted to winning.”</p>
<p>It’s good that Crosby is taking the losses so hard. Opponents are going to pay a price for his anger, frustration and passion.</p>
<p>Soon.</p>
