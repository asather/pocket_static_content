<h1>Sister of Oakmont man charged in daughter’s abuse death says he’s innocent</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A sister of the Oakmont man <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/24/Oakmont-child-death-charges-homicide-abuse/stories/202006240143" target="_blank">charged last week</a> in his 3-year-old daughter’s death defended her brother on Thursday and said he loved the girl.</p>
<p>“My brother is not capable of doing that. He’s innocent,” Sindia Salazar-Ortiz said of her older brother, Jose Salazar-Ortiz Sr. “He’s devastated. It’s heartbreaking. It was his daughter. He lost the only daughter he had.”</p>
<p>Mr. Salazar-Ortiz, 29, his common-law wife, Laura Ramriez, and her sister, Alexis Herrera, have all been charged with homicide and other crimes in the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2020/06/09/death-of-3-year-old-girl-Oakmont-10th-Street-Allegheny-County-police-investigate/stories/202006090143" target="_blank">June 9 death</a> of Bella Seachrist.</p>
<p>Police described how Bella was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/25/oakmont-child-abuse-bella-seachrist-homicide-police-arrest-ramriez-herrera/stories/202006250108" target="_blank">beaten, punched, knocked out</a>, pushed down stairs, sexually abused, screamed at, bound and gagged, tied to a banister and kept inside out of public view and in her home on 10th Street in the nine months or so leading up to her death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Salazar-Ortiz blamed Ms. Ramriez for the abuse and said she had&nbsp;“a lot of temper,” according to court paperwork. He told police that Ms. Ramriez was angry that Bella was born to a woman with whom he had an affair.</p>
<p>Ms. Herrera also blamed Ms. Ramriez and confessed to abusing Bella herself, a criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>Mr. Salazar-Ortiz’s attorney, Blaine Jones, echoed the sentiments of his client’s sister.</p>
<p>“He was broken, broken when I first spoke to him,” Mr. Jones said. “It hit him. He was in shock, let’s put it like that.”</p>
<p>Detectives said that Mr. Salazar-Ortiz told them that he worked six days a week, at least 12 hours a day, and left Bella and the couple’s three boys in the care of Ms. Ramriez, 27, and Ms. Herrera, 20.</p>
<p>”He loved her so much. I don’t think he’s capable of doing that. The love he had for Bella, it was only love. The same love as for the three boys he had,” Ms. Salazar-Ortiz, 27, of Charlotte, N.C., said.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones said he was hired the day after Bella was found unresponsive at her home and was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. He said his client initially spoke freely with police.</p>
<p>In the complaint, police said Mr. Salazar-Ortiz told detectives that he thought Bella suffered from a condition that caused hair loss and swollen feet and prevented her from putting on weight, though he also acknowledged that the family hadn’t taken her to a doctor in almost two years.</p>
<p>“The way the family was set up was that the husband went out and he worked, and he worked six days a week, usually 12 hours a day, to provide, and the mother would take care of the kids,” Mr. Jones said.</p>
<p>Bella was 29 pounds when she died. An autopsy revealed that she died from child abuse and neglect, malnutrition and failure to thrive.</p>
<p>“There's no allegations of any type of physical abuse with regard to Mr. Ortiz,” Mr. Jones said.&nbsp;“We did not think he would be charged with anything, but if there was a charge, we did not think it would be homicide... .”</p>
<p>In the complaint, police reference videos, pictures and text messages retrieved from Ms. Ramriez’s and Ms. Herrera’s phones that contain what they said was incriminating evidence of abuse by the women.</p>
<p>“It’s almost like a systematic torturing that killed this girl. It’s insane. None of the two women or any one else said my guy was present while this was going on,” Mr. Jones said.&nbsp;“There's no mention on these recordings on the phone, there's no mention of my guy, his voice, seeing him, none of it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Jones noted that his client had <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/30/Bella-Seachrist-Oakmont-death-court-records-father-custody/stories/202006300132?cid=search" target="_blank">gone to court in 2017 to fight for custody</a> of Bella.</p>
<p>The girl was originally living with her mother, Nicole Seachrist, but police said they were told by Ms. Ramriez that she lost custody&nbsp;“over concerns of substance abuse.”</p>
<p>Court paperwork shows that Allegheny County’s office of Children, Youth and Families filed a dependency petition Jan. 24, 2017 alleging that Bella was&nbsp;“without proper care of control.”</p>
<p>The allegations were upheld two weeks later, but Bella was allowed to stay with her mother. Common Pleas Judge David Spurgeon ordered Ms. Seachrist to complete an evaluation for women in recovery, take random drug tests and keep Bella up to date with doctor’s visits. But the court said she made&nbsp;“minimal progress” and put Bella into foster care on May 31, 2017.</p>
<p>Ms. Seachrist did not ensure that Bella&nbsp;“attend wellness checkups” and did not allow a court-appointed lawyer to see the child, according to court records.</p>
<p>The next day, June 1, 2017, a caseworker contacted Mr. Salazar-Ortiz&nbsp;“regarding the child and return to his care.”</p>
<p>Ms. Salazar-Ortiz said her brother had wanted to be involved in Bella’s life. But, she said, Ms. Ramriez wouldn’t allow that.</p>
<p>“She wouldn’t really let him be involved,” Ms. Salazar-Ortiz said.&nbsp;“This was all Laura, she didn’t want him to be involved in this.”</p>
<p>At this point, the court allowed Ms. Seachrist to have three supervised visits a week with Bella. Mr. Salazar-Ortiz was given three supervised visits total, according to the court paperwork.</p>
<p>On June 28, 2017, CYF determined that Mr. Salazar-Ortiz’s home was&nbsp;“suitable” for a child. Judge Spurgeon ordered Bellaw to be returned to Mr. Salazar-Ortiz, and she came to live with him and Ms. Ramriez on July 9, 2017. Ms. Seachrist was granted visitation, but she didn’t follow through, according to a custody petition.</p>
<p>In August 2017, the court closed the case, granting Mr. Salazar-Ortiz primary physical and sole legal custody of Bella.</p>
<p>CYF said by law it could not confirm or deny involvement in a case. Ms. Seachrist has not responded to requests for comment. On Sunday Bella’s grandmother, Dolly Seachrist, said county child advocates <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/28/Bella-Rae-Seachrist-Oakmont-vigil-family-justice-Verona-abuse-torture/stories/202006280114?cid=search" target="_blank">didn’t do enough research</a> before allowing the girl to go into her father’s custody.</p>
<p>After about year, Bella was sent to North Carolina to live with Mr. Salazar-Ortiz’s large family in Charlotte; he is one of seven children. It was not clear why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ramriez told detectives that that she had no idea Jose was taking Bella to North Carolina,” the complaint against all three defendants said.</p>
<p>Bella returned to Oakmont about a year later, in August or September 2019. Police reviewed photos of Bella at the time and wrote that they “show a well-nourished child without any apparent injuries. Further investigation revealed that&nbsp;Ortiz Sr. traveled to North Carolina to bring Bella from North Carolina back to the custody of Ramriez and Ortiz, Sr.”</p>
<p>When Bella came home, she returned to a life of abuse, police said, documented in nauseating detail in the police complaint.</p>
<p>But during the last 10 months of her life, Bella’s family in North Carolina was none the wiser to what police say was happening behind closed doors, Ms. Salazar-Ortiz said.</p>
<p>“My brother would send my mom pictures of Bella,” she said.&nbsp;“She seemed good.”</p>
<p>Ms. Salazar-Ortiz said she saw Bella every day when the girl lived with the family in Charlotte and that the girl played with her children.</p>
<p>“She was just playful, caring and loving,” Ms. Salazar-Ortiz said.</p>
<p>The lawyer for Ms. Herrera declined comment. It was unclear who was representing Ms. Ramriez.</p>
