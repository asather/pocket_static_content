<h1>TV Q&amp;A: Where did TruTV’s ‘Tacoma F.D’ go?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Post-Gazette TV writer Rob Owen answers reader questions <a href="http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment-living/tuned-in" target="_blank">online every Friday in Tuned In Journal blog at post-gazette.com/tv</a>. Here’s a selection of recent queries.</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: What happened to "Tacoma F.D." on TruTV? They announced they were having a 14-episode season that started airing at the end of March (and I assume all those shows were "in the can"), but they haven't shown a single episode in more than a month. What's going on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—CHAD VIA EMAIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Turns out even though filming wrapped last year, the episodes were <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_ndouMADjX/?igshid=1iy4707w7gi1n" target="_blank">not all edited when the pandemic hit</a>. The show ran into delays in post-production and the season was split up with the last seven episodes airing beginning July 23 at 10 p.m., followed at 10:30 by the after-show “Talkoma FD.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: I like “This Old House. “ Why does WQED-TV show two episodes one week, then not show another for three or four weeks?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—BOB, WILKINS TWP.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> A WQED representative says the station airs two episodes of “This Old House” on Saturday but the station also has at least one, and sometimes two, pledge weekends during the month. During a weekend pledge period, “This Old House” is pre-empted.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why aren't people in beer commercials permitted to drink their beers, yet they are allowed in a show?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—BOB, MT. LEBANON</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Drinking in a beer ad <a href="https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/20/heineken/neil-patrick-harris-heineken-ad-we-cant-drink-tv/" target="_blank">is not banned by r</a><a href="https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/20/heineken/neil-patrick-harris-heineken-ad-we-cant-drink-tv/" target="_blank">egulation</a> but networks have traditionally frowned on it&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: After watching the first episode of History’s “Washington” I am at a loss as to where in the United States this was filmed. None of the background shots of the mountains, fields or towns look like any historical sites and places in the Virginia or Pennsylvania area. According to IMDB.com the filming occurred in Romania. Can this be right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>-GARY, BROOKVILLE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Yep, Romania was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/2020/02/13/Wiz-Khalifa-Duncanville-FOX-Washington-History-Visible-LGBTQ-Harry-Dickinson/stories/202002110130" target="_blank">the filming location of the dramatic recreations</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s weird and sort of un-American but not altogether unusual. History’s 2012 “Hatfield &amp; McCoys” mini-series also filmed in Romania as did portions of the 2003 period American feature film “Cold Mountain.” Romania is cheap and producers evidently figure it looks enough like historical America to be passable.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I've noticed that a number of cable channels show “Chicago P.D.” in reruns. I was curious why the other two Chicago shows (“Fire” and “Med”) are not shown on any other cable channels in reruns. Is there any particular reason why “P.D.” is but the other two are not?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—JOE, GLENSHAW</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Not that I am aware of. But it could have to do with the giant deal NBC did with Dick Wolf Entertainment to stream all of Wolf’s Chicago-set series on the upcoming streaming service Peacock, which launches July 15.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Did ABC ever cite why they canceled "The Chew" in favor of a show that has pulled in worse ratings?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—CHAD VIA E-MAIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> ABC took a chance on “Good Morning America” spin-off “GMA3.” Canceling an existing show for a new series is always a gamble and one networks have made since the start of the TV business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/chew-canceled-abc-low-ratings-mario-batali-sexual-misconduct-accusations/" target="_blank">An insider told TheWrap.com in 2018</a> “The Chew” was canceled for “business reasons,” notably a 13% drop year-to-year in women 18-49, which landed the show in 13th place out of 13 daytime shows.</p>
