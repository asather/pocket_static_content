<p>PHILADELPHIA — Philadelphia Flyers mascot Gritty has been cleared of allegations that he assaulted a 13-year-old boy during a photo shoot, police said.</p>
<p>Chris Greenwell and his son Brandon met the hairy, googly eyed mascot at a November event for season ticket holders. Brandon patted Gritty on the head after he and his father posed for a photo with him at Wells Fargo Center, Greenwell has said.</p>
<p>Greenwell said that as Brandon walked away, Gritty ran out of his chair and “punched my son as hard as he could.”</p>
<p>Greenwell, who has said he only wanted an apology and something special for his son, filed a complaint with police Dec. 21. But police announced Monday that their investigation determined that “the actions of the individual portraying the Flyers’ mascot did not constitute physical assault as alleged.”</p>
<p>Officials at Comcast Spectacor, the company that owns the Flyers, have said the firm conducted an investigation but couldn’t verify whether the alleged assault happened.</p>
