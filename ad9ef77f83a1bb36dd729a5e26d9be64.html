<h1>Pet Tales: How to help dogs cope with the coronavirus shutdown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Happy, tail-wagging dogs are getting more walks than ever before, as shelter in place orders give them more time with the people they love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is a good time to enjoy your dog,” said trainer Deborah Miller-Gurchak, who lives in Peters with four Shetland sheepdogs who win ribbons and titles at dog shows and obedience competitions.</p>
<p>But while her shelties continue to enjoy their back yard romps and training sessions, other dogs are acting up and picking up bad vibes from owners&nbsp; stressed by the coronavirus pandemic. Dogs that have been housebroken for years are defecating and urinating in the house.&nbsp; Others are destroying furniture or their own toys. Canines that have peacefully co-existed for years have started fighting.&nbsp;Social media videos abound with barking dogs providing background&nbsp;“music” to Zoom and Skype conferences as their owners try to work from home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When life returns to normal and people go back to work and school, dogs will have to adjust again. Some won’t be happy about it and may experience separation anxiety.&nbsp;Four local trainers have tips on what to do with dogs now — and when it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>Annette Sexton, Mount Washington</strong></p>
<p>“Dogs are best on a regular schedule,” Annette Sexton said.&nbsp;“Try to keep them on their regular schedule as much as possible.” For the dogs of people who usually work in an office, that means sleeping most of the day — in a crate or in a designated place.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Too late for that? Try to gradually ease them back to their “old” schedule.</p>
<p>Ms. Sexton advises leaving them home alone at times, even if you are just going outside for fresh air. If you have a phone call or virtual meeting coming up in the morning, hold back half of the morning breakfast kibble and scatter it throughout the house&nbsp; so the dog can play&nbsp;“hide and seek” when you work.</p>
<p>She likes the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/canineenrichment/" target="_blank">Canine Enrichment Facebook</a> page, which has lots of games and activities for dogs and people.</p>
<p>Ms. Sexton is still working in the Pittsburgh Public Safety Department, where her clerical job is deemed essential. So the daily schedules of her Beaucerons&nbsp; Enya, 10, and Enigma, 2, have remained the same.</p>
<p>A longtime trainer who has worked at local shelters, Ms. Sexton does at-home consults. Most of her clients are referred by veterinarians but she can be emailed at <a href="mailto:inawolfshadow@yahoo.com" target="_blank">inawolfshadow@yahoo.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Marsha Robbins, Brookline</strong></p>
<p>”My five dogs are just really clingy, now, and they are starting to get snarky with each other,” Marsha Robbins said. Of course that behavior doesn’t escalate into dog fights — not when the owner is a retired special education teacher who teaches obedience and therapy dog classes at Humane Animal Rescue.</p>
<p>When the snarkiness starts, she redirects their behavior by giving them a toy or something to do that is positive.</p>
<p>All of her dogs are certified therapy dogs and are used to seeing 200 people a week in visits to the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University and other places.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They are used to regularly meeting new people and visiting with old friends” and they miss that, Ms. Robbins said. “They are used to me leaving for a while each day, so I’m still doing that.”</p>
<p>Dogs that are now constantly with their people&nbsp;“are exhausted from following you all day,” she said, and that can result in bad behavior. Dogs need time to sleep in a crate or a dog bed in a quiet place.</p>
<p>Because groomers are not considered essential, “grooming and brushing is now almost a full-time job for me,” said Ms. Robbins, who adopted her dogs from shelters.</p>
<p>She said she picked mixes with long hair that is less likely to cause allergic reactions in people visited by therapy dogs.&nbsp;Her dogs are Maui,14, a poodle/Havanese; Sizzle,12, poodle; Margo, 9, poodle/bichon; Ming, 11, Pekingese/poodle; and Presto, 6, Yorkshire terrier/poodle.</p>
<p><strong>Maribeth Hook, Point Breeze</strong></p>
<p>Kobi,11, Frisco, 5, and Abby, 3, have been acting differently since the COVID-19 virus shut down the classes they enjoy at Keystone Canine Training Club and other venues. They are Australian shepherds, a breed known to be very high-energy. They need a lot of activity, including training classes.</p>
<p>The trio are&nbsp;“picking up on my stress,” Maribeth Hook said, running around the house more and begging for food. “Abby now goes nowhere without a tennis ball. So we are back to doing more obedience work.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Hook makes sure the dogs are still accustomed to her leaving them alone in the house at times.</p>
<p>“When I leave I give them treats — stuffed Kongs or anything that is long-lasting and safe, things they can’t choke on.” That makes her exits a positive experience for the dogs.</p>
<p>She recommends the <a href="https://www.spiritdogtraining.com/" target="_blank">SpiritDog Training</a> website and Facebook page, which offer a free, 14-day training course. Also, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VBCCO/" target="_blank">Behavior Vets</a> Facebook page outlines schedules and things to do with your dogs.</p>
<p>Ms. Hook works with people who adopted Australian shepherds and other mixes rescued from a hoarder house by Animal Friends. The dogs have many behavioral issues but are improving rapidly, she said. She teaches at Keystone and works with the <a href="https://www.speakfortheunspoken.com/" target="_blank">Speak for the Unspoken</a> rescue group, which works with deaf dogs and others with special needs.</p>
<p><strong>Deborah Miller-Gurchak, Peters</strong></p>
<p>“I miss the people I train with at training clubs,” said Deborah Miller-Gurchak, but she’s still doing basic obedience training at home with her Shetland sheepdogs Heather, 14, Patty, 14, Sparky, 9, and Myrrh-Sadie, 18 months.</p>
<p>Ms. Miller-Gurchak thinks everyone should do basic obedience with dogs and take them on daily walks.&nbsp;She’s currently getting questions from inexperienced dog owners who thought this would be a great time to adopt a puppy. Now they’re having trouble, including a puppy who “nips” when corrected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She’s been helping people train their dogs for more than 40 years at her Hollybush Dog Training Services. She can’t do at-home consults right now but has information on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Hollybush-Dog-Training-Services-162364427124645/" target="_blank">Hollybush Facebook page</a>. She invites people to post their problems and questions there or call her at 724-942-3134.&nbsp;</p>
