<h1>Bethel Park schools prepare for hybrid model </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bethel Park School District is set to transition to a hybrid model of delivering education to its students on Oct. 5.</p>
<p>“Right now we’re in the remote phase” Zeb Jansante, assistant superintendent for administration, said at Tuesday’s board meeting.</p>
<p>In a hybrid model, students would attend school in two cohorts two days a week and continue with remote classes the other three days. Currently, the district is only offering remote classes to students — some days with live teachers and other days asynchronously. At the elementary level, students get four days of synchronous learning.</p>
<p>While the administration admitted to some technical problems early on with remote learning, Janet O’Rourke, assistant superintendent for curriculum and special services, said, “I think we’re getting better every day in what we are providing our students, and we’re moving forward.”</p>
<p>She said most teachers are working from their school buildings, and some students — such as life skills and those who need autistic support service — have been able to be taught in person.</p>
<p>The board has not been permitting in-person comments at its meetings due to COVID-19, but it did read several letters from parents who were in favor of moving toward the hybrid option or full in-person instruction sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Chrissy and Daniel Davis sent a letter to the board stating that their kindergartner’s teacher has been doing a great job, but someone still has to sit with her while she completes her work.</p>
<p>“We both work. This is not a realistic approach for a working family — not to mention my child is not being challenged because through this approach, there isn’t a realistic way to approach her skill level,” Mr. and Mrs. Davis said in their letter. They added that much of the class is simply kids interrupting or not being able to get Zoom to work.</p>
<p>“I’m begging you to please let our children go back to school and consider allowing kindergarten to attend four days a week,” they wrote. “Please do not make us stressed and frustrated parents wait until Oct. 5. Our children need to be in school now.”</p>
<p>Parent Alex Linden, who also wrote a letter to the board, said her eighth grader has had “no continuity” with her child’s schedule in the remote environment. “There is no structure. There is no learning routine,” she said.</p>
<p>In the remote model, secondary students in the district have two days of synchronous learning with a live teacher and three days of asynchronous school work.</p>
<p>“The students are not learning anything right now. Other districts have figured out how to make this work, and we are sort of just pretending this will magically just work out,” Ms. Linden said. “The school administration is failing the students of our school district and not providing the education they deserve.”</p>
<p>The board, which did not take a vote on the Oct. 5 hybrid start date, meets Tuesday.</p>
