<h1>Fishing Report: A good day on steelhead waters for senior citizen brothers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Fishing continues to be a family affair for John Eungerman, 68, of Wexford and Ed Ungerman, 67, of the North Side. Under 43-degree Erie County skies Monday, the brothers netted several nice steelhead on slightly murky Elk Creek about a mile south of I-90.</p>
<p>“I thought I had a snag, a log,” said John Ungerman. The colorful hook-jawed 10-pounder was taken on a submerged dry fly attractor anchored by a Berkley PowerBait minnow.</p>
<p>Ed Ungerman landed a fresh chromer also using a Berkley minnow fished deep. In all, the Ungermans landed three steelhead and lost several others in four hours of “quality fishing,” John said.</p>
<p>After six decades together on the water, Ed holds the angling edge.</p>
<p>“He’s the master, he knows it all really well,” said John. “Fortunately there’s no competition between us. We learned that from our father and have passed it on to our kids.”</p>
<p>Statewide, most stocked trout waters will be closed March 1 through April 18.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries </strong>(Erie County)&nbsp;With no hardtop on the bay, boat anglers tried unsuccessfully to find yellow perch in very cold water. Fresh silver bullets and dark survivors of fall runs were taken throughout the bigger tributaries, particularly on middle and upper Elk Creek. Live minnows and single eggs were hot. Pittsburghers including Jim Kramer of Bulger and Tony Fazio of Forest Hills caught and released good-size brown trout on Elk and Walnut creeks.</p>
