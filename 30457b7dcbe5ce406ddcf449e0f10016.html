<h1>Tree of Life rabbi, Charleston pastor plan Facebook talk on racism tonight</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The rabbi of Tree of Life / Or L’Simcha Congregation in Pittsburgh and the pastor of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., both of whose sanctuaries were targeted by mass killers in hate crimes, will be holding an online discussion on Facebook about racism Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jeffrey Myers and the Rev. Eric Manning will speak from 8:30 p.m. to about 9:30 p.m. ET under the theme of&nbsp;“Racism: A conversation between friends.” It will be <a href="https://www.facebook.com/treeoflifepgh" target="_blank">livestreamed at Facebook.com/treeoflifepgh</a>.</p>
<p>The event is being held in response to issues of racism raised amid the protests following the Memorial Day death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died beneath the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer now charged with his killing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tree of Life’s Squirrel Hill synagogue was targeted in an anti-Semitic attack on Oct. 27, 2018, by a gunman who killed 11 worshipers from three congregations sharing its space. The historically black Mother Emanuel Church was attacked on June 17, 2015, by a white-supremacist gunman now on death row.</p>
<p>Rabbi Myers, who survived the synagogue attack, and Rev. Manning, a successor to Emanuel’s slain pastor, have visited each others’ congregations and offered ongoing support.</p>
<p>Tonight’s event will be archived for future viewing.</p>
