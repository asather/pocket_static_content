<h1>First Commonwealth to close bank branches as it deals with pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>First Commonwealth Bank will be closing around 20% of its 148 physical branches before the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The planned closures are part of a cost-cutting initiative implemented, according to the Indiana, Pa.-based bank’s CEO Mike Price, with “the express goal of emerging on the other side of the pandemic stronger than ever.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>After taking a severe hit in the first quarter, the bank’s finances showed improvement in the second-quarter report released Wednesday. At 24 cents per share in earnings vs. 5 cents in the first quarter,&nbsp;Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jim Reske described it as a strong rebound.</p>
<p>“Although we’re in the early innings of the economic recession, we’re pleased with the projections from our second quarter,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First Commonwealth isn’t the only bank consolidating branches because of the pandemic. Major Downtown-based bank PNC has also set a goal of closing close to 100 of its 2,459 branches by the year’s end, and Delaware-based WSFS Financial Services plans to close 25 branches owned by its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>According to the second-quarter report, the First Commonwealth earnings per share came in at more than double the projected income of 9 cents per share for the quarter, although results were still down significantly from last year’s second quarter.</p>
<p>First Commonwealth’s second-quarter revenue this year totaled $88.9 million, down 14.5% from the same quarter in 2019. Net income of $23.9 million was down almost 13% from the same quarter a year ago.</p>
<p>In a conference call with analysts Wednesday, Mr. Price said First Commonwealth was generally pleased with the results.</p>
