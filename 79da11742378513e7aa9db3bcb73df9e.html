<h1>Labor leaders cancel Labor Day Parade for Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Labor leaders in Allegheny County announced Friday they will forego the traditional Labor Day parade this September and opt for a membership-wide weekend of service.</p>
<p>Citing the unsafe nature of holding such a large gathering in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Darin Kelly, president of the Allegheny-Fayette Central Labor Council, said safety for the workers the council represents and the community at large is what led leaders to make the decision.</p>
<p>Instead of holding the nation's "biggest and most extravagant Labor Day parade," the council's weekend of service will include such actions as cleaning parks and trails and holding a virtual reading session on labor history, and culminate in a "Day of Giving" that will include a blood drive and food drive, Mr. Kelly said.</p>
<p>"This has not been an easy time, but this was the right decision," said Mr. Kelly, flanked by Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and dozens of workers.</p>
