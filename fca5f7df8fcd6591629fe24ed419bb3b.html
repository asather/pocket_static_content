<p><em>Welcome to Brian Batko’s offseason-occasional Steelers mailbag. You’re more than welcome to email him at bbatko@post-gazette.com, tweet him @BrianBatko or slide into his DMs to inquire about the Steelers, NFL or anything out of bounds. </em></p>

<p><strong>Turk in MD:</strong> Hi Brian. ILB depth looks like the one position of obvious need not addressed in the draft. Is re-signing Barron still a possibility or has the team moved on?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> It seems they’ve moved on from Mark Barron, but you’re right, there’s no obvious answer to the loss of Barron’s 69% share of the snaps. Vince Williams (37%) could play more, but if the Steelers didn't want to sign up for that a year ago, why would they now? Let’s take a look at the other internal candidates:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Ulysees Gilbert, a sixth-round draft pick last year who played precisely zero defensive snaps his rookie season before his season ended with a back injury. He’s a prototypical size (6-0, 230) and speed (4.51 40) prospect, but it’s hard to imagine the Steelers have seen enough of him in their defense to really feel comfortable vaulting him into significant action.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Robert Spillane, an undrafted free agent who replaced Gilbert on special teams but logged just one defensive play in 2019, in garbage time. Spillane is 6-1, 229 pounds, but his athleticism is likely why he wasn't drafted in 2018, running a 4.77 40 at his pro day at Western Michigan. He also didn't make the team over Gilbert coming out of the preseason last year.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Marcus Allen, our first in the safeties portion of the options. Allen has decent size at 6-2, 215, but this is the second consecutive offseason he’s been discussed as someone whose usage could increase with a change in role. It didn't come to pass last year, another one he spent mostly on the practice squad after not making the team out of camp. He also did not play at all on defense in the one game he was active.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Terrell Edmunds, who had some hybrid traits when the Steelers used a first-round pick on him the year before Bush but has been used exclusively in the secondary. At 6-1, 217, Edmunds is about the same size as Allen, but playing him at linebacker creates yet another void at strong safety. At this point, the backups are Allen and Jordan Dangerfield, a special teams staple. He’d likely be up to the challenge as coverage linebacker but would need to improve his tackling.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Antoine Brooks Jr., the new toy in the room. When the Steelers used their sixth-round pick on him Saturday, Mike Tomlin and Kevin Colbert lauded his versatility at 5-11, 220 pounds, something of an ideal build for today’s sub-package football. He’s sturdy, he can hit, and he can move, but how quickly can he get up to speed without any NFL experience and now a mostly virtual offseason ahead of him? The Steelers didn't ask Gilbert as a sixth-rounder to step right in and help on defense.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;As for free agents, there aren't many still available who played inside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme last year. Wesley Woodyard was a backup for the Titans last year and turns 34 in July. Alec Ogletree was released in February by the Giants after struggling in coverage last season and will be 29 in September. The others barely played more defensive snaps than Gilbert and Spillane a year ago.</p>
<p>Other than shifting around personnel, the Steelers also could experiment with more formations that leave Bush as the lone inside linebacker on the field. After all, they already play more nickel, with five defensive backs, than base 3-4 defense. Still, it’s hard to overlook the fact that he and Barron played together as the lone inside linebacker duo on 510 of 1,084 snaps in 2019. It could take a decent amount of tweaking to devise a new-look middle of the defense in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>@LudaChristian25:</strong> If you could have any Avenger lining up at safety opposite Minkah, who would best complement his style of play?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Haven't seen any of the Marvel movies, so let’s just punt on this question rather than give a woefully uninformed answer. My favorite superhero is my wife.</p>
<p><strong>@BittmanSkip:</strong> How did Cleveland get the draft before Pittsburgh?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> The league probably figured there’s always a decent chance the Browns are looking for their next franchise quarterback, maybe even with a new coaching staff and front office doing the drafting. But even if Baker Mayfield stinks again this year, it’s hard to believe that Cleveland would be picking No. 1 or even find itself in the Trevor Lawrence sweepstakes in April 2021.</p>
<p>As for why that city got the nod before Pittsburgh, well, the announcement from the NFL mentioned intertwining the event with the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, so Cleveland must have presented a spiffy bid to win the draft. VisitPittsburgh has looked into the possibility, though, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/06/25/nfl-draft-locations-pittsburgh-steelers-heinz-field/stories/201906250010" target="_blank">which we wrote about last year</a>. This will shed some light on why the NFL draft isn't set to come here in the near future, if we even continue having in-person draft events after how much people seemed to enjoy watching a virtual version from home.</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> When it comes to the debate that has essentially turned into Jameis Winston versus Mason Rudolph, there’s one fact that always seems to get left out of the discussion. These two quarterbacks actually have faced each other once in the NFL. And Rudolph came out on top.</p>
<p>In last year’s preseason opener at Heinz Field, sure, Winston was pretty solid, completing 5 of 6 passes for 40 yards and a touchdown. But Rudolph was even better, coming off the bench to go 5 for 8 for 91 yards and two scores. That’s a 141.1 rating, more than seven points higher than Winston’s 134 in the same game.</p>
<p>Plus, Winston actually got pulled for Blaine Gabbert in that one. Kind of a head-scratcher. Regardless, Rudolph led a Steelers comeback from an early deficit and they eventually won, 30-28. There are lies, damned lies and statistics, and the numbers clearly show that in the one time they went head to head, Rudolph got the better of Winston.</p>
