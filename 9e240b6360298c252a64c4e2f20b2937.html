<h1>UFC's White calls off next three fights</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The UFC finally joined virtually every other professional sports organization Monday in suspending its upcoming events because of the novel coronavirus outbreak. UFC President Dana White cited new recommendations announced by the White House, particularly one urging people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people, in explaining his abrupt shift from what had been a dogged determined stance to keep staging fights.</p>
<p>Citing an address to the nation from President Donald Trump earlier Monday, White said on ESPN that the UFC had managed to stage a mixed martial arts event with less than 50 people and no fans present, but “now they’re saying there should be no more than 10 in a room, and that’s just impossible.”</p>
<p>“We can’t do it,” he continued, “and we’ve complied with everything that the government and these doctors have said to do, and we have no choice now but to postpone these fights.”</p>
<p>White said his company was calling off its next three events, which had been scheduled for Saturday, March 28 and April 11, but he insisted that UFC 249 would take place on April 18. That event, featuring a much-anticipated lightweight title showdown between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson, might not unfold as planned, however, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>New York’s state of emergency order bans all gatherings of more than 500 people, but White told ESPN that he would be willing to stage it with “no crowd.” He added that it would “probably not even be in the United States” but that he would do “whatever it takes” to make sure it happens.</p>
<p>In an appearance the day before on ESPN, White was adamant that the UFC’s mixed martial arts fights would go on, even if finding sites proved to be problematic.</p>
<p>“Unless there’s a total shutdown of the country, where people can’t leave their houses and things like that, these fights will happen,” White said at the time. “We’re going to move on. These fights will happen. These guys will compete. We will find venues, and we will figure this thing out. I mean, the only thing that’s going to stop us is a complete government shutdown, where everybody is confined to their homes.”</p>
<p>While the NBA, the NHL, the NCAA, the PGA, NASCAR, MLB and Bellator MMA had suspended events, and most people were practicing social distancing in an effort to slow the virus’s progress through the population, White said Sunday that events on March 28 and April 11 would take place, as would the rest of the UFC schedule. Those bouts were moved from Columbus, Ohio, and Portland, Oregon, to Las Vegas, where the UFC’s Apex facility is located, before Monday’s change of course.</p>
<p>Nurmagomedov has been planning for UFC 249 to go on somewhere on schedule. “I don’t understand what is going on outside the gym,” he wrote on Instagram. “I am in the gym and I am working hard. What will happen next no one knows.”</p>
<p>On Monday, the UFC president sent an email to his staff in which he said, according to ESPN, “As you’ve heard me say, I’ve been in the fight game for 20 years, and this is what we do: We find a way to keep our events going no matter what. But this is different. The whole world is being affected right now, and nothing is more important than the health and safety of you and your families.”</p>
