<h1>'That would be amazing': Devin Bush has Michigan defensive prospects thinking Steelers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s safe to say Elias Sports Bureau will be hard at work if the Steelers decide to use a late-round pick on safety depth and land on Josh Metellus.</p>
<p>You could throw a dart at hundreds of prospects and be just as accurate in predicting any of the Steelers’ draft picks next month, but what makes Metellus an interesting name? Because if he ends up in Pittsburgh, he’ll have been teammates with Devin Bush at three levels of football.</p>
<p>Bush and Metellus <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/05/02/devin-bush-steelers-suit-personality-popularity-nfl-michigan-broward-county/stories/201905020142" target="_blank">played together as classmates at Flanagan High School</a> in Pembroke Pines, Fla., then at Michigan, and now Metellus is one of several Wolverines who’d love to hook back up with Bush in the NFL.</p>
<p>“I was telling Bush not too long ago, if y’all need a safety, I’m here for you,” Metellus said with a smile last week at the combine in Indianapolis. “I already know it would be amazing to play with him at the next level. To go 10 to 12 years, back-to-back-to-back, playing with each other? That would be amazing. But at the end of the day, it’s whoever wants me, and if it just happens to be the Steelers, I’m all for it.”</p>
<p>John Harbaugh currently sits atop the AFC North as the Baltimore Ravens head coach, but last year, the Steelers took a liking to Jim Harbaugh’s players at Michigan. In addition to trading up and drafting Bush 10th overall, they used their fifth-round pick on Wolverines tight end Zach Gentry.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Michigan football has had plenty of other connections to Western Pennsylvania recently. Two rounds after Bush, his college teammate and Thomas Jefferson High School graduate Chase Winovich was drafted by the New England Patriots. In this year’s draft class, another Pittsburgh-area product from Michigan via McKeesport hopes to be selected <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/other-colleges/2019/10/09/khaleke-hudson-mckeesport-football-michigan-wolverines-jim-harbaugh-nfl-big-ten/stories/201910040131" target="_blank">in linebacker Khaleke Hudson</a>. And there are even a couple more WPIAL alumni still in Ann Arbor in defensive lineman Donovan Jeter of Beaver Falls and walk-on wide receiver Jack Young of Mt. Lebanon, not to mention incoming linebacker recruit Nikhai Hill-Green, who played his first three years of high school ball at North Catholic.</p>
<p>“I didn't grow up a Steelers fan, but I was happy [Bush] went there,” Hudson said at the combine. “I told him, ‘If you need anything, just let me know, bro.’ I’ve got family down there, a lot of friends that I know who could help him out with anything that he needs.”</p>
<p>Bush didn't need much help during a rookie year in which he was named the team’s top newcomer and led all first-year players with six takeaways. But now there are double-figure Wolverines who could join him in the NFL next season, with Michigan sending 11 players to the combine and four of those on defense.</p>
<p>While Metellus and Hudson are projected by draft experts as Day 3 choices, the best of the bunch might be Josh Uche, a 6-foot-1, 245-pound edge-rusher who led the Wolverines with 11.5 tackles for loss and 8.5 sacks last season. Hudson’s roommate shined in his first and only year as a starter, then declared for the draft after his redshirt junior breakout. Uche enjoyed chatting with Steelers coaches at the combine.</p>
<p>“We talked about Devin Bush a little bit, just his style of play,” Uche said last week. “And also what they look for out of their linebackers, as well as what they look for in the future.”</p>
<p>As for what Uche’s looking for in the future, rejoining Bush would be more than fine with him. Given his draft stock, it would likely take the Steelers eschewing their offensive needs in the second round, or Uche dropping to the middle rounds.</p>
<p>“Who wouldn't want to play for such an amazing organization like that?” Uche said. “Play with my boy D-Bush and wreak havoc, that’d be awesome.”</p>
<p>A year after he became his program’s highest-drafted player since 2008, Bush’s success is motivation for the next crop of Wolverines. But the man himself also still serves as a sounding board and guide for those who hope to be in his shoes by 2021.</p>
<p>Hudson keeps in touch with Bush and got to see him play in-person once with the Steelers. It’s not uncommon for him to watch a game and study his fellow linebacker, who was more than happy to give Hudson advice on the pre-draft process. Same goes for Metellus, who also met with the Steelers in Indianapolis. Perhaps he told them they could make a great story happen if they reunite him with Bush?</p>
<p>“He’s one of my best friends, so he’s always got an open ear, always here to help me out,” Metellus said. “He was basically telling me how fast things move [in the NFL]. Everything’s just at a different speed. You’ve got a lot of people who are great at football, but it just takes that extra mindset to lock in that really separates the best from the best.</p>
<p>“He always preaches to me to just be ready, and if I need anything, I can ask him.”</p>
