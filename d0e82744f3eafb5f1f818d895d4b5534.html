<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 02.13.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: OK running a few bwhind lets get started!!!!</p>
<p><strong>rcc prof</strong>: A Pens question: To me, Bjugstad is a big waste of time and money. Why not put this guy on IR and use the money to insure some depth on the blue line? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think he is coming back isnt he? At least thats what im reading. He is depth for them and depth is important</p>
<p><strong>Norm9955</strong>: Which high school basketball games if any do you plan on seeing this weekend? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: None my son plays for Pitt-Greensburg so ill be watching him Saturday</p>
<p><strong>Realist</strong>: Is the NIT realistic for Duquesne mens basketball this yr....and do you finally see improvement as the trend and not a blip on the RADAR? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I dont think the NIT is more than a 50/50 proposition at this point. They lost a few games in the last couple of weeks that puts them behind other teams. This is not a blip, i think Keith Dambrot is really good and Duquesne is going to be an Altantic 10 power for the foorseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>Utah Jim</strong>: In the next labor agreement will there be a limit on how much cap space can go to QBs? Never understood why the union let‚Äôs so few take so much of the pie. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No. There was a proposal to take QB out of salary cap calculation. It had no chance of going anywhere. It is part of the great equalizer - if you dont have an elite QB you can spend your money elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Mike - Bucco</strong>: What does Tampa Bay do well in player development as a small market that the Pirates keep missing? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Great question. They obviously are very good at drafting and very good at decelopment. That is an area you have to be good at if you are a small market team. Id say it statts with scouting and identifying players who have the tools to be Major League players.</p>
<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Paul, appreciate the chats, besides the upgraded use of pitching analytics, what new coaching methods do the Pirates intend to utilize in their organizational transition ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It seems like the new philosophy will be less ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù and more specific to each pitcher. So for instance Chris Archer was talking about how he was going to be more free to use his strength and strike guys out as opposed to worrying about low pitch count at bats and inducing soft contact. It seems to be based on maximizing each level pitchers individual talent and not trying to shoe horn every guy into one philosophy</p>
<p><strong>jwheaney </strong>: Paul, What is JR's next FA move.. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I am going to guess a defenseman. I think depth is what he will target. And they have some pieces they could still trade. Defense seems to be an area they could use help</p>
<p><strong>jwheaney </strong>: Will Guentzel return for the playoffs? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: All indications are that if the Penguins go deep into the playoffs, he will have a legitimate chance to return. But the Jason Zucker trade suggests that they dont think he will be back any sooner to that. Zucker basically fills the same roles as Guentzel did</p>
<p><strong>Girth the Destoryer</strong>: hey paul, how are the steelers going to tag bud dupree without cutting chick, mcdonald, barron, and foster? Especially If the steelers hope to tender hilton, filer, and banner? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think they are gonna cut Foster and Chickillo, no question. McDonald and Barron are both guys who should at least be worried about getting cut. They are going to have to cut some guys, no doubt</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37 </strong>: Why do Steelers carry a full back when they don't use one ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: He is a good special teams player</p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: On baseball, why not go to 16 teams, and have the first three series five games and WS seven? Shorten the season back to 154. Today, if you are in the play in game, and a five and two 7 games series, you might have to play 20 games. The 5/5/5/7 would be a max of 22 games. Not a big increase, but having more teams in the playoffs makes things more exciting. And all you need is two really good starting pitchers to make a run. (think Diamondbacks with Johnson and Schilling...) <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They arent going to cut the regular season down, they just aren‚Äôt. And more playoff teams just waters it down. I dont mind going to 12 but 16 is way too many. And you cant play baseball into December!!</p>
<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Paul, do you feel that the Steelers give #7 too much input on personnel , is it time to start positioning for the inevitable rebuild ? <br> <strong>Brian</strong>: Paul, best ballpark to visit out of these 3. Cleveland, Philadelphia, Washington DC ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Having been to all three - I like Philadelphia the best. Washington Is a close second Out of those three. I still think PNC Park is nicer than them all</p>
<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Paul, over under on Pirate wins this year ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The last ive seen from Vegas is 70 1/2. I like the under. I see 65-68 wins.</p>
<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Paul, with anniversary of blowing up 3 Rivers Stadium this past week, when do you think that Steelers or Pirates will be requesting a new venue ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well believe it or not both venues are already 20 years old. I would say in about ten years they will start banging the drum for major renovations and/or a new stadium</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: That was a horrible game last night for Pitt. Is it me or are Johnson and McGowen overrated? Neither is a true point guard, neither can shoot from the outside and neither is a true floor general! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Neither of those two are particularly good shooters and to get to the next level as players they need to be. They also aren‚Äôt exactly high IQ basketball players, either. But they play hard, they are really good at getting to the basket and they are the guys who have to score for Pitt to have a chance to win games. That was a horrible game, though. Both absolutely need to get better as shooters</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: Lot of criticism of the Pirates spending is quite general, i.e. $50M payroll too low. OK fair enough. But what specifically should the Pirates do? I remember a Jason Kendall contract which ended up hurting for years. Is there really a $12M a year pitcher would be expected only one more win over Brault if you believe in WAR. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They should just not try and spend any money. I mean the Jason Kendall contract didnt work out so therefore spending money is not worth it!!ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I agree they should not spend money this year but at some point they will need to. And if they dont they will lose all credibilitywith their fans forever</p>
<p><strong>Hawaiiguy</strong>: What does Mike Tomlin do? Wasnt he hired as a defensive specialist? Hes not a a players coach in the sense hes had control of the locker room, and he doesnt do anything on nor for the offense. So why did it take until this year for the defense to be great, and why hasnt Tomlin be held accountable for the defense specifically in the past? Or is he just a figurehead? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Mike Tomlin has done a good iob of getting his teams to play hard and play with a certain toughness almost every week. The fact that he has never had a losing season is all you need to know about how good he is as a coach. Is he perfect? No. He is a lot better than most and he is a lot more consistent than most.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong>: Thoughts on the Jarrod Dyson signing? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I have already ordered my World Series tickets! Not really. I would say this - in the context of trying to improve team defense and doing so as cheap as possible it was an excellent move....</p>
<p><strong>Showdog</strong>: Hey Paul. People are thinking in terms of Dupree getting 16 million. What they have to remember is he is already getting 9 million so they only need to come up with 7 million. Chickillo almost gets them there. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No if you look at the salary cap number for 2020 it only has the players under contract. Dupree counts as 0 right now. The Steelers are like $1 million above the cap in committed contracts. They will need to clear a lot of space for him</p>
<p><strong>rpk21774</strong>: Does a goalie get traded? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Maybe Casey DeSmith but no chance Jarry or Murray gets traded</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Should we be relieved or saddened that MSU did not take our coach? Yes, stability is important in any football program, but is Narduzzi the right person to take Pitt to the next level or are we stuck with mediocrity? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: You should be relieved and happy. The program is on the verge of some really good things. Stability is good. I look at Iowa and say if narduzzi can do here what Kirk Ferentz has done there it would an incredible run for the program</p>
<p><strong>Central PA </strong>: Do you think that Canada will have an influence on the Steelers offense? He did great things for Pitt's running game and has a good track record. Having a great resource like that in-house would be great to leverage.... do you think he'll get a chance to add input? <br> <strong>Brian</strong>: Paul, who is the best winner in Pittsburgh sports history ? I say Mario Lemieux, part of 5 Stanley Cups as a player and owner, your pick ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: He isnt even in my top 5. How about Bill Russell or John Wooden</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Paul, Do you think Penn State is for real and will win a few in in the tournament? Thank you. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes i like the Nittany Lions a lot. They have all the elements you need, they are tough, they play hard, they can score. They are gonna be like a 4 or 5 seed and will give any No. 1 seed fits. They are a really good team</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Other than a true love of baseball, is there any real reason to support the Pirates this year? At least it they were truly rebuilding, you could get excited about young players with potential, by players like Jarrod Dyson do nothing for me. Just another indication that the only thing that the Pirates are committed to is making money! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Thats a good enough reason, isnt it? And there are also some good young players to come out and watch grow up.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaiiguy</strong>: Wasn‚Äôt the NFL taking money from the military in order to do pregame ceremonies directly more disrespectful than some guy not standing for the flag? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The whole ‚Äúfake patriotism at sporting events‚Äù Is one of my biggest pet peeves. I dont have time or energy to get into that subject. If i were king of the world there would be no anthems played at sporting events outside the Olympics</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Pau, What is your favorite sport to follow? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Favorite sport to play (in order): Basketball, Golf, soccer, volleyball. My favorite sports to watch are: golf, baseball, football and basketball in that order <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: OK thats about it, thanks for all the great questions and lets do it again next week! Have a good weekend.....</p>
