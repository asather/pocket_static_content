<h1>Friends and foes agree, 'there really weren't any players' like Troy Polamalu</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In spring 2003, Bill Cowher and Kevin Colbert thought they had their safety. The Steelers coach and director of football operations were flying west for collegiate showcases before the draft. When their private jet landed in Nebraska to refuel, they found out their agreement with free agent safety Dexter Jackson, the reigning Super Bowl MVP, had fallen through.</p>
<p>They continued on to the University of Colorado, where they planned to attend the Buffaloes’ pro day. At breakfast the next morning, they got a call from Steelers scouts at Southern Cal, with reports on an impressive showing from a Trojans safety named Troy Polamalu.</p>
<p>“All of a sudden it was like, wow,” Colbert said. “He is who we thought he was, and we’re gonna have a chance to get him.”</p>
<p>They got him, and Pittsburgh got 12 seasons of mayhem in the defensive backfield. Polamalu eschewed traditional assignments and coverages and used his knowledge of opponents’ tendencies to hijack plays. His versatility contributed to two Super Bowl victories. Now, he is one of 15 modern-era finalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame; should the selection committee, which meets Saturday, grant him 80% of the vote, Polamalu will become a first-ballot enshrinee.</p>
<p>“When you go to the circus, you expect to be entertained, but you never know what trick they would pull off. That’s what Troy was like,” said Ryan Clark, who spent eight years with Polamalu in the Steelers’ defensive backfield. “… You knew he was going to do something that was special.”</p>
<p>Ray Horton knows that feeling. The instincts Polamalu used to time his jump over the line of scrimmage and sack Kerry Collins fractions of a second after the snap, he had in college. In 1999, on the opening kickoff of his first collegiate game against Hawaii, Polamalu, playing on special teams, jumped over the wedge to tackle the return man. “He flew like Superman as if he timed it up,” said Rocky Seto, a defensive coach for USC and later the Seattle Seahawks who was a volunteer coach at the time. Horton, the Detroit Lions’ secondary coach in 2002-03, came away from pre-draft scouting with Polamalu as the top safety on his board.</p>
<p>“We sat in meetings and talked about it, and the consensus from the draft gurus [was] like, ‘Really?’ I go, ‘Yes!’” said Horton, who later coached Polamalu in Pittsburgh for seven years. “This guy is dynamic, he’s all over the place. Now you’re going to have to rein him in a little bit, you’re going to have to teach him some things, but this guy’s got all the tools to be a great safety. They go, ‘No way.’ I said, ‘Somebody’s going to draft this guy in the first round.’ They said, ‘I hope they do, so we don’t have to look at him.’ ”</p>
<p>The Steelers met with Polamalu at the NFL combine and again during a private visit in Pittsburgh before the draft. Convinced he was their man, now they had to figure out, with the 27th overall pick, how to get him. Cowher, who was the Kansas City Chiefs’ defensive coordinator before coaching the Steelers, had a good relationship with Chiefs president and GM Carl Peterson. He knew the Chiefs’ pick, 16th overall, might get it done.</p>
<p>When commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced the trade and the selection, everyone in the Lions draft room turned and looked at Horton. He put his arms in the air: “I told you!”</p>
<p>But Polamalu started zero games in his rookie season.</p>
<p>“We threw a lot at him,” said Cowher, now an NFL analyst for CBS Sports. “He was so talented, we gave him so many different rules and different defenses, and I think at times, we might have done it unfairly. But he was a guy that had such an amazing skill set.”</p>
<p>It didn’t take long.</p>
<p>“We never thought he was going to be a failure, but there was a point in time where we were a little concerned that maybe it wasn't happening as quick as it could,” Colbert said. “Of course that disappeared quickly into his second year and beyond.”</p>

<p>Polamalu, Clark and Deshea Townsend formed the perfect trio to terrorize opposing quarterbacks. They’d concoct some update or improvisation to a scheme and present it to defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau, who frequently approved it.</p>
<p>“And I’d turn to Troy, because Troy was always the triggerman,” LeBeau said. “I’d say ‘Troy, you be careful.’ After about three years, I’d see him coming up to me and they'd present their case and before they left, Troy would say, ‘I’ll be careful, coach.’ ”</p>
<p>Most NFL players crush film. What separated Polamalu was his ability to translate what he saw on film into action on the field. Terry Robiskie, who worked for the Cleveland Browns as receivers coach, offensive coordinator and interim head coach from 2001-06, had a rule for his quarterbacks: “Don’t throw it in his neighborhood. If you mess around with him too much, he's gonna take one. He's gonna fool you into thinking it is what it isn’t and he’s going to steal one.”</p>
<p>In one game, the Browns called a play labeled 585, two 20-yard comebacks by the outside receivers with the tight end running down the middle. The Steelers lined up in quarters coverage, but Polamalu dropped into Cover 3 at the snap. The quarterback broke the rule, threw to Polamalu’s side of the field and watched as he covered the distance to the sideline, picked off the pass and tapped his toes inbounds.</p>
<p>(When the Browns drafted Robiskie’s son Brian, a wide receiver, Brian called his father, who had moved on to the Atlanta Falcons, to ask for advice on facing the Steelers. “Here’s the first thing you do,” Robiskie said. “When you get a chance in pregame warm-ups, you go over and introduce yourself to Mr. Troy — <em>Mister</em> Troy — Polamalu. You tell Troy who you are, tell him you’re my son. Then you tell him, my dad said for me to let you know, I’m not going to cut you one time today. I won’t even try going to go down and try to cut you. Just do me a favor, don’t come flying up here and knock me out.” Polamalu laughed, shook on it and obliged. The advice was prescient. During practice, USC players were supposed to verbally warn their teammates before delivering a crackback block. Once, when Polamalu either didn’t receive or didn’t hear the warning and took a hit, he slammed the offender to the ground and screamed, “You got to holler out the crack!”)</p>
<p>Polamalu’s ability to translate theory into action reached the point where his coaches had to be careful about what they said to him in meetings. Polamalu knew that Terrell Owens only ran corner routes out of a certain formation while with the Dallas Cowboys and earned an easy interception: Owens, seeing Polamalu over the top, broke off the route, but the quarterback threw it anyway and Polamalu ran the route himself. Upon hearing that when the Minnesota Vikings put an extra tight end in the formation, that tight end would never go out for a pass, Polamalu blitzed rather than worry about covering him. He came off the field to an angry call from the press box.</p>
<p>“I go ‘Troy, what are you doing?’” Horton said. “And he goes, ‘Coach, you say he never goes out for a pass, so I blitzed.’ I just hung up the phone.”</p>
<p>His uncanny ability to diagnose plays frustrated his own teammates at times. Polamalu sometimes hopped in on the scout team to challenge the first-string offense, prompting coaches Bruce Arians and Ken Whisenhunt to boot him out.</p>
<p>“I know when Ben [Roethlisberger] first got there, sometimes Ben would be like, ‘Jeez, can you just tell that guy to quit doing it?’ ” Cowher said. “I’m like, ‘Hey listen, this is part of what happens sometimes on Sunday. You’re going to find players like Troy,’ but then you get to Sunday and you really didn’t. There really weren’t any players like Troy, so I understand Ben’s frustration at times.”</p>
<p>Polamalu’s instincts culminated in a crucial play during the AFC championship against the Baltimore Ravens in January 2009. The Ravens cut a 13-point deficit to two in the fourth quarter and were driving. Tight end Todd Heap had just caught a 20-yard pass, and on third-and-13, LeBeau didn’t want to see it happen again.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Troy, get in there and get that tight end negated,’” LeBeau said. “Baltimore thought we were going to blitz, so they went to a max protection and in doing so they slow-blocked. That means the tight end doesn't run out. He stayed in the blocking formation. And as soon as he did that, which they almost never did because he was such a big guy in their passing game, Troy went right to [Joe] Flacco’s eyes.”</p>
<p>Polamalu ranged to his left, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcAhSJZFBB4" target="_blank">intercepted the pass</a> and returned it 40 yards for a touchdown that sealed the game and sent the Steelers to the Super Bowl, which they won.</p>
<p>“He wasn't supposed to be where he was,” Colbert said. “He just made a natural adjustment to the coverage because of something he felt in reading both the quarterback and the receiver’s depth that allowed him to make that play.”</p>
<p>Polamalu impressed coaches and teammates with just about everything he did. LeBeau said he visited UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh after practice every Friday. He initially hesitated when his wife, Theodora, wanted to share a suite with other players’ wives, Horton said, rather than sit in the (cold) seats the Steelers provided. When Robiskie ran into Polamalu and his family at a restaurant before the Super Bowl and Robiskie took notice of the piece of fish Troy was eating, Troy offered him the whole plate.</p>
<p>His spirituality and thoughtfulness resonates now with friends just as much as his play does. Polamalu once traveled to Mount Athos, an important center of Orthodox Christianity on a peninsula in northeastern Greece where only males are allowed, to meet with monks who live there. Once, in Arizona, Cowher told Horton that Polamalu would not be attending the evening meetings. He was fine, the coach said; he was going up in the mountains to visit some monks.</p>
<p>Even though he <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2015/04/09/Steelers-Troy-Polamalu-announces-his-retirement/stories/201504090335" target="_blank">retired after the 2014 season</a>, Polamalu still felt called to football. When Charlie Ebersol, a film and television producer and an old friend, called and asked for advice about starting the Alliance for American Football, Polamalu talked for 20 minutes before Ebersol asked him to run player relations.</p>
<p>“He was meeting with medical people, talking about concussion protocols, talking about counseling protocols for not only players but their families,” said Brad Childress, a longtime coach who faced Polamalu in 2012 as the Browns’ offensive coordinator and briefly coached the AAF’s Atlanta Legends. “That's where I really heard him and got to hear him speak. … He had some questions about playing when he was hurt at Pittsburgh. What his protocol was going to be in the AAF for a guy to make it back to the field was more restrictive than the NFL.”</p>
<p>Polamalu commissioned a study that found a 30% overage on athletic tape, money that he repurposed to hire another masseuse for the Birmingham Iron. He created a framework for family assistance, including marriage counseling and child services. When the AAF folded, Ebersol said, the players still received their workman’s compensation benefits because Polamalu created a system that would survive the league’s dissolution. The only time Ebersol had seen an organization that approached the efficiency of Polamalu’s operation was while he was embedded with Navy SEALs.</p>
<p>“Hines [Ward, who also worked with the AAF] and I were flying together back from training camp and I said to Hines, ‘I can’t believe how well Troy has adapted to executive leadership,’ ” Ebersol said. “He said, ‘There's a reason that. Troy, as the free safety, was allowed to rush the A gap whenever he wanted without seeking coach’s permission.’”</p>
<p>Try to track down people who know Polamalu, and you hear a common refrain: “Anything for Troy.” He’s a man revered both for his talent and physicality and the juxtaposition of that physicality with his soft-spoken, thoughtful disposition.</p>
<p>A Hall of Fame election will only formalize what Steelers fans already know: He was one of the greats.</p>
