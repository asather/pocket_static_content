<p>Five people who police say were involved in damaging or burning of Pittsburgh police vehicles during a protest on May 30 appeared in court Friday for their preliminary hearings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allegheny County district attorney spokesperson Mike Manko said Cameron Guetta,&nbsp;Da’jon Lengyel, Robert Redman, Shaheed Hatch and Khalena Connolly-Wack all appeared in court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since May 30, detectives have been reviewing video footage from city cameras and social media outlets of “the rioting, looting, and vandalism” that took place in Downtown, according to the complaint. City police say they also have received “multiple tips” on identifying individuals that participated in the incidents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police say they received anonymous tips identifying Mr. Guetta,19, of Pittsburgh, as one of the persons allegedly involved in the riot and destruction of police vehicles. When police arrived at Mr. Guetta’s residence, police say Mr. Guetta admitted to punching the vehicle, even showing a scar on his right hand, but told officers that was all he did.</p>
<p>While Mr. Guetta was speaking with police, officers noticed the tattoos on his arm, which they later say they used to identify him on videos from the protest. They then reviewed&nbsp;“high quality HD video”&nbsp; where they saw him using his fists and feet to “damage the marked police car.” Police say Mr. Guetta was visibly seen in the front and center of a crowd that had over run officers, forcing the officers to retreat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the incident, police say Mr. Guetta knocked a rear view mirror&nbsp;off of the vehicle and then began kicking the vehicle repeatedly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint, Mr. Guetta faces charges of criminal mischief, institutional vandalism, riot, obstruction of highways or other public passages, failure to disperse, and disorderly conduct. Mr. Manko said Mr. Guetta waived all charges to court during his hearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Lengyel, 23, of Pittsburgh, faces charges of criminal mischief, institutional vandalism and riot, according to a criminal complaint. Mr. Manko said Mr. Lengyel waived all charges to court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint, police allege Mr. Lengyel&nbsp;was swinging a traffic cone through the window of the police vehicle. Police say they saw him on video allegedly “jump and stomp his feet on the roof of the vehicle, causing additional damage&nbsp;which resulted in large dents and paint damage.”&nbsp; “Lengyel was on top of the car for a long period of time compared to the other&nbsp;rioters and this encouraged additional actors to join in,” the complaint said.</p>
<p>Mr. Redman, 27, of Imperial, faces charges of institutional vandalism, riot, possessing instruments of crime - criminal instruments generally and two counts of criminal mischief. He waived all charges to court during his hearing, Mr. Manko said.</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint, police allege Mr. Redman used a skateboard to hit the police vehicle. Police also allege he sprayed the words “George Floyd” using red spray paint on the I-279 Bridge pillar at the intersection of Crosstown BLVD and Forbes Ave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatch, 27, of Pittsburgh, faces charges of institutional vandalism, criminal mischief, causing or risking catastrophe, and riot. He also waived all charges to court with the exception of the causing or risking catastrophe charge – which the district’s attorney’s office withdrew, according to Mr. Manko. One of&nbsp;Mr. Hatch’s attorney’s, Corey Day, said he’s satisfied with today’s outcome at the preliminary hearing in regards to the district attorney’s office withdrawing some charges. According to court documents, the district attorney’s office withdrew charges of riot - intent to commit felony and theft by unlawful taking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He’s obviously still pending trial, and we’re looking forward to that trial where we can try to address these many charges,” Mr. Day said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint, police reviewed video footage where they allege Mr. Hatch wore a Pittsburgh police orange life vest and used a metal pole from a construction sign to&nbsp;“smash&nbsp;the passenger side windows” of one of the unmarked police vehicles that was “equipped with lights and siren and very recognizable to be a police car.”</p>
<p>Police also say based on the video footage, Mr. Hatch allegedly took a yellowish brown liquid from another person who was pouring the liquid into the compartment of the car, and poured it onto a rag and “seconds later,” police say there is fire visible inside the passenger compartment and others are seen adding additional flammable materials. Police then say the vehicle was eventually “fully engulfed in flames.” Police say the total cost of the vehicle was $40,000&nbsp;“and is a total loss,” according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Connolly-Wack, 22, of Jefferson Hills, faces charges of riot, institutional vandalism and criminal mischief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When police reviewed video footage, they say a woman climbed on the hood of the police vehicle and began jumping up and down on the hood four times, which “smashed” the top of the hood, according to the complaint. Police say a crime analysts found a “matching description” of the suspect in a picture from a Facebook profile tag. Police also say they found a still photo from a street camera on Fifth Ave in Downtown that matched the same descriptions, including a tattoo on her chest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The preliminary hearing for Ms. Connolly-Wack has been postponed to Sept. 23 at the request of her attorneys, according to Mr. Manko.</p>
