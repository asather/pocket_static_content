<p>LANCASTER, Pa. â€”&nbsp;A judge imposed a 38- to 76-year prison sentence Friday on an elderly Amish man for years of sexually abusing four girls in a case that highlighted growing awareness of sexual abuse among Amish and related church groups.</p>
<p>"It is hard for me to imagine anything more offensive or evil than the conduct you have perpetrated," Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas Judge Dennis Reinaker told David Stoltzfus Smucker, 75, who sat without emotion in his wheelchair and declined to say anything in his defense. He was handcuffed and wheeled out by officers immediately at the end of the hearing.</p>
<p>Black-suited members of his church and family looked on from behind him, while across from him sat survivors of sexual abuse from Amish and Mennonite backgrounds who traveled from miles around for Smucker's judgment day.</p>
<p>Smucker <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/12/12/Coverings-Lancaster-County-Amish-David-Stoltzfus-Smucker-pleads-sex-abuse-assault-pre-teen-girls/stories/201912120110" target="_blank">pleaded no-contest in December</a> to 20 felony counts of sexually assaulting four young girls. The charges included rape, incest and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a child.</p>
<p>Smucker was arrested in March 2019. According to the charges, each of the victims was under age 10 when assaulted. Information presented in court Friday indicated the assaults began when the girls were 4 or 5.</p>
<p>His case was among several documented in 2019 in the <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coverings/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's series "Coverings," about sexual abuse in "Plain" Anabaptist communities</a> such as the Amish and Mennonites. The Lancaster County area is home to the nation's largest Amish community.</p>
<p>Asked if he wanted to say anything, Smucker shook his head slightly and said quietly, "No." Judge Reinaker said that unlike other Amish convicted of sexual abuse, Smucker denied his victims even the small healing gesture of taking responsibility for his actions.</p>
<p>One Amish man who observed the hearing said the community turned out on behalf of the "whole family," referring to the victims. "We support the court system," he said, declining to give his name.</p>
<p>Sources in the local Plain community said the girls are responding well to therapy but that, given the severity of the abuse and how long it occurred,&nbsp;if the children are to heal, it will take a long time.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Plain elders have often considered sexual abuse allegations as sins to be dealt with through internal church discipline rather than as crimes, with perpetrators who profess repentance being restored to their families -- leaving children vulnerable to further abuse.</p>
<p>In recent years, Lancaster County-area public officials and church elders said their communication has grown and that church leaders recognize the legal mandate to report child endangerment. Smucker's attorney, Christopher Sarno, said the Amish did the right thing in reporting Smucker to authorities.</p>
