<h1>Matt Vensel's Penguins chat transcript: 02.24.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Happy deadline day, Penguins fans! I'm set up here at the Primanti's at the airport to talk hockey with you guys until my flight leaves for LA. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I'm going to share my thoughts on the Patrick Marleau trade now and just get that out of the way. But feel free to send over any follow-ups. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: ICYMI, to get Marleau from SJ, the Pens sent a conditional third-round pick in 2021 that can become a second if they go all the way. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: When I first saw that Marleau is the forward the Pens targeted, my initial reaction was meh. Obviously, Marleau has had an amazing career and might even make it into the Hall of Fame someday. But he's 40 and the Pens will be his third team this year. I warmed up to the deal, though, on the way to the airport. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I was worried about his wheels at age 40 but by all accounts his speed is at least adequate. So it's encouraging that he will be able to keep up. Marleau put up 10 goals and 10 assists in 58 games for a disappointing Sharks team. So the production isn't great but the Pens won't be asking him to play a huge role offensively. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I'll be curious to see where he fits in. He is a left-shot who can play both center and left wing. He appears to be ticketed for a spot on the line not centered by Sid, Geno or Blueger. Right now, the fourth line is three guys who might not even dress in the playoffs. It will have a different look if they ever get healthy. But I also wouldn't rule out Marleau playing on Sid's or Geno's left wing if that clicks. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Also, he should help out their second power-play unit. I mean, right now they have Andrew Agozzino on it. So that's a bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Bill M.</strong>: Matt, thoughts on Pens acquiring a defenseman before the deadline.I believe there’s a hulking d-man on the Kings roster but his name escapes me. We need, in my opinion, at least one guy that can be considered a nuclear, albeit low-yield, option. I worry about be pushed around too much by the other Eastern contenders. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Bill, I agree that the Pens should try to add a defenseman but I don't know that they need or want a hulking one. They obviously need to defend better than they have since the All-Star break. If I were them, I'd try to add another left-handed defenseman for depth purposes. A Chad Ruhwedel type. They obviously don't have much faith in Juuso Riikola and there doesn't appear to be an alternative down in WBS. So if they can trade a late-round pick or a so-so prospect to add an insurance policy, I think they should try to do that. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: That way, their three LHD would ideally be Dumoulin, Pettersson and Johnson with a suitable lefty sitting up in the press box.</p>
<p><strong>Ln</strong>: You think they are done ? Are they still looking at Sheary ? Wouldn’t mind seeing if he still had chemistry with Sid <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: They might not make another move, but I doubt GMJR is done talking to teams about ways to get better. So stay tuned until 3 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>66fan</strong>: Marleau a depth player or Zucker experiment with Sid is already over? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I do not think the Zucker experiment is over. It's not like they've been bad. Zucker has three goals and five points in seven games. I just think Mike Sullivan and the Pens need to be patient. Now's not the time to start shaking up the lines, just because you've lost three in a row for the first time since October.</p>
<p><strong>James T.</strong>: Murry had been playing well recently, but just had a dud of an outing that arguably (and in his own words) cost the Pens a big game against a division rival. Do you think this has an impact going forward? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: James, I just wrote on Wednesday about how great their goaltending has been since the start of December. I'm not going to overreact to one less-than-stellar game by each goalie. Murray has played really well the last two months.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Do you think trying to get marleau a cup could be a distraction and added pressure ? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: They made a similar trade for Bill Guerin in 2009. Turned out OK.</p>
<p><strong>Rick</strong>: I like the trade for Marleau, but when do you think Coach Sullivan will pick one goalie and stick with him. It appears neither is benefiting from the every other game idea. Neither can get hot if you are going to sit the next game. I get that they have to play both, but a little more consistency would help. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Rick, until the last couple of games, both goalies had been playing really well. I think if one caught fire, Sullivan would ride that goalie. But recently, both have been consistently delivering B-plus performances. So he's giving them both opportunities and I think that's the right call. This decision will get sorted out on the ice. The playoffs are still six weeks away.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: I see they lost Agozzino on waivers, why did they send him threw? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I'm guessing that's a procedural thing that will make him available to WBS for their postseason should the Pens decide to send him down. If/when the Pens ever get healthy, I doubt he's going to play.</p>
<p><strong>burt reynolds</strong>: Was Riikola a healthy scratch yesterday, and was it because they felt Trotman might bring some more physical play vs the Caps? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Mike Sullivan said it was a coach's decision, I believe. And Trotman played Saturday, too. So they simply think he's a better option right now that Riikola. Which says a lot given they'd like to have lefty-righty pairings if they can swing it. Riikola has some tools but just hasn't been able to put it together the last couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>J</strong>: Looking at the prices paid for other quality forwards (Taylor Hall, Trocheck, possibly Kreider) do you think we spent our resources properly on Zucker? I get it that we can fit his salary under the cap, and he has term and those other guys might be hard to resign or fit under the cap. But in my mind, he’s a finisher. Zucker doesn’t seem to drive play. He’ll probably score 30 goals with Crosby, but I think Crosby is going to have to work harder to carry and keep the puck in the zone with Zucker on his line. I would have preferred a bit more muscle plus finish for the price. Thoughts on how this will age? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I liked the trade at the time and nothing that has transpired over the past couple of weeks has changed my mind. If anything, it's only made me feel better about Zucker's fit. Now, I'm not saying he's been great. It's clear he is still getting used to his new teammates, the system, Pittsburgh, being away from his kids, and on and on and on. But he's gotten a bunch of opportunities and cashed in a few of them. You kind of dismissed his goal-scoring ability in your question. Somebody has to put Sidney Crosby's passes into the net.</p>
<p><strong>GPT</strong>: Has Riikola done something terrible to Sullivan that we're not aware of? JJ is an anchor on Letang and every stat imaginable shows that. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Can we please give it a rest with the Jack Johnson thing? You realize Brian Dumoulin is hurt, right? The Penguins don't want to play Jack Johnson with Kris Letang but they don't have many alternatives. When Dumo returns, he'll skate with Letang and Jack will slot back into the proper spot in the lineup. But let's be clear: Jack is not a standout but he is by far a better player than Juuso Riikola. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Look, I think it's fair to criticize the Jack Johnson signing, especially given the term. But he's on the team now and Mike Sullivan and the Pens have to work with what they've got. Right now, they've got a depleted defensive corps. So Jack has to play a lot.</p>
<p><strong>MM</strong>: I would have like to see them pick up a younger wing with some “grit”. There are plenty of guys in the point range of what they got that could have given them a little physicality. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: MM, that's the course of action I thought they might take. But they instead prioritized adding another skilled forward, not that Marleau is a slouch in his own end. Even after trading away Joseph Blandisi, they do have some guys like that down in WBS if they really wanted a young guy to come in and skate fast in hard. I'm surprised we haven't seen Adam Johnson since early in the season, to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>66fan</strong>: it was refreshing to hear Murray actually take some responsibility yesterday but to me the breakaway was less of a problem than his inability to catch with the glove and control rebounds on the 3rd and 4th goals... these have been his issues since forever and they haven’t improved. throw in that he has never had a complete or solid regular season in his career. would you give him an 8 year deal? I say no considering they could keep Jarry for less <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: How about we worry about this one after the season, like the Pens plan to do? Much can be proved over the next three months. But I do get your hesitation about giving Murray a long-term, big-money deal. He's such a unique case without a comparable whose resume comes close to him, both in terms of postseason success but also, as you correctly note, streaky play during the regular season.</p>
<p><strong>Todd</strong>: Do you like where the Pens are at in the Metro? Even with the Islanders getting Parise just now and all the other moves the Metro teams have made. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Todd, that deal is not done yet but let's assume it does. I think that's a huge, telling move by our old friend Bill Guerin. I've always thought Zach Parise was a little overrated (good, but not great player). But I think he would be a good fit in the short term for the Islanders.</p>
<p><strong>Df</strong>: Questions coming in about the Zucker experiment being over???? He has 3 goals in 7 games. Meanwhile, Simon historically scores once per 10 games. And gets a free pass because he dumps pucks in with the best of them. Lol <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Poor, Dom. Just minding his own business and gets dragged again.</p>
<p><strong>Ireland4517</strong>: Once everyone is healthy (a huge assumption) how do you see the lines/D-pairings? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Dumoulin-Letang<br> Pettersson-Marino<br> Johnson-Schultz <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: OK, let's take a few minutes to regroup. I'm going to order a sandwich here at Primanti's while you guys think up more questions. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>Buskas #7</strong>: Matt - Aren't you glad we don't get to complain about Olli Maata? It's still one of the best days in recent Penguins history when we shipped him to Chicago for Kahun and a pick! <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Poor, Olli. Just minding his own business and gets dragged again.</p>
<p><strong>burt reynolds</strong>: Which player gets more undeserved ire from fans? Murray, Johnson, or Simon? Any who don't get enough? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Definitely Murray given his contributions to a pair of Cup winners. That doesn't mean you have to love him. And that doesn't mean you can't like Fleury more. But Murray gets treated like a total slappy when he is at worst, like, the 12th best goalie in the NHL. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Apparently, Andrew Agozzino has been claimed off waivers by Anaheim. So he won't be finishing the season in WBS.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmie</strong>: What accounts for Jack Johnson's amazing turn around this season? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Jimmie, I don't know that I'd call it an amazing turnaround. But he has been better, especially outside of a top-pairing role. He's talked about losing a little bulk in the offseason helping him move around a little bit better. I'm sure just more comfort in the system, the city, etc. is also a factor.</p>
<p><strong>Locante</strong>: What sandwich did you order? Also how do you think the pens will overcome their slump and division rivals? Metro teams are looking better and better as the playoff race heats up. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: You know, I'm going to sound like a bad Pittsburgher but whatever. I usually get a fish sandwich with no slaw because I love a good fish sandwich. But today I'm feeling frisky and decided to go with the sirloin steak and cheese with slaw. I'll let you know how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>rcc prof</strong>: I have 2 questions: 1. If the defensive corp is depleted as everyone recognizes, why did JR go after a 40 year old forward instead of a blue liner? 2. Why haven't the Pens just put Bjustad on IR and use his salary to get another blue liner? And please don't tell me he's coming back. Christmas may arrive before he's ready to play. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I feel like these are rhetorical questions so I'll just move on.</p>
<p><strong>Rory</strong>: With the Marleau signing, assuming all forwards are healthy with the exception of Guentz, how do you see the lines shaking up... <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: It's really hard to say at this point. But here's a blind guess:<br> <br> Zucker-Crosby-Simon<br> Kahun-Geno-Rust<br> Marleau-McCann-Hornqvist<br> ZAR-Blueger-Tanev<br> <br> But that leaves out Bjugtad, who is the wild card right now. It's fair to have low expectations for Bjugstad given his long layoff. But he could also end up playing a big role for this team in April.</p>
<p><strong>Ln</strong>: Wow if Guerin can unload Parise tip of cap to him ! <br> <strong>Steeler Fan Dan</strong>: Why can't broadcasters pick one, ZOO-KER or ZUCK-ER? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: It's apparently ZOO-KER but I keep saying ZUCK-ER. But in my defense, I mispronounce every name. I'm not playing favorites. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: The sandwich has arrived so this chat could get messy. Keep sending your questions over, though. I'll tackle the first half of this sandwich then resume chatting. I've got another 15 minutes or so before I have to wander over to my gate.</p>
<p><strong>Ireland4517</strong>: Airport fish sandwhich before a cross-country flight!?!? You like to live dangerously! Assuming all things stay equal in the goal tending department do you think there a strategic advantage to starting with Jarry and if that fails after a game or two you can fall back on the "proven commodity"? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: You can't spot any opponent a couple of games. So the Penguins have to decide which guy gives them the best chance to win and if that guy struggles they will switch. I don't see them yo-yoing goalies in the playoffs unless they absolutely have to.</p>
<p><strong>Locante</strong>: Who do you think will give the Pens the most trouble in the first round? Any team that the Pens should try to avoid? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I don't know that there's any team they should actively try to avoid. They're going to be getting a good team one way or another. The Metro is the best division in the league this season.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hi Matt - busy TDL so far today, you may have answered this already, but what is the most realistic best case scenario for Dumo and Marino? Do you think there's a chance one or both could play on the current road trip? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Hey, Sarah. Just reading tea leaves, I would be surprised if either guy plays on the trip. But practicing? We'll see. Practicing, obviously, would mean they aren't too, too far off. With Dumo, I'm guessing the Pens and he will both want him to get in multiple practices in a team setting before he returns, just given his long layoff. As for Marino, they'll want to play it safe with him. The good news is that he should be the same guy when he returns, unless there is a fear factor after getting drilled in the face. He seems like a pretty unflappable kid but you never know. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Any more questions before we call it a day? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: BTW, Mike DeFabo is all over the trade deadline for us today. Meanwhile, I'm eating sandwiches and doing crosswords on airplanes. Stick tap to Mike for doing the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><strong>Locante</strong>: Not a question, but I wanted to say thank you for taking the time to chat on what is surely a busy day! It's great to interact with a local sports writer. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Alright, that looks like it's it for today's chat. Thanks for joining me today. Enjoy deadline day and we'll do this again soon.</p>
