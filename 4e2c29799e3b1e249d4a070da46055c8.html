<h1>City launches housing resource website</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you are a renter seeking affordable housing or facing homelessness, a homeowner looking for a first house, or a landlord seeking guidance, the city has a new website to direct you to the program or person who can help.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/harp/" target="_blank">Housing Assistance Resource Portal</a>, which launched Thursday, screens website users based on need, age, income and ability to direct them to an appropriate online resource or phone number.</p>
<p>The site is a joint project between the city, the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Housing Authority, and includes resources from Allegheny County,&nbsp;Neighborhood Allies, the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Pittsburgh Housing Finance Agency.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto described the resource as “a one-stop shop for housing.”</p>
<p>“It’s&nbsp; something that I’ve asked for, for about 5 years,” he said by phone Wednesday. “During the pandemic, our team across multiple departments and authorities worked together to be able to help, no matter what you’re situation is.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The administration is awaiting city council approval for the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/28/City-plans-to-allocate-13-million-in-federal-funds-to-help-small-businesses-housing-and-food-pantries/stories/202004280080" target="_blank">allocation of roughly $13 million in federal funds</a> for community development and emergency housing.</p>
<p>About $2 million will be dedicated to the URA’s mortgage and rental programs for those facing economic hardship from COVID-19. Other housing services programs are also slated to receive funds, including $50,000 for NeighborWorks Foreclosure Prevention, $50,000 for the&nbsp;Women’s Center &amp; Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh, $40,000 for the Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations pre-court landlord-tenant/anti-eviction mediation, and $40,000 for&nbsp;Action Housing assistance to youths aging out of place.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2016/06/01/Affordable-Housing-Task-Force-create-10-million-Pittsburgh-housing-trust-fund/stories/201606010028" target="_blank">city faces a deficit of 17,000 affordable housing units</a>, according to a 2016 city-commissioned affordable housing task force report.</p>
<p>Majestic Lane, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff and chief equity officer, said the resource is&nbsp;“critical, especially in the time of this pandemic,” according to a Thursday press release.</p>
<p>Those outside of the city can contact the county’s Allegheny Link service at 1-866-730-2368.</p>
