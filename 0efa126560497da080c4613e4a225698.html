<h1>Penguins on pause: Why didn't Mike Sullivan play Juuso Riikola more often?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>For someone who has spent so much time up in the press box, Juuso Riikola sure has gotten a lot of support from paying customers the past two seasons.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old defenseman does have a few appealing qualities. Riikola is a plus skater. He has a cannon when given an opportunity to step into a slap shot. And who doesn’t love seeing a good hip check in today’s game? But one suspects the main selling point for most fans is that his name is not Jack Johnson.</p>
<p>As the old sports cliché goes, there’s no one in town more popular than the fourth left-handed defenseman on the depth chart. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, the opinion on the matter that carries the most weight belongs to Mike Sullivan. It is clear the Penguins coach has little confidence in Riikola.</p>
<p>Late in training camp, it looked as if Riikola might bump Johnson out of the top six. But Johnson held him off. Injuries gave Riikola opportunities to suit up. But he couldn’t stick in the lineup. It was telling that Sullivan in February opted to play Zach Trotman, a midseason call-up, on his off side over a healthy Riikola.</p>
<p>That had some wondering if Johnson had incriminating pictures of Sullivan or if Riikola had lost Sullivan’s cat. Why weren’t the Penguins playing Riikola?</p>
<p>The analytics crowd pointed to the best statistics publicly available as proof that Riikola should be in the lineup over Johnson, a popular piñata for statheads. To be fair, he tracked well. The Penguins generated 59.1% of the high-danger chances with Riikola on the ice at 5-on-5. That led all Pittsburgh defensemen.</p>
<p>But there is clearly a disconnect here, as Riikola played in just 36 of 69 games in his second NHL season, and a few were at forward when the Penguins got hammered by injuries early on. He had one goal, six assists and a plus-3 rating.</p>
<p>Sullivan has shed little insight on why the Penguins do not play him more.</p>
<p>Johnson, despite his flaws, is a trusted penalty killer and the team’s most physical blue-liner. Those are two reasons the Penguins play Johnson over Riikola, who has the skills to play on the second power play, but those skills aren’t needed when the Penguins have Kris Letang, Justin Schultz and John Marino available.</p>
<p>One suspects the coaches are also leery of Riikola’s brain lapses. He may not mess up as often as, say, Johnson. But when he does, he really makes it count.</p>
<p>Take the team’s 4-0 loss in Toronto on Feb. 20. With the Penguins down a pair of goals in the second period, Riikola drifted into no-man’s land as the Leafs were exiting their zone. All Riikola could do is flail his stick at a saucer pass after he let speedy Kaspari Kapanen sneak behind him for a killer breakaway goal.</p>
<p>After that, Riikola found himself back in the press box the next two games.</p>
<p>That sums up his experience here since he came over from Finland in 2018. Right or wrong, the Penguins just don’t seem to believe he is an NHL regular.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> We already pointed out a bad play that arguably defines his season. So we’ll go with a good one that gave a glimpse of what he could be if he ever figured it out. On Dec. 27 in Nashville, Riikola charged down the left wall, cut in on net and picked a corner on his rebound to score his only goal.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> Despite longer-term injuries to a bunch of blue-liners, Riikola has played just 73 of a possible 151 games the past two seasons.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> Riikola would remain a reserve. And even if there were an injury to a fellow lefty, one wonders if Sullivan and the Penguins would trust Riikola in a playoff game or would again turn to a righty such as Ruhwedel.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Riikola, whose salary this season is just $850,000, will be a restricted free agent this offseason. The Penguins can keep him if they want. If they opt to let him walk, it will be interesting to see if another NHL team envisions him as a regular and what he would do with his opportunity elsewhere.</p>
