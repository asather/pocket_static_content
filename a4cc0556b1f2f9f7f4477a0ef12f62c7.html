<h1>Ross police officer injured while thrown from theft suspect's car</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Ross police officer was injured Wednesday when, while reaching into a suspect’s car to turn it off, he was flung from the car after the driver reversed in an attempt to flee.</p>
<p>Ross police said Sabrina Eisenberg, 47, of Sharpsburg, was suspected of stealing eyeglass frames from America’s Best at The Block Northway mall shortly before 1 p.m.</p>
<p>When a patrol officer spotted Ms. Eisenberg’s car, a gray Ford Focus, and attempted to stop her, police said she fled onto Brown’s Lane, where her car left the road “at the top of the hill,” went into the front yard of a home, and struck a tree.</p>
<p>The officer made the decision to try to stop Ms. Eisenberg because he “feared for the safety of construction workers in the area ahead,” Ross police said in a release.</p>
<p>Police said Ms. Eisenberg reversed the car while the officer was reaching in, backed into a neighboring yard and struck a house.&nbsp;The officer, who was taken to the hospital and treated for an ankle injury, was thrown from the car in the process, police said. The officer’s identity has not been released.</p>
<p>Ms. Eisenberg had multiple outstanding warrants from other police agencies, according to Ross police. She is now facing charges from the theft,&nbsp;“as well as the flight and injuries she caused to the officer.”</p>
<p>Ms. Eisenberg was taken to the hospital after complaining of pain.</p>
