<h1>Steelers-Broncos: Brian Batko's Week 2 scouting report</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>When Broncos have the ball</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Key performers:</strong> QB Drew Lock, RB Melvin Gordon, WR Courtland Sutton, WR Jerry Jeudy, WR Tim Patrick, WR DaeSean Hamilton, TE Noah Fant, LT Garett Bolles, RT Elijah Wilkinson</p>
<p><strong>What’s been working:</strong> Dating to last season, once he became the starter, the Broncos have had success when Lock can be a game-manager. They’re 3-0 when the second-year quarterback throws fewer than 30 passes and 1-2 when he attempts more than 30. Not the largest sample size, but Lock’s consistency is the question. He was just 8 of 16 for 74 yards in the second half in Week 1, though he takes care of the ball and hasn’t thrown an interception in his last three games. Gordon also managed 5.2 yards per carry in his Denver debut.</p>
<p><strong>Who’s hot (or not):</strong> Jeudy, the 15th overall pick in April, looked like a rookie in his first taste of NFL action. He had four catches for 56 yards but also had two bad drops, including one in the fourth quarter. At 6-feet-1, 193 pounds, Jeudy is still a polished route-runner with good size and athleticism, but he’ll be looking to bounce back after a debut to forget. He’ll see a familiar face in the Steelers secondary in Minkah Fitzpatrick, his college teammate for a year at Alabama.</p>
<p><strong>Game plan:</strong> Offensive coordinator and former Giants head coach Pat Shurmur should study what his former team did Monday night that allowed them to counter an aggressive defense and have success against the Steelers. Some misdirection froze the front seven and allowed Saquon Barkley to produce a 38-yard catch-and-run, by far his biggest play of the game, and a well-timed deep shot off play-action resulted in a 41-yard touchdown pass. Getting Gordon going would also take pressure off Lock, whose favorite target could be Fant, a smooth tight end.</p>
<p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> The Giants offensive line struggled mightily with the likes of Cam Heyward, Bud Dupree and T.J. Watt, and while the Broncos should be more stout up front, they have some concerns. Center Lloyd Cushenberry is a rookie third-round pick out of LSU. Left tackle Garett Bolles has started every game since being a first-round pick in 2017, but the team declined his fifth-year option.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>When Steelers have the ball</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Key performers:</strong> DE Jurrell Casey, DE Shelby Harris, OLB Bradley Chubb, ILB Alexander Johnson, ILB Josey Jewell, CB Bryce Callahan, SS Kareem Jackson, FS Justin Simmons</p>
<p><strong>What’s been working:</strong> The Broncos allowed Derrick Henry to get over 100 yards in the opener, but he needed 31 carries to do it and averaged just 3.7 per attempt. They knocked down Ryan Tannehill five times, second-most in the league in Week 1, but only finished him off for one sack. So far, though, those are two good signs after the offseason acquisition of Casey, a five-time Pro Bowler when he was with Tennessee. They’ll need more from everyone with pass-rushing star Von Miller out for the year.</p>
<p><strong>Who’s hot (or not):</strong> Chubb was the fifth overall pick two years ago, one spot behind Denzel Ward and one spot ahead of Quenton Nelson, two Pro Bowlers. But after posting 12 sacks as a rookie, Chubb missed all but four games last year due to a season-ending knee injury, and his first game back wasn’t much to write home about. He played 73% of the defensive snaps but was credited with two quarterback hits, no tackles and no sacks.</p>
<p><strong>Game plan:</strong> Like the Giants, the Broncos run a 3-4 base defense and should be fairly stout up front. Also like the Giants, they’re dealing with injuries in their secondary, which makes it unclear how they’ll attack the Steelers offense. JuJu Smith-Schuster said he expected the Giants to play a lot of man defense with a single-high safety, but instead they saw more two Cover-2 defense with extra help over the top. That allowed Ben Roethlisberger to work easily underneath, but perhaps the Broncos will challenge him to throw deep more often.</p>
<p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> While Chubb gets most of the attention, No. 97 Jeremiah Attaochu is the edge-rusher who stepped up against the Titans, racking up four tackles, a sack and two quarterback hits. A journeyman since being a second-round pick in 2014, Attaochu picked up where he left off last season, finishing with 3.5 sacks over the final four games. Now he’ll face off against a reconstructed right side of the Steelers offensive line.</p>
<p><strong>Special teams</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers should be familiar with return man Diontae Spencer, who spent the preseason last year in Pittsburgh before being cut, then signed by Denver. The diminutive Spencer averaged 29.1 yards per kickoff return last year and also handles punts. … Veteran K Brandon McManus is as solid as they come, making all his kicks last week (two extra points) a year after hitting 29 of 34 field goals. … P Sam Martin put three of five punts inside the 20 and averaged 46.4 yards per kick. … Jacob Bobenmoyer is in his first season as the long-snapper.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Keys to victory</strong></span></p>
<p><em><strong>To win, the Broncos must…</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Avoid a rocky start.</strong> Traveling east from the mountains for a 1 p.m kickoff, there’s no time for sluggishness against a more experienced, more talented opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Find some nuggets.</strong> There aren’t a ton of obvious ways to move the ball against the Steelers defense, but a few big plays here and there to score or keep a drive alive can be an equalizer.</p>
<p><strong>Stop the avalanche.</strong> Last week showed that when the Steelers offense gets in a groove, it opens up pass-catchers over the middle as well as a ground game that needs to stay on track.</p>
<p><em><strong>To win, the Steelers must…</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Grab Gordon.</strong> It’s tough to draw up an encore after allowing just 29 yards rushing, but the recipe remains the same by taking away the lead back from a team that wants to establish the run.</p>
<p><strong>Key on Lock.</strong> If they take away the ground attack, the next step will be corralling another young quarterback and his cast of good-but-not-elite playmakers in the passing game.</p>
<p><strong>Back Ben.</strong> Roethlisberger found a rhythm eventually in his long-awaited return, but he’ll still need more from his running backs, receivers and especially a reshuffled offensive line.</p>
