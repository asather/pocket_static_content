<h1>'Complete control': White Sox pitcher Lucas Giolito tosses no-hitter against Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CHICAGO — In the second inning of the Pirates’ game against the White Sox on Tuesday night, the power went out for a moment. The scoreboards at Guaranteed Rate Field went black for a second, and the telecasts lost their feeds for longer than that.</p>
<p>Pirates fans may have been better off if the telecast had lost its feed for good.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of the game, the Pirates fought an uphill battle against White Sox right-hander Lucas Giolito. They didn’t get a runner on base until the fourth inning, when shortstop Erik Gonzalez walked. They only hit one ball hard all night: a Josh Bell line out to the shortstop.</p>
<p>The Pirates, more importantly, never got a hit. It took Giolito just 101 pitches to get 27 outs, recording the 304th no-hitter in MLB history and first in this pandemic-shortened season. The Pirates lost, 4-0.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen him a bunch of times, having been in the [AL] Central,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “By far the best I’ve seen him. Complete control. He threw a few sliders early and then was able to use it late, but the changeup was electric. He threw it both to his arm side and against his arm side. He threw it ahead in the count, behind in the count.</p>
<p>“It didn’t matter where we were at the order. He threw [Jarrod] Dyson a 3-1 one. Just really good stuff tonight. When you have the ability to go 95, which he did tonight, and then you come back and go 76, 77, 78 with probably one of the best changeups in the game — if not the best changeup in the game — it makes it difficult. He executed. You’ve got to give him a ton of credit.”</p>
<p>Giolito didn’t labor at all the entire night. He got into a three-ball count just three times, one being Gonzalez’s walk in the fourth. Truthfully, the closest the Pirates came to a hit was a weak groundball from left fielder Bryan Reynolds to the left of second base. White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson was in a shift on the other side of the bag and had to sprint forward, scoop it and make an athletic throw against his momentum to nab Reynolds at first.</p>
<p>All told, Giolito struck out 13 Pirates, throwing 74 strikes in his 101 pitches.</p>
<p>“He mixed a lot of pitches,” Gonzalez said. “He used the changeup a lot, too, and his fastball’s, like, 96-97. He pitched backwards. I think that was the key for him to control the game.”</p>
<p>It certainly didn’t help the Pirates’ cause that their own starter, left-hander Steven Brault, struggled from the jump. In the first inning, he walked two batters but sidestepped any damage in 21 pitches.</p>
<p>In the second, Brault wasn’t so fortunate. He gave up three runs to the tune of three singles, a walk and a hit batter. After that, he only lasted one more inning, allowing another run in the third and exiting shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Reliever Nick Tropeano made his Pirates debut after that and went four scoreless innings, but with Brault’s start and Giolito’s dominance, it was far too little too late.</p>
<p>Perhaps the event could have been predicted. Giolito had been very good this season, striking out 11.7 hitters per nine innings. Additionally, the Pirates were without two of their best hitters, with infielders Colin Moran and Kevin Newman on the shelf after suffering injury scares Sunday against the Milwaukee Brewers. Shelton said he didn’t consider using them as pinch hitters late in the game, given how things had gone to that point.</p>
<p>Still, the sheer ease with which Giolito dusted the Pirates away was staggering. The Pirates swung at 56 of his pitches and whiffed on an astounding 30 of them.</p>
<p>In the ninth inning, they sent center fielder Dyson to the plate first. He got into a 2-0 count, watched a strike, swung wildly at a breaking ball, then checked a swing but went around on a changeup.</p>
<p>Jose Osuna pinch-hit for catcher John Ryan Murphy and didn’t come close, swinging and missing on two straight pitches, watching ball one in the dirt and weakly fouling a pop fly down the right field line.</p>
<p>Down to their last out, Gonzalez, perhaps the Pirates’ hottest hitter through the first part of the season and the only one to get on base all night, didn’t stand a chance. He waved and missed at the first two pitches, then actually put a charge into one to right field. On this night, it wasn’t going to find the gap, as right fielder Lucas Engel raced under it and nabbed it, as the celebration was on for the White Sox.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you tip your cap,” Shelton said. “We saw one of the best pitchers in the game have a performance of a lifetime. You tip your cap. It’s a loss. I mean, if we go out and get beat 4-3, and we get 10 hits, we still lose. So we just have to move on and go tomorrow.”</p>
<p>With that, the Pirates could do nothing but walk back to their clubhouse. They had lost their 18th game of the season. For the wrong reasons, this one was more memorable than most.</p>
