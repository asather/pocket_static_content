<p><em>The Penguins took the ice on Tuesday afternoon in Toronto for their one and only tune-up before everything gets real. An early goal from Conor Sheary gave the Penguins the lead and a late tally from Jason Zucker forced overtime. But the Flyers were better in between and in overtime, earning a 3-2 victory that will eventually serve as a footnote in history during this strange moment in time.&nbsp;</em><em><br></em></p>
<p><strong>It was over when: </strong>After exchanging chances during a fast and loose 3-on-3 overtime, Flyers center Scott Laughton beat Tristan Jarry on a breakaway to end it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Turning point:&nbsp;</strong>With just under four minutes remaining, Zucker cleaned up Evgeni Malkin’s rebound to tie the score at 2. The late push gave hockey-hungry fans a few minutes of bonus action and showed a little bit of the scoring touch that can be expected from Malkin’s new linemate.&nbsp;</p>
