<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A New Kensington-Arnold School District employee has tested positive for COVID-19, the superintendent confirmed on Sunday.</p>
<p>The confirmation comes after the district Friday announced the spouse of a different employee tested positive for the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Both the employee and the other employee’s spouse were part of a school trip to New York City that ended March 8.</p>

<p>There were around 102 people on that trip, superintendent John Pallone said. It’s unknown if the two people who tested positive contracted the virus on that trip, Mr. Pallone said, especially since Monday marks the end of the virus’ two-week incubation period.</p>
<p>“We’re being as vigilant as we possibly can, as careful as we possibly can,” Mr. Pallone said.</p>
<p>The two individuals have been careful in keeping themselves and their families quarantined from the community, Mr. Pallone said.</p>
<p>The school district is in Westmoreland County, where there have been four confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date, according to the <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Health Department</a>.</p>
