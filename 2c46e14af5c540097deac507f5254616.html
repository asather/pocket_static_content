<h1>Penguins on pause: Anthony Angello made strides as a rookie but still has a ways to go</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>Anthony Angello’s rookie season began in Buffalo with a coach’s challenge.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-5 forward skated for the Penguins in the annual Prospects Challenge in Buffalo in September. He scored in the team’s first game but Mike Vellucci, the first-year coach for Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League, let him know afterward that he wanted to see more fire going forward.</p>
<p>Angello brought it in the final two games of that tournament and carried it over into the regular season for the AHL club. The 24-year-old had 16 goals and nine assists when he got called up to the NHL for the first time in late January.</p>
<p>Angello, a fifth-round pick in 2014 who played three seasons at the NCAA level at Cornell, feels he made strides down in Wilkes-Barre under Vellucci when it came to hitting smarter instead of harder and using his big frame to protect pucks.</p>
<p>But he did not make much of an impact at the NHL level as a rookie. Skating on the fourth line, he had one goal, no assists and a minus-1 rating in eight games. He never played more than seven and a half minutes in a game. He then suffered an upper-body injury March 3. That was the last time we saw him.</p>
<p>Still, coach Mike Sullivan said Angello showed he can be “an effective player in this league,” citing his size, skating and willingness to get in on the forecheck.</p>
<p>“It’s more about just decision-making, awareness, all of those things that players need to adjust to the pace of the game,” he said. “I don’t mean that physically. I mean how quickly players in this league process the game. [It’s] the anticipation skills and the awareness away from the puck and things of that nature.”</p>
<p>So Angello, one of the heaviest players on Pittsburgh’s roster at 210 pounds, has some intriguing tools. But he is still figuring out how to put them to use.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> Angello will have a heck of a story to tell his grandchildren someday. He was supposed to be a healthy scratch Feb. 18. But Evgeni Malkin was a last-minute scratch due to an illness, pushing Angello into the lineup. The rookie tipped a shot past Toronto’s Frederik Andersen for his first NHL goal.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> Angello dished out 13 hits in his limited minutes. That resulted in an average of 17.0 hits per 60 minutes of ice time, tops on the team. Brandon Tanev, who led the Penguins with 244 total hits, averaged 14.6.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> It would be in the best interest of both Angello and the Penguins if he finished out the season in Wilkes-Barre, helping the AHL club try to climb back into playoff position. Angello needs to play. And that wouldn’t happen here after the Penguins added three forwards at the NHL trade deadline.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Whenever the 2020-21 season starts up, Angello will get a chance in training camp and the preseason to earn a spot on the team. But he will have plenty of competition. Samuel Poulin and Nathan Legare, a pair of 2019 picks, may push him, along with Kasper Bjorkqvist, Sam Miletic and others.</p>
