<h1>Steelers make a statement on social injustice before Friday night scrimmage</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Early Friday morning, hours before the Steelers held a controlled scrimmage at Heinz Field, the team’s social justice committee met and decided action was needed in the wake of the recent shooting of Jacob Blake at the hands of police in Wisconsin. Just before 7 p.m., head coach Mike Tomlin made a statement that voiced their feelings on social injustice across the country.</p>
<p>“We thought the scrimmage was an opportunity to make a statement,” Tomlin said after the scrimmage that lasted less than an hour. “We felt like a statement was needed. We thought it was very necessary to make the statement we made. I was chosen to represent the feelings of the men, and I did so humbly.”</p>
<p>After the players were introduced and ran onto the field, Tomlin was handed a microphone and spoke for a couple of minutes as his players and coaching staff locked arms behind him. NBA and NHL teams halted their games this week in the wake of the unrest across the country. Some NFL teams canceled their practices in recent days, but the Steelers continued to practice and ended the week with the scrimmage.</p>
<p>Tomlin’s message since early in the summer has been that the team’s actions will speak more than their words. But on Friday night, Tomlin and his players believed it was necessary to let their feelings be known.</p>
<p>“We have social justice committees that are actively engaged in processes that we’re going to participate in — voter registration, police education, other things that put us out in the community,” Tomlin said. “But tonight, more than anything, we wanted to take the small platform that we have to state that we stand united with those who are suffering. We see them and hear them. Regardless of our privilege, we’re sensitive to the hurt and the pain and the struggle that is going on around us.”</p>
<p>Those on the field then gathered to pray for “betterment.”</p>
<p><strong>DeCastro injured</strong></p>
<p>Starting right guard Dave DeCastro was injured during the scrimmage and did not return. Tomlin said he is being evaluated, but he did not disclose the nature of the injury.</p>
<p>Others that did not participate in the scrimmage were safety Terrell Edmunds, Chris Wormley, Vance McDonald and Diontae Johnson.</p>
<p>Rookie guard Kevin Dotson, who suffered a knee injury last week, returned Friday and participated in the scrimmage.</p>
<p><strong>Still no decision at tackle</strong></p>
<p>Tomlin said the team is no closer to naming a starter at right tackle. Zach Banner and Chuks Okorafor continue to battle for the job, although Banner took the reps with the starters in the scrimmage, as shown on the team’s livestream.</p>
<p>“I don’t know that we have intentions of doing so,” Tomlin said. “Obviously we have to sort it out by game time. But there is no timetable from my perspective in naming a right tackle.”</p>
