<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On Easter Sunday in 2008, just before 10 p.m., authorities say James Garland Watts entered a home on Clairton’s Baker Avenue and shot Shawnta and David Lee.</p>
<p>The wife died shortly thereafter. David Lee survived, and he told authorities who shot them.</p>
<p>In the 12 years since, Watts has eluded capture. He’s the subject of&nbsp;“In Pursuit With John Walsh,” an Investigation Discovery program airing at 10 p.m. Wednesday, March 4<span class="comment" data-mce-mark="1">3/4</span>.</p>
<p>Callahan Walsh, John’s son and a co-host of the show, visited Clairton and Pittsburgh for the segment. It runs in the second half of the hour-long program and features interviews with friends, relatives, and federal and Allegheny County authorities.</p>
<p>In the segment, viewers are asked to be on the lookout for Watts. A confidential tip number is 1-833-378-7783 or at <a href="https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/crimefeed/id-shows/on-tv0/in-pursuit-with-john-walsh/in-pursuit-tips" target="_blank">InPursuitTips.com</a>.</p>
