<h1>Proposed Community Reinvestment Act changes have community groups concerned</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the 1980s, Ernie Hogan and neighborhood leaders from around Pittsburgh showed up at corporate headquarters of local banks, holding signs and presenting research about where lending was — and was not — taking place.</p>
<p>Protesters from Manchester, Bloomfield, Garfield, East Liberty and more, became known as “the school-bussed group” that took their message to Downtown and eventually got banks to the table, forming lending partnerships under the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“Most of these neighborhoods had one thing in common, and that’s that the banks weren’t investing. There was very little dollars going into these communities,” Mr. Hogan, now head of the Pittsburgh Community Reinvestment Group, said.</p>
<p>Now, local officials and neighborhood advocates say proposed changes to the Community Reinvestment Act could hurt low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and result in fewer loans and less investment in these communities — a loss of $1.3 billion over the next few years, some estimate.</p>
<p>Despite guidance from the U.S. Treasury encouraging flexible banking and lending in vulnerable communities as COVID-19 upends the economy, the Trump administration’s deadline for public comment on proposed rule changes is still slated for April 8.</p>
<p>The administration of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto has encouraged community groups to speak out about the proposal, noting in a letter the changes would “severely weaken the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)...The CRA has been integral in promoting the financial health of low-income and moderate-income communities, particularly communities[of] color by requiring banks to meet the credit needs of the local communities where they do business.”</p>
<p>“Right now we see CRA as a really important guideline that encourages investment in our neighborhoods,” said Majestic Lane, deputy chief of staff and chief equity officer for Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“The Community Reinvestment Act is pretty simple. It says that banks have an affirmative obligation to reinvest in areas or communities where they receive deposits,” Mr. Hogan said.</p>
<p>His organization and several others have since formed strong relationships with local banks that have established financial education centers and helped people gain better access to capital.</p>
<p>The proposed new rules could change how banks could earn their CRA ranking. Advocates fear that instead of being given credit for volunteer hours or investing in smaller projects, banks will have incentive to focus on large endeavors to meet proposed dollar-amount goals.</p>
<p>Mr. Hogan said he fears the days of “innovative” lending could disappear.</p>
<p>“Hey, maybe they went out of their comfort zone to do a grocery store in an underserved neighborhood where the market wasn’t as strong, but they did it,” he said.</p>
<p>Rick Swartz, executive director of the Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation, estimates that 30% of his operating budget would not exist without the CRA.</p>
<p>Several capital projects depend on it as well, he said.</p>
<p>PNC holds the mortgage on a 16-unit apartment building in the 5600 block of Penn Avenue that the community group is beginning to renovate.</p>
<p>Mr. Swartz said PNC “happily accepted” their application to refinance its $90,000 balance and issued a quarter of a million dollars in additional financing.</p>
<p>To reach the group’s $550,000 renovation goal, Mr. Swartz said the corporation will combine the private loan with funding from the city’s Urban Redevelopment Authority.</p>
<p>“There might have been a time when PNC Bank might have said ‘Well that project really isn’t large enough for us to devote the time and resources to making that loan happen and maybe you should talk to one of the smaller community banks,’” he said. “ … That was a time maybe not too far [in the past], maybe 15 years ago.”</p>
<p>Local bank lending has “stabilized” neighborhoods like Garfield and their representatives have spent hours leading community workshops — “a glimpse” into how banks have changed their behavior since the CRA was enacted.</p>
<p>“Banks can be major persuaders for people who might not realize there is an opportunity they can take advantage of,” he said.</p>
<p>Cathy Niederberger, head of PNC’s Community Development banking, said the proposed rule changes are a&nbsp;“mixed bag” of pros and cons.</p>
<p>She said the bank would&nbsp;“appreciate clarity” around what qualifies as CRA lending but shares concerns that smaller loans and community involvement would get&nbsp;“could get lost in CRA if you are only about the numbers.”</p>
<p>“The bank remains committed to all of our communities,” she said.&nbsp;“That may sound like PR, but it’s not.”</p>
<p><strong>Smaller communities may be affected</strong></p>
<p>While “fortified” markets, like Pittsburgh, may not see lending completely dry up under new rules, Mr. Swartz expressed concern for smaller communities and outlying areas.</p>
<p>“Funding for organizations like ours wouldn't exist without the CRA,” said Tracey Evans, executive director of the Wilkinsburg Community Development Corp.</p>
<p>Her organization is focused on economic development of the borough's central business district, and has spearheaded projects such as renovating the Lohr Building at the intersection of Wood Street and South Avenue, and the multi-million dollar restoration of the old Wilkinsburg Train Station.</p>
<p>Ms. Evans said her organization has good partnerships with a number of local banks, but funding for these kinds of projects or loans for small businesses in low-income communities can still be difficult to obtain. Ms. Evans fears it would be even harder without a strong CRA.</p>
<p>Dollar Bank, another active lender, declined to comment for this story, but The Pennsylvania Association of Community Bankers has expressed mixed feelings about the proposed changes.</p>
<p>The group described the risk of losing an emphasis on community volunteerism as the “antithesis to the very spirit of CRA and must be reconsidered.”</p>
<p>But the association sees some silver lining in updating the rules, particularly if the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency could work with community banks to help define investment opportunities, according to a letter the group submitted for public comment.</p>
<p>For example, “community banks endeavoring to fund projects that benefit entire communities, find that they will not receive CRA credit because it is not focused solely on a defined [low- to moderate-income area],” their letter states.</p>
<p>The association represents banks with less than $5 billion in assets, and in Western Pennsylvania includes Brentwood Bank, Farmers Building and Savings Bank, SSB, and Marquette Savings.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>Kevin Shrivers, the association’s president and CEO, said local investment will remain local for these banks, and that some modernization of CRA rules could be an “opportunity for community banks to demonstrate the value they deliver in their local hometowns.”</p>
<p>Mr. Swartz said he is now in talks with a local bank about financing the construction of single family homes on vacant land in the 5300 block of Hillcrest Street in Garfield.</p>
<p>He’s confident that he’ll find funding for the project, even if CRA were to be reformed in 2020.</p>
<p>“But another project like that two or three years from now, if the CRA were reformed the way the Trump administration would like to do it, yeah it could cause lenders to say ‘you know what, I just really can’t make the argument in-house of us to do that project,” he said.</p>
<p>In that case, he said, the Hillcrest lots would remain vacant.</p>
