<h1>2020 WPIAL girls basketball playoff forecast</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>CLASS 6A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:</strong> Ashleigh Connor, Mt. Lebanon (21.0); Lizzy Groetsch, North Allegheny (17.1); Maddie Dziezgowski, Bethel Park (16.7); Olivia Gribble, Norwin (16.3).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> Bethel Park first, North Allegheny second, Norwin third, Mt. Lebanon fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> North Allegheny. There’s not much separation between the top four teams. Any of them are capable of capturing the title. The Tigers, who have reached the final four years in a row, have been on a roll, winning eight straight and limiting seven of those opponents to fewer than 40 points. Groetsch is a talented 5-11 junior guard with Division I offers.</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong> Bethel Park has a strong one-two punch in Dziezgowski, a senior guard and St. Bonaventure recruit, and junior guard Olivia Westphal. ... Bethel Park and Mt. Lebanon split their regular-season meetings, as did Section 1 co-champs North Allegheny and Norwin. ... Connor is one of the WPIAL’s top sophomores. ... Norwin has an outstanding backcourt with Gribble and fellow senior Jayla Wehner. ... A dark horse team is Upper St. Clair, which starts three freshmen, but beat Mt. Lebanon and lost to Bethel Park by one point.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>CLASS 5A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:</strong> Kennedie Montue, Plum (22.1); Reilly Sunday, Moon (19.4); Aislin Malcolm, Chartiers Valley (17.0); Bella Pelaia, Mars (16.6).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> Chartiers Valley first, Woodland Hills second, Trinity third, Oakland Catholic fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> Chartiers Valley. The Colts (22-0) have won 52 games in a row (the WPIAL record is 56) and are the defending WPIAL and PIAA champions, so it’s pretty difficult to pick against them. Malcolm and Perri Page headline a group of four sophomore starters, and Duquesne recruit Megan McConnell (15.5 ppg) is one of the top point guards in the state.</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong> As good as Chartiers Valley is, the Colts are no lock. The other three teams from loaded Section 1 — Trinity, Thomas Jefferson and Moon — all pushed the Colts to the limit and are legitimate title contenders. ... A team to watch is Thomas Jefferson, the No. 6 seed, which lost to Chartiers Valley on a buzzer-beater. The teams could meet in the semifinals, which would be a title rematch. ... Trinity’s Riley DeRubbo (Fordham) and Mars’ Pelaia (Mount St. Mary’s) are Division I-bound seniors, as is Gateway 6-3 center Lexi Jackson (Kent State). ... Section 3 champion Woodland Hills is hunting for its first playoff win since 2010.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>CLASS 4A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:</strong> Mackenzie Amalia, Blackhawk (22.4); Christiane Frye, Central Valley (20.3); Jhayla Bray, McKeesport (18.0); Aayanni Hudson, New Castle (17.0).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> North Catholic first, Southmoreland second, Central Valley third, Blackhawk fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> North Catholic. As great as the Trojanettes have been over the years, they have never four-peated. That could soon change. Winners of a record 19 WPIAL titles, the Trojanettes (21-1) feature senior guards Tess Myers (Duquesne recruit) and Kylee Lewandowski (Richmond recruit). Myers is averaging a team-best 16.5 points a game. The team’s only loss was to Chartiers Valley.</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong> Exactly how good is Southmoreland? The Scotties received the No. 2 seed despite being 22-0. Their non-section schedule wasn’t strong and they have won only three playoff games this century. Sophomore Gracie Spadaro (16 ppg) leads the team in scoring. Their other top player is freshman Olivia Cernuto. ... Section 2 co-champions Central Valley and Blackhawk might serve as the biggest threats to North Catholic. They split their regular-season meetings. Amalia is a Robert Morris recruit and a terrific 3-point shooter. Blackhawk has won 12 of its last 13 games, and Central Valley seven of its last eight.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>CLASS 3A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:</strong> Nadia Lape, Mohawk (19.4); Bella Skobel, Charleroi (19.0); Karly McCutcheon, Mohawk (17.9); Kat Goetz, Avonworth (17.2).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> Beaver first, Mohawk second, Carlynton third, South Park fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> Mohawk is ready to claim its first WPIAL title. The Warriors are loaded at guard with Lape and McCutcheon, and average a Class 3A-best 64.9 points per game.</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong> Like Mohawk, Beaver and Avonworth are Section 1 teams talented enough to win the title. They have the two stingiest defenses in the class — Beaver (29.7 ppg) and Avonworth (33.2 ppg). Beaver guard Emma Pavelek (17.2 ppg) can take over games offensively. ... Carlynton began the season 4-7, but has won 10 of 11 behind the play of guard Jada Lee, a Mount St. Mary’s recruit who missed time with an injury.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>CLASS 2A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:</strong> Natalie Jasper, Ellis School (22.7); Nadia Moore, Winchester Thurston (21.2); Alyssa Pollice, Bishop Canevin (18.5); Sydney Payne, South Side Beaver (18.3).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> Serra Catholic first, Bishop Canevin second, Our Lady of the Sacred Heart third, Laurel fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> Bishop Canevin. The Crusaders are the pick to win a fourth title in five years. They have not lost to a Class 2A team and have a pair of star guards in Pollice and Diajha Allen (17.8 ppg), a St. Francis, Pa., signee.</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong>&nbsp;Serra Catholic is explosive offensively. The Eagles, led by forward Rayna Andrews (17.1 ppg), averaged 68 points during a recent nine-game winning streak. ... Defending champion Our Lady of the Sacred Heart claimed the Section 1 title and has won 14 of its last 15 games. ... If Winchester Thurston, the No. 9 seed, is healthy, the Bears can play with anybody. Moore, a freshman, ranks sixth in the WPIAL in scoring, but has missed the last five games.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>CLASS 1A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:</strong> Alexis Robison, Rochester (19.4); Jersey Wise, West Greene (18.5); Corynne Hauser, Rochester (16.1); Tara Lucot, Vincentian (16.0).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> Rochester first, West Greene second, Vincentian third, Clairton fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> Rochester. A year after winning their first WPIAL title, the Rams (21-1) have shown no let down, beating good teams from larger classes throughout the season. Robison and Hauser are a dynamic backcourt tandem, and 5-11 Jasmine Mack is a force down low.</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong> West Greene, runner-up the last two seasons, is 22-0 and a major threat to win its first title. Wise also averages 4.1 steals a game. ... Vincentian would love to get another shot at Rochester after falling to the Rams by three and seven points in section play. ... Clairton has won nine games in a row. ... No. 6 Sewickley Academy could be a sleeper. The Panthers have beaten Serra Catholic and Avonworth in the last week.</p>
