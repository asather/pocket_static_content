<h1>Man accused of damaging Pittsburgh police cruiser during protest pleads not guilty</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Shaler man accused of damaging a Pittsburgh police car during a May 30 protest in Downtown Pittsburgh entered a not guilty plea Tuesday by video in federal court.</p>
<p>Brian Bartels, 20, was indicted last week on a count of obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder.</p>
<p>Police and prosecutors said he spray painted an unoccupied police cruiser during a protest near PPG Paints Arena, smashed the windshield and enticed others to join in damaging the car.</p>
<p>The protesters were demonstrating against social injustice and racism in the wake of the death of&nbsp;George Floyd, who died while in the custody of Minneapolis officers.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office said Mr. Bartels went to the protest to instigate violence and was carrying rocks and spray paint in a backpack. Prosecutors said he admitted to police that he was the man in the video and that he was upset because of incidents of police abuse, according to the criminal complaint.</p>
