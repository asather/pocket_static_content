<h1>Shot-in-Pittsburgh Netflix series 'I Am Not Okay With This' adds teaser trailer</h1>

<p>A girl could learn to love a guy like Stanley. But Sydney might not be that girl.</p>
<p>In a new teaser trailer from Netflix’s upcoming series&nbsp;“I Am Not Okay With This,” endearingly awkward Stanley Barber, played by Wyatt Oleff (“It”, the “Guardians of the Galaxy” franchise) stops to offer neighbor Sydney (“Gretel &amp; Hansel’s” Sophia Lillis) a ride to high school in his junker of a car.</p>
<p>For Pittsburghers, the action speaks not so much about what happens, as to where. They’re in Brownsville, Fayette County, where many of the exteriors were shot when Netflix brought production here last summer.</p>
<p>The residential streets of Brownsville stand in for their neighborhood, while the exterior of the Westinghouse Arts Academy is their high school.</p>

<p>Press materials refer to Sydney, a girl with emerging&nbsp;“Carrie”-like powers, as a Pittsburgh teenager. Through seven, 30-minute episodes, they become better friends but Sydney isn’t certain of her feelings for Stanley. Well, that’s high school.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80244781" target="_blank">I Am Not Okay With This</a>” is directed by Jonathan Entwistle, whose&nbsp;“The End of the F***king World” won a Peabody Award. The series debuts Feb. 26.</p>
