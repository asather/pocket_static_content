<h1>U.S. judge rejects indicted drug rehab founder's request for release on virus claim</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A drug counselor, who federal agents allege was actually a drug dealer whose fentanyl and heroin resulted in usersâ€™ deaths, will not be released from the county jail pending his federal trial, regardless of the impact of COVID-19.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Joy Flowers Conti on Monday ruled that David Francis, 69, will remain locked up.</p>
<p>Francis, who founded Next Step Foundation in McKees Rocks, and his lawyer, Casey White, had argued that he should be released because of the virus. Many federal defendants in this region and across the country have been making similar arguments. Most here are being denied and so it was for Francis.</p>
<p>He said he should be freed because of his age and his health problems, including arthritis and Hepatitis C. He said he also needs a second hip replacement and argued that he's not a threat to anyone.</p>
<p>Jail inmates are particularly vulnerable to the virus, he said. As of last Wednesday, the Allegheny County Jail has seen four prisoners and a staffer contract COVID-19, and the jail has stopped lawyers from visiting inmates.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors opposed the release. They said that the danger Francis poses to the community outweighs his risk of contracting the disease in jail. To bolster that argument, they said that Francis is charged with delivering drugs that killed addicts and that he sold directly out of his home and business while pretending to be a drug counselor.</p>
<p>They also cited numerous other cases in which federal judges here have denied release to defendants trying to get out because of the virus.</p>
<p>In denying one request, U.S. District Judge Donetta Ambrose addressed the issue directly, saying if she let the defendant in her case go free then others "would flood the courts with similar requests."</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that releasing prisoners puts the public at risk and also overburdens the U.S. probation office that has to supervise them.</p>
<p>Judge Conti sided with the government on Francis. She said the jail is doing what it can to contain the virus and said there's no indication that he is not receiving appropriate care. Further, he's not indicated that he had any contact with the people who were infected.</p>
<p>"Speculation concerning possible future conditions does not constitute a 'compelling reason' for temporary release," the judge said. "The court concludes that the order detaining Francis remains appropriate. Temporary release of Francis is not warranted."</p>
<p>Mr. White said he respects the judge's order.</p>
<p>Francis has been in jail for more than two years following an investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
<p>Agents said he dealt heroin supplied by two New York sources, both of whom have pleaded guilty. During a previous detention hearing, law officers said they had known Francis was a major dealer because addicts who recovered from overdoses named him as their source.</p>
<p>Several did not recover; their deaths are the basis of two counts in the six-count indictment against him.</p>
<p>Francis originally founded Next Step Foundation as a nonprofit but in 2012 changed it to a for-profit called Next Step Recovery Housing. That was a deliberate move to shield his operation, agents said, because nonprofit drug centers get federal and state money and are thus subject to review.</p>
<p>Next Step Recovery Housing was little more than a drug den, agents said. A purported tax preparation business that Francis ran next door, All Personal Matters, was also a front for the drug operation, they said.</p>
<p>Both companies are shut down.</p>
<p>If he's convicted, Francis is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.</p>
