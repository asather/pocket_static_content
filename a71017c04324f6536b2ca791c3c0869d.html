<h1>PBT plans fan favorites, local premieres for 2020-21 season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Something old, something new and a few surprises are in store for Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s 2020-21 season. The lineup was announced Thursday during the opening night of its revival of Lew Christensen’s “Beauty and the Beast.”</p>
<p>The 51st season, which kicks off in October, is the last one planned by artistic director Terrence Orr. He announced last year that he’ll retire in June after leading the company for 23 years.</p>
<p>To help with a smooth transition for the next artistic director —&nbsp;who is expected to be hired this spring —&nbsp;Mr. Orr said he “tried to make it friendly and not do anything that’s really over the top, but there are new things for us.”</p>
<p>The season will open in October at Benedum Center with Kent Stowell’s “Cinderella” with the PBT Orchestra. This will be the first time the company has presented this adaptation of the rags-to-riches fairy tale. Audiences can expect striking backdrops and a fresh approach to its&nbsp;Prokofiev music, Mr. Orr said.</p>
<p>PBT will usher in the holidays with Mr. Orr’s “Nutcracker” with a Pittsburgh twist. People and props inspired by local lore, more than 150 whimsical costumes and Tchaikovsky's signature score will take over Benedum Center each weekend in December.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company will take on another new production in February 2021 when it stages Ronald Hynd’s&nbsp;“The Merry Widow” with the PBT Orchestra. The ballet chronicles the story of the debonair Count Danilo, who woos the wealthy widow Hanna Glawari so he can use her fortune to save his country. The romance and intrigue unfold within a Belle Epoque ballroom in Paris, set to Franz&nbsp;Lehár music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s got some incredible dancing roles for both men and women,” Mr. Orr said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April 2021, PBT will venture to the August Wilson African American Cultural Center for a mixed repertory program. In partnership with the center, PBT will mount&nbsp;“Maelstrom” (Beethoven’s “Ghost Trio”) by Mark Morris and Nacho Duato’s&nbsp;“Duende” (Debussy music). PBT danced the Morris work once before in February 2012.&nbsp;“Duende,” though, is a PBT premiere. The program will feature a live music component.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Both were on my original application 25 years ago to become artistic director of PBT. I wanted to be able to do their works,” Mr. Orr recalled.&nbsp;“I’m just being able to get the Nacho Duato [piece] so I’m very proud to be able to put that on there.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mixed repertory program also will include a third work that’s slated to be selected by the incoming artistic director.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The season will wrap up at Benedum Center in May 2021 with the return of a fan favorite, Derek Deane’s&nbsp;“Alice in Wonderland” (Tchaikovsky, with additional music by Carl Davis). It last appeared here in February 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single tickets start at $28 and will go on sale in August. Subscription packages start at $81 and are available at <a href="https://www.pbt.org/" target="_blank">pbt.org</a> or 412-454-9107.</p>
