<h1>Five questions Pitt faces as spring practice opens</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Four players transferred. Three with eligibility skipped the NFL draft. One gained a fifth year. A strength coach left and his replacement was hired. A possible 2021 starting quarterback transferred in from the Pac-12. Another graduate tight end entered the fold. The program was hit with minor NCAA violations, and there was speculation Pat Narduzzi might leave for the Big Ten.</p>
<p>Pitt’s offseason was hectic. But hey, football is back.</p>
<p>The Panthers will put a headline-filled couple months behind them as spring practice opens Monday. It will be the first of 15 practices, the last of which is Pitt’s Blue-Gold game on April 11 at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>In between now and then, plenty of questions will be asked about what lies ahead for Pitt football. Here are five we’re focusing on as the Panthers get going at their indoor facility on the South Side.</p>
<p><strong>1. What are the players’ expectations for this season?</strong></p>
<p>The last time reporters spoke to Jaylen Twyman, Paris Ford and Damar Hamlin was after the Quick Lane Bowl. Twyman declared he was forgoing the NFL after Pitt’s postseason win, but there was still a lot up in the air.</p>
<p>In the later weeks, though, when Ford and Patrick Jones II announced they were staying put and Hamlin was granted a fifth year of eligibility, the 2020 hype train started. Talk from fans of getting to 10 wins for the first time since 2009 ratcheted up. Ford tweeted about how he was excited to play behind Pitt’s defensive line, and Rashad Weaver returned the favor. There’s been an undeniable buzz.</p>
<p>When spring camp rolls around, optimism emanates from most college programs. But it’ll be interesting to see — when we talk to Twyman, Ford, Hamlin and those guys next — how they’re approaching this season, one that could turn out to be Narduzzi’s best in his Pitt tenure.</p>
<p>Are they putting a damper on the excitement? Are they lapping it up?</p>
<p>The season is far off. But the tone is set now.</p>
<p><strong>2. Who’s going to fill Ffrench’s PF Flyers?</strong></p>
<p>It’s easy to say Pitt has a trio of “starting” wide receivers returning — Taysir Mack, Shocky Jacques-Louis and Jared Wayne — and they will be the three first-team pass-catchers. But at this point, none are necessarily ideal for Maurice Ffrench’s vacated slot role.</p>
<p>Despite periodic snaps in the slot last season, Mack is better on the outside. Everyone saw his jump-ball, one-on-one ability at Penn State last September, and that skill wouldn’t get put to use in Ffrench’s old position. Wayne is a bigger body, and while that presents a favorable matchup against smaller nickel corners, the speed might not be there. Jacques-Louis, meanwhile, has the speed — but is he better utilized as a deep threat on the outside?</p>
<p>There’s a world in which Shocky snags the slot role. There’s also a world in which early enrollee Jordan Addison, a slot receiver in high school, gets the playbook down, looks comfortable in spring ball and enters fall camp with a chance.</p>
<p>“What attracted me to this offense is, the position I play, you have to have timing and patience. And in high school, we ran the same thing,” Addison said. “You had to create space. And I feel like I can be a big part of this offense.”</p>
<p>Addison’s involvement in spring ball could be an early indicator of whether or not that comes to fruition in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>3. What’s the deal at running back?</strong></p>
<p>Pitt owned a uniquely bad rushing attack last year. It was one of the few teams that not only refused to run it, but were terrible when it did.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Panthers ranked 100th in rushing attempts per game. And of the 30 FBS teams that ran the ball less frequently, only five averaged fewer yards per carry than the Panthers’ 3.5 per tote. That’s a problem with a tricky answer.</p>
<p>Is offensive coordinator Mark Whipple at fault? Or were Pitt’s running backs not good enough? Both can be true — and both need to improve. Only thing is, we don’t know which running back(s) will carry the mantle in 2020.</p>
<p>AJ Davis, Pitt’s leading rusher (127 carries, 530 yards), returns. So does rising sophomore Vincent Davis and redshirt junior Todd Sibley. And freshman Israel Abanikanda enrolled early. With V’Lique Carter transferring, those four — along with former four-star sophomore Daniel Carter, who played minimally at fullback in 2019 — will compete for snaps.</p>
<p>Generally, coaches learn far more from fall camp than they do spring ball. And running back is one of those positions that can be whittled down during full contact drills in the thick of August. But spring camp is still an opportunity for someone to stand out in a cluster of backs.</p>
<p><strong>4. What about linebacker and the offensive line?</strong></p>
<p>Again, a lot can change come fall camp. But it’ll be noteworthy how the Panthers line up at linebacker and O-line throughout spring ball.</p>
<p>The former sees a pair of starters depart. Saleem Brightwell, a knowledge middle linebacker, and Kylan Johnson, a blitzing bullet at “Money” outside linebacker, are out of eligibility. And Pitt returns three ’backers with starting experience: Phil Campbell, Cam Bright and Chase Pine.</p>
<p>Campbell and Bright worked in a “Star” linebacker tandem last season, while Pine spelled Johnson in 2019 and experienced life in the middle back in 2018. Linebackers coach Rob Harley also has Wendell Davis, SirVocea Dennis, Leslie Smith, Brandon George and Albert Tucker at his disposal.</p>
<p>Like the 2019 fall, Harley has to sort through a lot of different options. Thankfully for Dave Borbely, most of the offensive line is set. But one position on his front is in question: Right tackle.</p>
<p>I’d expect left tackle Carter Warren, left guard Bryce Hargrove, center Jimmy Morrissey and right guard Jake Kradel to reprise their starting roles in 2020. That leaves Gabe Houy, Carson Van Lynn and Jerry Drake to compete at the right anchor spot.</p>
<p>The starting job won’t be determined in spring. But much like running back, someone can impress enough entering summer and fall to stake an early claim on the gig.</p>
<p><strong>5. How are Weaver and Camp progressing?</strong></p>
<p>The answer to this question is less important now than it is come Sept. 5, 2020. Still, it’s something worth asking when the media meets with Narduzzi on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Projected starting defensive linemen Rashad Weaver and Keyshon Camp each suffered a torn ACL last August, ending their 2019 campaigns. The Panthers, of course, pushed on without them, tying SMU for the most sacks per game (3.92) at the FBS level.</p>
<p>But a lot of the defensive hype surrounding this team in 2020 is based on not only Ford, Twyman and Hamlin skipping the draft, but also the healthy return of Camp and Weaver. We’ll see where the pass rushers are in their recovery.</p>
