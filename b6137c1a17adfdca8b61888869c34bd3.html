<h1>Republicans vote down witnesses in Trump impeachment trial</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — One by one, senators rose at their desks on Friday to vote against calling any witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, effectively moving the trial to a close in the coming days.</p>
<p>The vote was 51-49, with Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah joining all 45 Democrats and two Independents in voting in favor of the measure. The rest of the Republican-controlled chamber stuck together to oppose it.</p>
<p>The consequential vote came after several hours of final pleas from House Democrats for key Republicans to reconsider. But after 36 hours of arguments, 16 hours of questioning and plenty of behind-the-scenes arm-twisting, senators ultimately sided with the White House lawyers and declined to expand the scope of the trial.</p>
<p>Without witnesses, the trial will move forward to deliberations and a final verdict. Mr. Trump almost certainly will be acquitted, as the vote to remove a president from office requires 67 senators.</p>
<p>After the vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called a recess and deliberated over dinner with Republican senators and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.</p>
<p>The plan that emerged: The Senate will take the weekend off, reconvene on Monday to give the senators floor to — finally — speak on the case. A final vote on the verdict is scheduled for Wednesday at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>That resolution mapping out the trial's conclusion was approved by a 53-47 vote, after the Senate voted down four amendments offered by Mr. Schumer to call specific witnesses and documents.</p>
<p>The Senate’s rejection of witnesses sunk House Democrats’ last hope to, in their view, show senators a fuller picture of Mr. Trump’s misdeeds. And it came hours after yet another disclosure from Mr. Trump’s former national security advisor, John Bolton, who Democrats have been seeking to call to testify.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolton’s upcoming book, called “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” reportedly details a direct demand by Mr. Trump that Mr. Bolton work to freeze nearly $400 million in military aid to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens.</p>
<p>On Friday, The New York Times reported that an Oval Office conversation occurred in early May and was attended by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who is leading Mr. Trump's defense in the impeachment trial.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s hold on the military aid to Ukraine, in addition to the delay of a White House meeting with its new president, was at the center of the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry last fall.</p>
<p>In December, the House voted to impeach Mr. Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.</p>
<p>Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who leads the team of six House Democrats prosecuting the case in the Senate, began his remarks with The New York Times report.</p>
<p>Mr. Cipollone “said all the facts should come out," Mr. Schiff said in the opening minutes. “Well, there's a new fact that indicates Mr. Cipollone were among those who were in the loop.”</p>
<p>Mr. Schiff, speaking for most of the two hours allotted to the Democratic team, portrayed witnesses as part of “any courtroom in America.”</p>
<p>Witnesses have been called in every prior Senate impeachment trial of both presidents and federal judges. The Senate called 41 witnesses in President Andrew Johnson’s trial and called three witnesses for private depositions in President Bill Clinton’s 1998 trial.</p>
<p>“The documents the president is hiding, the witnesses the president is concealing, will tell their stories — and we will be asked why we didn’t want to hear that information when we had the chance,” Mr. Schiff told the senators.</p>
<p>“The facts will come out in the end,” he said. “In all of their horror, they will come out.”</p>
<p>White House lawyers used a sliver of their allotted two hours on Friday. They have portrayed the House Democrats’ as weak and rushed through without the proper investigatory work required by a fair impeachment proceeding.</p>
<p>Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Mr. Trump, told senators a vote to call witnesses would needlessly prolong the trial for months. The White House would have likely demanded Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>“If we go down the road of witnesses, this is not a one-week process,” Mr. Sekulow said.</p>
<p>The witness vote took shape in the hours after senators concluded their questioning on Thursday.</p>
<p>When Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, announced her opposition Friday, the vote was all but dead. In her statement, Ms. Murkowski decried “a low point in division in this country” and said nothing any witness or new document would bring to the trial could change anybody's mind.</p>
<p>“Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,” Ms. Murkowski wrote. “I don’t believe the continuation of this process will change anything.”</p>
<p>“It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Ms. Murkowski joined Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., as the two swing votes who effectively prevented witnesses in the trial.</p>
<p>Mr. Alexander said he believed Mr. Trump committed the acts alleged by House Democrats but that they did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.</p>
<p>“It was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation,” Mr. Alexander said. “There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven.”</p>
<p>But he stated “the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year’s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania senators split on the Friday vote — as they have through the impeachment process.</p>
<p>Democrat Sen. Bob Casey voted for witnesses, while Republican Sen. Pat Toomey voted against the measure.</p>
<p>“The Senate must vote to hear from relevant witnesses and relevant documents to ensure a full and fair trial,” Mr. Casey wrote on Twitter moments before the vote. “Anything less is a cover-up.”</p>
<p>After the vote, Mr. Toomey reiterated what he had told reporters earlier. “The purpose of a witness is to shed light on an important fact that could resolve a disputed issue and help determine the final outcome of the case,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>“In my view, the House has brought forward articles of impeachment that do not justify removing President Trump from office, nullifying the results of the 2016 election, and denying Americans the right to vote for him in the next election,” he said.</p>
