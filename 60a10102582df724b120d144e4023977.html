<h1>Pennsylvania mask requirement applies to schools</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If students in Pennsylvania return to school in the fall, they will likely have to wear a mask for at least a portion of the day.</p>
<p>That’s because the order signed last week by state Secretary of Health Rachel Levine requiring individuals age 2 and older to wear face coverings in public places includes all K-12 schools.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“For the safety of students, staff and families, and to avoid community spread of COVID-19, students and staff are considered to be members of the public who are congregating in indoor locations,” the Pennsylvania Department of Education said Monday. “As such, they are required to adhere to this order.”</p>
<p>The health secretary’s order remains in effect until further notice, and health and safety plans that schools submit to the state before they reopen must reflect the order.</p>
<p>The order applies to individuals in public, private and parochial K-12 schools, brick and mortar and cyber charter schools, career and technical centers and intermediate units.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also applies to&nbsp;individuals in non-educational placements, such as residential facilities at boarding schools, detention centers and hospital settings, as well as state Pre-K Counts, Head Start programs and preschool early intervention programs, private academic nursery schools and locally funded pre-K activities.</p>
<p>The order, however, has some exceptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will be allowed to remove face coverings when at least six feet apart from each other while eating or drinking, at least six feet apart while seated at desks or work spaces, and at least six feet apart during activities, such as recess or mask breaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students who&nbsp;cannot wear a mask or face shield because of a medical condition, such as respiratory issue, a mental health condition or disability, and students who are unable to remove a mask without assistance are not required to wear face coverings.</p>
<p>Also, individuals who communicate with someone who is hearing impaired or has another disability where the ability to see the mouth is essential to communication are not required to wear a mask. The state, however, said those individuals should consider using another type of face covering, like a plastic shield.</p>
<p>Students are not required to provide evidence that they qualify for an exception.</p>
<p>Student athletes, coaches and spectators must wear face coverings during sports activities&nbsp;unless they are outdoors and can consistently remain at least six feet apart. Masks must be worn on the sidelines, in the dugout, and anytime social distancing is not possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Athletes, though, do not have to to wear face coverings while actively engaged in workouts and competition that prevent wearing them.</p>
<p>State Secretary of Education Pedro A. Rivera said <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/05/11/Pennsylvania-schools-reopening-fall-school-year-PA-Secretary-of-Education-Rivera/stories/202005110088" target="_blank">he expects schools to reopen</a> in some form in the fall despite the ongoing pandemic.</p>
