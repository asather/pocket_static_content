<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 01.30.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Zeise</strong>: OK sorry I‚Äôm late getting started - there will be bonus time at the end of it all!! Let‚Äôs get started</p>
<p><strong>rman</strong>: I think the Chiefs will win the Super Bowl 34-22 and Mahomes will be the MVP, What do ya think Paul? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I love Pat Mahomes. He is the best player in them <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I love Pat Mahomes but i think San Fran is a better team. Ill go with SF 31, KC 27</p>
<p><strong>Big Ben‚Äôs elbow</strong>: Hey Paul, I just wanted to start off saying, I really like your work here, and on the fan. With that said... How do you think the second round ouck will play out for ghe Steelers? Do you see them going OL, RB, or WR? I would like a skill player. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think it will be best available player who is a tight end or offensive lineman. Those are two glaring needs. I cant see them taking a running back. They already have too many on the roster.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: In todays sports world the only way someone goes from below average to good or even great is usually chemically induced. So assuming Jack Johnson isn‚Äôt on the sauce how can you possibly explain his turnaround. Yes I get he‚Äôs playing with Letang, but he actually looks faster, shot is more accurate and he is moving the puck! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I just think he has settled in, has grown more comfortable with his role and now understands exactly what is expected of hum and how Mike Sullivan wants him to play. When you play smarter, you play faster.</p>
<p><strong>Waz Khalifa</strong>: Paul, first off, nice work. I feel there is not enough chatter for Hines Ward to become a HOF candidate. I get there is ‚ÄúSteelers fatigue‚Äù by voters regarding our boys, but HInes with compiling 1000 receptions on a mostly run first, ball control offense for the first half of his career is impressive. Add on the 3 SB appearances(2 wins), as well as the MVP and being arguably the best blocking WR ever, you‚Äôve got an easy choice. Also could throw, did some kick returns, he was a Swiss Army knife all with a smile on that enthusiastic face! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Im not in the camp of Hines Ward for HOF. I think he was a great player, a great Steeler but he was often not even the best receiver on his own team and im not sure was ever one of the five best in the NFL. He is iust outside a Hall of Famer in my book.</p>
<p><strong>AA</strong>: Do you think most fans have expectations for backup QBs that are unrealistic? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Absolutely. There is no chance they can affford most of the names being thrown around. They pay $36 million or whatever to their starter. That doesnt leave a lot for the backup spot</p>
<p><strong>Baghdad_Ben</strong>: Is it safe to now say that Kevin Colbert ‚Äúfleeced‚Äù Mike Mayock in the Antonio Brown trade? Reporting at the time gave a different story but I think Colbert is due some credit, whether the move was by plan or not. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They knew they were getting rid of a huge pain in the aas. So I think he won the trade the day he got rid of AB. Seriously, the return almost didnt matter and consider what they got, yeah Colbert won big time</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Paul, With the Sanders comments about Ben it is pretty clear why he has not been voted team MVP more often. Where has he matured in the later years. Quit being about me and more the team I guess? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It has never been a secret that Ben is not or at least has not been very popular in the locker room. He was clearly an immature and self centered jerk when he first came into the league. It seems like he has matured some since the Georgia incident and he has made an effort to be a better teammate - but the fact he has never been voted team MVP speaks volumes about how far he still has to go to win that locker room over</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: All the people who want the Steelers to sign a vet FA QB AND sign Dupree don‚Äôt understand they don‚Äôt have the cap space to do both witho cutting a bunch of guys. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They are going to cut a bunch of guys - but not to make room for a backup QB. They need to sign Bud Dupree and shore up a few other spots</p>

<p><strong>pP</strong>: Final Super Bowl score 4-2 (OT)üòú <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: So you have the under?</p>
<p><strong>Georgia fan of all Pitt teams</strong>: Paul. Do you see any silver lining in the Buccos Clouded future ? And has there been any information about Ben‚Äôs elbow and his recovery. Go Pens and Lincoln Park. thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The Pirates new front office has a plan. That is a good start. Now as I wrote the other day, none of it matters if Bob Nutting isnt willing to spend money when they get close to contending again we are all wasting time. Unfortunately, we wont know that answer until that time comes. As for Ben, all indications ae that he is on track and on schedule</p>
<p><strong>D1J1</strong>: You are the Bucco‚Äôs GM, you are getting inquiries for both Bell and Frazier. Do you move either or both now or later? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: If the offers are right it is a no brainer - trade them now. But only if the offers make sense and are going to help the Pirates resot <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: restock their minor league system with talented young players</p>
<p><strong>Mike </strong>: Paul, do you see the Pirates making any additional trades before the start of the regular season? I would not be shocked if they traded Archer, Kela or Bell or some combination of all of them. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think Chris Archer and Keone Kela will be far more valuable as trade chips at the trade deadline so id expext them to start the season with the Pirates. Bell could be traded if someone makes a really good offer for him but they aren‚Äôt yet feeling the pressure to move him. I suppose if someone was Frazier that is possible tol <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: too</p>
<p><strong>Tim fromTyrone</strong>: Hi Paul. I enjoy listening to you. You do not hold back. You tell the truth. The Steelers must take care of the offensive line before anything else. We are going to have a 38 year old quarterback behind center which isn‚Äôt very mobile. What do you think.. Thank You. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I agree - like i said they need to use their first pick (which is a 2nd round pick) on either tight end or offensive line. They need to make the team around Ben better than it is.</p>
<p><strong>Lou</strong>: I‚Äôm hearing that a two year strike will be coming after the 2020 season. I think the NFL is too hot right now for that to happen...thoughts? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I doubt that considering there are reports the union is voting on the current proposal by the owners and could have an agreement this week.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: With the Dukes‚Äô loss to Dayton, do you see any of the local teams going to March Madness this year? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think Duquesne is a year away. Robert Morris is a legit threat to win the NEC. Pitt has an outside shot. I think RMU makes it the other two do not</p>
<p><strong>OU812</strong>: Does Pitt make the NIT? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think they have a shot at an NCAA bid but the NIT is much more realistic. And I think that is where they end up.</p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: Will the Pens be flat after the extended layoff for tomorrow‚Äôs game? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don‚Äôt think so. This is a team that seems to love to play. They seem to love to play with each other. They bring spirit and energy almost every night. I expect them to come out and play a sharp, crisp game and win</p>
<p><strong>RG</strong>: Hi Paul - if by chance the Pens would stand pat trade-wise (which by all accounts will NOT be the case), is this team a true Cup contender as is? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Absolutely. I think they are clearly one of the best teams in the NHL.</p>
<p><strong>Mike </strong>: Paul, I told someone last week that the Pirates would unload Marte after pirates fest in order to avoid any bad publicity over the move. I don‚Äôt disagree with the trade but it is such a classic Nutting move. it is right up there with how they have made past announcements at Thanksgiving or Christmas when no one is paying attention. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I do not think that was a factor. I think they were trying to get the best deal possible for him and the Diamondbacks came through. The fact that it was after Piratefest was coincince and nothing more</p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: The next news on AB will be A. He meets w/ a NFL team. B. He is arrested again. C. Updates on his court date D. Enters hospital. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: E He says something idiotic or outrageous on social media</p>
<p><strong>New castle pete</strong>: Do uou think Duck will be back to the Steelers or do you think think he will play where he was drafted in Canada. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think he will be a Steeler all the way through training camp but wont make the team</p>
<p><strong>AA</strong>: What Steeler is HOF elig that you think sh be in and is not? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Bill Nunn and LC Greenwood</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: How many will the Pirates cry ‚ÄúWOLF‚Äù or in their case ‚ÄúSMALL MARKET‚Äù team before fans stop going to games? New management team, same old excuses! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The Pirates can do better than they do in the payroll department. That doesnt mean that there arent legitimate economic restraints on them and that they are always lying when rhey say they cant soen <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: spend more money</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Paul, Any news on hiring a WR coach? Maybe they have their eye on a KC or S F assistant? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Nothing yet, i would expect that to be filled after the Super Bowl</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong>: Is ‚Äúmoving forward‚Äù the biggest cliche in interviews, etc right now? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No ‚Äúculture‚Äù is.....</p>
<p><strong>AA</strong>: I agree on Nunn and Greenwood. I don‚Äôt think Russell is a Hall of Famer and Ward isn‚Äôt really either, as much as I like him. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would absolutely agree on all counts <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: OK it has been fun but we are done! Lets do it again next Thursday. Thanks for participating and tell your friends to join us too!!!</p>
