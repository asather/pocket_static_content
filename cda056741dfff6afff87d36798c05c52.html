<h1>YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh cuts staff, imposes pay reductions to counter revenue drop during pandemic </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh on Wednesday laid off 30 people, mainly from the organization’s administration office, and imposed pay cuts ranging from 5% to 25% for some remaining staff as it attempts to restructure operations that have taken a dramatic hit during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“This is so incredibly frustrating for all of us, meaning staff, volunteers and our stakeholders,” said Kevin Bolding, president and chief executive.</p>
<p>“Now we have an organization that has to reinvent itself.”</p>
<p>The nonprofit expects its operating budget to fall from $34 million last year to $19 million in the current fiscal year that began April 1, largely due to a decline in revenues from its fitness facilities, child care programs and camps that were forced to close in March when the pandemic struck the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>Some of the YMCA’s eight branches have reopened, but attendance at fitness facilities has been low and enrollment in child care centers is also down because many parents are working from home, Mr. Bolding said.</p>
<p>Prior to government-ordered shutdowns, the YMCA had about 1,000 to 1,100 full- and part-time employees, he said.</p>
<p>Following Wednesday’s layoffs, employment stands at less than 400.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those laid off Wednesday were primarily full-time workers at the YMCA’s main office in Foster Plaza, Green Tree, whose jobs supported programs and activities at its branches.&nbsp;The cuts had “very little impact” on people who work at the branches, Mr. Bolding said.</p>
<p>The layoffs Wednesday will generate $1.7 million in annualized savings, according to Mr. Bolding, with 63% of that coming from cuts made at the YMCA's main office.</p>
<p>Some part-time employees were furloughed in March when the facilities closed.</p>
<p>Some of them returned over the summer to staff camps and child care centers, while others returned recently to staff school-related programs, he said.</p>
<p>The laid off employees “did nothing wrong,” said Mr. Bolding.</p>
<p>“The really frustrating thing is that they have rolled up their sleeves and thought creatively about how to operate in the COVID-19 world. They’ve created magic out of dust. These aren’t just our peers. They are friends and colleagues.”</p>
<p>Those who will take pay cuts are employees making $50,000 or more annually.</p>
<p>The reductions are 5% for those earning $50,000 to $74,999; 10% for those earning $75,000 to $100,000; 15% for those earning $100,000 to $150,000; and 20% for those earning $150,000 or more.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolding’s pay will be cut by 25%, he said.</p>
<p>He and other executives took pay cuts ranging from 10% to 75% in the early weeks of the pandemic, but their salaries were fully restored after the YMCA received a Paycheck Protection Program loan of just under $2 million.</p>
<p>PPP loans were available to small businesses and nonprofits under the federal stimulus package known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.</p>
<p>Of the YMCA’s eight branches, five have reopened, including Baierl Family YMCA, Franklin Park; Sampson Family YMCA, Plum; Spencer Family YMCA, Bethel Park; Thelma Lovette YMCA, Hill District; and Allegheny YMCA, North Side.</p>
<p>The branch in the U.S. Steel Tower, Downtown, reopened, but with attendance averaging fewer than 25 members a day, it closed again after three weeks, said Mr. Bolding.</p>
<p>“There’s nobody Downtown,” he said.</p>
<p>The Homewood-Brushton YMCA and the North Boroughs branch in Bellevue also remain closed, although the Homewood-Brushton site has been used for food distribution, tax preparation, and summer and after-school camps.</p>
<p>The COVID-19-related cuts at the YMCA come as the organization was beginning to stabilize after a turbulent time for the nonprofit that included a Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closures of several facilities, including the Downtown Y in Market Square.</p>
<p>When the pandemic forced closures in March, the nonprofit was wrapping up its fiscal year with a positive cash flow of $600,000 —&nbsp;one of its most successful financial performances in 25 years, said Mr. Bolding.</p>
<p>When staff made the decision to close facilities in March, “We knew it would be a tremendous uphill road coming back,” he said. “And that definitely played out.”</p>
<p>Going forward, the YMCA will “recalibrate the organization to the size of our revenues going forward,” said Mr. Bolding.&nbsp;Remaining staff in administration will “start to take on dual hats in many ways,” he said.</p>
<p>His goal is to “make the changes we need to make so we don’t go through this again.”</p>
<p>The YMCA has received strong support from foundations as it weathered its bankruptcy and the pandemic, Mr. Bolding said, and continues to garner support from members, volunteers and individual donors.</p>
<p>It has held a couple virtual fundraisers during the pandemic and will partner with P3R, the organization that operates the Pittsburgh Marathon and other races, to hold a virtual Thanksgiving Day Turkey Trot.</p>
<p>“We’re going to get through this,” said Mr. Bolding. “Part of the strategy is just saying we don’t have expectations that [COVID-19] is ending in six to 12 months. We want to navigate the next 24, 36 or 48 months to make sure the organization is built to last, not just built to get through.”</p>
