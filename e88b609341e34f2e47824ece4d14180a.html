<h1>Traffic deaths declined for the third year in a row in 2019, NHTSA says</h1>

<p>Traffic deaths across the country dropped for the third year in a row in 2019 and could be the second lowest death rate per miles traveled since the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began keeping records in 1975, the agency said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Preliminary numbers in a statistical projection estimate 36,120 people died in road crashes last year. That is a decrease of about 440 or 1.2% less than 2018.</p>
<p>Although vehicle miles traveled increased by 0.9%, the fatality rate per 100 million miles traveled dropped to 1.10, down from 1.13. If that rate holds in a final review of statistics, it would be the second lowest rate since 1975.</p>
<p>Deaths were down in many categories: drivers, -3%; passengers, -4%;&nbsp; motorcyclists, -1%; pedestrians, -2%; and bicyclists, -3 %.The agency is projecting increases of about 1% each in deaths involving at least one large truck and drivers 65 or older.</p>
<p>“Safety is our top priority so this report that traffic fatalities appear to have decreased again for the third year is great news,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao said in a news release.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Governors Highway Safety Association lauded the numbers but urged motorists to remain vigilant.</p>
<p>“This is good news, but clearly much work remains,” Executive Director Jonathan Adkins said in a news release. “Tens of thousands of our family members and friends continue to be killed on our nation’s roads. We must do much more to ensure we all arrive at our destination safely.”</p>
<p>The agency reported last month its concern that police across the country have reported an increase in speeding as a result of reduced traffic during stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 virus. Mr. Adkins said motorists must be careful as those orders are lifted.</p>
<p>“Now, as states begin to reopen businesses and drivers resume their normal patterns, pent up demand could lead to an increase in crashes,” he said.&nbsp;“Americans, no doubt, are anxious to return to work, visit with friends and families, and socialize at restaurants and bars. When they do, they must extend the same care and focus on safety that has been exhibited throughout the pandemic to our roadways.”</p>
