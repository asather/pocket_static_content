<h1>Pitt's Justin Champagnie on his impact: 'This is what I planned to do'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When it looked as though Justin Champagnie’s freshman season at Pitt may have been over before it could even begin —&nbsp;the unfortunate result of a September knee injury&nbsp;— he remained calm, even as others around him didn’t.</p>
<p>Initial fears were that he had torn an ACL, something that would have kept him out any number of months and prompted questions as to whether he should explore redshirting. Through all those doubts and all that anxiety, Champagnie was resolute, even going so far as to tell Panthers coach Jeff Capel the day after he got hurt that he was going to play this year.</p>
<p>“The injury did look bad, but I just always kept faith that I was going to play,” Champagnie said. “I never got down on myself. I just worked to get back to where I am now.”</p>
<p>The injury turned out to merely be a sprain. Thankfully for his team, Champagnie was right.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-6 freshman forward has been every bit the immediate contributor coaches and teammates said he could be. As Pitt prepares for its game Saturday against North Carolina, Champagnie leads the team in rebounding — with seven per game, 2.2 more than his next-closest teammate — and is third in scoring, at 11.4 points per game. The first time the Panthers played the Tar Heels, a 73-65 road victory Jan. 8, he scored 22 points, pulled down eight rebounds and drained four of his seven 3-pointers.</p>
<p>To him, there’s nothing particularly revelatory about what has transpired over the past two months. It’s merely been the plan working out as he believed it could.</p>
<p>“I haven’t surprised myself,” Champagnie said Thursday. “This is what I planned to do. I planned to come in and make an immediate impact for the team to help us win games. I’m just confident in my game and confident in what I do.”</p>
<p>Over the past six games, four of which have come against ACC opponents, Champagnie has seen his role increase even more. In that time, he has averaged 14.5 points and nine rebounds per game while logging an average of 37.3 minutes (of a possible 40).</p>
<p>Even in his initial days on campus, teammates saw a player who had the potential to be helpful this season, maybe even special over a longer period of time. Sophomore guard Trey McGowens recalled Champagnie making tough shots and showcasing offensive moves in pickup games over the summer that added to the perception Pitt players already had that their new teammate was an exemplary athlete.</p>
<p>Champagnie has exhibited that in many of the Panthers’ first 17 games, impacting the game in any number of ways and making plays that are often seen from more seasoned players. Along the way, he has had support from players such as McGowens and Xavier Johnson who, while only sophomores, know what it’s like to be a freshman upon whom their team counts.</p>
<p>“Honestly, just be the best version of you,” McGowens said of the advice he gives to Champagnie. “Don’t worry about anything else, stats or none of that. Just do whatever this team needs you to do and whatever you can do to the best of your ability.”</p>
<p>Within Champagnie is a certain confidence he attributes to his parents, Ranford and Christina, and his upbringing in Brooklyn. It’s something that helps keep him afloat in the moments that could threaten to overwhelm other freshmen, like the number of times this season he has had a poor shooting game.</p>
<p>That belief in himself isn’t off-putting; if anything, it’s subtly exuded, though it has shown itself in critical moments, like when he made four 3s in 3:52 in the second half against North Carolina or made a pair of free throws in the final 40 seconds of overtime to keep his team alive in what ended up being a five-point loss to Louisville.</p>
<p>“It’s basically do or die,” Champagnie said. “I love winning and I hate the feeling of losing. If I want to win, I’ve got to step up and make big plays, even at a young age.”</p>
<p>He’s not the only member of his family who has asserted themselves in college basketball this season. His twin brother, Julian, is a freshman at St. John’s who is averaging 8.8 points and 5.9 rebounds per game for the Red Storm (Pitt was among his finalists in his recruitment).</p>
<p>Champagnie said he and his brother communicate daily. On Wednesday, Champagnie said he sent his brother each of their stat lines and told him to “just pick it up, just to be better,” the kind of ribbing that’s common in the twins’ friendly, ongoing competition with each other.</p>
<p>“We always talk about what happens if we played each other one day. We’re going to win, but…” Champagnie said before trailing off.</p>
<p>Has he talked to Capel — who has stated in the past <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2018/11/20/pitt-panthers-basketball-acc-saint-louis-jeff-capel-new-york-brooklyn/stories/201811200101" target="_blank">a desire to try to participate in games</a> in the New York area against former Big East foes — about trying to arrange that matchup?</p>
<p>“I’m trying to,” Champagnie said, smiling.</p>
