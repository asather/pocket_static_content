<h1>Us: Feed the Hood founder nourishes body and soul</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Each of us has a story. This one made our website. To suggest someone for the Us column, which runs every Monday, email uscolumn@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p>White pieces of tissue dissolved on my tongue as I picked apart the napkins and ate them one ply at a time.</p>
<p>Yes, I used to eat tissue in the early years of my childhood, but please don’t judge me. Let’s just say that a brief cycle of moving through abusive homes in Tennessee’s foster care system taught me early in life how to survive and be resourceful. Donated canned goods were also a staple of my poor diet as a child.</p>
<p>When you’re desperate, healthy food isn’t exactly a priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carlos Thomas, 29, grew up in Homewood and knows what I mean. It’s the main reason he founded Feed the Hood in 2016.</p>
<p>“I grew up poor, so I know how it feels to be hungry. That’s why I became a chef, ” said Mr. Thomas, who still lives in Homewood.</p>
<p>Yet he also had family who knew the importance of nutrition — his grandmother, Irene Abbey, and an uncle, the Rev. Leonard T. Jones, pastor of Missionary Temple Ministries, which started in the Hill District and is now in East Liberty.</p>
<p>“My grandmother taught me not to waste food,” Carlos said.&nbsp;“I also remember in church growing up, my uncle always brought us vegetables like corn, peppers, squash and zucchini, so I was kind of exposed to more healthy foods early.”</p>
<p>I met Carlos a year ago while working on a story. As we sat inside Zeke’s Coffee shop in East Liberty,&nbsp;I was blown away by his passion for food service and knowledge of food insecurity issues.</p>
<p>Most striking was his emphasis on the importance of getting healthy, nutritious food to those who need it, people who are used to eating the canned and processed foods we are quick to donate. There was such intention and responsibility behind his passion that I couldn’t help but be impressed.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh is one the nation’s top food deserts, according to Just Harvest, a nonprofit based on the South Side. About a third of the city’s neighborhoods don’t have grocery stores, Carlos said.</p>
<p>“We are targeting areas that don’t have access to resources,” he said. “Many are giving out food, but is it sustainable and nutritious? We’re proving it can be done more efficiently and cheaper than buying a box of canned goods that aren’t good for you.</p>
<p>“When you talk about viruses and diseases going around, it’s primarily because of how we eat. We’ve been that voice for several neighborhoods at this point, so we just hope people are listening.”</p>
<p>Feed the Hood prepares free, hot meals that are balanced and nutritious in the kitchen of Third Presbyterian Church in Shadyside.&nbsp;Each plate contains a vegetable, starch and protein. Meals include Salisbury steak, mashed potatoes, carrots, chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, meatloaf, barbecue and salads. Carlos says he sometimes participates in events that also offer tips on nutrition. The organization previously worked with the “Community Delivery Hotline,” created by Hazelwood resident Shanon Williams, to have meals delivered to individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There needs to be food and education, not just either or ... .&nbsp;Food affects how we feel, even our mental state and overall well-being,” he said.</p>
<p>“Chef Los” notes that food donations are up across the country since COVID-19 struck. But he worries about the nutritious quality of the food that people receive.</p>
<p>“It's not so much that people aren’t passing out food and working hard to volunteer and give to those who need it,” he said. “But is the food going to sustain that family? Will they know what to do with it, or how to cook it?”</p>
<p>Feed the Hood has significantly increased its service since the pandemic began. The group was providing less than 50 meals a week in back in May. Now it serves hundreds each week.</p>
<p>About 100 meals a day are prepared for people living in Homewood, Oakland, Wilkinsburg, the Mon Valley, Hill District and South Side. Feed the Hood also has seen an increase in donations, having received around $12,000 in funds to date and more than 5,000 pounds in donated food weekly.</p>
<p>Its partners include Big Cartel, Circles Pittsburgh, The Rug Lab Carpet Cleaning, Farm to Table, Off Their Plate and Casa Brasil. To donate or volunteer, go to Feed the Hood’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/feedthehoodpittsburgh/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> or <a href="https://www.justsaychef.com/community?fbclid=IwAR2X85gkzuLwD64JhIxlc3VkdgZDrJQAMqQWmIdMFfPwUnFYEEmIbfw1FUI" target="_blank">www.justsaychef.com/community</a>.</p>
<p>When I asked Carlos why he does what he does, he offered a simple answer:&nbsp;“Why someone chooses to give back shouldn’t matter. It’s simple math ... . We just do the work.”</p>
<p><span>In a social media society that often selfishly glorifies good deeds, Carlos’ humility and his desire to simply&nbsp;“do the work” is necessary and refreshing.</span></p>
