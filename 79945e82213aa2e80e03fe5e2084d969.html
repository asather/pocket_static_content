<h1>Gerry Dulac: One word on the Steelers' minds in Round 2 — playmaker</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s hard enough for the Steelers to know which player they will select when they have a first-round selection, let alone having to wait till the halfway point of the second round.</p>
<p>But at least the process has come a little more into focus after what they saw in the first round of the NFL draft on Thursday night.</p>
<p>And while it is still difficult to pinpoint which player they will select with the 49th overall pick, it is a much safer prognosis to predict what type of player it will be.</p>
<p>And that is someone to help their offense.</p>
<p>Someone who can catch the ball and help them do something they struggled to do the final 10 games of the 2019 season — score points.</p>
<p>Or someone who has the speed to be a top-tier, No. 1 running back, not just another running back to pair with the three they already have.</p>
<p>A skill player.</p>
<p>A playmaker.</p>
<p>That’s what the Steelers need if they want to bring their offense up to speed with their suddenly improved defense. That’s what the Steelers want.</p>
<p>And wide receiver, the deepest crop in years, is the best opportunity. General manager Kevin Colbert <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/20/pittsburgh-steelers-nfl-draft-mike-tomlin-kevin-colbert-second-round/stories/202004200089" target="_blank">said the other day</a> the draft is rife with all kind of receivers — tall ones, slot guys, catch-and-run players. Six wide receivers — Henry Ruggs III, Jerry Jeudy, CeeDee Lamb, Jalen Reagor, Justin Jefferson and Brandon Aiyuk — were taken in the first round, the most since there were six in 2015. But the Steelers still should have enough options with the 17th pick in the second round to find a receiver who can help put the firepower back in the offense that disappeared when Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell did, too.</p>
<p>Those options include Baylor’s Denzel Mims, Clemson’s Tee Higgins, Colorado’s Laviska Shenault Jr., Notre Dame’s Chase Claypool, USC’s Michael Pittman and Penn State’s KJ Hamler.</p>
<p>So what will they do?</p>
<p>It would not be a surprise to see the Steelers select a running back, especially if a productive workhorse such as Wisconsin’s Jonathan Taylor — a Steelers back if ever there were one — was still available. Only one running back was selected in the first round, and that was LSU’s Clyde Edwards-Helaire with the 32nd pick to the Kansas City Chiefs. That has pushed a lot of quality running backs into the second round.</p>
<p>Finding a feature back, but only a feature back, makes plenty of sense. James Conner enters the final year of his rookie contract, and unless he returns to his 2018 form and convinces the Steelers he can stay healthy for a full season, there will be reluctance to give him a contract extension after the 2020 season.</p>
<p>Taylor had slightly more than 900 carries in three seasons with the Badgers, causing some NFL scouts to worry if his body has already absorbed too much punishment. But there is absolutely no indication of lingering injuries with Taylor. His medical tests at the NFL combine were cleaner than a doctor’s scalpel.</p>
<p>With players such as Taylor, D’Andre Swift of Georgia and J.K. Dobbins of Ohio State still available, there will likely be a run on running backs to start the second round. That could leave the Steelers thinking about Florida State’s Cam Akers, who could provide the one element they lack in the backfield — speed. Akers ran a 4.47 at the combine, making him one of the top backs in the draft to combine speed with size (5 feet 10 inches, 217 pounds) and production. He rushed for 1,144 yards and 14 touchdowns last season despite playing behind a poor offensive line.</p>
<p>If the Steelers don’t take a running back with their first pick, there is no need to take one at all. They are already loaded with running backs who were third-round picks or lower — Conner, Bennie Snell Jr. and Jaylen Samuels — and another would merely add to the type they already have.</p>
<p>Granted, it is possible they could take a running back in the second round with the idea they can still get a wide receiver on the third round. However, that possibility is unlikely. The Steelers would like to get an offensive lineman, preferably a guard/center, by the fourth round. But they also have a couple depth issues they would like to address on defense, including inside and outside linebacker and safety, and at least one of those, if not two, will likely come in the first four picks.</p>
<p>All of which leads back to their most pressing need in the draft — a playmaker. And the best place to find them is at wide receiver. And the Steelers history of finding them is unmatched in the league.</p>
<p>They have drafted seven receivers since 1998 who have had 1,000-yard seasons in the NFL — Hines Ward, Plaxico Burress, Santonio Holmes, Mike Wallace, Emmanuel Sanders, Antonio Brown and JuJu Smuith-Schuster. No other team in the league has had more in that time frame, according to Elias Sports Bureau.</p>
<p>But trying to project who will last to the 49th overall pick is not easy. No position had more first-round selections than wide receiver — offensive tackle and cornerback had as many — a big departure from the 2019 draft when only two wideouts were taken on the first round. Still, there are plenty from which to choose, including a number of tall receivers.</p>
<p>Four of the top remaining receivers — Mims, Higgins, Pittman and Claypool — are all 6-3 or taller. It’s not to suggest the Steelers won’t draft one of them. But they need a playmaker, a receiver who beats coverage at the line of scrimmage, gets in and out of breaks like a Maserati and stresses a defense after the catch. An Antonio Brown-type.</p>
<p>Of the remaining receivers, the players who best fit that mold are Shenault and Hamler.</p>
<p>The Steelers had a high grade on Aiyuk (6-0, 205), who had been climbing draft boards since the combine. But, when he went to the 49ers with the 25th selection, that narrowed their options a little more. That could leave Shenault (6-1, 217), who did everything including being a wildcat quarterback at Colorado. Like Aiyuk, Shenault had surgery on March 3 to repair a core muscle injury, but it is not considered a problem.</p>
<p>Shenault also had surgery to repair turf toe and shoulder injuries after his 2018 season at Colorado, but none of that is a deterrent for the Steelers. As one of the most diverse receivers in the draft, he’s the type of player the Steelers covet to make plays, whether catching the ball or running with it.</p>
<p>Remember this: From 1992 to 1995, the Steelers drafted five players in the first three rounds from Colorado, including Chad Brown and Kordell Stewart on the second round.</p>
<p>Shenault would add to the list.</p>
