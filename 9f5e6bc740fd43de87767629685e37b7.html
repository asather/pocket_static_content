<h1>During pandemic, Kiski Area High School finds ways to virtually mourn student who died in ATV crash</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kiski Area High School principal Chad Roland has unfortunately had to deal with deaths of students and staff several times over the past 11 years in his position.</p>
<p>Mr. Roland, however, has never had to assist his students with a grieving process during a pandemic that has kept the district at home. But when he heard the news that one of his students, whom he identified as senior Dominic&nbsp;“Nico” DeFalco, died in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/westmoreland/2020/04/06/One-killed-in-ATV-crash-in-Westmoreland-County/stories/202004060063" target="_blank">a tragic ATV accident</a> Sunday, Mr. Roland knew his response could not fall short, even in these restrictive circumstances.</p>
<p>“We just tried to look at it as if we had our kids right in front of us, what would we be doing,” Mr. Roland told the Post-Gazette on Tuesday. “What would be the things we’d be putting in place? And then we were trying to create a virtual equivalent.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Mr. Roland said he was shocked and devastated to learn that Nico, 17, died just a month before he was set to graduate from Kiski Area High School.&nbsp;The crash occurred around noon Sunday in the 200 block of McGeary Hollow Road in Allegheny Township in Westmoreland County, according to county emergency officials.</p>
<p>Further details surrounding the accident were not immediately released.</p>
<p>Allegheny Township police Chief Duane Fisher was not available for comment Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>In the case of a student death, Kiski Area school officials would usually tell students that there were counselors available for them to speak with in person about the loss of their classmate. The school would usually allow time for the students to meet up and mourn together, or have some sort of memorial service. During a time where neither of those things were possible due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Mr. Roland called a virtual staff meeting with his school counselors and faculty Monday morning to devise a plan on how to best support their kids as well as Nico’s family using online tools and resources.</p>
<p>“Our focus has been really on what can we do to put supports in place for our kids,” Mr. Roland said.&nbsp;“And that’s challenging because it’s such a personal, emotional, deep thing and you’re not with people. You’re not able to hug them. You’re not able to be there for them. It sometimes seems like you’re so distant and it’s very difficult.”</p>
<p>Because of the heavy nature of the situation, Mr. Roland said his staff wanted to make this process as personable as possible for their students. Instead of alerting families about Nico’s passing through email or an alert, Mr. Roland sent out a video message of himself explaining what happened, and letting families know where they could find resources during the students’ grieving process.</p>
<p>The school reached out to Westmoreland County officials to help provide such resources, Mr. Roland said. Staff members also set up opportunities for the students to get together virtually and talk about the situation, as well as have online sessions with school counselors.&nbsp;School officials then set up a link on the guidance counselor webpage asking students to share a message or memory of Nico online.</p>
<p>“In a lot of cases, what will happen is in the school, the locker will become a memorial and that’s not something that’s available to them now,” Mr. Roland said. “So we are trying to figure out ways that we can provide a little bit of what we know normally occurs. Kids get together, they want to memorialize. They want to remember their friend. They want to remember their classmate. So we are trying to create ways in a world that none of us truly understand right now to make that natural thing happen.”</p>
<p>Mr. Roland said the supportive response from the community has been helpful for students as well as for Nico’s family, who asked the principal to get as many prayers and positive thoughts directed toward them as possible. Nico&nbsp;was a part of the soccer and baseball team, and he played a little tennis, according to his principal.</p>

<p>“As a school, it’s a big community. And Kiski Area in general is a very close knit community and family across the whole area. In times like this, we just have to band together and make sure we’re providing the supports for people who need it.”</p>
<p>Kiski Area Superintendent Tim Scott praised Mr. Roland for the amount of thought he put into his plan of action in such a short amount of time. “He knew the young man and has just done a wonderful job in trying to provide a personal response to this tragedy in this new online environment,” Mr. Scott said. “I just give him so much credit in his thoughtfulness in being able to try to navigate this.”</p>
<p>Mr. Roland said the school will continue to provide resources for students as long as they are needed as he realizes that the&nbsp;“sting” of this tragedy won’t go away anytime soon.</p>
<p>“We just have to try to get back to the root of everything and that’s human relations and human interactions, and that’s what we’re trying to get back to,” he said. “Even if that doesn’t look the way it normally would look. We just want to get back to that philosophy of getting together and making sure we are there for one another.”</p>
