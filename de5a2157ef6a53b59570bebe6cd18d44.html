<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: Are any Pirates untouchable as trade deadline nears?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Zach:</strong>&nbsp;Is there anyone on the current Pirates roster who you would list “untouchable” as trade bait?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Let me think about it for a minute ... no. Now the caveat there is some guys have value and therefore shouldn’t just be given away. It would have to be the right deal for some of the players, obviously, but none should be considered untouchable. And that includes a player like Ke’Bryan Hayes, whose value might actually be more as a trade piece.</p>
<p><strong>Trags:</strong> Do you think the Yankees, who could use bullpen help, would be willing to give up a decent return for Keone Kela?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Kela has talent. He has shown at times he can be a good pitcher. He is also unreliable and is also hurt. I can’t imagine the Yankees or any team bending over backward to try and acquire him. I think if he got healthy in the next week someone might be willing to take him, but the return will be minimal.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:&nbsp;</strong>Is Pirates OF Bryan Reynolds a one-year wonder, or do you think he’ll eventually turn it around?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I don’t think that’s fair. He is a good baseball player, but he hasn’t played well this year. I think he is better than he has played. I don’t know if he’s quite as good as he was last year, but I expect him to he a reliable starting outfielder for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> What is realistic to think the Penguins can get for Kris Letang or Evgeni Malkin? It seems like their age and contracts make them tough to move for value.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> There is a good chance you can’t move either for the kind of value you are looking for. Malkin is still a superstar, though, and his contract isn’t bad relative to what stars make. I think there would be a lot of interest in him, and interest creates a market and drives the price up. Letang would be tougher to move because of his injury history and he isn’t a great fit in every team’s system.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> The feelings around the NHL is that Toronto got the much better end of the real with the Penguins. Jim Rutherford has done a great job overall, but has he lost his ability to make good deals? He has missed on the last few trades he has made.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:&nbsp;</strong>I don’t think that’s how it works. He didn’t forget how to make deals. I think what happens is when a guy has so much success making trades and adding the right pieces that you start to believe your own headlines. It seems like he believes he can fix the Penguins because that’s what he has always done. The thing is the more deals you make, the more likely you are to make mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Christopher:</strong> Why do you try and compare protesting to attending sporting events? One is a right, the other is a privilege. Do you understand the difference?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Actually the First Amendment guarantees freedom of expression. And you don’t get to decide what is and isn’t a noble expression. Further I wasn’t comparing the two activities; I was comparing the crowd sizes. As I repeatedly say, either large gatherings are bad or they aren’t.</p>
<p><strong>Chad:&nbsp;</strong>What sports phrase are you beyond tired of hearing? For example, I’m over the “he stood on his head” as a means to say a goalie in ice hockey played great.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Any version of&nbsp;‘“the new normal’ is awful and needs to go.</p>
