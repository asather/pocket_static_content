<h1>Pet Tales: Guardian Angels train and meet up with partners, finally</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Isn’t Foxy beautiful?” said Craig Hodgkins of Scott as he stroked the thick, glossy fur of the black German shepherd he acquired five days earlier.&nbsp;“I’ve smiled more in the last five days than I have in the last five years.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hodgkins, who served 21 years in the Marines, including deployments in Iraq and Kuwait, wasn’t the only person smiling on Thursday.&nbsp; So were three other military veterans and a retired police officer. All were at Grove City Memorial Park with dogs they were teamed with last Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They traveled to Mercer County to learn how to work with dogs that were custom-trained&nbsp;by Guardian Angels Medical Service Dogs (<a href="http://www.MedicalServiceDogs.org" target="_blank">www.MedicalServiceDogs.org</a>) to help each of them deal&nbsp;with a wide array of health issues, from mobility to traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>Whaler, 6, never took his eyes off Jay Cox, who served in U.S. Foreign Service followed by 21 years as an officer in multiple police departments in Maryland. He retired in 2009 and has traumatic brain injury incurred during a SWAT gunfight.</p>
<p>“We have bonded in ways that I did not expect,” said the man from Charlotte, N.C. “He watches me and protects me. I think he loves me.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The five teams&nbsp;“are all doing phenomenally,” said Paige Neilsen, a trainer at the Guardian Angels breeding and training facility in Williston, Fla.</p>
<p>People usually travel to the north Florida town for 10 days of training with their dogs. But these five dogs and 15 others were stranded there when the new coronavirus closed the Florida border to travel.&nbsp;It takes 18-24 months and $25,000 in donations to train the dogs; the recipients pay nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carol Borden, founder and CEO of Guardian Angels, planned the trip as soon as the dogs were allowed to travel. She flew trainer Joanne Werner of New Eagle down to Florida so she could help Ms. Neilsen drive 17 hours in a rented 15-foot cargo van to Mercer County. In the van were service dogs Foxy, Whaler, Jud, Doc, Rik and Rooney, whom Ms. Werner will deliver to a foster home in Murrysville.</p>
<p>Trainers, dogs and their new partners all stayed at the Hampton Inn in Grove City, where staff and management&nbsp;“were very accommodating,” Ms. Neilsen said.&nbsp;The dogs and the veterans had a final get-together in the park on Thursday before heading home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foxy jumped up on the bed to wake Mr. Hodgkins twice this week when he was having what he calls&nbsp;“night terrors.” Foxy, who is trained to soothe him, was sponsored by the Colcom Foundation, which also sponsored Foxy, Doc and two other dogs.</p>
<p>Doc has already proved her worth to Alexis Taggart,&nbsp;who served in the Army from 2011 to 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I had a panic attack during a training session” this week, she said. “I ran out, crying, and Doc followed me and calmed me.”</p>
<p>The dog will join her at college while she earns a master’s degree in psychology. She also plans to get a PhD in psychology.</p>
<p>Rik will be going to prison with Ryan Yoder of Harrisburg. A Marine whose service includes the Gulf War and Somalia, Mr. Yoder is the statewide veterans coordinator for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. He travels to 25 state prisons and works with 3,000 incarcerated veterans.&nbsp;Rik was sponsored by the Yellow Ribbon Fund, which has sponsored 20 dogs.</p>
<p>Vietnam veteran Jim Grossman, a retired Marine who lives in Hermitage, said that he and Jud “have only been together for five days but it seems like he has been with me forever.&nbsp;Armstrong cable sponsored Jud and 12 other dogs.</p>
<p>PNC sponsored 37 dogs, including Whaler, Mr. Cox’s partner.</p>
<p>Life Changing Service Dogs for Veterans, a Bethel Park organization run by Vietnam veterans Tony Accamando and John Piazza, has raised money to sponsor more than 75 dogs. Twenty-nine dogs have been trained and placed with Pennsylvania veterans.</p>
<p>In 10 years, Guardian Angels has trained and placed more than 340 dogs, but the&nbsp;waiting list for dogs is long. Guardian Angels has purchased 102 acres in Robinson, Washington County, to build a training facility to shorten the wait.&nbsp;Vietnam veteran Jack Wagner, former state auditor general, is regional development director of fundraising. A ground-breaking date has not been set yet, he said on Thursday, when he visited the five new Guardian Angels teams.</p>
<p>Helping with training and orientation this week were two veterans with their dogs. Dustin Schneider of Mount Washington has been with Spangle since December 2018. Ben Keen of McCandless has had Bolt since Sept. 21.</p>
