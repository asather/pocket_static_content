<h1>Their campuses now largely emtpy, three Pittsburgh universities offer aid in pandemic fight</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three Pittsburgh universities are preparing for the possibility that rooms in one or more of their dorms may be needed to house patients or medical professionals battling the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Officials with the University of Pittsburgh and both Duquesne and Carnegie Mellon universities confirmed they have been in contact with health and hospital officials. The schools did not identify which buildings, the number of rooms or how specifically they might be used.</p>
<p>Campuses across Pennsylvania and in other states are seen as having the potential to provide overflow accommodations and various support should the pandemic produce a surge of patients that stretches thin regional health care staff and hospital capacity.</p>

<p>The U.S. tops all countries in the number of cases of the new coronavirus. As of Friday, nearly a quarter million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed nationally, and deaths were approaching 6,100, according to an interactive tracker from Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Cases in Pennsylvania have topped 8,000&nbsp;with 102 deaths, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/04/03/COVID-19-cases-Allegheny-County-pittsburgh-pennsylvania/stories/202004030129" target="_blank">according to the latest state data</a>.</p>
<p>At Pitt, a statement from spokesman Kevin Zwick said the university wants to act swiftly if needed. One dorm, Lothrop Hall, already is in use to offer housing for healthcare professionals from nearby UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, connected to the dorm by an adjacent skywalk.</p>
<p>“Pitt is committed to helping the Pittsburgh region through this unprecedented situation,” the statement read. “In addition to offering Lothrop Hall, which is currently being used as a respite site for UPMC clinical staff, we have cleaned and sanitized several residence halls to have ready on short notice, if needed, for use by the local medical community.”</p>

<p>Duquesne President Ken Gormley described a similar effort. noting his school's century-long relationship with UPMC Mercy Hospital, located just off campus.</p>
<p>"We reached out directly to UPMC Mercy – because they’re our neighbor – and offered to make available dorm space if that is helpful during this healthcare emergency," he said. "We’ve been working cooperatively with the UPMC Mercy team on a plan for them to use both dorm space and parking if that is needed."</p>
<p>Mr. Gormley added, "They have not yet determined if and when that will be necessary, but they’ve been extremely appreciative of our willingness to assist."</p>
<p>At Carnegie Mellon, spokeswoman Julianne Mattera said: "President Farnam Jahanian has asked our housing services and operations leadership to determine how CMU can make space available to aid in the effort."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency is assessing a number of sites across the state that could be used as housing or medical facilities.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, said PEMA spokeswoman Ruth Miller, they could include shuttered hospitals, warehouse sites, academic facilities such as state-owned universities or other colleges and universities.</p>
<p>"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has extensive experience in conducting site assessments and retrofitting facilities for a new purpose,'" she explained.</p>

Lawrence Convention Center in Downtown Pittsburgh was eyed as a care site if a surge in local infections occurs.</p>
