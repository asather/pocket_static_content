<p>Pennsylvanians studying for the bar exam will have at least two extra months to cram.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Board of Law Examiners has rescheduled the July 2020 exam for September 9 and 10 because of safety and health considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The organization warned that even the September timetable is dependent on how the crisis progresses and “depends on factors that cannot now fully be assessed.”</p>
<p>The move was approved by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which also sanctioned a limited license that would let qualifying applicants practice if they are supervised by experienced lawyers.</p>
<p>“The Board believes this order represents an appropriate balance between the need to ensure that the public is represented competently, the particular need for additional lawyers to assist the public in matters related to or arising from the pandemic, and the need for graduating law students to start the careers for which they have worked and invested so much,” board Chairman David Fine said in a statement.</p>
