<p>When Pat Gallagher and Alexander Valentine were looking to downsize several years ago, there was only one place he wanted to go: home.</p>
<p>“My husband was from Pittsburgh. He went to Carnegie Mellon,” his wife noted.</p>
<p>Mr. Valentine, who <a href="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/postgazette/obituary.aspx?n=alexander-laurie-valentine&amp;pid=195019306&amp;fhid=9799" target="_blank">died in January</a>, was an engineer and cartographer who worked in Houston for NASA on many Apollo missions, including Apollo 11.</p>
<p>“He was part of the original team that worked on the moon landing,” she said.</p>
<p>The couple had raised two children in Brookline, Mass., and after they moved here, had two addresses three blocks away from each other. Their favorite was Unit 707 at the <strong>University Square Apartments</strong>, 4625 Fifth Ave., Oakland.</p>
<p>“I liked the way the building looked,” Ms. Gallagher said. “It was warmer and cheerier.”</p>
<p>The two-bedroom, one-bathroom co-op unit is on the market for $125,000 (MLS No. 1441006) with Jill Portland and Devin Canofari of RE/MAX Realty Brokers (<a href="https://www.pittsburgh-homes.com/search/internal/area_Oakland-200002/sortby_priceDesc/page_1/details_1441006" target="_blank">pittsburgh-homes.com</a> or 412-521-1000). It is open by appointment in accordance with COVID-19 guidelines.</p>
<p>The unit is a cooperative, which means the residents own their units and pay a single co-op fee that includes all maintenance, utilities and property taxes. The building has 24-hour security and a concierge desk for packages.&nbsp;There is an underground parking garage and reserved spaces are available for an additional fee.</p>
<p>“The building has the greatest management and they take care of everything,” Ms. Gallagher said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Being an older couple, you don’t have a house to contend with. I wanted to party!”</p>
<p>Built in 1956, the highrise is blocks away from the Carnegie Museum of Art, Phipps Conservatory and Schenley Park. It is also within walking distance of Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC hospitals.</p>
<p>Ms. Gallagher, who is moving to live with her son, said she and her husband made many upgrades on the apartment.</p>
<p>“We replaced a couple of heating systems, the bathroom and the kitchen. It was a lot of fun.”</p>
<p>The unit is painted a bright white and has room for lots of artwork on the walls. The 28- by- 12-foot living room offers plenty of space for furniture and entertaining.&nbsp;At the far end is the dining area. The windows over views of Oakland and beyond.</p>
<p>The recently renovated kitchen measures 12 by 6 feet and has granite counter tops, stainless-steel sinks, white appliances and Shaker-style cabinets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The master bedroom measures 16 by 12 feet and has a large window. The second bedroom measures 14 by 9 feet and was used as an office.&nbsp;The bathroom has original, 4-by-4-inch green tile and a white vanity.</p>
<p>The couple enjoyed volunteering for and attending events at the nearby museums and attractions. Mr. Valentine’s work for NASA sometimes brought him speaking engagements, Ms. Gallagher said.</p>
<p>“He was part of the Museum of Natural History and worked at the Arnold Palmer Foundation as well as the Carnegie Science Center.”</p>
<p>She has fond memories of their time in Oakland.</p>
<p>“It is a wonderful building. It is such a unique concept. I just loved living there.”</p>
