<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Eric Wright Crosby has been appointed the Henry J. Heinz II Director of Carnegie Museum of Art in Oakland.</p>
<p>Since January 2018, Mr. Crosby, 40, of Oakland, has been the art museum’s acting director. In 2016, he was named the Richard Armstrong Curator of Contemporary and Modern Art.</p>
<p>“Eric has a deep commitment to the mission of Carnegie Museums and a clear understanding of what it will take to build on the distinctive strengths of Carnegie Museum of Art,” said Steven Knapp, president and chief executive officer of Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Mr. Crosby organized an exhibition titled “20/20: The Studio Museum in Harlem and Carnegie Museum of Art.” He also managed the museum’s Forum series, which presents the work of emerging and established artists, most recently Ruth Root, Ian Cheng, Michael Williams, and Alison Knowles.</p>
<p>He oversaw&nbsp; a complete transformation of the museum’s postwar and contemporary galleries. A current exhibition he curated, “Crossroads: 1945 to Now”&nbsp; reveals the critical role of the artist in everyday life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am deeply honored to take on the permanent role of director at Carnegie Museum of Art,” Mr. Crosby said in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>“I will continue to champion curatorial projects and educational initiatives that provoke critical conversations about our world and respond to the key social issues of our time,” Mr. Crosby added.</p>
<p>Before joining Carnegie Museum of Art in 2015, Mr. Crosby&nbsp; was associate curator of visual arts at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minn. He received his bachelor’s degree from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn. and a master’s degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.</p>
