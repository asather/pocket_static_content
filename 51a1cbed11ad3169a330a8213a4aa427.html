<h1>Philips halts production of ventilators amid government review of contract</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A contract for Murrysville-based Philips Respironics to make hospital ventilators has been cut short amid a government probe.</p>
<p>Philips said Monday that the company had been directed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to stop making ventilators for the Strategic National Stockpile, which it had been contracted to do in April. The company had delivered just 12,300 of the 43,000 ventilators that it was to produce by December for the nation’s emergency medical supply warehouse.</p>
<p>A Health and Human Services spokeswoman said the contract had been suspended because it was “subject to an internal HHS investigation and legal review.” She declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Philips was among the companies contracted by the government to make more than 187,000 ventilators by the end of the year. Philips, better known locally for its line of sleep-medicine products, began ramping up production when the COVID-19 outbreak emerged in China in January.</p>
<p>Royal Philips has 8,000 employees in China.</p>
<p>Philips had planned to crank up production by 4,000 ventilators per week by the end of the third quarter to meet rising demand, a company spokesman said in March. Philips Sleep and Respiratory Care, which includes the ventilator assembly and testing operation, has nearly 2,000 employees in five Western Pennsylvania locations that include manufacturing, distribution and service centers.</p>
<p>A company spokeswoman did not say whether the contract end would affect employment locally. The final assembly and testing of the ventilators was done in Murrysville and at a second facility in Carlsbad, Calif.</p>
<p>But in a statement, CEO Frans van Houten said he was proud of the way the company met COVID-19’s challenges.</p>
<p>“I am proud that with great urgency and under intense pressure we achieved a fourfold ventilator production expansion with substantial investments: We hired hundreds of new colleagues for our factories in the U.S. and called upon our supply chain partners to massively step up, all in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. “To date, we have delivered on our commitments to HHS.”</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. van Houten said the company was “committed to work with the government and several of its agencies to support health care providers with the diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and management of COVID-19 patients as well as the provision of regular health care.”</p>
<p>Doctors use mechanical ventilators for people who are severely ill and have trouble breathing because of COVID-19, which attacks the lungs.</p>
<p>As of Monday, the highly contagious virus had claimed the lives of 183,400 people in the U.S.&nbsp;The average daily number of COVID-19 patients on a ventilator in Pennsylvania was 79.1, the state Department of Health reported Monday, a decline from a daily average of 92.1 patients on a ventilator a week ago.</p>
