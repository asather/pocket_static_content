<h1>Crooked Creek Distillery opens a second location -- in Irwin </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Crooked Creek Distillery, which opened in August 2018 in the trail town of West Newton, has opened its second Westmoreland County location — in Irwin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its bottle shop there — at 415 Main. St., Irwin, Pa., 15642&nbsp;—&nbsp;is open from noon to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday while the main West Newton one is open 4 to 8 p.m. Wednesday to Friday and noon to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The business reminds customers to wear masks when coming to either buy bottles to go of products including Spring House Vodka, Newton’s Cove Rum and Crescent Moon Whiskey, plus the moonshines with which it started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The distillery just released a “small batch” of Rye Whiskey made with locally grown grain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crooked Creek’s West Newton location — just across the Youghiogheny River from the Great Allegheny Passage biking and hiking trail —&nbsp;is one of the drinks destinations on the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2019/09/19/Beer-Laurel-Highlands-Visitors-Bureau-Pour-Tour-trail-wine-cider-mead-passport/stories/201908200128" target="_blank">Laurel Highlands Pour Tou</a>r, a self-directed tour of the tourist destination east of Pittsburgh. Another Irwin stop on that list is New Crescent Brewing Co., <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2019/09/19/Beer-Laurel-Highlands-Visitors-Bureau-Pour-Tour-trail-wine-cider-mead-passport/stories/201908200128" target="_blank">which opened in early 2019</a>. And Laurel Highlands Meadery has an outlet in town, too. They’re all within easy walking distance.</p>
<p>In other West Newton drinks news, Bloom Brew, a brewery in the fire station right on the Yough&nbsp;— has started, like other breweries, to can some beers to sell to go. Jeff Bloom launched with four-packs of four varieties last week.</p>
<p>“It was just a timely evolution that just happened to coincide with COVID-19,” he says.&nbsp;“We're going to try canning four to five different beers every week and keep our flagship stuff in the mix.”</p>

<p>New Crescent Brewing also has announced that it plans to offer cans soon, which are selling well at Four Seasons Brewing in Latrobe. &nbsp;</p>
