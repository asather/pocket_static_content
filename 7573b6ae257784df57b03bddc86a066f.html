<h1>Local Scene: Dinosoul addresses 'the social dilemma' (indirectly) with new single</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Donny Donovan and Carolyn Hilliard raise their heavenly voices on “How to Survive,” a new single from Dinosoul that hovers over a heady issue.</p>
<p>“How to Survive” is a synthpop track from the Pittsburgh duo/couple that’s bubbling, ethereal quality is undercut by a subtle message relating to the stresses of social media.</p>
<p>The song, clocking in at 3:33, is presented in three phases, with a pastoral, meditative intro that is interrupted by what sounds like a creaking door leads into an airy click track, Donovan tentatively singing, “How do I go on without you all?”</p>
<p>As the tempo picks up, so does her determination, to where she’s repeating, “Do what you want in your circle/do what you want in your life.”</p>

<p>“This song is really about letting go of toxic energy,” says Donovan, a veteran of the indie/punk scene in such bands as Roulette Waves, Dream Phone and Hearken. “Wanting so badly to ‘fit in’ to a circle but realizing you’re part of many.</p>
<p>“My natural curiosity and striving for the truth,” she continues, “doesn’t obey the laws of these circles and that’s when I recognize my mind is more important. We are all manipulated and social media has made things worse.</p>
<p>The song hits streaming services just as people are watching “The Social Dilemma,” a Netflix documentary that details how in fact we are manipulated, triggered and divided by what we see in our social media feeds.</p>
<p>“There’s a little bit of truth in almost everything but we keep separating ourselves from the whole,” Donovan says. “Good intentions are quickly pressured to stay in line with the mind of the powerful influencers. The song is about letting go and moving on from agendas and vibrations that aren’t aligning with your truth.”</p>
<p><strong>PHAT R.E.M.</strong></p>
<p>Pittsburgh jazz cabaret singer Phat Man Dee has recorded a cover of the classic R.E.M. ballad “Everybody Hurts,” which she will release on streaming platforms on Sept. 25.</p>
<p>It was recorded with pianist/engineer Corey Fisher, whom she met through Creative Life Support’s We Rock Workshop, in their separate home studios.</p>
<p>“I have seen so many friends, and people in general, all over the world in so much real pain, hurt, and confusion. I think this particular song is important at this time because it speaks to the need of us as people to reach out to our friends now more than ever,” Phat Man Dee said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>MIXUS TAPES</strong></p>
<p>Some comforting music comes our way from The Mixus Brothers, the fictional duo of Jebbh &amp; Red Mixus, as played by drummer Johnny Willett and banjoist/guitarist Jacob Stempky.</p>
<p>The duo just issued “The Lonesome Gods — Chapter Two,” a five-song EP of hushed Americana in the rustic vein of Iron &amp; Wine or Bonnie “Prince” Billy.</p>

<p>Willett and Stempky met in Frick Park in 2011 while taking their daughters there to play and released their debut album, “Westward The Tide,” a year later, taking the name from the characters in a novel by western writer Louis L’Amour.</p>
<p>They once told WYEP that their influences range from the “Osborne Brothers to Ween to Pink Floyd to Public Enemy and punk bands we liked in high school,” but the sound is pretty consistently in the realm of folk, alt-country, at times almost sounding like a mellower A.T.S.</p>
<p>The EP can be found on Reverbnation.</p>
