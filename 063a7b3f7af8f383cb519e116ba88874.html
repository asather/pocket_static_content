<h1>19 Neighbors: Community garden is an urban oasis in South Side Slopes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>19 Neighbors is a series of 19 stories about Western Pennsylvanians and how they are helping, hoping and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic.</em></p>
<p>Around 7 p.m. on Saturday, the sun starts to hang a little lower over the Bandi Schaum Community Garden in the South Side Slopes after a scorching afternoon. But the old ball field is alive with activity.</p>
<p>A young couple spreads a blanket out for a picnic dinner and their 4-year-old daughter traipses through the grass, while a group of gregarious graybeards hold court in lawn chairs under a makeshift pergola fashioned from old bamboo and a massive tree limb.</p>
<p>A Romanian gent plays fetch with his dog and fires up the charcoal on an old grill; and, near the entrance, 63-year old Diane Kline is proudly showing off her 10- by- 20-foot garden plot in a delightfully thick Pittsburgh accent.</p>
<p>“Look, I got melons growing! I have 20 tomato plants! This is something new I’m trying,” she said, pointing to a little bush. “This is called ground cherries. This is pumpkin —&nbsp;see it? That’s a pumpkin, that green thing growing. I have okra growing. Peas. I already picked zucchinis.</p>
<p>“I never had it like this. I’m up here every day just pulling weeds and moving this and changing this. It’s a good outlet. It makes me so happy to see things grow. That makes me feel so good!”</p>
<p>This little oasis has been a source of release during this pandemic summer for the roughly 100 people who maintain 80 garden plots here: an outdoor escape for city slickers with small courtyards or no yard at all to sweat and get their hands dirty and have an opportunity to safely socialize in sunshine and fresh air.</p>
<p>There is negligible risk of the transmission of the coronavirus that triggers the COVID-19 illness in large outdoor spaces where social distancing is practiced.</p>
<p>A South Side resident and secretary at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, Ms. Kline said, “I’m working at home on the computer and you don’t know how bonkers that’ll make you ‘cause you’re on that computer from 8 until 5. After 5 o’clock every day, I come here.”</p>
<p>She lost her two side gigs as a banquet waitress and a bartender and had a major invasive surgery earlier this summer, but this garden has kept her going.&nbsp;She went to see her doctor a few days ago, and he told her she was well ahead of schedule in her recovery.</p>
<p>“He said, I don’t know how you did it. Well, this [garden] is how I did it,” Ms. Kline said.</p>
<p>The garden falls under the purview of the city of Pittsburgh’s Department of Public Works, but Donna Tarkett has been the volunteer manager of it for the past seven years.</p>
<p>She works with foster children and families through the Children’s Institute of Pittsburgh, and during the pandemic she said her job has “been a real challenge.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been busier the past five months than ever before,” Ms. Tarkett said. “It’s been difficult. The garden has always been that to me, but over the past five months it’s been absolutely crucial for my mental health. I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have the garden to go to.”</p>
<p>When COVID-19 first hit Pittsburgh, the garden, like many public spaces, was closed down. Ms. Tarkett, a South Side Slopes resident, reached out to the city and contacted council President Bruce Kraus to lobby for it to reopen.</p>
<p>“I was just like, ‘You can’t do that. This is going to be so important for people,’ ” she said. “I reached out to whoever I could think of telling them why this needs to be open and that we’ll maintain the safety and social distance.”</p>
<p>The garden was open again by May, and since then the garden’s 80 plots have flourished, many overflowing with bounties of fruits, vegetables and flowers. Gardeners are making it a place just to hang out for hours on end nearly every evening and all day long on the weekends.</p>
<p>“You can tell just by looking at the garden this year how important it’s become, the way people are taking care of their plots,” Ms. Tarkett said. “There are more people there this year. It looks beautiful.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen it look so robust and well maintained. We’re seeing more people, more regularly. You feel safe, it’s outside and you can get some social interaction in a safe way.”</p>
<p>“Gardening has always been my therapy and I love the community aspect of it,” she continued. “I love that people are coming together and growing food and sharing it and making friends in this little piece of quiet and country right in the middle of the city.”</p>
<p>“It feels like you’re away from everything even though you’re right in the middle of South Side. It’s really a special place.”</p>
<p>Brian Oswald agrees. The South Side Slopes resident has maintained a plot at Bandi Schaum since it opened in 2012.</p>
<p>“I need to be outside,” he said. “I hate watching TV. This is the time of year when you have all the daylight. You get away from your house. You can’t go out to the bars and socialize where you normally would, and so this helps especially this year.”</p>
<p>Mr. Oswald’s fiance, Alena Dvoryanchikova, is a nurse in the cardiac intensive care unit at UPMC-Presbyterian and the past few months have been “really rough,” she said, but the time the couple spend in the garden has been an emotional salve.</p>
<p>“That’s my little haven right now,” Ms. Dvoryanchikova, a&nbsp;native of Kazakhstan, said. “I’ve been having a really hard time mentally with this, with working with COVID patients, and the social distance has been really rough, too.”</p>
<p>“Working in a hospital, I am a risk to the community. I would go into this dark place and Brian would drag me out —&nbsp;every day he would ask me, ‘Do you want to go to the garden? Do you want to go to the garden.’ And I’d be like, yeah, I guess, but once I was there,” she said, her mood would immediately brighten.</p>
<p>“It’s always a good move to go there to take care of our plot, or to plant, or to have a distanced conversation with others. It’s definitely been a really therapeutic thing for me, and for Brian’s sanity,” she laughed,&nbsp;“and to connect with our community.”</p>
<p>“Brian laughs at me because I give pep talks to all my vegetables, so when they grow, they make me very happy,” she laughed. “They are my babies that are growing.”</p>
<p>Roland Rezda lives on the South Side but grew up working in gardens in his hometown of Timisoara, a Romanian city almost exactly the same size as Pittsburgh. He immigrated to the United States 20 years ago and had long given up gardening until five years ago when he got a Bandi Schaum plot.</p>
<p>This summer, he says he spends about six days a week at the garden, for anywhere from three to eight hours a day, tending to 35 tomato plants and 16 varieties of fruits and vegetables and often grilling what he grows there.</p>
<p>“There’s not a lot of places where you can safely socialize,” he said. “My wife goes walking. This is my walking, my running, my activities.”</p>
<p>Adam and Cara Jette, of Allentown, spend time here nearly daily, and the garden has become their young daughter Alice’s favorite destination.</p>
<p>“We live in the city and don’t really have a backyard. So this is her backyard. We come here almost every night and she runs around,” Adam Jette said, “What else are you gonna do with a 4-year-old in quarantine for six straight months? We give her choices of what to do, and she almost always picks the garden. It’s her favorite thing.”</p>
<p>Of the many things Peggy Sullivan of the South Side Slopes has missed during the pandemic, live music has been at the top of the list, and on numerous occasions gardeners have brought guitars, fiddles and banjos to play and sing.</p>
<p>“When I’m walking up the path and I hear music before I arrive, it just fills my soul with joy, it elevates the garden those nights to another level,” she said, adding that just working in the garden has been an affirmation.</p>
<p>“During these times of COVID, planting a seed or seedling and watching it grow, watching life, it just instills hope.”</p>
