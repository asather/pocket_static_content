<h1>Congregations, other faith groups receive millions in federal aid</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Southwestern Pennsylvania churches, synagogues, religious schools and certain other faith-based employers received between $44 million and $109 million in payroll funding from a federal aid program designed to ease the pandemic-induced economic crash.</p>
<p>And that range nearly doubles to between $80 million and $194 million if one adds the region’s various faith-based social-service providers.</p>
<p>That’s according to a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette analysis of U.S. Small Business Administration data on the Payroll Protection Program, through which Congress authorized $660 billion nationwide in loans to employers of all types. Those loans can be forgiven if used to maintain employees for at least the short duration of the program, meaning that many of the loans will ultimately become grants.</p>
<p>Some 175 faith-based employers reported that they retained between 7,453 and 12,766 jobs through the duration of the program in 10 southwestern Pennsylvania counties&nbsp;—&nbsp;Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, Washington and Westmoreland.</p>
<p>Those figures include part-time and full-time workers, and they are surely an undercount, because SBA data lacked job totals for many employers. The higher end of that range includes institutions like nursing homes that have some faith-based element in mission or tradition, but whose primary work is meeting physical or social needs rather than spiritual ones.</p>
<p>Leaders of faith-based employers say the funds were crucial to their being able to keep employees paid and, in many cases, to provide social services to the wider public during the pandemic and recession.</p>
<p>But advocates for strict separation of church and state said no crisis justifies government funds going to salaries of clergy and other religious workers.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Religious leaders defend their participation in the program, noting that the ultimate destination for the funds was to their employees. The pandemic, shutdowns and recession, they said, dealt staggering blows to religious and secular employers alike.</p>
<p>“I feel grateful this program recognized that churches are important employers,” said the Rev. Liddy Barlow, executive minister of Christian Associates of Southwest Pennsylvania, an umbrella group of various Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant churches. “The funds go almost entirely into the pockets of the thousands of people in our region that are employed by churches and faith-based organizations.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Roman Catholic Bishop David Zubik said the program was looking at institutions “as employers,” regardless of affiliation. “The point was that people would not lose their jobs during an exceptional time.”</p>
<p>Opponents of such funding see a clear violation of the First Amendment’s clause prohibiting government-sponsored religion.</p>
<p>“We understand that we’re facing an unprecedented and difficult time,” said Maggie Garrett, vice president for public policy at Americans United for Separation of Church and State. But “the difficulty doesn’t mean we can ignore the Constitution.” While some faith-based social services have in the past received aid, “paying for clergy salaries is really breaking from tradition.”</p>
<p>Added Marie Schaub, secretary for the Pittsburgh Freethought Community: “We firmly believe that taxpayers should not be forced to finance religious institutions in any way.&nbsp;Religious organizations are not subjected to the same rigorous financial reporting that other nonprofits are. Even if the funds were to be used for a secular purpose, there is little oversight” into how they’re spent.</p>
<p>The SBA said on its website, however, that any faith-based recipient&nbsp;“will retain its independence, autonomy, right of expression, religious character, and authority over its governance, and no faith-based organization will be excluded from receiving funding because leadership with, membership in, or employment by that organization is limited to persons who share its religious faith and practice.”</p>
<p>But Ram Cnaan, director of the Program for Religion and Social Policy Research, said via email that the program “opens a new front in the church-state relationships.”</p>
<p>“On the one hand, [some] congregations are employers with large number of employees and like other employers they find it difficult to keep paying salaries,” said Mr. Cnaan, who has been studying faith-based social services for more than two decades. “So, lifting all boats to allow most people not to be laid off should include places of worship.”</p>
<p>But he said that in the past, government limited aid to faith-based services, such as a church-run day-care center, not the congregation itself.&nbsp;“Now the Payroll Protection Program funding to faith-based organizations may not be distinguishing about who it supports [from clergy to the church nurse] which will further blur the line between church and state. I am sure that many lawyers are eyeing it and when the COVID-19 storm will pass, we will find out that many violations took place.”</p>
<p>He said it “shows that when we are in a crisis mode, many of our principles are ignored.”</p>
<p>In southwestern Pennsylvania, all of the religious recipients identified by name in the SBA database are from a wide gamut of Christian and Jewish denominational and non-denominational groups.</p>
<p>The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh reported receiving $2.5 million in payroll aid, while 110 parishes and schools with the diocese received between $13 million and $14 million, the diocese reported. In all, Catholic organizations in southwestern Pennsylvania — including those affiliated with the Diocese of Greensburg, religious orders or independent institutions — received between $32 million and $77 million and retained at least 4,647 jobs, according to a Post-Gazette analysis.</p>
<p>SBA data show 100 Protestant and Orthodox employers of multiple denominations receiving between $40 million and $98 million and retained at least 6,516 jobs, according to the SBA report. Many of them are independent of any denominational affiliation; the largest denominational category was Presbyterian, with 19 institutions receiving between $12 and $30 million and retaining 2,190 jobs, many in senior communities and higher education.</p>
<p>Twelve Jewish community organizations, synagogues and schools received a total of between $7 million and $19 million and retained 1,603 jobs.</p>
<p>Among southwestern Pennsylvania’s religious congregations, the biggest recipient was North Way Christian Community, which received between $1 million and $2 million and retained 97 jobs, according to SBA data. Officials with the Pine-based independent church, which has campuses in multiple locations across the region, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Another 18 congregations received at least $350,000 in payroll aid. They include several large Protestant congregations with multiple sites across the region. They also include several Catholic parishes with schools.</p>
<p>Pastor Jeff Leake of Allison Park Church, a Hampton-based congregation with multiple campuses across the region and which retained 101 jobs, said the program “enabled us to keep everybody employed,” from custodians to worship leaders. When in-person worship was canceled, “we were able to deploy a lot of our staff to do social services. We went from one to six food distribution centers.”</p>
<p>Allegheny Center Alliance Church, a North Side-based congregation that retained 110 jobs through the program, also ramped up its social service efforts, such as distributing thousands of meals weekly to public-school students.</p>
<p>“When the pandemic began, it was really just a matter of complete uncertainty,” church treasurer Enzo Santilli added. “We looked at it and said maybe this is a tangible way to keep as many employees as possible. We could keep them employed rather than mass layoff, which then creates a burden of people having to go on unemployment.”</p>
<p>Holy Family Institute reported retaining 345 jobs under the program after receiving at least $2 million in aid.</p>
<p>“Though Holy Family Institute is a Catholic organization, last year alone our 18 social service programs reached over 40,000 children and families of all faiths and backgrounds,” said Michael A. Sexauer, chief operating officer of the Emsworth-based organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“While we did lay off some staff before applying for the loan, we were able to start calling people back in June and hope to be back to pre-pandemic staffing levels this fall if schools open,” he said.</p>
<p>The SBA itself doesn’t categorize any of the recipients as being religious, but by reviewing the list of nonprofit recipients, the Post-Gazette identified 175 in the region with some faith connection, recognizing that “faith-based” means widely different things to different organizations.</p>
<p>The SBA database also had other limitations, such as identifying loans in broad ranges, such as between $350,000 and $1 million, meaning that total estimates are also in ranges rather than precise amounts. Also, recipients of less than $150,000, which surely include faith-based employers, are not identified by name.</p>
<p>Using a broader definition of faith-based, the Post-Gazette also identified 34 charities and 17 nursing homes or other residential and health-care agencies. Many of these incorporate their faith history or values in their mission statements while primarily offering community services.</p>
<p>But even these missions range widely. Urban missions in Pittsburgh and Washington place a premium on Christian discipleship. Others cite their faith heritage as a motive to serve but do not proselytize. Area YMCAs seek to put “Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for all,” while the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh creates “an environment rooted in Jewish values that strengthens the physical, intellectual and spiritual well-being of individuals and families.”</p>
<p>Cathy Samuels of the JCC said the Payroll Protection Program had a dramatic benefit.</p>
<p>“We tried to do everything we could in our power to salvage the most staff,” she said.</p>
<p>But after three weeks into the pandemic, the JCC could no longer compensate its part-time employees, and it furloughed or reduced hours for most full-timers. The program enabled them it to recall full-time workers and gradually recall many part-time ones, she sad.</p>
<p>“As of today, the JCC continues to retain all of its full-time employees and regularly scheduling many of its part-time employees though not at the pre-COVID levels,” she said.</p>
