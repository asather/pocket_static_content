<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’d be hard to find two neighboring small towns more pleasant for a day trip than Harmony and Zelienople in Butler County. Two of their many charms, the Harmony Museum and Zelienople Historical Society, have cooked up a creative way to encourage people to visit during the coronavirus pandemic: a scavenger hunt.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;“Hunt for History Scavenger Hunt” for families and groups runs from Thursday through Sept. 8. Booklets sell for $20 and cover up to four people, who can walk to 10 destinations in the two towns. Participants receive discounts at more than a dozen eateries and if they complete the hunt, they’re entered in a drawing for a&nbsp;“grand prize basket.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>For hunters who are really are into history,&nbsp;there are 10 additional places to find.</p>
<p>“And it can all be done while social distancing,” says Harmony Museum President&nbsp;Rodney Gasch.&nbsp;“I hope this gives Pittsburghers a fun reason to head north.”</p>
<p>Participating businesses include the&nbsp;Harmony Inn, Bottlebrush Gallery, Harmonie Laden, Wunderbar Coffee &amp; Crepes, Lost Dog Records, Lagerhaus Bakery, Linden Tree Antiques, Union Brothers Brewing, Kaufman Tavern,&nbsp;Della Terra,&nbsp;Burg’hers,&nbsp;Goodfello’s,&nbsp;ShuBrew, the new General Shu’s,&nbsp;Vocelli Pizza and&nbsp;Spring &amp; Main Cafe.</p>
<p>Booklets can be purchased through Sept. 4 at the Harmony Museum Shop (222 Mercer St., 16037) and Zelienople Historical Society (243 S. Main St., 16063) and online&nbsp;at <a href="https://harmonymuseum.org" target="_blank">harmonymuseum.org</a>. There is a $1 charge to mail the booklet. Learn more at <a href="https://harmonymuseum.org" target="_blank">harmonymuseum.org</a> or <a href="https://www.zeliehistory.org" target="_blank">zeliehistory.org</a>.</p>
