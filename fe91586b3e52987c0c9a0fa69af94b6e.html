<h1>Where to buy tomatoes and other vegetable plants </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Lettuce and spinach may be growing already, but the real push to plant vegetables is a couple of weeks away, when the soil is warmer.</p>
<p>Most nurseries are considered essential, especially those growing agricultural crops. Some are open, some are handling orders for pickup only, and some are doing both to allow for minimal contact with the public. All nurseries are required to follow state and national COVID-19 rules requiring masks, maintaining social distance and limiting the number of customers indoors at any given time.</p>
<p>We caught up with local growers to find out which vegetables they’re excited about this growing season. Before making the trip, you should call and confirm times and policies. Also check their websites to see longer lists of vegetables and herbs that are available. All of the nurseries below are currently open to the public, with a few exceptions as noted.</p>
