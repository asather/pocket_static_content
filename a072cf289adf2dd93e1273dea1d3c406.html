<h1>Ray Fittipaldo's and Brian Batko's 2020 NFL draft chat transcript: 04.23.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Welcome to our draft chat. The queue is open so get your questions in.</p>
<p><strong>DaquidoBazzini</strong>: I’ve seen two very different opinions today (from experienced media guys that cover the Steelers in Pittsburgh) in regards to the Steelers extending/resigning Juju before next year. What’s your opinion? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I think they're going to take care of Cam Heyward first and I'm not sure if they'll be able to do JuJu as well. They could, but they could also let him play out the season and deal with a new contract next spring/summer. Remember the Steelers can use the franchise tag on JuJu so they can control him for another year and try to get something done.</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: will the rooneys try to dump ben and his contract off to another team or keep paying him for producing only 3 playoff wins in 11 years <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Dang, what happened to all the optimism the draft brings? The truth is they're married to Ben for two more years for better or worse. And after last season, I think it will be better if he's healthy. He might not be the ol' gunslinger, but he doesn't have to be with this defense.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Let there be a Run on QBs in tonights Draft. Hoping to get an Awesome RB and WR tomorrow in 2&amp;3 <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: QBs and offensive tackles. I think you'll see four QBs go in Round 1 tonight. And I think you'll see 6 or 7 offensive tackles as well. That's 11 players, and we haven't even discussed receivers or or defensive players. Definitely something to watch tonight.</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: dang, he only has 1 touchdown pass in 2 super bowl wins !!!!!!!! am i missing something? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: You're right. He stinks. I don't suppose he played well against the Colts or Broncos in 2005</p>
<p><strong>Baghdad_Ben</strong>: Are you as eager as I am to see the end to the Jalen Hurts to th Steelers speculation? Makes no sense from several angles. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: It doesn't make sense to me either. But he won't go in the first round so you might have to hear about it again tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>Super Dave</strong>: Why did the Dolphins trade Minkah? Seems strange. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: According to reports out of Miami he didn't like the way the Dolphins used him so they decided to put him on the trade block. He was always diplomatic when he was asked about it last season even after the Steelers beatthe Dolphins at Heinz Field.</p>
<p><strong>Smoke</strong>: I believe Schuster and Johnson are great number 2 receivers. Is there a number one in the third round ... and do we need one with two great tight ends? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I'd remind you JuJu had over 1,400 yards when Roethlisberger was healthy. I know he had Antonio Brown by his side, but I'm not going to say he's not a true No. 1. Let's see how he bounces back this year. He was without Roethlisberger for most of the year, and he was dealing with injuries. As for the two "great" tight ends. They have one Pro Bowl appearances between them. Maybe good?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert’s Lunatics</strong>: Do you see Edmunds moving to hybrid role if we go safety in round 2 or 3? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I think that could happen. I interviewed Rod Woodson earlier this week, and he thinks Edmunds might be better suited to play the hybrid LB role. Mark Barron made a similar move relatively early in his career. He was drafted as a safety and moved to ILB/hybrid. But as you point out they'd have to find a safety to play deep. Don't think they have one on the roster now capable of doing it unless they think Cam Sutton can make the move.</p>
<p><strong>Seattle Art</strong>: I like Akers from FSU. Do you think we actually have a legitmate shot at 49? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Yes I think there is a good chance he is there at 49. On average over the past decade only 2 or 3 backs get selected in the first 50 picks. You might even see Jonathan Taylor or JK Dobbins on the board at 49. I think Swift from Georgia will be the first RB off the board.</p>
<p><strong>Showdog</strong>: Is there any chance the Steerlers surprise us and move up into the 1st round tonigh. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Just don't have the ammunition this year. Next pick after 49 is 102. Not unless they package picks from next year's draft, and I doubt another GM will make that swap.</p>
<p><strong>DormontDirtbag</strong>: Having watched LSU reruns from their games last season against Bama and Clemson, my takeaways were that LB Queen and S Delpit miss ALOT of tackles and that Clyde Edwards -Helaire (sp?) is a gamer unfazed by big game pressure. Your thoughts on the Tigers? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Lots of good players from LSU. They should have a bunch of guys taken in the first round. CEH is a really good back. I think he's going to be really good in the NFL. Not sure if he's right for the Steelers because of his stature and the way the Steelers ask their backs to stay in for pass pro on occasion. Delpit had a bit of a down year after a better year in 2018. Should be a good night for the Tigers.</p>
<p><strong>Steelers 2020</strong>: I'm JuJu Smith-Schuster, my agent told me I'm worth $16M a year. What are my chances being paid like a #1 WR in 2021? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Pretty good if the Steelers use the franchise tag.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: The Steelers appear to be in a "win-now" mentality with the uncharacteristic - for them - Bush and Minkah moves. After several years, they once again have an excellent defense! With this type of defense, I think the Steelers could still contend even if Ben can't return or is injured again IF they had a decent backup (no, Rudolph is clearly not the answer). Given how talented their defense is, isn't it basically malpractice to go into a season without a backup who gives them a chance to win games? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>:</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://my.post-gazette.com/purchase/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=steelers" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2018/08/06/steelers-subscribe-banner-1" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Al Davis</strong>: How about we draft a guy or two who will be a starter and help win now baby rather than a backup who could help next year or in case of an injury? <br> <strong>Guest</strong>: Not a draft thought but more food for thought - Steelers had bad luck the past few years that could not have been foreseen. One of the best running backs gives up a year at the peak of his career, one of the best receivers goes nuts, and one of the best linebackers has an injury that ends his career. These freak events as much as anything has meant some lost seasons, don’t you think? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Good points. Other teams have personnel problems, but I agree with you some of those were hard to foresee. I don't think anyone believed Bell would take the stance he did. You can make the argument they coddled Brown and created some of their own misfortune with him. Like Mike Tomlin says, 'The Standard is the Standard.'</p>
<p><strong>Steelers 2020</strong>: Bud Dupree just signed his Franchise Tag today, the day of the Draft. Would you be shocked if the Steelers made a trade shipping Dupree out for multiple picks? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: That would surprise me. He was a big part of that defense. They wanted him back so they could make a run with a healthy Roethlisberger.</p>
<p><strong>Buster smith</strong>: Does Jonathan Taylor go in round 1 and if still available should Steelers take him in the mid 2nd? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Hey Buster, I don't think he'll go in Round 1. More likely early to middle of Round 2. And yes, if he's there the Steelers would strongly consider him.</p>
<p><strong>Here We Go</strong>: If people are unhappy with Conner's fumble problem why is there so much love for Jonathan Taylor's 15 fumbles? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Well, Taylor's fumbles haven't cost the Steelers any games. Ha ha. Sure, it's a concern, but he had a lot of touches at Wisconsin, and I think some of that can be cleaned up with coaching.</p>
<p><strong>Seattle Art</strong>: Curious on your take with Devin Bush? It seemed to me most of his tackles came in pursuit versus anticipation of where the play was designed to go. Am I wrong about that and if I am right, do you see the ability for him to progress in year two? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: For sure he'll be better in Year 2. He was thrown into the fire as a rookie and played pretty well. He made some big plays, INTS, fumble recoveries, etc. Can he clean some things up with his game? Yeah. But the Steelers are very excited about him.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: I agree with many who feel the Steelers could use a RB or WR with pick #49. Even with a healthy Ben, we saw how the offense struggled without AB against the Bengals at the end of 2018. While we all know that no rookie will instantly be as good as AB, I think that that the Steelers need a WR at #49 who can help open up the field for the other receivers more than a RB? Do you agree? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: If it's the right receiver yeah, but don't discount how much a good RB can change that offense. Le'Veon Bell was a pretty big part of those prolific offenses from 2014-17. If they do take a receiver it needs to be a fast/quick guy that can threaten the defense with his speed and playmaking ability.</p>
<p><strong>DormontDirtbag</strong>: Juju, D. Johnson, J. Washington, and Jalen Raegor line up as WRs. Cam Akers as the lone RB. #7 at QB. Is there a better skill position lineup in the NFC North? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Yeah but Akers won't last until 102. But you;re right. That would be a pretty nice setup for the offense.</p>
<p><strong>SWVA Stiller</strong>: I love VWs ability to stuff the run and blitz but surely we will draft, trade for or sign a veteran FA to fill Barron’s role (or Edmunds’ if he takes Barrons spot)? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I think so yes. Ulysees Gilbert is a possibility, but he ended his rookie season on IR with a back injury. And he only played special teams when he was healthy. Maybe they're waiting to see how the draft unfolds. If they can get a safety in Round 3 that can potentially start as a rookie then maybe they'd be inclined to move Edmunds into the hybrid role. Or maybe they'd like a hybrid in Round 3.</p>
<p><strong>SWVA Stiller</strong>: First, I’m not on the Jalen Hurts to the Steelers bandwagon. I’ve seen multiple Dak comparisons. If I knew 100% he would be Dak 2.0 when BB retires in 2 years, I still wouldn’t take him in round 2 or 3. I say get weapons to try and send BB off with one more ring. Agree? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I agree. There's just no way of knowing what Hurts will be in the NFL. Projecting QBs from today's college game to the NFL is so hard.</p>
<p><strong>Here We Go</strong>: Which non-QB is the biggest faller in this year's draft? Who is the riser? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Laviska Shenault from Colorado is a first-round talent but apparently there are some injury concerns. He could fall. (By the way, if he falls to 49 the Steelers should grab him. He's really good.). Really, anyone with an injury history or an injury that wasn't able to be fully evaluated by teams could fall. That's going to happen in this draft because teams don't have all the medical information they desire. As for risers, I keep hearing about Ezra Cleveland from Boise State getting into Round 1. I don't get it. I watched him. Decent prospect, but a lot of projection there.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: I should have written this earlier, but thanks for doing this chat Ray. I appreciate your insight. The Leonard Fournette situation with Jacksonville has given talk show hosts lots of content over the past few days. What are your thoughts about the Steelers acquiring him? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I'd rather get a back in this draft and have control of him for four years. But if they don't get the back they want then maybe they'd consider trading a late-round pick in 2021 to the Jaguars if they're willing to wait til next year to get their pick.</p>
<p><strong>Here We Go</strong>: I forgot to thank you for the chat. This is much better than listening to the talking heads. <br> <strong>Cubby</strong>: Was it a mistake keeping Foster so long that we lost Finney? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Honestly, I think they viewed Finney as a quality backup and nothing more. That's the way they treated him. They had a chance to sign him to a long-term deal when he was a RFA in 2018. But they went out and signed Foster to another deal. At that point the writing was on the wall for Finney.</p>
<p><strong>Tampa Too</strong>: A little off topic but since the draft hasn’t started yet. What’s the latest on Ryan Shazier? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Not much to update. He continues to rehab and the Steelers want him to continue to be a part of the organization. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi everyone. Checking in from the Batko house. Wife is on a Zoom call with friends, I just poured a cold drink and lit a candle. Let's enjoy one of the great nights of the year for draft nerds. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Only mistake I made was not getting pizza for tonight. Might have to rectify that for Day 2 or 3.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: I got my drink and am ready too BB - lets get it on <br> <strong>Chuck from Michigan</strong>: Steelers like and selected a lot of Big Ten players the last several years. Who from Big Ten do you like at RB/LB/OL with picks in Rounds 2/3/4? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Jonathan Taylor from Wisconsin is a possibility in Round 2. Michigan has a lot of prospects that will go in those middle rounds. Josh Uche is a LB. I'm not sure how he'd fit into the Steelers defense though. He's kind of a tweener. Bredeson, the guard, is a possibility in the third round or after. Hudson from McKeesport is a late-round guy. Ohio State always has good prospects. They have a guard, Jonah Jackson, that should go in the middle rounds. Iowa has a few like Geon Stone (New Castle. He's a safety. That's a few off the top of my head.</p>
<p><strong>Ratville</strong>: What happened to the Pats being punished for spying? I kept hearing the NFL was going to come down hard on them for spying again and all of the poof everything is appeared about that story? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Definitely been quiet on that front. The punishment probably should have been a draft pick. Maybe they're waiting until the social distancing thing is over to issue their punishment. Or maybe there won't be one.</p>
<p><strong>Clarence Johnson</strong>: What are your thoughts on the trade rumors with Juju? would you make a trade if the price was right? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Clarence, that rumor was bunk from the get-go, as far as I can tell. It originated from an account called @nflrum0rs which I've never heard of, has no website and no track record. And yet, of course people ran with it and it got legs. Go figure. That's the Internet in 2020. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: JuJu is one of their top players on offense. They've always endured the loss of Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell the past two years. So no, I'm not entertaining that trade offer when I only have two years left with my franchise QB. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Nice opening to the telecast by Peyton Manning.</p>
<p><strong>CD in SC</strong>: Why on earth do we still have Berry as our punter? There has to be a better one somewhere on this plant. Do you see them using a late round pick on one? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: No. Only six picks. Too many other needs to fill. They'll bring in an nudrafted free agent though. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Bengals, Dolphins, Patriots (maybe), Packers (maybe). Saints (maybe). Chargers (maybe). Raiders (maybe). There are probably others too.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: The media over-hypes the QB's to create conflict and a story, do you really think 4 QB's will go in the first. Who will take them? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Sorry, there is the question to previous answer. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'd just like to say "Chase Young" is an elite football name in my opinion. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: And that Roger Goodell's apartment smells of rich mahogany.</p>
<p><strong>Gambler</strong>: What will be the first trade? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I kind of think there's going to be fewer trades this year given the uncertainty of doing it virtually, etc. Just a hunch but we'll see. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Welcome Brian.</p>
<p><strong>Gambler</strong>: The answer is Miami <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Get a load of this guy. Gambler answered is his own question.</p>
<p><strong>DormontDirtbag</strong>: I remember when the draft was Pete Rozelle, a podium, and a few cameras. Now it's Peyton Manning (who by many accounts is a real tool away from the camera) reciting a bad, self-congratulating soliloquy. They make it harder every year to be an NFL fan. Am I wrong or just old? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I'm old enough to remember when Super Bowls didn't have 45-minute halftime shows. Unfortunately, it's that way with all sports now. Everything is a big production.</p>
<p><strong>Tampa Too</strong>: And how much do you wanna bet it takes Cincinnati the full 10 minutes to make their selection known. Even though they’ve had over three months to decide <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Yep. It's still even a TV show. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Dr. Fauci!</p>
<p><strong>Impatient</strong>: Is this going to start tonight? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Working to confirm. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Pretty bland room at Zac Taylor's home. Fitting for the bengals.</p>
<p><strong>The Ham</strong>: The best was when Rozelle would take a drag off a cigarette and then go to the podium to announce a pick <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: And Dr. Z was on the telecast!</p>
<p><strong>CD in SC</strong>: What percentage do you give the Steelers for bringing back Barron? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: In honor of his jersey number, 2.6% <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: These social distancing draft parties are going to be depressing!</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: It’s pretty sad to be watching people sitting in front of their computer screens..... <br> <strong>James</strong>: And the draft used to be all day on a Tuesday. I cut school to watch it. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Joe Burrow with just his parents in the room. No way people can accuse him of not social distancing. This kid IS polished. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I'm not that old, but I have fond memories of my gym teacher rolling a TV into the gymnasium and letting us watch Pitt on Big East tournament games.</p>
<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: what are the chances the bengals are taking the wrong guy. Could take chase young and go sign newton or winston <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nah, I really like the idea of having a chance to get the clear-cut No. 1 QB who also happens to be the hometown kid. Your idea is logical, but this franchise needs a savior right now.</p>
<p><strong>CD in SC</strong>: Is Booger under contract again for MNF? Worst commentator in history. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Good question. I thought I read somewhere they were looking to change the talent in the booth. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Bengals GM Duke Tobin's room looks pretty tricked out! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Also, if you'd have asked me the name of Cincy's GM before two minutes ago, I'd come up blank, and I cover the division.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: This is like Groundhog Day for me. Hi Ray and Brian. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Welcome Jerry! Just like old times.</p>
<p><strong>CD in SC</strong>: Any prediction on who the Browns take at 10? Never mind, it will be the wrong pick again. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: People can use any name in these chats. How do we know this is really you, Jerry? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I'll say offensive tackle.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Hello intern. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That'll play.</p>
<p><strong>DormontDirtbag</strong>: Jerry Micco! Where you been? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Jerry is still at the PG!</p>
<p><strong>Karma</strong>: The Browns take Cleveland <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Cowboys take Miami RB DeeJay Dallas, Steelers take WR Michael Pittman. I get it. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Joe Burrow is the pick.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Reading Ray and Brian's coverage of the team. I'm now in charge of the Sunday paper and political coverage. These guys are doing all the work now. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Good poll question.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Ok, predictions. First team to trade down? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: So hard to predict this year. Maybe the Dolphins.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Lions should trade down. <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: browns will pick Booger McFarland at #10 <br> <strong>DormontDirtbag</strong>: I agree w/ Jerry. Matt Patricia and the Lions. <br> <strong>James</strong>: Agree. Lions. <br> <strong>Gambler</strong>: really smart guy said Miami <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: RIP Kenny Rogers</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: If the Chargers and Miami both want Tua, then the Chargers need to get ahead of them. Lions, if they want a CB, can move down 3 spots. <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Though Detroit might want to take Simmons. Better player overall. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Simmons is going to be such an interesting player to watch in the NFL. He can play safety, ILB, even edge. Crazy versatility. Just what NFL coaches are looking for.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Ok....so Washington picks chase young right? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Yep <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Isaiah Simmons stood out to me every time I watched Clemson. Dude was everywhere</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Jerry - Agree with Simmons. He is a BEAST <br> <strong>DormontDirtbag</strong>: Simmons may be best player in draft. <br> <strong>Carl</strong>: draft math question: According to the draft chart, pick 49 is worth 410 points, Say Green Bay wanted to move up, they have pick 62 and 94 which totals 408 according to the chart. Would you do it? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Covering the combine for the first time two months ago, I didn't eat at the famed St. Elmo Steakhouse but I did pop in on a Thursday night and who walks in? Chase Young. He can afford a few steak dinners now. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I would not. I think you can get a good player at 49. If there is no one you want there then maybe if you think the guy will be there at 62.</p>
<p><strong>Ed</strong>: Brian/Ray - Thank you doing this... will you keep us posted tonight (live) if you feel the pucks coming in are favorable or non-favorable for our Steelers going into their first pick tomorrow? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Our pleasure Ed, thanks for joining. The Redskins picking Chase Young at 2 is unfavorable to the Steelers in my opinion. He's really good.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: St. Elmo's: I cry when I eat the shrimp cocktail. Hottest sauce ever. <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: BB....you didnt eat at St Elmos ? That's like a Felony in Indy...... <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: I think the Lions will pick with 10 seconds left. I have to believe they are fielding a lot of calls. Jacksonville should give up some picks here if they want a QB. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I ate at Harry &amp; Izzy's next door, which everyone tells me is essentially the same meal. They had the cocktail sauce. It was fantastic. You can make a similar concoction at Eddie V's in Pittsburgh if you mix a bit of their atomic horseradish with the cocktail. Life hack!</p>
<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: I think the eagles miss out on top wr in round 1. Would you trade 49 for 53 and get one of the 4th round picks they have <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I'd try to get a third-round pick</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Harry and Izzy's is the same. you did fine <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Lions pick is in, but they're going to make us wait until after the commercial apparently. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Maybe not. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Jeff Okudah is the pick <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It's a run on Buckeyes. Do Giants go JK Dobbins here to pair with Saquon?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: So the best tackle goes to the Giants? Or do they see if someone's willing to trade up ahead of Miami to take one of the QBs? Wirfs is a very good player, but you might get him a few picks lower. Maybe. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I think they go tackle here. Protect the young QB and help Barkley. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I didn't bother watching much of the top OL prospects in this draft, but when I put on Michigan LB Josh Uche vs. Iowa, I found myself wondering if anyone ever manages to beat Tristan Wirfs.</p>
<p><strong>TD</strong>: History tells us at least 1 of these top 5 picks will be a bust. How is that possible with them being elite athletes and all the research done on them? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: It's HARD to play in the NFL! So much more goes into it than athleticism, 40 times, etc.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Wirfs is an Athletic Freak. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Love Wirfs.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: If he drops to #49 I say we should pick wirfs... ;-) <br> <strong>Lenny</strong>: Ray thoughts on safety Blackmon from Utah? He can play in the slot too and free up Edmonds to play the nickel backer role. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Like him. Versatile. Knee injury is a owrry, but he could be ready for the season. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Dave Gettleman's draft room reminds me of our fantasy football drafts growing up. Always had 'em at my friend Gabe's house, and it was always a fight who got to sit at the desktop computer. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Whoa. Andrew Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Joe Judge has a great dog. <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Wow, that's a bit high for Thomas. <br> <strong>Nitro</strong>: Where did you have him ranked Ray in position <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The OL projections have been all over the place since the combine. Feels like all of Jedrick Wills, Tristan Wirfs, Andrew Thomas and Mekhi Becton have been considered the top guy at various points. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: fourth among the tackles i think</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Haha why is gettelman wearing a mask IN HIS OWN HOUSE? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Can never be too careful, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: Ray which guard do you take in round 4? Simpson, Dotson, kindley or Lemeuix <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Of those four I like Simpson</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: He's trying to hide from the Thomas pick. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Dolphins take Tua</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Ugh. The Commish butchered his last name. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Maybe he can hear the boos from Hawaii</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: I think chargers go herbert now. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Yeah I agree. Can't ride with Tyrod Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Chargers HAVE to go Herbert <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Justin Herbert just looks like a Chargers quarterback to me.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: You know, if I'm the Chargers, I look hard at Simmons or maybe Wirfs. If you have money to spend, talk to Winston. <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: You're right, Brian. Dan Fouts, while not as big, just has that look. Rivers did, too. <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: lol. the commissioner SLAYED Tua's name worse than he slayed Mariota's name a few years back.<br> Good God <br> <strong>Nitro</strong>: Most likely surprise early pick in Round 1 - name of player and team please. Has to be a QB right? <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Yeah...chargers have a lot of experience with a QB who likes to turn the ball over in the clutch in the past 2 decades <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: @Nitro: Gonna go out on a limb and say DL Raekwon Davis. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Too bad Rivers didn't play for them in 1994. Ha ha</p>
<p><strong>DormontDirtbag</strong>: No WRs or RBs taken yet. Everything falling Steelers' way. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: So far.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Good Observation DormontDirtBag <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: WRs start around 11 and then it'll be a run on them. <br> <strong>Dude</strong>: Jerry is right - take Wirfs or Simmons and then go after a qb elsewhere <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: I think someone is going to take rb taylor in the 1st. 4.3 rbs who were productive in college usually don’t last too long <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: You might be right. Swift probably first RB off the board, but Taylor is in that late first- or early second-round range. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Chargers take Herbert <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Must say, ESPN is doing a great job with this presentation. Much better than some of the shows I was half-watching earlier today.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Hypothetical question, I know we will most likely go offense with their first pick, but say a great value pick is there on inside or outside linebacker or safety, which is the most area of need do you believe the Steelers need <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: The hybrid LB. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Almost looks like Herbert is wearing a bolo tie in honor of Phil Rivers.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Yeah I am trying to figure out what station to watch online from. ESPN has the best one right now but picks are delayed <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: So 3 QBs taken in top 6. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Now here does Love go?</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: I like love to jax <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Could be although they seem to like Minschew. But I might be with you.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: I think Love drops some. Carolina looking DL here: Derrick Brown? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Panthers have a number of holes to fill, but Derrick Brown is a beast.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Jac already ditched foles. No way they can possibly think minshew is the answer. And i think carolina stays in the carolinas and replaces kuechly with simmons <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Good point. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah I'm thinking Jordan Love to the Jaguars, if he goes at all tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: just here hoping Simmons don't go to Clevelans <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I don;t think Simmons falls to 10.</p>
<p><strong>Gambler</strong>: Still waiting for that first trade.,.,where are you Dolphins? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I think Brian was right.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Why aren't the networks doing interviews with players after the selections? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Good question. I was under the impression they had the setup to do all that, but it appears not. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Derrick Brown to the Panthers.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: yep. Brown. So far, no surprises <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Arizona has to go OL here <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Cards have the cream of OL to pick from: Wirfs, Wills, Becton. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Simmons to the Cards. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Huh. Didn't see that one coming. First pick I've really been surprised by.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Hard to pass on him. I don't think they'll be disappointed. <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: oh boy....they went simmons. Good Call. He is a monster. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Uffff.. Great Simmons of the Board.. <br> <strong>Critic</strong>: Booger back on MNF would make canceling the season easier to accept <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: So we have Jax and then the Browns. I think Browns definitely go OT.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: I guess arizona is fine with getting their #1 overall qb getting killed <br> <strong>Lenny</strong>: would you trade a 2021 4th and Conner for fournette? Can go wr at 49(claypool or Pittman) . <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Personally, I would. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Simmons can be a difference maker though.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: The team that benefits from this is the Browns. They are going to get a better tackle than Becton. Wirfs or Wills. <br> <strong>Nitro</strong>: Which network did Drew Brees sign with? Is that Big Ben's next career? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Brees to NBC. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: And I'm not sure Ben would want to do that. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Max</strong>: Worst pick so far. <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: New orleans would be as far as love falls. Brees did NO a favor telling them he gas 1 year left <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Payton seems to love Taysom Hill. But you might be right. At the very least they could see what they have in Love and have them compete.</p>
<p><strong>Td</strong>: I would trade all of my 2021 picks for picks this year. Probably won't be a college season anyway. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: If there is no college season in the fall the 2021 draft is going to be nuts! <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Jags take C.J. Henderson.</p>
<p><strong>Cranberry Steve</strong>: Is it just me, or is the Steelers roster so thin at so MANY positions that we seems to be back in "best player available" mode? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Best within reason, Steve. I don't see them taking a QB, TE or CB at 49. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: So Browns have to go Bechton, Wills or Wirfs here.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Wirfs to Browns. Jets go OL too? <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Yeah...a lot of states have cancelled school until 2021, so college FB would be cancelled with that. Idk what the draft would look like in 2021. Maybe cancelled <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Just scout off 2019 tape?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: It'll be their new Joe Thomas pick. <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Jets will go WR, I think. <br> <strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: Now this is where things get interesting <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: CJ Henderson to the Jags was pretty interesting. Can't say I expected that.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Browns Should go Wirfs but will go WR instead <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: I think once the Jets pick, you will see WRs flying off the board. <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Browns: Wills or Wirfs. A WR sits behind OJB and Landry. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Browns take Wills <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Browns need a left tackle. Wirfs played right at Iowa. So did Jedrick Wills, but for a left-handed QB. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Wills is really good. That's a good pick.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: WR run starts at 11 <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: agreed Jerry. Run on WRs is coming <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Went with Wills to Cleveland in my AFC North draft primer last week. So I'm now 2 for 2 if you're keeping track at home: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/16/afc-north-nfl-draft-2020-steelers-ravens-bengals-browns-predictions-joe-burrow-cincinnati/stories/202004160037" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/16/afc-north-nfl-...</a></p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: As I said earlier, they benefit from the Giants taking Thomas. <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: I like Jerry Jeudy here for NYJ. I like him better than CeeDee Lamb. <br> <strong>Dude</strong>: Great job BB - trying to score at home <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: Do the Pats take Love or Eason? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Who knows with Belichick? He might think he can win with Hoyer or Stidham</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Talking about WRs, I don’t think there’s much of a chance Reagor makes it to us at 49 after his pro day. 4.22/4.28 ran him probably to the end of the 1st <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I've seen Reagor late 1 and late 2. Seems to be some differing opinions on him.</p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: Biggest surprise pick so far? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Thomas for me. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Henderson that high</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: That's a good call, Brian. I didn't think he was a top 10 guy. <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Thomas at 4. <br> <strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: Agree on Henderson. That was interesting, but the Jags have so many needs. <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: If the Jets do decide to take Wirfs here, Raiders have their choice of WRs. Gruden has to be pretty pleased here. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I can see the Jets going kicker here.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: With nobody to physically restrain him, what kind of bonehead move will Jerry Jones make? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: That could be epic</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: maybe 3 WRs in a row here...? <br> <strong>Michael</strong>: you really think they would waste a pick on a kicker? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Nah <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Jets take Bechton <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Oh my God there's a dude who is bigger than Bechton in that house! <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: That man had to be 5 bills</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Ray: 4 bills? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: 5!</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: What is up with Wirfs fall? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Some people think Wirfs will be a guard. Guards don't usually go as high as tackles. But I think Wirfs can play either in the NFL. He won't last long unless there is some issue we don;t know about.</p>
<p><strong>Mark from VA Beach</strong>: Surprised the Cardinals passed on Cee Dee Lamb? Seems like he would have been a nice fit with Murray since they played at Oklahoma together. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Kyler Murray's cousin is Texas WR Devin Duvernay. Maybe they're going to wait on wideout.</p>
<p><strong>Mark from VA Beach</strong>: Gruden is licking his lips with all these WRs dropping. <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: Here comes a WR for the Raiders <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: i think CD to raiders <br> <strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: I miss watching playoff hockey and then just flipping over to watch the picks I cared about. But it was worth it to see Becton's massive family. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I miss that too. Always Pen-Caps in the media room at UPMC facility. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: High risk high reward pick. Classic Jets. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Raiders go with Henry Ruggs. Al Davis must have phoned in the pick</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Ray: remember the Pens-Flyers game years ago? Wasn't that he Talbot fight game? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I was at my old apartment for the Pens-Flyers game I think. I don't think I was the facility that day.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: hey-bey all over again! <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Classic raider pick. Is al davis still alive??? <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: lol - Al Davis love for speed lives on <br> <strong>Josh</strong>: Godwin, Evans, Gronk, OJ Howard, Jerry Jeudy? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Henry Ruggs wearing a robe. Best pick of the night. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Looks like Gruden has a son who is a lookalike. Little Chucky.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Is Ruggs in a Beverly Hills Hotel robe? <br> <strong>Ed</strong>: Eddie Murphy gifted it to him... <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Well, the 49ers should take Jeudy here. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I think they'll go Jeudy or Lamb. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sounds like the 49ers are trading this pick to Tampa.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Like he did he 2 cops at the end of he movie. One of my favorites. <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: after they showed ruggs’ highlights, he doesn’t look like he runs 4.2 with pads <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I don't know. He's pretty fast. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: So do this mean the Bucs are trading up for the last elite OL, Tristan Wirfs, or one of these WRs? Have to assume it's Wirfs.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Hmmm. Tampa moves into SF spot. Wirfs? <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: Bucs taking another WR for Brady <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: They have 2 terrific WRs in Godwin and Evans. I gotta think it's Wirfs. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Maybe they'll throw us all off and go defense.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: I hope you are right <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Man...TB really thinking they’re NE moving around the draft <br> <strong>Josh</strong>: Why do teams trade up one pick? SF would've taken a WR <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Staley getting old too.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: De'Andre Swift would be an alternate pick. <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: TB has to take a OT to protect the old G.O.A.T <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Bucs take Wirfs <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Guess they were afriad the 49ers were going to need a tackle to replace Staley.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Bruce Arians doesnt mess around <br> <strong>rman</strong>: Just got here. Anything noteworthy happen? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Not until the recent trade with 49ers and Bucs. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: And Ruggs to the Raiders.</p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: Bruce Arians is chillin' on the porch lol <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: If the Wirfs family and Becton families got together for Thanksgiving, it would be a turkey massacre. <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Or they were afraid someone else would move up and grab wirfs. Pull a bungles taking william jackson on em <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: 49ers will take Jeudy or Lamb here. A weapon for Jimmy G. <br> <strong>Dude</strong>: JM showed up and BB is 2 for 2 <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Might see those 2 WRs go back to back. Broncos need a WR, too. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Got Courtland Sutton last year but yeah they lost E Sanders last year too when they traded him away</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Jeudy had 2x the catches, 2x the yards, and higher career YPC than Ruggs. He must be thrilled that Ruggs went first b/c of how fast he ran in shorts <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: There are some injury concerns with Jeudy. I read about them this week. Knee and arthritis is a possibility. Shame for him if he falls due to that. He was a great player at Bama</p>
<p><strong>TX Steeler</strong>: When do we think first RB comes off the board? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Dolphins have another pick in the 20s. They could use a RB.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: To me, Jeudy is a can't miss. I like Lamb, too, but Jeudy is great out of the slot. All-around good WR. <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: Yes I think the Dolphins take Swift <br> <strong>Guest</strong>: Lateral meniscus on Jeudy is a ‘nothing’ injury. He was best WR at Bama with 4 first rounders at wr there <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: if jax trades fournette, they may want a RB too <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: True</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Thoughts on ESPN’s coverage? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It's been good. Barely different than any other draft, to me.</p>
<p><strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: Unless the Dolphins love one particular RB, there's a chance they could even wait til their first pick in the 2nd round. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: 49ers take Kinlaw. Wow</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: ok. that was a surprise too. <br> <strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: That tops Henderson for most surprising. Wow. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'm not surprised by that one. 49ers traded DeForest Buckner to the Colts for a first, and now they'll replace him with a younger, cheaper lineman. They're a smart franchise.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I guess deep WR class means value isn't there. Pick a position where there is a big drop-off after the top couple <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: There will be a run on receivers eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Welp, 49ers did need a dt after trading buckner <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: That's a good call, Brian. I forgot they traded Buckner. <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: yep. smart move avoiding the easy trap to pick a flashy receiver. This is a really good pick by the Niners <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Crazy so many WR still on the board. Everyone thinking they can get one later really working out for us <br> <strong>W</strong>: One site had an article but its removed now about Dupree possibly being a trade target? Is that getting any traction? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I don't think so. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Broncos go with Jeudy</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: That wasn’t a surprise <br> <strong>SteelFalcon58</strong>: Who do y’all have the Falcons taking? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Falcons could go WR too. Maybe edge. Chaisson from LSU?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Too early for Gross-Matos? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Maybe but Falcons have been searching for a pass rush for years.</p>
<p><strong>SteelFalcon58</strong>: They need edge help! <br> <strong>Nitro</strong>: Eagles, VIkings, Packers all take WR in Rd1? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: You might be right, Nitro.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Falcons go Kristian Fulton - CB <br> <strong>George</strong>: i Just disagree with the eagles though <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: The Falcons drafted Vic Beasley in 2014. He was supposed to be their answer to a pass rusher. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Then Takk McKinley, and he only plays on passing downs. Kind of a disappointment too.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Actually, it was 2015. <br> <strong>George</strong>: I think falcons are going to go with WR to be honest I think Julio Jones days are over <br> <strong>SteelFalcon58</strong>: Deep WR draft. Good qbs in NFC south <br> <strong>George</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">yeah the draft is going to be filled with wideouts</span> <br> <strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: Trade-up coming soon for some team wanting Lamb? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Falcons take CB AJ Terrell.</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: I didn’t see that one coming <br> <strong>Ed</strong>: Loving it for Steelers!!! <br> <strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: Got smoked by LSU, but a lot of people did I suppose. <br> <strong>SteelFalcon58</strong>: Hometown boy <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: I think that's a reach. Atlanta native, so I can see why his family is so happy. <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: so far this draft is falling favorably for the Steelers. <br> <strong>SteelFalcon58</strong>: Agree Jerry. Disappointing <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Cowboys need a pass rusher, so maybe Chaisson here or Gross-Matos. <br> <strong>Nitro</strong>: Brian, Jerry and Ray - Thoughts on Mike McCarthy- Over-rated? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Beat the Steelers when it counted. Came up short after that. A little like Tomlin, but I wouldn't call him overrated. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Think so, Jerry. Tip of the cap to Greenfield's own Mike McCarthy. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: CeeDee Lamb to the Cowboys.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Here goes Pittsburgh's traded pick. <br> <strong>George</strong>: But was it worth it for mikah <br> <strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: So Minkah Fitzpatrick was traded for ... <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Oh, yea... it was worth it. <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: Absolutely it was <br> <strong>Ed</strong>: Love Minkah... 1st rounders on someone who’s proved themselves. Take it all day!! <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Wonder if the Dolphins would take De'Andre Swift? Or one of the edge rushers I keep pushing....unsuccessfully. <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: If steelers kept 18. they would take who right now? <br> <strong>Nitro</strong>: Would anyone take any of the picks taken so far in exchange for Minkah? A resounding no from me on that hypothetical. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Hmmm, good question. They'd still need a safety so McKinney?</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: They'd actually probably have ended up drafting a lot higher. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: That's true.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: I don't think it's a great safety class, but McKinney is really good. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Probably in that 8-12 range, Paul. So maybe a tackle in that case.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: The defense jelled so well. Steelers are so much better going into this draft with Minka. <br> <strong>George</strong>: I don’t regret anything to tbh I think that’s the best decision Pittsburgh has ever made <br> <strong>George</strong>: What record do you think the Steelers will have i was thinking maybe 10-6 <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: It's early but 10-6 not a bad call. But who knows if there are no fans. A whole new dynamic to games.</p>
<p><strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: I think the Minkah trade was great, but I think the best decisions Pittsburgh made came in drafts from 1969 through 1974, particularly 1971 and 74. <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: minka trade was money! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'm so curious to see what the Patriots do in five picks. How can you not be?</p>
<p><strong>Ed</strong>: I hope Minkah’s in the chat!!! He’s going to go down in history with the Steelers! <br> <strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: I'm curious to see what the Dolphins do to rebuild that team, especially after getting Tua. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Dolphins take Austin Jackson. Another tackle.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: would somebody, for the love of GOD, please tell these commentators that Tua does NOT have an "N" in his last name...... <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That's actually the correction pronunciation, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: I think the Raiders take McKinney here. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: That's five tackles. Could still see Josh Jones, Ezra Cleveland and maybe Isaiah Wilson go in Round 1.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Raider taking the first running back? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, they drafted Josh Jacobs in Round 1 last year.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Pats take Love in Rd 1? They need WR but are terrible at drafting them <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That'd be a big swing by Bill Belichick on the next franchise QB. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Raiders go with Arnette, a CB from OSU.</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: David Arnette wow <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Between last year and this year, we can safely say the Raiders are doing their own thing with these draft evaluations.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Dang arnette is a reach. <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: He's an OK pick, but not at 19. <br> <strong>Nitro</strong>: The Raiders get their Artie Burns <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Ha ha</p>
<p><strong>LittleHomey412🌽</strong>: Yo, what up? How is my shaler dawg ? I think Minkah FITZ is better than anything miami can do with steeler pick. What do you think ??? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I agree, LittleHomey.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Is this where love goes? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Could be. They need to rebuild their entire roster though</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Just checked...and yes....you actually DO pronounce Tagovailoa with an "n" as in "Tango-Vi-Loa"<br> <br> now THAT is the most surprising thing in this draft. <br> <strong>George</strong>: Who do you think has made the best pick so far? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Really liked the Bucs getting Wirfs at 13. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Not many surprises until after the top 10. I actually like Wills to the Browns. Fills a need and I had him as my top tackle. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Good call too Brian.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Best pick: bungles with burrow or redskins with young <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: I keep pushing McKinney, but they can replace Fitzpatrick here with a guy who is a terrific athlete. <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: Wills to Cleveland. <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: best value: cowpies with ceedee lamb <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Jags take Chaisson.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: here comes a WR reach or a safety to replace Jenkins <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: First real edge rusher off the board. I see Simmons playing inside for AZ. But they'll move him around. <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Next to young, chaisson best pure pass rusher in the draft. Had to replace ngakoue <br> <strong>Dude</strong>: 3 receivers and no running backs / so far so good <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: How'd Doug Marrone get Sam Darnold in his house with him?</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: We seem to be on track for taking five receivers, is anyone surprised that a running back hasn't been taken yet? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Not me, Paul</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: RBs start late 1st, and then 2nd. You can get a pretty good back, value wise, in round 4. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Jalen Reagor's dad played for the Eagles... <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Good call Brian.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Don’t hex us bats <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Too late ha ha</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Eff the eagles <br> <strong>George</strong>: NOOO! Steelers were supposed to get him <br> <strong>Dude</strong>: He was always going in first round <br> <strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: I like a couple WRs more, but Reagor is a nice player. <br> <strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: I don't think he was going to last 25 more picks anyway. <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: I knew that 4.22/4.28 ran him into the first <br> <strong>SteelFalcon58</strong>: That was your boy Ray! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Jalen Reagor going to 21 doesn't affect the Steelers. I'm sure they'd be just as happy to take Justin Jefferson, so reall, it's just a WR going to the Eagles, which is no surprise at all. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Yes in Mock 2 I believe. I went Akers in my final one earlier this week.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: To me what we have seen so far increases the odds Steelers go RB with their first pick.... <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Maybe but there could be a run on RBs in second round. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Just saw a report that the Patriots TRADED their pick to the Chargers. So the Artists Formerly Known As San Diego will be up again after the Vikes. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Chargers take Swift to help Herbert???</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: I think the Vikings take a WR to replace Diggs <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: So it looks like New England is getting pick 37 and 71 for 23, a high second and high third in a deep draft. Belichick outsmarting folks again?</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: hmmmm Pats working on stocking up picks. Very Patriots-like <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Vikings have needed a receiver since treadwell busted. They can’t pass up jefferson <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Goodell is so awful at this. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Good call Mike. Jefferson to the Vikes.</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: i know I can’t stand him <br> <strong>Josh</strong>: to get reagor when the Cowboys got Lamb 5 picks earlier would drive eagles fans nuts <br> <strong>Moshe from Israel</strong>:</p>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Spider 2 Y Banana</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Micco</strong>: OK, 11 o'clock and it's time to go hibernate. Thanks everyone (especially Ray and Brian). <br> <strong>Ed</strong>: Nice one Brian!! <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: I think chargers might stay in state and pick taylor rb <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Would be pretty interesting if they replaced Melvin Gordon with another Wisconsin back.</p>
<p><strong>Ed</strong>: Thank you Jerry!! You rock. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Chargers take Murray.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Good linebacker. I still think queen is better <br> <strong>SWVA Stiller</strong>: Staying with the win now mode while we have BB7, what could a 2021 1st round pick get us in terms of draft capital? Kick the can down the road kind of like the salary cap <br> <strong>Ed</strong>: Always love to her these guys stories... he saved a life with CPR... awesome!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Interesting question, and I'm really not sure, but I also can't imagine the Steelers trading their first-round pick two years in a row after never doing it in the modern era.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Are there any interesting defensive backs that seem to be falling? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not really. Next CB should be Kristian Fulton from LSU. The safeties weren't consensus first-rounders anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Tomservo</strong>: Cant understand some people’s obsession with Steelers taking yet another smurfy wr like Reagor or Hamler who are best in the slot. Need tall and/ or fast guy to take top off <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Good point, Tomservo. Welcome, Tomservo.</p>
<p><strong>Ed</strong>: Brian - where is pizza coming from tomorrow? Local favorite or chain favorite? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Good chance it could be the Trader Joe's frozen pizza in my freezer currently, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: @tomservo reagor and hamler were definitely fast, just not tall. Maybe mims falls to us <br> <strong>Dude</strong>: McKinney and Queen going soon <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Queen maybe to Ravens</p>
<p><strong>Dude</strong>: Can’t see him last that long <br> <strong>Nitro</strong>: What's the plan for tomorrow's chat? All 3 of you guys back? And, daggum, Queen to the Ravens. <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: Any inside scoops for us chatters on articles you’re writing for tomorrow, or themes for unwritten tomorrow’s articles based on draft thus far? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ray and I will be here. As for the rest of tonight/tomorrow, Gerry Dulac will write on the Steelers' top options once Round 1 is over. I'm sure we'll have some other irons in the fire, as well. Tomorrow morning/afternoon will be like the eye of the storm a little bit. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Saints go with center Cesar Ruiz</p>
<p><strong>Dude</strong>: Like to see a mock for rounds 2 and 3 done now <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: For all 32 teams? That'd be a lot, Dude! <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Another trade. 49ers will pick here instead of Vikings.</p>
<p><strong>Tomservo</strong>: Still sticks in my craw that they took James Washington when DJ Chark was sitting there. <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: 9ers coming to get their WR <br> <strong>Mike</strong>:</p>
<p><br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: 49ers get Aiyuk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: @tomservo me too. We had just lost martavis and it was the perfect opportunity. Washington may still work out, but looking dumber by the day <br> <strong>Dude</strong>: Niners having a nice draft <br> <strong>Ed</strong>: What’s everyone’s thoughts on this virtual draft so far? I’ve loved getting a small glimpse of people’s homes, more of their family/friends, and taking a peek of their collections in the background. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Agreed, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>Tomservo</strong>: Fast as Reagor/Hamler may be they’ll never beat press man in the nfl <br> <strong>Tim</strong>: Swift to dolphins at 26? <br> <strong>Dude</strong>: Interesting to see how coaches and players dressed for the occasion <br> <strong>David</strong>: They should do the draft this way every year <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not a bad idea. The TV ratings will be through the roof regardless. It doesn't need to be an in-person event. Just my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Dude</strong>: That would be my pick Tim <br> <strong>David</strong>: Brian and Ray, do you think this is falling in a way that a top RB will be there at 49 or you think there will be an early run on RB tomorrow night? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Still a few more picks in first round but yeah so far it's looking like RBs will be available in the second round. But will there be a run early in the round? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Dolphins could probably use another WR. Tua with KJ Hamler would be pretty fun to watch.</p>
<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Based on what we now have seen, still a wr or is rb coming more into focus at 49? What say you ray and brian? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I went with Akers in my final mock draft so I'm sticking with RB <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: And I still think one of Tee Higgins, Chase Claypool, Michael Pittman, Laviska Shenault and Denzel Mims will be there at 49. But it's getting dicey. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Whoa, Green Bay trades up into this spot?!</p>
<p><strong>FittyCent &amp; BillyBatsko</strong>: Am I being blocked? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, you're a first-round edge-rusher around here.</p>
<p><strong>David</strong>: Yeah Ray you got me excited about Akers now to the point I'm going to be disappointed if that doesn't happen. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Packers take Jordan Love. There's your four QBs <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Holy cow. Did NOT see that one coming.</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Do you see the Steelers going LB or OL if the RBs and WRs they like are gone? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Hmmm, probably OL</p>
<p><strong>Dude</strong>: Shocker <br> <strong>Ed</strong>: WOW!!! <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: So much for Love to the Steelers. Ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Brett Favre just laughed hard <br> <strong>Dave</strong>: Still think it’s a tad early to be feeling good that a top RB will be there. Hope so though... <br> <strong>Ed</strong>: I get it happened with Favre but damn Aaron going to be pissed!!! Probably just like Favre but.... <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: Pack relying on wr depth in draft? <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Arod demands trade to the cheaters haha <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I do not understand this one for the Packers. Late-night late-first draft drama.</p>
<p><strong>Titan in Charlotte</strong>: Doesn't look like a RB will be drafted in first round. Waiting game for tomorrow <br> <strong>Dave</strong>: Dont jinx us😊 <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Teams looove getting that fifth-year option on first-round QBs. Maybe even smart teams. But I still think this is a strange pick by Green Bay.</p>
<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Who seems to be sliding, higgins, shenault jr that may fall into our lap in 22 picks? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Chase Claypool, Michael Pittman, all the RBs <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Shenault would be very fortunate for the Steelers. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Seahawks for Jordyn Brooks <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Jordyn Brooks over Patrick Queen. Huh.</p>
<p><strong>Dude</strong>: And now Queen to the ravens <br> <strong>Tim</strong>: Who are the ratbirds targeting? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Gotta be LB</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Queen is right there for them. Fml <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: What does shenault add to our wr room? Not tall, and not fast. Basically same measurables as juju <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Adds an offensive weapon. I don't like him more than Claypool, but I could see why the Steelers might want him. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Shenault gets YAC. Throw it to him short or throw it to him down the field. He's good in all phases.</p>
<p><strong>Buccs72</strong>: I'd rather have Michael Pittman of USC. Bigger, great hands and very tough. Just as fast as most of the receivers still available. <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: That question about shenault wasn’t supposed to be mean, I just don’t know what he adds. YAC won’t be as good in nfl. He’s only 4.58. I can understand if you’re steelers and you want big height 6’3+ or speed, but you already have 2 similar players in juju and washington <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I think he has bigger upside than Washington.</p>
<p><strong>Tomservo</strong>: Love Pittman. Just what they need. RB would be a waste. RBs we have would be fine if we had a WR to back the def off the los. <br> <strong>Dude</strong>: A running back adds more if we can get a 3 down guy <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Ravens take Queen</p>
<p><strong>Dude</strong>: That will turn out to be one of the best picks of this draft <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Went 3 for 3 here. Guess I should've put money on these predictions: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/16/afc-north-nfl-draft-2020-steelers-ravens-bengals-browns-predictions-joe-burrow-cincinnati/stories/202004160037" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/16/afc-north-nfl-...</a></p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: @ray no doubt on that. But picking shenault with similar skillset means steelers admit they busted with washington, which I don’t think is a fair statement yet <br> <strong>Tim</strong>: Assuming no rb taken in next 5 picks, might all be there at 49? Would swift be the pick? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Swift is tremendous but I actually think Jonathan Taylor would be the best fit for the Steelers.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Mims at WR tall and fast <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Titans on the clock. Are there any Shaler grads in this draft?</p>
<p><strong>Buccs72</strong>: Taylor's has great measurables but his fumbling issues are troublesome. If he is fumbling in college what happens when he takes NFL hits? <br> <strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Taylor may fall to us....Gimme Taylor sweet baby Jesus. <br> <strong>Dude</strong>: I would take Taylor, Akers, or Swift and be happy <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Lol what was that thing behind vrabel? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No idea. Wondering that myself, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: And yes. If mims is there, I don’t see how you could pass on that <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: I like taylor better too. Steelers have no explosion. All our skill players run 4.5 or slower. Our offenses have been best when we have that explosion. Willie parker. Mike Wallace. Santonio holmes. Martavis. Heck even nate washington <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Wilson goes to Titans. There goes another tackle. That's six. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Isaiah Wilson's stock skyrocketed after being featured in Ray Fittipaldo's first mock, per source.</p>
<p><strong>Titan in Charlotte</strong>: Maybe Green Bay takes Ken Karcher in round 2 <br> <strong>Jimmy</strong>: how do you see Ravens Pick Ray? Scary I think ,, looking hard for us to win division, and they still have plenty of high picks.. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: They needed an ILB. I like Queen. We'll see how he does as a rookie, but they definitely filled a need. LJ FOrt was one of their starters I think, so Queen will be a Day 1 starter.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: I definitely didnt like queen to baltimore. Ravens lacked speed at LB and were vulnerable there. This hurts <br> <strong>Buccs72</strong>: Taylor or Swift goes to either Miami or KC...maybe both go here at bottom of first round. <br> <strong>Plumbster</strong>: Take Clyde Edwards Helaire. Can catch can cut can run. A change of pace guy <br> <strong>Tim</strong>: Andy Reid won’t pick rb that high, at least i hope not <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They could use one, though.</p>
<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Dobbins to miami strong possibility, hope not, I’m a buckeye <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: I hope KC doesn’t take taylor. They have enough blazing fast guys. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Surprising a bit that Penn State's Yetur Gross-Matos is still out there. Same with AJ Epenesa from Iowa. This edge-rusher class is not getting a lot of love.</p>
<p><strong>TJ WhosYourMomma</strong>: Miami needs a safety <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Dolphins need everything, except a QB now. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Dolphins take a CB</p>
<p><strong>TJ WhosYourMomma</strong>: Reach <br> <strong>Matt Dillon</strong>: Can’t pass Festus’ boy <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Every time I hear the name Festus I just think Gunsmoke <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: LMAO, that guy behind the couch telling the woman to move. Demonstratively! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The player is totally shocked. Good for him.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: I pronounce the Stillers a Day 1 draft winner <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Vikings take Gladney, another CB</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Hard to see how things could have gone much better for Steelers <br> <strong>TJ WhosYourMomma</strong>: Perfect. This is turning out well <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Time for Mr. Irrelevant (of Round 1)</p>
<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Yeah,we got an all pro before any of these rookies hit the field. A+ grade for black and gold. <br> <strong>James</strong>: RB coming here <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: Swift or Taylor <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Swift, Taylor, Dobbins, CEH, all would look good in the Chiefs offense.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: The Steelers DB LB thing has me a bit confused. If Edmunds plays Barron's role this year, do Steelers take a safety? Any guesses who? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Quite possibly, yes. Any of the top names can probably play in the box/next to Minkah.</p>
<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Much like mel’s top available. How about 5 in order for us left on board. What say you ray and brian. Thanks, great time tonight <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Tailored to the Steelers? I'd say Denzel Mims, Chase Claypool, Michael Pittman, Laviska Shenault, Jonathan Taylor</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Ray &amp; Brian, which safeties do you like then, especially if Steelers move Edmunds to that hybrid role? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Delpit if you go round 2( I doubt it). Terrell Burgess is a guy you might be able to get in round 3. Lots of safeties in the middle rounds. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: For safeties, I'd rank them Delpit, Winfield, McKinney, Dugger, Chinn.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Thanks Ray Brian it was fun <br> <strong>TJ WhosYourMomma</strong>: My 5: mims, taylor, akers, pittman, claypool <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Chiefs take CEH. Wow. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Well, Brian before we sign off for the night. What are you thinking for tomorrow for the Steelers? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: An interesting final pick of the third round. He's gonna be a frightening piece in the Chiefs attack. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ray, I'm still thinking WR. That's what I'd do. But what will the Steelers do? A new RB wouldn't shock me at all. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Yep top four RBs still out there. Pittman, Shenault and other WRs like Claypool too.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Ray and B - well done. Good Times. <br> CEH it is. <br> <strong>Dude</strong>: Great work Brian and Ray <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Yep, thanks and good night all. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Thanks to everyone for joining in. Join us tomorrow for more draft talk! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Goodnight everyone. Thanks for chatting.</p>
