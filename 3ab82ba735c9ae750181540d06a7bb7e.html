<h1>Penguins’ Brian Dumoulin learns to cook lobster thermidor in NHL cooking show</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of the most prevalent quarantine cliches has been folks showing off their newfound culinary skills while stuck at home. Brian Dumoulin got in on that trend Tuesday with the added benefit of a professional chef teaching him how to cook.</p>
<p>The Penguins defenseman appeared in the latest episode of “Plates &amp; Skates,” a recently launched show where NHL players learn how to prepare dishes fit for a restaurant with the help of real chefs. Dumoulin had the privilege of learning how to make lobster thermidor from French chef and&nbsp;restaurateur Ludo Lefebvre.</p>

<p>The episode premiered earlier Tuesday on Canada’s SportsNet, but if you’d like to see Dumoulin’s kitchen prowess on a bigger screen, it will also air at 7 p.m. tonight on NHL Network.</p>
<p>Or, if you just want your daily dose of cuteness, check out this clip shared by the Penguins’ Twitter account of Dumoulin’s young song Brayden crashing the episode and not seeming particularly thrilled about his father’s lobster thermidor.</p>
<p>This is the third episode of “Plates &amp; Skates,” which the NHL launched about a month ago. The first episode happened to feature <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqKa_9ilZUU&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">old friend Nick Bonino</a> — the Predators center who won two Stanley Cups with the Penguins in 2016 and 2017 — making steak Diane and pomme frites with Lefebvre.</p>
<p>The second episode featured Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ8GlnvfIFk" target="_blank">preparing "Chicken Under a Brick"</a> with chef Marc Forgione. Whether Dumoulin was able to match his and Bonino’s cooking acumen is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
