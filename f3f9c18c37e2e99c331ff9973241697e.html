<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh police on Sunday afternoon served a search warrant for a suspect believed to have incited the violence that punctuated Saturday’s Downtown protest over the killing of George Floyd by law enforcement in Minnesota.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/blotterview/671" target="_blank">warrant was served</a> against Brian Jordan Bartels, 20 of Shaler for allegedly “breaking the windows out of a marked Pittsburgh Police vehicle Uptown, against the wishes of peaceful protesters who tried to stop him,” according to a release from police.</p>
<p>Mr. Bartels was not home when police served the warrant at his Shaler residence, but they did find evidence that links him to the violence that occurred Saturday. He is currently facing charges of “institutional vandalism, rioting and reckless endangerment of another person,” according to the report.</p>
<p>A warrant has been issued for Mr. Bartels’ arrest while the investigation continues.</p>
<p>Saturday’s protest developed into unrest after an otherwise peaceful event, including authorities using tear gas on demonstrators and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/30/Protest-Downtown-Pittsburgh-george-floyd-police/stories/202005300054" target="_blank">two police vehicles</a> being set on fire. Mayor Bill Peduto <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/05/30/Pittsburgh-George-Floyd-protests-Bill-Peduto/stories/202005300078" target="_blank">said that evening</a> the protest had been “hijacked by a group of individuals who put their own self-interest above the interest of the movement” and shared a video that is believed to be of Mr. Bartels.</p>
<p>In addition to releasing the identity of Mr. Bartels, Pittsburgh police on Sunday also provided the names of the 45 individuals arrested during Saturday’s protest. There was also a juvenile who was arrested, but that person’s name was withheld.</p>
<p>Here are the names of the adults arrested during the first day of Pittsburgh protests:</p>
<p>Two of the arrested individuals were identified as “John Does” for unclear reasons.</p>
