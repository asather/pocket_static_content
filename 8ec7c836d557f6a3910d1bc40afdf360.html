<p>“TOGETHER: THE HEALING POWER OF HUMAN CONNECTION IN A SOMETIMES LONELY WORLD”</p>
<p>By Vivek H. Murthy</p>
<p>Harper Wave ($29.99)</p>
<p>COVID-19 and its mandated social distance and isolation has highlighted the issue of loneliness. Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, who served as the 19th Surgeon General of the United States, approaches the challenge of loneliness through the lens of public health in&nbsp;“Together: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World.”&nbsp;He notes that humans are hardwired to seek human connection. We need it to thrive. Dr. Murthy defines loneliness as “the subjective feeling that you’re lacking the connections you need.” Without connections we are prone to both poor physical and mental health. A 2009 landmark study revealed that people with strong social ties are 50 percent less likely to die prematurely than people with weak social connections.</p>
<p>When a publication such as the Economist runs an article in 2018 about loneliness as a public health issue, it signifies that the problem is no longer just smoldering. Fanning these embers into a massive fire are several social trends. According to a 2018 U. S. Census Bureau report, 28 percent of American adults live by themselves with higher percentages for older adults. Add to this the American social norms of prizing individual achievement and competition which are widespread in many modern capitalist societies.</p>
<p>A 2014 Harvard survey of 10,000 American middle and high school students across a wide spectrum of races, cultures, and classes revealed that 60 percent of them ranked achievement as more important than caring for others.&nbsp;The students’ responses reflect the reality of many people striving for the trappings of success such as the latest consumer goods, large homes, and fancy vehicles, often at the cost of long work hours with little time for family and a social life. For working class people, a different phenomenon is in place as real wages have been stagnant for many years. Struggling to cover the bare basics means working two or more jobs with again, little time for family and socializing.</p>
<p>Dr. Murthy writes “According to a 2018 report by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 22 percent of all adults in the US say they often or always feel lonely or socially isolated.” Although often associated with older adults, loneliness has been shown to affect youth, with an uptick in middle school that continues through high school and college. This puts young people at risk for inadequate social skills and exacerbates mental health problems such as depression. The toxic combination of loneliness, stigma, anxiety, and poor social skills sets the stage for self-destructive behaviors such as drugs, tobacco, and alcohol, as well as compulsive eating, shopping, screen time, gambling, or sex to numb the emotional pain. And then there is the more socially acceptable but no less pathological behavior of work addiction.</p>
<p>Over time these damaging coping mechanisms make supportive, healthy connections even less obtainable. Loneliness is now coupled with despair, which can heighten the risk for deadly overdoses, alcohol associated liver failure, and suicides. Observers began referring to them as “death of despair.” With recent efforts directed at opioid addiction, opioid deaths appear to have declined or leveled off for now. Alarmingly, suicides and alcohol-related deaths continue to increase. The United States has seen a one-third increase in suicide death rates between 1997- 2017.</p>
<p>The first step after defining a problem is figuring out solutions. In&nbsp;“Together,” Dr. Murthy describes an array of programs across the lifespan that promote social connections. Some examples: Men’s Sheds and Happy to Chat Benches in the UK, and in the U.S. a non-profit called Beyond Differences that is dedicated to reducing social isolation in middle and high school; a Yale-developed program known as the RULER Approach to Social and Emotional Learning that can be used in kindergarten through eighth grade to promote emotional literacy; and the innovative Intergenerational Learning Center in Seattle that integrates a child care center into a complex that is home to 400 older adults.</p>
<p>Dr. Murthy addresses the paradox of the modern digital age, which has made staying in touch easier, but also has contributed to our connections being less meaningful and thus, has enabled some people to retreat into an online world that boosts loneliness. The solution is not to completely toss digital technology. Indeed, some research indicates that both extremes, being completely unconnected or totally engrossed every waking moment, are harmful to mental wellbeing. The key is controlling the use of screen time rather than allowing it to control us. Parents and other adults in children’s lives need to model thoughtful use of smartphones and laptops. This must begin when children are small, which is a critical time for face-to-face interactions.</p>
<p>Dr. Murthy asserts that our biggest challenge is finding ways to build a people-centered life and a people-centered world. Research shows that social activities such as volunteering, participating in choirs, book clubs, and advocacy organizations decrease activity in the brain’s stress and threat centers and raise our sense of well-being. Collective activism is good for our physical and mental health, and we might overcome some injustices and make the world a better place.</p>
