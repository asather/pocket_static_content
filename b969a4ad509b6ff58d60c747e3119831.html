<h1>51 new Americans provide important reminder of citizen rights and responsibilities</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For an hour Friday, Courtroom 8C in U.S. District Court, Downtown, became a sanctuary of reflection of what makes America strong, a welcomed if temporary replacement of the ennui of a politically divided country with an inspirational reminder of the glory, privileges and responsibilities of being a United States citizen in 2020.</p>
<p>During a monthly naturalization ceremony, the joy, pride and commitment on the faces of the 51 newest members of the American family was as unmistakable as it was a warm remembrance to those born here of what it means to be a U.S. citizen. Recognition of the country's strong melting-pot foundation was inevitable as America’s newest citizens hail from 31 different nations —&nbsp;from Afghanistan to Tajikistan, from Haiti to Fiji, from Jamaica to Malaysia, from Iran to Sudan. Each of them has a story that now further enriches the American mosaic.</p>
<p>Perhaps fittingly, the rotation for presiding at the legal ceremony fell to U.S. District Judge Cathy Bissoon, whose mother and stepfather are naturalized citizens from Trinidad. She said she normally tells their stories of following their dreams to the U.S., but she felt a need on this day to discuss both the power and promise of immigrants as well as the ugliness of some “statements made in the public square that may best be described as anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant or anti-some immigrants.” She said she has no idea where the immigrant debate in this country is leading.</p>
<p>“I will say that during this election year, there could once again be an increase in anti-immigrant sentiment among some,” Judge Bissoon said. “But, I can tell you a few things for certain: First, you should know that America is what it is in large part because of people like you. This country is unique among nations. It has achieved its greatness as a nation because it is a patchwork of people from other countries, with different backgrounds, cultures and religious beliefs. All immigrants have contributed in some way to the richness, strength, spirit and vitality of America.”</p>
<p>She reminded the new citizens of the three co-equal branches of government, a framework providing checks and balances “that has allowed our country to thrive and prosper even through the most challenging and the darkest of times. In particular, a fair and impartial judiciary exists, in part, to shield the oppressed from oppression and protect the populace from acts of tyranny —&nbsp;both big and small —&nbsp;that undermine the rights of our people,” she said, sitting beneath a large New Deal mural depicting steelworkers, coal miners and other laborers.</p>
<p>She continued: “Finally, just so there is no confusion amongst our new citizens, it is not un-American to peacefully disagree with your leaders or your government. It is not un-American to oppose and protest injustice wherever you see it. And it is not un-American to push for change that you believe will better our nation.These things are quintessentially American. In fact, it was those very acts that resulted in the creation of this country.”</p>
<p>Among those pledging to support and bolster his new country was Ian Jordan, 42, a native of Colombia. He formerly worked for Carnival Cruise Line during which time he met Pittsburgher David Marinelli in the Bahamas and fell in love. He moved here, the couple married and now live in Mount Washington. And he couldn’t be happier.</p>
<p>“It’s a dream. I am part of the community. I love Pittsburgh. I love Pennsylvania. I’m very proud of my journey and hard work to become an American citizen. I’m ready to bring all of the culture of my country to this land that has been built by the cultures of other lands for 200 years.”</p>
<p>Later, in an address to his fellow newly minted citizens —&nbsp;which he began with some “yinzerisms” —&nbsp;Mr. Jordan reminded everyone that “America is the great melting pot and we need to bring the best from our cultures to make the American culture even better.” And then he offered thanks for being “a yinzer and a Pennsylvanian. God bless America.”</p>
<p>Omar Abdulazeez, 43, of Penn Hills, formerly of Iraq, was so excited about the day that he arrived at the courthouse at 7:45 a.m. for the 10 a.m. ceremony. Working two jobs, as a mechanic and at a South Side hookah bar, his joy at this special day was palpable. “I am very excited because of the freedom in this country and everything it has done for my life and for my family.”</p>
<p>The ceremony was sponsored by Colcom Foundation whose vice president of philanthropy John F. Rohe evoked Pittsburgh icon Fred Rogers by wearing a sweater and addressed the America’s newest citizens with “Welcome to my neighborhood. Won’t you be my neighbor?”</p>
<p>He provided everyone, be they new or lifelong citizen, with a reminder of the great American experiment of self rule, that the first three words of the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution are “We the people.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that beautiful? Not, ‘I the king.’ Not ‘I the queen.’ Not ‘I the theocrat,’ ‘I the plutocrat,’ ‘I the aristocrat.’ We the people chart the course to making a more perfect union,” said Mr. Rohe, who once served in the Peace Corps.</p>
<p>The beauty of the diversity represented was magnified as Michael Palus, district court operations supervisor, read each name, one more mellifluous than another. The new citizens came forward one at a time and received a certificate of citizenship, an American flag and a welcome letter from President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>When Croatian native Katrina Barlow, 40, a research scientist awaiting her medical license, received those items, her daugher, Iliana, 4, already an American citizen by birth, ran to her mom and hugged her. That drew a collective “Awwww” from the crowd as her father Mark, a native Pittsburgher, snapped a photo.</p>
<p>Married couple Dinesh and Naina Koirale Khatiwoda of South Side, formerly of Bhutan and Nepal, respectively, said their new citizenship “gives us the chance to enjoy the freedom of the United States” including voting. Indeed, the League of Women’s Voters registered the new citizens to vote, a right a large majority likely will take advantage of later this year. That would be in stark contrast to the 100 million or so U.S. citizens —&nbsp;nearly half of those eligible to vote —&nbsp;who didn’t cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>With the ceremony over, the new Americans carried their certificates, flags and pride out of the courthouse and into a land that, as Woody Guthrie sang, “was made for you and me.”</p>
