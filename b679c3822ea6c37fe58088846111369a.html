<h1>WEATHER: Temps to soar into the 90s today, Wednesday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Summer hasn’t officially arrived, but today’s blistering heat is inching the Pittsburgh region closer to record highs.</p>
<p>Today’s high temperature is expected to reach 91 degrees although it will feel more like 93 due to an area of high pressure over Western Pennsylvania, said John Darnley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The record high for the day is 94 degrees, set in 1933.</p>
<p>“It's a pretty high area of pressure,” Darnley said, adding that the UV index will be “rather high, around 9. Normally it's around 7 on a nice, sunny day.”</p>
<p>He advised those working outdoors to stay hydrated and seek out the shade when they can.</p>
<p>The normal high for this time of year is 78 degrees, according to Darnley.</p>
<p>He noted that any remnants of Tropical Storm Cristobal “is not really driving moisture into our area... it’s really wrapped up good over Wisconsin and Michigan. But it doesn’t mean it won’t impact our weather.”</p>
<p>Darnley said any residual effects could produce steady winds of around 13 mph that will pick up through the evening.</p>
<p>Today’s heat will continue into Wednesday with highs again reaching into the lower 90s.</p>
<p>The day will start out partly cloudy before turning mostly cloudy by late afternoon — just as a cold front tries to push through the area.</p>
<p>“But the humidity is going to pop up... It will make it a little bit more interesting and there will be a downward swing in the pressure,” he said.</p>
<p>The temperature is forecast to swing back into the normal range on Thursday with a high of 76 and a slight possibility of rain, according to Darnley. The low will be in the 50s.</p>
