<h1>Stargazing: Vernal equilux?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>March is the month when the length of illuminated daytime hours exceeds the nightly period of darkness for northern observers, Most people associate this with the vernal or spring equinox. The word equinox translates to “equal-night,” and it is typically interpreted to mean the length of the day is precisely equivalent to the length of the night. This is a common, if slight, misconception. The equinox is defined as the date when the subsolar point — the point on Earth directly beneath the sun — passes over the equator. The actual date of equal night and day length occurs several days earlier than the vernal equinox on a day frequently referred to as the equilux.</p>
<p>This year the Pittsburgh equilux occurs on March 16. This is because the sun has non-zero angular size. On the equinox — March 19 — the centerpoint of the sun breaks the horizon and then sets again at a 12-hour interval, but sunset and sunrise are defined by the edge of the sun. The sun is roughly half a degree in angular size, meaning the upper, rising edge of the dawn sun breaks the horizon a few minutes before the center of the disc of the sun and conversely dips below the horizon at dusk a few minutes after the central point of the sun.</p>
