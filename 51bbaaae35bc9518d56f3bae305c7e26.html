<h1>In an ‘uncertain time,’ acclaimed East Liberty restaurant Spoon closes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Spoon, the innovative and acclaimed restaurant that helped usher in a new era of dining in East Liberty, will close for good per an announcement on the business’s social media platforms.</p>
<p>“It is with heavy hearts, that we announce the closure of Spoon. Over the last 10 years we have been proud to be a part of the ever-growing Pittsburgh dining scene. We have poured our hearts and souls into serving our customers and creating memories that, hopefully, last a lifetime.</p>
<p>“Due to the many unprecedented challenges our industry continues to experience and the expiration of our lease, we have decided it is best to close this chapter and look towards the future. During this uncertain time, we will spend time with our loved ones, taking a step back to better prepare us for our next adventure!</p>
<p>“We hope and pray for a better tomorrow, and we look forward to serving you all again soon ….”</p>
<p>The statement also thanked employees and customers.</p>
<p>After years of working in top kitchens in California, chef Brian Pekarcik, a native of Murrysville,&nbsp;returned to Pittsburgh and opened Spoon in 2010 with business partner Richard Stern. Spoon became the anchor of S+P Restaurant Group, which at one time included Downtown’s Grit &amp; Grace, Willow in Ohio Township, and multiple locations of BRGR, the regional gourmet hamburger restaurant concept.</p>
<p>Opened in the building at the corner of South Highland and Centre avenues, Spoon was an immediate hit and consistently drew high praise from critics and diners, and it was a perennial fixture on Pittsburgh Magazine’s best restaurants list.</p>
<p>The restaurant also was a fertile proving ground for some of the region's top culinary talent.</p>
<p>Dave Anoia, who had worked with Mr. Pekarcik in San Diego, was the sous and executive chef at Spoon for several years before opening his DiAnoia’s Eatery in the Strip District. Multiple James Beard nominee Jamilka Borges, who will open a restaurant in Etna later this year, was the executive chef there for two years. And, Sarah Thomas started there as a part-time bartender; she’s gone on to earn the rank of advanced sommelier in the Court of Master Sommeliers and has worked in that position at Le Bernardin in New York City, which is among the most prestigious restaurants in the country. She’s also written several children’s books that are food related.</p>
<p>Spoon is the second restaurant in a week on that block to announce its closure. Last week, Anthony Giaramita, pizzaiolo and owner of Pizza Taglio, announced that he would close his business at the end of service Saturday, citing business issues that were not related to COVID-19 closures.</p>
<p>However, the tumult of COVID-19 on the restaurant industry has hastened the demise of establishments nationwide, and Spoon is the latest high-profile closure in Pittsburgh. In June, Brugge on North, the ground-level tenant in the Alphabet City development at 40 W. North Ave. on the North Side closed, as did Union Standard, which opened to great fanfare in 2017 as an anchor tenant of the renovated Union Trust Building in Downtown Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Also, in East Liberty, Andrew Garbarino pulled the plug on his high-end Twisted Frenchman concept, the second-floor component to his namesake Garbarino’s Italian restaurant. The space has been rechristened as Grazing Rights, an upscale chop house, which will open next month.</p>
