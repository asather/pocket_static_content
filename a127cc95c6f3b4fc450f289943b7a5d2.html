<h1>Port Authority 'listening tour' on major decisions begins Wednesday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Over the past two years, Port Authority has started several major projects under new CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman: reviewing its fare structure, developing a new branding program, consolidating bus stops to improve service, preparing a 25-year plan to guide future service expansion.</p>
<p>Although the fare review and branding program were supposed to be done by now and the long-range plan further along, the transit agency has pumped the brakes on those projects until it can add what Ms. Kelleman called the missing link: public engagement before making any changes.</p>
<p>The agency will begin a series of nine public engagement meetings Wednesday that will allow the public to weigh in on those issues and more. The three-hour meetings will begin with sessions at 9 a.m., 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Downtown Pittsburgh, followed by a series of meetings throughout Allegheny County..</p>
<p>In September 2018, the authority hired local firms Campos and Red House Communication under a $327,195 contract to develop a new brand identity for the transit agency. The work was expected to take about a year, but the agency has slowed down the process until it builds a better track record and more credibility through these hearings.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelleman, who came here two years ago with extensive experience in transit planning, said the agency has made some progress at improving its public face through decisions such as dumping the proposed elimination of cash fares; not pursuing criminal enforcement for non-payment of fares; and ending proposals for massive transfers in Oakland and extensive neighborhood service cuts in the Monongahela Valley as part of the proposed Bus Rapid Transit system.</p>
<p>“It’s taken a while to build that trust,” Ms. Kelleman said Friday.&nbsp;“Some of these things I would have liked to move ahead with faster, but we’re not ready for that yet. Why would [people] have taken us seriously?”</p>
<p>So, it’s time for more public input before moving ahead on other decisions.</p>
<p>“Right now, we know what we need to meet the status quo,” Ms. Kelleman said. “But we’re not status quo. We’re a growing region.</p>
<p>“What we’re looking for is to hear comments on a listening tour. What does the community really want?”</p>
<p>For example, there has been a push to eliminate transfer fees and provide riders who can’t afford the upfront cost of a weekly or monthly pass the same benefits if they buy a certain amount of individual fares, a process called fare capping. But such changes would have a big financial impact, estimated at $4.5 million five years ago just to provide free transfers.</p>
<p>So riders will be asked to help the authority choose if it should pursue those changes and how to pay for them, whether through service reductions or other changes. Or is there another way to meet the needs of riders who have to transfer, maybe through day passes that allow unlimited rides for one charge or some other method?</p>
<p>The issue of bus stop consolidations has been a sticky one for Port Authority. It’s the one area where Ms. Kelleman says experience has shown her it’s better to recommend changes first, then get public input. But the first two rounds of proposed changes has generated some bad will from transit advocates and neighborhood organizations who want to be involved from the beginning rather than react to what they consider ill-informed recommendations.</p>
<p>On the 25-year plan, Ms. Kelleman said it is important for the public to weigh in on what it wants to see in transit’s future.</p>
<p>“Let’s hear what people want to make sure we’re planning in the right direction. Let’s dream big together.”&nbsp;</p>
