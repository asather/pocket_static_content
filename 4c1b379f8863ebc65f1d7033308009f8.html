<h1>Steelers second-year CB Justin Layne placed on COVID-19 list</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers cornerback Justin Layne was placed on the reserve COVID-19 list on Wednesday. He is the second Steelers player to go on the list. Cornerback Arrion Springs was placed on the list earlier this week.</p>
<p>Layne, who is entering his second season, was drafted in the third round of the 2019 draft. He is expected to be the top backup at corner this season after Artie Burns left the team as a free agent. Layne played 90 snaps last season, all on special teams.</p>
<p>Steelers veterans reported Tuesday and are undergoing COVID-19 testing and attending virtual meetings this week. There will be a strength and conditioning phase of workouts before the team begins to practice on Aug. 17.</p>
