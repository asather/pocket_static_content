<h1>Shot-in-Pittsburgh series 'I Am Not Okay With This' streams in February</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“I Am Not Okay With This,” a quirky coming-of-age Netflix series that was shot in the area last summer, has been given a Feb. 26 release date. All seven half-hour episodes will stream in what promises to be a major binge.</p>
<p>The series was shot in and around Brownsville, a soundstage facility in Warrendale and other Pittsburgh locales.</p>
<p>Sophia Lillis (“It,”&nbsp;“Sharp Objects”) stars as Sydney, an angry Pittsburgh-area teen dealing with the aftermath of her father’s death and her contentious relationship with her mother (Kathleen Rose Perkins). Her friendships with odd but endearing neighbor Stanley (Wyatt Oleff) and bestie Dina (Sofia Bryant) add to Syd’s confusion.&nbsp;And, she has emerging “Carrie”-like telekinesis powers.</p>
<p>Jonathan Entwistle co-created and directs the series. His previous Netflix offering,&nbsp;“The End of the F**cking World,” won a Peabody Award and, like&nbsp;“I Am Not Okay With This,” is based on a graphic novel by Charles Forsman.</p>
