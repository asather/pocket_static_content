<h1>Pittsburgh International Airport gets $36 million in federal aid to help offset COVID-19 losses</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With flights plummeting, the parking lot empty, and travelers down to a dribble, Christina Cassotis wondered out loud last week where Pittsburgh International Airport would get the money to keep operating.</p>
<p>At least part of the answer came Tuesday, when the Federal Aviation Administration awarded a $36 million grant to the Findlay airport to help maintain operations and to replace revenue that has evaporated because of the steep decline in travel precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh International was one of many commercial and general aviation airports to get relief Tuesday under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act airport grant program.</p>
<p>In all, about $10 billion in grants were awarded, with the largest going to the major airport hubs in the United States.</p>
<p>The grants can be used for airport operating expenses, including payroll and utilities, to cover capital costs, and and to make debt payments.</p>
<p>“This $10 billion in emergency resources will help fund the continued operations of our nation’s airports during this crisis and save workers’ jobs,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao said Tuesday in announcing the aid.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh International, like many other airports, is funded through revenue it receives from the airlines operating from the facilities as well as money generated from parking, concessions, rental cars, and passenger facility charges.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, all of those sources have all but dried up because of the novel coronavirus crisis. The number of daily travelers, normally about 13,000, is down to several hundred. About two thirds of about 45 concessions have closed temporarily, and the cars in the parking lots have become as scarce as planes in the sky.</p>
<p>Ms. Cassotis, CEO of the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which operates Pittsburgh International, could not be immediately reached for comment. The airport’s budget this year is $114.4 million.</p>
<p>To help cut costs, the airport has shut down its moving walkways, roped off part of one concourse in the airside building, where travelers get on and off planes, and may consolidate airlines on others.</p>
<p>It also has offered voluntary layoffs and early retirement programs to employees.</p>
<p>At the same time, the airport is receiving requests for rent relief from terminal businesses impacted by the lack of travel.</p>
<p>Other airports in the region to receive aid are Allegheny County in West Mifflin, $157,000; Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Latrobe, $2.4 million; Erie, $18.5 million; Harrisburg, $9.8 million; Beaver County, $69,000; Zelienople, $30,000; Bradford, $69,000; Dubois, $1.96 million; Franklin, $30,000; New Castle, $30,000; and Johnstown, $5.1 million.</p>
<p>Philadelphia International received $116.2 million.</p>
<p>To get the money, airports must execute grant agreements.</p>
<p>The amount provided to each airport was based on a formula that included 2018 boardings, debt service payments, and monetary reserves.</p>
