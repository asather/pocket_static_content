<h1>How a UFC pro and a former rival helped two Steelers rookies</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What do an elite MMA fighter and a forgotten Pittsburgh football villain have in common? Both offered their expertise and mentorship to the top two Steelers draft picks this offseason.</p>
<p>With no traditional team activities or minicamps to get rookies ready for the 2020 season, players everywhere had to get creative. For the Steelers, the COVID-19 pandemic meant no time in-person with head coach Mike Tomlin or quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>But in place of that, second-round pick Chase Claypool and third-rounder Alex Highsmith found some interesting&nbsp;sports figures to help them out over the last few months. Claypool, a 6-foot-4 wide receiver, spent the pre-draft and post-draft process working with T.J. Houshmandzadeh. Yes, the same Houshmandzadeh who has more receptions, receiving yards and touchdown catches than all but a few players against the Steelers this century and once wiped his cleats with a Terrible Towel while playing for the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
<p>“We worked on a lot of things, but the two main things were top of the route, and then releases that we did,” Claypool said of what he learned from the former third-down master with the memorable name. “We did a lot of technique stuff within those two categories. The work with him definitely paid off.”</p>
<p>Houshmandzadeh, who retired after the 2011 season, now trains high school and college receivers in California. This year, that group included Tee Higgins and Michael Pittman Jr., the first two picks of the second round, as well as Claypool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Highsmith did his fair share of traditional football training too, but also sought out a favorite son of his hometown, Wilmington, N.C. Derek Brunson is the eighth-ranked middleweight on the UFC circuit, and his big fight Saturday night against Edmen Shahbazyan is the main event in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Brunson has known Alex’s dad, Sam, for years. So when Sam Highsmith reached out to Brunson, who also runs a martial arts-based fitness center in Wilmington, the 36-year-old southpaw was happy to help a young outside linebacker.</p>
<p>“I knew about him in high school when he was actually a little chubby kid his freshman year,” Brunson said. “But he was always a hard worker, went to Charlotte and blossomed there. He had a crazy fast rise, all just predicated on hard work and dedication.”</p>
<p>It’s not unusual for NFL or even NBA players to cross-train at boxing and MMA gyms, according to Brunson. And for an edge-rusher, especially, “his hands have to be fast and explosive.”</p>
<p>“Pass-rushers with boxing or kickboxing go hand-in-hand,” Brunson said. “You’ve got to have fast, sharp hands and be straight down the middle, because linemen are coming off and you have to be able to pop their hands down. It can translate into him getting around 300-pound linemen and stuff like that.”</p>
<p>While Highsmith was working on his punch with Brunson, who has fond memories of winning a 2016 fight in Pittsburgh and meeting former Steelers Antonio Brown and Arthur Moats, Claypool was honing his craft with a one-time thorn in the side of his new team.</p>
<p>But for as much as Houshmandzadeh had to hate the Steelers when he was in Cincinnati, he also knows the organization as well as just about any opponent. And he told Claypool it’s somewhere he can excel.</p>
<p>“He was really excited for me, where I went, because he thought it was a great fit for me,” Claypool said. “He thought I’d do really well in this system.”</p>
<p>Or, as the always colorful and never-shy-to-speak-his-mind Houshmandzadeh put it when Claypool revealed his Madden rating, a modest 70, on Instagram: “Once you get on that field and start killing they [behind], [stuff] gon’ change real fast.”</p>
