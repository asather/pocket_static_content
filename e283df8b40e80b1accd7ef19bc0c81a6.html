<h1>Ben Roethlisberger hopes for clearance to throw light objects later this month</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ben Roethlisberger will visit his doctors in California Feb. 21 and hopes to get clearance to begin throwing tennis balls and other light objects.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger, who left at halftime of the Steelers’ second game with a painful elbow injury that came from wear and tear from 16 seasons in the NFL, had surgery Sept. 23 performed by Dr. Neal ElAttrache of the Cedars-Sinai Kerlan Job Institute in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger plans to stay in California for a period of time to meet with throwing coaches. He&nbsp;remains hopeful he will be ready for the Steelers’ OTAs in May, mini-camp in June and training camp in July.</p>
<p>“Absolutely, I plan on playing again,” Roethlisberger told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in October “That’s my absolute goal. That’s why we did the surgery. The reason we did it and did it so soon is because I want to come back. I don’t have any doubts in my head about that. If you have doubts, then you’ve already lost. It’s going to be a long road, but I’m excited for the opportunity to show I can do it.</p>
<p>“I want to go out on my own terms. No one wants to leave on an injury they can’t control.”</p>
