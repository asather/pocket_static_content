<h1>With Howlers closing, the 'band mom' reflects on her days at the club</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With Howlers announcing over the weekend that it had pushed up its closing date from August to right now, it has hastened the retirement of the “band mom” who kept the scene there running.</p>
<p>Mary Jo Coll, who started as a bartender at the Bloomfield venue in 2004, took over the booking after a few years and turned Howlers into the perfect dive for the indie-rock and Americana music scene. She was all essential in the development of RANT (Rock All Night Tour) that would become the model for the Deutschtown Music Festival and the Millvale Music Festival.</p>
<p>When owner Susan Coe announced in February that she was closing Howlers and relocating to East Liberty in the fall, Coll decided she would use the occasion to retire.</p>
<p>There were supposed to be some big closing parties as part of Bloomfield’s Little Italy Days in August, but due to the pandemic, Coe decided to close Howlers earlier than scheduled.</p>

<p>“To all of you that have come to a show, played a show or hung out and had some laughs, we will miss you and hope to see your faces at our new location.”</p>
<p>On Monday morning, we checked in with Coll about the sudden turn of events and what’s next for her.</p>
<p><strong>First of all, how have you been coping and spending time during this pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>Being stuck in the house and having no company has been hard. I love to entertain so having days go by with nobody around is a little maddening. I have been trying to get some yard work done on the nice days, cooking and baking are my go-to relaxation activities, but with nobody to feed, the freezer is starting to fill up and my housemates are gonna gain some weight. When this is over, I am gonna throw one hell of a feast for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>How and when did you first enter the music scene?</strong></p>
<p>[laughs] I have no clue. I mean, I've always been a live music junkie. Even during the disco era when my friends were hanging out at Zelda’s, Upstairs at Mr. C's, Club 2000, I was the one sneaking off to whatever dive had live bands. The Decade, etc. Over the years, I worked at bars, clubs, and catering, then finished my degree and started working as a paralegal, but still did some catering. Around 2004 I got laid off from the law firm I was working for, answered an ad in the paper for a part-time bartender job at Howlers. I only really planned on picking up a bar shift a couple nights a week till I found another position in an different area of law than what I had been doing.</p>
<p>The booking process at Howler’s at the time was hilarious. The paralegal in me took over and I started making more sense of it, and I was having so much fun with the young punk bands, and young kids asking to play. Anyway, things came to things. I found myself a niche as they say, came out from behind the bar and worked behind the scene and never did go back to the law, and here we are 15 to 16 years later. I've seen some of these kids grow up in front of me, their music mature, and I couldn't be prouder like a damn band mom should.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve always been a strong advocate for the musicians. How did you balance that with the business side?</strong></p>
<p>Well. I'm a great believer that if one thing works, it all falls into line down the line. These “kids,” the young bands and musicians need to get out there, they need someone to believe in them. If I can help make it easier on them, they are less stressed, they play better sets, they get more folks to come out to see them -- more people means they spend money on drinks, etc., the bar makes money. Having a solid family of staff that are also having a good time at work, means they make tips. It all just finds its way together and everyone has a good time and goes home with a smile. I advocate for the music, the venue and the family we all became that worked at Howlers.</p>
<p><strong>What were some of the highlights for you over the years at Howlers?</strong></p>
<p>That's a hard one. Sooo many great nights, great bands. The Tribute things we did that were band driven, i.e., I didn't ask them to do it, they asked me if they could. The Who show, the Motown show, The Neil Young show. The PBR Punk Rock nights were hilarious fun and the first thing I did there that started all this mess. The Rockabilly Riots brought in some amazing acts, including getting Wanda Jackson to play Howlers.</p>
<p>I think the bands all coming together for my 60th birthday a couple years ago and indulging me in a “Nuggets” show and managing to raise over $800 for Planned Parenthood was one of those amazing nights I'll hang on to. This could go on. I'm currently trying to round up photos of all the moments over the years and find myself laughing and crying over some memories being brought back.</p>
<p><strong>What about low points?</strong></p>
<p>There were failures, things I thought would work that didn't. Some interpersonal things between me and ownership that would explode from time to time. I tend to be a stubborn old broad and say things that piss people off so I have folks out there still mad at me for mistakes that happened years ago. I don't mean to, it just happens. I don't know, I'm trying not to dwell on the s--t that went wrong and hang on to the things that went right. Life is too short for hanging on to anger. I have always tried to accept that people have a right to feel the way they feel. If I did something wrong, I apologized. If they want to continue to be angry, I can't really change that can I?</p>
<p><strong>What would you say you accomplished in terms of building the scene?</strong></p>
<p>Lord, I have no clue. I guess you'd have to ask them. I would hope that I at least accomplished helping out some young band get their stage feet wet so to speak. Encouraged confidence in some that I saw great talent in and gave them the mom kick in the butts they needed to push further. I am grateful they allowed me to help wherever I could. I mean I have no powerbase, or money to throw at them, but if I could at least help to get the word out to the world around us that they should be seen and heard, I guess that's a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like to see other organizations take the ball and run with the RANT idea?</strong></p>
<p>Eh, they say imitation is the best flattery, right? It would have been nice to get the kind of backing and financing others got. But honestly, RANT started with a conversation between Zombo and myself, like, “Hey, I'd like to do this, do you want to help?” Meetings and spitballing for a couple months and we went for it. He put up most of the money the first couple years. We got a little sponsorship from some beers. But at the time, Lawrenceville was so ever-changing and after a few years, didn't really need a RANT or large fest to draw attention to the neighborhood. And when it started I had said that if after five years we were not getting enough in sponsorships to pay all the acts, I would withdraw. Zombo had other commitments; it was just not sustainable to continue. I love that other areas of the city thought enough of what we started to keep it going and make it bigger, so it’s all good.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think happens next for the Howlers bands?</strong></p>
<p>The ones that have found some modicum of local success will move on to the bigger venues like they always have. I mean that was always the goal right? I feel for the young ones and new bands that I always tried to give a chance. And hope there is someone out there willing to step up. I don't know how things will work out, but I suspect they are an industrious lot and they'll find other digs. With the current situation and the stoppage of gatherings amid this Covid-19 thing, I have deep concerns for the live music industry in general and worry it’s going to take a very long time to come back and these musicians are gonna be in a tough spot. So, Howlers aside, everyone is hurting right now. The future is very uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like for you to walk away and what do you plan to do?</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard, but it’s time I guess. I thought I had the summer to transition into this. I had a bunch of "finale" shows booked with bands that have played over the years. and the whole final weekend block party for Little Italy Days. Just not meant to be. I kind of feel like the rug got pulled out from under me before I was really ready. I find myself getting up every morning, pouring coffee, opening my emails to on-date requests and realizing, wait, I don't do this anymore. But, the last couple years I've had less and less of a physical presence at Howlers. I moved down the hill to Lawrenceville, my health has been an issue. It’s harder for me to travel up and down the hill. And it’s a changing scene that needs someone other than this old broad to step in right?</p>
<p>I'll continue to do a little cooking at Hambone's if they ever get reopened after the quarantine. Book some smaller stuff here and there. As to the future plans, I haven't decided. I thought maybe I'd offer cooking lessons at my house now that young folk are getting more interested in learning that skill than eating out every night. Who knows. In my typical fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants style, just gonna have to see where the wind takes me.</p>
