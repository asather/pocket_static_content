<h1>Pirates spring training: Pitchers allow four home runs, 19 hits in loss</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>SARASOTA, Fla. — The Pirates’ pitching problems continued Thursday in a 13-0 loss to the Orioles at Ed Smith Stadium in Sarasota, Fla., dropping them to 0-6-1 this spring.</p>
<p>Keone Kela and Geoff Hartlieb combined to give up eight of the runs, while Chris Stratton and Cody Ponce allowed two apiece. As a team, the Pirates surrendered 19 hits. Ten of those went for extra bases. Four landed over the fence.</p>
<p>The Pirates have now allowed an MLB-high 11 home runs this spring, while their run differential (minus-26) is also the worst in the majors.</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Hector Noesi started and actually fared well, pitching two scoreless innings while allowing one hit and striking out two. Signed to a minor league deal this offseason, Noesi said he’s been working on pitching up in the zone with his fastball.</p>
<p>“Everybody is pitching up, so I have to,” Noesi said. “I’m old school. Before it was everything down. Now, everybody is pitching up. I have to make an adjustment to keep playing baseball.”</p>
<p>Pirates manager Derek Shelton likes Noesi’s confidence with his breaking ball; after missing a couple early, Noesi came back with the pitch, confident it would work.</p>
<p>Noesi fared well in Triple-A last year, going 11-4 with a 3.82 ERA in 21 starts, but his numbers didn’t translate to the major leagues, where he went 0-3 with an 8.46 ERA with the Marlins. Fatigue was the biggest reason, Noesi said.</p>
<p>There’s almost no chance for Noesi to make the big club out of camp, but he’s a depth option who could make his way to Pittsburgh if he pitches well with Class AAA Indianapolis and somebody gets hurt.</p>
<p>“First time getting to see him in a starting role, I thought he did a nice job,” Shelton said.</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>Colin Moran was the only Pirates player with multiple hits, as he went 2-for-3 with a double. Jacob Stallings also doubled.</p>
<p>The hits were Moran’s first of the spring, although Shelton said he likes what he’s seen from the guy who, barring something crazy, will likely start at third base on opening day.</p>
<p>“Really aggressive swings,” Shelton said. “You see the breaking ball, the first that he hit off the wall in right center. Even his last at-bat, I thought he was really aggressive. … I like the fact that he’s putting himself in a position to hit.”</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>The most interesting part of this one might’ve come after the game, when Shelton said the Pirates will experiment with using a four-man outfield in 2020.</p>
<p>No, that doesn’t mean they’ll have four full-time outfielders. It’s more likely shifting Adam Frazier to an outfield spot when they face someone who doesn’t hit many ground balls but has power.</p>
<p>“You’re just covering more ground,” Shelton said. “We’re not going to do it just to do it. It’s not going to be something that we’re doing as a sideshow. We’re going to do it when there’s a purpose to it and we feel it’s our best matchup.”</p>
