<h1>Obituary: Carlton Haselrig, six-time NCAA wrestling champion and Pro Bowl lineman with Steelers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Carlton Haselrig, the only six-time wrestling champion in NCAA history who went on to become a Pro Bowl guard with the Steelers and a mixed martial arts champion, died Wednesday morning at the age of 54.</p>
<p>Haselrig collapsed in his Johnstown home at 8:15 a.m. and was pronounced dead a little more than an hour later, according to Cambria County coroner Jeffrey Lees.&nbsp;Haselrig’s death appeared to be from natural causes, Lees said. An autopsy was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Johnstown native experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows during his remarkable journey from one-man high school wrestling team to standout NFL lineman, all without ever playing a down of college football.</p>
<p>Haselrig’s athletic career began at Greater Johnstown High School, where he compiled a 10-0 record as a senior in 1984 despite the school not having a wrestling team. Haselrig won district, regional and PIAA championships as a heavyweight before going on to make history at Pitt-Johnstown wrestling for legendary coach Pat Pecora.</p>
<p>“Carlton and I had a very, very special relationship,” said Pecora, who recently became the NCAA’s all-time wins leader. “I was blessed to have him in my life. He was family to me and my family. He babysat my first daughter, my oldest child. He came to our family reunions. My mom and dad loved him. My brothers and sisters did, too.</p>
<p>“We just had a special relationship, and it grew.”</p>
<p>During a remarkable three-year stretch in the late 1980s, Haselrig became the first and last wrestler to win six NCAA individual championships, claiming both the NCAA Division I and Division II titles for three consecutive years. That led to the creation of the “Haselrig Rule,” which prevents wrestlers from Division II or III schools from competing in the Division I tournament.</p>
<p>“He had no concept of someone being able to be better than him at something,” Pecora said. “I remember the first time we went to the Division I tournament, newspapers were asking him, ‘What do you feel like when you have to wrestle somebody from Iowa or Oklahoma?’ He looked at them like their head was on fire.”</p>
<p>Despite not having played football since high school, the Steelers were infatuated with Haselrig’s athletic talent and took him in the 12th round of the 1989 NFL draft. By his third year in the league, he cracked the team’s starting lineup on the offensive line. In 1992, he made the Pro Bowl and helped the Steelers win a division title.</p>
<p>Haselrig, however, battled drug and alcohol addiction throughout his life. He signed with the New York Jets before the 1995 season but went AWOL that fall and received his second suspension for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy.&nbsp;He never played another snap in the NFL, but his athletic exploits and journey were far from over.</p>
<p>Haselrig returned to football in 2001 as an assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Colts of the North American Football League. After a couple of years, he decided to pursue a new career as an MMA fighter.</p>
<p>Having made the switch to MMA well past his athletic prime, Haselrig never made it to the Ultimate Fighting Championship like he initially hoped. But he finished his professional MMA career with a 3-2 record, capturing a pair of heavyweight titles from smaller promotions in his professional debut at age 42.</p>
<p>Pecora said Haselrig’s health deteriorated over his last couple of years, with a liver condition causing him to lose an abnormal amount of weight. He said Haselrig was down to “skin and bones” the last time he saw him, but he still shook his hand with a vice grip and could have broken it if he wanted to.</p>
<p>“I’ve got some great memories with Carlton. Fantastic,” Pecora said. “We conquered the world that was in front of us, together.</p>
<p>“He’s had his demons, and that’s the kind of life Carlton had. From the top of the mountain, to the valley. He lived a life full. But I feel good in the long scheme of things … I think he made peace with himself and was in a good spot and a good place in his life.”</p>
