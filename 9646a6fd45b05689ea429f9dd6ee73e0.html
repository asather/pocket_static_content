<h1>Pittsburgh could break all-time high temperature Saturday, but high winds are expected late in the day</h1>

<p>You’re more likely to see neighbors in short sleeves and shorts Saturday than mufflers and mukluks.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service is forecasting a record high of 70 degrees Saturday, which would break the all-time record of 68 for Jan. 11. It would mark the first time the temperature reached 70 or higher in January since 2005, said Jenna Lake, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Moon.</p>
<p>The skies were partly cloudy with pale sunshine at 11 a.m. and a temperature of 65 degrees.</p>
<p>“Today is a bit unusual for January,” said Ms. Lake, noting the region has had a weather pattern for several weeks with low pressure to the west allowing warm air to rise from the Gulf of Mexico and keep temperatures above normal. Saturday’s expected high is exactly double the average daytime temperature of 35 degrees for this time of year.</p>
<p>The biggest potential weather problem is wind. The weather service has issued a wind advisory for&nbsp;Western Pennsylvania from 11 p.m. Saturday to 1 p.m. Sunday, with sustained winds of 10 miles an hour but there could be gusts as high as 50 miles a hour, Ms. Lake said.</p>
<p>The extended forecast calls for daytime highs from 52 to 56 degrees through Wednesday, Ms. Lake said. There’s a decent chance of rain showers Tuesday through Thursday.</p>
<p>Temperatures aren’t expected to return to normal before next weekend and there’s little chance for snow any time soon. Ms. Lake may be among the few who doesn’t want that trend to continue because she’s from Duluth, Minn., where Saturday would qualify as a mid-summer day.</p>
