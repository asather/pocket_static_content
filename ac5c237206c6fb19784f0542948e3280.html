<h1>West Mifflin school board fields criticism for rocky remote start </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Parents and teachers in the West Mifflin Area School District expressed concerns over the fully remote start to the school year at a recent school board meeting.</p>
<p>The district began the school year online and will continue for the first nine weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>At a Sept. 24 school board meeting held via Zoom, several people emailed comments to the district, which were read aloud.</p>
<p>High school teacher Rebecca Cibulka said she monitors the social media accounts for several school organizations and said, “I’ve seen many comments, mostly negative, about the education students are receiving virtually, the technology issues that have occurred and the crowd sizes at sporting events.”</p>
<p>Just after the start of the school year, the district recalled student devices for “urgent security updates.” Students then had to schedule times to pick up their devices.</p>
<p>The district also came under fire for allowing nearly 600 spectators to attend the Sept. 11 high school football game.</p>
<p>“What everyone needs to be aware of is, in all these situations, it is that not one of them is the fault of the teachers. In fact the teachers in this district are working harder than ever to give the students as much of an education as possible despite the circumstances,” Ms. Cibulka said.</p>
<p>“The teachers are the ones making this work,” she added. “From my own personal experience, I can tell you I’ve worked eight to 12 hours each day, plus two to six hours over each weekend.”</p>
<p>Nicole Lowers, who teaches in another area school district and has a sixth grader at West Mifflin Area Middle School, said the district where she works has students in school five days a week as well as giving the option to parents to keep their children home to do school online.</p>
<p>“The school district where I teach implemented social distancing, sanitation and mask wearing and health measures to make sure students receive the free, appropriate education that they deserve,” she said. “Not all students can learn through sitting in front of a computer where the majority of the conferences on the adapted schedule are taken up by connectivity issues and taking attendance.”</p>
<p>“These kids need to be back in person,” said parent Mindy Cunningham. She said her child’s fifth grade teachers “are not computer smart” and “seem like they are having so much trouble navigating” the remote learning platforms.</p>
<p>“We understand the frustration level of parents,” said district Superintendent Jeffrey Soles. He also said plans are in place to bring kids back to school in-person and that meetings are already underway.</p>
<p>“We hear the parents,” he said.</p>
