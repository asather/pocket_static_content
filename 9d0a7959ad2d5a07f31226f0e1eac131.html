<h1>Improving power, defensive versatility have Phillip Evans on the cusp of Pirates' roster</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The smoke around Phillip Evans and the likelihood of his placement on the Pirates’ Opening Day roster has been building for a while now.</p>
<p>Even before summer camp began, manager Derek Shelton named Evans as a possible designated hitter option for the Pirates. In the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/20/Bullpen-problems-Pirates-loss-Indians-Trevor-Williams-Richard-Rodriguez-Michael-Feliz/stories/202007200125" target="_blank">Pirates’ second exhibition game</a> against the Cleveland Indians on Monday night, Evans was one of just two Pirates, along with Colin Moran, to go play all nine innings.</p>
<p>And Evans took advantage of that opportunity. In his first at-bat, he drove a ball 410 feet to left center field for a two-run home run. In the eighth inning, he ripped a double to left, too, finishing his night 2-for-5 from the plate.</p>
<p>“I've been waiting to get a barrel like that this whole spring 2.0, and it came in Cleveland, a nice place to hit,” Evans said. “A lot of the boys tacked on at the end there. It was good to see. We have a lot of good hitters in this lineup."</p>
<p>The power Evans displayed Monday is a relatively recent development for him in his career. He has still yet to hit a home run in the major leagues, but before 2017, he hadn’t had much minor league power either. Slowly, that improved, until last season he hit&nbsp;17 homers in 130 games while playing at Class-AAA in the Chicago Cubs’ organization.</p>
<p>In spring training, he credited&nbsp;Kevin Long, a former New York Mets and current Washington Nationals hitting coach, with helping his approach to hitting, which spurred his power surge.</p>
<p>If nothing else, that at least helped increase Evans’ value on the open market last offseason. The Pirates showed interest, and Evans was immediately drawn to them. That was, in large part, because of the relationships he already had with multiple Pirates players. A San Diego native, he was previously familiar with Pirates shortstop Kevin Newman and pitchers Steven Brault, Trevor Williams and Joe Musgrove.</p>
<p>In fact, during the delay to the 2020 season amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Evans lived with Musgrove in San Diego. Evans said Tuesday that he thinks Musgrove may have done lobbying on his behalf to get him signed to the Pirates.</p>
<p>“They really wanted me here, and I really wanted to be here,” Evans said. “I think it was a great fit, seeing some of those familiar faces again and just having fun and wanting to push each other and competing. Musgrove, training with him in the offseason, really showed me that work ethic that he’s got, and I wanted to be a part of it and see where the team could go.”</p>
<p>The other large part of Evans’ value is his ability to play multiple positions. He came up through the minor leagues primarily as a shortstop, and said he feels most comfortable playing somewhere on the infield. In the Pirates’ first two intrasquad games, he has primarily played third base while also moving out to right field for a spell on Monday night.</p>
<p>“Because of the number of positions he plays, he fits in a lot of places, and as you’ve seen, he’s played really well, not only in 2.0 but 1.0, at third base,” Shelton said Monday night. “We’ve moved him into the outfield a little bit more during 2.0. He’s done a nice job out there. He made a nice catch the other night. He made a nice catch tonight.</p>
<p>“His versatility plays, and the fact that he continues to put good swings on the baseball — what did he have, two or three hits tonight — with some heavy velocity hitting the ball like he did off [Indians pitcher Mike] Clevinger, I think his versatility allows us to do a lot of different things with him.”</p>
<p>Evans, for his part, is fine with whatever role he’s asked to fill. His main focus has been steadily improving his game from spring training to summer camp and continuing to build off the good impression he feels he made from the start.</p>
<p>That, in his mind, will be good enough to slide into the Opening Day roster come this Friday.</p>
<p>“I think I had a good shot on spring 1.0, but swinging it well and bouncing around the infield and some outfield,” Evans said. “So just took whatever I was doing there and put it into the ol’ 2.0 here and having fun.”</p>
<p><strong>Erlin, Murphy added to 40-man roster</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates selected the contracts of left-handed reliever Robbie Erlin and catcher John Ryan Murphy on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Both signed with the Pirates this offseason on minor league deals.</p>
<p>Murphy’s selection comes as no surprise, as he will be the Pirates’ backup catcher after Luke Maile fractured his finger a few days ago.</p>
<p>Erlin's inclusion doesn't necessarily qualify as a surprise, but it is notable. The left-hander got his first exhibition-game action on Monday night against the Cleveland Indians, pitching one inning and allowing two hits, including a solo home run and a double from the first two batters he faced. Erlin rebounded and struck out two of the next three hitters to end the inning.</p>
<p>"Right at the end of 1.0, we started to see the effects of the plan that we were putting into place, the adjustments that we were doing," Shelton said. "At the beginning of 2.0, there was a little bit [of a] step back, and I think we had to have some conversations about what we wanted him to do and how we wanted him to do it. In the last few outings, he’s really executed that. Really happy with that and happy he’s going to part of the club."</p>
