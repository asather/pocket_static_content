<h1>Sidney Crosby, Phil Kessel reunite for golf outing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Phil Kessel hasn’t been a Penguin for almost a year, but he still occasionally hangs out with his ex-teammates and posts about it on social media.</p>
<p>Kessel — who won two Stanley Cups with the Penguins before being traded to the Arizona Coyotes last June — on Saturday posted a photo to his Instagram Stories of himself and Sidney Crosby hitting the links together.</p>
<p>It's unclear when this photo was taken or, for that matter, if the golf course they were playing on was in Pittsburgh, Arizona or somewhere else.</p>
<p>While Kessel’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/07/01/RIP-to-the-Malkin-Kessel-friendship/stories/201907010127" target="_blank">unique friendship</a> with Evgeni Malkin has been well-documented, his relationship with Crosby wasn’t the subject of nearly as much intrigue during his time in Pittsburgh. The two are clearly still tight enough for the occasional golf outing while they and the rest of the NHL <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/22/Penguins-vote-yes-to-24-team-playoff-format/stories/202005220143" target="_blank">await word</a> on when and how the season will (hopefully) resume.</p>
<p>The Penguins and Coyotes played twice during the 2019-20 season, with the Penguins coming out on top 2-0 at PPG Paints Arena on Dec. 6, 2019, and emerging victorious again on Jan. 12, 2020, with a 4-3 shootout win at Gila River Arena.</p>
<p>Though one can argue about how well the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/12/05/pittsburgh-penguins-phil-kessel-trade-alex-galchenyuk-arizona-coyotes/stories/201912050167" target="_blank">Kessel trade worked out</a> for both sides, two things are undeniable: just how <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2020/04/21/pittsburgh-penguins-phil-kessel-jason-zucker-patrick-marleau/stories/202004210029" target="_blank">fascinating of a character</a> Kessel continues to be, and his admiration for the city of Pittsburgh and Penguins fans.</p>
<p>“I love this city,” Kessel <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/12/06/Phil-Kessel-on-Pittsburgh-I-love-this-city-Arizona-Coyotes-Penguins/stories/201912060163" target="_blank">told the Post-Gazette</a> on Dec. 6. “I love [the fans]. They treated me great.”</p>
