<h1>PIAA boys basketball roundup: Mars misses big man Carmody in loss </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There was little doubt that not having all-state forward Michael Carmody was going to have an impact on Mars’ fate as it headed into its PIAA Class 5A opener against Elizabethtown.</p>
<p>“In all honestly, we have a ton of confidence and guys with ability,” Mars coach and Michael’s father Rob Carmody said “Michael’s presence, he’s the No. 1 rebounder in the country and, his physical presence, he’s physically different from any player whose played basketball in the WPIAL in 20 or 25 years, but it’s no excuse. We had plenty of opportunities, we played very well and, this was a game we needed to do the small things better and we did not.”</p>
<p>Without the 6-foot-7, 290-pound force in the paint, Mars (19-7) dropped a 58-56 overtime decision Friday night to Elizabethtown (20-9), the seventh-place finisher out of District 3, in the first round of the state tournament at Valley. Michael, who averaged 19 points and 19 rebounds per game, was suspended for the game by the WPIAL for his behavior in the aftermath of the Planets’ 52-51 loss to Laurel Highlands in the WPIAL championship at Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>Immediately after the game, Michael chastised an official for a non-call on a last-second Mars shot, then kicked the ball toward midcourt into the Mustangs as they celebrated the win.</p>
<p>Instead of the Notre Dame football recruit, Mars started a 5-foot-8 guard, freshman Tasso Sfanos, who finished with 14 points.</p>
<p>“We replaced a 6-7, 290 kid with a 5-7, 130 kid and I wonder if that ever happened before,” Carmody said. “But Tasso went in as a freshman in his first ever varsity start in a PIAA playoff game and I thought he played outstanding.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Class 5A</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>York Suburban 57, Laurel Highlands 56:</strong> The Mustangs will have to wait at least one more year to end their 34-year state tournament victory drought. Freshman phenom Rodney Gallagher scored a game-high 32 points and nearly carried Laurel Highlands (17-9) —- which was playing its first PIAA game since 2016 — into the second round. Anthony Brown had 16 points and 13 boards for York Suburban (22-7) in the win.</p>
<p><strong>Milton Hershey 78, Chartiers Valley 74</strong>: Brayden Reynolds scored 26 and Jared Goldstrom chipped in 25 for the Colts (19-6), but the two-man attack wasn’t enough as Milton Hershey (21-4) got 35 from Josh Parra to lead three players in double figures as the District 3 second-place finisher made it into the second round for the first time since losing to Mars in the 2018 semifinals.</p>
<p><strong>Muhlenberg 72, South Fayette 66:</strong> The Lions (16-9) trailed by 17 at halftime and fought back in the third quarter to cut the deficit to single digits late, but the Muhls hit their free throws down the stretch to eke out the win and complete the sweep of WPIAL Class 5A teams.</p>
<p><strong><em>Class 4A</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Highlands 50, Harbor Creek 40:</strong> Golden Rams senior Johnny Crise continued his inspired postseason play as the 6-foot-6 forward finished with a double-double, scoring a game-high 23 points and grabbing 15 rebounds to lead the WPIAL champions to their first state playoff win since 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Hickory 58, New Castle 48:</strong> It was a serious case of deja vu for the Red Hurricanes (17-9), whose season ended for the second year in a row on the floor of Slippery Rock University against the Hornets. Donald Whitehead led all scorers with 29 for Hickory, while Sheldon Cox paced New Castle with 20.</p>
<p><strong>Huntingdon 70, Blackhawk 57:</strong> The Cougars (13-12) could not find an answer for Nick Gearhart, who sliced up their defense for 31 points, while Jackson Ritchey chipped in 20 as the District 6 champion Bearcats (23-2) moved on. Ryan Heckathorn led Blackhawk with 18.</p>
<p><strong>Belle Vernon 65, Clearfield 60:</strong> Devin Whitlock finished with a double-double with 15 points and 11 assists as four Leopards finished in double figures in the school’s first state tournament victory since a 73-53 victory against Punxsutawney in the opening round of the 1981 Class 3A playoffs when the PIAA only had three classifications.</p>
<p><strong>Lancaster Catholic 59, Ringgold 56:</strong> The Rams, led by 20 points from Chris Peccon, were nip and tuck with Lancaster Catholic throughout, but despite putting four players in double figures, Ringgold (14-11) still has not won a state playoff game since it capped off a Class 4A title in Hershey with a 71-66 win over Williamsport in 1995.</p>
<p><strong><em>Class 1A</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cornell 74, Saltsburg 29:</strong> Zaier Harrison scored 10 of his game-high 23 in the fourth quarter and Kaden DeVito added 22 to lead four Raiders (19-7) in double figures as the WPIAL runners-up cruised to a running-clock victory over the third-place finishers out of District 6 at Fox Chapel.</p>
<p><strong>Vincentian 93, Allegheny-Clarion Valley 63:</strong> The Royals continue to make their last hurrah a memorable one as Priest Ryan scored a game-high 23, Matt McDonough notched 21 and Angelo Reeves 20 as they won a state playoff game for the third consecutive year.</p>
<p><strong>Bishop Canevin 87, Commodore Perry 35:</strong> KeVaughn Price scored a game-high 35 points and Dom Elliott 11 as the Crusaders rolled to a running-clock win.</p>
