<h1>Steelers free agency updates: Roosevelt Nix cut; Sean Davis headed to Redskins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em><strong>This story will be updated.</strong></em></p>
<p>One day after signing former Chargers fullback Derek Watt to a free agent contract, the Steelers released fullback Roosevelt Nix, a five-year veteran and former Pro Bowler who missed 13 games due to a knee injury last season.</p>
<p>The move will save the Steelers a little more than $1 million on their 2020 salary cap. Nix, who made the Steelers as an undrafted free agent in 2015, had two years remaining on his contract and was going to count $1.8 million against the cap if he was on the roster.</p>
<p>Nix made the Steelers as a special teams ace in 2015, but he earned a trip to the Pro Bowl following the 2017 season for his work as a fullback. Nix finished his five-year Steelers career with 12 receptions for 69 yards and a touchdown and four carries for four yards and one rushing touchdown. He also had 34 tackles, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery on special teams in 60 career games.</p>
<p><strong>Davis to Washington</strong></p>
<p>In a move that was expected, Sean Davis is gone from the Steelers, and now so is their 2016 draft class.</p>
<p>After missing all but one game with injuries last season, then having his free safety role filled by rising star Minkah Fitzpatrick, Davis is set to sign a one-year contract worth up to $5 million with the Washington Redskins, according to national reports. Davis is from Washington and was a second-round pick out of Maryland.</p>
<p>The Steelers leaned on Davis as a starter at both safety spots his first three seasons, when he started 40 of 47 games. Davis led the team in tackles in 2017 and 2018, but had only five career interceptions going into last season. He was banged up for much of training camp with an ankle injury that caused him to miss the season opener at New England, then injured his shoulder in Week 2 against Seattle and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/12/06/sean-davis-injury-steelers-injured-reserve-designated-return-2019/stories/201912060125" target="_blank">never returned to the lineup</a>.</p>
<p>While Davis could’ve added depth behind Fitzpatrick and strong safety Terrell Edmunds, his exit could help the Steelers a year from now. Losing him in free agency likely means the Steelers will get a compensatory draft pick in 2021, though Davis would need to play in 10 games with his new team. Javon Hargrave, Tyler Matakevich, B.J. Finney and 2016 first-rounder Artie Burns — assuming he signs elsewhere — also leaving in free agency will factor into the formula for&nbsp;“comp picks” as well. So far, the only outside free agent signed by the Steelers to negate those departures is fullback Derek Watt.</p>
