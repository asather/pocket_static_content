<h1>Buying Here: A rehabbed house in Lincoln Place for under $90,000</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Danielle Condon went house hunting three years ago, she looked at five houses before buying the one at <strong>5606 Rodgers St.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Ext.</strong> in Lincoln Place.</p>
<p>“For under $100,000 it was a done deal,” she said. “The house was completely renovated and move-in ready.”</p>
<p>The seller who rehabbed the 103-year-old cottage had updated everything, including new siding, roof and mechanicals. He also removed walls and opened up the one-bedroom, 1½-bath house in this South Hills city neighborhood.</p>
<p>The light-filled spaces were a selling point for Ms. Condron, who is moving to a larger home and has put this on the market for $89,900 (MLS No. 1442140) with Heather Knepper of Your Town Realty (<a href="https://www.yourtownpittsburgh.com/property/1442140" target="_blank">www.yourtownpittsburgh.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;412-716-5536). It is unavailable for tours due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>There is a vacant side lot next to the home that is available through the city’s Side Lot Program. It gives a buyer the opportunity to expand the property.</p>
<p>The house’s hardwood floors have been refinished and stained in a clear oak. The original staircase features the original walnut-stained banisters.</p>
<p>The open-concept living room has room for a large sofa and additional seating. The updated kitchen includes new cabinets, granite counter tops and stainless-steel appliances, including an electric range, large double bowl sink and dishwasher. There is lots of room for a dining table.</p>
<p>“We moved into a house that needs renovated,” Ms. Condon said. “I miss my granite countertops. Everything is really new and fresh there.”</p>
<p>The rear of the home has a converted mud room with a ceramic plank tile floor and a new powder room with pocket door. A door leads to a large deck and a fenced-in backyard that could accommodate a dog.</p>
<p>Upstairs, the two bedrooms and full bath have been done over.</p>
<p>“I just replaced all of the upstairs carpet and repainted the entire house,” Ms. Condon said.</p>
<p>The house has new central air-conditioning, a home warranty and a laundry in the basement. The Allegheny County Assessed value is $13,600. Two houses have sold in the 5600 block of Rodgers Street Extension over the last three years, one for $45,000 in December 2016 and this house for $78,000 in May 2017.

<p>The home is on a back street and has little traffic, Ms. Condon said. “My son could ride a bike. It was nice.”</p>
<p>It’s less than a 10-minute drive to shopping at The Waterfront in Homestead and Century III Mall in West Mifflin.&nbsp;“There is a Shop ‘n Save close to the house and a Dollar General in walking distance,” Ms. Condon said.</p>
<p>“That house was great and really saved a lot of money.”</p>
