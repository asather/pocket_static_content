<h1>West African man in 'business email compromise' scheme gets 57 months in prison</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The last of four West African swindlers who stole hundreds of thousands of dollars by posing online as parties in real estate deals is headed to federal prison for 57 months.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton imposed that term Thursday on Nathanael Nyamekye, a Ghana native living in Chippewa, Beaver County, and the owner of an auto shop in Aliquippa.</p>
<p>The 57-month term was less than the 71 prosecutors asked for but more than a probation term Nyamekye's lawyer wanted and two other co-conspirators received.</p>
<p>Judge Walton convicted him last year after a short bench trial on two counts related to the theft of $411,000 from the sale of a home in Maryland and $212,000 from the sale of another home in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Nyamekye was acting in concert with three other African natives in "business email compromise" schemes in which they used bogus emails to fool a settlement company and several lawyers into wiring money to accounts they controlled.</p>
<p>The schemes have become increasingly popular in recent years as more and more business transactions are conducted by email. Typically in real estate frauds, the schemers hack into and then monitor email exchanges and then insert themselves at the right time to request a change of wiring instructions.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Czarnecki said Nyamekye's role was to launder the stolen money. He described numerous deceits in which Nyamekye engaged, such as exploiting a homeless woman he met online by having her set up a business bank account so he could deposit a $30,000 check. At one point, Mr. Czarnecki said, Nyamekye even blamed his brother in the laundering of a $49,500 check.</p>
<p>In all, he said Nyamekye's actions caused the loss of $624,509.</p>
<p>Nyamekye's lawyer, James Brink, had argued that his client was a patsy for others and less culpable in the scheme, but Mr. Czarnecki said he was a leader who went to "great lengths" to launder money.</p>
<p>Judge Walton had previously sided with the government. In delivering his verdict, he called Nyamekye's testimony "bogus."</p>
<p>Nyamekye's co-conspirators have all been punished. Ismail Shitu, a Ghana native living Brookline, received probation and home detention, as did Adnan Ibrahim, another Ghana native who had been living in Duquesne before moving to Atlanta.</p>
<p>A Nigerian member of the conspiracy, Akintayo Bolorunduro of Atlanta, is serving 63 months in prison.</p>
<p>His role was to act as a liaison between the others and a cohort in Nigeria, Taiwo Musiliudeen Idris, who was prosecuted by Nigerian authorities.</p>
