<h1>James Conner plans to play in Week 2, doesn't care if he starts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Unlike a quarterback, or even an offensive lineman, being a “starter” at running back doesn't mean much. According to James Conner, it doesn’t mean anything to him.</p>
<p>For the past two seasons, as long as he was healthy, Conner was the Steelers’ No. 1 back. Entering Week 2 of this year, both parts of that equation are already in doubt, given Conner’s ankle injury in the opener and the emergence of backup Benny Snell in his absence.</p>
<p>“Having the ‘starter’ label, I’m not really a selfish guy,” Conner said after practice Friday, his second in a row in which he participated fully. “I just want to be able to be out there and compete.”</p>
<p>Conner called it “frustrating” that he had to leave the 26-16 season-opening win against the Giants after just 15 snaps and six carries for 9 yards. He did also have two catches for 8 yards on four targets, so the Steelers worked to get him involved early, but then the ankle issue popped up.</p>
<p>It hurt to put pressure on it, and Conner was on the sideline trying to test it out while Snell got the carries on his way to a 113-yard performance. Conner’s not even exactly sure how it happened because he couldn’t tell from the game film. He sat out the first practice of the week Monday but does not carry even a questionable designation going into Sunday’s matchup with Denver.</p>
<p>“I’ll keep on getting treatment on it, keep feeling it out, but definitely trending in the right direction,” Conner said, adding that he feels “almost” 100% going into the weekend.</p>
<p>A year ago, it was a shoulder, then a quad injury that hampered Conner and limited him to 10 games played. If Conner’s concerned about Snell taking over the bulk of the work in his second season, he’s not showing it.</p>
<p>“I just see a guy who’s constantly been improving ever since I’ve seen him step into this organization,” Conner said. “It’s so cool to see a guy just take it so serious and transform his body, and he’s playing big for us.”</p>
<p><strong>Offensive line is set</strong></p>
<p>As expected, Steelers interior linemen David DeCastro and Stefen Wisniewski did not practice again Friday, and Wisniewski has been placed on injured reserve. That means rookie Kevin Dotson will make his first NFL start at right guard, playing next to another lineman who began the season as a backup, Chuks Okorafor, at right tackle.</p>
<p>While it might seem like an overload of inexperience on one side of the line, Dotson and Okorafor do have some level of familiarity working in their favor. Okorafor’s other two starts on the offensive line at this level came at right tackle, and Dotson exclusively played right guard all four seasons he started in college.</p>
<p>“Dotson’s been eager to learn, and he’s been showing good stuff ever since training camp,” Conner said. “Running back is all reaction anyway, so I trust those guys are going to do their job.”</p>
<p>With Wisniewski on injured reserve, it should be noted the NFL has changed its IR rules this year. Wisniewski will be eligible to return after missing three games. In his place, the Steelers promoted Derwin Gray from the practice squad. The 6-foot-4, 320-pound Gray was the team’s seventh-round pick last season, but spent all of his rookie year on the practice squad. The team officially lists him as an offensive tackle, which he played in college at Maryland, but he’s a guard. That’s why he’s taking Wisniewski’s place on the active roster.</p>
<p><strong>Other roster moves</strong></p>
<p>With Curtis Riley being signed by Arizona, the Steelers brought back safety John Battle to the practice squad. Battle had been with the team all year until not making the roster or practice squad out of training camp.</p>
<p>Given that DeCastro will be one of the inactive players again Sunday, the Steelers will have a number of options for their final slot on the game day roster. DeCastro figures to be joined by No. 3 quarterback Josh Dobbs, as well as rookie defensive lineman Carlos Davis again. Tight end Zach Gentry was inactive last week, so if he’s the fourth, the Steelers will have a couple other decisions to make on who will dress for the game, and it could come down to an extra linebacker or extra running back.</p>
<p>Due to NFL rules for expanded rosters, eight offensive linemen must suit up, which means Gray will join J.C. Hassenauer and Jerald Hawkins as the backups there. Teams can call up two practice squad players per week, but the Steelers didn’t elevate anyone in Week 1. More likely is that they’ll choose to make running back Anthony McFarland active for his NFL debut after he didn’t dress last week.</p>
