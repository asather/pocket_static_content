<h1>As coronavirus spreads, infectious disease specialists counsel simple protection measures</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The new coronavirus is estimated to be about ten-fold more lethal than the seasonal flu that often fills hospital emergency rooms this time of year, and the average infected person spreads the disease to two or three others, a remarkable rate of increase.</p>
<p>More worrisome, there’s evidence the disease can be transmitted by people with mild or no symptoms, which is prompting vigilance by hospitals and consumers to mount a defense to the new virus, dubbed COVID-19.</p>
<p>“We’re still trying to get a handle on how many people will get sick,” said Kathryn S. Moffett, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at WVU Medicine in Morgantown. “Can we really contain it? I don’t know the answer to that, but I’m not in a panic.”</p>
<p>COVID-19, a respiratory virus that spreads through contact with tiny droplets from an infected person’s cough or sneeze, has sickened more than 85,000 people worldwide, including 65 people in the U.S. The virus strain was first identified in Chinese province of Hubei in December, where it’s believed to have mutated in birds before jumping to humans.</p>
<p>No one in Pennsylvania has been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, but a person from Washington State on Saturday became the disease’s first U.S. fatality.</p>
<p>There are likely more cases than those that have been counted, said Thomas Campbell, chair, department of emergency medicine at Allegheny Health Network.</p>
<p>“We believe there are a lot of cases with very mild symptoms that they don’t even know about,” Dr. Campbell said. “The very young and the very old who are ill with other diseases are the ones we worry about the most.”</p>
<p>Infectious disease specialists say the front line in preventing the spread of any virus is simple: frequent handwashing, using hand sanitizer, cover your cough with your arm (“cough etiquette”), staying home from work or school if you get sick. Disinfecting surfaces in the kitchen, bathroom and other parts of the home is another option.</p>
<p>“Your best line of defense is soap and water,” said Kathleen Rosatti, a nurse and health division director of medical outcomes, patient safety and infection control at Greensburg-based Excela Health. “Any type of disinfectant, that’s the best practice for any kind of virus.”</p>
<p>Despite rising fears, a Saturday evening visit to two large department stores north of Pittsburgh showed there were still plenty of disinfectants available on store shelves, and shoppers weren’t seen buying any extra disinfectants in the stores that were visited.</p>
<p>Excela already assures seasonal flu protection for its staff by making immunization a condition of employment, a policy started last year.</p>
<p>The new coronavirus attacks the lungs, making the disease more dangerous than other coronavirus strains, Dr. Campbell said. But wearing a surgical mask for long periods is not recommended: moisture from breathing may actually attract viruses.</p>
<p>There’s also hope for a vaccine: in a perspective piece in the latest New England Journal of Medicine, Microsoft founder Bill Gates said the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations was developing up to eight vaccine candidates, which could be ready for trials as early as June. In recent years, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has helped fund preparedness measures for a virus pandemic.</p>
<p>AHN infectious disease specialist Nitin Bhanot urged consumers to use common sense in seeking protection from the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>“People can go so crazy, even when there’s no case of COVID-19 in the state,” Dr. Bhanot said. “General disinfection is important, but going way, way beyond that —&nbsp;I’m not sure it’s needed. People should not worry too much. Fear and anxiety sometimes travel faster than the disease.”</p>
