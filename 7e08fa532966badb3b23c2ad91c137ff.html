<h1>U.S. Supreme Court denies petition against Wolf shutdown orders</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has denied a petition from April that challenged Gov. Tom Wolf's COVID-19-related shutdown order.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Republican Danny DeVito, who is running for a seat in the legislature's 45th House District covering Kennedy and Robinson, had filed a petition with the high court to stay the governor's order on the grounds that it was causing "unprecedented damage to the economy." Local businesses that had been forced to shut down also joined in the petition.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court on Monday denied the petition without explanation.</p>
<p>The case is not connected to a fight over the shutdown now before the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals or another case before the Supreme Court in which Republicans have challenged the state Supreme Court's ruling on extending vote counts.</p>
<p>"We respect the Court's decision," said the petitioners' lawyer, Marc Scaringi, in a statement. "My clients, particularly . . . Danny DeVito, will continue to challenge the Governor's COVID-19 restrictions through public advocacy."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Scaringi had argued that businesses have the right to control their own property and that the government cannot stop them from operating without due process. The petition had said that without a stay, tens of thousands of businesses may not be able to recover from financial distress caused by the shutdown.</p>
<p>The governor had issued an order on March 19 mandating that all "non-life-sustaining" businesses close to prevent the spread of the virus. He has since relaxed many of those requirements.</p>
