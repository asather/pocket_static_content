<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 07.02.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, we will begin our chat in about 30 minutes so get your questions ready...</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Hi Gerry...re: the Pats filming the Bengals sideline, light punishment, etc. Don't the morons arguing that 'It was the TV film crew, Belichick didn't know anything about it' realize that that is the PERFECT cover for Ernie Adams and Belichick to cheat again? 'Just have those guys do it, then we can deny knowing about it.' It's almost too obvious. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: i'm not sure they even know or care if they have that cover. All their past indiscretions w cheating haven't stopped them from continuing to flout the rules. They have a clinical term for that -- pathological. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Oh, by the way, we are underway...!</p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: If Pre-season is shortened, will training camp be shortened as well? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, training camp will not be affected as a result of that. That will remain the same -- at least, that's the plan. They would just like to play a game or two for health concerns -- to help the players assimilate back to the game and contact and limit the amount of injuries. Medical people are concerned that injuries will mount early in the season if there are no warmup games after not having OTAs and minicamps.</p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: What percent of the Steelers live in Pittsburgh and are already familiar with the level of restrictions/open-ness? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't know that but I'm going to guess a lot of them have been living with restrictions anyway, no matter where they are. Hey, once they get to training camps, players everywhere will be severely restricted in their bubble, no matter where they play.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: No fans at 'training camp', such as it is, but care to predict a camp darling or two? I'll say John Houston, the LB from USC has a chance due to the lack of depth at ILB. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Anthony McFarland <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Questions are slowly trickling in. Hopefully our technical difficulties are being resolved.</p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: Too harsh a penalty for the Patriots (given the frequency and consistency of breaking the rules): take away their off season, no draft picks and no signing free agents (free to re-up their own) for one year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Goodness.....too harsh.</p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: I am hoping and thinking Ben will be back and fine this season. How long into the season would you give him before being concerned if he stumbles? Seems like the last couple of years he takes a few games to get into a good grove. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I really don't think he will stumble. In fact, I think just the opposite. Barring any issues with his elbow, I believe he will come back more determined, focused and eager than ever.</p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: Would you ever want to take the time to make an all time Steelers team? Bradshaw vs Ben, Bettis or Franco, how many and which receivers or linebackers? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ok, let's try real quick... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Oops. QB -- Bradshaw. RB -- Franco and Bettis. WR -- Stallworth, Swann and Hines Ward. TE -- Miller. T -- Larry Brown and xxxx; G -- Faneca and Bruce Van Dyke; C -- Webster/Dawson (tie). <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Defense: DE -- LC Greenwood, Heyward; DT -- Joe Greene, Casey Hampton; LBs -- Lambert, Ham, Lloyd, Harrison; CB -- Woodson, Blount; S -- Shell, Polamalu. K -- Gary Anderson. P -- Craig Colquitt <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: One revision: DeCastro, not Van Dyke, at G. And I left the other tackle blank. That would be Tunch Ilkin. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, we seem to be having prolonged issues w questions getting through, so, like professional sports, we will have to postpone our chat for now.</p>
