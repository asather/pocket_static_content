<h1>A change of the guard? Downtown's historic Granite Building may be on the verge of being sold</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In what could be a bittersweet moment, Holly Brubach may be close to selling the ornate Downtown building that she poured her heart and soul -- and money -- into for nearly 15 years.</p>
<p>After nearly a year on the market, the historic Granite Building, located at the corner of Sixth Avenue and Wood Street, is under agreement to be sold.</p>
<p>Ms. Brubach declined to identify the buyer. But according to local real estate sources, it is Hullett Properties, a Vancouver-based real estate firm that has developed a 26-unit condominium project in the Strip District.</p>
<p>Breanna Tyson, principal for Hallett Properties, which now has an office in Pittsburgh, stated in an email that “I cannot confirm this information at this time.”</p>
<p>John Jackson, the Cushman &amp; Wakefield/Grant Street Associates senior vice president who has been brokering the sale, declined comment, saying only that the building was under agreement to a “very capable buyer.”</p>
<p>It’s not known at this point what plans Hallett Properties has for the slender but elegant 19th Century building designed in the same Richardsonian Romanesque style as the Allegheny County courthouse.</p>
<p>In the Strip, Hallett has developed 2554 Smallman, a mix of one- to three-bedrooms condos. According to the property website, 23 of the units have been sold.</p>
<p>It certainly would not be a stretch to think that Hallett may be considering the same use for the Granite Building.</p>
<p>Ms. Brubach originally intended to convert the nine-story building into condos after buying it for $925,000 in December 2005 during the first wave of residential construction Downtown.</p>
<p>But after the recession hit and two buyers backed out, Ms. Brubach changed course, dropping the condo plan in favor of a 104-room boutique hotel with three bars and a brasserie-style restaurant.</p>
<p>She ended up abandoning that $38 million plan after failing to convince banks to finance it during a hotel building boom Downtown. In both cases, she poured some of her own money into the projects.</p>
<p>Last August, Ms. Brubach, a former New York Times style editor, reluctantly put the building up for sale, saying that she was “really sorry not to make this work.”</p>
<p>She had hoped to leave her mark on her hometown of Pittsburgh by redeveloping the architectural gem, built in 1889-90 to house the German National Bank and to serve immigrants. It is located next to the tony Duquesne Club.</p>
<p>By December, Ms. Brubach had fielded seven offers for the real estate, with either condos or a hotel identified possible reuses.</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson said after the property was first listed last summer that it had attracted potential buyers from as far away as New York and, yes, Vancouver.</p>
