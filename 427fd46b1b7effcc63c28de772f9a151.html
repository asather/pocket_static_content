<h1>As record numbers of Pennsylvanians struggle, more ask for help </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With many businesses still partially or completely closed and unemployment climbing, some Pennsylvanians are turning to public programs to make ends meet — though far fewer than might be expected given double-digit jobless numbers and long lines at free food distribution sites.</p>
<p>State officials said last week they have seen increased enrollment in programs such as food stamps, Medical Assistance, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.</p>
<p>Increases have been “substantial, but not the surge” many anticipated, said Teresa Miller, Pennsylvania’s secretary for Human Services, speaking to reporters last week.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“Pennsylvania will get through this and public assistance is one of the most important ways of making sure that everyone gets through,” Ms. Miller said.</p>
<p>Among the increases:</p>
<p>• Enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly called food stamps, has increased by about 123,000 people since February, for a total enrollment of about 1.86 million statewide in April — a 7.1% increase.</p>
<p>• Enrollment in Medical Assistance (Medicaid) has increased by about 62,000 people since February, for a total enrollment of about 2.89 million in April — a 2.2% increase.</p>
<p>• The Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) covered about 186,000 Pennsylvania children in March. Today, CHIP enrollment is just over 200,000 children.</p>
<p>The state has also launched a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/05/08/COVID-19-Pennsylvanians-might-be-eligible-for-one-time-cash-payment-from-the-state/stories/202005080100?cid=search" target="_blank">federally funded Emergency Assistance Program, which provides a one-time payment to families below a certain income threshold</a>. As of late last week, officials had gotten more than 8,100 applications and the state had disbursed more than $1.9 million to people.</p>
<p>The jump in SNAP applications is large -— with a March to April increase larger than any single month increase during the Great Recession, according to an analysis by Pittsburgh-based advocacy group Just Harvest.</p>
<p>“What these numbers definitively say is near record numbers of Pennsylvanians are struggling with hunger right now,” said Ann Sanders, a policy advocate with Just Harvest.</p>
<p>Other states have also seen increases in people seeking assistance. An analysis of SNAP data by the Washington, D.C-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted “the rise in the number of SNAP participants in recent weeks is unprecedented, with 2 million (14%) more people accessing benefits between February and April in the 17 states that have posted such data.”</p>
<p>A dozen states have posted April enrollment data for Medicaid, and all but one show “notable increases in enrollment,” wrote Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, in an analysis earlier this month.</p>
<p>“Medicaid is a critical piece of what families need when times are tough, so it is not surprising that the economic collapse is leading to large Medicaid enrollment increases and we are now just starting to see real evidence of that happening,” she wrote.</p>
<p>However, in Pennsylvania, where close to 2 million people have sought jobless benefits since March, and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/05/22/Pennsylvania-jobless-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-pandemic/stories/202005220088" target="_blank">the unemployment rate for April hit 15.1%</a>, advocates question if everyone is able to access help who needs it.</p>
<p>“If people are able to get applications in, the applications are getting processed ... so that’s good. What we don’t know is how many people have tried applying and haven’t been able to access the application online,” said Ms. Sanders.</p>
<p>The gap between those filing for Unemployment Compensation -— 1.9 million -—and the increase in food stamp applicants — more than 100,000 — is substantial, she noted.</p>
<p>“Despite the historic increase in enrollment numbers, the number [of] people applying for benefits are surprisingly low —&nbsp;especially when compared to the flood of unemployment claims,” Ms. Sanders said.</p>
<p>Ms. Miller said human service officials believe they will see more of an uptick when people exhaust unemployment benefits. Additionally people who never have used these programs before might not know what help is available, she said.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to make sure that people who could be helped by these services know that we’re here,” she said.</p>
<p>County Assistance Offices, where people would normally be able to apply for programs in-person, are still closed.&nbsp;Pennsylvanians can apply for benefits online at <a href="/" target="_blank">www.compass.state.pa.us</a> or drop off a paper application outside their local county assistance office. They can also call the DHS hotline at 1-877-395-8930 to have a paper application mailed to them.</p>
