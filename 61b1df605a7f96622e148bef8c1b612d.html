<h1>Pitt partners with 3D printing company to develop reusable N95 mask filters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The much-touted N-95 mask is reportedly effective at preventing the transmission of COVID-19, but new mask technology just over the horizon.</p>
<p>A partnership between the University of Pittsburgh and North Huntingdon-based industrial 3D printing company ExOne has yielded new metal filters currently in testing for filtration and airflow with the goal of competing with the N95â€™s standard. (The N95 is so named as it filters at least 95% of airborne particles.)</p>
<p>The new metal filters would could be sterilized for repeated reuse, which could help with the current shortage of personal protective equipment and reduce medical waste.</p>
<p>Currently, an issue with the N95 mask is that it can only be sterilized a few times before losing its integrity.</p>
<p>ExOne is using copper, which is known to have antibacterial properties, and stainless steel and testing a wide range of porosity levels. If the design is successful, the filters can be 3D printed in a variety of shapes to fit respirators, ventilators, anesthesia masks and other equipment.</p>
