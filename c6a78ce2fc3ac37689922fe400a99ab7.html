<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man involved in a Pittsburgh cocaine ring was sentenced Thursday to five years in federal prison.</p>
<p>Brian Horvath, 48, of Forest Hills,&nbsp;was among 12 indicted in March 2018 for conspiring to distribute cocaine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dozen men from Allegheny and Westmoreland counties had been under a 14-month federal wiretap investigation into two interrelated cocaine trafficking rings — the culmination of which yielded the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2018/03/28/Pittsburgh-cocaine-drug-rings-indictments-federal-investigation-Scott-Brady/stories/201803280111" target="_blank">indictment of a reputed ringleader</a> from Plum.</p>
<p>From roughly September 2016 to Nov. 30, 2017, Horvath&nbsp;“frequently” received cocaine from two of his co-defendants “in quantities ranging from, at the beginning of the conspiracy, one-half ounce to, towards the end of the conspiracy, 18 ounces, which he then redistributed to various individuals in Allegheny and Westmoreland County,” according to the U.S. attorney’s office.</p>
<p>Horvath was&nbsp;sentenced in the Western District of Pennsylvania by U.S. District Judge Arthur J. Schwab for one felony count for intent to distribute more than five but less than 15 kilograms of cocaine.</p>
<p>Upon release from prison, Horvath will face three years of supervision, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.</p>
