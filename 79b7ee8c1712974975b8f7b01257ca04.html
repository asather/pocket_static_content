<h1>County Council committee hears testimony on ordinance for 'less lethal' weapon ban</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Peaceful demonstrators who have attended recent protests in Pittsburgh should not be treated&nbsp;“like enemies of the state,” one witness told the Allegheny County Council committee tasked with considering a bill to ban “less lethal” crowd control weapons, including tear gas, bean bag rounds and&nbsp;“sponge” rounds.</p>
<p>The Health and Human Services Committee, chaired by Cindy Kirk, R-McCandless, met Tuesday to discuss an ordinance sponsored by members Olivia Bennett, D-Northview Heights, and Bethany Hallam, D-at large.</p>
<p>The committee did not vote but heard from Richard Garland, assistant professor of behavioral and community health at the University of Pittsburgh; Brandi Fisher, head of the Alliance for Police Accountability; and county police Superintendent Coleman McDonough.</p>
<p>Ms. Fisher, who has asthma, told members that she and her two children were exposed to tear gas at a May 30 protest in Downtown, one of many local demonstrations&nbsp;in response to the death of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and other instances of police brutality against Black men and women.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Fisher said they had to run several blocks before they could fully breathe again.</p>
<p>“You made it through with your two children, God bless you. I just want to make sure that you think about those things next time you want to go to one of those events,” Councilman Bob Macey, D-West Mifflin, said in his questioning of Ms. Fisher.</p>
<p>“Your statement that if I attend a protest with my children we ‘should think about those things’ is the reason why I’m on the call right now so that we don’t have to think about those things because no one going to a protest to exercise their First Amendment right should have to worry,” Ms. Fisher said, criticizing that the “less lethal” weapons were deployed on innocent bystanders.&nbsp;“... This is not about being against the police; it’s about being for people.”</p>
<p>Thousands of people demonstrated peacefully in Downtown on May 30 for hours before <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/05/30/A-peaceful-protest-turns-violence-pittsburgh-george-floyd/stories/202005300072" target="_blank">violence erupted between police and protesters</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/06/02/business-damage-protests-racism-police-brutality-Black-Lives-Matter-Pittsburgh/stories/202006010100" target="_blank">several businesses were damaged and looted</a>.&nbsp;Four men have been charged, including one facing federal counts, in setting fire to two police cruisers. The Allegheny County District Attorney’s office <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/08/Pittsburgh-protests-criminal-charges-withdrawn-police-evidence-conduct-39/stories/202006080101" target="_blank">dropped charges of failure to disperse and disorderly conduct against 39 others</a>&nbsp;for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>The city of Pittsburgh’s Citizen Police Review Board is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/03/Pittsburgh-citizen-police-review-board-protest-east-liberty-tear-gas-floyd/stories/202006030102" target="_blank">investigating the police response to recent protests</a>, including when police fired tear gas, pepper spray, bean bags and “sponge” rounds on June 1 in East Liberty, an incident that is now the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/29/pittsburgh-protest-lawsuit-east-liberty-constitutional-class-action-george-floyd-rulli-peduto-hissrich-schubert/stories/202006290058" target="_blank">subject of a federal lawsuit</a>&nbsp;brought about by those injured.</p>
<p>Superintendent McDonough told the committee that devices, including flash bangs, sponge rounds and bean bags, are used in SWAT situations by county police and other regional police forces to “end a lethal threat without using deadly force.”</p>
<p>“The way this ordinance appears to be written to me ... it appears to prohibit the use of these less lethal devices in any situation, which would include patrol use, SWAT use. And again, I would say we need them for an option by well-trained officers with good policies used in crowd control, as one of the council members said, when it’s no longer a peaceful protest but a violent mob,” Superintendent McDonough said.</p>
<p>The committee will meet again Wednesday to discuss the measure.</p>
