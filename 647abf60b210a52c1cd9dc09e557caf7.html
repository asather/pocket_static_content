<h1>Fayette County priest charged with sexual assault</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Authorities on Wednesday arrested a Roman Catholic priest from the Diocese of Greensburg on charges that he sexually assaulted an altar boy on multiple occasions from 2004 to 2007, beginning when the alleged victim was 11.</p>
<p>The Rev. Andrew Kawecki surrendered to agents of the office of Attorney General Josh Shapiro in Fayette County, where the alleged offenses occurred, according to the office.</p>
<p>Father Kawecki, 65, is charged with involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, a felony; corruption of minors, a misdemeanor; and two counts of indecent assault, one a felony and the other a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>The Diocese of Greensburg had announced in May 2019 that Father Kawecki had been placed on leave pending investigation of an allegation. At the time, he had been a priest&nbsp;at St. John the Baptist Church in Scottdale and at St. Joseph Church in Everson.</p>
<p>The diocese said in a statement Wednesday it received its&nbsp;“first and only allegation against Father Kawecki” from a person filing a claim with the diocese’s compensation program for victims of abuse. The diocese said it notified PA ChildLine and local law enforcement.</p>
<p>The alleged victim told investigators that he was repeatedly subject to sexual offenses by Father Kawecki while an altar server at SS. Cyril &amp; Methodius Parish in Fairchance, Fayette County.</p>
<p>The Fayette County district attorney’s office referred the matter to the attorney general’s office due to the latter’s&nbsp;“extensive data base and expertise in investigations of clergy of various denominations,” according to the affidavit of probable cause filed in Father Kawecki’s arrest.</p>
<p>The attorney general’s office oversaw <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/faith-religion/2018/08/14/Attorney-general-josh-Shapiro-grand-jury-findings-report-on-sexual-abuse-Pennsylvania-dioceses/stories/201808140121" target="_blank">a grand jury investigation</a> into the Greensburg Diocese and five others, releasing a report in 2018 and leading to the conviction of another priest of the diocese, John Sweeney.</p>
<p>Father Kawecki was arraigned Wednesday before&nbsp;Magisterial District Judge Daniel Shimshock. Bond was set at $50,000 unsecured bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Sept. 9.</p>
<p>The alleged victim, now an adult, told investigators that Father Kawecki instructed him to arrive early for altar duty and often had him stay late, according to the affidavit of probable cause filed by Special Agent Stephen Adametz of the attorney general’s office. It was during those times the alleged abuse occurred, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>The alleged victim said that on multiple occasions, the priest required the boy to masturbate him, and that one time he forced the boy to perform oral sex on him, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>The alleged victim’s parents told investigators that their son had enjoyed serving as an altar server for the predecessor of Father Kawecki and that he was a&nbsp;“happy go lucky kid, involved in sports.” Afterward he became subject to “rage, depression, chemical dependency and eventually several suicide attempts.”</p>
<p>The parents knew something was wrong but didn’t know of the alleged abuse until their son told them last year, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>They had left the parish in 2007 over dissatisfaction with Father Kawecki but didn’t suspect their son was being abused, they said.</p>
<p><strong>Bishop Malesic responds to abuse crisis</strong></p>
<p>In a separate report issued by the Greensburg Diocese on Wednesday, Bishop Edward Malesic gave a summary of his response to the abuse crisis toward the end of his tenure, which will conclude in September when he becomes bishop of Cleveland.</p>
<p>The report said the diocese has paid a total of $5.9 million to 72 survivors of abuse through its compensation fund, launched in the wake of the grand jury report. That’s up from the figures in an interim report by the diocese last October: $4.4 million to 57 survivors.</p>
<p>Most Pennsylvania dioceses set up compensation funds in the wake of the 2018 grand jury report, detailing a 70-year history of allegations of sexual abuse by priests and cover-ups by bishops in six dioceses.</p>
<p>The Greensburg Diocese also reported that it is adding a name to its list of 21 priests credibly accused of sexually abusing minors, none of whom are in ministry now.</p>
<p>The newly added name is the Rev. Emil Payer, who was already removed from ministry in 2011 amid an investigation into his handling of parish finances. He ultimately pleaded guilty to charges related to the theft of $98,000 in church funds.</p>
<p>But the diocese said there were no allegations of sexual abuse in his file until it was alerted in 2018 of a law enforcement investigation into two allegations. It said the Indiana County district attorney’s office and state police determined the allegations, dating back to the 1980s, could not be prosecuted under the statute of limitations, but did not make any conclusions on the merits of the allegations.</p>
<p>The diocese hired its own independent investigators, who interviewed the victims and others. The diocese’s independent review board then determined the allegations were “credible and substantiated,” according to the diocese.</p>
<p>Father Payer denies the allegations, the diocese said.</p>
