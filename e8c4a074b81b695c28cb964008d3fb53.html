<h1>Mummies and shrunken heads help students, police officers connect outside of school</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Part of an ongoing effort to foster relationships between law enforcement and the communities they serve, three Pittsburgh police officers had help from some unlikely artifacts&nbsp;— mummified priests, shrunken heads and the skeletons of cats and blowfish.</p>
<p>The three Zone 1 officers walked among mummified bodies, both human and animal, with students from the Manchester Academic Charter School Saturday, as they learned about how bodies decompose, what scientists can learn from the mummies and what the afterlife looks like for different cultures.</p>
<p>The students and officers were visiting the Carnegie Science Center’s Mummies of the World: The Exhibition, an initiative led by the museum to connect law enforcement and students, and bring the wonders of science to both communities.</p>
<p>“It’s our opportunity to get kids excited about science. This is just one specific topic that affects their everyday lives,” said Connie George, senior director of marketing and community relations for the Science Center.</p>
<p>The museum orchestrated the visit Saturday, the first in a series of events it would like to host for officials from all six police zones, Ms. George said. It started with Zone 1 since the museum is in their neighborhood.</p>
<p>As the kids walked through the exhibit, many of them had trouble believing the mummies were not plastic but actually once living beings.</p>
<p>The docents told them stories of superstitions that were perfect fodder for nightmares, like the fact that the lips of some mummies were sewn together so the soul couldn’t escape the body when it came back to life. Or that buildings used to be constructed with cats in the walls because some cultures believed that was the only way to protect against evil spirits.</p>
<p>The exhibit, which is open until April, offers a window into the “science of death” and prompts conversations about the history of life and death, Ms. George said.</p>
<p>Though it doesn’t usually involve talk of souls coming back to life and haunted spirits, the police department has made it a priority to connect with kids, said Sgt. Tiffany Costa. The department brings kids and officers together to attend Steelers games, learn about the work of EMTs or the SWAT team, go ice skating or swimming.</p>
<p>The efforts are part of an ongoing initiative to ease tensions between law enforcement and community members. The city created a community outreach office to make it clear to both the officers and the public that community building initiatives were just as important as the department’s other responsibilities, Sgt. Costa said.</p>
<p>“It helps in case the kids ever do need help in the future,” she said. “You need to build that partnership. ... The whole key is building bridges.”</p>
<p>Pam Watson, the food service director at the Manchester Academic Charter School, the basketball coach for the boys and girls teams at the school and the student’s chaperone at the museum, said the kids already had a positive relationship with the officers they toured the museum with that day. Two of them regularly visit the school.</p>
<p>Though they might not realize the impact of Saturday’s visit right away, she said it was the type of day the kids would look back on fondly as an example of police officers having fun and giving back to their community.</p>
<p>“You got to give back to get something back,” she said.&nbsp;“It’s important so they can learn, they can trust, they don’t have to be afraid of the police.”</p>
