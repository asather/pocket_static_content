<h1>Michael Cohen has ‘so much’ to say after release from prison amid coronavirus scare</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NEW YORK — Michael Cohen, the disgraced former personal attorney to President Donald Trump, walked out of a federal prison in upstate New York on Thursday and quickly promised to dish on his former boss — just not right now.</p>
<p>“I am so glad to be home and back with my family,” Cohen tweeted after arriving at his Upper East Side home, where he will serve the remainder of his three-year sentence. “There is so much I want to say and intend to say. But now is not the right time. Soon. Thank you to all my friends and supporters.”</p>
<p>Cohen, 53, wasn’t supposed to get out until November 2021 at the earliest, but the Justice Department is letting hundreds of inmates convicted of nonviolent crimes serve their stints in home confinement in a bid to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.</p>

<p>Cohen, who’s working on a tell-all book about Trump, left the federal lockup in Otisville in the early morning and arrived at his posh Manhattan pad shortly before 11 a.m., wearing a face mask, a University of Miami cap, jeans and a black blazer.</p>
<p>The president’s former lawyer, with help from his son, carried several boxes of legal documents into his luxury apartment building, which is just a few blocks from Trump Tower.</p>
<p>He did not stop to talk with reporters.</p>
<p>However, responding to a tweet from a journalist saying he had “mumbled something,” Cohen explained he had praised the gathered reporters.</p>
<p>“I thanked the media,” he posted.</p>
<p>The virus has infected at least 14 inmates and guards at the upstate facility that housed Cohen.</p>
<p>Cohen was initially supposed to get out at the beginning of May, but his release was derailed at the last minute, sparking rumors that Trump had gotten involved.</p>
<p>Having served as Trump’s legal and political fixer for more than a decade, Cohen publicly broke with him last year after pleading guilty to a string of federal crimes, including facilitating illegal hush money payments to a couple of the president’s alleged mistresses shortly before the 2016 election.</p>
<p>Cohen testified before Congress last year that Trump has committed several crimes since taking office, including fraud.</p>
<p>He has called on lawmakers to hunt down Trump’s tax returns, alleging the long-sought documents will prove the president’s crimes.</p>
