<h1>Pitt's Blue-Gold scrimmage to air on ACC Network</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt's Blue-Gold Spring Game is set to air nationally for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p>The Panthers' annual spring game will kick at 5 p.m. on April 11 at Heinz Field, airing on ACC Network. More details are forthcoming in regards to fan entry and parking, according to a Pitt spokesperson.</p>
<p>The intrasquad scrimmage — a game that last aired nationally on NFL Network in 2010 — will close Pitt's spring camp, which begins Monday.</p>
<p>Pat Narduzzi's Panthers have 15 spring practices, with the Blue-Gold affair being the 15th, to usher in a crop of mid-year enrollees and prepare for an anticipated 2020 campaign. Of the 20 players Pitt signed this recruiting cycle, eight (six high school prospects, two transfers) joined the program in January.</p>
<p>The spring game will be fans' first look at Florida graduate transfer tight end Lucas Krull and Arizona State transfer quarterback Joey Yellen. Freshmen, such as wide receiver Jordan Addison and running back Israel Abanikanda, a pair of potential 2020 contributors, are also expected to make their Heinz Field debuts.</p>
