First, forward Marcus Weathers drilled a 3-pointer; then, guard Sincere Carry stole the ball and hit an easy transition layup; finally, Weathers finished the run himself, polishing off a tough and-one layup to extend the lead to 7.</p><p>The Dukes (11-2, 1-0 Atlantic 10 Conference) maintained that momentum, turning defense into offense and playing with high energy the rest of the way to win, 73-59, in the opening game of conference play. Saint Louis fell to 11-3, 0-1.</p><p>That hard-working style is indicative of the past few days of practice, according to Dambrot, who said he worked his players hard after consecutive losses to UAB and Marshall.</p><p>“You don’t ever want to lose,” Dambrot said. “The fragility of this sport is crazy. It’s kind of like a closer that blows a close. He might have had 15 straight, and then he blows one, and then psychologically blows the next one, and pretty soon it snowballs on him. It’s the same thing. Most people are front-runners, and when things go poorly they have trouble rallying themselves, so you never wanna go three, four games in a row.</p><p>“... I just think we kinda lost our edge. A little tired, a little messed up in the head. I just think we kinda lost it for a couple, three games.”</p><p>A large part of Duquesne’s defensive energy was due to forward Michael Hughes’ rim protection. He tied a career high with seven blocks, five of which came in a two-minute span at the beginning of the second half.</p><p>The trouble, as it has been for Hughes for a fair number of games, was his fouls. With 8:28 left in the game, he picked up his fourth, and Saint Louis crawled to within 4 points with 5:51 to go.</p><p>But the Dukes had one more run in them to pull away for good. First, guard Tavian Dunn-Martin drilled a contested 3. Forward Baylee Steele followed suit moments later, and two free throws from Weathers put Duquesne ahead, 62-50, with 4:48 left.</p><p>From there, the Billikens hung around as best they could, continuing to play aggressive defense. While some of that resulted in Duquesne turnovers, much of the time it led to fouls and free throws. The Dukes went 20 of 25 from the line.</p><p>“That’s coaching,” Dambrot said, laughing. “No. So, you know what kills me is I’ve had a lot of bad free-throw shooting teams. ... And people say, ‘Well don’t they practice?’ Duh. Everybody practices them. But a lot of it is mental, and a lot of it is physical. We’re making more free throws. We put time in, but we have a good free-throw shooting team, and the right guys got fouled too.”</p><p>Dunn-Martin was the offensive catalyst when times were tough. This former sixth man of the year in the Atlantic 10 had started all season but came off the bench for the first time Thursday, and looked right at home.</p><p>He went 5 for 9 from deep, hitting a lot of his shots when the Dukes absolutely needed one. He finished with 21 points, only outdone by Weathers, who tallied a steady 26 points, marking a career-high and the fifth consecutive game that Weathers has led the team in scoring.</p><p>“I just feel good coming into every game,” Weathers said. “I just think the biggest credit is to my teammates, because they just allow me to be me every time I’m on the floor, and they just allow me to go out there and do what I normally do.”</p><p>Duquesne padded its offensive stats in the second half, but the first half was tough in that regard.</p><p>The Dukes were dead set on feeding the post, but Saint Louis’ size and propensity for double teams made things tough in the paint. As a result, Duquesne had just 8 points in the paint at halftime.</p><p>The Dukes still took a slim, 28-25 lead into the break, though, setting the stage for a big second half to pull away from the Billikens and start the conference season with a win.</p><p><em>Mike Persak: mpersak@post-gazette.com and Twitter @MikeDPersak.</em></p></body></html>
