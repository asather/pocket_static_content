<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday announced that all K-12 schools in Pennsylvania would be closed for 10 business days beginning Monday in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The governor said the decision was made in consultation with&nbsp;school districts as well as state and local officials.</p>
<p>“We understand that these are trying times and recognize the impact of the coronavirus on our students and communities,” Mr. Wolf said in a statement. “First and foremost, my top priority as governor – and that of our education leaders – must be to ensure the health and safety of our students and school communities.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said the state will reevaluate at the end of the 10-day period and decide whether continued closure is needed.</p>
<p>Many school districts in Western Pennsylvania have already announced closures of two weeks or more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hours before the announcement, two state lawmakers from Western Pennsylvania and a Pittsburgh Public School board member had urged Mr. Wolf to close all schools.&nbsp;The governors of Ohio, Maryland and West Virginia decided to close all K-12 schools in their states over the past two days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The governor said no school would be penalized if it failed to meet the 180 day or school hour requirement.</p>
<p>The state Department of Education&nbsp;will work with intermediate units and other education stakeholders to assist school districts with any continuity of learning plans.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Bob Casey released a statement commending Gov. Wolf for the decision to close schools throughout the state.</p>
<p>“This is a difficult time for our state and our nation,” he said. “In order to effectively combat this virus, we need the government, the private sector, health care providers and citizens all working together during this pandemic.”</p>
<p>A cohort of eight state education organizations, including the&nbsp;Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators, Pennsylvania School Boards Association, Pennsylvania State Education Association and the Pennsylvania Principals Association, also praised the decision to shut down schools.</p>
<p>“We agree that this action will create an ability for better social distancing, which helps prevent the spread of the virus, and will provide schools with the opportunity to further address facility cleaning and prepare for instruction going forward, along with other outstanding issues,” the groups said.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department said Friday that there were no presumptive cases of COVID-19 in the county.&nbsp;</p>
