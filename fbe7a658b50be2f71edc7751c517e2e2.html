<h1>Sidney Crosby practices with Penguins; status for exhibition uncertain</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After months of uncertainty, weeks of socially distant speculation and a rushed ramp up to an unprecedented training camp, it’s happened. The Penguins are in the bubble.</p>
<p>Phase Four of the NHL’s four-step, return-to-play plan officially began in earnest this week. The Penguins held their first practice on Monday in the Eastern Conference’s hub in Toronto. On Tuesday at 4 p.m. they’ll play the one and only exhibition against the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
<p>Then on Saturday, things get real — really real. The NHL will officially push play on the game they paused amid the COVID-19 pandemic on March 12.</p>
<p>For the players, it’s all starting to sink it. This is happening.</p>
<p>“Going through Phase 2 and Phase 3 process, there was a chance something could go wrong and things wouldn’t quite work out as well as you would have hoped,” Rust said. “Right when we got on the plane and when we got here, we realized this thing is a go. We’re here to play for the Stanley Cup.”</p>
<p>The NHL announced on Monday that from July 18 to July 25, more than 800 players were tested and the league found no positive results for COVID-19. Players and staff will continue to be tested daily. But to clear this hurdle and enter a secure environment would seem to be a significant step toward awarding a Stanley Cup, a goal commissioner Gary Bettman has clung to since mid-March.</p>
<p>“You never know what is going to happen,” Penguins forward Jake Guentzel said. “I think the NHL has done a good job with this bubble. As players, we know we have to be safe. That’s the first and foremost thing.”</p>
<p>With the first priority of safety out of the way, the next topic naturally is health. Since Sidney Crosby left the first intrasquad scrimmage of camp on July 18, his status has been discussed and dissected often.</p>
<p>On Monday, Crosby practiced in a full capacity. His status for Tuesday’s 4 p.m. exhibition game against the Philadelphia Flyers remains unclear.</p>
<p>“We’ll make that decision tomorrow,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said.</p>
<p>Monday marked the second time Crosby has been part of a full-team event since leaving the ice early more than a week ago. He also practiced on Friday. On Saturday, Crosby skated individually instead of attending the team’s instrasquad scrimmage.</p>
<p>Crosby missed 28 games after undergoing sports hernia surgery in November. He rejoined the lineup Jan. 14, tallying four points that night. He had 11 goals and 30 points in 24 games after coming back.</p>
<p>“It’s obviously nice to have him out there,” Guentzel said. “He’s a catalyst for our team. Whenever he’s out there, just the way that he plays, I think he makes us that much better.”</p>
<p><strong>Hug it out</strong></p>
<p>Saturday’s scrimmage included a brief, but tense, moment when Brandon Tanev and Jared McCann dropped the gloves. The coaches called it off before it escalated into blows. Tanev laughed when the subject was brought up during Monday’s interview session.</p>
<p>“We’re great friends and great teammates,” Tanev said. “Had a little fun out there and things got heated. We hugged and made up as soon as the play was done. That’s hockey.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Penguins will have their chance to hit somebody else when the Penguins play the Flyers.</p>
<p>“I think it will be a really intense game,” Guentzel said. “You only get one tune-up against another team before the playoffs and then it’s all-go. I think both teams need to get that fire under themselves.”</p>
<p><strong>Bracing for a silent setting</strong></p>
<p>Rust said he’s seen a number of the renderings for how the arena will be set up without any fans. The Penguins have also played several intense instrasqaud scrimmages without fans. But Tuesday will be their first chance to see what it’s like to play another team in that setting.</p>
<p>“It will be a different environment,” Rust said. “Each team is going to be on an even playing ground. It doesn’t matter if you’re technically the home or the away team, you’re going to be playing in the same environment.”</p>
<p><strong>Settling into a new home</strong></p>
<p>On Sunday night and Monday morning, the Penguins began to embrace what they hope will be their new digs for the next several weeks.</p>
<p>Inside their hotel rooms, each player got a taste of home. They were greeted by a display of photos. For some players that mean pictures of their wives, family and friends, children — or in the case of forward Zach Aston-Reese, his new puppy.</p>
<p>“I’ve been getting updates on my dog from my parents every day,” Aston-Reese said. “He made the transition pretty well.”</p>
<p>Aston-Reese said many of the Penguins brought their gaming systems. Rust and Aston-Reese also got into the board game Catan during the quarantine they spent together. Players are used to spending plenty of time on the road and many nights in hotels. This is just a bit different.</p>
<p>“A little nerve wracking,” Rust said. “But it’s also exciting.”</p>
