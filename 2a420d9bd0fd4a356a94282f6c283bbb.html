<h1>'I am willing to test fate to pay my bills': Uber, Lyft drivers weigh health risk, financial pressures amid outbreak</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Max Blechman was cleaning his car last Sunday after a day of shuttling Uber riders around the city for early St. Patrick’s Day festivities. The next day, he started to feel sick.</p>
<p>By Wednesday, he was taking steps to get tested for COVID-19. By Thursday, he was ordered to quarantine while he awaited the test results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Blechman, of Point Breeze, has been driving for the ride-hailing service full-time for nearly a year. While he waited for the test results, he decided to stop giving rides. Now, he’ll have to wait at least 14 days.</p>
<p>“I’m lucky. I’m 25. I have the ability to take the financial hit. ... I’m at this point more concerned for my fellow drivers,” he said. “People are concerned about their health, the health of loved ones.</p>
<p>“I hate to say this, because it does sound a little callous, but so many of us are living paycheck to paycheck [that] I think most of us are most concerned about how this is going to affect us financially.”</p>
<p>Mr. Blechman —&nbsp;like so many drivers that Pittsburghers rely on to get them to and from work, friends’ homes, or bars and restaurants — is worried about paying his bills.</p>
<p>As COVID-19 spread through the state and government officials increasingly advised people to stay home to slow the virus, ride-hailing drivers and delivery workers were forced to make difficult decisions: Did they prioritize their health or their income?</p>
<p>“I am willing to test fate to pay my bills,” said Hope Boss, who drives Uber part time to supplement income from her full-time job in logistics. The extra money covers unplanned bills, like veterinary visits, paying down loans and credit cards, and travel expenses to visit family out of state, she said.</p>
<p>“As long as the ride requests are coming in, I’ll be out driving in the evenings and on the weekends,” Ms. Boss said.</p>
<p><strong>‘If it hits, it hits’</strong></p>
<p>At first, ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft expected the spread of the virus to help business.</p>
<p>People probably wouldn’t want to take the bus or other public transportation, so they would be more likely to order a ride. At the same time, people who already didn’t want to leave their house would turn to a platform like Uber Eats to get takeout delivered.</p>
<p>But as more and more cases have been recorded in Pennsylvania, almost everything has stopped operating as usual. Early last week, Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all restaurants and bars to close except for takeout orders, advised all nonessential businesses to have employees work from home and closed all K-12 schools. Most colleges and universities also have closed their doors for the rest of the spring semester.</p>
<p>That meant there were fewer and fewer requests for drivers, no matter how willing they are to stay out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ve moved fast to ensure our business remains on solid footing,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi&nbsp;said in a call with investors March 19. “The most important thing to know is that we’re well-positioned to weather this crisis and emerge even stronger.</p>
<p>“I know our business is incredibly resilient and will bounce back but I recognize that many people —&nbsp;drivers, couriers, restaurant workers — are suffering right now,” he said.</p>
<p>In Seattle, one of the areas that has been hit hardest by the spread of the virus, Uber has seen a 60-70% decrease in bookings since the same time last year, Mr. Khosrowshahi said.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh on March 14, which was widely celebrated as an early St. Patrick’s Day — usually one of the busiest days for ride-share requests — Ms. Boss had 50% fewer rides than usual.</p>
<p>Most years, drivers make well over $1,000 on St. Paddy’s. This year, most made around $500 for the entire weekend, Mr. Blechman said, based on what he had seen in Facebook groups and conversations with other drivers.</p>
<p>Andreas Cummings, who has been driving for four years, usually makes around $800 on a regular Thursday morning rush-hour shift. This Thursday, he made only $250.</p>
<p>Usually, his first two or three trips of the day are to and from the airport.</p>
<p>Mr. Cummings, 58, of McCandless, changed his strategy to protect himself: He would take people to the airport, but he wouldn’t pick them up. He wouldn’t take rides to or from hospitals or senior care facilities. And he wasn’t afraid to ask someone to leave his car if they weren’t covering their mouth while coughing.</p>
<p>“I have to take precautions of my own. If people can’t just have the courtesy to cover their mouths, then at that point there’s nothing I can do,” he said. “I’m not putting myself at that kind of risk.”</p>
<p>Like many drivers, Mr. Cummings wipes his car down after every ride and keeps plenty of Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer available for himself and passengers.</p>
<p>“I just hope people understand we’re doing what we can to keep them safe, and I hope they realize that we expect the same from them,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Calculating the risk</strong></p>
<p>To make up for the lack of Uber rides, Mr. Cummings began spending more time delivering groceries through Instacart. Most people leave a note asking him to leave the groceries by the door or the porch to minimize direct contact.</p>
<p>It doesn’t bother Mr. Cummings that people are relying on him to fill in for tasks they don’t feel safe doing themselves — and he understands that many people simply can’t leave the house right now. It does bother him when people only tip $1 or $2 for a delivery of $200 worth of groceries that he packs and unpacks himself.</p>
<p>“People want you to go out and shop for them, deliver for them and don’t realize the risk you’re taking to do this. And there’s no money in it for them,” he said. “It’s tough for everybody, I understand that, sometimes I don’t think people realize what we have to go through to get the stuff to them.”</p>
<p>In an effort to mitigate some of the risk to drivers, Uber has said it will pay drivers for up to 14 days if they have COVID-19 or have been instructed to quarantine or self-isolate by a medical professional. Lyft has also said it will provide funds to affected drivers.</p>
<p>Still, both companies have been criticized for not doing enough to protect their workers. As Mr. Cummings puts it, they are not doing anything to incentivize people to stay home and prevent the spread.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh chapter of Rideshare Drivers United, a national organization that advocates for drivers, has started a petition urging Allegheny County to put protections in place for gig economy workers.</p>
<p>The organization, led by Mr. Blechman, is demanding changes to the newly enacted paid sick leave ordinance, which guarantees every employee in the city of Pittsburgh access to earned sick time.</p>
<p>Among other demands, Rideshare Drivers United is arguing that the ordinance also should apply to independent contractors, like ride-hailing and delivery drivers, and that employees should be compensated for lost tips or commission when they use sick time.</p>
<p>“This whole thing is really exposing some of the flaws of the gig economy to people,” Mr. Blechman said.</p>
<p>In another effort to prevent the spread of the virus, Uber and Lyft stopped offering carpool rides, where multiple people share the same ride. Uber also began offering free delivery on its Uber Eats app.</p>
<p><strong>‘Directly in the firing line’</strong></p>
<p>When Selena Brookins, 67, of Penn Hills, was out driving recently, she started making it a practice to offer people hand sanitizer as soon as they got in the car. For the most part, passengers turned it down.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ms. Brookins said she doesn’t plan to stop driving. After spending 40 years in the health care field, she said she’s seen it all.</p>
<p>“I haven’t been sick in a long time, and with me, the biggest fear is fear itself,” Ms. Brookins said.</p>
<p>She started driving for Uber about three years ago when she retired, partly for something to fill her time and partly to supplement for Social Security payments. Social Security sometimes leaves her deciding between filling her car with gas or buying groceries.</p>
<p>“I had money in savings, but that’s been dwindling down,” she said.</p>
<p>“As an Uber driver, yeah, I’m going to miss that extra money for sure. There’s no school buses, so you’re not getting stuck behind them anymore&nbsp;— that might be a blessing,” Ms. Brookins said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jeremy Wescoat, 38, of Mount Washington, began driving in May 2019 after starting a travel business with his wife. Now, as fewer people travel or are looking for rides, Mr. Wescoat said both sources of his income are taking a hit.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, at this point, both of my jobs are directly in the firing line,” he said.</p>
<p>If the ride requests stop altogether, Mr. Wescoat said his family could rely on his wife’s income, “but we’re not going to be doing much more than surviving.”</p>
