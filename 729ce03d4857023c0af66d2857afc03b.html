<h1>Jotting notes, fidgeting, yawning: Impeachment trial offers rare view of powerful jury box </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Americans watching broadcasts of President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial last week were treated to a steady diet of individual speakers, with government-operated cameras trained at one of three podiums. Occasionally, during a break in the action, they could see a distant shot of the gilded chamber.</p>
<p>The Senate Press Gallery has a far more expansive view. Perched above the front of chamber, the gallery faces all 100 senators such that reporters can observe their real-time reactions: their attentive postures, fidgets, note-taking, heavy sighs, teeth-picking, leg-stretching, head-shaking, occasional yawning and, perhaps, some nodding off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though it betrayed little emotion to journalists attempting to glean any insight into their thinking, the gallery offered the most immediate reading of the country’s most powerful jury box — of jurors tasked with deciding whether to remove the president from office.</p>
<p>The historic trial, which began in earnest last Tuesday and will span six days a week until a verdict, created an extraordinary scene that most of the country won’t ever see.&nbsp;With the access came unprecedented restrictions on reporting imposed by Senate leadership.</p>
<p>Thanks to the famously stubborn and arcane rules of the U.S. Senate, all electronic devices, including phones or recorders, are banned inside the chamber. No exceptions were allowed for journalists, over objections from the committee that oversees regulations in the press gallery.</p>
<p>The Senate also limited the movement of journalists to “pens” — a few tight spaces partitioned by ropes —&nbsp;when senators took short breaks. The rule effectively prevented reporters from asking questions of any senator who did not decide to walk over and share thoughts. (And there were not many who did so.)</p>
<p>Senate officials said the rules were necessary to ensure the safety of public officials, but reporters pointed out the rules exceeded those imposed during the president’s annual State Of The Union speech in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The restrictions “fail to acknowledge what currently works on Capitol Hill,” read a statement from the Standing Committee of Correspondents, the group of reporters that self-police the press gallery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Regional Reporters Association, which represents Washington correspondents working for regional news organizations, including the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said the rules “serve no purpose but to hinder the public from learning about their public officials and journalists from doing their job to provide that information.”</p>
<p>Therefore, the chamber took on the center of the action. Most of the time, the grand room held a sober mood, with stony-faced senators confined to their wooden desks as if at a college lecture. The Senate sergeant-in-arms began each day with a warning — largely symbolic — that senators were required to be silent&nbsp;“under pain of imprisonment.”</p>
<p>No coffee was permitted, only glasses of still or sparking water and — thanks to another obscure Senate precedent — milk. (No milk was spotted last week.)</p>
<p>Some senators wrote notes to each other to communicate without speaking. Many senators occasionally stood up stiffly to stretch their legs and to use the bathroom.</p>
<p>The long sessions and short breaks leave little time for senators to interact with their staff, let alone confer with each other, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., told reporters last Thursday.</p>
<p>“When we’re in that chamber, everyone is for the most part, with the exception of rare interactions, people are quiet and listening,” Mr. Casey said.&nbsp;“I think it our obligation to sit and listen every minute.”</p>
<p>Throughout the day, reporters rushed from the gallery seating, where they took notes on U.S. Senate stationery, back to the gallery’s crowded workspace to continually update stories online. While many reporters have assigned desks, some crammed themselves onto communal sofas and into phone booths — a relic that gallery reporters use for privacy.</p>

<p>Trash cans overflowed with coffee cups and scraps from the Senate Carry-Out in the basement.</p>
<p>A sampling of the Senate floor’s so-called “candy desk,” currently manned by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., were brought to the gallery at the start of the trial. Provisions brought by Mr. Toomey’s staff included Hershey's bars, Rolo caramels, Milky Ways and 3 Musketeers bars.</p>
<p>In a television interview last Thursday, Mr. Toomey explained he chose to sit at the “candy desk,” which is closest to the doors used by most senators to enter the floor.</p>
<p>“Pennsylvania is the confectionary capital of America,” Mr. Toomey explained in a television interview last week.</p>
<p>“We’ve kept it very well stocked,” he said. “It is a popular stopping-off place.&nbsp;It’s of course available to all senators, irrespective of party.”</p>
<p>The debates carried on well into the evening, as North Capitol Street clogged with traffic below the gallery’s windows.&nbsp;Outside the Capitol, a fleet of black SUVs idled in the cold, waiting to whisk away the senators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At its core, the impeachment proceeding was like any other trial: long hours demanding focus, a blend of memorable lines, key testimony and evidence, perhaps an interruption every now and then.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, an anti-abortion protester, well-known on Capitol Hill,&nbsp;&nbsp;the proceedings from the public gallery on Wednesday, shouting that Sen. Chuck “Schumer is the devil!” as he was escorted out by police.</p>
<p>The twists and turns of the trial will continue this week. And reporters will continue to be there to bring it to the American public.</p>
