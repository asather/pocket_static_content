<h1>Community shows division on fate of Columbus statue in Schenley Park</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Art Commission on Thursday heard from members of the public as a decision looms on the future of the Christopher Columbus statue in Schenley Park.</p>
<p>Testimony from the community showed a rift in opinion on whether the statue should remain in place, be altered or removed just a week before the commission could make a determination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The massive statue sculpted by Frank Vittor has stood overlooking Oakland since 1958, but the social justice movements during the summer of 2020 launched an effort to have the sculpture removed from its prominent spot next to Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who want the statue removed point to historical records, including Columbus’ own journal, that show he colonized the New World through the exploitation, enslavement and killing of indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>“He personally was instrumental in some of the most heinous acts against indigenous people,” Miguel Sague, of the Council of Three Rivers American Indian Center, told the commission. “There is a source of confusion among a lot of people nowadays because they think he just discovered America and the people that came after him were the ones that committed the atrocities. That’s just not true.”</p>
<p>Proponents of keeping the statue as is, however, say Columbus is an important symbol of acceptance of Italian Americans into the fabric of the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Columbus became a source of pride to those of Italian heritage in America in the early 20th century when anti-Italian and anti-Catholic sentiment plagued the country. Columbus, hailed as the&nbsp;“discoverer of America,” was viewed as an Italian explorer who played a significant role in forming what later became the United States.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“To Italian Americans, the Columbus statue is a symbol of hope and acceptance, a symbol of cultural pride and a symbol of the contribution of all immigrants to Pittsburgh’s rich history,” said Basil Russo, national president of the Pittsburgh-based Italian Sons and Daughters of America. “So understanding that, how do you explain rejecting one group’s symbol of hope, acceptance and pride simply to appease the demands of another group?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The meeting was set aside for public comment on the statue, and none of the commissioners shared thoughts on the matter.&nbsp;The commission will meet at 2 p.m. Wednesday to hear more testimony, deliberate and decide the statue’s fate.</p>
<p>Slippery Rock Mayor Jondavid Longo, who said he has deep Pittsburgh ties, said the removal of the statue would be a “smiling nod” to a time when it was acceptable to hurl racial epithets at Italians and Catholics. He said that Slippery Rock would gladly take the statue if the commission decides to remove it.</p>
<p>“In removing that statue, you will be denying generations of sacrifices made by Italians to prove our place as dignified and worthy equals to our American countrymen,” Mr. Longo said.&nbsp;“I ask, please, for your consideration on the harm you’ll do to the dignity of Italians and Americans of Italian descent in the Pittsburgh area should you choose to remove this statue.”</p>
<p>But Erin Angeli, a pastoral figure at The Commonwealth of Oakland church, said that as an Italian American she was ashamed of Columbus’ legacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said the city could select another Italian or Italian American who is worth celebrating more than Columbus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I suggest my fellow Italian Americans and Christians find a different figure to glorify that isn’t so embarrassing and is more inclusive to all of us who reside in this city,” she said. “I understand the desire to be remembered and to be honored. I understand the desire to honor who I have come from. I think that there is a way that we can accomplish this that is not divisive or harmful to everyone who has resided in this land and not just those of us who came later on.”</p>
