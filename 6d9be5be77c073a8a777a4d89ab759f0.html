<h1>Local Democrats push for wider safety net, want state to ‘re-imagine’ policies quickly</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Asserting that COVID-19 illuminated many of the existing problems facing working-class families and Black and brown communities in Pennsylvania, Democrats in the state Legislature say it’s not enough to rebuild a post-pandemic economy that borrows broken elements from the past.</p>
<p>Instead, they want to “re-imagine” the social safety net and fight for policies that they say will spread wealth to those who needed it most before the pandemic —&nbsp;and need it even more right now.</p>
<p>In remarks this past week, several members of Allegheny County’s Democratic caucus said they’re united across both legislative chambers under a common vision: that now is not the time to resort back to the status quo, but to fight for proposals that increase the minimum wage, mandate paid sick leave and ensure that front-line workers have access to health care, housing and education, among others.</p>

<p>“We cannot simply reopen these doors to our economy, to repair our economy, without making certain that we look at the things that occurred — the situations and conditions that were present — prior to us shutting down,” said Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Forest Hills.</p>
<p>The Democratic caucus already had introduced some of those proposals before the pandemic shut down large swaths of the economy, but state Rep. Austin Davis, D-McKeesport, said the last three months have reaffirmed their necessity.</p>
<p>Specifically, Mr. Davis cited the need to remove barriers that prevent workers from forming unions, deeming that a helpful step toward empowering them to negotiate for better wages, workplace safety, benefits and paid family leave and sick days — things that essential workers will need urgently when the pandemic ends.</p>
<p>“We have the power now more than ever to do things to change this and improve the quality of life for many working class Pennsylvanians,” Mr. Davis said.</p>
<p>In particular, caucus members pointed to the urgency around addressing systemic inequality in black and brown communities.</p>
<p>Rep. Summer Lee, D-Swissvale, said the pandemic has underscored socioeconomic differences and systemic racism — inequities that have led, in many ways, to recent rallies and protests across the globe, and which has exacerbated the impact of COVID-19 on black and brown people.</p>
<p>Ms. Lee said part of the recovery should include the passage of bills on police reform, including ones that would implement a database to track police misconduct and equip departments with the tools they need to&nbsp;“make their hiring decisions holistically.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Addressing disparities in a black community that has been hit medically and financially, Ms. Lee said, will help in the economic recovery and will help “create a society where we no longer ... expect black and brown communities to be over-policed and over-incarcerated.”</p>
<p>Rep. Ed Gainey,&nbsp;D-Lincoln-Lemington, said&nbsp;it will be important, moving forward, to offer support and resources to black businesses and to those who were on the front lines of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Every 50 or 60 years, America goes through ... a rebuilding period, and we’re here again,” Mr. Gainey said, “and we need to get this one right. And as a state, we need to talk about what our [Pennsylvania] economy is going to look like for the next 50 years.”</p>
