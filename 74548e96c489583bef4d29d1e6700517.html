<h1>Lawsuit: Jail nurse told to change hair color or be fired</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former nurse at the Allegheny County Jail says supervisors told her to change her hair color or be fired, according to a federal discrimination lawsuit filed this week.</p>
<p>Angela Sisko, 41, of West Mifflin filed the lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. She was hired in 2017 with&nbsp;“naturally appearing” red hair, but was told in early 2020 she would be removed from the schedule if she did not change her hair color, the complaint says.</p>
<p>Amie Downs, spokesperson for Allegheny County, said the county does not comment on pending litigation as a matter of policy.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, the jail healthcare services department’s policy states:&nbsp;“Hair should be kept clean, neatly trimmed and groomed” and “shall consist of only natural hair colors. Extreme or fad type of artificial hair colors (purple, pink, green, magenta etc.) are prohibited.”</p>
<p>The complaint alleges this policy was not equally carried out, as men without&nbsp;“clean, trimmed or groomed hair were not disciplined or removed from the schedule.”</p>
<p>In February, Ms. Sisko reached out to Chief Deputy Warden Laura Williams about the policy. She wrote in an email,&nbsp;“I have had this hair color for 6 years now and was hired with this hair color 3 years ago. I do not find it appropriate for someone to demand me to change something that has been accepted my entire employment at ACJ.”</p>
<p>In response, Chief Deputy Williams wrote, “I understand that you were hired with this hair color and these circumstances are frustrating to you.”</p>
<p>She continued that “multiple staff” were identified after it became clear that the policy was not being enforced, and that such conversations about the policies were happening in multiple departments.&nbsp;“This is not harassment to you.”</p>
<p>“I am unsure how you or any other person in administration are able to determine what is a natural state of red,” Ms. Sisko replied.&nbsp;“There are people working here with shades of blond that are clearly not natural.”</p>
<p>She also pointed out that she does not believe people are&nbsp;“born with brown hair with blond highlights,” and alleges another co-worker has&nbsp;“almost the same hair color” but&nbsp;“nothing is being said to her.”</p>
<p>“Had I known that the jail reserved the right to tell me that I have to change my appearance in order to maintain employment, I would have never accepted this job,” Ms. Sisko wrote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the suit, Ms. Sisko demands a jury trial.</p>
