<h1>City's bike lane master plan proposes bringing connected bike lanes, trails to just over 220 miles</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The city of Pittsburgh on Thursday released a draft of its new bike master plan, which envisions adding 120 miles of bike lanes to the city streets and 32 miles of trails.</p>
<p>About 30 miles of on-street lanes and 44 miles of trail already exist within city limits, according to the draft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plan, dubbed “Bike(+)”, includes consideration of lightweight, low-speed options, including scooters and electric bicycles, and aims to close existing gaps in the network, according to the <a href="https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/8470_Pittsburgh_Bike+_Plan_DRAFT_02_06_2020.pdf" target="_blank">71-page document</a>.</p>
<p>“The Bike(+) Plan is safety, plus access, plus sustainability, plus joyful travel,” said Mayor Bill Peduto in a press release. “It is another building block in strengthening an inclusive, vibrant, resilient city providing travel options that accommodate and respect the great diversity and needs of our people.”</p>
<p>The 10-year phased plan would prioritize a&nbsp;“spine” network, first connecting existing bicycle through-ways and addressing street projects that are already in the pipeline, according to the document.</p>
<p>No budget figures are included in the draft, but the city’s&nbsp;2020 capital budget outlines nearly $18 million to be dedicated to street improvements, $3.4 million of which is specifically devoted to bicycle infrastructure.</p>
<p>Several pages of the draft are devoted to guiding principles, including a&nbsp;“Vision Zero” approach “that we can eliminate all traffic fatalities by recognizing that people will sometimes make mistakes while driving or traveling on the road,” the plan reads. “Therefore street design and operations must be crafted to ensure those inevitable mistakes do not result in fatalities.”</p>
<p>The five-year lead-up to the master plan included several public meetings and feedback from residents and advocacy groups.</p>
<p>“This plan isn’t just for people who ride bikes. It’s for everyone who uses our streets,” said&nbsp;Scott Bricker, executive director of BikePGH.&nbsp;“It’s going to be less stressful for people driving cars because it will be well defined for where people outside of cars should be.”</p>
<p>The city’s last comprehensive bike plan was published in 1999.</p>
<p>Under Mayor Luke Raventstahl, the city designated just over 25 miles of roadway as bike lanes or sharrows, though none of them were protected from traffic. Mr. Peduto’s administration&nbsp;has installed 13.67 miles of bike lanes and “sharrows” — shared portions of the road between bikes and vehicles indicated by street markings — according to BikePGH figures. Just under 5 miles of that are protected bike lanes. Despite the difference in figures under the two mayors, critics have called Mr. Peduto&nbsp;“bike lane Billy.”</p>
<p>The city is seeking public comment on the draft until the end of March and is asking residents and stakeholders to share feedback at bikeped@pittsburghpa.gov.</p>
<p>The public is invited to attend several open house meetings:</p>
