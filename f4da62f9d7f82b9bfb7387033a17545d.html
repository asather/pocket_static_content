<h1>Pitt sets up 179 isolation beds if needed to isolate students with COVID-19 this fall</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh has established 179 isolation beds across campus for students this fall who are infected or suspected of having COVID-19,`officials said Thursday, detailing precautions stretching from student affairs to facilities to the medical school.</p>
<p>Classes, at least on the main campus, are likely to begin remotely Aug. 19, then transition to a mix of in-person and online delivery once the university is cleared to move to its “guarded status,” the least stringent of <a href="https://www.pittwire.pitt.edu/news/get-know-pitt-s-operational-postures" target="_blank">three general categories Pitt will use</a> based on COVID-19 risk to set the level of face-to-face education allowable.</p>

<p>Students moving into Pitt residence halls, off-campus apartments and $22 million in hotel rooms purchased by Pitt in Oakland to cut dorm occupancies will be asked to quarantine seven days before and after they arrive.</p>
<p>Rather than mass testing of arriving students, systematic randomized tests will be used by Pitt to determine baseline prevalence of the virus among students from this region, other states and if they are living on and off campus, said John Williams, chief of Pitt’s COVID-19 Medical Response Office and chief of the medical school’s division of infectious diseases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pitt’s midday briefing comes as other schools have been wrestling with details as fall is approaching. Penn State Univeristy officials were expected Thursday to provide more detail on their testing plans.</p>
<p>At Pitt, officials said no single data point will drive any decision this fall on changing between in-person and online classes, or whether the university might conclude it could not longer operate its campus with nearly 29,000 students, plus another 5,000 on its four branches.</p>
<p>“There is no hard and fast number. There are a lot of data points that we are looking at and will continue to look at — number of tests,&nbsp;&nbsp;number of students in isolation, number of students in quarantine, changes in the rates,” Dr. Williams said.</p>
<p>Plus, events off campus, including the virus trends in Allegheny County, will play a role.</p>
<p>Officials did not identify which buildings will house the isolation beds, but said students will get support from a range of offices from student affairs to health professionals. Another 20 beds can be added if necessary.</p>
<p>The university, while it can not force students to stay in isolation, is articulating what is expected and failure to comply could mean disciplinary action under a newly revised code of student conduct, said Kenyon Bonner, vice provost and dean of students.. The same is true for those who put others at risk in such ways as refusing to wear masks while on campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sanctions&nbsp;“would range anywhere from education, all the way up to disciplinary suspension or dismissal form the university,” he said via Zoom call with other university administrators.</p>
<p>Dr. Williams said medical organizations including the collegiate health association and federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say mass testing is not recommended, for reasons including rates of false negatives since a single test is just a snap shot. “It doesn’t mean they are not infected,” he said.</p>
<p>He and officials at other universities have also pointed to a lack of available testing and said establishing instead a baseline prevalence and using that to make decisions about student safety on campus is more useful.</p>
<p>In recent days, a number of private and public campuses, including five of Pennsylvania’s 14 state-owned universities have switched fall semester largely online given a surge in COVID-19 cases in various states. About 150,000 Americans have died from the virus.</p>
<p>One school, Edinboro University, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/07/28/Edinboro-WVU-Pitt-Penn-State-COVID-19-West-Chester-fall-online-universities-pandemic/stories/202007270074" target="_blank">said in explaining its shift in fall plans</a>&nbsp;that young people were becoming infected in larger numbers, including college athletes on various campuses this summer, and there was a testing shortage, his administration said. Adding to fears was the June 30 death of Juan Garcia, 21, a Penn State senior from Allentown, who had fallen ill with the virus living off campus in State College.</p>
<p>Though its campus is still weeks away from fall move-in, and largely shuttered, 25 students and 14 faculty have tested positive for the virus at the University of Pittsburgh in just over a month, according to data there as of last week.</p>
