<h1>Josh Bell on staying in Pittsburgh, a new diet and fielding better</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">There was no apparent haggling from Josh Bell’s camp two weeks ago when the Pirates <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/10/pirates-arbitration-updates-2020-jameson-taillon-josh-bell/stories/202001100118" target="_blank">somewhat quietly signed</a> all eight of their arbitration-eligible players, the first baseman included for $4.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Bell had his agent, Scott Boras, handle the details while continuing to focus on working out, with the instructions to let him know if anything was especially nuts.</span></p>
<p>Ignoring the outside noise and focusing only on what’s directly in front of him is a lesson Bell learned last year around this time, when a scout’s (laughably wrong) take in a Sports Illustrated preview edition ripped him apart, and Bell wound up having a breakout season.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">So, with questions about whether Bell will be here in a couple years or whether he’ll wind up like many others — getting paid a lot of money by a big-market club — the 27-year-old Texan, predictably, isn’t thinking about any of that.</span></p>
<p>“Shoot,” Bell said with a smile after delivering doughnuts and coffee to the McDonald Volunteer Fire Department as part of the Pirates CARE-a-van on Thursday morning. “This time last year, I was worried about even having a spot after the [2018] I had. But I do hear that narrative. I’m always like, ‘OK, I’m trying to go one game at a time.’</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“This game’s crazy. A lot of players don’t make it to free agency. Right now I’m just trying to make it through the season, stay healthy, do what I have to do to stay on the field. Three years down the line, I don’t know what’s going to happen. But I just want to be able to still be able to wear a jersey.”</span></p>
<p>There’s a very good chance of that happening; the only question is which team’s jersey it will be. And whether Bell, who is under team control for two more seasons, is seen in the field.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Right now, many around the game have him ticketed for American League duty as a designated hitter, the result of his 13 errors at first base last season; only San Diego’s Eric Hosmer (14) made more. </span></p>
<p><span>The DH coming to the National League would probably open some additional doors, too.&nbsp;</span>But so would Bell improving his defense, which isn’t necessary because of a lack of effort. Bell works at it. A lot. The results just aren’t reflective of that.</p>
<p>This offseason, Bell said he spent considerable time working on his defense while training in Newport Beach, Calif., his normal offseason home. There, he took grounders with Oakland’s Matt Chapman — a two-time Gold Glove award winner and one of the best defensive infielders in baseball — as well as Yankees utility man Tyler Wade.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I tried to learn from them,” Bell said. “I feel like I’ve picked up a couple of things that hopefully I can take from them and be better on the defensive side this year.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Another thing that Bell changed this offseason was his diet, scaling back how much he eats meat. Bell has been eating more seitan, something introduced to him by Pirate clubhouse chef Tony Palatucci, and Bell said he’s noticed a big difference. Bell said they actually got the idea from watching “The Game Changers” on Netflix and decided to give it a shot.</span></p>
<p>“I’m not a full-fledged vegetarian or anything like that,” Bell said. “But I’m going to try and keep it up during the season. I think I’ve had meat twice this year. I’m just trying to save it for special occasions and not make it a routine, try to get my nutrients from vegetables for the most part. I’m trying to stick with that. It’s going well so far.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Bell actually stayed in Pittsburgh after the season ended, which allowed his groin injury to heal. He used that opportunity to feel more at home in the city, something that doesn’t always happen during the grind of a season.</span></p>
<p>Events like the ones the Pirates are doing now — the CARE-a-van stuff — are fun for Bell, who appeared at ease while joking with firefighters, chatting with them about specific games and plays from this past season and making sure everyone got enough pictures and autographs.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“It’s good to be back, for sure,” Bell said. “Got a really good taste of Pittsburgh away from the game at the beginning of the offseason, staying here and healing up. It’s good to be back after a couple months and meeting new coaches. Coming out in the community, giving back and shaking hands. Sharing smiles. Sharing stories. It’s a lot of fun.”</span></p>
