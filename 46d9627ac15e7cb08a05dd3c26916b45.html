<p>WASHINGTON — The Congressional panel tasked with overseeing at least $2.8 trillion in COVID-19 economic rescue spending has tapped as a top adviser David Hickton, a University of Pittsburgh policy researcher and former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the school announced Friday.</p>
<p>Mr. Hickton, the founding director of the University of Pittsburgh Institute for Cyber Law, Policy and Security, is taking a leave of absence from the school to serve as staff director and senior counsel to the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Hickton will advise the Democratically-led panel, chaired by Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., as it examines how federal dollars flow from the Trump administration to families, businesses, health care institutions and the broader economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“I have watched and admired the principled leadership of Chairman Clyburn for many years,” Mr. Hickton said in a statement released by the school. “When he offered me the opportunity to help do this important work for the American people, I could not say no.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hickton was not immediately available for an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Hickton arrives just as the subcommittee — a&nbsp;panel under the auspices of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform —&nbsp;begins to ramp up its efforts about three weeks after it was established.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The resolution formally establishing the subcommittee passed on April 23 by a vote of 212-182 along party lines, with Rep. Justin Amash, I-Mich., voting with Republicans in opposition.</p>
<p>That vote&nbsp;occurred the same day lawmakers approved another $310 billion for the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which provides forgivable loans to small businesses and has been rife with oversight issues. Several large, publicly traded companies were approved for the small business loans, potentially crowding out mom-and-pop shops.</p>
<p>Last week, the panel's first official action was to call out five large publicly traded firms, including a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/05/11/Lawmakers-demand-Universal-Stainless-other-public-companies-return-small-business-loans/stories/202005110058?cid=search" target="_blank">steel company near Pittsburgh</a>, for taking small business loan money. The panel has demanded Universal Stainless &amp; Alloy Products to return its $10 million loan, approved by the PNC Financial Services Group, or hand over its loan application documents.</p>
<p>The panel announced one of the five companies, Georgia-based biopharmaceutical firm MiMedx Group, has returned the loan. An aide to the subcommittee said Friday it was “continuing to work with the companies to hear their perspective and review materials.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hickton spent six years as a U.S. attorney, co-chairing a national Heroin Task Force to address the opioid epidemic and bringing&nbsp;an high-profile indictment against the Chinese People's Liberation Army for economic espionage against four Pittsburgh-area companies.</p>
<p>As head of Pitt Cyber, Mr. Hickton has explored subjects like election security and Russian hacking.</p>
<p>Mr. Clyburn,&nbsp;in a statement released by his office, said&nbsp;Mr. Hickton’s record as a U.S. attorney&nbsp;“demonstrates some unique abilities to identify and weed out fraud and abuse.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hickton will “help protect the extraordinary and unprecedented outlay of taxpayer money as Congress continues to fight this pandemic and its economic consequences.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hickton’s role will be to oversee the professional staff and operations, an aide to Mr. Clyburn said.</p>
<p>Pitt announced Beth Schwanke, executive director of Pitt Cyber, will lead the institute in Mr. Hickton’s absence. She has served in that role since 2017, the year Pitt Cyber was established.</p>
<p>Pitt Chancellor Patrick Gallagher praised Mr. Hickton as the “consummate public servant” with an “unyielding commitment to integrity, collaboration and ingenuity.”</p>
