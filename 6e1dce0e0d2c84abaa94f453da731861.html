<h1>Churches altering communion practices in the wake of a pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With several area Eastern Orthodox churches now holding public services with small congregations, the servers are providing both the bread and wine of communion to parishioners — but&nbsp;without anyone touching their lips to a shared vessel.</p>
<p>With local Roman Catholic churches reopening at the start of June, they’ll be offering the bread but not the wine so as to avoid the traditional use of a common cup.</p>
<p>With local Episcopal churches preparing for eventual reopenings, they also don’t plan to offer a common cup.</p>
<p>These are just some of churches’ liturgical responses, at least for the near future, as Pennsylvania counties increasingly adapt to “yellow” status, opening up with caution amid the easing of pandemic-related shutdowns.</p>
<p>While churches of all types have some variation of a communion service — also known as the Eucharist or the Lord’s Supper — the ritual is central and essential to liturgical churches with ancient roots. They teach that when the priest consecrates the bread and wine, these elements become in some mystical sense the body and blood of Jesus.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>And because these churches also normally use a common vessel to serve the wine, they’re all taking precautions to make sure the rite doesn’t also spread the coronavirus among the faithful. For several weeks now, priests have presided at services streamed online, but with only a small core of assistants in attendance.</p>
<p>(Other types of churches often use individual cups, though health experts note servers need to take precautions so these, too, aren’t contaminated as they are prepared and served.)</p>
<p>In the Roman Catholic dioceses of Pittsburgh and Greensburg, communion will be provided in the form of the bread wafer only when Masses resume June 1. (The normal obligation to attend weekend Mass remains waived for now.)</p>
<p>“The Precious Blood is not to be distributed to the faithful,” says a lengthy guideline published by the Pittsburgh diocese.</p>
<p>In fact, that’s how it was typically done at Catholic Masses for several centuries until recent decades, when the sharing of the cup became common again.</p>
<p>“In Catholic theology, both the bread and the wine becomes the presence of Christ at Mass,” Bishop David Zubik said.&nbsp;“The sharing of the blood of Christ in the cup has always been an option, so while the majority of parishes do share at least at Sunday Masses, it’s not something you have to do.”</p>
<p>The sharing of the bread itself poses its own questions. Guidelines from the diocese say the priest should not wear gloves when distributing the communion, but rather have sanitizer nearby in case his hand touches the person receiving the communion. Also, Catholics who prefer to receive communion directly on the tongue, a traditional practice still favored by some, can do so.</p>
<p>Bishop Zubik said he encourages the faithful to receive by hand, but he left the other option open because of its importance to some.</p>
<p>“It is a very sacred moment, because we are receiving the very body and blood of Christ,” Bishop Zubik said. “While some bishops in the country said you can only receive in the hand, that’s not the position I’ve taken.”</p>
<p>The distribution of communion is just one of dozens of considerations for these and other churches. Bishops and denominations are publishing lengthy guidelines on all sorts of factors —&nbsp;limiting attendance, requiring masks, arranging for socially distant seating, ensuring a no-contact passing of the peace, distributing hand sanitizer, disinfecting doorknobs, even curbing the<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/faith-religion/2020/05/15/How-can-worshippers-keep-from-singing-They-may-have-to/stories/202005120043" target="_blank">&nbsp;amount of singing</a>.</p>
<p>Local Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions, several of whose churches opened this past weekend or the previous one with limited attendance, have their own plans.</p>
<p>Unlike Catholic churches, the Orthodox do not typically serve a common cup directly to the faithful. Rather, the priest breaks the bread into small pieces, combines them with the wine in the chalice and serves the mixture&nbsp;with a spoon.</p>
<p>In Greek Orthodox churches in the Metropolis of Pittsburgh, worshipers will be asked to receive the sacrament by tilting their head back so the server can pour the sacrament into the mouth without the spoon touching the mouth, a common practice in parts of the Orthodox world.</p>
<p>In the local parishes of the Orthodox Church in America, the clergy are using individual spoons for each communicant. The spoons are either metal — and sterilized afterward — or wood, in which case they are burned afterward as a reverent way of disposing items that have touched the sacrament.</p>
<p>Archbishop Melchisedek Pleska, of the OCA’s Archdiocese of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, noted the traditional practice before communion is to add boiling water to the wine, whose alcohol content further can act as a disinfectant. “So you’ve got a metal chalice, you’ve got wine with the alcohol, then boiling water on top of that, so we feel fairly safe,” he said.</p>
<p>In these and other churches, the guidelines call for communion servers to wear masks.</p>
<p>Under guidelines posted by the Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh, which uses much of the same rite as Orthodox churches, priests and deacons will use a common spoon in distributing communion, but instruct parishioners not to make physical contact with it. If there is contact, the spoon is to be disinfected before being used again.</p>
<p>Bishop Dorsey McConnell of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh said rather than prescribe an opening date, he’s urging parishes to make sure they first have plans for safely reopening. The diocese has posted guidelines that say the common chalice should not be used.</p>
<p>“We are all yearning to gather again face-to-face, in person and not only on a screen,” he wrote in a letter to Episcopalians. “However, we need to ensure that we can do so safely.”</p>
<p>In the Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh, Bishop Jim Hobby&nbsp;has not set a policy on the common cup but has provided guidelines and is asking pastors to use their best judgment on these and other matters when deciding to reopen.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the Southwestern Pennsylvania Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, “We have not provided specific instructions regarding the distribution of the sacrament, but rather suggested that it may be best to gather first for non-sacramental worship,” said Bishop Kurt Kusserow.</p>
<p>Archbishop Melchisedek said some parishioners have wanted the churches to open sooner.</p>
<p>“I’ve had any number of people in various parts of the diocese who have protested the limitations,” the archbishop said. “They didn’t see why they churches were closed to begin with. But we’ve tried to follow the governmental regulations because it’s the safe thing to do.”</p>
<p>He noted that with online worship and other activities,&nbsp;“the&nbsp;church has been available one way or another. The only thing that hasn’t been available is the sacrament itself. That will be made more available.”</p>
