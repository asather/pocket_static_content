<h1>Ex-caretaker at Beaver County special needs facility pleads guilty in abuse case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former caretaker charged with abusing residents of a Beaver County special needs facility pleaded guilty Wednesday to dozens of counts.</p>
<p>Zachary Dinell, 26, of Freedom will be sentenced April 30 in Beaver County Common Pleas Court.</p>
<p>Beaver County District Attorney David Lozier said the defendant pleaded guilty to 29 counts and is facing a maximum sentence of 105 years in prison for crimes committed against residents of McGuire Memorial in Daugherty.</p>
<p>Mr. Dinell, who was fired when the accusations came to light, was accused of assaulting residents and taking photos and videos of nude patients â€” including some juveniles. The charges filed against him included aggravated assault, neglect of a care-dependent person, endangering the welfare of children and recklessly endangering another person.</p>
<p>McGuire Memorial, a ministry of the Felician Sisters of North America, has served people with physical and developmental disabilities since 1963 in Beaver County.</p>
<p>A second defendant, Tyler Smith, 29, was charged with simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and endangering the welfare of children. His case is still working its way through court.</p>
<p>In November, several family members of current or former residents sued the facility and Mr. Dinell in Beaver County Common Pleas Court. Mr. Smith was also named as a defendant in one of the cases.</p>
