<h1>'We're still in shock': Family, friends of slain N. Huntingdon chiropractor offering reward for information</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Family of North Huntingdon chiropractor David Bailey — who was killed in his office in November — are offering a reward for information about his death, according to the family’s attorney Daniel P. Beisler.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s been six months and we haven’t seen any arrests,” Mr. Beisler said Wednesday afternoon. “So friends and family thought why don’t we offer a reward.&nbsp;The police have advised that they’re still waiting on results of DNA tests, but its just been taking so long. We realize an investigation takes time, especially when someone has been murdered, but we thought this would help move things along.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>For two weeks now billboards that show a photo of Mr. Bailey, as well as details requesting information and a reward have been placed on Route 30 in North Versailles, and near the Pennsylvania Turnpike entrance in Irwin, Mr. Beisler said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He would not disclose the reward&nbsp; amount.</p>
<p>Mr. Bailey’s body was found the day after Thanksgiving by an employee around 8:20 a.m. in the offices of Bailey Family Chiropractic in the 11000 block of Parkway Drive, authorities said.</p>
<p>Police would not say where the body was found, nor if there were any signs of forced entry to the clinic, but they did say investigators believe Mr. Bailey was killed in his office. The North Huntingdon Township Police Department could not be reached for an update in the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Beisler on Wednesday said the chiropractor was slain with a knife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re hoping that someone has some info on why this happened, and that maybe the perpetrator’s friends or family might want to do the right thing and put this family’s mind at ease,” Mr. Beisler said. “The family, three sons, a wife and a daughter-in-law, are&nbsp;frustrated and they’re living with this everyday.”</p>
<p>The attorney said he knew Mr. Bailey personally —&nbsp;his clinic was right across the street from his attorney offices in the township, and Mr. Bailey’s family lived in Mr. Beisler’s neighborhood until a couple years ago, he said. The slain doctor’s sons also grew up with Mr. Beisler’s daughter, he added.</p>
<p>“I do take it personally, and I’m hoping that we can help the family ... we’re still in shock,” Mr. Beisler said.&nbsp;</p>
