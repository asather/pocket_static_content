<h1>Josh Hough, Shileak Livingston power No. 1 Beaver Falls on Senior Night</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It wasn’t the video game-like performance fans have grown accustomed to from Beaver Falls’ two-headed monster in the backfield, but it was plenty good enough to send a message to the rest of Class 2A.</p>
<p>Going into Friday night’s rivalry game against No. 4 New Brighton, Tigers senior running backs Josh Hough and Shileak Livingston had each run for more than 100 yards in five of their last six games. And although neither one cracked the century mark Friday night, the duo combined for 144 yards and three scores to help guide No. 1 Beaver Falls (4-0, 4-0) to a 44-15 win on Senior Night at Geneva College to reclaim the Little Brown Jug.</p>
<p>“They don’t let you forget about it,” Tigers coach Nick Nardone said about losing the cross-river rivalry matchup the last time the teams met in 2017. “We’ve been itching to get a chance to play them for it again, and we did what we had to do to make sure they realized who we are and what Beaver Falls is about.”</p>
<p>Hough ran for 86 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries while also adding a two-point conversion, and Livingston carried the ball 15 times for 58 yards and two touchdowns to go along with three two-point conversions. Sophomore quarterback Jaren Brickner completed 5-of-14 passes for 181 yards and a touchdown with two interceptions in the win.</p>
<p>“We lost the jug a couple years ago to them, but now we finally got it back, and we’re happy and we’re ready to move on,” Livingston said. “It’s a really good way to end Senior Night.”</p>
<p>New Brighton (3-1, 3-1) couldn’t have asked for a better start to the game, as the Lions’ defense tackled Livingston in the backfield for a 5-yard loss on the game’s first play then forced and recovered a fumble by Brickner two plays later. New Brighton took over at its own 38-yard line, and junior quarterback Gabe Haddox hit senior wide receiver Xavier Reynolds for a 36-yard scoring strike on third-and-8 to open up the scoring.</p>
<p>The Tigers responded with an impressive scoring drive, capped off by a 1-yard touchdown plunge by Livingston after a 40-yard hookup from Brickner to junior wide receiver Mekhi Clark. The extra point was blocked, though, leaving the Lions on top, 7-6 — but not for long.</p>
<p>After a physical first quarter in which both teams had their moments, the second quarter was all Beaver Falls. First, Hough put the Tigers on top with a 45-yard touchdown run down the right sideline. On the very next play, senior Tyler Jones intercepted Haddox and returned it 30 yards for a touchdown. Livingston followed both scores with successful two-point conversion runs to give Beaver Falls a 22-7 lead.</p>
<p>The Tigers defense then forced a three-and-out by New Brighton, and Livingston and Hough took turns pounding the ball down the field before Livingston capped off the drive with his second score of the game, this one from 3 yards out. Hough ran in the two-point conversion, and Beaver Falls took a 30-7 lead into the break.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of good players on our team on offense and defense,” Hough said. “They showed out, and we all showed out.”</p>
<p>The Lions appeared to receive a spark from Jameson Ahmed when the 6-foot-4 wide receiver made a contested 58-yard touchdown catch, but Ahmed was called for pass interference on the play. On the next play, Tigers junior Quadir Thomas intercepted Haddox and returned it for a 33-yard pick-six, giving Beaver Falls a 38-7 lead.</p>
<p>After another defensive stop by the Tigers, Brickner connected with junior tight end Tyler Cain for a 34-yard touchdown pass to stretch Beaver Falls’ lead to 44-7. Nardone then pulled his starters in the fourth quarter as New Brighton added a late 1-yard touchdown run by Kevin Williams, but the game had long since been decided.</p>
<p>With the win, the Tigers move into sole possession of first place in the Midwestern Conference.</p>
<p>“We’re preparing for a championship run, so we have to prepare every week to just get better at what we do, improve at what we do, and fine-tune all the mistakes,” Nardone said.</p>
