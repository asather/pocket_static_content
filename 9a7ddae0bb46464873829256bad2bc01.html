<h1>Obama Academy beats Penn Hills, earns first-ever PIAA playoff victory</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sean Snead knocked down a long-range shot and quickly threw his hand in the air, index finger extended as he looked toward the Obama Academy cheering section.</p>
<p>The shot was worth 3 points and came at a key moment, but the one he flashed to the crowd was significant, too.</p>
<p>This was another first for Obama.</p>
<p>Snead scored 25 points to lead Obama to a 73-63 win against Penn Hills in a PIAA Class 5A first-round game in front of a raucous crowd Friday at Brashear High School.</p>
<p>A few weeks after winning its first City League championship, Obama (16-8) now has its first PIAA playoff win. The Eagles advance to the second round to play District 3 runner-up Milton Hershey (21-4), a 78-74 winner against Chartiers Valley.</p>
<p>“It’s big because we’re making history,” said Snead, a senior guard who connected on five 3-pointers. “This is our first time going into the second round. We’re still making history. Like winning our first City championship. It feels great.”</p>
<p>Dashon Cruse chipped in 16 points and Sayon Bennett 10 for the Eagles, who needed to win a subregional game to advance to the main draw. Once there, the Eagles forced 25 turnovers and scored more points against Penn Hills than any team had all season.</p>
<p>It was the second loss in a row for Penn Hills (18-6), which as the No. 1 seed in the WPIAL playoffs lost to Laurel Highlands in the quarterfinals. This defeat added to what was a dismal night for WPIAL Class 5A teams, as all six were eliminated.</p>
<p>Wes Kropp led Penn Hills with 19 points (he was 9 of 11 from the field) and Kyree Mitchell added 16. Kropp’s final 2 came on a basket with 3:10 left that cut Obama’s lead to 59-58. Kropp was fouled on the play, but was unable to tie the score because Penn Hills was whistled for a lane violation.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see it,” Penn Hills coach Dan DeRose said. “If we make the free throw, we would have tied the game. And things kind of tighten up a little bit when that happens. So now the kids start feeling the pressure.”</p>
<p>Pressure makes diamonds, and Snead hit a gem of a shot when he knocked down a 3-pointer from the corner to increase Obama’s lead to 62-58 with 2:45 left. Penn Hills’ Eddie McKissick made 1 of 2 free throws to trim the deficit to three, but Obama’s Bennett then stepped up, knocking down a trio of jumpers in a 6-2 run that extended his team’s lead to 68-61 with 1:10 remaining. Prior to that spurt, Bennett had only four points and was 2 of 11 from the field.</p>
<p>“Huge,” Obama coach Devas Simmons called Bennett’s clutch baskets. “But he was just missing those ones throughout the game. No matter what, that’s why I call him ‘The General.’ He takes charge of this team and keeps everybody moving. And he’s a tough defender.”</p>
<p>That defense gave Penn Hills fits. The Indians shot 51% (27 of 53) from the field, but their propensity for turning the ball over became a fatal flaw, something DeRose said plagued them the final few weeks of the season. Obama committed only 13 turnovers.</p>
<p>“That’s been this team’s deficiency — communication and collapses on defense. It came back to bite us,” DeRose said.</p>
<p>The disruption Obama caused with its defense often led directly to offense, allowing the Eagles to score frequently in transition and from close range.</p>
<p>Snead was 5 of 7 from 3-point range. One of them beat the halftime buzzer, forcing a 35-35 tie. Obama stormed out of the gates to lead, 27-15, after one quarter before Penn Hills charged back with a 20-5 run in the second before Snead’s late 3.</p>
<p>Obama now gets to experience another first — a PIAA second-round game.</p>
<p>Said Snead: “To be playing in March, I haven’t done this a lot. The last time was AAU.”</p>
