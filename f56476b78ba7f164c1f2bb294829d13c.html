<h1>Ross commissioners OK archery deer hunt contract</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bambi may have to take cover come September in Ross.</p>
<p>Commissioners on Monday approved a contract with Suburban Whitetail Management LLC to conduct an archery hunt on properties in the township. The meeting was held virtually.</p>
<p>Hunting will be done on township-owned properties, but not in the parks, and on private properties where the landowner signs up and the organization believes it can hunt safely. The hunt would occur during the state’s deer archery season, from September through January.</p>
<p>The board voted 7-1, with Patrick Mullin voting no.</p>
<p>“This has been a long road. We are very close to the end of the road this evening,” Commissioner Dan DeMarco said. “We have had problems with deer for 10 years or more.”</p>
<p>Township officials have been studying the issue for months. Last year, they passed a ban on feeding deer. They followed that with a survey, in which 62% of residents said there was a deer problem in the township.</p>
<p>Through the survey, they were able to identify areas that are experiencing the most problems with deer, Mr. DeMarco said.</p>
<p>A public meeting was held in February. “It was very clear then that the residents are frustrated with the deer population, frustrated with the damage occurring on their property,” Mr. DeMarco said.</p>
<p>In other business, commission President Steve Korbel read a statement from the township on the recent deaths of African Americans at the hands of police.</p>
<p>“These tragic losses of life and other instances of racism are completely unacceptable,” he said. “The township and the Ross Police Department want to reassure our community that our department takes our responsibility as officials and police officers seriously.”</p>
<p>In May 2019, the township approved a complete revision of the “use of force” policy, banning chokeholds, requiring de-escalation and requiring “comprehensive reporting of all ‘use of force,’” Mr. Korbel said.</p>
<p>All police cars have video cameras. A policy covering body-worn cameras was approved Monday.</p>
<p>Commissioners also approved a revision to the agreement with Northland Public Library, which includes the circulation of electronic media when computing the township’s annual fee. The fee is based on population and usage.</p>
<p>“In 1977, nobody was anticipating checking out e-books and downloading e-videos and e-magazines,” said Amy Steele, library director.</p>
<p>Commissioners also decided to have only one meeting next month — on July 20. The meeting will be held in the township building, but they will try to figure out a way to broadcast it for residents who are still leery of attending in person.</p>
