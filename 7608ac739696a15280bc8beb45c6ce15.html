<h1>Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra names new principal pops conductor</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Conductor and trumpeter Byron Stripling is the new principal conductor for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s PNC Pops series, which features popular music ranging from Disney and The Beatles to Broadway and film scores.</p>
<p>Mr. Stripling, 58, has conducted the orchestra as a guest and will make his debut as principal conductor in October. This is only the second time the orchestra has named a principal pops conductor. The first was the renowned Marvin Hamlisch, who was hired in 1995 and died in 2012. The position has since been vacant.</p>
<p>Mr. Stripling, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, is the former lead trumpeter and soloist with the Count Basie Orchestra. He has played and recorded with Dizzy Gillespie and Woody Herman, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra and the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band. He has also appeared on Broadway cast albums, film and television soundtracks and has numerous soloist credits on television programs.</p>
<p>The announcement took place Tuesday morning in the James E. Rohr Auditorium at The Tower at PNC Plaza, where Mr. Stripling spoke about the power of music and shared his vision for the position before giving a short performance, singing and playing the trumpet.</p>
<p>“We know that art is the finest form of hope,” he said. “I will use my podium as a delivery system to uplift this community.”</p>
<p>The PNC Pops series has an average attendance of 1,800 per concert, which comes to 49,137 people per year. It has 2,430 subscribers; by comparison, the BNYMellon Grand Classics series has 5,775 subscribers. Some of the series’ most popular offerings have included music from Disney, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, The Chieftains, John Williams and the annual Highmark Holiday Pops show, which earned record attendance for a third consecutive season in December.</p>
<p>As the face of the pops series, Mr. Stripling will conduct three performances the first season. He said that in addition to developing the pops series, he hopes to develop a presence in Pittsburgh’s schools and bring members of the orchestra into the community.</p>
