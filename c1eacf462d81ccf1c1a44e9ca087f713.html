<p>HARRISBURG — Evictions and foreclosures in Pennsylvania are on hold through July 10 under an executive order signed by Gov. Tom Wolf.</p>
<p>The state Supreme Court previously placed a moratorium on such proceedings until May 11, as officials shuttered much of Pennsylvania’s economy to prevent COVID-19 from overwhelming hospitals, causing unemployment to skyrocket.</p>

<p>“At a time when people need to stay home to protect their heath, they should not have to worry about losing their homes,” Mr. Wolf said in a statement Thursday. “Ensuring that people can remain in their homes will help them to better protect their loved ones. It gives families the comfort of knowing they will have a place to live while all of us work together to fight COVID-19 and prepare to move Pennsylvania forward.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf and Attorney General Josh Shapiro are expected to formally announce the order at 1 p.m.</p>
