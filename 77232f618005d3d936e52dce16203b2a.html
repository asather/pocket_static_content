<h1>COVID-19 Update: Allegheny County reports 83 new cases, no deaths</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County health department on Monday announced 83 new cases of COVID-19, making it the fourth consecutive day the county has seen an increase in the number of cases over 60. No new deaths were reported.</p>
<p>The additional cases bring the county total to 2,651, with 2,508 confirmed and 143 probable, since the pandemic started in March. The recent cases involve individuals ranging in age from 9 to 89, but the median age is 26.</p>
<p>County health director, Dr. Debra Bogen, said more people were being tested for the disease, but that the higher number of infections reflected a surge in the virus locally. A total of&nbsp;96 new cases were reported Sunday, topping the previous mark of 90 cases set the previous day.</p>
<p>“In one three-day period, we tested 1,000 people, but we’re seeing a higher positive rate because there’s a lot more COVID disease in our community than there was a few weeks ago,” Dr. Bogen said.</p>
<p>In the last 10 days, the county has had 513 new cases. In an effort to contain the virus, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/06/28/covid-19-coronavirus-allegheny-county-western-pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-32/stories/202006280096" target="_blank">county officials on Sunday announced</a> that the sale of alcohol for on-site consumption is prohibited. Though effective immediately, enforcement won’t begin until Tuesday at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Case investigators noted that multiple people who tested positive for the contagious virus had noted visiting bars in the South Side and in Oakland, as well as vacationing in Florida, Texas, along the coast of the Carolinas and other COVID-19 hot spots.</p>
<p>As of Monday, Allegheny also saw an additional four hospitalizations, bringing the total to 386 since cases were first reported.</p>
<p>The county’s death toll remains at 186. Data released by the state on Sunday had the death toll for the county at 183.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Pennsylvania Department of Health confirmed 505 additional positive cases of COVID-19, bringing the statewide total to 85,496. All 67 counties in Pennsylvania have cases of COVID-19.</p>
