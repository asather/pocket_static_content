<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 07.08.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hello, everyone. Welcome to my weekly Pirates chat. I’ll be here at noon to answer your Pirates questions, but feel free to fire away now. And thanks, as always, for participating. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, Deadheads. It’s about that time.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Do you think the prolonged and fairly nasty negotiations between MLBA and the owners this year will affect the likelihood of getting a deal done in time for the 2022 season to start normally (assuming there’s no plague going around?) On the one hand I can see each side digging their heels in and deciding to “win” the next CBA which could result in a long, long, stoppage. On the other hand I can see that the prospect of playing and making money from basically one and a third seasons in the span of three years could make everyone really committed to being reasonable, flexible, and getting a deal done in time. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Rich. I’m honestly scared about what that time will bring. I don’t think it will be good. Here’s a third way of looking at it that really concerns me: Everybody thinks it’s gonna be bad. So, what if both sides figure this is a good time to dig in their heels? But I think there’s just so much fundamental dislike here, it’s hard to be optimistic. I’m sort of hoping that perhaps Rob Manfred isn’t in place at that time, although I’m not terribly optimistic that will be the case. To me, that’s one of the only ways this could go smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>Now Batting</strong>: Who do you think winds being the 5th starter? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think it’s probably Brault’s job to lose; however, I liked the idea yesterday of him and Chad Kuhl piggybacking, meaning they essentially share a start. For two guys coming off injury, I think that makes a lot of sense. And then if they do well and somebody either stinks or gets hurt, maybe they break it apart.</p>
<p><strong>Blackhawk Bob</strong>: With the suspension of the minor league season what if any are the Pirates plans for continuing the improvement and development of their current minor leaguers. I would think that this would be a huge roadblock to the growth of the future Pirates. Especially for a team that endlessly preaches the importance of drafting and developing from within. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It hurts them, no doubt, Bob. No minor league season has a big impact on a team like the Pirates, and it’s hard to put a positive spin on it. They’re gonna do some development-type stuff in Altoona. Ben Cherington said he’s optimistic there will be something at Pirate City, too. But neither thing comes close to replicating game work. The key will be just breaking even; forget about getting better. If they can not get worse, to me, that’s a victory.</p>
<p><strong>Fish Monger</strong>: Jason, from the owner’s standpoint, playoff baseball is a profit center in ticket sales and concessions. Given that there will be none of that this year, do you think we will see a very muted trade deadline? I mean from an owner’s perspective, and without the ticket and concession revenue, what really can be gained by trading some of your farm away for no real gain, even if you do go deep into the playoffs? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Fish Monger. I’m not sure I understand the premise of your question. There will be playoff baseball this year -- theoretically. I mean, maybe not in Pittsburgh, but they will have a postseason. But I do see what you’re saying. Will the lack of fans change teams’ approach at the trade deadline? One, I don’t know for sure. Nobody does. But if I had to give some sort of answer -- which I guess is the point of these things -- then no, I don’t think it will change anybody’s approach, at least not directly. If a traditional contender has a chance to win it all, I still think they’re going to get what they think they need. Now, prices may be nuts because some teams (the Pirates could be one) may be looking to dump talent/dollars, but that’s the indirect effect I referenced. As far as “no real gain,” I don’t think teams are looking at it that way. That’s like saying they’re entire basis for winning every year it’s money. While it’s certainly a big part, it’s not everything.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Cole Tucker is a curious case. He’s a first round pick with hign <br> <strong>Ted</strong>: Cole Tucker is a curious case. First round pick with unknown upside. But how will we know the upside without at bats? He’s not getting any younger. Don’t they owe it to themselves to see what they have in him? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Agree, Ted. Guessing you sent this a little too soon, but I agree with you on Tucker. Very interesting case. To answer your question, I don’t think they’re at that point yet. Tucker had a solid spring. He was good during and after his debut. But between those two points, he hit about half his weight and struck out a ton. That’s not gonna get it done. He hasn’t done anything to this point to displace Adam Frazier or Kevin Newman, and I don’t know how I feel about either Tucker or Newman playing third base. Building off of something Shelton said -- that no one guy is gonna be the DH -- you need to account for Colin Moran’s bat, and to this point, Moran has been a better hitter than Tucker. But I do agree that Tucker has plenty of pedigree. I’d just like to see him force management into making a decision.</p>
<p><strong>Ted</strong>: With the surplus of middle infielders, any indication they plan on moving Frazier into a JHay role? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: None. Derek Shelton said yesterday that outside of an occasional four-man outfielder, which was first broached back in spring training 1.0, and an odd day here and there as a DH (for rest), Shelton views Frazier as a second baseman. Probably smart, too, as he was a Gold Glove finalist last season.</p>
<p><strong>Blackhawk Bob</strong>: With the new extra innings rule putting a runner on 2nd base...how will that runner be chosen ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Good question, Bob. It’s whoever made the last out the previous inning. Run will be unearned.</p>
<p><strong>Ted</strong>: In the event the pirates are sellers, which players are most likely to go? And with a shortened season, do u think teams will be more aggressive to make moves? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Couple guys. I think Keone Kela would be a logical one to move. He’s on an expiring contract, and the Pirates would be wise to get something for him. I could also see them looking to trade Adam Frazier. There was a lot of interest in Frazier at the Winter Meetings, and I can’t imagine that has changed. Furthermore, they have plenty of infielders -- really young and some just young. I don’t think he’s part of their plans past this year. Would make sense for them to get something for him if there’s interest. Could also see them entertaining deals for any offseason acquisition who has enjoyed a strong stretch and there’s interest -- Dyson, Heredia, Riddle, Maile, etc. I can’t imagine those guys would net a haul, but it would make sense for the Pirates to try and get something.</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: Hi Jason, <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hello, George.</p>
<p><strong>Max</strong>: Without fans, will there be any fanfare at pnc park? For example, walk up songs, pierogi races, spot the cow, 7th inning stretch? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hmm ... I haven’t thought a ton about that. I’m honestly not sure. I would think they would still do walkup songs, but I don’t know about the other stuff. Do me a favor Max: Ask this one next week. I promise you I’ll have a better answer.</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: with only 60 game schedule, do you think the Pirate young pitching staff should put it all on the line and try to get ahead of the Cardinals to take advantage of this shorten season <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi George. I don’t know what “put it all on the line” means. It sort of suggests that sometimes they do. Believe me, you all are welcome to criticize the Pirates ... and lately, you should. But it hasn’t been because they’ve decided to stop trying. ... To speak on the topic, though, I do think their pitching staff plays a huge role this season. I think over 60 games that they could be good enough to contend, sure. Those guys are better than they performed last year -- there were a lot of other issues, which I’ve mentioned in this space before -- and I wouldn’t be surprised if they bounced back. Their lack of depth worries me, but that wouldn’t be as much of a thing in a 60-game season.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: any New interest with the pirates and puig? He would be a great option. The pirates should be looking for any help they can get and Puig would be a huge boost. Do you think he will sign a contract Before opening day? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Nothing that I’ve heard, Ricky. It’s more just arranging the private jet, the limousine service and planning the parade route. That stuff takes time. Soon, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>Drew</strong>: Has there been any emphasis from management about the importance of getting off to a fast start? I would think that with a shortened season, teams can’t afford to start 2-8 and still consider themselves contenders unless they flip that record around in their next ten games, but a 2-8 start followed by 5-5 pretty much takes someone out of contention. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey Drew. I don’t think it’s just the Pirates. Obviously they’re gonna try to win every game -- hasn’t gone terribly well of late, I know -- but poor starts could be fascinating this season. If a team stinks, do some players pack it in because of COVID-19 and just say, “Nah, I’m good.” A poor start would be bad for the Pirates’ TV ratings if the Penguins are also playing and doing well, while I do think people would care if they’re at least able to compete. A lot of factors that go into it. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: We’re out of questions, folks, though I’m showing there are still plenty of people in the room. If you’re here and afraid to ask something, don’t be,</p>
<p><strong>Max</strong>: Has Archer thrown his last pitch as a pirate? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think so, yeah. It’s a shame, too, because I liked Archer, and I don’t think he’s anywhere near done as a pitcher. But business-wise, to me the smarter move is buying him out and cutting your losses. The Pirates have been all about starting anew with Cherington, Travis Williams, etc. Why should they have to pay for a bad trade? The best decision, right now, is to not pay that sort of money on a pitcher who’s 31, has plenty of miles on the tires, is coming off season-ending surgery and the worst year of his career, even if I believe there’s some context there that says Archer probably will wind up pitching somewhere in 2021, and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he did it well.</p>
<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Do you have any idea if the Pirates could replace Brito and Cederlind on the roster right now, or would they have to wait until Opening Day to do that? Also, Kramer and Archer haven’t officially been placed on the 45-day IL yet, have they? Any reason for the wait? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Jamie. If the Pirates replaced them on the 60-man pool, they would have to put them on waivers and/or release them. They’re not going to do that with Cederlind, and I’m not sure they’d want to do it with Brito, either. Also, there’s no urgency at this moment. As for the injured list, I think it’s more of a case of deadlines. Games are still a little away, stuff can happen. They’ll eventually finalize their 40-man roster -- guys like Holland, Evans, Riddle and Erlin aren’t on it -- so there will be subsequent moves to worry about as well. My guess is they’ll just wind up doing them all at once.</p>
<p><strong>Drew</strong>: Hadn’t thought about the impact on TV ratings that a poor start might cause, but I was thinking about a poor start being difficult to overcome for any team, not just the Pirates. There was an article on MLB.com this morning about seven possible surprises for this season and the writer (can’t remember who off the top of my head) indicated that NL fans would grow to love the DH...I’m not so sure. What do you think? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Oh, absolutely. I don’t think we’re going back. And I don’t think we should go back. Baseball needs to make itself as entertaining as possible. Using the DH is a part of that. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. Have a Pirates Zoom call at 1, so I have to run. Thanks for participating, as always. Talk to you all next week!</p>
