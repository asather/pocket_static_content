<h1>Watching from atop Highmark's tower for signs that the worst-case scenario is coming</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The end of the world can be seen from the 29th floor of a building in Downtown Pittsburgh. Here’s the scene:</p>
<p>Hundreds of people with suspected or confirmed infections from the new coronavirus jamming emergency rooms; rising numbers of feverish and coughing medical caregivers with symptoms of COVID-19; rationing lifesaving ventilators that are in short supply.</p>
<p>In fact, those scouting for the worst from the airy top of the Highmark Health tower at Fifth Avenue Place think it could look a lot like New York City does these days,&nbsp;where the rapid decline and death of COVID-19 patients astonishes doctors and nurses; or Lombardy, Italy, where hospitals scramble for intensive care beds and drugs used for sedation to slow a tide of critically ill patients.</p>
<p>Atop Fifth Avenue Place, Highmark’s nerve center —&nbsp;a board meeting room with huge windows and sweeping views of empty Pittsburgh streets 29 floors below — has been turned into a pandemic readiness center staffed 12 hours a day by Allegheny Health Network doctors and nurses. They’re tracking the spread of the fast-moving disease by monitoring the use of hospital beds and other medical resources throughout the AHN system.</p>
<p>“Italy is the worst example of how things could go” for Pittsburgh, said Timothy Sauber, an Allegheny Health Network orthopedic surgeon doing double duty these days monitoring system resources&nbsp;in the Highmark command center. “It’s just not having the resources to help people.”</p>
<p>Helping people during a raging pandemic starts with tracking AHN’s resources in real time —&nbsp;intensive care unit beds, protective masks, available staffing —&nbsp;for the earliest signs of strain caused by escalating demand. Dr. Sauber’s goal is simply to outrun the disease in the Western Pennsylvania area by moving assets and trained people to the places where they’re needed. So far, that hasn’t been necessary.</p>
<p>But there’s a big price to be paid for not being ready.</p>
<p>“We have to hope for the best and plan for the worst,” said Highmark President and CEO David Holmberg, who like others in the room, wore a protective face mask. He called the converted board room the health system’s “radar room.”</p>
<p>There was no sign of the worst Thursday morning. Looking over giant display screens showing the number of available beds and other data from each of AHN’s nine hospitals, Dr. Sauber said the system of 2,200 beds had a reserve capacity of at least 50%, which could be quickly doubled if the need arose.</p>
<p>Reduced patient volume — ranging between 30% and 50% as the result of closing doctors’ offices and canceled elective operations — had created room in the system, said Angela Costa, another member of the team who is vice president of nursing at AHN.</p>
<p>Virtually every U.S. hospital has seen similar declines in the number of patients because of the outbreak of the highly contagious respiratory disease.</p>
<p>From the viewpoint of those working in Highmark’s operations center, here’s what trouble would look like:&nbsp;Hundreds of patients with suspected or confirmed new coronavirus infections turning up at AHN hospital emergency rooms each day, quickly overwhelming front line nurses and doctors who can comfortably treat 20 to 30 COVID-19 patients a day,&nbsp;with exponential increases in the number of sick people showing up every day thereafter — 200, 400, 800.</p>
<p>The scene would be repeated at every other hospital, tearing at the region’s health care safety net.</p>
<p>If that happens — and the models can predict but not confirm that it will —&nbsp;AHN surgeons would be asked to postpone some serious operations to convert operating rooms to intensive care units. Hospitalized patients on the mend might be referred to home care to free up beds, sicker patients could begin to be moved into the system’s four outpatient surgical centers, giving hospitals room for people infected by the virus.</p>
<p>“The bigger problem is the exponential growth” in the number of sick people, Dr. Sauber said. “When you start to see a doubling of the numbers every day, it’s a problem.”</p>
<p>That’s what happened in New York and Italy when demand for medical care exceeded the amount of equipment and available doctors and nurses. The result was needless deaths, the price of not being fully prepared.</p>
<p>All of Gov. Tom Wolf’s mitigation efforts — a ban on unnecessary travel, mandated school and business closings, the recommendation for wearing protective masks in public places —&nbsp;are aimed at keeping a flood of people with COVID-19 from crashing the Pennsylvania health care system. A new University of Washington study suggests those measures may be working.</p>
<p>Still, health officials nervously await a predicted peak surge in the number of COVID-19 patients across Pennsylvania, which could start Sunday, with the highest demand for medical supplies and personnel testing the system the following day, according to projections developed by Christopher Murray, professor of Global Health at the University of Washington, based on what happened in China and other countries.</p>
<p>But the surge could extend into early June and the model forecasts nearly 1,000 deaths from the disease in Pennsylvania by Aug. 4.</p>
<p>Dr. Sauber noted that some forecasts include a resurgence of the disease in the fall.</p>
<p>Reality might not match the projections, as mitigation efforts and other factors shift the progression of the disease.</p>
<p>Among the states, the top risk factors that account for differences in the number of people who die from the disease were diet, obesity, high blood pressure, tobacco use and physical inactivity, according to Dr. Murray’s April 7 study.</p>
<p>On the front lines of the battle against the wildfire spread of the new disease are nurses like Ms. Costa, who are deeply affected by the loss of a patient.</p>
<p>“Every time someone dies, it takes part of the caregiver with them,” she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Murray’s graphic for Pennsylvania, with the stepladder spike around April 12 indicating a sharp rise in patient volume, is displayed on one of several oversize computer screens around the Highmark board room-turned-operations center.</p>
<p>Another screen has real time numbers for available beds and ventilators at every AHN hospital.</p>
<p>A dark wooden table taking up the middle of the room was outfitted with telephones for easy access to the health system’s hospitals and other facilities.</p>
<p>The phones were quiet Thursday.</p>
