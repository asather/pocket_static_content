<h1>Gene Collier: Weak and weary, Steelers ponder the scariest Ravens ever</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A week out from being bashed in Baltimore, the Steelers might, in the interest of optimal mental health, be eager to repress the memory of Ravens 28, Steelers 10.</p>
<p>That would be a mistake.</p>
<p>What went down on the soggy lawn by the Inner Harbor last Sunday was more than three hours of a cold, driving rain. It was more like December ending with yet another appearance by the ghost of Christmas future. If the rain was a metaphor for the way the Pittsburgh view of this rivalry sets up for the start of a new decade, well, as Dylan said, “It’s a hard rain’s a gonna fall.”</p>
<p>Resting seven starters — including six Pro Bowl players — and with zero at stake regarding their playoff pole position, the Ravens unleashed a passionate, record-breaking performance that didn’t feel so much like an explosion as an ominous expansion of the chasm between the franchises.</p>
<p>And Lamar Jackson did not even play.</p>
<p>“We were playing the Pittsburgh Steelers; you look at the history of the game, it’s a rivalry,” said Chuck Clark, Baltimore’s strong safety. “That was definitely the mentality going into it. I wouldn’t say that we didn’t have anything to play for. I mean, we were trying to knock them out of the playoffs.”</p>
<p>Knock they did. Knock knock. Who’s there? Not the Ravens you’ve come to know and detest.</p>
<p>To think it was only the middle of last season when head coach John Harbaugh, covering his ears from an aural assault that trumpeted his firing, decided he’d seen enough of Joe Flacco. The Ravens were 11-12 in Flacco’s last 23 starts. Harbaugh deployed Jackson. The Ravens are 20-3 in his first 23 starts. The Steelers, by contrast, have just about flat-lined. They were 8-6 after Roethlisberger’s injury. In the 14 games he started before tearing up his elbow, they were 8-6.</p>
<p>The team Baltimore will take into the playoffs next week is merely the greatest in Ravens history. You can argue for either of its Super Bowl champions or any of its Ray Lewis-Terrell Suggs-Ed Reed defensive monuments, but no Ravens team can match this edition’s 14-2 record, nor its 12-game winning streak (with an average scoring margin of nearly 19 points), nor its NFL record-breaking 3,296 yards rushing, the last 223 of which went straight down the gullet of its archrival.</p>
<p>Yes, remember running the ball?</p>
<p>Given the weight of the numbers and the fact that running the ball smacks of a bygone area, Harbaugh should perhaps get a waiver for his hyperbole.</p>
<p>“That’s like Joe DiMaggio’s record,” he blurted postgame. “That’s the record (3,165 rushing yards by the 1978 Patriots) that would never be broken, and it’s just been broken by the 2019 Baltimore Ravens. And (we are) the first team ever to average 200 yards rushing and 200 yards passing in a season, is that right?”</p>
<p>Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p>More pointedly for Pittsburgh, in the tradition of Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier, the Ravens had two 1,000-yard rushers. It’s only been done seven times in the league’s 100 years. For only the second time, one of those 1,000 yards was the quarterback, Jackson, who led the club with 1,206 (Michael Vick was the other QB).</p>
<p>Give Harbaugh a load of credit for envisioning the potential impact of Jackson rather than join the smattering of draft analysts who’d encouraged the player to switch positions.</p>
<p>“We felt like we could build something that was different than what was currently, is being run, most of the time, in the National Football League,” Harbaugh said. “Lamar Jackson is obviously what we’re talking about because he was going to be our quarterback, but it goes back to all the players. A lot of these plays were run in San Francisco when (offensive coordinator) Greg Roman was there with my brother (Jim, then the Niners head coach), but a lot of them weren’t. A lot are different and new, but the players are the ones who put the personality and the flavor to it.”</p>
<p>You could say the Steelers got every bit of the flavor, more than their fill, but again, Jackson didn’t even play and neither did Mark Ingram, who settled for 1,018 yards in 15 games. Even at that, backup Gus Edwards trampled them for 130 yards on 21 carries.</p>
<p>“It’s crazy, being able to go out there and do what we do, week-in and week-out,” said offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr. “It’s just a credit to Greg Roman, what he and his team does, in terms of offensive coaches, putting us in the right positions to succeed every week.”</p>
<p>So when the 2020 NFL season starts, the Steelers and Ravens will be on an even footing only in the sense that the franchises will have the same record. Otherwise, your preseason comparisons will recall that the Ravens averaged 33.18 points in 2019 while the Steelers never scored more than 28. That the Ravens scored 59 against Miami while the Steelers scored 53 over the season’s last four weeks.</p>
<p>Further, Lamar Jackson is 22, and Gus Edwards is 24.</p>
<p>You know what they call Edwards in Baltimore?</p>
<p>The Bus.</p>
<p>Oh, mercy.</p>
