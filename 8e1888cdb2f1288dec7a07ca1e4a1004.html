Ms. Yesko will offer participants step-by-step instructions on how to declutter and get organized.</p><p>“I think one of the most important things that I have to share is we tend to lump in decluttering with organizing,” Ms. Yesko said.</p><p>Although decluttering is a step in organizing, Ms. Yesko said it’s a “completely separate process.”</p><p>In the class, Ms. Yesko will teach participants her methods to declutter as well as to get organized.</p><p>“Decluttering is really the primary beginning before you can get organized,” she said.</p><p>“Being organized is, I think, a synonym for being prepared. Being prepared is one of the best gifts you can give yourself.”</p><p>Ms. Yesko advises those who want to get organized to start with “little, tiny changes” which she said will go on to make “huge, huge impacts.”</p><p>Simply starting to put something away when finished using it will help.</p><p>“As soon as we slightly change a routine, we have success instantly,” she said.</p><p>For instance, Ms. Yesko used the kitchen, which is often the heart of one’s home, as an example of where small changes can make a difference.</p><p>“A lot of people are good with doing their dishes and putting them away … because there’s a home for that dish and there’s a home for that fork because there’s a little notch in your utensil drawer that’s shaped like a fork,” she said.</p><p>However, bringing in something new is where clutter begins.</p><p>“The reason there’s clutter is that there isn’t room for something new coming in. So we put it on the counter ‘for now,’” she said.</p><p>“Don’t put it down — put it away.”</p><p>Holiday decorations, for example, should be placed in a spot where they would most likely be used the next year. Ms. Yesko also advised using labels to make sure one knows exactly what something is if it’s in a box or a bin.</p><p>She added that people often want to tackle huge projects instead of doing a little bit of organizing at a time.</p><p>“Fifteen minutes a day is amazing. I call it pulling back the arrow where you’re not really shooting the target yet,” Ms. Yesko said.</p><p>Taking 15 minutes, she said, to analyze what clutter needs to be tackled can be very helpful. Additionally, taking 15 minutes in between activities to regroup can also be beneficial.</p><p>Ideally, Ms. Yesko said, it would be great to “turn back the hands of time” and start the decluttering and organizing process in October, to make room for new items coming into the house.</p><p>“A lot of new stuff is going to be coming in, from big electronics to maybe a big toy if you have kids,” she said, adding October is a great time to gather things that could be donated to charity.</p><p>Ms. Yesko said she will be using the session to share with people as many free resources as possible to help to get organized.</p><p>The Peters Township Library requests registration for the “Get Organized for Good” presentation as seating is limited.
