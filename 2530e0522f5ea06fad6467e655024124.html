<h1>Contact tracing slowly taking shape</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Contact tracing is well underway in Allegheny County and other local counties that have begun reopening their economies.</p>
<p>In Allegheny and the state, officials would like to get more workers involved. The problem in other local counties isn’t people —&nbsp;it’s communication.</p>
<p>Dr. Debra Bogen, director of the Allegheny County Health Department, said the department has only “a few people doing contact tracing because of the number of cases we’ve seen has been low” along with the fact that people countywide continue to stay at home out of fear of contracting COVID-19.</p>
<p>“But we’re planning an expansion of that number, if cases increase as people get out and about, get back on buses and go to work,” she said. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the potential for a wide range of scenarios, she said, the contact-tracing plan could expand or contract as needed, with program costs dependent on how many people are hired to do the work.</p>
<p>This week, the county health department <a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=9bc474f2ba377cd7&amp;q=Media,+communications&amp;l=Pittsburgh,+PA&amp;tk=1e8p708193d9q802&amp;from=ja&amp;alid=5de522097f880033fdd82cb8&amp;utm_campaign=job_alerts&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=jobseeker_emails&amp;rgtk=1e8p708193d9q802" target="_blank">advertised for full-time contact tracers</a>, with candidates required to have at least an associate degree with a bachelor’s degree preferred. The wage is listed at $19.23 an hour with the job to run for one year, beginning June 1.</p>
<p>In surrounding counties, contact tracing also is underway — to the surprise of county officials.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t even tell you who our local Department of Health contact is,” said Butler County Emergency Management Director Steve Bicehouse, referring to DOH community nurses assigned to counties lacking their own health departments.</p>
<p>Saying the situation is “disheartening and frustrating,” he noted that he gets most of his information through the media.</p>
<p>“To be frank, I haven’t been contacted by the DOH throughout the whole pandemic,” Mr. Bicehouse said. “Whatever the plan is for contact tracing, they are not sharing it with this county emergency management director.”</p>
<p>Washington County Emergency Management Director Jeffrey Yates also expressed frustration over the lack of information about contact tracing that’s apparently underway in his county.</p>
<p>“Actually, I emailed our DOH [community nurse] this morning about contact tracing, but no one reached out directly to us or said anything about it,” he said. “That’s the way it has been.</p>
<p>“We’re really in the dark most of the time regarding that,” he added.&nbsp;“I understand what’s happening and why, but it would be nice to have more contact with the Health Department, given the fact we have one or two positive cases a day.”</p>
<p>Responding to that criticism, state Department of Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said Tuesday that she will have discussions with the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency concerning keeping in contact with counties.</p>
<p>Labor-intensive contact tracing involves people trained to track down those who have had direct exposure with people later diagnosed with COVID-19. Identifying them and having them isolate themselves for 14 days helps prevent a resurgence of infections once a county begins reopening its economy.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine said the DOH has adequate staffing in place in smaller counties “but we are working to increase our staff,” with the&nbsp;goal of &nbsp;having several thousand people statewide who are trained to complete the tasks involved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Current staffing is nowhere near those levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department spokesman Nate Wardle said that last week, the state “had more than 200 staff participating in contact tracing, between our employees and the municipal and county health departments.”</p>
<p>“The majority of these are state Department of Health employees,” he said. “We also have close to 100 additional volunteers involved in this work.”</p>
<p>For now, he said, the department doesn’t have exact numbers of contact tracers in counties that have their own health departments, which are taking the lead in doing contact tracing. Those include Allegheny and Erie counties.</p>
<p>“But we do know they will have a considerable number [of contact tracers] as well,” Mr. Wardle said.&nbsp;“We are in continued conversations with academic institutions, public and private organizations and others about the potential for them to join us in this effort.”</p>
<p>Contact tracing got underway throughout the state during the week of April 20, he said.&nbsp;“We have always been doing case notifications throughout our response, and urging the cases to notify close contacts,” he said.</p>
<p>The national Center for Health Security has recommended that 100,000 additional contact tracers be hired nationwide at a cost of $3.6 billion. That would average about one contact tracer for every&nbsp;3,300 people.</p>
<p>At that rate, Pennsylvania, with a population of 12.8 million people would require nearly 3,900 tracers, all of them specially trained. Allegheny County and its population of nearly 1.2 million would require about 360 tracers.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says contact testing is important to control and prevent a pandemic resurgence, with contact tracers requiring special skills.</p>
<p>They must work with people who are infected&nbsp;“to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the time frame while they may have been infectious.”</p>
<p>Next, they must warn those individuals about their potential exposure as rapidly and sensitively as possible, without identifying the infected person. Those individuals also must be schooled about their risk and potential to infect others, along with how to monitor themselves for infection.</p>
<p>“Contacts are encouraged to stay home and maintain social distance from others (at least 6 feet) until 14 days after their last exposure, in case they also become ill,” the CDC says.</p>
<p>Kristin D’Acunto, an assistant professor in the Duquesne University Rangos School of Health Sciences with expertise in infectious diseases and contract tracing, said the county should plan to hire&nbsp;360 tracers — 30 contact tracers per 100,000 population —&nbsp;“sooner rather than later”&nbsp;in the event of a spike in COVID-19 cases once the economy truly begins to reopen.</p>
<p>For now,&nbsp;the county plan seems reasonable, given the slow pace of renewed economic activity and with the hiring advertisement in place. Given the low case count, she said, the economy should be reopening even faster.</p>
<p>“You can’t live in a bubble, but you need to exercise caution,” she said.&nbsp;“But if you foresee a spike in cases with the reopening of the county, you should be sure to have 360 contact tracers available.”</p>
