<h1>Pittsburgh man who punched EMTs has history of fighting police</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man’s Saturday evening standoff with SWAT wasn’t the first time he clashed with police.</p>
<p>Joseph Sadar, 51, was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/25/SWAT-incident-Windgap-pittsburgh/stories/202001250055" target="_blank">charged Saturday</a>&nbsp;with six counts of aggravated assault and one count of resisting arrest. It was the third time in less than eight years that Mr. Sadar received such charges.</p>
<p>Court records show Mr. Sadar was charged in 2017 with resisting arrest and two charges of recklessly endangering another person. In 2012, he was charged with resisting arrest, two counts of aggravated assault and other charges.</p>
<p>In 2017, police arrived at a Mount Oliver home to serve a mental health warrant. Mr. Sadar barricaded himself inside the home and threw bricks at police, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2017/10/28/mt-oliver-swat-man-throws-bricks-police/" target="_blank">reports</a>&nbsp;from KDKA, the Post-Gazette’s news partner. Mount Oliver police and SWAT made it into the house and discovered kitchen knives strewn throughout the bedroom. No police were injured during that confrontation.</p>
<p>Officers who arrived to arrest Mr. Sadar on Saturday couldn’t say the same.</p>
<p>Two EMTs arrived at the 3700 block of Windgap Avenue in Pittsburgh’s Windgap neighborhood Saturday just after 3:45 p.m. They were called in for a wellness check on an elderly woman, according to a criminal complaint. When they entered the home, they spoke to Mr. Sadar, the woman’s son.</p>
<p>At first, they experienced no problems with him.&nbsp;But when the woman refused treatment and the medics began to leave the house, things turned violent. Mr. Sadar struck one of the EMTs twice, exclaiming,&nbsp;“You’re not welcome here,” the criminal complaint says.</p>
<p>Mr. Sadar then punched the other medic three times in the face before the EMTs fled the house and were transported to a hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police arrived at the home in response to the assault on the medics. Mr. Sadar barricaded himself inside, and officers could hear him pounding on the walls, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Police said they heard Mr. Sadar yell,&nbsp;“You’re going to beat me up like they did in Mount Oliver!”&nbsp;</p>
<p>SWAT officers arrived and breached the home, but Mr. Sadar&nbsp;“fought, resisted arrest and ignored officer’s commands,” the complaint says. He threw a dresser and an air condition unit at SWAT officers, hitting one of them. Another officer was bitten by a small dog. Both officers sustained minor injuries.</p>
<p>The conflict ended when police tased Mr. Sadar and he was taken into custody just after 6:30 p.m. His mother was transported to a hospital, and the small dog was taken by animal control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Sadar’s preliminary hearing is set for Feb. 4.&nbsp;</p>
