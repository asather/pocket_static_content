<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 04.08.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey everyone. Hope you're having a great Wednesday. Looking forward to this week's chat. Please feel free to leave your questions now. I'll be back at noon to answer 'em. Thanks, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>TPhunter</strong>: Thank you for your time, Jason. I watched the MLB Network 1979 World Series Game 5 replay Monday between the Pirates and Baltimore, far before your time, of course. That was the last World Series game played in Pittsburgh. The next one will be ....? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Alright folks. Let's do this. Was finishing something real quick. Apologize for the delay. ... I'm sorry I missed that. I was busy with something. Can't remember what off-hand, but I really wanted to watch it. Yes, before my time, but that doesn't mean I don't respect and love the hell out of it. Those old games are so much fun. To your question: I can't give you a year. But it'll be after baseball changes its economic structure, Bob Nutting sells or perhaps both.</p>
<p><strong>TPhunter</strong>: Jason, do you see any chance of the plan to hold the entire Major League season in Arizona being implemented? Seems ridiculous to me. If you can't play the season at the home fields of the teams, why bother? We can watch virtual baseball all we want on our game boxes. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't see any hope for that plan the way it's currently constituted, honestly. I think there are some good things contained, but I don't see how you can take a risk like that right now. What if someone contracts COVID-19? What happens then? That said, if things overall improve, then I think it does make sense to confine things to spring training facilities, which are smaller and easier to control.</p>
<p><strong>TPhunter</strong>: Jason, if the season is canceled, is it a plus or a minus for the Pirates, given that they were not going to contend anyway. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It's a big minus, and here's why: Keone Kela will be a FA. You lose him for nothing. They probably buy out Chris Archer. Both walk, and they get nothing back. Bryan Reynolds and Kevin Newman get service time, taking them closer to arbitration and free agency, but the Pirates don't get any baseball out of those years. Jarrod Dyson and Derek Holland are gone. Maybe they could have moved those guys for pieces. If the season is canceled, as I've written, it kinda stinks for the Pirates.</p>
<p><strong>Todd</strong>: have you been able to talk to any players about the proposed Arizona season idea? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I texted with Taillon yesterday. I've been tied up with two other stories while also wanting to let the news kind of sink in and see where this goes. I plan on reaching out to several this afternoon to gauge interest.</p>
<p><strong>Rich from Indio</strong>: How serious are the talks to open MLB season in Arizona in May? They only have 11 ball parks including D-backs park. That means 8 teams sit everyday unless they play day/night doubleheaders. I think it's better to NL to FLA and AL to AZ type set up. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I worry about the state of COVID-19 in Florida. It's not great. I think that's maybe one reason. But it's also tougher because Florida spring training sites are separated by 220 miles, whereas Arizona's are separated by 50 or so. Logistically and taking nothing else into account, Arizona does make more sense here.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Hi Jason-- Hope you're doing well. If/when the season starts, who do you see emerging as the backup to Stallings? I think John Ryan Murphy was making a solid case for himself and the fact that Maile can be optioned to AAA can help preserve depth. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey Bill. Hope you're doing well, too. It's going to be Maile. They like him a lot. Big reason has been his defense, including therein Maile's handling of pitchers. He also threw quite well this spring, where Murphy definitely did not. Yeah, Murphy hit the three home runs, and that was great. But career profiles say Maile won't hit much (he didn't in spring) and neither will Murphy. Difference is defense, and Maile did nothing to relinquish an advantage he probably held there coming in.</p>
<p><strong>Brian</strong>: What a good way to get a sports/baseball fix as the weather turns nice? It feels weird not enjoying a warm breeze during a day game this time of year. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Outside? That's a tough one. There's basically nothing. I've really been loving MLB Network airing classic games in the afternoon, along with the AT&amp;T SportsNet programming, although I haven't watched as much of it as I would like.</p>
<p><strong>Kev Ball</strong>: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jason thanks for the chat! What is your assessment of Taillon’s future as a rotation anchor? And do you think the Pirates expect him to be successful in that role despite the 2 TJ surgeries?</span> <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Kev. It's probably non-conventional or weird to say you have confidence in a guy coming back from a second Tommy John surgery, but I do with Taillon. Not only is the guy due a run of good luck for once, but he works his butt off. I don't know what more you could possibly want from the guy: Gives max effort, nice to everybody, wants like hell to be good. We could sit here and pick apart his physiology or body movement, I guess, but I'm sure no expert. He has also gone everywhere looking for answers. I just keep thinking that at some point this dude -- sort of like Olli Maatta -- is finally gonna get the run of good health that he so badly deserves.</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: What do you think the roster looks like after the delayed start to the season. Other than the Tallion everyone should be healthy. Curious how the utility roles, 5th starter and bullpen aligns. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yeah, I think it will have to look different in a way because I think they'll have to have an expanded roster. As of now, I would go with something like this. Starting position players: Newman, Reynolds, Frazier, Bell, Polanco, Moran, Dyson, Stallings ... Starting pitchers: Archer, Williams, Musgrove, Keller and Holland. ... Bench: Riddle, Maile, Heredia, Gonzalez and Osuna. ... Bullpen: Kela, Crick, Rodriguez, Burdi, Santana, Feliz, Stratton, Burdi and Brault (or Erlin if Brault isn't healthy).</p>
<p><strong>Larry</strong>: Do you MLB trying another way to have baseball later on if the Arizona plan does not work out? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I do, Larry. This Arizona plans tells me a couple things. One, it's not dead. If Dr. Anthony Fauci says he sees some merit to it, then I think that's all you need to hear, though I do think it will require some tweaks. I also think there are some things you can take with this place and use differently. Like keeping things at spring training sites. Or areas contained.</p>
<p><strong>Gregory polanco</strong>: My 2020 stats will be: <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey Gregory. Hope you're well. Hard to say exact numbers, but I think you play 135-140 games this year. Would project an average around .280. Maybe 15-20 homers, 80-90 RBIs. Probably some shaky/questionable plays in right field, too. But I see you being pretty darn productive at the plate, assuming you can stay healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: In theory, they could have the entire 40-man roster active and accruing service and major league salary in Arizona, but seriously, would that still be enough? 100+ temps playing 7, 8, 9 games a week maybe. Doesn't seem tenable. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Seriously. There are a few different questions I have with this. One involves what you mentioned: the roster size. If they're starting in mid-May -- again, theoretically -- and playing doubleheaders in these temps, you have to have at least 30 on the roster, probably more. Moreover, they're trying to do this self-contained bubble. Anybody who comes in, then, would have to self-quarantine for two weeks, making sure they don't have symptoms and can't infect everyone with COVID-19. Therefore, you're going to have to make sure you have guys in reserve in case others can't go, which basically creates like a Black Ace situation in hockey. Do these guys make major league money? Are they going there just to hang out? So many unanswered questions right now.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Any plans for minor league games to be played? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: At this point, Alan, no. At least not that I or anyone else has heard. Maybe Rob Manfred is talking about it privately with folks, but that would be about it. I think they need to get the major league stuff ironed out first.</p>
<p><strong>It’s yo boi</strong>: Whats your thoughts on stallings? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think he is, at minimum, a really solid backup. And he may be more than that. He throws extremely well. Good at blocking. Really improving his pitch-framing last year. Total son fo a coach, too. Every drill he does is to a T. The issue for me is hitting. Is he going to hit enough to justify being a No. 1? If he does, then I think the Pirates are just fine. But they need something more than they got last season out of that position.</p>
<p><strong>Butch</strong>: What current pirates do you feel like may have played there last game as a pirate if there is no season? Bell, Archer, or Kela? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Kela for sure. Probably Archer. (His buyout is $250,000 versus an $11 million option. I can't imagine the Pirates picking that up under the circumstances.) I do think Bell comes back. I think ideally you try to sign him long-term. But even if you can't, the best exit strategy, for me, would be for him to produce a ton, do it consistently, then you cash in on that. I think right now his value isn't as high as it could be because of how he finished 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: I've heard it suggested that if the season does start, low revenue teams may sell off players immediately to solve lost revenue concerns. Could we see this with the Pirates, in your opinion? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know, Sam. I understand -- sort of -- Bob Nutting's desire to keep costs down and not spend a ton of money now, hopefully saving it for later. But if he would salary dump Chris Archer or Keone Kela the minute baseball got back (and not at, say, the deadline, which would at least be smart business), then I think he would deserve to be skewered for that, for taking away fans' (already) faint amount of hope. I also don't think he would do it, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: For context, this apparently happened during strike shortened seasons. Forgot to mention that. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I gotcha. Either way, I don't see it happening. But thank you for the question.</p>
<p><strong>david gross</strong>: ifthey play in az. are reporters stuck there 5 months? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey Dave. Yep, it sounds like if they play in Arizona, we would be there, too, assuming there's room for us. But I think if you would cover it, you would be the same as players, etc. For safety.</p>
<p><strong>wvpirate</strong>: If the Pirates play in Arizona but no minor league games. Would Hayes benefit more from playing in the majors than not playing at all? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Good question. I think so. I also think with the roster rules and probably needing to include more guys, that would be a natural move, to include Hayes on the major league roster. I think you would probably include Tucker at that point, too, and just have a pretty free infield rotation. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. I guess that does it for this week. Thanks so much for participating. Looking forward to doing this again next Wednesday!</p>
