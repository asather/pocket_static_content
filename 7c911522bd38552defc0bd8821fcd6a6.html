<h1>Pirates' Cole Tucker using 'MLB: The Show' tournament as temporary replacement for regular season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cole Tucker hadn’t really played&nbsp;“MLB: The Show” before his agent called him about two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball has put together a players’ tournament with the video game while the regular season is delayed due to the COVID-19 crisis, with one player from each MLB team playing in the tournament. Tucker is the Pirates’ representative.</p>
<p>Records are kept and standings are updated, but the main draw is a charitable cause. MLB is donating $5,000 in the name of each player to the Boys &amp; Girls Club affiliate in their team’s community.</p>
<p>With that in mind, along with the lack of possible activities for Tucker during this time, the 22-year-old shortstop agreed to participate, borrowing his friend’s Playstation to join the league.</p>
<p>On Monday night, Tucker played his first four games, going 1-3 with his lone win coming against outfielder Hunter Pence and the virtual San Francisco Giants. He isn’t too concerned with the wins and losses, though. He’s happy to participate for a charitable cause, and the livestream of his games on Twitch, where fans can watch along and interact with Tucker in the comments section, makes it all the more enjoyable.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘You know what? Screw it. I’ll figure it out and learn on the fly.’ ” Tucker said Tuesday. “I said earlier today, it’s like getting in the big leagues and not knowing what to expect and trying to find your footing in front of a lot of people who are watching. But it was really fun. Beating Pence was sweet. It was really cool to play against him, just because I have so much respect for him and what he’s done in the game and off the field, too. But it was fun. Interacting with the fans was really cool.”</p>
<p>While Tucker is certainly enjoying this experience, he, like any other major leaguer right now, would prefer to be on a real diamond somewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s especially true given how he left off when the season was put to a halt. In 12 spring training games, Tucker was hitting .296 with three home runs and seven RBIs. He called it the best spring training of his life.</p>
<p>So even though Tucker emphasized that he understands the importance of stopping baseball for the sake of public health, it’s a little tough to swallow for him.</p>
<p>“I’d be lying to you if I said I wasn’t bummed about kind of losing that momentum,” Tucker said. “It wasn’t hard to go home because I was excited to see my family and stuff, but it was hard to go home on that note. I was swinging it so well, and I felt so good. I really worked hard on my approach and swing and all that in the offseason, and it was showing up in the games at a really high level. [I was] hitting some balls out of the park and all that, and it was fun.</p>
<p>“But I feel like I can continue that when I get back. I know what kind of mentality and thought process and athleticism I can bring up to the plate with me. So I think I’ll be able to pick that back up when we get rolling, but I’d be lying if I said if we were playing right now, playing in Cincinnati or wherever the hell we would be, [I wouldn’t be] putting up some numbers and feeling pretty good about myself.”</p>
<p>For now, though, that can’t be helped. Tucker, an Arizona native, has been hitting at a private facility with some friends and his younger brother, Carson, a high-end prospect in the 2020 MLB Draft.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Tucker will camp out and wait for the season to begin. In the short-term, he says he’ll be getting some practice in for his next&nbsp;“MLB: The Show” games on Wednesday night. He believes he’ll put on a better performance then.</p>
<p>Even if he doesn’t, he’s enjoying the opportunity to participate. To him, it even feels a little bit like he’s back playing in real life. It’s about as close as he can get for now.</p>
<p>“I called my mom after [Monday’s games], and I said, ‘Mom, I’m in a really good mood. This was fun,’ ” Tucker said. “Because you get that rush of interacting with the fans and performing and being on the stage again. It felt almost like playing baseball without the physical demand of it, but it was a lot of fun and the experience of being able to do this was really cool.”</p>
