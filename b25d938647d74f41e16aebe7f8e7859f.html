<h1>Murrysville entrepreneur scores deal for flexible window screens on 'Shark Tank'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Joe Altieri swam with the sharks and survived. In fact, he came out in even better shape than before.</p>
<p>Mr. Altieri founded FlexScreen, a mesh window screen company based in Murrysville, as an alternative to traditional screens that are difficult to install, prone to damage and likely to obscure the outside world.</p>
<p>On Sunday night, he pitched his window screens on national television as a contestant on ABC’s “Shark Tank,” which brings entrepreneurs in front of prominent investors in the hope of sparking a spontaneous funding deal.</p>
<p>Mr. Altieri walked away with a $400,000 investment and a $400,000 line of credit from Lori Greiner, a well-known inventor, investor and celebrity personality on QVC-TV.</p>
<p>“In our industry, the window and door industry, we’re kind of window famous —&nbsp;it’s a dramatic shift in window screen technology —&nbsp;but it’s hard to get out to the consumers from where we’re at as a component on a window. As of yesterday, that changed,” he said Monday, adding that his team started seeing a drastic spike in website traffic and online sales as soon as the show aired.</p>
<p>FlexScreen —&nbsp;which also has plants in Georgia, Michigan and South Dakota and is planning to open another in Toronto this spring — generated about $5 million in revenue in 2018. Mr. Altieri said the company did not have final numbers for 2019 yet but expected revenue to double.</p>
<p>With about 20 years of experience in the windows and doors industry, Mr. Altieri said he came up with the idea for the mesh window screens after getting frustrated with how easily traditional screens would get damaged and need repairs.</p>
<p>He started experimenting in his garage and came up with a rough prototype that has now morphed into a product he hopes will one day become the standard for window screens around the world.</p>
<p>“Shark Tank” producers approached FlexScreen to apply for the show in March 2019. From there, the company went through several rounds of submitting information to the producers from financial statements to video clips proving Mr. Altieri could hold his own in front of a camera.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of hand-holding through the entire process so an average Joe Blow who makes something in a garage like me is comfortable in this atmosphere,” he said. “They have to be a little bit of a producer, a little bit of a coach, a little bit of a babysitter.”</p>
<p>Each season, the show receives applications from about 40,000 entrepreneurs, according to a blog post from “shark” Daymond John. Of those, about 150 people get to pitch their idea to the investors and about 100 appear on air.</p>
<p>The pitch lasts about an hour but is consolidated to just a short segment for the show, which is in its 11th season.</p>
<p>In the show’s 10th season, the average deal was about $343,650, according to data collected by Halle Tecco, a self-described Shark Tank fanatic and angel investor.</p>
<p>Craig Markovitz, an assistant teaching professor of entrepreneurship and an entrepreneur in residence at Carnegie Mellon University’s Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship, said a show such as “Shark Tank” wouldn’t work for just any company.</p>
<p>The business would have to be far enough along that it could show impact and “traction,” or that it has tangible accomplishments, and the founders would have to be personable and concise.</p>
<p>“I think the mistake people make, both on the show and in real life, is they get too bogged down in the details,” Mr. Markovitz said. “People make decisions based on one question, and that question is: what’s in it for me?”</p>
<p>In the end, he said, one of the biggest benefits of such an experience for an entrepreneur is growing your network and practicing your pitch.</p>
<p>For Mr. Altieri, the experience was nerve-wracking, but he began to calm down as he got into the rhythm of his pitch —&nbsp;remembering that he had done this thousands of times to other customers and manufacturers. Once the jitters and nerves stopped, he said, it was “just five people interested in your business.”</p>
<p>In his segment Sunday, Mr. Altieri fielded three investment offers from Ms. Greiner, Barbara Corcoran and Kevin O’Leary. Pittsburgh native Mark Cuban opted not to invest, saying, “I’m not the window guy, even though I like to be able to help everybody from Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>With the new investment, FlexScreen and Ms. Greiner plan to open a new retail arm of the business, expanding beyond its current base of window manufacturers to individual consumers.</p>
<p>“The ‘Shark Tank’ effect is very, very real,” Mr. Altieri said. “It changes companies overnight.”</p>
<p>Jamie and Brian Ratner experienced that shift firsthand when they pitched their company CertifiKID, a Maryland-based website offering discounts on kids’ activities and family experiences, to “Shark Tank investors” in April.</p>
<p>Ms. Ratner, CEO and founder of the company and a Penn State alumna, and Mr. Ratner, a Greensburg native and president of CertifiKID, said the exposure from the show helped them gain 12,000 additional subscribers in the first six weeks after it aired.</p>
<p>They have also accompanied Mr. O’Leary, who invested $600,000 in their business, on “The View” television show and have seen their episode re-aired at least two times —&nbsp;and each appearance leads to more interest from new subscribers.</p>
<p>The couple credited “Shark Tank” and Mr. O’Leary as part of the reason they are able to start preparing for a nationwide launch later this month, rather than operating in just a few cities.</p>
<p>“I thought it would give us new opportunities and it was the right timing. We were at a good point in the business where we were ready to be set on fire, to go crazy,” Ms. Ratner said of her push to apply to be on the show.</p>
<p>“It was an amazing, crazy rollercoaster, once-in-a-lifetime experience for us. It still feels like we’re on a ride.”</p>
