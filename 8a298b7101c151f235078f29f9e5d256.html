<h1>Dominik Kahun still sidelined by a concussion; Justin Schultz likely to return Friday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dominik Kahun, who remains in the NHL’s concussion protocol, is expected to sit out Friday’s game against the Philadelphia Flyers at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
<p>The Penguins winger suffered his concussion in the Jan. 19 win over the Boston Bruins, leaving that game in the second period. He did not play against the Flyers on Jan. 21, their final game before the NHL’s All-Star break.</p>
<p>Kahun was still not cleared to practice with the team in Cranberry on Thursday, the first after eight days off for the players. But coach Mike Sullivan said Kahun skated earlier in the day with skills development coach Ty Hennes.</p>
<p>“He’s still going through the concussion protocol,” he said. “That’s part of it. We’ll see how he responds. But the fact that he’s back on the ice suggests progress.”</p>
<p>Kahun was skating on Evgeni Malkin’s left wing at the time of his concussion. In 48 games, the 24-year-old has 10 goals, 17 assists and a plus-9 rating.</p>
<p>“It’s just another challenge that this team has been faced with,” Sullivan said of Kahun’s injury. “Dom’s played some real good games for us. He’s a real good player. He’s got good offensive instincts. He’s scored some big goals for us. So when a guy like that goes out of the lineup, someone else has to fill the void.”</p>
<p>With Kahun not practicing Thursday, Bryan Rust and Patric Hornqvist were the wingers on Malkin’s line. Rust, who leads the team with 21 goals, moved over to the left wing after thriving on the right side the past couple of months.</p>
<p>Jared McCann and Dominik Simon skated with Sidney Crosby on Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>Lafferty lingers in AHL</strong></p>
<p>With Kahun out and Nick Bjugstad still not ready to return, the Penguins on Thursday recalled on an emergency basis forwards Anthony Angello and Andrew Agozzino from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League.</p>
<p>Angello currently leads the AHL club with 16 goals, three of them game-winners. Agozzino has one point in nine games with the Penguins this season. The 29-year-old leads Wilkes-Barre/Scranton with 33 points and was named to the AHL’s All-Star game, though he did not play in that game this week.</p>
<p>It’s noteworthy that the Penguins picked those two over fellow forward Sam Lafferty, who was reassigned to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton last week. Sullivan said they wanted to find more playing time for the Hollidaysburg native.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old suited up for only five of Pittsburgh’s 11 games in January and averaged just under eight minutes of ice time per game in his last 15 games with the Penguins. Lafferty did not tally a point in any of those games.</p>
<p>“We have a responsibility to help the young players to continue to grow,” Sullivan said. “We just felt that at this point it would be best for Sam if he just goes down and he plays a lot of minutes, just give him an opportunity to play in a little bit of a different environment where the pressure isn’t quite as high.”</p>
<p><strong>Schultz likely to play</strong></p>
<p>Justin Schultz said he hopes to play Friday against the Flyers after he remained in Pittsburgh during the All-Star break to continue rehabbing his injury.</p>
<p>Schultz suffered a lower-body injury in the Dec. 17 win in Calgary. He first stepped back on the ice more than three weeks ago and had a full-contact practice with the Penguins on Jan. 20. The Penguins considered dressing Schultz a day later in their last game before the All-Star break but decided to hold him out.</p>
<p>“There’s no point in rushing it, obviously,” he said. “It’s still early enough where you want to make sure you’re 100% healthy and ready to go when I go in.”</p>
<p>If he goes in Friday, Juuso Riikola or Chad Ruhwedel will be a healthy scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Status quo for ‘Dumo’</strong></p>
<p>Sullivan gave a puzzled look when asked for an injury update on “Brian.”</p>
<p>“Brian Dumoulin,” he said after thinking about the question for a few seconds. “I usually don’t call him Brian. We call him ‘Dumo.’ So you stumped me there.”</p>
<p>Sullivan indicated that “Dumo,” who has been sidelined since Nov. 30, has yet to start skating. Friday marks exactly two months since the defenseman had surgery to repair lacerated tendons in his left ankle at UPMC Presbyterian. The Penguins said the day of the surgery that he would miss at least eight weeks.</p>
<p>Sullivan said Dumoulin, who had a team-best plus-17 rating when he got hurt, is “still participating in the off-ice aspect” of his rehab but is making progress.</p>
<p><strong>The captain on Kobe</strong></p>
<p>Crosby was asked Thursday about the death of Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant. The retired NBA star and his 13-year-old daughter, Gigi, were killed, along with seven others, in a helicopter crash outside L.A. on Sunday.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have the chance to meet him,” Crosby said.&nbsp;“I was shocked. I didn’t believe it when I first heard it. ... It’s just heartbreaking, for his family and all the families involved. He inspired so many people. He’s a legend, and I think you see the reaction and what he meant to people around the world.”</p>
