<h1>Pitt COVID-19 vaccine effort with partners in France, Austria seeks win for all of us</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just over a year before he and his colleagues at Institut Pasteur in France teamed up with Themis Bioscience in Austria and Dr. Paul Duprex and his team at the University of Pittsburgh to start the furious work of creating a possible vaccine to fight COVID-19, Dr. Frederic Tangy and two co-authors began a journal article with a prescient opening sentence.</p>
<p>“Infectious disease epidemics match wars and natural disasters in their capacity to threaten lives and damage economies,” <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457918300388?via%3Dihub#!" target="_blank">Dr. Tangy and his co-authors wrote in October 2018</a>. “Like SARS previously and Zika recently, the Ebola crisis in 2015 showed how vulnerable the world is to these epidemics, with over 11,000 people dying in the outbreak.”</p>
<p>They were not alone in their ability to predict what is now happening with the COVID-19 pandemic that has shut down much of the world and led to the deaths of more than 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Infectious disease experts for decades had feared that a new zoonotic disease — that is, a disease that jumps from animals to humans — with no known cure or vaccine, would grab hold of the world as labs and teams then scrambled to prevent global catastrophe.</p>
<p>It was because of that fear that Dr. Tangy invented the measles vector technology two decades ago to quickly create a safe vaccine during a pandemic —&nbsp;a decision his three-country team believes stands as good a chance as any <a href="https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank">of at least 44 projects worldwide</a>&nbsp;speeding to create a vaccine to inoculate the planet against SARS-CoV-2, the formal name of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>“It does seem to have a chance of working,” said Dr. Duprex, head of Pitt’s Center for Vaccine Research and&nbsp;— worth noting on the 65th anniversary of the discovery of the polio vaccine —&nbsp;who also holds the post as Pitt’s Jonas Salk Chair for Vaccine Research.</p>

<p>“Vaccines are slow enough for people who are ready to go,” he said. “But there’s no point in trying to start basic research on your favorite [vaccine platform] unless you have manufacturing capabilities, the ability to run clinical trials, the ability to do it quickly. And that’s what attracted me to doing this with Themis and Pasteur. Because at least this has a hope of this year getting into a phase 1 clinical trial.”</p>
<p><strong>Tweaking the vaccine</strong></p>
<p>The idea behind Dr. Tangy’s measles vector technology is that if the measles vaccine has been so successful in fighting measles in billions of people around the world, safely and cheaply inoculating people with lifelong immunity, then researchers should be able to tweak the measles vaccine to defend the human body against other viruses.</p>
<p>After finding what antigens in a non-measles virus cause the human body to mount an effective immune response, they then take those antigens and insert them into an existing measles vaccine, preparing the body to fight off the virus when it tries to infect a person.</p>
<p>“We have experience with this platform succeeding,” Dr. Tangy said. “We’ve developed a number of different vaccines using the platform — for HIV, malaria, chikungunya, Lassa fever, West Nile virus, MERS — and most were emerging at the moment we were working on them.”</p>
<p>Most of those proposed vaccines have been developed in conjunction with Themis, an 11-year-old biotech company that signed a licensing agreement in 2010 for Pasteur’s measles vector technology.</p>
<p>Their efforts over a decade have shown considerable promise, with the candidate vaccine for chikungunya — a virus spread by mosquitoes — recently going into phase 3 of human clinical trials, which means giving it to tens of thousands people after prior smaller studies showed it was effective and safe.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Dr. Tangy and his team at Pasteur <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682214000051" target="_blank">in 2014 published results </a>that showed that their measles vector technology managed to protect infected mice from the SARS virus in pre-clinical tests.&nbsp;That is important because SARS and COVID-19 are both caused by the coronavirus family.</p>
<p>“We have experience with SARS-CoV-1 [the virus that causes SARS], and we developed a candidate vaccine and tested it,” Dr. Tangy said. “But we did not make it to clinical trials because the virus disappeared and never came back again.”</p>
<p>That is the same explanation given by researchers around the world for not following through on research into not only a SARS vaccine, but a vaccine for MERS, another coronavirus that briefly had international public health experts worried it could cause a worldwide pandemic before the concern faded.</p>
<p>What is different now, of course, is that COVID-19 has not waned, and neither has the funding.</p>
<p>The team of Pasteur, Themis and Pitt won a $4.9 million grant last month from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, known as CEPI, one of seven COVID-19 vaccine grants CEPI has handed out so far.</p>
<p>Pitt became the third partner in this vaccine effort because of a prior connection with Dr. Duprex, who, as an expert on measles, joined Themis’ scientific advisory board four years ago.</p>
<p>CEPI was founded just three years ago to fund research into viruses that could do what COVID-19 has done: create a pandemic.</p>
<p>Just last year, CEPI funded Themis to begin research into a vaccine for MERS, and it <a href="https://www.themisbio.com/themis-bioscience-and-cepi-announce-initiation-of-phase-1-clinical-trial-with-lassa-fever-vaccine/" target="_blank">has done preclinical work on that</a>.</p>
<p>“It helps that we [Themis and Institut Pasteur] have worked together for quite some time on vaccines,” said Dr. Erich Tauber, co-founder and CEO of Themis. “We can build on what we have learned on SARS and MERS.”</p>
<p>With what is known already about COVID-19, “it looks like it could be an easier target for a vaccine than other” infectious diseases, he said.</p>
<p>For example, with malaria, Dr. Tauber said, “no one knew how to go at it,” and it took decades to develop vaccine candidates. “With coronavirus, there is a good understanding in the scientific community about what proteins should be targeted.”</p>
<p>The target in this case is the so-called spike of S protein that many other researchers are focused on in their vaccine efforts, including <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/04/02/Pitt-team-makes-progress-on-possible-COVID-19-vaccine/stories/202004020135" target="_blank">another team at Pitt that is using a different technology approach</a>.</p>
<p>The S protein would be taken from the virus; inserted into the measles vaccine; and then given first to animals — starting with mice and moving to monkeys — in preclinical trials and then to humans in three phases of clinical trials.</p>
<p>That is where the three-member partnership will pay off to speed up the process, the participants said.</p>
<p>Pasteur is the lead, with Dr. Christiane Gerke, head of vaccine programs at Pasteur, as the coordinator.</p>
<p>But while Pasteur and Themis have worked quickly to get, for example, a Zika vaccine candidate moving, Dr. Gerke said, “it still took 12 months to start clinical trials.”</p>
<p>“Now we hope to start clinical trials in June at the earliest,” she said, which would be about six months after they began.</p>
<p>“This development has to be much quicker than other developments,” Dr. Tauber said.</p>
<p>To speed that up, the preclinical work of researching the antigens and doing first safety studies in mice, then testing the candidate vaccine against the coronavirus in monkeys, will be split between Pasteur and Pitt. Pasteur will do the work with mice, and Pitt will do work with monkeys and antigen discovery.</p>
<p>During that time, Themis will be preparing to make, first, thousands of vaccine doses in its manufacturing facilities, and, later, potentially millions or billions.</p>
<p>After the preclinical trials developing animal models of the disease, next will come the phase 1 human trials.</p>
<p>“The whole of the team really wanted a phase 1 trial in the U.S., in Pittsburgh, and then a phase 1 in France. I would have loved to have been doing a phase 1 trial in this, and we have all the capabilities to do this,” Dr. Duprex said. “But CEPI has decided to run two trials and they’re gonna run both of them in Europe.”</p>
<p>There will be two phase 1 trials with 50 to 100 people, which determine it’s safe for people to take. They will be run in France and Belgium and overseen by Pasteur.</p>
<p>After that would be phase 2 trials involving hundreds of people who will be vaccinated against the disease to see if they can fight it off — a stage of the trial that could be done in Pittsburgh, Dr. Duprex said.</p>
<p>The phase 3 trials with thousands of people being vaccinated and then given the disease would follow, hopefully within 12 to 18 months, Dr. Tangy said.</p>
<p>That would be incredibly fast, said Dr. Tauber, who worries that “our friends in the media now are overpromising.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to overpromise that we can vaccinate the world in a few months. In a few months, we will be in clinical trials. But even that is very quick. No one has ever [created a vaccine] this quickly as we hope we will,” he said. “It is not difficult to make the vaccine itself — the difficulty is how quickly can we put this into humans safely.</p>
<p>“Your goal is to immunize a healthy person for his life. So you should not put risk into the vaccine that it is worse than the disease. That takes time.”</p>
<p><strong>Being a leader</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Duprex said while he’s working seemingly endless days, part of a leader’s job is to keep their team members who do the daily, grinding lab work healthy and alert — particularly when working with such a dangerous virus.</p>
<p>There is a “real pitch-in mentality at the moment,” he said. “But all the teams are being told that overscheduling and working long hours is not the right thing to do. What we do in a biocontainment lab is all risk-mitigation. The risk has to be negligible.”</p>
<p>And while they all are working furiously to solve the world’s worst pandemic since the 1918 Spanish flu, all three partners are watching and reading about other efforts to create a vaccine.</p>
<p>They can quickly recite problems they foresee with some of the other types of technology. Can other teams create enough DNA and protein quickly enough for those technologies to create a viable worldwide COVID-19 vaccine? Have any of those new technologies been tried in humans safely like the measles vaccine?</p>
<p>But they all see their role in this as just another “runner in the race,” as Dr. Duprex puts it.</p>
<p>“I honestly — and I’m not joking — I simply don’t care who wins, if winning is what people care about” in creating a vaccine, Dr. Duprex said. “I don’t care about winning. I care about somebody working on how to solve this problem. I don’t care if it’s a small molecule, an antibody or a vaccine. I’d love us to do something useful. But I don’t care. I want to be able to give something to my mother if she is in the hospital six years, six weeks or six months from now.”</p>
<p>Plus, he noted, for the all the incredible work Jonas Salk did creating the polio vaccine in 1955, “Salk is remembered. But all of us won.”</p>
