<h1>President Trump supporters hold Fourth of July boat parade, clash with counter-protesters on North Shore</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A flotilla of President Trump supporters held a parade down the Monongahela River on Saturday, drawing counter-protesters that demonstrated along the shore.</p>
<p>Organizers of the “4th of July Trump Boat Parade &amp; Salute To First Responders” said prior to the event that more than 12,000 people and 283 boats had signed up, though they were not sure how many would actually attend. Organizers decided that the event would take place despite Allegheny County’s prohibition against gatherings of more than 25 people, which the county announced Thursday in an attempt to control surging COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>The event was described online as “a Patriotic Trump Boat Parade &amp; MAGA Rally &amp; Salute to First Responders. All boats, cars, motorcycles, and folks of all ages are welcome to participate in the parade or cheering it along the river banks, the Point, North Shore, and Bridges along the route.”</p>
<p>About 30 boats appeared to take part as the parade got underway on Saturday.</p>
<p>The two groups met on the North Shore around 1 p.m. and at times confronted each other across the Riverwalk, “Trump 2020” shirts on one side and “Black Lives Matter” shirts on the other.</p>
<p>At one point, counter-protesters complained that police treated the Black Lives Matters protesters more aggressively than the Trump supporters.</p>
