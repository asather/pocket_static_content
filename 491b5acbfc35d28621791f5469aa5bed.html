<h1>Pitt's 2020 optimism built around pass rush and secondary. But what about linebackers?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was too early to tell last Friday how Pitt's linebackers were progressing through the early stages of spring ball. The Panthers’ third of 15 practices was the team's first in full pads, and Pat Narduzzi, chatting after an up-tempo session, said he needed to watch the tape for a fuller picture.</p>
<p>But whatever Narduzzi saw on film over the weekend really only matters to a certain degree.</p>
<p>The Panthers are a few days into this thing. They’re six months from the start of the season. Redshirt senior linebacker Chase Pine even said himself last August that “spring ball honestly doesn't mean anything,” adding that fall camp is “where you really stamp your name down.” It's true that depth charts are rarely written in permanent marker in spring camp.</p>
<p>At the very least, though, Narduzzi has an idea of what he's looking for when he sits down to grade his linebackers this month. He, defensive coordinator Randy Bates and linebackers coach Rob Harley know what they want from that unit in 2020 — what they need from it for Pitt's defense to make good on the “unfinished business” it preached throughout the offseason.</p>
<p>In the Panthers' perfect world, Cam Bright continues shining at the “Star” outside position, Phil Campbell adjusts to playing “Money” full-time opposite Bright, and Pine finds steadiness in the middle. Ideally for Narduzzi, all three upperclassmen start and work in unison to bridge the gap between a seasoned secondary and perhaps the ACC's best defensive line. And, critically, Pine and Campbell are confident in the linebackers' ability to hold their own.</p>
<p>“Everyone's talking about the safeties and the D-linemen. You know, they're really good guys. But we've got a solid group of linebackers,” Pine said last week. “We've got guys who have been playing with each other for a long time. ... I think this will be a good year for the linebackers.”</p>
<p>“We have a lot of chemistry, a lot of speed. We know what we're doing. And we play off the D-line, and the safeties play off us,” Campbell added. “So everyone's together.”</p>
<p>And yet, it's easy to understand how Pine and Campbell might feel overlooked.</p>
<p>Jaylen Twyman and Patrick Jones II came back, Rashad Weaver and Keyshon Camp returned from injury, and guys like Deslin Alexandre, Haba Baldonado and John Morgan are pushing for attention on a front four that helped Pitt finish 2019 tied for first in sacks per game nationally. In the secondary, the hometown hype around Paris Ford and Damar Hamlin is undeniable.</p>
<p>None of this is new. That front-back combo has been the driving force behind Pitt's offseason optimism.</p>
<p>But linebacker? Bright's name has barely been out there despite 62 tackles and nine TFLs at "Star," Pitt's space-eating linebacker spot. Few have mentioned Campbell, whose speed as a former safety allowed him to rack up 56 tackles and 5.5 sacks last season, fifth among returning ACC linebackers. And Pine, well, he has the talent. He just hasn’t shown on a consistent basis that he’s ready (yet) to fill Saleem Brightwell's shoes.</p>
<p>"One play he'll look like an All American. One play it'll be like, 'What are you doing?'" Narduzzi said. "If he stays consistent, he can be a freaking big-time NFL middle linebacker. Period. ... We've got a lot of faith in what Chase can do. It's just doing it all the time, not just doing it sometimes. I don't like those sometimes guys."</p>
<p>Pine, though, has the unwavering belief of his teammates, specifically Campbell.</p>
<p>Campbell said last week that communication is the most important part of a cohesive defense. Pine, standing next to his roommate, chimed in. “Confidence, too,” Pine said. “Confidence knowing that your guy is going to do his job, you're going to do your job. It's like one big fit.”</p>
<p>Campbell agreed, noting that he knows Pine has his back on the field. “When I fill my gap, he's filling his,” Campbell added. “I think that really matters, just knowing what we're doing now with all this experience.”</p>

<p>Campbell, specifically, has had quite an experience so far at Pitt. The New Jersey native, who started his career at safety, played primarily at “Star” last season and seems ready to take the mantle at “Money” from departed grad transfer Kylan Johnson. Campbell, who also recorded two forced fumbles and a pick last season, put on a bit of weight to adjust to yet another role in spring ball, beefing up to 225 pounds to handle the boundary linebacker responsibilities.</p>
<p>Campbell said he is “grateful” for his journey throughout the defense's second level. Now he's familiar with what's going on behind him and in front of him. There's an inherent understanding, a connection between the front four and the back end.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the 2020 season, that knowledge should help Campbell and the linebackers hold up their end of the defense's high expectations — and maybe have a little fun doing it.</p>
<p>“It's excitement,” Campbell said with a smile, when asked whether the unit is feeling any pressure to perform this upcoming season. “Last year we had pressure. We're on a roll now.”</p>
