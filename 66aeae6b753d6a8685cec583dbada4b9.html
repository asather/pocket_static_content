<h1>Walmart to expand hours after limiting them due to COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Walmart is expanding its hours this week after limiting them in March due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>The world’s largest retailer announced Monday that more than 4,000 of its 4,700 Walmart stores will expand their closing time from 8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Walmart stores will host a senior shopping hour — starting one hour before the stores usually open — on Tuesdays for customers age 60 and older who may be more vulnerable to COVID-19. Pharmacies and vision centers will also be open during this time.</p>
<p>“We’ll continue assessing our remaining stores to determine the right time to expand their closing hours,” the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said. “With this change, we will continue the health and safety measures currently in place, such as social distancing, health screenings, plastic barriers at the registers and masks.”</p>
<p>Many major grocers had adjusted their hours in response to high demand to allow time to restock shelves and sanitize stores, while following social-distancing guidelines handed down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Locally, Walmart stores that have expanded hours include locations in Frazer, the Natrona Heights section of Harrison, West Mifflin, Carnegie, Bethel Park, Cranberry, and Butler.&nbsp;</p>
