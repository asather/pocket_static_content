<h1>Findlay files suit against county over Pittsburgh International Airport's water supply</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Findlay Township Municipal Authority has filed suit in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court to order the county to buy its water and sewer services from Findlay for areas of Pittsburgh International Airport within the township.</p>
<p>“We simply want the county and its airport authority to comply with state law,” said Jason Orsini, general manager of the Findlay authority, in a statement announcing the suit. “The legislature has made it clear that there should be one and only one provider of water and sewer service in each jurisdiction. And it’s very clear, the airport terminal is in Findlay Township.”</p>
<p>The airport straddles the border between Findlay and Moon. Moon has been providing water and sewer service to the airport under a series of agreements Mr. Orsini said are no longer in effect or that Findlay does not intend to renew when they expire within the next six months.</p>
<p>Defendants in the suit are the county, the airport authority and Moon.</p>
<p>Mr. Orsini said the county and the airport authority have refused to negotiate with Findlay. The county has indicated it is free to choose its own suppliers, Mr. Orsini said.</p>
<p>“If Allegheny County were permitted to shop around for its water and sewer services at the international airport, what’s to prevent it from doing the same at the county airport, or at any of its community college campuses and facilities,” Mr. Orsini said. “For that matter, what’s to prevent a private company or organization from doing the same.”</p>
<p>He said that if Pennsylvania allows shopping for water and sewer services, residents across the state could be burdened with redundant resources and potentially higher use rates.</p>
<p>The county said it does not comment on litigation.</p>
