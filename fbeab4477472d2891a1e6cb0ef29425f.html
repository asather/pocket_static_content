<p>HARRISBURG — A task force set up three years ago issued recommendations Wednesday about how to improve the process of reentering outside society for prisoners who have finished their sentences.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Reentry Council’s report addresses housing, work, health, education and other challenges that former inmates face upon release from incarceration.</p>
<p>The group says re-entry coalitions are currently in 30 of the 67 counties but should be established across the state. It is calling for all prisons and jails to hire re-entry counselors, as the Department of Corrections has done.</p>
<p>It urges lawmakers to fund a program to provide state-issued identification to all inmates upon release, expanding to counties an effort that’s currently done in state prisons with assistance from the Transportation Department.</p>
<p>The report describes the barriers former prisoners can face in finding a place to live and urges all correctional facilities to help those who are eligible to obtain medical benefits before they get out, so that health care will not be interrupted.</p>
<p>The task force said employers would benefit from getting more guidance about hiring former prisoners and suggested more of them stop asking job applicants about their criminal histories.</p>
<p>The council also addressed how families adapt when loved ones return as former inmates, endorsing the wider use of peer mentoring and better financial support for child care.</p>
