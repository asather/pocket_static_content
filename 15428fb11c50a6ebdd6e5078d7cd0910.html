<h1>Pirates' top pick Gonzales has traveled unique path</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>From walk-on to college star, from the Western Athletic Conference to the Cape Cod League, Nick Gonzales has had to prove himself time and time again.</p>
<p>The good news for the Pirates’ first-round draft choice is that he’s actually grown quite comfortable showing everyone he belongs, regardless of what trait or qualification seems to be in doubt.</p>
<p>It's one of the primary reasons why the Pirates had zero hesitation making the New Mexico State shortstop their No. 7 overall pick Wednesday, dropping into their system a player with a stellar attitude, as well as someone who profiles as an excellent major league hitter.</p>
<p>The crazy part for Gonzales, 21, is that he was barely an NCAA Division I baseball player. Now, he's a top-10 pick and high-level prospect. He was actually a walk-on for the Aggies before adding 15 pounds of muscle and slashing .347/.425/.596 in 57 games as a freshman, finally earning that coveted scholarship.</p>
<p>“It’s incredible for me,” Gonzales said. “To see where I was a few years ago, worried about traveling and making the team, worried about getting a scholarship to be here now, you see all the players ahead of you, you see all the players who are around you, it’s just super incredible.”</p>
<p>Gonzales’ average as a freshman led the team. His slugging percentage led the team and conference. For his efforts, Gonzales was named the WAC freshman of the year and was a first-team all-conference pick.</p>
<p>The next year, Gonzales continued to thrive at the plate, leading the nation in batting average (.432) and picking up several postseason awards. He was named an All-American by six different publications.</p>
<p>But even with his gaudy offensive numbers, questions dogged Gonzales. About the competition. About the elevation at New Mexico State’s home park (about 4,000 feet above sea level). About his size (5-10, 190 pounds). About his arm strength (potentially suspect for a shortstop).</p>
<p>Gonzales rendered those queries meaningless by what he did in the summer of 2019, when he tore up the prestigious Cape Cod League. Switching over to wood was no issue for the baseball junkie, his first swing resulting in a home run.</p>
<p>“It was smooth sailing after that first hit,” Gonzales said.</p>
<p>In 42 games, Gonzales hit .351 with 14 doubles, four triples, seven home runs and 33 RBIs. The questions seemed to subside. Apparently, Gonzales was actually good at baseball, not the product of poor competition or thin air.</p>
<p>As a junior, it seemed COVID-19 was the only thing capable of stopping Gonzales, who led the nation in home runs (12), runs scored (28), RBIs (36) and total bases (67) before the pandemic shut things down.</p>
<p>As Gonzales focused on turning pro, it was impossible not to reflect on the walk-on story or what he did in the Cape Cod League, proving he was a legitimate hitting prospect.</p>
<p>It also offered Gonzalez time to dig into some of his ridiculous numbers, although the soft-spoken infielder — who played second base as a freshman and sophomore — doesn’t seem like the type to do such a thing.</p>
<p>Gonzales finished his college career with a .502 on-base percentage. He once hit five home runs in a doubleheader and actually finished college with a streak of 82 consecutive games where he reached base safely.</p>
<p>Known for his ability to make adjustments, terrific eye and quick hands, Gonzales has the rare distinction of leaving college with more walks (89) than strikeouts (79).</p>
<p>“I really like to let the ball get deep in the zone and see it longer,” Gonzales said. “I trust my quick hands and let the barrel work. Then also having a good plan getting into the box is a big thing for me.”</p>
<p>Gonzales doesn’t know a ton about the Pirates. His first communication with the front office was choppy because he said he doesn’t get great cell service at home in Vail, Ariz. Kevin Newman and Cole Tucker — a pair of Arizona natives — are players Gonzales likes watching, but he otherwise doesn’t have any hooks into his new organization.</p>
<p>If any Pirates fans are looking to feel old, Gonzales said he’s an especially big fan of Andrew McCutchen.</p>
<p>“Andrew McCutchen was one of my favorite players growing up, watching him play and run down balls in center field,” Gonzales said. “I think he wore the black and yellow really good.”</p>
<p>The Pirates made the smart pick here by taking the best player available, someone with a sterling reputation and a hard worker who’s impossible not to like. Gonzales should also ascend through the minor leagues rather quickly because of his makeup and advanced skill set.</p>
<p>The difficult part for Gonzales honestly might be finding some sort of ax to grind. He’s thrived his entire life on adversity, people telling him that something couldn’t be done.</p>
<p>Perhaps the next obstacle becomes something like the Pirates’ logjam of middle infielders — Liover Peguero, Oneil Cruz, Newman and Tucker. Or that some undersized former walk-on from WAC couldn’t possibly make this look easy again, could he?</p>
<p>“I enjoy playing baseball so much that I want to play it for a very long time,” Gonzales said. “I know that if I want to do that, I’m going to have to put the work in to be the best player I can be.”</p>
