<h1>Breaking down the Pirates’ 30-man roster in 30 thoughts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates on Thursday afternoon set and released their 30-man roster, a necessary step for opening day for all 30 MLB clubs. Many of the moves were expected, although a couple were not.</p>
<p>Without any sort of delay, let’s break this down via 30 thoughts:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> While the roster isn’t going to make any of the Pirates’ NL Central opponents think twice about showing up for a game, it does have one intended consequence: There’s opportunity here.</p>
<p>“I think our strength is that we've got a group of young players, both on the position player side and the pitching side, who are in the upward arc of their career,” general manager Ben Cherington said. “So we expect that means we will continue to see improvement over time. I think we're already seeing some of that in spring training, relative to March. We've seen guys take a step forward. We expect that will continue.”</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Procedurally speaking, the Pirates transferred Chris Archer, Kevin Kramer, Luke Maile and Jameson Taillon to the 45-day injured list, opening spots on the 40-man roster.</p>
<p>They also recalled JT Brubaker, Jason Martin and Cole Tucker.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Phillip Evans, Derek Holland and Nik Turley made the team as non-roster invitees, and none them came as a surprise. Same goes for Robbie Erlin and John Ryan Murphy previously.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> And utility man JT Riddle was placed on the 10-day injured list (retroactive to July 20) with a right abdomen strain.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Now that we got the news out of the way, the outfield was an interesting decision for a couple reasons.</p>
<p>One, Cherington said Gregory Polanco — who’s out with COVID-19 and was not on the 30-man roster — will return “sooner rather than later.” Polanco’s return could make this moot, but it was telling that the Pirates chose Martin over Socrates Brito.</p>
<p>For one, Martin was in Altoona, meaning management saw Brito much more than it did Martin. And maybe that was why the Pirates chose Martin, whose speed and defense gives Shelton a couple more options.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> It’ll be interesting to see how Shelton uses Martin. Sounds like he could be a popular option to pinch-run late in games.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Evans is extremely well-liked by the Pirates, even if he isn’t someone who is going to command a ton of attention.</p>
<p>A big part of that has been his recent power increase, but there’s also a consistent theme with the Pirates roster that tracks with Evans: He can play several different positions.</p>
<p>“From both a team and individual development perspective, I would say versatility is and will continue to be important,” Cherington said.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> More than a third of the roster is new, which is pretty much how it should be for a team coming off a 69-win season.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Player development-wise, another piece of news involves Blake Cederlind, the hard-throwing righty reliever who also had COVID-19.</p>
<p>Cederlind has been cleared and is headed to Altoona to start a throwing program. You’ll see him in Pittsburgh this summer.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Geoff Hartlieb and Sam Howard seemed like intriguing options not long ago. However, they spent most of spring training 2.0 in Altoona, far away from ever making the 30-man.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> Back to the outfield … there’s a chance, even with Polanco in there, for this group to be better defensively.</p>
<p>Jarrod Dyson has been smooth in center, his routes to balls a stark upgrade over Starling Marte, even though he might not throw as well. Bryan Reynolds is steady in left, and Guillermo Heredia does enough in right.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> It’s worth noting that the Pirates will have to trim their roster down to 28 in two weeks. Which two will go? Impossible to say. Performance and health will dictate.</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> The Pirates kept 16 pitchers, which will likely break down to six starters and 10 in the bullpen, with one of those 10 (Brubaker) reserved for long-man duty in case of an injury, a surprise positive test or someone getting blown up early.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> Working backward … Kyle Crick, Nick Burdi, Richard Rodriguez, Michael Feliz, Chris Stratton, Erlin … then Clay Holmes, Dovydas Neverauskas, Turley and Brubaker.</p>
<p>The exhibition games were frustrating, sure, but it only matters if it happens in the regular season. We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> Holmes and Turley are interesting, as they’ve looked surprisingly good this spring. They should get some opportunities in lower-leverage situations, but they have the stuff to get outs.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> The Pirates’ first taxi squad can fit comfortably inside of one vehicle: It’s just catcher Andrew Susac, who will travel with the team to St. Louis.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> How and when Riddle returns should be interesting. Cherington said he’s been “feeling this for a few days,” and they made this move because they didn’t think they could count on getting anything out of Riddle.</p>
<p>OK, fine. Would imagine Riddle gets a spot when he’s ready, but who he boots out might be interesting. Evans and Erik Gonzalez do similar stuff.</p>
<p><strong>18.</strong> Don’t expect Keone Kela to start facing hitters immediately when he returns.</p>
<p>Cherington said that while they’ve been monitoring his throwing and have been encouraged by what he’s been doing, Kela has not faced major league hitters since March. There were will be some sort of “progression” toward that happening once he’s cleared.</p>
<p><strong>19.</strong> Managing-wise, there are clues that Shelton plans to be aggressive on the bases. For one, Cherington said so Friday.</p>
<p>But it’s also how this team is constructed. Dyson is a threat to steal. They’ve been working with Reynolds to run more. Martin excels in that area. Should be exciting.</p>
<p><strong>20.</strong> Speaking of Reynolds, you can expect him to bat second and Adam Frazier to hit third. With Josh Bell in the cleanup spot and Colin Moran the likely No. 5 hitter until Polanco returns, it’s hard to imagine the Pirates dropping Kevin Newman that low.</p>
<p>Look for Newman to lead off and for Dyson to serve as a second leadoff guy lower in the order.</p>
<p><strong>21.</strong> When Cederlind and Ke’Bryan Hayes return to Pittsburgh — and maybe someone like Will Craig, too — will be a big story line this season.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting to think about how the Pirates will evaluate these guys, considering there’s no minor league season and games will only be against each other.</p>
<p><strong>22.</strong> Cherington said they’ll use high-speed video, incorporating Rapsodo and Trackman, and the GM said he didn’t worry about intrasquad games being a substitute for real action.</p>
<p>“We have professional pitchers facing professional hitters in Altoona,” Cherington said. “We can measure all the things pretty much that we would in a normal minor league game. Then we can also measure it subjectively through the eyes of our coaches and get that feedback, as well. It’s different, but really looking at some of the same information. We just don’t have a box score at the end of the night.”</p>
<p><strong>23.</strong> We’ve talked so much about Chad Kuhl and Edgar Santana rehabbing from Tommy John surgery at Pirate City. Well, Turley was there, too, recovering from his own TJ.</p>
<p>I’m not convinced with Erlin as the top left-handed option here. Have frankly been more impressed with Turley.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>24.</strong> Shelton pushing for Martin, as he did, should tell us two things, and they’re related: The manager has influence over this roster, and the GM is smart enough to allow that to happen.</p>
<p><strong>25.</strong> No mention of the starting pitchers because they were pretty much set, and I understand why people are going to be critical of them.</p>
<p>But I agree with what Holland said Wednesday: They’re going to surprise some people. These guys were not very well-prepared last season, and it was evident in their performance.</p>
<p><strong>26.</strong> Much as I like each one of them, I could see the Pirates having four legitimate trade candidates by the trade deadline … which, uh, is only a little more than a month away.</p>
<p>Holland, Dyson, Frazier and potentially Kela could fetch something in return, which could fit well into the Pirates’ long-term plan.</p>
<p><strong>27.</strong> The Pirates’ catching situation is … not terrible. Stallings is very good defensively. Cherington and Shelton have liked what John Ryan Murphy has done fine thus far.</p>
<p>In terms of issues facing the Pirates right now, I don’t see this being a gigantic one.</p>
<p><strong>28.</strong> At third base, watch how the reps are split come midseason. I think they want and need to take a look at Hayes, but I can also see Moran having a surprisingly good year.</p>
<p>Who plays more? I think it’ll be Moran, but it could be an interesting situation if Moran produces.</p>
<p><strong>29.</strong> I don’t see the Brault-Kuhl piggyback sticking for too terribly long. Something will happen. Always does. Either someone won’t perform or there will be some other need.</p>
<p><strong>30.</strong> This was a good quote to hear from Cherington: “There will always be a balance, but we have no fears certainly of calling up a young player and relying on him.”</p>
<p>How it should be, of course, with Hayes, Cederlind, Craig, Ponce, Bolton, whomever. If the Pirates are going to win 26 games — many projections have them around there — then they need to lose 34 of 60 in a productive manner.</p>
