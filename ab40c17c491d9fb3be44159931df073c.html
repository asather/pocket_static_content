<h1>Injured Brian Dumoulin, Nick Bjugstad traveling on Penguins road trip is 'encouraging'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The team charter will be a little more crowded on this upcoming road trip.</p>
<p>Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said Saturday that injured players Brian Dumoulin, Nick Bjugstad and John Marino would all travel with the team for a week-long trip that starts Sunday in Washington and ends in San Jose six days later.</p>
<p>“That’s encouraging,” he said before Saturday’s home game against Buffalo.</p>
<p>Dumoulin was injured in an odd collision during the Nov. 30 loss in St. Louis. A day later, on Dec. 1, he had surgery at UPMC Presbyterian to repair lacerated tendons in his left ankle. The team said then that he would miss at least eight weeks.</p>
<p>Dumoulin has more frequently been spotted at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex the past two weeks. Sullivan said the steady defenseman stepped back onto the ice early last week and he has continued to skate on an individual basis.</p>
<p>Sullivan said that getting Dumoulin, a vocal team leader and the locker room disk jockey, back into the mix has provided the Penguins with energy.</p>
<p>“He’s really emerged as one of the leaders of the group,” the coach said. “I know how well liked he is and respected he is by his teammates and his coaches. So whenever he’s around the team, I think it’s a win-win for everybody.”</p>
<p>He added with a grin: “It also suggests that he’s getting closer to his return.”</p>
<p>At the time of his injury, the 6-foot-4 blue-liner led the team with a plus-17 rating, was third among Penguins in blocked shots and seventh in hits. He is one of their best penalty-killers and was on pace for a second straight 20-point season.</p>
<p>Bjugstad has not played since Nov. 15. The big center underwent core muscle surgery a few days later. The Penguins estimated then that he would be out at least eight weeks. He had been skating in mid-January but the brakes got pumped on that for undisclosed reasons. He got back on the ice several days ago.</p>
<p>Bjugstad has played just 10 games this season, putting up just one point. In 32 games with the Penguins last season, he tallied nine goals and 14 points.</p>
<p>Marino has been sidelined since taking a slap shot to his left cheek Feb. 6. The rookie blue-liner had surgery to repair broken bones in his face Feb. 10.</p>
<p>Jim Rutherford recently told the Post-Gazette that the Penguins expected this weekend to get injury updates on those players that would help the GM decide if he wanted to make another deal before Monday’s trade deadline.</p>
<p>Asked Saturday if those three players traveling to D.C. and out to California meant that the team had indeed gotten good news, Sullivan played coy.</p>
<p>“It’s not even news for us,” Sullivan said. “That is just the process.”</p>
<p><strong>Murray likely to start Sunday</strong></p>
<p>Tristan Jarry was between the pipes Saturday when the Penguins hosted the Sabres at PPG Paints Arena. Given Sullivan’s recent handling of his goalies, the expectation is Murray will face the Washington Capitals on Sunday.</p>
<p>Murray was in goal against them on Super Bowl Sunday. In one of his best games of the season, he made 29 saves in a 4-3 victory at Capital One Arena.</p>
<p>Since the NHL’s Christmas break, Murray is 7-2-1 with a .921 save percentage. He gave up four goals in Thursday’s shutout loss in Toronto. A day earlier, goalie coach Mike Buckley praised Murray for his ability to bounce back.</p>
<p>“He’s really good at staying on track of what he needs to do. He has a good understanding that things aren’t always going to go your way,” Buckley said. “It’s more about how you react. That’s a strength of his that he’s always had.”</p>
<p><strong>Kahun sits out against Sabres</strong></p>
<p>Dominik Kahun did not play Saturday, two days after he was hit hard by a shot in his left knee in the Toronto loss and had to be helped off the ice. Kahun, who missed Friday’s practice, took part in pregame warmups Saturday. But afterward the Penguins decided to hold the hobbled winger out of the lineup.</p>
<p>With Kahun out, rookie forward Anthony Angello returned to the lineup and Patric Hornqvist got bumped up to Kahun’s spot on Evgeni Malkin’s line.</p>
<p>The Penguins again made defenseman Zach Trotman a healthy scratch.</p>
