<p>The Allegheny County Health Department has ordered two area eateries to close because they were operating without health permits.</p>
<p>They include KeKe Kitchen in the Garfield section of the city, and Bella’s Smokin’ BBQ, a mobile food truck operating on William Penn Highway in Monroeville.</p>
<p>Bella’s also was cited for several food safety violations, including holding food at unsafe temperatures and an insufficient potable water supply.</p>
