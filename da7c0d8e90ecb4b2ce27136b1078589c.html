<h1>Pittsburgh-area clergy to host commemoration for victims of 2015 S.C. church shooting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An interracial and&nbsp;interfaith group of Pittsburgh-area clergy on Wednesday evening will be holding a 30-minute remote observance of the fifth anniversary of the massacre of nine African Americans at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., by a white supremacist.</p>
<p>The program, titled “Witness,” commemorates the victims and others killed in racist violence, and it includes a renewed commitment to anti-racist action.</p>
<p>Because of the pandemic, the program will be streamed beginning 7 p.m. at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/WelcomeHome724." target="_blank">www.facebook.com/WelcomeHome724.</a></p>
<p>Nine people were killed at a Bible study at Mother Emanuel on June 17, 2015, by an avowed white supremacist now on death row.</p>
<p>To begin the event, participants are invited to go outside and make noise, such as by banging pots, ringing bells, or blasting shofars, to invite neighbors to gather. Some churches, such as First Lutheran Church, Downtown, will ring their bells.</p>
<p>The video presentation will include remarks from Bishop Frank Madison Reid III, presiding prelate of the Third Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and Bishop Kurt Kusserow of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.</p>
<p>Local clergy will read the names of those who have died as a result of racist violence, from the time of slavery to the present day, then share a call to action to dismantle racism.</p>
<p>Participants include Christian Associates of Southwest Pennsylvania, Homewood AME Zion Church, St. Mary Magdalene Lutheran Episcopal Church, Trinity AME Zion Church, Congregation Beth Shalom and Tree of Life / Or L’Simcha Congregation.</p>
