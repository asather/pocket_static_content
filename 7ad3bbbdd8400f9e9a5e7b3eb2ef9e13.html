<h1>Fishing Report: Fishing slow, state schedules trout stocking </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>State Fish and Boat Commission trout stocking schedules for 2020 were posted this week at <a href="/fishandboat.com" target="_blank">fishandboat.com</a>. Regional stockings are set to begin in March.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County) All of the tribs were fishable, though waters were low on a few small creeks and Elk remained a little high with snowmelt. With no ice on the bay, anglers caught yellow perch and crappies from shore. Snow was expected over the region Friday with clear or partly cloudy skies Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Pymatuning Reservoir</strong> (Crawford County) Crappies and perch were taken using live bait under bobbers fishing from shore.</p>
<p><strong>Raccoon Lake</strong> (Beaver County) A few anglers were seen fishing near the dam early in the week.</p>
<p><strong>North Park Lake</strong> (Allegheny County) A few disappointed ice fishermen threw baits and bobbers from shore trying to reach rainbow trout stocked by the Fish and Boat Commission in December.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio River</strong> (Allegheny County) Anglers drifting live bait from shore picked up a few walleye.</p>
<p><strong>Chartiers Creek</strong> (Allegheny County) Taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather, anglers rigged with live minnows caught bass.</p>
<p><strong>Montour Run</strong> (Allegheny County) A few trout were taken.</p>
<p><strong>Deer Creek</strong> (Allegheny County) Trout-stocked waters were extended about one-third mile downstream to below the Rich Hill Road bridge. A state stocking was expected March 3.</p>
<p><strong>Donegal Lake</strong> (Westmoreland County) Following dam repair, the impoundment has a new launching ramp. Temporary regulations require immediate release of all fish except trout, which will be stocked March 1 and managed under typical commonwealth inland water rules.</p>
