<h1>New Monmouth poll shows Biden surging in Pa.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Seizing an advantage among middle-aged voters and those in swing counties, as well as solidifying his support with voters of color, Democrat Joe Biden has surged back to a 12-point lead in Pennsylvania, according to a new poll released by Monmouth University on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, the former vice president, leads&nbsp;President Donald Trump 54% to 42% less than a month from the election, <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_pa_100620/" target="_blank">the poll found</a>.</p>
<p>Half of the survey’s 500 interviews with registered voters were conducted before Mr. Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19, and half after. The poll found little difference in the results, the pollster noted.</p>
<p>“If any recent event moved the needle it was more likely last week’s debate than the president’s Covid diagnosis,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, in a statement. “What seems to be more important than either event, though, is voters’ focus on which candidate they trust more on the issues that keep them up at night.”</p>
<p>The survey showed that voters trust Mr. Biden more on handling the COVID-19 pandemic (52% to 32%), keeping health care affordable and accessible (48% to 34%) and — on an issue the president has made a main pillar of his re-election campaign —&nbsp;handling law and order (45% to 41%). Voters trust Mr. Trump more to create jobs and strengthen the economy, 44% to 39%.</p>
<p>“Trump may be strongest on jobs and the economy but that seems to be an issue that is farther down the list of things that keep Pennsylvanians up at night,” Mr. Murray said. “On the other hand, an issue he has successfully elevated in the debate — law and order — may actually be helping his opponent more.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s numbers improved in several demographics and geographical areas. Middle-aged voters 50 to 64 years old — which Mr. Trump was leading, 54% to 45% a month ago — are now in Mr. Biden’s camp, 54% to 45%. His lead among voters of color — 72% to 15% a month ago — is now 83% to 16%,&nbsp;“mainly by moving many of them from being&nbsp;‘undecided’ over the past month,” according to the pollster.</p>
<p><strong>The full Monmouth University poll findings:</strong></p>
<p>In 10 swing counties where Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton were separated by less than 10 points in 2016, Mr. Biden leads 53% to 42%. Mr. Trump led 46% to 44% in these counties a month ago.</p>
<p>And in the counties where Ms. Clinton won decisively in 2016 — including Allegheny County — Mr. Biden is in front 77% to 20%, compared to 65% to 30% a month ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump continues to lead by a wide margin — 22 points — in counties he won handily in 2016, but he carried those counties by 34 points then.</p>
<p>The new poll also showed Democrats continuing to hold an advantage in statewide races, with Attorney General Josh Shapiro leading by 15 points over Republican Heather Heidelbaugh (up from 10 points), incumbent Treasurer Joe Torsella beating Republican Stacy Garrity by 6 (up from 5) and Democrat Nina Ahmad leading Republican Tim DeFoor by 6 (up from 2) in the open race for auditor general.</p>
