<h1>Teddy Ruffner, Mars score late to edge Highlands</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mars was in deep trouble Friday night against Highlands.</p>
<p>With less than two minutes to go, the Fightin’ Planets trailed by one and faced a fourth-and-17 on the Rams 44.</p>
<p>To that point, Mars had struggled to throw the ball. Their quarterback, Quinn Fuller, was just 6 for 16 with 41 yards and two interceptions. When the Fightin’ Planets needed him most, though, he came through.</p>
<p>Fuller took the snap, rolled to his right, stopped, looked back to his left and hurled the ball deep to wideout Anthony Vargo, who secured it and ran to the Highlands 5.</p>
<p>Mars running back Teddy Ruffner punched it in three players later, thanks to a huge push from his offensive line, and the Fightin’ Planets prevailed, 12-7.</p>
<p>The Rams (1-1) tried to mount a rally after Mars scored with just 49.3 seconds left, but a third-down interception ended it quickly, and Mars (2-0) held on for the win.</p>
<p>“We played well enough to win the football game,” Mars coach Scott Heinauer said. “We did some good things. Defensively, I thought our kids played well. … We talked at halftime, I said, ‘There are going to be some big plays that are going to have to be made, and you know what, we made a big fourth-down play, and we made a big play at the end there.”</p>
<p>Ruffner’s production was thought to be the key heading into the game, and the first signs were promising.</p>
<p>On the opening kickoff, Highlands kicker/wide receiver D.J. Loveland seemed to do a good job of avoiding Ruffner. He sailed the ball off to the left, bouncing away from the star returner, down to the 3. Ruffner scooped it up anyways, cut left, knifed through the middle of Highland’ kickoff team and took it 97 yards to give Mars a 6-0 lead.</p>
<p>Highlands certainly was aware of Mars’ largest threat, though. After Ruffner torched Hampton with 254 yards on the ground last week, he was limited to 86, with most of that coming in the first quarter.</p>
<p>“We were one play away from probably the best defensive effort I’ve ever seen in my life,” Highlands coach Dom Girardi said. “That doesn’t take away the defensive effort that happened tonight, right? They’re a good team. They’re a tough team.”</p>
<p>Really, the Rams simply ran into their own mistakes.</p>
<p>They ended up with double-digit penalties, many of which came on would-be big plays. Running back Brock White ran for 125 yards on 28 carries, but he fumbled twice in big situations.</p>
<p>The first time, Highlands had the ball inside Mars 20, trailing 6-0. White popped his way down to the 13 on a run to the right, but lost the football, and the Fightin’ Planets recovered.</p>
<p>He made up for it in the third quarter, catching a 9-yard pass on a wheel route from the backfield that tied thesvcore, with the extra point making it 7-6.</p>
<p>The second fumble was even more costly, though. After Mars had a potential go-ahead 32-yard field goal blocked, Highlands took over at their 22. On a third-and-2, White carried the ball over the first-down marker, but again lost the ball. The Planets had just one timeout remaining at the time, and the Rams would have had a good opportunity to seal the game.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you can ask for anymore in a defense, really. It was phenomenal,” Girardi said. “And offensively, we had success moving the ball, but it’s hard to sustain drives against good teams if you’re constantly behind the sticks or you’re making mistakes.”</p>
<p>It took a while for Mars to capitalize on those mistakes, but it eventually did, sealing a tightly contested battle that could loom large in the WPIAL Class 4A Greater Allegheny Conference.</p>
