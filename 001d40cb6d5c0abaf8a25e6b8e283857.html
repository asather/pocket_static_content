<h1>Ross Township commissioners agree to purchase security cameras</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ross Township commissioners have unanimously agreed to spend $9,450 to purchase security cameras from Gordico Inc.on McKnight Road for Sangree, Seville and Mayer parks.</p>
<p>Electrical work must be done in Sangree and Mayer before the cameras can be installed, said Eloise Peet, parks and recreation director.</p>
<p>Ms. Peet said the township also had to spend $900 to fix a bridge in Mayer Park that was damaged by vandalism.</p>
<p>In other business, Commissioner Dan DeMarco said the deer control committee has asked Suburban Whitetail of Pennsylvania to submit a proposal for an archery hunt in the township in September.</p>
<p>Commissioners also introduced an ordinance rezoning 2987 Babcock Blvd., to C-1, regional commercial, to accommodate expansion of The Barn landscape materials company.</p>
<p>The parcel currently has three zoning classifications, one residential and two commercial.</p>
<p>Residents Debbie Nolan and Darlene DiDonato asked whether The Barn applied for a logging permit for the trees already cut down, plans for the site and why the commercial business is currently operating in a residential zone. Members said the questioned would be answered by mail and the ordinance will be voted on at a later meeting.</p>
<p>Commissioners voted to cancel their May 4 meeting. The May 18 meeting will likely be virtual, said commission President Steve Korbel.</p>
<p>“I’m not real sure that large gatherings will be permitted at that point,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Korbel added that the township is “open,” although the building is not. Staff is working from home and will respond to residents’ issues.</p>
<p>“Our top priority is the safety of our employees and our residents,” he said. “The social distancing appears to be working. Please continue to follow the orders from the governor. …The most patriotic thing we can do is stay at home and keep everyone safe at this point.”</p>
