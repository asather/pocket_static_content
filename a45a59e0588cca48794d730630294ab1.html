To be honest, I’m starting to think the worst because of the time that’s gone by without hearing anything [from her]. ... Today I walked on a bridge by myself just seeing what she might have saw.”</p><p>Ms. Turner was last seen around 6 p.m. at Dobra Tea in Squirrel Hill on Monday, according to family.

I feel it. We’re going to find her,” said Latika Ann, 27, a fellow teaching artist at the Braddock library.&nbsp;“ Tonee doesn’t deserve to be lost. Tonee keeps me happy even when I don’t want to smile. ... It’s like a part of the [library] family is missing.”</p><p><em>Ashley Murray: 412-263-1750, amurray@post-gazette.com&nbsp;or on Twitter @Ashley__Murray</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2020/01/04/search-missing-woman-pittsburgh-tonee-turner/stories/202001040058</original_url>
