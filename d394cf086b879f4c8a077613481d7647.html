<h1>Allegheny Health Network announces mobile COVID-19 testing van in Homewood Tuesday and Thursday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny Health Network is taking COVID-19 testing on the road.</p>
<p>The health network will begin sending a mobile testing site to underserved communities beginning with Homewood on Tuesday and Thursday before moving to different areas each week that have yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Nasal swab testing will take place by appointment only for people showing symptoms including fever, coughing and shortness of breath, or those who have come had contact with someone with a confirmed case. A physician’s order is not required, and a&nbsp;spokesperson said that 50 people will be tested each day.</p>
<p>To set up an appointment, the number to call is 412-687-7348.</p>
<p>The testing site will be outside the Alma Illery Medical Center at 7227 Hamilton Avenue in Homewood between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m on Tuesday and Thursday. Individuals will be contacted directly with their test results in about five-seven days, possibly longer depending on how many tests are being conducted in the region.</p>
<p>“Convenient access to health care should not depend on where a person lives, particularly during a public health crisis,” said Dr. Jerome Gloster, chief executive officer of Primary Care Health Services Inc., a countywide system of primary care centers including the Alma Illery Center, in a statement released by AHN on Monday.</p>
<p>The Heinz Endowments as well as the Henry L. Hillman Foundation provided grant funding for this initiative.</p>
<p>AHN also operates permanent COVID-19 testing sites in the North Side and Braddock and continues to offer drive-up testing sites in Wexford, Bethel Park, Monroeville, Erie and Natrona Heights. These sites require a doctor’s note to be tested.</p>
