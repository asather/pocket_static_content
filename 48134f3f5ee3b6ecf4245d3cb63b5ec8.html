<h1>PennDOT begins pedestrian safety project on Pittsburgh's busy East Carson Street</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Construction begins Monday on the second phase of work to improve the safety of East Carson Street on Pittsburgh’s South Side, one of the most dangerous areas in the region for pedestrians.</p>
<p>Last season, the city completed a $3 million project to install lower pedestrian lights in the main business corridor between South 10th and South 25th streets, sidewalk trees between 17th and 25th streets and flowering baskets from 10th to 17th streets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This season, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation begins a two-year, $16.3 million project to upgrade pedestrian safety between the Smithfield Street Bridge and South 33rd Street on the usually busy street. The project will include 11 new traffic signals, bump-outs to reduce the distance to cross the street at intersections&nbsp;from South Seventh to South 26th streets, and wider, better marked crosswalks throughout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Golden Triangle Construction also will&nbsp;install drainage pipes, maintenance holes and inlets before paving the 2.5-mile stretch.</p>
<p>Mark Bucklaw, president of the South Side Chamber of Commerce, said he’s looking forward to the long-awaited project. PennDOT has regularly cited East Carson’s busy nightlife area as the most dangerous place in the city for pedestrians.</p>
<p>“The whole thing is about safety, and we’re pretty happy about that,” he said.&nbsp;“It’s a big project.”</p>
<p>Work begins at 7 a.m. Monday when the center lane of East Carson is closed between South First and South Third streets, maintaining a single lane of traffic in each direction with concrete barriers surrounding the center lane. Traffic trying to enter East Carson in this area only will be able to turn right and there will be no parking.</p>
<p>Later, crews also will work between South Third and South Ninth and maintain one lane of traffic in each direction. At times, two parking spaces in this area may be blocked temporarily.</p>
<p>Work in both of these areas is expected to continue through early September.</p>
<p>The project also will install pedestrian islands at South 19th and South 22nd streets and a raised median from Hot Metal Street to Sarah Street to prevent crossing the street. Additionally, eight “super bus stops” will be installed between South 17th and South 24th streets so that two Port Authority vehicles can pull to the side at the same time and not hold up other traffic.</p>
<p>Mr. Bucklaw said the neighborhood is more optimistic about the work this year. Businesses weren’t thrilled with the lighting and beautification project, which replaced a small strip of sidewalks closest to the curb rather than the whole sidewalk.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say nobody’s saying what a beautiful job they did with the sidewalks last year,” he said.&nbsp;“It’s unfortunate there wasn’t time and money to do a more complete project.”</p>
