<p>Police have charged Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Jarron Jones in connection to an alleged physical altercation between him and his girlfriend in the early hours of Saturday morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones, 26, of Rochester, N.Y., is charged with aggravated assault, strangulation — both felonies —&nbsp;and simple assault.&nbsp;He is a member of the team’s practice squad.</p>
<p>On Oct. 3, officers responded to a residence on Roberts Street for a report of an ongoing domestic violence altercation around 2 a.m., according to a criminal complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When first responders arrived at the scene, they found a woman walking downstairs from the second floor apartment breathing heavily and crying, according to the criminal complaint. The woman told police a man, later identified as Mr. Jones, was upstairs in the apartment and that there had been a physical altercation between them, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones then walked downstairs and was&nbsp;“immediately detained” due to the woman telling police there was a physical altercation, according to the complaint. Mr. Jones told police he has been renting out this residence and that the two are currently dating, according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones told police he went out with the woman Friday night but had returned home by himself, according to the complaint. Shortly after he returned, Mr. Jones told police his girlfriend came home and started&nbsp;“breaking items in the apartment and yelling at Jones,” according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones then told police he picked her up by&nbsp;“grabbing her by the back and legs and placed her outside,” according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The woman told police Mr. Jones had strangled her, hit her in the face, smashed his Xbox console over her face, picked her up and&nbsp;“threw her outside,” according to the complaint. She then told police she blacked out and lost consciousness during the altercation, according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police at the scene detailed that the woman had sustained abrasions to the right side of her face near her temple, bruising with the onset swelling on her right forearm and a small abrasion on her upper left chest region, according to the complaint. She then signed a victim notification form, but denied a lethality assessment, according to the complaint. Medics transported her to UPMC Presbyterian under stable condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A witness who overheard the altercation told police they heard&nbsp;“very loud banging and the sound of bodies upstairs, yelling between parties and noises that sounded like things breaking,” according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones was then transported by police to the Allegheny County Jail for processing and was released the same day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Steelers signed Mr. Jones in April and he was assigned to the practice squad in September before the start of the season. He also played for the New York Guardians in the XFL in 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When reached for comment on the allegations,&nbsp;Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert provided a written statement:</p>
<p>“We are aware of the situation regarding Jarron Jones. We are gathering all of the details of these disturbing allegations, but we will not comment any further at this time.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing for Mr. Jones has been scheduled for 1:15 p.m. Nov. 24 at the Pittsburgh municipal courthouse, according to court documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal representation for Mr. Jones was not immediately listed on court documents.&nbsp;</p>
