<h1>Greensburg Diocese recommencing Masses on June 1, but with changes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Greensburg will allow its parishes to recommence holding Mass beginning June 1, the diocese said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>Bishop Edward C. Malesic said there will need to be differences in how Masses are held as the church adjusts to the&nbsp;“new normal.” That includes requiring parishioners to wear protective masks and maintain six feet of distance. The bishop said the holy water and baptismal fonts will be drained and the portion of the Mass devoted to the sign of peace will no longer include handshakes.</p>
<p>Despite the latest announcement, Bishop Malesic said parishioners will remain dispensed from their obligation to attend Mass as communities continue to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“I ask that you make your own prudent and informed decision on whether to attend&nbsp;Sunday Mass or not, after taking your own situation into account,” he said. “You should especially use this&nbsp;dispensation from the obligation to attend Mass at this time if you are elderly or have a medical&nbsp;condition that puts you at greater risk for serious complications from this disease.</p>
<p>Here are some of the new protocols:</p>
<p>• People will be seated at least in every other pew using social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>• All communicants will be encouraged to receive Communion in the hand.</p>
<p>• Wine will no longer be offered during the sacrament.</p>
<p>• The sign of peace will be done through a&nbsp;reverential bow.</p>
<p>• Musicians are being asked to limit music, and choirs are not permitted.</p>
<p>• At the discretion of the pastor, Masses are permitted in social halls, other large spaces and&nbsp;outdoors including parking lots.</p>
<p>• Confirmations and First Communions can recommence in July and should be divided into&nbsp;smaller groups if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those who cannot go to church in person, virtual Masses will be livestreamed and news can be found at&nbsp;TheAccentOnline.org or the diocese website.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Diocese of Pittsburgh said it intends to begin daily Masses on June 1 and plans to resume weekend Masses on&nbsp;June 6 and 7.</p>
<p>Public Masses have been canceled since mid-March.</p>
