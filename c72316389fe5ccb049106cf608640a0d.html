<p>BEIJING — China’s ceremonial legislature on Thursday endorsed a national security law for Hong Kong that has strained relations with the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>The National People’s Congress approved the bill as it wrapped up an annual session that was held under intensive anti-coronavirus controls.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong security law will alter the territory’s mini-constitution, or Basic Law, to require its government to enforce measures to be decided later by Chinese leaders.</p>
<p>The measure and the way it is being enacted prompted Washington to announce it no longer will treat Hong Kong as being autonomous from Beijing.</p>
<p>Activists in Hong Kong have complained the law will undermine civil liberties and might be used to suppress political activity.</p>
<p>The legislature also approved a government budget that will increase spending to generate jobs in an effort to reverse an economic slump after Chinese industries were shut down to fight the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
