<h1>Independent Catholic school planned for South Hills</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A new independent Catholic elementary school is planning to begin enrollment in January 2021.</p>
<p>The new school, named the South Hills Catholic Academy, will serve preschool through eighth-grade students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>John Hans, the chairman of the South Hills Catholic Academy Foundation, said Tuesday the academy will be governed by an independent board of clergy and lay people, which will "guide and advise" the head of school and staff. While the school is independent of the diocesan school system, the&nbsp;Diocese of Pittsburgh will have a seat on the board.</p>
<p>A location for the academy has not been decided, though Mr. Hans said there are several sites that are being examined.</p>
<p>South Hills will offer a traditional curriculum to focus heavily on the liberal arts. It will work with the Institute for Liberal Catholic Education, a national organization that aids schools in offering a traditional Catholic curriculum. Mr. Hans said the institute will act as a “consulting partner.”</p>
<p>"Part of the mission [of the diocese] is to ensure the vibrancy and continuation of Catholic liberal education," Mr. Hans said. "There was a call in the laity to become more active to make the Catholic Church come alive."</p>
<p>According to a press release, the academy will focus heavily on students of "modest means" and children of immigrants. Mr. Hans said scholarships can be made available for students in order to subsidize tuition costs.</p>
<p>"We're just trying to make sure Catholic education is available to all people of various socio- and economic demographics," Mr. Hans said.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Although the diocese has been closing and consolidating elementary schools, Mr. Hans said Aquinas Academy, an independent Catholic school in Hampton, will serve as a "guide" for the operation of South Hills Catholic Academy.</span></p>
<p>Leslie Mistros, head of school at Aquinas, said Tuesday the school typically receives around 85%-95% of its funding through tuition dollars and financial aid.</p>
<p>Aquinas Academy is supported by state educational tax credit programs and receives money through fundraisers and donations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mistros said the primary challenge of functioning independently is that there isn't a resource to "fall back on" and the school must rely on community members to "make up the difference" financially.</p>
<p>Approval for the South Hills academy recently was given by Bishop David Zubik, so Mr. Hans said the school has begun the process of receiving funds for the school.</p>
<p>"[We are] working with benefactors to come up with the necessary funding to procure the sites and the funds [to create] scholarships," Mr. Hans said.</p>
