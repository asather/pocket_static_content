<h1>WPIAL Class 2A-1A roundup: Freedom wins days after coach's resignation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It took a while for Freedom to get going against Riverside after the program went through a tumultuous week that saw head coach Greg Toney resign and athletic director John Rosa take over on an interim basis.</p>
<p>But get going they did.</p>
<p>Senior quarterback Cole Beck completed 18 of 28 for 235 yards and three touchdowns to Reiker Welling, including a 98-yarder, to lead the Bulldogs (1-1, 1-1) to a 21-0 road win against Riverside in a Midwestern Conference matchup.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s kind of crazy and unfortunate,” Rosa said. “But we’re proud of the kids and the way they responded.”</p>
<p>Being on the field brought to a close a bizarre series of events that, according to reports, Toney was voted out in a 15-12 decision Monday in a players’ only meeting. Toney then tendered his resignation and left the program along with five assistant coaches. The Freedom Area School District later disputed the report saying, in part, it “provided an inaccurate and incomplete representation of the details.”</p>
<p>Rosa, who also took over on an interim basis in 2018 after then-coach Russ Barley resigned, now is 9-1 as an interim coach for the Bulldogs. But that did not make the experience any easier.</p>
<p>“It was a little stressful and we didn’t have a lot of time to prepare, but we threw some things together,” Rosa said.</p>
<p><strong>More Class 2A</strong></p>
<p><strong>Washington 55, Waynesburg 0</strong>: The No. 3-ranked Prexies (1-1, 1-1) rebounded well from their one-point, season-opening loss to McGuffey as Mike Allen ran for one touchdown and caught one of Devon Fuse’s two scoring throws as they opened a 42-0 halftime lead on Waynesburg (0-2, 0-2), which now has lost 18 consecutive conference games, dating to 2017 when it was in the Interstate.</p>
<p><strong>McGuffey 40, Charleroi 6</strong>: Kyle Brookman and McKinley Whipkey each scored two touchdowns as the No. 2 Highlanders (2-0, 2-0) rolled over the Bulldogs (0-2, 0-2) in a Century Conference game.</p>
<p><strong>Apollo-Ridge 48, Freeport 14</strong>: The Yellowjackets (1-1) may have opened the scoring against their old Allegheny Conference rivals when Vnnie Clark hit Brady Stivenson with a 56-yard touchdown pass, but the No. 5 Vikings (2-0) took over as they rolled up 482 yards of offense, led by 153 rushing yards and three touchdowns from Logan Harmon in the running-clock victory.</p>
<p><strong>Beaver Falls 29, Laurel 14</strong>: The Spartans (1-1, 1-1) actually had a 7-6 lead in the third quarter on a Michael Pasquarello 17-yard touchdown reception, but the No. 1 Tigers (2-0, 2-0) and Josh Hough scored the back-breaker on a 57-yard third-quarter jaunt and Livingston Shileak capped it with his second score of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Class 1A games</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clairton 59, Leechburg 14</strong>: The Blue Devils (1-1, 1-1) were brought back to Earth after their Week 1 upset against Greensburg Central Catholic as Dontae Sanders came up with a huge game with six carries for 212 yards and three touchdowns to lead the No. 1 Bears (2-0, 2-0) to a running-clock victory.</p>
<p><strong>Cornell 27, Northgate 6</strong>: The Raiders (1-1, 1-1) shook off a grueling loss to Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in the season opener as Tim Henderson carried five times for 93 yards and two touchdowns to even its record in the Big Seven Conference and run the Flames’ current skid to 26 games.</p>
<p><strong>Carmichaels 43, Mapletown 8</strong>: With West Greene forced to postpone its game against California, the Mikes (2-0, 2-0) were able to take first place in the Tri-County South Conference as Trenton Carter threw for three scores to Michael Stewart and ran for another in a big win against the Maples (0-2, 0-2).</p>
<p><strong>Our Lady of the Sacred Heart 41, Burgettstown 0</strong>: Jay Pearson started things off for the Chargers (2-0, 2-0) with an 85-yard kickoff return, then the offense got rolling as Neimiah Azeem hit Jay Pearson with two touchdown passes in a big win against the Blue Devils (1-1, 1-1).</p>
