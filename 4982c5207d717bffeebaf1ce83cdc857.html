<h1>Pirates to use PNG Field in Altoona as alternate training facility</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Pirates announced on Thursday that they will use Peoples Natural Gas Field in Altoona as an alternate facility for spring training 2.0.</span></p>
<p>PNG Field is the home of the Class AA Altoona Curve, which has been a Pirates affiliate since 1999.</p>
<p>Altoona will be used by minor league and rehabbing players who do not train at PNC Park, where the Pirates will hold the bulk of their workouts.</p>
<p>â€œThe Pirates organization is appreciative of the long-standing relationship we have had for over two decades with the Altoona Curve," Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said in a statement. "The people, proximity, along with the first-class facility, makes Peoples Natural Gas Field an ideal choice to safely host our alternate training site for the upcoming season."</p>
<p>In the release, the Pirates announced that workout dates, a roster and media information will be announced in the coming days.</p>
<p>"The Curve and Pirates have shared a remarkable relationship since 1999," Curve GM Derek Martin said in a statement. "Being chosen as the alternate training facility really reinforces the strength of that relationship. Being 90 miles from PNC Park, Altoona is a great location to allow the Pirates to get a player to Pittsburgh, or wherever they need to get to, quickly and safely."</p>
