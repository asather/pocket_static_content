<h1>Steelers offer some relief for season ticket holders 'uniquely affected' by pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers season ticket holders “uniquely affected” by the COVID-19 pandemic can apply to opt out of games this season and receive a credit for next season.</p>
<p>“We are continuing to work directly with those season ticket holders on an individual basis who felt they are uniquely affected by the current situation,” Steelers spokesman Burt Lauten said. “We established a process to review circumstances to ensure those who have concerns will be handled directly so their season tickets are protected for the 2021 season. We are not canceling those season ticket holders accounts who have been approved through our process. Their tickets are on hold for the 2020 season without penalty due to the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p>
<p>The NFL has said it would like to play games with fans in the stands this season, but the possibility exists that games could be played without fans.&nbsp;The Steelers previously announced they would refund season ticket holders if games are canceled.</p>
