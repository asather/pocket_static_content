<h1>Woman arrested after police say she tried to set fires at Fineview public housing complex</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A North Side woman was arrested on Saturday after she allegedly tried to set a unit at the Allegheny Dwellings public housing complex on fire in late March.</p>
<p>Candice Copeland, 31, was charged on March 25 with&nbsp;four counts of attempted homicide, five counts of aggravated assault, six counts of aggravated arson, four counts of arson endangering property, intimidation of witnesses, and other minor counts.</p>
<p>A criminal complaint said the unit on the 1700 block of Belleau Drive in Pittsburgh’s Fineview neighborhood was occupied by two witnesses. Ms. Copeland is involved in another case with both of them.</p>
<p>Witness reports in the criminal complaint said&nbsp;Ms. Copeland stood outside the apartment around 7 a.m. and called for them to come outside. She then urinated against the front door of the apartment when the occupants refused to leave, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Ms. Copeland left, but she came back repeatedly and tried to set the door on fire with charcoal lighter fluid, police said. The people in the apartment put the fires out using pots of water.</p>
<p>Police said witness reports and security footage confirmed Ms. Copeland was seen&nbsp;coming and going from the apartment.</p>
<p>Authorities estimated she caused about $500 in damages to the property, which is owned by the Pittsburgh Housing Authority.</p>
<p>Ms. Copeland’s preliminary arraignment was Saturday at 12:40 a.m. Her preliminary hearing is set for June 25.</p>
