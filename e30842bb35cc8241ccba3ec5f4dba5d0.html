<h1>Plum drug dealer who used Heinz Lofts for heroin operation gets 10 years behind bars</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Plum man whose drug trafficking operation was based at the Heinz Lofts apartments on the North Shore is headed to federal prison for a decade.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Nora Barry Fischer imposed that term Thursday on Brandon Winters, 43.</p>
<p>Winters had pleaded guilty in September to possession with intent to deliver heroin, fentanyl and cocaine.</p>
<p>The FBI and state police said they had received information about drug dealing by Winters and two associates, Eduard Rijo and Erick Martinez, in January 2019 and set up surveillance on Apartment 205 in the Heinz Lofts complex.</p>
<p>Law officers believed that Winters was expecting a re-supply in late January and after watching the suspects executed a federal search warrant on Jan. 30, 2019.</p>
<p>Inside, authorities found Winters, Martinez and Rijo in the living room with more than $250,000 in cash scattered around. The men had been counting the money when the agents burst in.</p>
<p>On the kitchen floor, investigators found a roller duffel bag that Mr. Rijo had been seen pulling into the apartment earlier, prosecutors said, containing 1,500 bricks of heroin mixed with fentanyl.</p>
<p>The officers also recovered a half kilo of cocaine hidden in the headboard of the master bedroom.</p>
<p>A search of Mr. Martinez's car revealed a hidden trap compartment for drugs, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Winters' lawyer, Stephen Capone, said his client has learned his lesson from the arrest and is done with drug trafficking. He said Winters is committed to his young family and is willing to receive treatment for his own substance abuse so he can return to society in 10 years.</p>
<p>In imposing the sentence, U.S. District Judge Nora Barry Fischer said Winters was motivated by selfishness and greed for the money in the drug trade.</p>
<p>The case against his accused co-conspirators is pending.</p>
