<h1>Fishing Report: Blue catfish making a comeback; tough angling in low water</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh catfish anglers are abuzz about a 20-pound blue catfish caught and released by Neng Pawanram of Beaver County in the Ohio River’s Montgomery Pool on Sept. 9.</p>
<p>The largest catfish species in North America, blues are native to the Ohio River and typically exceed 40 inches in northern waters. Regionally extinct in Pennsylvania for 100 years, blues have been making their way up the Ohio following a reintroduction program in West Virginia, where the state record is nearly&nbsp;44 inches, 44½ pounds, caught in the Ohio River.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2019, a blue catfish was caught in Pennsylvania by Kevin Charles Snyder of Beaver County. This year, 10 blues are believed to have been caught in the Pennsylvania stretch of the Ohio River. Four were caught by Mr. Pawanram.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Erie</strong> (Erie County) Walleye up to 27 inches were caught at 65-75 feet out of Walnut Creek Access Area, but most were small or throwbacks. The fish were caught on chartreuse spoons and worm harnesses. Many could be seen on electronics but there were few hitters. Steelhead were caught and released while trolling for walleye off Elk Creek.</p>
<p><strong>Pymatuning Reservoir</strong> (Crawford County) Several largemouth bass were caught and released after going for soft plastics fished off weeds.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Wilhelm</strong> (Mercer County) Largemouths and crappies were caught.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Creek</strong> (Indiana County) Low water impeded fishing but opened a lot of shoreline.</p>
<p><strong>Keystone Power Dam</strong> (Armstrong County) With drought-level waters, shore anglers had access to rarely accessible shorelines. Ramps were above water, spoiling the day for boat launchers. Some kayakers claimed success flipping soft plastics over visible wood.</p>
<p><strong>North Park Lake</strong> (Allegheny County) Lily pads clogged the water for some paddlers, but anglers found largemouths and bluegills underneath. The bass took weedless plugs and the ’gills went for tipped jigs.</p>
<p><strong>Keystone Lake</strong> (Westmoreland County) Two small bluegills were caught on bait under a bobber by Leia Felmley, 13, of Delmont.</p>
<p><strong>Youghiogheny River</strong> (Fayette County) Muskellunge were seen but not hooked in waters downstream from Connellsville.</p>
