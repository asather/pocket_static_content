<h1>Don’t expect a mailer about that Citizen Police Review Board ballot question</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh voters should not expect to receive anything in the mail spelling out the full language of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/07/15/Pittsburgh-voters-referendum-ballot-question-elections-citizen-Police-Review-Board-expanded-powers/stories/202007150118" target="_blank">Citizen Police Review Board ballot referendum</a> ahead of Nov. 3, with council members and the city clerk’s office citing high costs.</p>
<p>The question asks voters if they support&nbsp;“expanding the powers of the Independent Citizen Police Review Board to allow the&nbsp;Board to require police officers to participate in investigations, conducting&nbsp;performance audits of the Police Bureau and preventing the removal of Board&nbsp;members except for just cause and with City Council approval.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost to mail 137,000 voters in the city would be $66,000, according to City Clerk Brenda Pree. Ms. Pree said&nbsp;the expanded language would not fit on&nbsp;a postcard and that a letter-size mailing would be required to print the entire Home Rule Charter amendment.</p>
<p>“Given the pandemic and our fragile financial state as a city, we just think it’s an unnecessary expense at this time,” said Councilman Ricky Burgess.&nbsp;“This was a provision we put in really not thinking that the pandemic would be this exhaustive. It’s also not something we normally do.”</p>
<p>But some council members expressed concern.</p>
<p>“I still feel like there’s a lack of awareness that there is both a ballot text and full text and what the meaning of it is,” said Councilwoman Deb Gross.&nbsp;“… I would like us to put some energy into doing better outreach.”</p>
<p>Ms. Pree said the referendum language will be available on the city’s website and that requests for the full language will be honored.</p>
<p>“I generally don’t feel comfortable taking away a method of educating voters and the public without having a plan of action in its place,” said Councilwoman Erika Strassburger. “I think posting on the website is a good start. … But what are all the options?”</p>
<p>Council gave an affirmative recommendation to removing mailing requirement in a 6-2 vote. Ms. Gross and Ms. Strassburger abstained.</p>
<p>Council will take a final vote Tuesday.</p>
