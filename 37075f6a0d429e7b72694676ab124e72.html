<h1>Paul Zeise: If Pitt is for real, the goal should be at least 8 wins </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pat Narduzzi was offended last week that Pitt didn’t receive a single vote in the AP preseason Top 25 poll. He was not shy about making it known to the one voter who covers the team that he was not happy with him.</p>
<p>It was one of those exchanges where a coach tried to come off like he was joking and in some ways is being half-hearted, but it was clear he was irritated. Coaches all claim they don’t care about rankings but almost always preach about how their team isn’t ranked properly.</p>
<p>The beauty of college football is that at some point the talk is cheap and you get to play the games. Nobody on Saturday afternoons is concerned with rankings, as they are all just trying to win a game. And the more games you win, the more you increase your chances of getting ranked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narduzzi’s Panthers are likely going to be one of the top 25 teams playing college football this year. The Panthers have an experienced quarterback, offensive line and defense. They have staff continuity and they have a lot of really good leadership in their locker room.</p>
<p>There is a good case to be made that Pitt should have been ranked in the preseason poll. But Pitt has been a mostly middling program for at least a decade and thus hasn’t earned the benefit of the doubt to be ranked in the preseason poll, even when it seems they should.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the Panthers’ schedule, there isn’t a ton of heavy lifting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look at the first five games of the season and say if Pitt is legitimately a Top 25 team, then the Panthers need to get off to a 5-0 start before a two-game stretch on the road against Miami and home against Notre Dame. Those are the first two games I see that if they lose, they shouldn’t be subject to criticism.</p>
<p>Is that fair? When you claim you are a Top 25 team and those who don’t vote for you are “clowns,” well, that’s the standard you’ve set for yourself. It’s writing a check that you hope your hind parts can cash.</p>
<p>Think about it — a legitimate Top 25 team should not lose to Austin Peay in the opener. Syracuse is the second opponent and the Orange have been in disarray this summer and aren’t very good. The toughest test in the first five weeks will be Louisville, but a legitimate team wins that game at home.</p>
<p>The next week the Panthers play an NC State team that can’t figure out if they want to play this year or not. And as much as I love former Pitt assistant Jeff Hafley and think he will do a great job at Boston College, I can’t imagine any first year coach has had an easy time trying to install a system in the era of COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>That’s five winnable games. Miami on the road and Notre Dame at home will be two tough games, but this would appear to be the year the Panthers should at least split those two games to get to 6-1.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, a trip to Florida State is a daunting task, but the Seminoles have a first-year coach and a whole lot of rebuilding to do. A legitimate team should go to Florida State and win, and the next week beat a rebuilding Georgia Tech team.</p>
<p>Virginia Tech is almost always a toss-up game with Pitt, but the game is at Heinz Field so the Panthers need to win it. There’d be no shame in losing to Clemson, so from where I sit, the Panthers — if they are a legitimate Top 25 team — should be 9-2 or, at the very worst, 8-3.</p>
<p>Anything short of eight wins with zero bad losses is not acceptable this year for the Panthers. That may be a high standard to set, especially with only 11 games, but it is what the top teams do and Narduzzi said the Panthers should be ranked.</p>
<p>I do believe this Pitt team is capable of doing some special things, and I do think they will eventually prove it on the field. But they can’t have even one of those really bad losses that seem to haunt them every year.</p>
