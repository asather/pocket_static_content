<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An undisclosed number of Pittsburgh police officers from Zone 2 are self isolating after exposure to someone with symptoms similar to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Police were potentially exposed to the virus while responding Monday afternoon to a minor car crash involving two vehicles in Market Square Downtown, city police spokesman Chris Togneri said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the drivers involved in the collision showed symptoms resembling COVID-19, police said.</p>
<p>The driver was taken to a local hospital for testing.</p>
<p>“Out of an abundance of caution, officers who were at the crash scene were sent home to self-isolate until the matter is further evaluated,” Mr. Togneri said in a police report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the officers are showing symptoms, police said.</p>
