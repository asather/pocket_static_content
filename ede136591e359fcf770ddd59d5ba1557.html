<h1>Strange times call for inventive journalism</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Reporting on a crisis while actually being in one was never part of the syllabus.</p>
<p>But the advanced video reporting and producing course at West Virginia University made do after classes were switched online in March.</p>
<p>“We flipped it,” said Gina Dahlia, who teaches the course and is the faculty adviser for the award-winning weekly newscast.</p>
<p>“I said to them ‘This is life, this is what you face as reporters. What better way to talk to [professional] news directors about how we didn’t drop the ball in learning how to report in a crisis?’”</p>
<p>Instead of pitching stories, writing scripts, shooting and editing newscasts in the Reed College of Media, the year’s final broadcast will be a melange of feel-good stories created and reported by the students from wherever they’re sheltering.</p>
<p>“Far Apart, Together” will go online April 29 — “in a perfect world,” Ms. Dahlia said, laughing.</p>
<p>“I had to teach a whole new genre of editing,” she said, noting that students spent two weeks learning how to shoot and edit on their iPhones.&nbsp;There might be one “normal element in “Far Apart, Together”: the three anchors all live within a reasonable driving distance from the studio and agreed to come in separately to do their lead-ins and tagouts.</p>
<p>The students were keen to do something different. One sports reporter did a short cooking segment. Others went out into the field to do safe distancing interviews, or recorded interviews via Zoom, Skype or FaceTime. Unlike the usual 15-minute newscasts, the virtual newscast will likely be longer.</p>
<p>“This is proving to be much bigger, and maybe better,” Ms. Dahlia said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said that three seniors already have jobs lined up in television, beginning in May.</p>
<p>“They’ve said ‘The idea that we may still be essential employees in lockdown from home, the idea that we are learning how to gather footage, record it and report it with an iPhone, makes us feel more comfortable joining the work force.”</p>
