<h1>The illusion is real: Pittsburgh Cultural Trust will stream live Liberty Magic shows beginning Friday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Perhaps there’s no magic in the air this spring, but it will be online.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust announced it will host Friday evening live-streaming events featuring Liberty Magic talent through its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CulturalTrust" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> as well as its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CulturalTrust/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>. The shows are free, beginning at 7:30 p.m. April 24.</p>
<p>Eric Jones, who in early 2019 kicked off the Liberty Magic venue series with his&nbsp;“Impossible” night of sleight-of-hand, will perform. Anna DeGuzman, who was here a few months back, will bring her&nbsp;“cardistry” to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both are internationally known talents with significant followings on social media. Those who tune in live can ask them questions via chat.</p>
<p>And proving that magic can be bottled, these Liberty Magic shows will be archived to watch online later.</p>
