<h1>Learning hub in Hill District will house students doing virtual school </h1>

<p>Fresh paper lanterns, new colored ceiling lights, posters and original student art work hang in the classrooms at ACH Clear Pathways in the Hill District where 24 children will gather this week to start the school year in a virtual learning hub.</p>
<p>For 10 years, ACH has provided disadvantaged youth with after-school and summertime arts programming including dance, acting, music, painting, drawing and poetry writing.</p>
<p>But when the COVID-19 pandemic upended traditional education models, Tyian Battle, executive director of the nonprofit, decided to add an all-day ELearning Hub to ACH’s offerings.</p>
<p>The hub is designed for young students of parents who have challenges overseeing remote education at home.</p>
<p>“God talks to me at night and he said, ‘You have a place for kids whose parents need to go to work,’ ” said Ms. Battle.</p>
<p>Students in grades kindergarten through 9 will arrive at the hub at 8:30 a.m. and after the school day concludes, they will participate in ACH’s arts programs, which are available until 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Four certified teachers last week were preparing the space where they will oversee lessons and assist six students per classroom grouped by grade levels.</p>
<p>The teachers at ACH already have been in touch with faculty and staff at Pittsburgh Public Schools and other schools to coordinate the curriculum that students will access on laptops.</p>
<p>Besides PPS, students at the ACH hub are enrolled at the Neighborhood Academy, Urban Academy of Greater Pittsburgh Charter, Environmental Charter School, and St. Benedict the Moor, all in the city; and Harrison Middle in the Baldwin-Whitehall School District.</p>
<p>All have participated in ACH out-of-school programs and creative camps.</p>
<p>“This is not just a drop-in service,” said Ms. Battle. “I’m big on quality and would rather have a small amount of kids so they get the full effect.”</p>
<p>Desks have been placed six feet apart to provide social distance; students, staff and visitors will have temperature checks each morning, wear masks and adhere to six-foot spacing decals on the floors when traveling the hallways.</p>
<p>Traditional classrooms were already in place when ACH in June 2019 began leasing the lower level of the Kaufmann Center located at Centre Avenue and Heldman Street.</p>
<p>For years the space was occupied by Hill House Passport Academy Charter School, which moved Downtown last year.</p>
<p>When Hill House Association, a historic social services agency opted to sell its real estate assets to pay off debts, it approached ACH about buying the entire building.&nbsp;ACH closed on the 22,000-square-foot property in December and is now renovating and adding space.</p>
<p>Constructed in the early 20th century to house the Irene Kaufmann Settlement —&nbsp;a center of medical care, education, social services and arts programs for the Jewish community and others —&nbsp;the building features the Elsie H. Hillman Auditorium which has capacity for 400.</p>
<p>The Hillman Family Foundations, a longtime supporter of ACH programs, supplied $1.6 million for ACH to acquire the building.</p>
<p>“The Kaufmann Center has been a center of culture in the Hill District for decades and certainly with the Elsie H. Hillman Auditorium as part of that legacy we always had aspirations to make sure that legacy was able to continue,” said D. Tyler Gourley, vice president of Hillman.</p>
<p>“We already had a relationship with ACH which does wonderful work,” he said. “Tyian is a great leader in the community … and the development of the learning hub is just another example of that.”</p>
<p>Ms. Battle, 42, founded ACH to honor her son, Amon C. Harris who died at age 7 from an undiagnosed heart condition.</p>
<p>Amon would’ve graduated from high school in 2019 so buying the Kaufmann Center “was like a graduation gift for me,” she said.</p>
<p>ACH leased three different locations in the Hill District before moving to its current home.&nbsp;“We had to do our art and then break it down and tuck it away because we were in community spaces,” said Ms. Battle. “Now we can do it and meet our potential.”</p>

<p>The renovations and addition, designed by R3A Architecture and constructed by Massaro Corporation, include an art gallery, cafeteria, digital media center, recording studio and a writing center that will be a collaboration of ACH and Duquesne University’s English department and be open to the community as well as ACH students.</p>
<p><strong>Several backers</strong></p>
<p>When renovations are complete, Ms. Battle expects to have several paying tenants who will generate revenues for ACH.</p>
<p>Funders for the renovations —&nbsp;which will cost close to $2 million —&nbsp;include Hillman, the Heinz Endowments, McAuley Ministries, the Pittsburgh Foundation, the state’s Neighborhood Assistance Program and Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program, UPMC, TriState Capital and the city’s Urban Redevelopment Authority.</p>
<p>Grants from McAuley and Hillman and a partnership of Allegheny County, United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania and Trying Together —&nbsp;a nonprofit that provides childcare and education supports —&nbsp;are covering the $99,000 needed to run the learning hub for nine weeks, said Ms. Battle.</p>
<p>ACH is continuing fundraising for future sustainability, she said.</p>
<p>Landing in the spot where Hill House offered arts and community programs is a coming home of sorts for Ms. Battle.&nbsp;She was raised in the neighborhood and took piano lessons at the Hill House.</p>
<p>“It’s very important for me to continue the Hill House legacy,” she said.</p>
<p>“I want to really, really utilize the space and I’ve promised the community I will do that. After losing [Amon], I thought the sun would never shine. I wanted to do the best for my son and I feel I’ve accomplished that. Now this job is missionary work.”</p>
<p>Her other son, 8-year-old Ezra Harris, will be a student at the learning hub beginning this week.</p>
<p>“And I’ll be here working,” said Ms. Battle.</p>
