<h1>Junior Achievement chief executive Dennis Gilfoyle to retire</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dennis Gilfoyle, president and chief executive of Junior Achievement of Western Pennsylvania for 14 years, plans to retire later this year after spending more than three decades with the organization.</p>
<p>He will remain in the job until a successor is in place, Junior Achievement said.</p>
<p>The nonprofit provides education and hands-on training in job skills, financial literacy and entrepreneurship to students from kindergarten through high school.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilfoyle joined Junior Achievement in 1984 in its Pittsburgh office to manage an in-school business training program. He later held jobs in marketing, fundraising and operations.</p>
<p>In 1995, he was named president of Junior Achievement in Jacksonville, Fla.</p>
<p>He returned to Pittsburgh in 1997 as vice president and became president in 2006.</p>
<p>He oversaw development of JA Biz Town, a complex in South Fayette where students in grades 4-6 get hands-on career and personal finance training in simulated storefronts sponsored by local businesses.</p>
<p>The complex opened in January adjacent to Junior Achievement’s headquarters.</p>
<p>“The feeling you get from knowing you’ve helped a young person become successful in whatever career they have chosen is amazing,” Mr. Gilfoyle said in a statement.</p>
<p>Founded in 1939, the local Junior Achievement has approximately 70,000 students enrolled in programs in 50 counties in western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia.</p>
