<h1>Review: Pittsburgh Symphony showcases marvelous pianist in Grieg concerto</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Credit where it’s due, Friday’s Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concert was exceptional. The combination of guest conductor Mark Elder and pianist <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2017/10/07/Koenig-Pittsburgh-Symphony-Orchestra-review-Chopin-Rachmaninoff-concerto-Avdeeva/stories/201710060163" target="_blank">Yulianna Avdeeva</a> proved a phenomenal match in Grieg’s Concerto in A minor, and the orchestra delivered Sibelius’ Symphony No. 1 in E minor with a feel for the epic.</p>
<p>The concert opener, Berlioz’s&nbsp;“King Lear Overture,” hops around among emotional characters, and the orchestra obliged with glorious, lyrical lines and sprightly energy throughout. Sibelius first symphony embodies that sense of Finnish nationalism that so endeared him to his country and the world.&nbsp;The first movement opened with a plaintive, portentous clarinet solo played Friday by principal clarinet Michael Rusinek before Mr. Elder, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2018/03/24/Concert-review-Pittsburgh-Symphony-Orchestra-Anne-Martindale-Williams-Elgar-Mark-Elder/stories/201803230172" target="_blank">who last appeared with the orchestra in 2018</a>, brought in pulsing, shimmering strings — striking that perfect, cold clarity that complements Sibelius’ impassioned melodic writing. In the second movement, strings created a muted, breathless sound that was wonderfully intimate and distinctive. I look forward to hearing him in future seasons. The&nbsp;final movement has a quasi-religious, diabolical feel at times given the composer’s judicious use of trombone chorales, expertly performed on Friday.</p>
<p>Ms. Avdeeva’s interpretation of the Grieg was marvelous, evidencing a nuanced sense of pacing and drama throughout. Here was a master at work. She created a sense of polished spontaneity, an incredibly difficult feat with such a well-known, difficult concerto. Mr. Elder kept the orchestra right alongside her with simple, prudent gestures, matching her dynamic vitality but never overshadowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This concert repeats Sunday at 2:30 p.m. <a href="https://pittsburghsymphony.org/production/62386/performance/62386/seat_selection" target="_blank">Tickets are $20-$97</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Around town</strong></p>
<p>On Sunday March 1 at Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland, the Pittsburgh Concert Chorale performed Carl Orff’s “Carmina Burana,” perhaps one of the best-known and most often emulated (OK, ripped off) choral works in the repertoire. The music is simple, even primal — the choir, directed by Susan Medley, obliged with a vehement, raw sound that suited the music wonderfully. While the original composition calls for a large orchestra, this is tough to conjure for choirs with smaller budgets. The composer himself approved a reduced version of the music for two pianos and percussion. This version may not have have the variety of tone color of the orchestral original, but the percussion section certainly preserves the vigor of the music.</p>
<p>Ms. Medley kept instruments and voices tightly in sync with an excellent ear for balance. An amateur ensemble, the Concert Chorale’s diction and energy were strong — it’s typical for large vocal ensembles to drag and slow down, but the choir charged ahead with vigor. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2020/02/03/Pittsburgh-Concert-Chorale-chorus-singing-health-Pittsburgh-Mendelssohn-Choir/stories/202001290111" target="_blank">I recently wrote about how more and more Americans are singing in choirs</a>, and the Concert Chorale provides a strong example for why it’s such a popular activity. The ensemble came together to create something beautiful. Their skill and passion was fulfilling to listen to, even more-so to experience from the stage, I’d imagine. Bravo.</p>
