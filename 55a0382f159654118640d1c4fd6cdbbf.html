<h1>Advocates study: Cost too high, riders served too low to justify shuttle through Schenley Park</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A new report from transportation advocates argues that the price is too high and number of riders served would be too low to justify Pittsburgh’s plan to build a road, with the possibility of a shuttle service, through Schenley Park, connecting Hazelwood and Oakland.</p>
<p>“A People’s Audit of the Mon-Oakland Connector,” released Friday by Pittsburghers for Public Transit and the CMU student-led Tech4Society, concluded that an extension of Port Authority bus routes from Hazelwood to other neighborhoods would better serve residents, bringing them to nearby grocery stores, business districts and hospitals.</p>
<p>The study argues for an extension of the 75 bus route across the Hot Metal Bridge, connecting Hazelwood to the South Side Flats, and for creating weekend service on the 93 route, a route that runs on weekdays from Hazelwood through Oakland to Lawrenceville.</p>
<p>Public transportation does not fall under the city’s purview.</p>
<p>According to the authors’ calculations, the city’s plan to build a connection between Hazelwood and Oakland through the Four Mile Run neighborhood and Schenley Park would cost $23 million in taxpayer dollars and only decrease travel times by 13 minutes compared to public transit.</p>
<p>“For every important destination that residents in these communities need to access, whether it's food, jobs or healthcare, public transit vastly out performs the best case scenario for the Mon-Oakland Connector,” said Laura Wiens, executive director of Pittsburghers for Public Transit.</p>
<p>“I know it's hard for folks to understand why we're talking about this in the time of COVID, but it would be especially important in a time like this,” she added.</p>
<p>The city describes the project as one that “creates trail connections for pedestrians, cyclists, and a micro-transit service between neighborhoods along the Monongahela River and Oakland,” according to its 2020 capital budget that outlines $18.6 million in funding from 2019 to 2025, with $8 million from prior years unexpended.</p>
<p>"This is an initiative to connect Hazelwood to the the third-largest economic center in Pennsylvania, using electric vehicles to take increased vehicular traffic off Second Avenue and Bates Street,” said Timothy McNulty, mayoral spokesman. “The existing connection to Oakland using Bates is not sufficient and cannot handle increased traffic, so the city and its partners are working on an environmentally beneficial plan to connect workers to jobs."</p>
<p>The proposed neighborhood shuttle is part of a $41 million project that will use mostly green solutions to correct serious stormwater runoff problems in the lower Greenfield area known as "The Run." The city agreed to address neighborhood flooding concerns as part of the transportation project after complaints from residents.</p>
<p>In addition to the city's plan and the proposal from advocates, the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission in February <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/02/09/Hazelwood-Second-Avenue-Southwestern-Pennsylvania-Commission-PennDOT-Port-Authority/stories/202002060162" target="_blank">released a study of the Second Avenue corridor through Hazelwood</a> that calls for improvements ranging from $289.6 million to $351.3 million over 12 years that include improved bus service, more park-and-ride lots and even a new bridge between Hazelwood and the South Side.</p>
<p>Port Authority said it would consider the SPC proposals as part of its recently started 25-year plan. The agency declined comment on the proposal from advocates.</p>
<p>The proposed plan for the roadway from the neighborhoods along the Monongahela River to universities and medical centers in Oakland has proved controversial among some residents and public transit advocates that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/07/22/Pittsburgh-Pennsylvania-community-development-Mon-Oakland-Connector-protest/stories/201907220036" target="_blank">accuse the city and others</a>&nbsp;of focusing only on connecting workers to the 178-acre riverfront former industrial site being r<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2020/02/25/Innovation-Lab-Hazeiwood-Green-GSVlabs-Almono-roundhouse/stories/202002250128" target="_blank">edeveloped today under the name&nbsp;Hazelwood Green</a>.</p>
<p>A bill in city council, proposed by Councilman Corey O’Connor, who represents the area, aims to codify a public process for the proposal of new vehicular traffic in a city park, including mandating a 30-day pubic comment period.</p>
