<h1>As pandemic costs mount for college students and campuses, eyes are on Congress</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On college campuses in Pittsburgh and beyond, the meter is running. Only the expenses this fall go far beyond routine instruction, three squares daily and upscale places to sleep.</p>
<p>Electrostatic disinfectant sprayers, a campus air filtration system enhanced with virus-removing ionizers, and nearly 500 trained "pandemic safety officers" are just a few of Carnegie Mellon University's COVID-19-related expenses.</p>
<p>At the University of Pittsburgh, the cost of doing business now includes a 5,000-square-foot climate-controlled classroom "tent" on the Cathedral of Learning lawn, and $22 million in hotel rooms in Oakland to help reduce campus dorm occupancy.</p>
<p>Then there's Penn State University, with 2,000 buildings on campuses statewide, requiring thousands of hand sanitizer stations, not to mention enough virus testing for random, daily checks of almost 50,000 students, plus employees, on the University Park campus alone.</p>
<p>Even as arguments rage over the wisdom of bringing students to campus in a pandemic —&nbsp;and who is to blame if it all falls apart —&nbsp;students, parents and colleges at least agree on this: They worry what it all will cost and if help is coming to pay the bills.</p>
<p>The American Council on Education, an umbrella group for colleges and universities, in July estimated the cost to higher education of reopening safely at $120 billion —&nbsp;with costs incurred so far ranging from residence hall refunds to retrofitting classrooms for online instruction. Many Pennsylvania campuses developed intricate and expensive reopen plans for fall, only to revise them as virus cases spiked this summer, driving a greater share of instruction online, and forcing many students to stay home.</p>
<p>Forecasting who would show up and enroll, go elsewhere or be unable to afford college at all given massive job losses also helped make campus budgeting as predictable as the virus itself.&nbsp;"It's like trying to put a rubber band around jello. It's very fluid," said Molly Mercer, Slippery Rock University's chief financial officer.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 26px; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; color: #444444; font-weight: bold; display: block; margin-bottom: 8px;">Federal funds sent to colleges, students</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-style: italic; color: #444444; display: block; margin-bottom: 14px;">The federal government through The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act offered more than $6 billion in emergency grants to college students facing hardship due to COVID-19 in the spring semester, as well as aid to institutions. Here's how much money was sent to the region's colleges so far.</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-weight: bold; display: block; margin-bottom: 8px; color: #444444;">TOTAL SPRING ALLOCATIONS OF CARES ACT FUNDING PER SCHOOL:</span></p>
<p>Both the minimum allocation to be awarded for emergency financial aid grants to students and the maximum allocation for institutional costs is equal to half of the school’s total allocated funds.</p>
<p>In April, the federal government allocated about $13 billion for college and university stimulus funding under the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security or (CARES) Act.</p>
<p>Half of it was in grants to students. Many already were struggling to pay tuition and rent before the pandemic hit. Suddenly, they faced expenses such as laptops and WiFi hotspots as campuses shut down mid-semester and instruction shifted online.</p>
<p>A potential sequel to the CARES Act is before Congress.</p>
<p>But opinions of what more federal assistance should look like differ, and multiple visions for higher education assistance have emerged. One advanced by Senate Republicans, the $29 billion Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection and Schools or (HEALS) Act, also includes a $5 billion fund for states that governors can direct as they see fit, some potentially for higher education.</p>
<p>That's billions less than the Democrat-majority House version, passed two months earlier in May. It's called the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions or (HEROES) Act, and it earmarks $37 billion to higher education.</p>
<p>The American Council on Education is seeking $47 billion, an amount it says is a fraction of what campuses are spending to hold classes while combating the virus. Its president, Ted Mitchell, drove home the complexity of the problem to senators this summer.</p>
<p>“A framework like that allows districts to think critically about so why are we buying technology?” Mr. Mitchell said. “Is it something that can make teaching better for students?</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/newsletters" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2019/06/03/BOPnewsletterinsert" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p>"Unfortunately, the amount of higher education aid contained in this legislation is inadequate to address the extensive needs of millions of students and families struggling to cope with lost jobs or reduced wages, and colleges and universities (that are) reeling from lost revenues and increased costs."</p>
<p><strong>Costs adding up</strong></p>
<p>A letter that Mr. MItchell sent to a Senate committee listed varied physical changes and labor costs, large and small.</p>
<p>The expenses included retrofitting classrooms for virtual instruction, e-proctoring for exams, reconfigured dining halls, COVID-19 test kits (self-administered saliva and administered swab tests), additional card- access equipment for buildings, quarantine housing for students, Plexiglas sneeze guards and forehead temperature scanners.</p>
<p>At Pitt and Penn State, estimated costs and revenue losses by summer had already reached tens of millions of dollars. An additional blow to Penn State and businesses around State College was the postponement of the Big 10 football season, and lost revenue every game day that the 106,500-seat Beaver Stadium sits empty.</p>
<p>Smaller campuses face losses, too.&nbsp;Robert Morris University, for instance, has been unable for months to host external gatherings at its year-old UPMC Events Center with its 4,000-seat arena. Its Island Sports Center is only partially open.</p>
<p>"We would welcome relief to offset the revenue losses both those venues have experienced," RMU spokesman Jonathan Potts said.</p>
<p>The school hired an additional full-time nurse for its health center and, like other campuses, needed personal protective equipment, signage to promote and enforce social distancing, additional cleanings and changes to its heating, ventilation and air conditioning system to allow for more fresh air.</p>
<p>At Slippery Rock, the university has installed smart conference cameras from Somerville, Mass.-based Owl Labs that can follow a professor around a classroom, It's part of $500,000 in technology acquired so classes can be delivered remotely in whole or in part, said Ms. Mercer.</p>
<p><strong>Grants for students</strong></p>
<p>The spring CARES Act funding came weeks after the pandemic had forced campuses to shutter and left schools scrambling to educate students remotely. The student grants were for "expenses related to disruptions to their educations due to the COVID-19 outbreak, including things like course materials and technology as well as food, housing, health care, and child care," stated U.S. Department of Education rules.</p>
<p>Campus allotments were 75%-based on how many Pell-eligible students attended, along with other criteria including total undergraduate and graduate population and how much instruction on campus already was being delivered online.</p>
<p>Need was stressed as a criteria for the awards, which were intended to exceed the Pell Grant maximum award of the past year of $6,195. Schools could make allocation decisions that affected award size and over how many students the grants were spread.</p>
<p>“Some colleges are spreading it evenly among all their students, partly because they argue that everybody is affected and partly because it is easier to implement, getting the money to the students quicker,” Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and vice president for research at Savingforcollege.com said at the time.</p>
<p>At Pitt, the region's largest campus, officials opted to disperse $10.6 million to assist 11,400 students facing hardship with grants between $500 and $1,000 based on need.</p>
<p>Slippery Rock received $3.7 million and has expended all but about $300,000 in grants of $500 to $1,500 for about 4,500 students.</p>
<p>At Carlow University, officials including President Suzanne Mellon said emergency grants to some 513 students, generally from about $500 to $2,000, helped keep those students enrolled and progressing toward degrees.</p>
<p>Like leaders at other campuses, she expressed hope the government will move swiftly to provide the aid needed to students and to schools so they can help revive the economy. Releasing the money is important "so students can continue on with their career goals and career path, and the university can provide that."</p>
