<h1>Kuntu Repertory founder Vernell Lillie was Pittsburgh's 'queen mother of black theater'  </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Kuntu Repertory Theatre closed for good in 2013, Sala Udin crowned its founder and artistic director, Dr. Vernell A. Lillie, with a well-earned title.</p>
<p>"She was the queen mother of black theater in this city," said Mr. Udin, a former city council member, activist and actor.</p>
<p>Ms. Lillie was 81 at the time, and Kuntu had been her baby for nearly 40 years.</p>
<p>The professor emeritus in Africana Studies, who founded Kuntu Rep as an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh, had suffered from dementia in recent years. She died Monday morning, on her 89th birthday.</p>
<p>The award-winning theater company came into being in 1974, as a way of exploring black life from a sociopolitical-historical perspective and as a showcase for the work of poet, playwright and professor Rob Penny, a founding member of Pitt’s Department of Africana Studies.</p>
<p>The company was Dr. Lillie’s baby, and she helped to raise up several generations of black artists in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“A life-changing influence,” is how she is described by Dr. Renee Berry Mack, former president of the Kuntu board and a talent management solutions specialist at NOVA Chemicals, Inc. “Dr. Lillie stretched me beyond the stage to be a change agent, to reach for possibilities not yet seen and drive for excellence under the legacy of our people.”</p>
<p>It was Penny who brought August Wilson into the Kuntu fold with “Homecoming” in 1975 — Wilson’s first play to be produced by a resident company — directed by Dr. Lillie.</p>
<p>Fiercely protective of her art and her flock, she took great pleasure in nurturing Pittsburgh’s black theater artists, such as Montae Russell, Lamman Rucker and Monteze Freeland, as well as budding scholars.</p>
<p>"Listen, I think I got about five Ph.D's who started at Kuntu,” <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2013/04/24/Curtain-falls-on-Pittsburgh-s-Kuntu-Repertory-Theatre/stories/201304240163" target="_blank">she told the Post-Gazette in her exit interview in 2013,</a> when Kuntu closed up shop.</p>
<p>Many of those she influenced or set on a theatrical path, which was paved with her wisdom and work ethic, referred to her as Dr. Lillie long into their relationship.</p>
<p>On Monday, she was mourned by Mark Clayton Southers, founder and artistic producer of Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company.</p>
<p>“You gave me a chance,” he wrote in a Facebook post. “You instilled in me and many others the confidence to walk boldly into this cold world with fire! You exposed us to the works of Rob Penny whose love and respect for women was set at such a high height that it keeps us all reaching for perfection. You gave ALL of yourself to the world of theatre, and the legions of the community that you’ve created at Kuntu are forever grateful for your existence. Rest well Doc, rest well.”</p>
<p>Vernell Audrey Watson Lillie was born on May 11, 1931, in Hempstead, Texas, and was well-traveled on her way to a doctorate in English from Carnegie Mellon University in 1972. Before arriving in Pittsburgh, she earned a B.A. in speech and drama from Dillard University in New Orleans and went on to graduate studies at Texas Southern University.</p>
<p>She taught speech and drama at Worthing High School and Phylis Wheatley High School in the Houston Independent School District for 19 years. During that time, she produced and directed theatrical productions with student actors, whom she mentored — a practice that continued at Pitt. She acted in local theatrical productions, playing Mama in “A Raisin in the Sun,” and was a member of the Black Theatre Movement in Houston in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>In 1969, she moved with her late husband Richard L. “Dickie Boy” Lillie Jr. and daughter Marsha “Hisani” Lillie to pursue doctoral studies at CMU. Dr. Lillie joined the Pitt faculty 1972 and was an associate professor of Africana Studies until her retirement in 2006.</p>
<p>Kuntu remained part of Pitt’s Department of Africana Studies until 2011, beginning what would be its final season in a new home at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh's Homewood Auditorium in 2012.</p>
<p>"I inherited some property in Texas from my great-grandfather, and I sold 46 acres to finance the last few plays," Dr. Lillie told the Post-Gazette about her decision to close the company in 2013.</p>
<p>She tried to hold onto Kuntu after leaving Pitt, but she said finally, "It's been a long time, a hard struggle, and I have to face reality."</p>
<p>Dr. Lillie led Kuntu to several Onyx and People's Choice awards from the African American Council of Theatre. She was the recipient of the University of Pittsburgh Chancellor’s Distinguished Teaching Award; the Outstanding Award for Women in the Arts by Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., the 2003 Career Achievement in Education Award from the Association for Theatre in Higher Education, the Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Black Theatre Festival in 2005 and the Pennsylvania Governor’s Creative Community Award in 2006.</p>
<p>In 1999, then-Post-Gazette theater critic Christopher Rawson named her one of the closing century's<a href="http://old.post-gazette.com/magazine/19991229rawson6.asp" target="_blank"> 10 most significant theatrical Pittsburghers</a>, along with George S. Kaufman, Gene Kelly, Will Disney, Frederick Burleigh and August Wilson.</p>
<p>She also received numerous awards for her creative expression through the arts, her work with seniors and young people, and for her activism in education and the theatre arts. Her biography is included in The HistoryMakers Digital Archive, the country’s largest video oral history collection of African Americans.</p>
<p>As Dr. Lillie was leaving Kuntu behind, she said she did so knowing that “black theater in Pittsburgh will be fine,” noting New Horizon Theater, led by Joyce Meggerson-Moore, and Mr. Southers’ Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre.</p>
<p>"You've still got Mark here. Joyce is going to be all right. This is not sad,” Ms. Lillie said. “I had a good run.”</p>
<p>A few years ago, her family arranged for the voluminous Kuntu Theatre archive, which is perforce the Vernell Lillie archive, as well, to be given to the Ford Curtis Theater Collection at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Charisse Lillie said her mother will be buried beside her father in her native Texas. She and her sister, Marsha, were planning for services in two states, but they were unsure how that would work in this time of COVID-19.</p>
<p>On Monday night, when news of her passing had just been announced, more than six dozen of Dr. Lillie’s former students, colleagues and admirers gathered in an impromptu three-hour Zoom meeting to honor her memory.</p>
<p>One after another, from many walks of life, they described how “Doc” had been central to their lives by leading them to believe in themselves.</p>
<p>Andre Harrington, president of the National Black Theatre Network, celebrated her as one of its founders, 35 years ago. “Vernell was a force, always to be reckoned with. She allowed us to be who we are.”</p>
<p>Eileen Morris, artistic director of the Ensemble Theatre in Houston, Texas, who spent 10 years at Kuntu, working alongside Dr. Lillie, read the Maya Angelou poem, “Phenomenal Woman,” and changed one small part:</p>
<p><em>“I’m a woman /&nbsp;Phenomenally. /&nbsp;Phenomenal woman, /&nbsp;That’s … Vernell Audrey Watson Lillie.”</em></p>
<p>Dr. Lillie was preceded in death by her husband, jazz musician and educator Richard L. Lillie Jr., and her sister,&nbsp;Walta Delle Watson Timmon. She is survived by her daughters Charisse R. Lillie of Philadelphia (Thomas L. McGill, Jr.) and Dr. Marsha Lillie-Blanton of Washington, D.C. (Thomas Blanton), six grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. The family requests that donations in honor of Dr. Lillie be made to the Black Theatre Network (Blacktheatrenetwork.org), in care of Renee Charlow, Business Manager, 8306 Bluebird Way, Lorton, VA 22079.</p>
