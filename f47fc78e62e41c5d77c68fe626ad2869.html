<h1>Penguins winger Brandon Tanev ready to bring 'edge' and energy to postseason</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last summer, Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford began looking at his club with a critical eye. A first-round postseason sweep fell far short of expectations. One of Rutherford’s main critiques? Some players were just a little too comfortable.</p>
<p>Insert Brandon Tanev.</p>
<p>An energizer bunny on skates, the 28-year-old winger earned <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/07/01/brandon-tanev-penguins-nhl-free-agency/stories/201907010088" target="_blank">a six-year deal</a> thanks to his ability to do just the opposite, make himself and opponents uncomfortable. He’s near the top of the NHL leader board in some of the most cringeworthy stats. He’s fourth in the league in hits dished out with 244, second among forwards in hits absorbed with 171 and 10th among forwards in blocked shots with 65.</p>
<p>That mentality changed the makeup of the team.</p>
<p>“He’s had such a great influence on the group, both in the locker room and on the ice,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “On the ice, he helped us recapture some of our team speed. He brings some bite and some edge to his game — a physical dimension that makes us harder to play against.”</p>
<p>Off the ice?</p>
<p>“His personality and energy off the ice has been a welcome addition,” Sullivan continued. “He’s a popular guy in our locker room. I know his teammates have a lot of respect for him.”</p>
<p>While Tanev, who recorded 11 goals and 14 assists in 68 games, proved to be worth the investment during the regular season, this is the time of year when his value will be highlighted even more.</p>
<p>Postseason hockey celebrates the sadistic side of the sport. Block shots. Kill penalties. Play hurt. Play your role. No team enjoys the first sip from the Stanley Cup without doing those little things. They’re also the areas in which Tanev excels.</p>
<p>“It’s a job that isn’t well liked around the league,” Tanev said. “But shot-blocking and penalty killing is a huge part of today’s game. You have to do whatever it takes. If that means stepping in front of somebody’s shot and eating a puck for the guys, that’s part of the job and part of the role when you go out there to penalty kill.”</p>
<p>This unique postseason adds another wrinkle. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/07/18/crowd-noise-empty-stadiums-pirates-steelers-penguins-riverhounds-fifa-pitt-cmu/stories/202007170002" target="_blank">In empty arenas</a>, players can’t feed off the momentum of 30,000 fans waving towels. They’ll have to bring their own juice. Patric Hornqvist and Tanev are two of the Penguins whom coaches and players expect to be near the top of the list in that department.</p>
<p>Even in pregame games of soccer, Tanev is the one chirping teammates and insisting he’s the best.</p>
<p>“He brings a whole ton of energy, both on and off the ice,” Bryan Rust said. “I think every team needs guys like that.”</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Tanev has been skating with Teddy Blueger and Zach Aston-Reese during training camp. That “fourth line,” if you want to call it that, has developed a clear identity as a tight-checking, hard-to-play against trio. They have, by far, the most defensive-zone starts on the team and are often deployed to snuff out the opponent’s most-potent offensive line.</p>
<p>During the last four months, Tanev evidently got a jump-start on his playoff beard. At first glance, he could be mistaken for defenseman Kris Letang with some flow coming out of the back of his helmet and scruff on his chin.</p>
<p>He sure looks ready for the postseason. Chances are, once the games start Aug.1 in Toronto, he’ll sound like it too.</p>
