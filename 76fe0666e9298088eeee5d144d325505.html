<p>BEIJING — China reported another rise in coronavirus cases Monday, amid government reminders for people to “remain alert and step up personal protection against the virus.”</p>
<p>The warning from Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission, came as 17 new cases were reported, up from 14 the day before, which had represented the first double-digit increase in 10 days. Of the 17 new cases, seven were listed as imported, while five were in the city of Wuhan, where a strict lockdown was lifted last month.</p>
<p>At a Sunday news conference, Mi renewed calls for people to avoid social gatherings and to “seek medical advice or testing in designated hospitals if they exhibit symptoms such as fever, cough or fatigue.” Despite that, Beijing on Monday sent 82,000 third-year middle school students back to classes to prepare for their high school entrance exams.</p>

<p>Also on Monday, the National Health Commission said there had been no new COVID-19 deaths, extending that streak to almost a month, and 141 people remained hospitalized in treatment. Another 783 people were under isolation and observation for being suspected cases or for having tested positive without showing any symptoms.</p>
<p>Monday’s news comes a day after — for the first time in more than a month — the National Health Commission reported that a person in Wuhan, where the global pandemic is believed to have originated, has tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
<p>Local health officials reportedly said the patient had previously been asymptomatic.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how the man contracted the disease, which had seemingly died out in the area, but his wife and several other people in the community were being tested.</p>
<p>Also, the health authorities in northeast China reported a new cluster of cases in a town near the Russian border, a flare-up that shows the continuing difficulties in stopping the coronavirus even for countries that have been largely successful in curbing infections.</p>
<p>Eleven new cases were recorded on Saturday in the town of Shulan in Jilin Province. They were traced to a 45-year-old woman who was confirmed to be infected on Thursday, but health officials were still trying to determine how she had contracted the virus.</p>
<p>China has reported 4,633 deaths from the virus among 82,918 cases.</p>
