<h1>Protest underway in Downtown Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hundreds of people are marching through Downtown Pittsburgh to protest police brutality after the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in police custody.</p>
<p>The protestors — most masked because of the COVID-19 precautions — shouted “I can’t breathe” and “This is for George” as they marched.</p>
<p>The Downtown Pittsburgh protest began around 2:30 p.m. starting at 6th and Liberty Streets.</p>
<p>Saturday marks the first large-scale public protest in Pittsburgh in response to Mr. Floyd’s death. A smaller protest took place earlier Saturday in Sewickley.</p>
<p>More than a dozen U.S. cities experienced violent or destructive protests Friday night.&nbsp;Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee into George Floyd’s neck, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter.</p>
<p>As anger over Mr. Floyd’s killing on Monday spread to cities nationwide, local leaders increasingly said they could need help from National Guardsmen or even military police to contain the unrest.</p>
<p>Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler also declared an emergency and ordered a nighttime curfew for the city.</p>
<p>Another 500 Guard soldiers were mobilized in and around Minneapolis, where Mr. Floyd died and an officer faced charges Friday in his death. But after another night of watching fires burn and businesses ransacked, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said early Saturday that he was moving to activate more than 1,000 more and was considering federal help.</p>
<p>The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia, where a crowd grew outside the White House and chanted curses at President Donald Trump.</p>
