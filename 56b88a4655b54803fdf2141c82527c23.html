<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 05.06.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, get ready because our chat will start in about 5-10 minutes.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, here we go....</p>
<p><strong>Tprod</strong>: Gerry, the Steelers have serious depth issues at ILB and safety. Without OTAs and potentially a reduced training camp, rookies are not a viable option. Any veteran FAs who might fit the bill? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I wouldn't call it serious at safety. After all, that's why they drafted Antoine Brooks -- that is, if he's a safety and not a hybrid linebacker, in which case that helps at that position. But that is a big leap of faith for a sixth-round draft choice. Right now, it appears they will replace Mark Barron's 750 snaps with a committee of Vince Williams, Ulysees Gilbert III, Brooks and possibly Marcus Allen.</p>
<p><strong>Bob in NEPA</strong>: Thanks for keeping these going, these chats are comfort food that we need. Question on salary cap for 2021 and beyond. Will this year of probably lower revenue due to possible no-fans in seats have a significant impact on 2021 cap? Are metrics such it could actually go down? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. Not having fans will hurt concessions more than anything else, not ticket revenue. That's because season-ticket holders have already paid for their seat license, which is the bulk of that revenue, plus will be required to buy tickets as season-ticket holders in the event there are games with fans. If fans are not allowed, that money spent on tickets for 2020 will likely be applied to season tickets for 2021. It will have no effect on the salary cap.</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong>: With V Williams another year older and already susceptible in coverage, would it not make sense to bring Mark Barron back at a reduced rate (assuming he'll take that) to add to the speed in the middle of the defense? If not, is there someone not currently on the roster that would make sense to bring in? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I have been told they will not bring Mark Barron back. The problem was not Barron's cap hit, per se, it was that he practiced only one day a week last year because of nagging injuries and never got comfortable in their defense because of it. I don't think they will go down that road again.</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: ok genius, isn't ben's contract one of the worst if not of all time given to any steeler player of all time ? a stat for remembering, 1 touchdown pass in his 2 super bowl wins !!!!! i'm ready for your answer, but its NO, another wise answer because you , the media love the guy !!!! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: What was that you said...two Super Bowl WINS???</p>
<p><strong>Brandon</strong>: Will we sign a FA ILB or Safety? Depth is pretty bad. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think there is a good chance you will see them sign a veteran safety as a backup, but not until they return to some form of practice.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sue</strong>: Gerry with your connections I want to know, was Brooks Jr the guy we were trying to get when you mentioned the team tried to trade into the fifth round or which player was it ? Now be good and stay safe yourself! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't know if that is the case or not. All I know is they tried to trade into the fifth round to get a pick in that round and were unsuccessful.</p>
<p><strong>Vico</strong>: Hi Gerry! I know is not going to happen, but isn't Carlos Hyde a good veteran option for the Steelers at RB? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't have a problem with Hyde as a player, they are just not going to add another RB at this point, especially after McFarland was injured. Plus Hyde, Conner and Snell are basically the same mix/type of player.</p>
<p><strong>Lucky</strong>: Need a decent backup to Minkah at FS. Would the Steelers look at a veteran FA like a Tavon Wilson to bring in? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not saying it would be Wilson, but I could see that type of player -- 30 years old, a decent number of NFL starts -- as a possible backup to sign.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Cook via KY</strong>: Could you ever see a day when the Rooney family sells out and the city buys the team. Ala Green Bay. As the generations go by, the tree of heirs grows, potentially making any one Rooney not being able to own a controlling share. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I do not see that happening, based on their family history.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Cook via KY</strong>: I’ve always thought the Dapp Dan dinner would be a cool way to meet Pittsburgh athletes from back in the day. I’m guessing you may have gone before. Is it worth the trip and cash. I’m from Pittsburgh but live in Ky. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Hey, Scott, I'm not going to tell you how to spend your money or promise that you will meet some former athletes, but they do attend the dinner and I think there are some opportunities to meet them. I have not attended the dinner in years so it's difficult for me to tell you yes or no.</p>
<p><strong>Reynolds</strong>: How would you grade the division on paper for Fun? I would go first so you see I am Fair: Ravens A+ Browns B+ Bengals B+ Steelers B ( Minkah Not Included).. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm sure your criteria for your grades, but whatever it is it's suspect and totally baseless .... unless you're having fun. Ravens, yes, an A. But the Browns and Bengals deserve nothing above a D, based on their performance. Just for fun</p>
<p><strong>TicketNICK</strong>: Do the Steelers plan on hosting sellout crowds for home games this year? Or, will there be some form of social distancing? If not, what are their intentions for season ticket holders? Have the Steelers discussed the availability for season ticket holders to defer their tickets? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That will be up to the individual, not the team, if fans are allowed to attend the game. But, if fans are allowed, I'm sure the league will have guidelines for all teams to follow to ensure safe distancing. As to your latter point about deferring, I don't know that and, to be honest, is the first time I've heard about that.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Cook via KY</strong>: In baseball, it’s common for all teams to use high level Math/Statistics to build and manage their teams. No way football teams aren’t doing this. At least I’d think they would. I’ve never read much about how they crunch the numbers to predict or develops a successful team. Is their a story there? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Like a lot of teams, the Steelers use metrics to help test and monitor a player's health, speed, breathing, etc. But they do not use it to help build a team or an organization, if you are suggesting they adopt the Moneyball philosophy. Whatever it is they do, they should keep doing it. They are the league's most successful organization since the 1970s. It's like the line from "When Harry Met Sally" -- I'll have what she's having.</p>
<p><strong>Barbie</strong>: Mr Gerry how do you see the division playing out if there is a season? I really think the Browns finally have a Team now and are going to give headaches to the Ravens and also to us, the Ravens look unstoppable and I think we have a great defense and a really championship offense with all the weapons we have and Big Ben back, it all depends on our OL in my view.. your Thoughts Please! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Oh, the Browns will be a headache all right -- to their fans. Until they go out and prove it, history suggests they will not be a serious factor and to think otherwise is naive. The Ravens are good, they proved that, but the Steelers getting BR back with their defense changes the entire complexion of the division.</p>
<p><strong>The Eman</strong>: No question - just wanted to tell you I loved the line from last week’s chat about Cain being more than able! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Pay the man!!</p>
<p><strong>Scott Cook via KY</strong>: Did you ever interview Don Shula? Any thoughts about the man? He seemed like the real deal!! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes. Nice man.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Cook via KY</strong>: What is Art Rooney II ‘s son doing in the organization now? I expect he will be the owner in 10 years or so. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He is obtaining his masters.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: Will Pouncey and Ben both be gone after 2021? Dawson played until he was 35, Harting until he was 34. Pouncey will only be 32. Will he really leave that much money on the table to ride into the sunset with Ben? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's still to be determined because that's two more seasons from now.</p>
<p><strong>Rory</strong>: Gerry...are there any Steelers who are on your level as a golfer? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It depends what level you consider my game.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Cook via KY</strong>: Gerry, ever remember a great Steeler who just had trouble learning the playbook? I ask because it seems like every year, we talk about how difficult it is for anyone coming in to the team and learning everything. I wonder if the playbook has ruined anybody’s career? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't know if it ever ruined someone's career, but I think the playbook has definitely slowed or stalled someone's development. There are more of those than players who never had a problem learning the playbook.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I know they have certain personal for the play they have in mind but for chat purposes, answer this for me. When we are in 2TE, ! RB, 2 WR sets, who are the WR's who will get the most playing time when we are in that personal ? And when we are in 3 WR sets, which 3 WR's will get the most playing time when we are in that personal? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Jake...for chat purposes?? What do I look like, the offensive coordinator??? OK, here ya go....In "21," that two TEs and one RB, it will be McDonald, Ebron and Conner, and the WRs will be JuJu and Washington or Johnson. In 3 WRs (or Kings), it will be JuJu and some twosome of Johnson/Washington/Claypool. But they mix and match personnel so frequently that is never etched in stone. In some two TE, two wide sets, they might use a blocking WR if they want to run the ball.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Lynn</strong>: Hey Gerry...with all the talk about finding a backup to Big Ben, I’m concerned about the third string quarterback. Does Duck have the job or will Barrett or others be given a chance to win it? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Duck does not have the job. As of right now, I think Paxton Lynch will be the third guy. I don't think Barrett has a chance at all.</p>
<p><strong>BPOS</strong>: Hi Gerry, was wondering what percentage of time you think we'll see Claypool on the field in the first part of the season. I suspect we'll see a lot of him in redzone opportunities. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I agree, but you will see him. They don't draft guys with their top pick and have them sit around. They will work him in some specific packages.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Gerry - would you say now that WR is a team strength with JuJu, Diontae, Washington, and Claypool? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I would say it's a position with a lot of good young talent.</p>
<p><strong>Alan F</strong>: Read an article this week regarding Bill Cowher tried to court Dan Marino 20 years ago to come out of retirement to play for Pittsburgh. Was that true? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Who wrote that?</p>
<p><strong>fredward</strong>: Who is most likely to start and finish the year at left guard for the Steelers? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Good question. It might not be the same player.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Are we set with the starters for the upcoming season and just need some depth players or is there still a position of need in terms of a starter. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Really, the only starting position in question is ILB -- who will play the majority of time next to Devin Bush? Right now, Vince Williams will be the starter. But you saw last year how little they used him (just 36.5 percent of the time) because of coverage concerns. So I don't think he will all of a sudden play 750 snaps such as Barron did last year. And I think it will be curious to see how and with whom they replace Hargrave. Not so much when they are in their base package -- Chris Wormley can rotate in as one of the two D-linemen -- but in the few times they play their base 3-4. Right now, the NT will be Tyson Alualu. Other than the two studs -- Heyward and Tuitt -- I would not consider the D-line to be a strength at all.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Gerry - I am assuming the picks in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th round will make the team. What is the likelihood that Antoine Brooks or Carlos Davis makes the team? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'd say pretty good. Unless the guys are bust, they like to give their draft choices a chance. There is definitely a spot for Brooks. Davis might be a practice squad, unless they part ways with Dan McCullers.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: If the Steelers were ever selected for Hard Knocks, even though he would never admit it, do you think Tomlin would secretly enjoy it? He's great in front of the camera, great with a quote. Side note -- would you embrace it, or would it make it harder to do your job? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You're right, he would never admit it. And, you might be right, he might secretly enjoy it. Me? Hate to tell you, I've NEVER watched the show, so it holds no appeal for me.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph LA</strong>: Have you ever interviewed an athlete (like Boswell) that’s overcome the yips? That could be inspirational or instructional to some of your weekend warrior readership. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Boswell's turnaround is one of the best if not remarkable I've ever see. Went from missing more kicks than anyone in the league in 2018 to missing fewer kicks than anyone in the league in 2019. That was his track record before 2018. The 2018 season was an uncharacteristic anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Gerry, i am amazed at how quickly our fans give up on JuJu! They also dont think he is fast enough. He has undoubtedly 3 of the longest plays in Steeler history along with a 76 yarder last year. Let us give him some credit. I think he will be back in a big way. btw no one ever catches him from behind....that is fast. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: JuJu is competitive football fast. You're right, he has never been caught from behind. JuJu's detractors are those who are annoyed by his social-media antics, most of which are self-serving to appeal to his YouTube audience. I get that. There are those in the organziation who don't like it, either. But JuJu is a good player and they know it. The idea they will not re-sign him, unless he becomes a total washout in 2020, is unfounded.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: where is all the talk coming from about getting rid of juju <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: See above answer</p>
<p><strong>Ralph LA</strong>: What’s the plan for nose tackle? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Good question. See earlier answer for clarity. But, remember, they use a NT in their 3-4 defense about 25 percent of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Colby</strong>: JJ Watt becomes a FA after the 2021 season and will be 33 years old in 2022. Derek Watt will be entering the final season of his 3-year deal and assuming TJ Watt signs long-term next offseason, will also be under contract... the stars seem to be aligning. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes....I see Derek Watt joining J.J. in Houston!! Is that what you meant...????</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: Is this crazy to say: Assuming everyone is healthy, the Steelers are one of the most complete teams in the NFL right now. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not crazy at all. They have eight studs on defense and at least five on offense, assuming all are healthy. The weakest area is the depth on the defensive line, but the two DEs are studs -- Heyward and Tuitt.</p>
<p><strong>Jonah</strong>: Hello Gerry. If /when the NFL season starts without the players being vaccinated, what recourse if any does a player have if he does not want to play for fear of getting the virus? Thank you. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I do not know what protection the players association has relative to the virus concerns, but I guess the player can always claim he has an injury and is unable to play.</p>
<p><strong>J Daven</strong>: When does the NFL rearrange the divisions? Do you think it is time to do so again, and why? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. And why? Why should they? What don't you like??</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Hi Gerry, hope you're staying safe. Who needs to have the bigger year 19, 30, 48 or 34? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Based on your question, which is implying these players have to step up their game from last season -- what more do you want to expect from Dupree after the season he had last year? JuJu will be/should be improved just by having No. 7 back. Conner needs to have a 2018 year again to get an extension. But Edmunds needs to show why he was a No. 1 draft choice. He didn't make the big jump expected of him last season.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: Gerry, Do the Steelers look at drafting a QB in next years draft? You like any of the QB's coming out next year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That makes more sense than taking one this year. Those people who thought they would draft one this year with the second pick had no clue what the Steelers were targeting. None. And if they thought they did, they were being duped and didn't know it.</p>
<p><strong>Bigedbarr71</strong>: Hey Gerry. Hope all is well. I wish people would get it through their minds! MR is our backup QB &amp; a pretty good one at that! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Big Ed for three!!!</p>
<p><strong>Bigedbarr71</strong>: That Marino quote about Cowher was written by Ed B. On The Athletic. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ahhhh, I'll defer to my former colleague, if, in fact, that's what he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Zack</strong>: You mentioned signing a FA safety, how about a FA ILB that can cover to play next to Bush? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: How's that worked out the past couple years? Bostic. Burnett. Barron. Killer B's they were not.</p>
<p><strong>Jake</strong>: Gerry, JuJu is not a No. 1 WR. Good No 2 but needs someone to take the coverage away to give him space. Sound about right to you? Thank you. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's what we wll find out if 7 stays healthy. Won't argue the point. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: And my former colleague confirms he did in fact write that. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: And, with that, let's end our extended chat. Back next week for more. Bye now.</p>
