<h1>Area state senators line up along party lines in vote to reopen parts of economy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Serving as vocal proxies for their parties’ rhetorical messaging, state senators from Western Pennsylvania united behind partisan lines in a contentious vote Wednesday on legislation that could reopen large segments of the state’s economy in the midst of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Given the chance to speak before the vote in the Senate, Republicans from the region —&nbsp;who joined their GOP colleagues across the state in passing the legislation and sending it to Gov. Tom Wolf’s desk —&nbsp;framed the bill as an effort to give local officials more control over the businesses that are allowed to operate in their communities, as well as an attempt to make the Wolf administration provide more justification for its waiver process.</p>
<p>“We haven’t stopped the virus from coming across state,” said Sen. Kim Ward, R-Hempfield. “It’s not going to come any quicker ... just because we give the local officials a little bit of input.”</p>

<p>Democrats from the Pittsburgh area and surrounding counties, including Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, argued that stakeholders must continue to take steps to mitigate the spread of the virus — and that reopening businesses would be premature and against the recommendations of public health experts.</p>
<p>Mr. Costa, D-Forest Hills, read into the record a letter from Secretary of Health Rachel Levine, in which she warned that the legislation would have a “devastating impact” and weaken the effectiveness of the state’s mitigation efforts.</p>
<p>“When we have a better handle on the testing ... and our health experts agree we can safely begin restarting our economy, and phasing in our economy, then and only then will I not stand in the way of legislation that will assist to do that,” Mr. Costa said, “and our caucus will not stand in the way of that as well.”</p>
<p>Joining the Republican caucus in its unanimous vote to approve the legislation was Sen. Camera Bartolotta, who said the Wolf administration’s waiver process has been&nbsp;“haphazard,” has lacked transparency and has caused confusion for businesses.</p>
<p>Ms. Bartolotta, R-Monongahela, who insisted she’d feel safer if county officials were making decisions about reopening businesses and enforcing guidelines, said the bill would&nbsp;“continue to protect lives without sacrificing the livelihoods of more than a million workers.”</p>
<p>To Democratic Sen. Lindsey Williams, reopening businesses is&nbsp;“not the answer” to a waiver process that she said she’s been equally frustrated by. Transitioning the economy should only happen based on consultation with medical experts and scientific data, she added.</p>
<p>Ms. Williams, D-West View, also noted that the bill proposed no penalties for employers who don’t follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines — adding that she’s heard from workers who say their employers are not doing enough to protect them.</p>
<p>Some of those workers convened a conference call Wednesday morning, warning that reopening non-essential businesses would post an immediate danger to public health and endanger frontline workers who don’t have enough protective equipment already.</p>
<p>On the call, Darrin Kelly, president of the Allegheny-Fayette Labor Council, said no one wants to return to work more than the 60,000 Allegheny County workers who have been laid off or furloughed, but that they want to go back when it’s safe and when the country is prepared to protect them.</p>
<p>“We can’t put a timeline on this return,” Mr. Kelly said. “We have to let the experts decide on how this goes. ... It must be slow, it must be deliberate to where we can actually set the base for our society going forward.”</p>
<p>Asked about the legislation and efforts to give counties more control, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said he wants to continue to work together with the state and “follow the governor’s leadership,” adding that measures taken so far have worked to mitigate the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>“If we start to unwind that too quickly or don’t do it in a proper way, then that success is going to go the other way,” Mr. Fitzgerald warned, urging stakeholders to be “very careful about how we go back.”</p>
