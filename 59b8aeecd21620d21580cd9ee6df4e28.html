<p>Melvyn D. Johnson, 37, is accused of touching a girlâ€™s genitals when she was 7 or 8 years old in 2005 or 2006 at a home in Perry North, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>He is charged in that case with involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, endangering the welfare of children, corruption of minors, and two counts of indecent assault.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police interviewed the alleged victim in March.</p>
<p>In the second case, police said Johnson sent explicit texts to a 14-year-old girl in February, gave her marijuana, and offered to give her more pot if they had sex.</p>
<p>The girl did not accuse Johnson of any physical contact.</p>
