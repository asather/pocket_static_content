<h1>Paul Zeise: NFL should have learned from MLB and come to an agreement with players long ago</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The owners and players in Major League Baseball did everything possible to sabotage the season. They were engaged in long negotiations, had silly arguments about splitting money and how many games they wanted to play and seemed destined to run out of time before they could reach a deal to play a 2020 season.</p>
<p>Nobody could have imagined a league botching the negotiation process any worse than that. Then along came the NFL.</p>
<p>Seriously. The powers of MLB can at least somewhat argue that this is all new, that there wasn’t a lot of precedent for negotiations during a pandemic and thus they made some mistakes in hindsight they would have corrected.</p>
<p>What is the NFL’s excuse? They had a whole summer to watch MLB make every gaffe possible en route to finally getting a deal. They had a whole summer to watch the issues the NBA and NHL encountered, and they had a whole summer to sit down at the table and hammer out a deal that made sense for both the owners and players.</p>
<p>Instead, it is about a week from when training camps are supposed to begin and there is no reason to believe they will be on time. The two sides are still fighting about the number of preseason games, safety protocols and a number of other issues. There is a growing sense that not only will training camps be delayed, there might not be a season at all.</p>
<p>I am sure, much like with baseball, that at the final hour the two sides will make a deal and salvage the season. There is just too much money at stake for everyone involved for that not to happen. There is a lot of posturing going on right now, but both sides know what is at stake and will do what it takes to figure it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rams coach Sean McVay, though, shares similar thoughts with many in the game about it all, and that’s not a good thing.</p>
<p>"Usually when you get about a week out, and right now that's exactly where we're at, you start to get revved up, starting to get excited," McVay told ESPN.com. "And there's something about this time that you know the amount of things that have to take place for that to logistically get off and get going, something about it tells me maybe there's a chance that things get moved back."</p>
<p>McVay, like many others, is skeptical that it will get started on time, but he does believe there will be a regular season. Raiders owner Mark Davis is less sure and isn’t even certain that it is safe to play football during the pandemic. He said he is ready to accept the idea that there might not be a 2020 season or that it might start really late and be reduced.</p>
<p>Regardless, the first step was getting some sort of a deal together between the players association and the owners with regards to health and safety, which they started to do Monday evening by agreeing to testing protocols. The union has recently encouraged its players to report to camps on time and get tested but reserves the right to file a grievance if the health and safety issues&nbsp;“aren’t adequately addressed.”&nbsp;The players have not been shy about their thoughts on the current proposals as many have taken to social media to offer their displeasure with the NFL.</p>
<p>This isn’t likely to matter once the season begins, but the fact that it is something that is being talked about now is ridiculous. We should be talking about training camps, quarterback battles, first-year coaches, the Chiefs’ quest to repeat and instead we are talking about two sides fighting with each other even though they should be on the same page.</p>
<p>The NFLPA is right to fight for the player’s safety but they need to also understand that there is no way to make any activity 100 percent fully safe. And I would say the same thing even if there wasn’t a pandemic going on. If the players want a guarantee that there will be no risk at all, they may want to consider sitting it out.</p>
<p>The NFL will put the best protocols in place that are possible and do their best to keep the players safe. There are already a lot of safety measures in place and the league will continue to consult with medical professionals to keep their testing and safety procedures up to date. That’s not to say there won’t be hiccups but it is to say the NFL and NFLPA have generally had a good partnership and both sides need to trust each other a little bit on this one.</p>
<p>I don’t believe for one second that the NFL won’t at least do everything it can to have a season, but let’s hope they pull together a deal and get to training camps on time. It would be a major mistake if the NFL allowed this to go on much longer because as baseball found out, the good will of the fan base can sour quickly.</p>
