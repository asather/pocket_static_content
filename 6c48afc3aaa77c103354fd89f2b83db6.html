<h1>Paul Zeise: NCAA's 'one-time' transfer rule would not cause chaos</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Far too often college coaches create a fuss about certain issues they feel are going to cause chaos and threaten collegiate athletics. The latest is the one-time transfer rule that is almost assuredly going to pass this year and change the game for transfers.</p>
<p>The rule is simple —&nbsp;and correct I might add — as it would allow players to transfer once without having to fight for a release and without having to sit out a season. That would mean players who get caught in coaching changes can leave without having to sit out a season. It would mean players who get passed on the depth chart could transfer and not have to sit out. It would mean players who get home sick or just want to be closer to their families can transfer and not have to sit out.</p>
<p>I keep hearing about how it will turn college athletics into free agency and a wild free for all where everyone recruits everyone else’s players. That is silly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is already a surge of players exploring transfers since the transfer portal system was put in place. It is something coaches across the country seemingly whine about almost weekly.</p>
<p>The thing is, the number of actual transfers has basically held steady and most likely will start to decrease at some point. Too many players have found out over the years that the grass isn’t always greener somewhere else. And there just aren’t that many spots for all the players looking to transfer. Also, some coaches have started to take a more selective approach, and that will make it a little more difficult on transfer as well.</p>
<p>Pat Narduzzi earlier this week was the latest coach to bemoan the new rule and what it might do to college football. He actually said the transfer portal should be called the&nbsp;“the ugly toilet portal,” which is an entertaining line though I have no idea what that means.</p>
<p>Narduzzi’s thoughts on the transfer portal are not unique to him. They are actually shared by pretty much every coach I have heard speak on the topic. Coaches hate the transfer system.&nbsp;They spend a lot of time and resources recruiting and developing players, then just when they should be getting a payoff, the player leaves. And they hate having to give up some of the control they have when they make players beg and grovel for a release and dictate where they were and weren’t allowed to transfer.</p>
<p>If coaches really wanted to end the&nbsp;“epidemic” of transferring, they could do it real easily: Get together and commit to not accepting transfers from other four-year schools. That will never happen, though, because coaches often need to fill holes on their rosters, so every year they are all looking for transfers to come in and be quick fixes. And as long as coaches are so willing to take transfers, players will continue to do it.</p>
<p>More importantly, the new system of transfers will make it easier for coaches to clean their roster up and free up scholarships by ushering players out the door. They all claim they don’t want to do this, but they all do. There are times they evaluate a player poorly or a player doesn’t progress/fit and coaches need to find a way to push them off on someone else.</p>
<p>With transfer rules being made much more loose and the ability to transfer — and be recruited by other coaches while you are still at your school — it will be easier to move guys off the roster. Pitt basketball coach Jeff Capel seems to be one coach who gets this. He said on the 93.7 The Fan Morning Show that he will have to make some changes to the roster and some players currently at Pitt will need to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s not Capel being harsh, that’s Capel being real. And more coaches should embrace the rules because they will, as most rules do, work both ways. Yes, some players that coaches wanted to keep will leave, but for the most part the players who are playing the largest roles are the happiest ones and will stay put. On the flip side, though, it will be easier for coaches to plug holes.</p>
<p>The new proposed rule on transfers isn’t perfect, but it’s a big step in the right direction toward treating college athletes fairly.</p>
