<h1> Grand jury audio details raid that killed Breonna Taylor </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Police said they knocked and announced themselves for a minute or more before bursting into Breonna Taylor’s apartment, but her boyfriend said he did not hear officers identify themselves, according to Kentucky grand jury recordings released Friday. In the hail of gunfire that ensued, the 26-year-old Black woman was killed.</p>
<p>The dramatic and sometimes conflicting accounts of the March 13 raid are key to a case that has fueled nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism. When police came through the door using a battering ram, Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired once. He acknowledges that he may not have heard police identify themselves because of where he was in the apartment. If he’d heard them, “it changes the whole situation because there’s nothing for us to be scared of.”</p>
<p>The fear and confusion that played out after midnight inside and outside Ms. Taylor’s Louisville home was detailed in 15 hours of audio recordings made public in a rare release. While the recordings added rich detail about what happened as police fired 32 shots in the last moments of Ms. Taylor’s life, nothing on them appeared to change the fundamental narrative that was previously made public.</p>
<p>The recordings also do not include any discussion of potential criminal action on the part of the officers who shot Ms. Taylor because Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron determined beforehand that they had acted in self-defense. As a result, he did not seek charges against police in her killing — a recommendation the grand jury followed.</p>
<p>The material released does not include juror deliberations or prosecutor recommendations and statements, none of which were recorded, according to Mr. Cameron’s office.</p>
<p>The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said it will release its own assessment of how the evidence was presented after a review of the recordings.</p>
<p>On the March night in question, police arrived at Ms. Taylor’s apartment with a narcotics warrant to search the home. She and her boyfriend were in bed. Within minutes, she had been shot five times.</p>
<p>Though police had a “no-knock” warrant that would have allowed them to burst in unannounced, they agreed it was better to “give them a chance to answer the door,” said Louisville police Lt. Shawn Hoover. Detective Myles Cosgrove said the officers had been told to “use our maturity as investigators to get into this house.”</p>
<p>In a police interview played for the grand jury, Lt. Hoover said the officers announced themselves as police and knocked three times. He estimated they waited 45 seconds to a minute before going through the door.</p>
<p>Mr. Walker said he heard knocking, but that police did not respond to his and Ms. Taylor’s repeated requests that whoever was at the door identify themselves.</p>
<p>“She’s yelling at the top of her lungs, and I am too at this point. No answer. No response. No nothing,” said Mr. Walker.</p>
<p>Detective Michael Nobles said officers made so much noise battering in the door that an upstairs neighbor came outside.</p>
<p>Mr. Walker fired once, hitting Detective Jonathan Mattingly in the leg. Detective Mattingly said in testimony that he fired his gun while falling on his backside.</p>
<p>Detective Cosgrove said he thought he fired four or fewer shots, but the evidence showed he fired 16 rounds, including the bullet that killed Ms. Taylor.</p>
<p>Officer Brett Hankison, who has since been fired, told investigators that he saw flashes inside the apartment and feared his fellow officers were “sitting ducks.” Mr. Hankison said he began shooting, and when gunfire inside the apartment continued, moved to fire through a window. He fired 10 bullets.</p>
<p>Mr. Hankison was the only officer indicted by the grand jury, which charged him with wanton endangerment for shooting into another home with people inside. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>“What I saw at the time was a figure in a shooting stance,” said Mr. Hankison.</p>
