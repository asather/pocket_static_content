<h1>Carnegie man pleads guilty to murder and rape in 2019 attack</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Carnegie man will spend the rest of his life in prison after pleading guilty Tuesday to strangling one man and raping a woman in Scott last year.</p>
<p>In exchange for the plea from Richard A. Mickens Jr., the Allegheny County District Attorney’s office withdrew its intention to seek the death penalty.</p>
<p>Mickens, 59, pleaded guilty before Common Pleas Judge Anthony M. Mariani to first-degree murder for the death of Luke Connolly, rape and aggravated assault.</p>
<p>Judge Mariani sentenced him to serve a prison term of life without parole, plus 11 to 22 years.</p>
<p>Defense attorney Lisa Middleman told the judge that her client had a lengthy drug and mental health history.</p>
<p>“That is offered not as an excuse,” she said, “But rather as an explanation as to how we got here.”</p>
<p>When given the opportunity to speak, Mickens said nothing.</p>
<p>According to Allegheny County police, Mickens strangled Mr. Connolly on May 11, 2019, at Mr. Connolly’s apartment on Third Avenue in Carnegie.</p>
<p>The then-31-year-old woman who was attacked told police she arrived at the apartment about 10 or 11 p.m. and saw Mr. Connolly lying on the kitchen floor having trouble breathing. She said Mickens then attacked her — beating and stabbing her in the back, before raping her.</p>
<p>The woman also told police that she heard Mr. Connolly making noises on the floor, and Mickens wrapped a garbage bag around his head and stabbed him in the chest with a screwdriver.</p>
<p>After the rape, Mickens made the woman shower and held her for several hours, threatening to kill her, too. She was able to escape to a neighbor’s home after he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Mickens was arrested at a home in Scott three days later. A woman there told police he’d been invited there by her roommate, and that Mickens entered her bedroom, held a knife to her throat and threatened to rape and kill her.</p>
<p>Officers surrounded the house that morning and arrested him when he walked out the back door</p>
<p>In victim impact statements read to the court by Assistant District Attorney Alex Cashman, Mr. Connolly’s family told the judge that their brother had only moved into the efficiency apartment six months earlier and loved it there.</p>
<p>The family watched the proceedings via video screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Connolly was one of eight kids and was still referred to by his siblings as “the baby,” said sister, Barb Connolly Collins.</p>
<p>Another sister, Kathleen Handerhan, told the court that she used to drop meals off to her brother regularly because her office was near his new apartment.</p>
<p>She was the last in her family to see him, she wrote, the morning of May 11 as she went to the post office. As Ms. Handerhan drove down the road, she saw Mr. Connolly in front of the coffee shop nearby. She stopped, and he hopped in her car. They drove together for about 300 feet, listened to classical guitar music she was playing and talked for a few minutes.</p>
<p>He then hopped out to go back to the coffee shop.</p>
<p>“He was happy and smiling as he waved goodbye,” she said.  The next day, Ms. Handerhan wrote, she received the call that Mr. Connolly had been killed.</p>
<p>“Luke’s murder was a heinous crime,” wrote Ms. Handerhan. “Absolutely no mercy was shown toward my brother over a period of five to six hours. Absolutely no mercy should be reflected in the sentencing of Richard Mickens.”</p>
<p>Another sister, Mary Connolly, told the court that simply seeing a knife or plastic bag reminds her of how her brother suffered.</p>
<p>“When I think of what happened to him, it’s hard to breathe, and it’s hard to think of the suffering he went through,” Mary Connolly wrote.</p>
<p>Ms. Connolly Collins said her brother’s death was devastating to their family and something they cannot understand.</p>
<p>“I don’t ever want to understand,” she wrote. “Nobody deserves this cruelty. We have all gone over this scenario hoping for an understanding that we know will never come.”</p>
