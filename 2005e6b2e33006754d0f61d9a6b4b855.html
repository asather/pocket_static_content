<h1>No offseason workouts allowed for high school sports teams until July 1</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Usually by this time of the year, many high school football teams are lifting weights on a regular basis and are having some team workouts, sometimes on a field. But any coach hoping to get his team together for an offseason workout will have to wait until at least July 1 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The WPIAL had its annual April meeting with athletic directors Wednesday. It’s sort of a state-of-the-union thing that had to be held on video this year, with WPIAL associate executive director Amy Scheuneman addressing the ADs about a number of subjects.</p>
<p>Spring sports have already been canceled in Pennsylvania and it’s questionable when high school sports teams might be permitted to start working out or practicing. But Scheuneman informed the ADs that, according to the PIAA, no teams could practice until the official end of the school year June 30. According to PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi, that means no teams — including those in fall and winter sports — can have workouts or informal practices before July 1.</p>
<p>So, there will be no team weightlifting, 7-on-7 scrimmages in football, open gyms in basketball or any workouts for at least two-and-a-half months.</p>
<p>“No workouts or activities on a school campus before July 1,” Lombardi said. “If that changes, we will get it out to the membership as soon as possible.”</p>
<p><strong>Scholar-athlete winners</strong></p>
<p>Every year, the WPIAL names 20 seniors as winners of the WPIAL Scholar-Athlete Award, and each athlete gets a $1,000 college scholarship.</p>
<p>The WPIAL released the winners Wednesday and the list includes record-setting West Greene football running back Ben Jackson and Gateway’s Olivia Livingston, one of the most successful swimmers in WPIAL history. Jackson set a WPIAL single-season rushing record last season while Livingston became only the second swimmer in league history to finish a career with eight individual gold-medal winners.</p>
<p>The other nine boys Scholar-Athlete winners are Blackhawk’s Jack Aulbach, Greensburg Central Catholic’s Patrick Brewer, Thomas Jefferson’s Mac Duda, Penn-Trafford’s Gabe Dunlap, North Catholic’s Ryan Feczko, Mt. Lebanon’s Edward Kubit, Norwin’s Kurtis Phipps, Fox Chapel’s Shane Susnak and Seneca Valley’s Drew Vlasnik.</p>
<p>The other nine female winners are Thomas Jefferson’s Abigail Chalovich, Riverview’s Gillian Gaynor, Our Lady of the Sacred Heart’s Haley Hamilton, Latrobe’s Rachel Harter, Sewickley Academy’s Zofia Luther, South Fayette’s Hailey Poe, Freeport’s Sidney Shemanski, Carmichaels’ Kylie Sinn and Quaker Valley’s Annie Wicker.</p>
