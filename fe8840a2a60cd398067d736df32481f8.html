<h1>Penguins on pause: Jason Zucker fills a top-six need now and into the future</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>Long before Jake Guentzel crashed into the boards and created a massive void in the top-six, the Penguins had their eye on Jason Zucker.</p>
<p>For about three years, general manager Jim Rutherford coveted the skilled, slick-skating forward. He even had a deal in place with the Minnesota Wild to bring Zucker to Pittsburgh during the 2019 offseason. However, when Phil Kessel used his partial no-trade clause, the deal fell through.</p>
<p>On Feb. 10, the Penguins found a way to make the deal work after all.&nbsp;In Rutherford’s most-significant trade of the season, the Penguins acquired Zucker from the Wild in exchange for their best defensive prospect (Calen Addison), a conditional 2020 first-round pick and struggling forward Alex Galchenyuk.</p>
<p>The trade can be explained in two ways. It’s a win-now move for a team that’s always looking to maximize the Sidney Crosby-Evgeni Malkin window. It should also help the Penguins win by playing their specific brand of hockey, a game predicated on speed and skill.</p>
<p>Zucker stepped right into Guentzel’s spot in the top line, skating on Crosby’s left wing. He also earned some time on the top power-play unit. In 15 games, the 28-year-old tallied six goals and six assists, bringing his season total to 20 goals and 21 assists. It marks the fifth 20-goal campaign in his last six seasons, including a 33-goal performance during the 2017-18 season.</p>
<p>When asked to compare the Penguins system to the Wild system, Zucker said the differences are “black and white.” However, in the long run, when Zucker becomes accustomed to the way the Penguins want to play, the speed game and the latitude the Penguins afford their skill players should, in theory, help him play to his strengths and elevate his game as time goes on.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> It took Zucker two games to show Penguins fans what Rutherford saw in him. During a Feb. 11 win over Montreal, Zucker tallied two goals, his first two points in a Penguins sweater.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> Zucker averaged 0.8 points per game during his 15 games in Pittsburgh, the best per-game stats of his nine -year career. The next closest was when he averaged 0.78 points per game during his 33-goal season in 2017-18.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> The Penguins will have some decisions to make in their top-six. All indications from Rutherford and coach Mike Sullivan are that if the season returns, Guentzel’s season might eventually resume along with it. If Guentzel steps back into his normal spot on Crosby’s left wing, Zucker could slide down to play next to Malkin. Or maybe Zucker jumps to the right wing on the top line? Either way, the Penguins will have options.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> One of the things that excited Rutherford about this trade is that Zucker remains on contract through 2022-23 on a deal that carries a $5.5 million average annual value. So while, yes, this is a “win-now” move. The definition of “now” extends well beyond this year’s Stanley Cup playoffs. In a sense, Zucker has become another piece of the Penguins’ core.</p>
