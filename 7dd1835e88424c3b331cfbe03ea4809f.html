<h1>When will Mitch Keller take that next step?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — The big event of Mitch Keller’s offseason involved his own wedding, answering the most important question of his life to this point by saying “I do” to his high school sweetheart, Clancy.</p>
<p>This baseball season for Keller will be about answering another key question: Will the Pirates’ top pitching prospect be able to take that proverbial next step and successfully complete his development?</p>
<p>That, Keller knows, will lead to good things for both him and the Pirates. It’ll also stop the questions about what must happen for the 23-year-old Iowa native to avoid becoming Tyler Glasnow 2.0.</p>
<p>“If I can do it, then I won’t have to answer those questions anymore,” Keller said. “It’s on me.”</p>
<p>The Pirates need Keller to answer this question because they need all the pitching help they can get a year after producing a team ERA of 5.18, the fifth-worst in baseball.</p>
<p>And while most probably assume Keller will get a spot in the starting rotation, that’s hardly how he’s thinking about things right now.</p>
<p>For Keller, his primary goal of spring training is breaking camp with the big club. Then it’s about pitching with more conviction and locating his stuff.</p>
<p>“I feel really good,” Keller said. “Obviously I just want to have a really good spring, do what I’m capable of, break with the team and have a rotation spot.”</p>
<p>The key to Keller doing that has multiple layers, the same as for most pitchers his age.</p>
<p>Last season for Keller offered plenty of experience, some of it good, other parts bad. The end results were kind of ugly — a 1-5 record, 7.13 ERA and 1.833 WHIP — but Keller also enjoyed plenty of bright spots.</p>
<p>His best start of the season likely came Aug. 23, 2019, at PNC Park against the Reds, when Keller went a season-high six innings, allowed one earned run, struck out nine and walked one. He got ahead of hitters early by delivering first-pitch strikes to 20 of the 24 batters he faced and went to a three-ball count just once.</p>
<p>Keller’s fastball had life. He buried his breaking stuff and induced a couple of ugly swings. Only Cincinnati right fielder Aristides Aquino, who was red hot at the time, did any sort of damage against Keller, when he whacked an elevated slider out of the park.</p>
<p>“Everything,” Keller said that night, “was working.”</p>
<p>But not all nights were that pretty, as Keller was caught nibbling too many times for someone with such deadly stuff.</p>
<p>Naturally shy and soft-spoken, Keller didn't always pitch like he belonged. In the clubhouse, he was guilty of keeping to himself, fearful of stepping on toes. Other pitchers on Pittsburgh’s staff prodded Keller, urging him to relax, but that sort of thing doesn’t just magically happen.</p>
<p>This spring, however, Keller has come out of his shell a little more.</p>
<p>“I feel way better this year coming into big-league camp since last year was my first one,” Keller said. “I’m more comfortable with my surroundings, the guys and being able to be who I am, not trying to be anybody else. I feel like I belong now.”</p>
<p>The addition of pitching coach Oscar Marin should also help Keller grow. Marin has a background in biomechanics and wants the Pirates to take more of an analytical approach to their pitching program.</p>
<p>Employing a modern attack plan should benefit someone like Keller, who saw the most success when relying on spin; his slider had a 47.8% whiff rate, per Statcast, while his curveball was at 34.0%.</p>
<p>Although Pittsburgh’s former management team harped on Keller’s change-up, it seems the new one is more interested in accentuating what Pirates pitchers do well and adjusting their approach to that.</p>
<p>“It’s been really good getting to know Oscar,” Keller said. “I’ve been learning a bunch. I’ve talked to him probably two or three times out on the field already. I’ve learned some stuff. I’m just trying to refine my pitches a little bit and get really good at those.”</p>
<p>Even though the numbers weren’t much to write home about, Keller was encouraged by what he did last season, including his rate of 12.2 strikeouts per nine innings.</p>
<p>But for Keller to earn a spot this year — and to finally answer that key question — he knows he needs to pitch with confidence and also trust his stuff.</p>
<p>“We’ve talked a lot about [taking that next step],” Keller said. “I’m really excited to get going here, see what we can tap into and get a lot better at that.”</p>
