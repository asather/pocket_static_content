<h1>Steve Blass: Death of Kobe Bryant feels similar to that of Roberto Clemente</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — They were transcendent stars in their respective sports lost way too young, one by cargo plane the other (and most recent) via helicopter crash.</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant and Roberto Clemente probably weren’t bound by much before Bryant’s helicopter crashed into a steep hillside in Calabasas, about 30 miles northwest Los Angeles, killing the former NBA star, his 13-year-old daughter and seven others aboard.</p>
<p>Steve Blass remembers all too well the details of Dec. 31, 1972, when Clemente died at age 38 while attempting to deliver aid and help earthquake victims in Nicaragua. Blass and his wife, Karen, had hosted a New Year's Eve party. And while a couple of good friends from down the street — Dave and Ginny Giusti — stayed over, Blass received a phone call at 4 a.m. It was former Pirates public relations director Bill Guilfoyle, telling Blass there was an unconfirmed report that a plane crashed in Puerto Rico, and Clemente was on it.</p>
<p>“Of course there was no sleeping after that,” Blass said.</p>
<p>Next came a trip to general manager Joe L. Brown’s house, where they tried to learn more. “But back then there wasn’t CC or 24-hour news,” Blass said. Eventually everybody congregated at Willie Stargell’s place “because we didn’t know what else to do.”</p>
<p>Blass, who eulogized Clemente at his memorial service, has been thinking about that chain of events and the layers involved after watching the same sort of thing happen to Bryant, the Lakers legend and another professional athlete lost way too young.</p>
<p>“The age, at 41, is too young for anyone, but for an iconic figure it's unbelievable,” Blass said during a break from Pirates Fantasy Camp. “Then his daughter is involved. There are so many layers to that tragedy with Kobe Bryant. It does bring a sliver of thought back to Clemente’s abrupt death in that New Year’s plane crash.”</p>
<p>The toughest thing, Blass said, was how the reminders didn’t stop. There was the death itself, then the memorial service. Spring training rolled around, and the Pirates were obviously without their beloved right fielder, the same for Opening Day.</p>
<p>Even now, Blass said hardly a day goes by where he’s not asked something about Clemente, which is probably what the Lakers and others in that community will now experience.</p>
<p>“There are very few days that I don’t think of him because I get reminded of it by everybody I see,” Blass said. “The legacy of Clemente … I wouldn’t be surprised if it lasts like this for Kobe Bryant.</p>
<p>“It’s been 40-some years for Clemente, and there’s still a documentary done every year or a book written or a street or park named. It’s unique in sports to think after 40-some years that Clemente has lasted this long, and it’s because of the nature of the death.”</p>
<p>Blass also made sure to point out that tragedies like this happen every day. It’s only because Clemente and Bryant were famous that they receive the amount of attention they do. But they hit everyone really hard.</p>
<p>“We’re not unique,” Blass said. “We’re in sports. It happens to everybody. The people we don’t hear about it, it happens to people every day that don’t get headlines, but it’s just as tragic.”</p>
<p>Bryant appeared well on his way to a terrific post-playing life, pursuing interests outside of basketball and supporting his daughter, Gianna. Clemente obviously had myriad interests outside of baseball, especially giving those in Puerto Rico a chance to play the sport he loved and helping those in need.</p>
<p>Another question Blass said he’s often asked about Clemente involves how much longer he would have played, if the crash had never happened. While Clemente looked to be in tremendous shape, Blass said it wasn’t that simple. Clemente was ailing and even contemplated retirement before the crash happened.</p>
<p>“He had a great body, but it wasn’t a really healthy body,” Blass said. “He looked better than he was physically.</p>
<p>“Also, his standards were so high. If he wasn’t playing up to his standards, he would have stopped immediately. There are times when he thought about stopping before that. The body wasn’t like it appeared on the outside.</p>
<p>“At 38, it looked like he had the body of 25-year-old player. That was a perception thing. When he was the World Series MVP, you saw him with his shirt off, he was ripped on the outside. But he had malaria. He got t-boned in a car wreck. He had arthritic issues with his neck and spine.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the ailments didn’t allow for anyone to prepare. The loss was sudden and abrupt and massive because of the profile of player we’re talking about.</p>
<p>“Those kinds of things, at 41, in a second the life is gone,” Blass said. “You’re in shock. I never even knew Kobe Bryant, but at 41 years old, he’s got a second life in front of him. And it looked like he got it, about what to do with it.”</p>
