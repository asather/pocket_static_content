<p>The weather is a bit brighter for Jeff Verszyla.</p>
<p>The former KDKA-TV chief meteorologist will begin working freelance for WTAE-TV newscasts, beginning this weekend. He is expected to work mostly weekend evenings into early August on an “as needed” basis.</p>
<p>He starts on Father’s Day at 6:30 and 11 p.m.</p>
<p>“I am thankful and excited for the opportunity to return to local television doing the job that I love for the city I love,” said Verszyla, whose contract noncompete clause ended in January.</p>
<p>He had been let go by KDKA in December 2018 after 23 years. Neither he nor the station would comment on the reason.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Verszyla has cultivated a following for his homespun “<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2019/09/03/Jeff-Verszyla-former-KDKA-meteorologist-WhiteBoard-Weather-Facebook-Live/stories/201909020114" target="_blank">Whiteboard Weather</a>” online <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JeffVerszylaWeather" target="_blank">Facebook segments</a>, often assembled in his backyard in Pine.</p>
<p>He said he will continue doing them weekdays at 7:30 a.m. and 3 p.m.</p>
<p>In his Facebook Live announcement Thursday evening, Verszyla joked that perhaps he’d be&nbsp;“rusty,” given it’s been about 18 months since he was last on air.</p>
<p>WTAE has an opening on its weather team with the departure of Alex Alecci, who just took a job at NBC affiliate WESH in Orlando, Fla.</p>
