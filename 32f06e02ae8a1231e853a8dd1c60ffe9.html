<h1>IPSCO Tubulars to lay off hundreds of workers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>IPSCO Koppel Tubulars LLC in Beaver County plans to lay off more than 500 workers this month amid struggles in the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>The company will lay off 210 people at its seamless tube plant in Ambridge and 350 at its steel shop 20 miles north in Koppel, effective March 31, according to a Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) filed with the state Department of Labor and Industry.</p>
<p>The company didn’t immediately return a call requesting comment.</p>
<p>In January, IPSCO was sold by its parent company — Russian steel giant TMK — to Luxembourg-based Tenaris, a global maker and supplier of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry.</p>
