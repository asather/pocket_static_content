<h1>Crosby watch continues as Penguins captain was still not ready to return in Arizona</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>GLENDALE, ARIZ. – A week-long road trip for the Penguins wrapped up Sunday without injured captain Sidney Crosby making his return to the lineup.</p>
<p>After Crosby took another stride in his recovery Saturday by practicing in a team setting without contact restrictions, there appeared to be a chance he might play Sunday against the Arizona Coyotes at Gila River Arena. Neither coach Mike Sullivan nor Crosby ruled out the possibility after Saturday’s skate.</p>
<p>But ultimately Crosby and the team concluded that he’s not quite ready.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to get into how the decision was made,” Sullivan said Sunday. “We’re going to watch Sid. He’s going to go through the rehab process. Part of it is practicing with the team. Part of it isn’t. And then we’re going to try to make decisions … in the best interest of Sid and the team. So that’s what we did.”</p>
<p>Even though Crosby ended up not playing in any of the three games during this trip out west, that he came along on the trip was a positive thing.</p>
<p>He enjoyed experiencing again the camaraderie with teammates after missing the past two months following sports hernia surgery. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/11/20/penguins-injured-reserve-nick-bjugstad-zach-aston-reese/stories/201911200150" target="_blank">Life on injured reserve can make a player feel pretty isolated</a>. From a rehab standpoint, he had three productive on-ice workouts, though he wished he was able to get in one more.</p>
<p>Crosby skated in an individual setting Tuesday and Wednesday in Las Vegas. He had a scheduled day off Thursday while the Penguins held a team practice in Denver. Friday, Crosby felt ill and didn’t skate for a second straight day.</p>
<p>Back on the ice Saturday, his first full-team practice since Jan. 3, he wore a regular jersey, signifying that he is cleared for contact. He took part in line rushes for the first time since his surgery. He also participated in power-play drills.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to get as much contact as I can. It’s pretty difficult with the practices,” Crosby said Saturday. “It’s too bad I missed that one the other day. It’s just the way it goes. So, yeah, I’m trying to get a little bit of that in when I can.”</p>
<p>The Penguins will not practice Monday. Tuesday, they host the Minnesota Wild at PPG Paints Arena. Sullivan will likely hold a morning skate that day, giving them another chance to gauge Crosby’s progress. They practice in Cranberry a day later. They then have back-to-back road games in Boston and Detroit.</p>
<p>Crosby is hopeful he will return to the lineup sometime during the week.</p>
<p>“Our schedule – we’re playing so many games – it’s not ideal for trying to get back into the lineup,” he said. “Getting practices in and the guys who are playing, I think their focus is to get out there, skate and get off and use the rest while you can. So I’m just trying to make the most of the practices with the group.”</p>
<p><strong>Who will skate with Sid?</strong></p>
<p>During line rushes in Saturday’s practice, Jared McCann and Patric Hornqvist were on Crosby’s wings. McCann, who has been playing center in Crosby’s absence, is an intriguing option as the Penguins look to replace Jake Guentzel.</p>
<p>“He’s got a great shot. I didn’t realize playing against him, then seeing it every day,” Crosby said of McCann. “He shoots the puck a lot and with a shot like that he should. I think his speed opens up a lot. But then he’s able to finish.”</p>
<p>Late last season, McCann skated on the top line with Crosby and Guentzel for several games. Their best one came March 2 in Montreal, when both Crosby and Guentzel had four-point nights. McCann scored and was a plus-4.</p>
<p>“It was just easy,” McCann said Saturday. “[Crosby] was always in the right spots defensively and we turned that into offense. Obviously, we had a great night in Montreal. ... If I get the opportunity to play with him, it will be nice.”</p>
<p>Sunday, McCann centered a line between Dominik Simon and Hornqvist.</p>
<p><strong>Pettersson, Marino click</strong></p>
<p>Injuries to Brian Dumoulin and Justin Schultz have led to the Penguins getting a look at two promising young blue-liners playing together. Marcus Pettersson and John Marino have been logging significant minutes as their second pair.</p>
<p>“They’re just a safe, reliable pair,” Sullivan said. “I think their game has really grown offensively, both of them. They make good outlet passes. They’re active off that offensive blue line. So we like their solid two-way game. They’re hard to play against by nature of their size and their reach and their mobility.”</p>
<p>The coach added: “They’ve been pretty good since they’ve been together.”</p>
<p>Marino continues to play at a high level. Entering Sunday, he had four points in the previous three games. And he’s averaged more than 22 minutes of ice time over the previous six games. That’s noteworthy considering he has already played more games this season than he did at Harvard last season.</p>
<p>“He’s been terrific. He’s been one of our better defensemen,” Sullivan said. “He’s been playing in a top-four capacity for some time and he’s met the challenge. He’s a guy that can handle minutes, too. He doesn’t seem to get fatigued.”</p>
