<h1>Late billionaire Scaife's son, grandson propose $200M settlement of trust fund battle</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two of late billionaire publisher Richard Mellon Scaife’s heirs have proposed a $200 million settlement to resolve a long-running, high-stakes court battle over a drained trust fund.</p>
<p>But the suggested settlement represents less than half the amount at issue in more than five years of running litigation over whether the fund was improperly drained of roughly $450 million.</p>
<p>And the suggested settlement — pitched by Mr. Scaife’s son, grandson and two of the fund’s three trustees — leaves out one key player: the estate of his late daughter.</p>
<p>“We were not a part of this process, and we might have a lot to say, but I need to evaluate all this and engage with my client,” lawyer William Pietragallo II, who represents the estate of Jennie Scaife, said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ms. Scaife died childless in 2018.&nbsp;David Zywiec, the executor of Ms. Scaife's estate, is president of the Scaife Family Foundation in West Palm Beach, Fla. The foundation is the principal beneficiary of her estate.</p>
<p>The petition was filed Tuesday in Allegheny County’s Orphans’ Court division.</p>
<p>Mr. Scaife, who owned the Tribune-Review media properties, died in 2014. His children — David N. Scaife and Jennie Scaife —&nbsp;were supposed to get whatever was left in a trust fund bequeathed by his mother.</p>
<p>But the children found that the principal in the once-gargantuan nest egg, referred to as the 1935 Trust, was gone.</p>
<p>The children claimed that the fund’s trustees — PNC Bank, James M. Walton and H. Yale Gutnick —&nbsp;had improperly handled the money. They accused the trustees of emptying the fund of $450 million in principal over a 20-year period in order to allow Mr. Scaife to prop up the Tribune-Review.</p>
<p>The son and daughter sought to show that the trustees wasted the fund’s assets, at least in part because Mr. Scaife wanted to “disinherit his children,” as a state Superior Court judge put it in a recent decision.</p>
<p>E.J. Strassburger, who represents Mr. Gutnick, declined comment, as did Thomas Frampton, Mr. Walton's lawyer. Other attorneys involved in the case could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>In the petition, David N. Scaife, his son, David G. Scaife, Mr. Walton and PNC Bank have come together to ask the court to endorse their suggested settlement plan.</p>
<p>The petitioners signed off on the settlement agreement on Dec. 30, and Mr. Gutnick earlier this month agreed to be bound by certain parts of it.</p>
<p>Now a judge has to approve it.</p>
<p>Of the $200 million, which would come from Mr. Scaife’s estate, $24.3 million would be earmarked for his son and his daughter’s estate, the petition says.</p>
<p>That amount represents income that would have been generated between July 2014, when Mr. Scaife died, and November 2018, when his daughter died, had the fund still had $200 million in principal.</p>
<p>The rest, according to the settlement terms, would be returned to the 1935 Trust.</p>
<p>While Mr. Gutnick is not part of the joint petition, it says that he does not object to the settlement.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for PNC Bank, Mr. Walton and Mr. Gutnick to resign as trustees and be replaced by trustees suggested by Mr. Scaife’s son and grandson.</p>
