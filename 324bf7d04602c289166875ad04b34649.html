<h1>#H2P is trending as Panthers win in the lab</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Hail to Pitt” is a term you’ll usually hear students and alumni of the University of Pittsburgh casually belting and chanting during an athletic event or school celebration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But on Thursday, the three words became more&nbsp;than just a weapon towards rival universities when bragging about Pitt’s achievements on the field. The phrase that was deemed the title of the school’s fight song in the early 1900’s was used as a message to the world that help may soon be on its way.</p>
<p>#Hail2Pitt,”&nbsp;“HailtoPitt,” and #H2P” were trending on social media after the university announced it was making progress <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/04/02/Pitt-team-makes-progress-on-possible-COVID-19-vaccine/stories/202004020135" target="_blank">towards a potential COVID-19 vaccine</a>, just over a month after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/02/27/Pitt-lab-working-to-create-vaccine-for-COVID-19-coronavirus-pittsburgh/stories/202002270194" target="_blank">the school received samples </a>of the novel coronavirus for testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an online press conference at Pitt Thursday morning, researches said they are very early in the process, but hope their work will lead to a working vaccine which they have dubbed PittCoVacc.</p>
<p>The news sparked tweets and messages based in relief and rejoicing during a time of stress from alumni like Rob Strauss, who tweeted&nbsp;“Now we go!! #H2P,” after Pitt’s April 2 announcement.</p>
<p>Mr. Strauss earned a master’s degree in Higher Administration and Education from Pitt and currently works as the Director of Business Administration in the university’s School of Business. He said energy of hope and excitement flooded Pitt’s staff when the lab began working on a vaccine back in February.</p>
<p>Mr. Strauss told the Post-Gazette Friday that the excitement was not just about the idea of helping the city of Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The big thing with Pitt is the number one thing in our strategic plan is always to engage in research of impact,” he said. “We need to make sure that whatever we are doing has a global reach and it’s going to help not just our communities, but the communities around the world.”</p>
<p>Andrea Gambotto, an associate professor of surgery at Pitt, teamed up with another Pitt researcher, Louis Falo, professor and chairman of the department of dermatology at Pitt’s School of Medicine and UPMC, to work together on developing an innovative way to administer the potential vaccine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Falo had already been developing what he calls a “microneedle array,” a finger-tip sized patch of 400 tiny needles that can be applied directly to the skin to deliver the vaccine into the body. Mr. Strauss said this methodology only speaks to Pitt’s desire for the vaccine to help people worldwide.</p>
<p>“They had to think outside the box to figure out how we could have that global reach in a short amount of time, so it does give you a real good since of pride to know that we are cutting edge and didn’t just think of the standard vaccine,” Mr. Strauss said. “We went above and beyond to think how can this impact more than just the Pittsburgh region or the United States.”</p>
<p>For 2018 graduate Matt Whalen, the news of a potential vaccine reminded him of when the University of Pittsburgh developed the vaccine for the polio virus in the 1950’s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Glenshaw native said he has pride in knowing that this potential accomplishment during one of the most infectious pandemics of our lifetime could push Pitt into the national spotlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There was the polio vaccine, but that happened such a long time ago that there’s probably a lot of people who underestimate how important it was at the time,” Mr. Whalen said. “And now with the use of social media… if this vaccine works out, Pitt would likely be the most famous university in the world for a period of time.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Whalen works as an IT recruiter and has seen first hand how the coronavirus has disrupted the lives of millions, especially those who have lost their jobs. He hopes the news from Pitt researchers might provide a glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Even if the whole vaccination is [approved] a year from now or is a long term project, I think that there’s a lot of people out there who need something to look forward to and any good news is great news,” he said.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;“Hail to Pitt” competitive mentality was not lost on 2006 graduate David Goldstein who said he immediately sent the news to his&nbsp;friends who went to Penn State and West Virginia University and “bragged with pride.”</p>
<p>While 2018 graduate Nathan Reese said his pride stems from&nbsp;“seeing Pitt’s dedication and expertise to make a difference in the world,” the news also touched Pittsburgh residents like&nbsp;Jacob Balistreri who attended Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Balisteri has been battling bouts of anxiety since the pandemic began. His mom suffered a heart attack two years ago, and the doctors told her she was at high-risk if she were to contract COVID-19. The thought that there could be a potential vaccine to come out of his hometown gave the 2018 graduate a much needed sense of hope.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to have to relive what happened with my mom with her heart attack so it makes me like a germaphobe to take everything as seriously as possible and take every precaution,” Mr. Balisteri said. “It’s very relieving to know that there is a way to solve all of this with the coronavirus, and that there can be something that is going to work to benefit everybody.”</p>
