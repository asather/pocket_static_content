<h1>‘We may actually benefit from the rainfall’: NWS Pittsburgh predicts Hurricane Laura’s impact</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As Hurricane Laura, now labeled as a Category 4 hurricane, touches down on Texas-Louisiana Gulf Coast on Wednesday night, meteorologists are expecting the storm to head up north. Remnants of the storm may be beneficial for the Pittsburgh area, according to National Weather Service Pittsburgh meteorologist John Darnley.</p>
<p>The most the Pittsburgh area may see is heavy rain Sunday, according to Mr. Darnley.</p>
<p>“We can’t rule out the fact that there could be some — especially south of I-70 — some storms that can pop up,” he said.</p>
<p>But for the most part, Mr. Darnley said, an “extra tropical” storm usually produces a tropical environment, so southwestern Pennsylvania will likely see an increase of temperatures, humidity and “definitely” some increased rainfall. Mr. Darnley said the increase in rainfall would actually be beneficial amid the lack of rainfall the area has seen for the past three months.</p>
<p>“I think most farmers right now would welcome the tropical system because normally we don’t see the strong winds that you will see down in [the] Texas and Louisiana area,” Mr. Darnley said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of Wednesday night, NWS’s forecast is a 30% chance of rain for Saturday night going into Sunday and then mostly sunny for Sunday. Mr. Darnley said he doesn’t predict any flooding will occur from the remnants of the storm, due to the lack of rainfall in the area throughout the summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Darnley said the forecast predicts the storm will head north to Arkansas and will take “a sharp right” once it gets just up past Arkansas into Missouri. This sharp right is caused by winds from the north — as a tropical jet converges with the northern jet winds.</p>
<p>“[The hurricane] is holding together pretty good, normally when they come in through Texas, they normally don’t stay in for that long, they normally dissipate before they go in to Oklahoma and die out in Missouri at the latest, but this one stays together, it kind of converges with a northern cold front and moves right through,” Mr. Darnley said. Since the cold front is already south of Pittsburgh — in West Virginia — it will keep most of the remnants of the storm south, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Darnley said he sees one model predict that areas in Southern Ohio will see around 1¾ inches of rain in a 24-hour period and 1½ inches of rainfall in Morgantown, W.Va. He says the same model predicts there may not be rainfall at all in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
<p>“Really, it keeps it south,” Mr. Darnley said.&nbsp;</p>
