<p>Highmark Health and subsidiary Allegheny Health Network cut the ribbon Monday on a $78 million cancer center at Allegheny General Hospital.</p>
<p>The 90,000-square-foot cancer center at the North Side hospital is the centerpiece of Highmark’s big expansion of cancer treatment facilities in Western Pennsylvania over 18 months, which cost more than $300 million for new centers in Monroeville, Erie, Butler, Beaver and Westmoreland counties.</p>
<p>In addition, AHN has renovated and expanded treatment centers in Robinson Township and at West Penn Hospital in Bloomfield.</p>
<p>“We believe that our investment in AHN Cancer Institute’s capabilities and capacity will greatly improve the experience and outcomes of those who are diagnosed with this disease,” Highmark Health President and CEO David Holmberg said in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>About one in every two Pennsylvanians will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime, Mr. Holmberg said. And according to the American Cancer Society, about 1.8 million new cancer cases —&nbsp;including 80,000 in Pennsylvania alone —&nbsp;are expected to be diagnosed in 2020, a 2% increase from 2015.</p>
<p>Cancer researcher and surgeon David Bartlett was named chair of AHN’s Cancer Institute two months ago, succeeding radiation oncologist David Parda who oversaw the cancer network for nearly 20 years. Dr. Parda now serves as president of AGH.</p>
