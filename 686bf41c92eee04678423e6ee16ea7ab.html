<h1>Bastard Bearded Irishmen will stream some St. Patrick's Day energy tonight</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“I don’t want to say you feed off the audience,” says Bastard Bearded Irishmen drummer Dan Stocker, “but it does give you a boost.”</p>
<p>Whatever way the energy flows, there’s no doubt that the Pittsburgh Celtic punk band plays some of the rowdiest, most spirited shows in the city, especially this time of year.</p>
<p>Tonight, for St. Patrick’s Day, the Bastards will keep a safe “social distance” with a livestream concert from a friend’s studio. It launches The Pandemic Series from 25Carrick —&nbsp;performances serving as a fundraiser for local artists, with the hope of raising $25,000. It begins at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>BBI’s big annual bash was slated to be parade day last Saturday at the Rex Theater on the South Side. That show got caught up in the wave of cancellations to counter the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The band managed to play the South Side anyway, turning up to perform as a quartet on the back of a trailer bed riding down Carson Street, where the bars were packed despite the urging of officials to keep crowds small.</p>

<p>“We figured we would bring a little happiness or joy to people on the South Side,” Stocker says.</p>
<p>After all, those crowds were there anyway.</p>
<p>Tonight, on Christmas for Celtic bands, Bastard Bearded Irishmen was scheduled to play a private event in Seven Springs, which has been postponed to a later date.</p>
<p>Instead, they’ll play to just a handful of guests and try to reach as many people as possible in the virtual world.</p>
<p>“We try to play the same show,” Stocker says, “whether it’s for 20 people or 2,000 people. You can’t fake it when you’re playing music like this.”</p>
<p>Bastard Bearded Irishmen will have a little company online tonight. The Dropkick Murphys, the kings of Celtic punk, will do a no-crowd livestream from their hometown of Boston on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook.</p>
<p>It may not be the St. Patrick’s Day people planned, but with an Irish ale and the chance to flip back and forth between two of Celtic punks’ finest, we’ll have to make the best of it.</p>
