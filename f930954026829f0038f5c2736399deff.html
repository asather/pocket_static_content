<p>A&nbsp;giant in the field of constitutional law. The conscience of the court when it came to gender issues. Never can be replaced. She will go down in history as one of the great justices on the Supreme Court. A hero.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s how Duquesne University President Ken Gormley described Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Friday night. Justice Ginsburg, who had been battling cancer for over a decade, died Friday at age 87 due to complications from the cancer, the U.S. Supreme Court announced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>p&gt;Justice Ginsburg’s daughter, Jane C. Ginsburg, was a classmate of Mr. Gormley when he attended Harvard Law School, where they took a course together in First Amendment law.</p>
<p>“We were all really fond of Jane, and we were all really fond of her mom. She was a hero,” Mr. Gormley said. Mr. Gormley, who has taught constitutional law throughout his professional life, said Justice Ginsburg was a&nbsp;“giant” in the field of constitutional law, citing the landmark 1973 case&nbsp;Frontiero v. Richardson in which then-attorney Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued to the Supreme Court that equality for women was built into the 14th Amendment equal protection clause, stating a person’s sex bears no necessary relationship to ability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“She did for gender what [Supreme Court Justice] Thurgood Marshall did for race,” Mr. Gormley said. “She was the lawyer who established those rights for women at a crucial time in this country.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Gormley said he had the privilege of meeting Justice Ginsburg a few times throughout her life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“She was a teeny little woman,” Mr. Gormley said. “And didn’t have much emotion. But she had a wry sense of humor.”</p>
<p>Mr. Gormley recalls the time he first met her at a reception in the Supreme Court. He introduced himself by telling her he was a former classmate of her daughter and mentioned a fond memory he had, and the two laughed together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“She had a kind of really just deadpan delivery, sparkly sense of humor,” Mr. Gormley said.</p>
<p>When Judge Kim Berkeley Clark, now Allegheny County’s president judge, won the William H. Rehnquist Award for Judicial Excellence in her work as a judge, she reached out to Mr. Gormley and said her real dream was to meet Justice Ginsburg at the awards reception.</p>
<p>Mr. Gormley then wrote to Justice Ginsburg asking if she would be able to attend.</p>
<p>“She was at an advanced age and I wasn’t sure if she was going to be there for this reception,” Mr. Gormley said. “But she made it a point to be there long enough to take Ms. Clark into her chambers and meet with her and talk to her and take pictures with her. That was the kind of person she was.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“She wrote back to me saying she was, ‘too busy being the Notorious RBG,’” Mr. Gormley said, referring to the 2018 documentary film on Justice Ginsburg called “RBG,” and then chuckled. “I guess at that point she had been dragged into filming that ‘RBG’ movie and so she was kind of giving a little wry commentary on that.”</p>
<p>And then, Mr. Gormley said her conscience got the better of her. Sure enough, Mr. Gormley said, Justice Ginsburg sent in a short video she filmed for his program about how the First Amendment was the “bedrock of all of our freedoms under the Constitution.”</p>

<p>“It was her giving a really eloquent little presentation,” Mr. Gormley said. “I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she’s a Supreme Court justice, she’s become a national symbol, she’s working on this film, she’s in her 80s and she filmed this little film for me because I had gone to school with her daughter. She was just a special person.”</p>
<p>In terms of how Justice Ginsburg’s death will impact the Supreme Court in the future, Mr. Gormley isn’t sure.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to predict how her passing will impact the court, because, of course, there will be a political battle over replacing her before the election,” Mr. Gormley said. “It almost seems inappropriate to even think too much about that right now as we mourn her passing.</p>
<p>“But I will say that she is going to leave a giant void not just on the Supreme Court but in the country. She embodied all of the hopes and dreams of women not just in the legal profession but all professions.”</p>

<p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., also expressed his condolences on the death of Justice Ginsburg. “Justice Ginsburg served our Nation honorably and with distinction for four decades. Her heroic battles with cancer inspired countless Americans,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey added that he believes her seat should not be filled until the presidential election is over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Consistent with the precedent set by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2016, Justice Ginsburg’s seat should not be filled until the presidential election concludes and the candidate chosen by voters is sworn into office.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto also expressed his condolences on Twitter, stating, “what an incredible loss for our country and our world.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf also paid tribute to Justice Ginsburg on Twitter, stating that her</p>
<p></p>
<p>“A tireless defender of the Constitution, her historic opinions from the bench broke down barriers for women and protected the vulnerable,” Mr. Wolf wrote.&nbsp;</p>
