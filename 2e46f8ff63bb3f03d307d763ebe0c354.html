<h1>Rachael Carson Trail Challenge is postponed until next year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The 24th-annual Rachel Carson Trail Challenge, a 35-mile endurance hike from Harrison Hills Park to North Park, has been postponed due to COVID-19 restrictions on group events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hike had been scheduled for June 20, the longest day of the year, for 600 participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rachel Carson Trail Conservancy said in an announcement on its website,&nbsp;“We believe the government restriction on large gatherings will remain through the summer, but even if it's relaxed it would be too difficult to devise and maintain sanitary protocols on the buses, at the checkpoints, at the picnic, and along a crowded single-track trail.”</p>
<p>The group, which already canceled group training hikes, considered rescheduling the event for September, but decided there might not be enough daylight to complete <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/recreation/2016/05/07/Rachel-Carson-Trail-Challenge-marks-its-20th-year/stories/201603310259" target="_blank">the epic hike</a>. There also was going to be a&nbsp;“half challenge” and a 7-mile hike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registered hikers have been sent emails about how they can get refunds and also noting that they could choose to donate some of that money to support the trails. They’ll all earn&nbsp;“karma points” giving them priority for registering for next year’s event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trails, meanwhile, are open for hiking with proper social distancing. Learn more at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rachelcarsontrails.org" target="_blank">https://www.rachelcarsontrails.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>
