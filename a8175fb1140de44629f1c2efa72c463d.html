<h1>Ke'Bryan Hayes' father knows he's 'going to cry' for son's MLB debut</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ke’Bryan Hayes&nbsp;joined the Pirates in Bradenton, Fla., for spring training in February. In March, he was optioned to Class AAA Indianapolis, just days before MLB was shut down for the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In July, upon the season’s restart, he was chosen as a member of the Pirates’ summer camp roster in Pittsburgh. Then he caught COVID-19 himself, quarantined and spent the rest of that month and August at the Pirates’ alternate training site in Altoona.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of movement for the Pirates’ top prospect. But those highs and lows&nbsp;have all led to this week, when the 23-year-old is expected to be called up for his major league debut against the Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>His father, Charlie Hayes, a former Pirate and 13-year MLB veteran himself,&nbsp;says he spoke to his son more while he was in quarantine than he did all of last season, as the younger Hayes awaited his return and eventual call-up. Still, Charlie is thrilled for the opportunity his son is about to receive.&nbsp;The only regret now is that, because of COVID-19 restrictions, the family — Charlie, his wife, Gelinda, and Ke’Bryan’s brothers, Charlie Jr., and Tyree — won’t be able to see it in person.</p>
<p>“I would love to be there, man. It’s saddening that I can’t,” Charlie said Monday night from the family’s home in Tomball, Texas, just outside of Houston. “One of the things that we believe around the Hayes house is everything happens for a reason. I don’t know what possible reason can explain where we’re at right now that would make sense to me, because I can’t be there, but it is what it is, man. I’m so happy for him. … He accomplished something that he set out to do.</p>
<p>“... All we can do is support it. It’s killing us that we can’t be there, but that’s where we’re at. It’s kind of hard to talk about.”</p>
<p>Charlie Hayes isn’t one to hold back about his son. Once he starts answering questions, he quickly transitions into telling stories, his own major-league experiences, theories on parenting.</p>
<p>He remembers training with Ke’Bryan one day while he was in high school and receiving a phone call from Gelinda. As Charlie Hayes recalls, she asked if they were together, to which Ke’Bryan silently signaled no. Charlie said they were, though, unaware that Ke’Bryan’s homecoming was that day.</p>
<p>“She said, ‘Well, I guess he’s not going to be the homecoming king tonight,’ ” Charlie said. “That kind of sums it up with that kid.”</p>
<p>Charlie also remembers that Ke’Bryan may have been the least athletic of his three sons. When he was younger, first hitting home runs, Charlie remembers wondering why Ke’Bryan fell over running around the bases after poking balls over the wall.</p>
<p>Charlie says Ke’Bryan used to take 300-400 swings a day from the time he was 12 years old. From a similar age, Ke’Bryan took notice of the details. When the family went to watch a Houston Astros game together, Charlie recalls that an Astros player hit a bomb out of the stadium, and Ke’Bryan — around 13 at the time — commented on the speed of the batter’s hip turn.</p>
<p>“He’s a pretty strong-headed kid, man,” Charlie said. “Out of all my kids, and he’s the youngest one, I don’t think I have one gray hair on my head from him.</p>
<p>“… If I would have thought any one of my kids would have loved baseball more than me, I think it would be him, and we all love it dearly.”</p>
<p>More importantly, though, Charlie can speak with more perspective than most on what Ke’Bryan is about to accomplish. His own stories from his MLB days relay how difficult it is to make it to the majors at all. He believes fundamentals, hard work and a pure love of the game got him on right track, just as they can everyone else. He recognizes, however, that even with all of that, you need some good breaks.</p>
<p>As Ke’Bryan has gotten closer to his dream, Charlie has tried to stay away of coaching him too much. Sure, Charlie played for more than a decade in the majors, but he claims he was just “consistent. I wasn’t great.”</p>
<p>Charlie has also coached baseball since retiring. He relays stories of the people he’s met and learned from, such as Jim Leyland, Dusty Baker, Chili Davis and Willie Mays. But sometimes, he believes, “kids take [advice] better from everybody but their dads.”</p>
<p>The one hitting lesson Charlie remembers trying to instill is getting Ke’Bryan to hit the ball to the opposite field when he was younger, to which Charlie jokes that “it might have messed him up. I don’t know.” Plus, Charlie observed that Ke’Bryan knew what he was doing, learning to work out with a purpose, driven to get results.</p>
<p>So it’s been a balance for the two of them. When the season was shut down, Ke’Bryan came home and took swings with Charlie to stay prepared.</p>
<p>“He hit every day when we were here,” Charlie said. “I basically just throw. I don’t really say a whole lot.”</p>
<p>All of those stories in one conversation can seem a bit scattered. Including the lessons Charlie learned from his own playing days, they span decades.</p>
<p>But Ke’Bryan Hayes is about to become part of the tiny percentage of baseball players who make it to the majors. His status as a former first-round pick and one of the top 50 prospects in baseball means he’ll be afforded every opportunity to succeed. In other words, dreams are about to become real.</p>
<p>It’s the sort of thing that understandably yields parental nostalgia.&nbsp;Charlie is more proud than anything else, for a multitude of reasons. Put simply, though, his son has put in the work necessary to make it here, and now he’s being rewarded.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen the tears. I’ve seen the blood in the batting gloves. I’ve witnessed it all,” Charlie said. “... I know I’m going to cry [Tuesday], because like I said, this kid, he did all the right things.”</p>
