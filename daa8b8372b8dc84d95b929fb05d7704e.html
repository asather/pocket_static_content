<p>WASHINGTON — As the COVID-19 pandemic drags into the fall and winter months, the mass migration of in-person events and communication onto virtual platforms has exposed a widening gap between the connected and those left in the dark.</p>
<p>Now — as lawmakers negotiate another round of federal aid aimed at the longer-term effects of the health emergency — shortfalls in federal funding and telecom policy have failed so far to address the full scope of ongoing connectivity problems, lawmakers in both parties have argued.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are pressing for more funding for school districts, an expansion of subsidy programs for low-income households and permanent reimbursements for community telehealth expenses. All eyes are on Congress and the Federal Communications Commission&nbsp;to ensure everyone can remotely connect to remote platforms for learning, working and medical care.</p>
<p>“This is an emergency, the FCC has emergency powers, and they’re not using them,” said Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, in an interview last week.</p>
<p>While the FCC has doled out $200 million in grants for telehealth services,&nbsp;“they’ve basically been shrugging off this whole need to do anything on the education side,” Mr. Doyle said. “It’s very frustrating. And it’s not like we haven’t been pressing them. They just haven’t been responding.”</p>
<p>The FCC did not respond to requests for comment for this story.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle, a top member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee who chairs the congressional panel tasked with overseeing telecommunications, held a hearing in May with FCC chairman Ajit Pai to review the commission’s emergency actions during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Pai said there was&nbsp;“tremendous” demand for telehealth services and pledged to work with Congress to approve more funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, Mr. Doyle’s office has clashed with the FCC and Republicans in Congress over the need for funding for distance learning and low-income households.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>n letters and staff meetings with FCC officials, his office has pressed the commission to use its existing authority to take bolder action, including an expansion of the Lifeline program, which&nbsp;helps low-income Americans afford phone or internet service.</p>
<p>Lifeline recipients, he and other committee members wrote to Mr. Pai last month, should receive unlimited voice minutes and mobile data and an increase in the support to cover incremental costs for the duration of the pandemic.</p>
<p>In 2005, the lawmakers pointed out, the FCC boosted monthly subsidies to $130 after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, up from the typical&nbsp;$9.25 per month. It also altered the program’s rules to include mobile phones in addition to landlines.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle’s staff also has asked for the FCC to change requirements of the E-Rate program, which subsidizes telecom services for schools and libraries. Currently, funding for devices and services outside the classroom cannot be supported.</p>
<p>At the May hearing, Mr. Pai said he believed the FCC could not relax the E-Rate requirements without a change in law. Mr. Doyle said in the interview he disagreed, though his staff helped to negotiate language that the FCC requested in proposed legislation.</p>
<p>The debate over funding and policy changes for schools is one of many flashpoints as&nbsp;lawmakers and the White House grapple with another economic relief package.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CARES Act — the $2.3 trillion economic relief package approved by Congress in March —&nbsp;established programs that anticipated&nbsp;sharp yet short-term losses —followed by an economic rebound. The programs, for example, shored up temporary revenue shortfalls at hospitals and provided limited aid for small businesses and unemployed workers that expired this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March, Mr. Doyle’s office proposed $2 billion for distance learning in CARES Act talks with Senate Republicans and White House officials, who rejected the funding as unnecessary, according to a staffer familiar with the discussions. The FCC also denied a need for the funding, which would help to provide broadband hotspots and connected devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CARES Act wound up including $30 billion for education funding that would be doled out for a wide range of priorities for schools at all levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle said he’s witnessed real need for a carve-out for distance learning: Woodland Hills, the school district in his neighborhood, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/31/Woodland-Hills-seeks-funds-to-purchase-laptops-for-students-fundraiser-covid-19/stories/202003310149" target="_blank">held a fundraiser in the spring</a> to buy 700 laptops for students so it could continue to operate.</p>
<p>In May, the House Democrats’ emergency package included $4 billion for emergency rural broadband and another $1.5 billion for the E-Rate program. And, as part of House Democrats’ infrastructure bill passed in June, Mr. Doyle pushed a measure to spend an unprecedented $100 billion in rural broadband development.</p>
<p>Both of those bills, passed almost entirely along party lines, were shot down by the Republican-controlled Senate, which has proposed no money for broadband or distance learning.</p>
<p><strong>Direct funding</strong></p>
<p>Federal funding for recipients of broadband is a big part of the picture for providers, too.</p>
<p>Broadband coverage and reliability during the pandemic is a “great story” led by aggressive private investment in broadband over the last few years, especially by smaller companies, said Matt Polka, president and CEO of ACA Connects.</p>
<p>Mr. Polka — whose group is a Pittsburgh-based trade organization of roughly 800 small to medium-sized cable, phone and broadband providers — said his member companies have continued to work with schools to identify students who need broadband and created community hot spots in towns.</p>
<p>“There’s so much more that I think can be done with schools,” as well as telehealth, he said.</p>
<p>“Our preferred idea is: Let’s look at where the gaps are and then find practical ways to fill those gaps, primarily with subsidies — not to our members, but directly to those who need it: families, students, hospitals, medical facilities,” he said.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers have an eye toward making permanent some of the temporary benefits enacted during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Centre, introduced a measure in June to codify Medicare reimbursement for community health centers and rural health clinics to provide telehealth services.</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson, who spent nearly three decades as a therapist and licensed nursing home administrator before joining Congress in 2010, said he has seen how telehealth services improve life in rural and underserved communities. He has successfully pushed legislation over the years to expand telehealth services to members of the military and veterans.</p>
<p>“I’d like to believe the legislative success I’ve had kind of laid the foundation for this,” Mr. Thompson said. “The issue does come down to connectivity, obviously, but it comes to other issues, such as reimbursement.”</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Thompson, a&nbsp;member of the House Education and Labor Committee, did not see the same need for funding distance learning at schools, which he would prefer to reopen in person&nbsp;“not with a culture of fear but one of caution and courage.” Virtual learning is “very difficult,” especially for students with disabilities and those studying&nbsp;career tech fields.</p>
<p>He would support more funding for schools to pay for increased transportation, classroom modifications, additional staff to sanitize and spread students out, he said. And “they certainly may need additional devices, whatever those might be, although a lot of those investments were already put forward.”</p>
