<h1>Reports: Owners propose 76-game MLB season, prorated pay of 75%</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In what appears to be a never-ending back and forth between MLB and the players’ association, another proposal was made Monday morning for a possible avenue to return to baseball in 2020.</p>
<p>The proposal: A 76-game season with the players earning a 75% prorated salary. The season would begin around July 10, according to MLB Network’s Jon Heyman. It would run through Sept. 27, and the postseason would end in late October, ESPN’s Karl Ravech reported.</p>
<p>This comes on the heels of MLB saying that it was considering the possibility of simply starting a season of 50 games, paying the players a full prorated salary for those games. That seems like it would be the last-ditch, nuclear option for the owners, since it would mean the two sides couldn’t settle on a solution, so the owners simply had to force their hand.</p>
<p>This proposal does seem to be a concession from the owners on certain things. It is more games than the rumored 50. It is closer to a full prorated salary than plans MLB has proposed earlier, like the plan for a large, graduated pay cut for a longer season, which would have punished the game’s biggest stars more than others.</p>
<p>The proposal has apparently already been shot down, in a sense, by the MLBPA. It took less than 10 minutes for reports to surface that the union felt this offer was a step back because it isn’t fully prorated, and the players assume some financial risk based on whether or not there is a postseason in 2020. If there is a postseason, the players do receive their 75% prorated salary. If there isn’t, which will likely depend on the possible return of COVID-19, the players would only receive 50% prorated salary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is a far cry from the 100% prorated salaries the players want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yes, there is a proposal, but it doesn’t seem to have made it very far. Perhaps it will lead to further negotiating as the sides try to meet somewhere in the middle.</p>
