<h1>Man arrested after driving through building, jumping from bridge in Beltzhoover</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Brentwood man was arrested on Saturday after crashing into a building in Beltzhoover and later jumping off a bridge.</p>
<p>Anthony Terry, 35, was driving down Southern Avenue with a female passenger when the two began arguing over their children, according a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Terry had been trying to move back in with his children after a&nbsp;“slew of domestic episodes” with the woman, the complaint said. One incident resulted in Mr. Terry being charged with simple assault in February.</p>
<p>When the woman told him he couldn’t move back in, Mr. Terry threatened to kill himself and began accelerating towards West Warrington Avenue, the complaint said.</p>
<p>The vehicle crashed through the cinder block wall of the Ron Flora Automotive shop and damaged three other vehicles in the building. Mr. Terry then took off on foot toward the Liberty Tunnels.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh EMS, fire and police arrived at the scene in the 600 block of West Warrington Avenue around 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Medics tried to talk to Mr. Terry when he came back to the scene. He began to run towards Boggs Avenue, climbed a hill and jumped off the South Busway bridge, the complaint reads.&nbsp;Medics transported him to the hospital in critical condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The female victim was transported to a hospital. She had a broken nose, rib and ankle from the crash.</p>
<p>Mr. Terry faces several charges, including aggravated assault, causing or risking catastrophe, attempted homicide and four counts of criminal mischief.</p>
<p>Court records do not yet show a preliminary hearing slated for Mr. Terry. A preliminary hearing for the simple assault incident is set for June 25.</p>
