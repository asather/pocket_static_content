<h1>Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine recommends nighttime alcohol ban as Ohio reports highest coronavirus case count yet</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS — Gov. Mike DeWine called Thursday for a statewide emergency rule that would ban the sale of alcohol at all liquor establishments starting at 10 p.m. nightly.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine requested the Ohio Division of Liquor Control adopt the restrictions on a day that Ohio reported 1,733 new coronavirus cases, the highest daily case count yet for the state. If the commission follows Mr. DeWine’s recommendation, the rule will take effect on Friday.</p>
<p>“I’m mindful of the economic impacts that this has,” he said during a news conference announcing the plan. “But we have to slow the spread of virus, and we have to slow it down across the state of Ohio.”</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine cited outbreaks traced to bars in Toledo, Columbus, and other Ohio cities as justification for the measure.</p>
<p>The proposed rule would cover all establishments that serve alcoholic drinks, including restaurants, but it would allow for the consumption of any purchased alcohol until 11 p.m. The Division of Liquor Control will meet Friday at 9 a.m. to discuss the measure.</p>
<p>Although he said most bar owners are doing a “phenomenal job” of following guidelines, Mr. DeWine discussed investigations the state conducted last weekend that found a number of bars with no social distancing in place, including full outdoor patios and dance floors “packed shoulder to shoulder.”</p>
<p>He told one story of a young woman in her 20s who joined college friends for a night out at a few bars. Later she started feeling sick and found out her friends had the virus, and she in turn eventually passed it to her brother, parents and grandmother.</p>

<p>“We do not want to shut down Ohio bars and restaurants,” Mr. DeWine said. “That would be devastating to them, but we do need to take some action.”</p>
<p>Several Toledo bar owners said they understood the necessity of the rule but were worried about how it might impact business.</p>
<p>Sarah Mettler, a manager at Ye Olde Cock n’ Bull, said that many downtown bars are busiest late at night and will be directly affected by the order. She is planning on potentially having to cut her staff in half as a result.</p>
<p>“Obviously this will drastically affect us,” she said. “But safety first, so I get why he’s doing it.”</p>
<p>The Blarney Irish Pub, also downtown, has spent thousands of dollars on dividers and other safety measures to keep patrons safe.</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate what’s happening at some bars is affecting the rest of us,” said Ed Beczynski, the Blarney’s owner. “I’ve driven around and seen bars packed to the brim. He’s got to do something.”</p>
<p>Mr. Beczynski said he was unsurprised by the governor’s plan, as the Columbus City Council passed an ordinance Monday night forcing bars at restaurants to close at 10 p.m.</p>
<p>“Let’s try this for a couple of weeks and see where we are at,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine also applauded the State Pharmacy Board’s retraction Thursday morning of its decision banning the prescription and distribution of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for coronavirus.</p>
<p>“I believe that their process in arriving at this original decision was fundamentally flawed,” he said. “It really did not provide enough opportunity for people to comment.”</p>
<p>The board withdrew the rule, released Wednesday, at the governor’s request and after receiving feedback from the medical and patient community. It said in a statement that the move will allow them to “reexamine the issue … to determine the appropriate next steps.”</p>
<p>The anti-malarial drug, touted by President Trump, was recently shown in a large, randomized clinical trial to have no benefit in decreasing the likelihood of death from coronavirus or speeding up recovery. The Food and Drug Administration revoked emergency-use authorization for the drug in June.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine said his recommendation was not an endorsement of the drug, but instead an indication that he thinks the experts need to look at the issue more carefully.</p>
<p>“I do not have a position in regard to the use of this particular drug for COVID patients,” he explained. “That is not the job of the governor.”</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine cited an appearance Thursday morning on NBC’s Today Show by Stephen Hahn, the FDA commissioner, who said the decision to take hydroxychloroquine “should be made between a doctor and patient.”</p>
<p>Statewide, case counts have risen in rural counties and have fallen in urban counties. Although the rate of infection in urban counties is still high, Mr. DeWine explained, the increase in cases has slowed down.</p>
<p>He attributed the relative decrease in urban cases to a combination of mask orders being in place for long periods of time and anecdotal reports from local health departments of mask compliance increasing as a result.</p>
<p>“It is no accident that these two things are occurring together,” he said.</p>
<p>Lucas County’s seven-day case average has fallen from 74 cases a day as of July 22 to 38 cases a day as of Tuesday. While the number of new cases has decreased, the county’s overall rate of infection the past two weeks is still at 183 cases per 100,000 residents, almost doubling the federal Centers for Disease Control’s threshold for “high incidence” of spread.</p>
<p>As a result the Ohio Public Health Advisory System lists Lucas County as a Level 3 risk, tied for the highest-active risk of any Ohio county and indicative of “very high exposure and spread,” according the advisory system’s website.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine said that the news out of Lucas County was “not good,” mentioning outbreaks at restaurants, an assisted-living facility, and a day-care center.</p>
<p>Wood County is currently at Level 2, which means there is “increased exposure and spread” of the virus within the county. The Wood County Health Department reported 43 new cases on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases up to 857.</p>
<p>The Toledo-Lucas County Health Department reported a total of 4,343 cases in the county as of Thursday.</p>
