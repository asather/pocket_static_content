<h1>Penguins camp primer: Who starts in goal Game 1, and will he have a quick hook?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With the NHL targeting July 13 for the start of full-squad training camps in Phase 3 of its return-to-play plan, Penguins beat reporters Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are counting down the days until Penguins Camp Part Deux by examining some of the key questions that will be waiting when the team hits the ice:</em></p>
<p>The Penguins face in the near future a fascinating conundrum in the crease.</p>
<p>Both of their goalies, Matt Murray and Tristan Jarry, are scheduled to become restricted free agents this offseason, whenever the heck that may be. Murray has two Stanley Cup rings and a spotty track record in regular seasons. Jarry was just a first-time All-Star whose price tag should induce far less sticker shock.</p>
<p>Drop them into the uncertain financial landscape that the NHL and all free agents will have to navigate, and there are a few directions this all could go.</p>
<p>The decision Mike Sullivan and Co. will have to make in the next couple of weeks is a critical one, too. But it looks pretty straightforward at this point.</p>
<p>Do you really think the Penguins aren’t going with Murray for Game 1?</p>
<p>With so much at stake for a capable yet aging Penguins core, and so little certainty in a short series after a lengthy layoff since their last game, it would be stunning if Sullivan went with the guy who had never started an NHL playoff game over the one who got mobbed after the final buzzer of back-to-back Cup runs.</p>
<p>The three NHL analysts — Brian Boucher, Corey Hirsch and Brian Lawton — who <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/04/13/pittsburgh-penguins-goalies-matt-murray-tristan-jarry-nhl-offseason-trade-rumors-jim-rutherford/stories/202004130060" target="_blank">fairly recently chatted with the Post-Gazette</a> about the goaltending situation all agreed the Penguins would and should start off with Murray.</p>
<p>“Goaltending, it’s still between the ears. And this is a guy that’s won two Stanley Cups,” said Hirsch, the former NHL goalie turned Sportsnet talking head.</p>
<p>The goaltending situation has made for fine sports media fodder over the last six months. Murray had another uninspiring regular season. And Jarry, showing that he belonged in the NHL, was arguably the league’s top puck-stopper prior to the All-Star break. His savvy stick-handling was an added perk for Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>But, like the team in front of him, Jarry faded. From Jan. 1 on, his numbers were a tad below those of Murray, who was 9-5-1 with a .905 save percentage.</p>
<p>In February, Sullivan gave both goalies equal opportunity to seize the gig. When neither did, the coach appeared to make up his mind. Murray, a proven playoff performer who helped Sullivan earn his reputation as an elite NHL coach, started four of the team’s five games before the regular season halted March 12.</p>
<p>In media interviews in recent weeks, neither Sullivan nor general manager Jim Rutherford stated that Murray would be in goal for Game 1 of their five-game, play-in series against the Montreal Canadiens. However, they also did not declare that there would be an open competition during training camp.</p>
<p>Murray, as he should be, is preparing as if he’ll be the man for the playoffs.</p>
<p>“I’m going to do everything I can do to be sharp and to be at my best to help this team win another Stanley Cup,” he said in a recent chat with local media.</p>
<p>The more intriguing question, at least from this couch, centers on what Sullivan and the Penguins will do if Murray struggles at the start of the postseason.</p>
<p>Sullivan has shown an acute feel for goaltending decisions during his five years in Pittsburgh, along with the courage to make unpopular calls in the best interest of his team. Marc-Andre Fleury saved the day in 2017 but Sullivan turned back to Murray, who delivered with stingy series against Ottawa and Nashville.</p>
<p>If his goalie laid an egg in Game 1 of the Canadiens series, would the coach feel pressure to make a switch? Will it take a pair of atrocious performances? What if the goalie can’t stop a beach ball but the Penguins go up in the series anyway?</p>
<p>No one, including Sullivan, can answer that now. It will come down to feel.</p>
<p>Hirsch said Murray, despite his playoff pedigree, should be “on a short leash.” But he believes you “start with your veteran guy” and see if he steps up again.</p>
<p>“There’s a feeling in the locker room, guys have confidence in Murray and know he can do it,” the Sportsnet analyst said. “So you don’t want to take that doubt away from them. There’s a confidence thing there. … He was fantastic. Teams are begging for that kind of guy. And you’re going to sit him on the bench?”</p>
