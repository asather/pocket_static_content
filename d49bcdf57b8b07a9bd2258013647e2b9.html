<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the early hours of Friday morning, agents from the state Attorney General’s office, Monroeville police detectives and Penn Hills detectives executed a search warrant at a Penn Hills residence where police say they found heroin, crack cocaine and evidence of dog fighting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 6 a.m. Friday, officers arrived at the house of Crystal McDonald on Calvin Street where they found 1,430 stamp bags of heroin with an estimated street value of $14,300, 35 grams of crack cocaine with a street value of $3,400, guns, over $12,000 in cash, and evidence of a possible dog fighting ring, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Once in the home, they found Ms. McDonald and her four year old son. When interviewed by police, Ms. McDonald said she denied knowing any of the narcotics were in her house, and she only knew of one firearm being in the house, which was located in her four year old’s bed room. Ms. McDonald told police she sleeps with her child in the bedroom, according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police are charging Ms. McDonald with seven counts of cruelty to animals, 16 counts of neglect of animals, two counts of animal fighting, one count of aggravated cruelty to animal, three counts of prohibited acts, two counts of prohibited acts of possession with intent to deliver and one count of endangering welfare of children. Police have also filed similar charges for Juqea Lamar Sears in connection to the drugs found and the evidence of possible dog fighting, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>McDonald was placed under arrest and transported to the Monroeville Police Department, where she was held in a holding cell during processing, according to the criminal complaint. While under the search warrant, detectives discovered items and activity&nbsp;“relating to animal abuse and dog fighting,” according to a criminal complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detectives say they found seven dogs in the rear of the house with some dogs showing evidence of injuries police say they suspect were from fights with other dogs. Detectives also found a weighted dog collar and weighted dog vest, which are both “commonly used for conditioning and training the dogs for fighting,” according to the complaint. The dogs were taken by animal control and transported to the Monroeville Animal Shelter, according to the criminal complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When police interviewed Crystal McDonald at the Monroeville Police Department, police say McDonald admitted to placing the weighted collar and weighted vest on the dogs and would have them bite the tire for&nbsp;“conditioning purposes.”&nbsp;</p>
