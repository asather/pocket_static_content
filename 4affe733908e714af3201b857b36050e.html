<p>A college basketball coach has been indicted on numerous counts of child exploitation and production of child pornography involving underage girls from Pennsylvania and Ohio.</p>
<p>Jacob Kolonis, assistant basketball coach at Washington &amp; Jefferson College, is named in a 16-count charge handed up under seal on July 8.</p>
<p>The case was unsealed Monday in U.S. District Court.</p>
<p>The grand jury said Mr. Kolonis, 27, of Duncansville, Blair County, coerced two Ohio girls and a Pennsylvania girl, all identified only by initials, to engage in sexual activity in November 2019 for the purpose of making recordings.</p>
<p>The grand jury said he sent the videos to all the girls and also sent threatening messages to them and four other girls.</p>
<p>Mr. Kolonis is charged with interstate transmission of an extortion communication, production of material depicting the sexual exploitation of a minor, receipt of that material, and transfer of obscene material to a minor.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office has requested that Mr. Kolonis be detained. No attorney was listed for him in court records.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, in August 2019 and on Nov. 22, 2019, Nov. 28, 2019, and Feb. 5 through 7 of this year, Mr. Kolonis knowingly transmitted threats to seven minor females with the intent to extort them. In addition to communicating the threats, he attempted to produce and produced live video depictions of three of the girls in Ohio and Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Washington &amp; Jefferson did not immediately return a message Monday.</p>
