<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A student and elementary school teacher in the North Hills School District have tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The school district sent emails to parents Saturday that a North Hills High School student has a presumed positive case and that a third-grade teacher at Highcliff Elementary in Ross was in the building Monday and Tuesday, then had symptoms on Wednesday. She was tested on Thursday and received the positive result Saturday.</p>
<p>Following Allegheny County Health Department guidance, the teacher will remain in isolation for a 10-day period beginning Aug. 29. She did not return to the school after her symptoms started.</p>
<p>Highcliff principal Kristy Bilderback will be notifying the families whose students were in the teacher’s class on Tuesday and Wednesday, and anyone else who had close contact with her while she was in the building.</p>
<p>The health department will contact anyone who had close contact with the teacher and the High School student, in the event additional close contacts are identified.</p>
<p>Students were in all of the district’s buildings Tuesday through Friday at 25% capacity to receive their district iPads and other items necessary for virtual instruction, which begins Monday. The district said its health and safety plan, which includes masks and social distancing, was followed while the students were in the buildings.</p>
