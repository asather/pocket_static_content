<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A woman in Lawrence County was injured Monday when she was shot at least once by a Pennsylvania State Police trooper, who said the woman refused to drop her weapon.</p>
<p>Troopers responded just after 9 a.m. to a call near Copper Road in Slippery Rock Township that a woman was causing a disturbance.</p>
<p>Two troopers arrived on the scene together and encountered the woman, who police said was armed.</p>
<p>"She failed to comply with the demands of the troopers," said Trooper R. Dan Kesten, a spokesman at Troop D in Lawrence County. "The troopersâ€™ lives became endangered and they fired at her."</p>
<p>Trooper Kesten said at least one trooper fired on the woman, whose identity has not been released. He did not know how many times she was struck or what type of weapon she was holding.</p>
<p>The shooting is being investigated by the state police's Major Case Team. Trooper Kesten said charges are being prepared against the woman, who&nbsp;was taken to a hospital. Her condition was not immediately known.</p>
<p>Neither trooper was injured in the incident, Trooper Kesten said.</p>
