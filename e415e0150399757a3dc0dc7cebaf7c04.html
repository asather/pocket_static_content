<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: What's your best-case scenario for the Pirates?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat Steelers with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @PaulZeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Theresa:</strong> What is the best case scenario for the Pirates? I say 72 wins.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Well the best-case scenario means just about everything goes right. That means Gregory Polanco is healthy, can play 130 games or so and hits with some power and consistency. That means we see more of 2018 Trevor Williams than 2019 Trevor Williams. That means we see May 2019 Josh Bell and he stays healthy. That means Mitch Keller progresses and Bryan Reynolds and Kevin Newman don’t regress. That means Chris Archer shakes off a five-year slump and becomes the pitcher his stuff makes us think he should be. That means the catchers aren’t terrible at the plate. That also means a few of those bullpen arms, such as Kyle Crick, find some level of consistency. And if all of that were to happen, I could see this team winning 78-80 games. But the likelihood that all of that happens is very slim. I would say a realistic place to be optimistic is 72-73 wins, with 68-69 wins the most likely outcome of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Dave J:</strong> Who would you make the Opening Day starter if you were Derek Shelton? I look at this staff and think they should just go with an opener idea on Opening Day because there isn’t a starter worthy of that honor.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Wow, Dave, tell us how you really feel. I would say give the ball to Joe Musgrove on Opening Day. He has the right mentality for that kind of spot and he had some level of success last season. I like a lot about him, I just wish he would pitch with more consistency.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> I keep hearing every talk about Ke’Bryan Hayes. He has no power at all. He is going to be a third baseman of the future and he doesn’t hit home runs? Why won’t anyone talk about giving Colin Moran a chance to prove he can be a third baseman for the long haul?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Colin Moran is never going to be an above average fielder, that’s why. He will struggle to ever be an average fielder for that matter. He’s a very good bench/platoon player because he is a decent hitter, but you can’t have him in your everyday lineup. And while he does have a little pop, I’d say the emphasis is on the word little. He isn’t going to be the middle of the lineup guy you want from third base or anything close to that.</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence:</strong> After watching the video of Ben Roethlisberger throwing, I have to wonder has he ever heard of eating salads? He looks like he is 40 pounds overweight. How can he be working hard at rehab and be so out of shape?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Well his name is Big Ben... I don’t know what he has done in terms of working out this offseason, but my guess is he has been very limited. He has never had a reputation as a workout junkie. He’s going to be fine in terms of being in shape to play football by the time the season comes. The greater concern is will his arm be ready?</p>
<p><strong>Greg:</strong> The Steelers have a lot of offensive holes, but I am worried about the defense too. Don’t you think they need to add at least one more linebacker, especially if they are going to cut Anthony Chickillo?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> They do need to add an inexpensive depth linebacker. They will likely cut Chickillo and may even cut Mark Barron, so there will be a need. But I would hate to see them use their first draft choice this year (it’s in the second round at No. 49) on a defensive player. They need help at tight end, offensive line, running back and receiver. They can pick up a depth linebacker in free agency late in the process when the prices for veteran free agents come way down.</p>
<p><strong>Joe:&nbsp;</strong>Why did Jeff Capel feel the need to say he “inherited a dumpster fire” in a recent press conference? Even if he is right, it comes across as excuse making. Kevin Stallings came here when Jaime Dixon left the cupboard bare, yet I didn’t hear Stallings blame him.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> It was a bizarre postgame rant, to be honest. I didn’t understand why he felt the need to go there. There is no pressure on him to win. The administration just gave him an extension, the media have mostly praised him for what he has done and the fan base — outside of the lunatic fringe that is never happy — seems to be happy. I didn’t think he needed to lash out like that, either. It doesn’t help him and everyone understands the process and how hard it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sean:</strong> Paul, what are your thoughts on an NBA team in Pittsburgh? After watching the All-Star Game it’s clear that the NBA is more diverse and focuses more on the fan experience, giving back to the communities and is proactive in making the league better. I would love to have an NBA team in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I would love it, too, but it’s a long shot and then some. I don’t think I will ever see it in my lifetime, and I don’t think it will ever happen. There just isn’t enough corporate money in this town to fully support four professional franchises. The NBA isn’t going to expand to a city that isn’t going to build a new arena and guarantee a lot of already sold corporate suites. It would be fun, though.</p>
