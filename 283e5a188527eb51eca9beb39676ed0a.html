<h1>Study: Blood plasma drawn from COVID-19 survivors to be tested on ill patients</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Using blood from people who survived infection to treat those seriously ill with it goes back to the late 19th century measles outbreak, the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic and more recent outbreaks of measles and Ebola.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with no time to lose during those epidemics, no one took time to study the outcomes of the “convalescent plasma or sera” treatment.</p>
<p>That’s about to change.</p>
<p>On Monday, UPMC, the Allegheny Health Network and Vitalant-Pittsburgh, the center that provides blood and transfusion services, announced plans to draw blood plasma from COVID-19 survivors for use in treating patients seriously ill with the infection.</p>
<p>Donated plasma from survivors contains a rich supply of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The plasma&nbsp;will be used in an attempt to boost a patient’s immune response against the virus.</p>
<p>Results from the local study will be incorporated into the&nbsp;Mayo Clinic’s national Convalescent Plasma Expanded Access Program to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Darrel Triulzi, medical director for Clinical Services at Vitalant-Pittsburgh, said he hopes Vitalant can begin collecting plasma from donors this week, leading to doses being available within a week.</p>
<p>“We’ve been working on this daily for three weeks —&nbsp;every day — to get it organized,” Dr. Triulzi said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Vitalant will only accept donors who meet Food and Drug Administration criteria, which include having&nbsp;been diagnosed with COViD-19 through a laboratory test, and having remained symptom-free for at least 14 days, although the local requirement has been expanded to 21 days to ensure full recovery.</p>
<p>Donors also must undergo a test demonstrating they are currently COVID-negative.</p>
<p>Those who think they may be eligible can respond directly to either UPMC or AHN at the following email addresses — <a href="mailto:c2p3@upmc.edu" target="_blank">c2p3@upmc.edu</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:c2p3@ahn.org" target="_blank">c2p3@ahn.org</a>&nbsp;— or through the&nbsp;<a href="/Vitalant.org/covidfree" target="_blank">Vitalant.org/covidfree</a>&nbsp;website. Potential donors also can call Vitalant at&nbsp;877-25-VITAL (877-258-4825).</p>
<p>Vitalant-Pittsburgh is among a dozen <a href="https://www.vitalant.org/About-Us/Purpose-Network.aspx" target="_blank">Vitalant centers</a> that provide blood and transfusions services to 1,000 hospitals in 40 states. The organization routinely collects blood platelets and plasma from donors — a process that takes 45 minutes to an hour to complete.</p>
<p>Donated plasma then must be tested for concentrations of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and, to provide safety to the recipient, for the presence of any other infections the donor may have.</p>
<p>Up to four doses of treatment are possible from each donation, with potential for hundreds of doses being generated locally —&nbsp;given the 876 confirmed case to date in Allegheny County alone — to help severely ill patients and supply enough treatments to conduct the study, Dr. Triulzi said.</p>
<p>The local initiative got underway after the Food and Drug Administration released an emergency new drug investigation on March 24 allowing for compassionate use of convalescent plasma.</p>
<p>“We are extremely pleased to participate in this effort, which brings a promising investigational treatment to hospitalized patients in our region who are battling severe COVID-19 infections,” said&nbsp;Dr. Tom Walsh, an infectious disease specialist leading the project at AHN.</p>
<p>For now, he said,&nbsp;it’s unknown “what that impact convalescent plasma will have on COVID-19.”</p>
<p>To date its use has been limited to two so-called “case series” analyses, the first involving five critically ill patients with COVID-19 on ventilation but with high levels of the virus despite antiviral therapies.</p>
<p>“Administration of convalescent plasma was followed by improvement in their clinical status of virus [levels],” Dr. Walsh said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In another case series of 10 patients with severe COVID-19, [convalescent plasma] therapy was well tolerated with no severe adverse events noted while several markers of illness severity improved quickly,” he said.</p>
<p>“Data gathered from large regional collaboratives such as ours with Vitalant and UPMC will help further clarify the magnitude of impact [convalescent plasma] can have for patients with severe COVID-19,” he said.</p>
<p>The treatment was evaluated during the 2003 SARS epidemic caused by a coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV-2, he said, and also was “associated with reduced hospital length of stay” with a 7% to 23% lower mortality. “No severe adverse events were noted,” he said.</p>
<p>The therapy again was studied during the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic “and was associated with an 80% reduction in mortality in one study,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr. John McDyer, director of the University of Pittsburgh/UPMC&nbsp;Lung Transplantation Translational Research Program, said convalescent plasma faces extra hurdles as a treatment.</p>
<p>“It’s not a drug off the shelf and requires us to identify individuals whose infection is resolved and to collect [plasma] safely — an added layer of complexity,” he said.</p>
<p>Initially, doses will be used exclusively to treat the most severely infected patients. As more doses become available, those with less severe symptoms also could be treated to help determine how effective the treatment is in early stages of infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. McDyer said colleagues used the plasma treatment in New York and Florida on extremely sick COVID-19 patients, who tolerated the treatment well, “and that is, in itself, gratifying to hear.”</p>
