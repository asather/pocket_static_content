<h1>Jeff Capel stresses Pitt's 'stuff isn't going to be pretty.' But can it be effective?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With each passing word, there became something unmistakably familiar about the message and image Jeff Capel was projecting as he described the identity he wants from his team.</p>
<p>“Our stuff isn’t going to be pretty,” the Pitt coach said last Thursday. “We have to be the hungry team. We have to be the team that has a chip on our shoulder. We have to understand that defense is what we have to hang our hat on. We’re not a pretty offensive team. We have to be the dirty work guys, the grit, the toughness, defending, physical blockouts. We have to go get the basketball. If the ball’s on the floor, we have to be the first to get it.”</p>
<p>Hunger. Not pretty. Toughness. Grit.</p>
<p>They’re words synonymous with the blue-collar past of an increasingly white-collar city Capel now calls home, but in the context of basketball, they’re the traits that were central to the identity of the teams of the most successful era of Pitt history. In those years, from 2001-11, the Panthers became one of the most consistently excellent programs in college basketball by being the toughest, most physical team in the sport’s toughest, most physical conference with an offense that was pretty on paper — finishing among the top 20 teams in offensive efficiency seven times in that span — but, with a plodding pace of play, was taxing to watch at times.</p>
<p>At 10-4 this season heading into Wednesday’s game at North Carolina, 24-23 under Capel and 48-64 over the past four seasons, Pitt’s a far cry from what it was in that time. If it’s ever going to come close to reaching that summit again, at least under Capel, it will have to embody those characteristics its coach so badly wants to see n a nightly basis.&nbsp;This season, it will be especially important.</p>
<p>Offensively, the Panthers have been an unnerving adventure, capable and even exciting in some moments while helpless and self-destructive in many others. Through 14 games, they’re 11th among the ACC’s 15 teams in adjusted offensive efficiency, averaging 104 points per 100 possessions (about one point fewer than they did last year with a less talented roster). Additionally, they’re 12th in field goal percentage (41.8%) and 14th in 3-point percentage (29.1%). When combined with a tempo that makes them one of the 20 slowest teams in the country, highlighting those shortcomings that much more, the Panthers are too frequently difficult and frustrating to watch.</p>
<p>They’ve been better on the other end, ranking ninth in defensive efficiency in the ACC. Even that aspect of their game, once reliable, has faded recently, as they’ve allowed each of their past two opponents, Canisius and Wake Forest, to average 1.06 points per possession or better after seeing that happen only three times in their first 12 games.</p>
<p>“We have to try to make it a challenge, make it be hard to score against us,” Capel said. “If we go zone, it has to be active. Our communication has to be there.”</p>
<p>Improving offensively will have to be a collective effort. Though it’s down from what it was last season, Xavier Johnson and Trey McGowens are handling the ball at a much higher rate than their teammates and the sophomore guards are often the ones operating the offense in the final minutes of a tight game.&nbsp;Functioning as an offense, however, goes well beyond that duo.</p>
<p>“There has to be a toughness,” Capel said Monday. “There has to be a togetherness. We have to do that. It’s not just X and Trey. I didn’t single them out and no one should single them out. Just like when we win, it’s not just Xavier and Trey. This is Pittsburgh basketball. This is not Xavier and Trey and the Pittsburgh Panthers. We have to do it together. For the most part, we’ve done that all year. It just didn’t happen for us Saturday afternoon [in a loss to Wake Forest].”</p>
<p>That toughness and togetherness can manifest itself in many ways. In the case of shooting guard Ryan Murphy, it’s an ever-motivated mindset that propels a player who, by his own admission, isn’t the most physically intimidating person.</p>
<p>“I definitely play with an edge,” Murphy said Saturday following the Wake Forest loss. “I feel like I’m an underdog. I look like a frat boy. I have a comb over and I’m about 6-2. Every night I go out there, I feel like I have to prove everyone wrong.”</p>
<p>The qualities Capel wants to see from his team aren’t limited to Pitt’s current predicament. If it ever rises in the ACC standings in the coming years, it will likely be due to the foundation of a program he has established.</p>
<p>Those characteristics can’t be used solely as fuel for that ascent. It has to remain that way.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that has anything to do with talent,” Capel said. “When you look at winning programs, whether it’s on our level or the professional level, they do the dirty work. They are on the floor for loose balls. They do defend at a high level. There’s a physicality to them. They take charges. They’re together. Their communication is at a very high level. To me, when I say that, that’s just trying to become a winning program. That’s what we’re trying to build this thing to become.”</p>
<p><strong>NOTE —&nbsp;</strong>Capel said Monday that there is no update on the health or playing status of sophomore forward Au’Diese Toney, who <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/01/04/pitt-panthers-basketball-au-diese-toney-acc-wake-forest/stories/202001040035" target="_blank">missed Saturday’s loss to Wake Forest</a> with an elbow injury.</p>
