<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh International Airport will receive another $3.6 million in federal aid designed to help with needed improvements even as it deals with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations.</p>
<p>The Findlay airport is one of seven in the state to be awarded more than $46 million by the Federal Aviation Administration, with part of the money coming from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.</p>

<p>U.S. Sen Bob Casey announced the awarding of the grants Wednesday.</p>
<p>The $3.6 million awarded to the Pittsburgh airport is on top of the $36 million it got from the FAA in April to maintain operations and to replace revenue that all but evaporated because of the steep decline in travel precipitated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>While that round of funding was designed to offset losses, the $3.6 million will be used to replace 13 pre-conditioned air systems at gates in the airside building’s C and D concourses.</p>
<p>The systems are used to pump cool or heated air into jets while they are parked at gates while awaiting takeoff or after landing. The units reduce the need to keep plane engines running.</p>
<p>According to the airport, the current air systems have reached the end of their lifespan and need to be replaced.</p>
<p>The money was awarded under the FAA’s voluntary airport low emissions program.</p>
<p>“As the economy continues to stall due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our airports need federal help to implement much-needed infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation,” Mr. Casey said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to a U.S. Department of Transportation list, Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Latrobe will get $5.1 million to reconstruct a taxiway and strengthen a runway.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Airport in West Mifflin will receive $544,874 for safety area-related improvements.</p>
<p>The largest grants — nearly $18.4 million — in Pennsylvania went to Philadelphia International Airport for work that included reconstructing a taxiway and rehabbing a runway.</p>
