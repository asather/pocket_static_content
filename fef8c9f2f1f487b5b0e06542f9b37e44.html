<h1>Pitt police department has 'no intention' of rehiring Michael Rosfeld</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh Police Department says it has no plans to rehire a former East Pittsburgh officer who was acquitted of homicide in the 2018 shooting death of unarmed black teenager Antwon Rose II.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to Twitter on Sunday, the department said the university is “vigorously opposing” Michael Rosfeld’s lawsuit — filed back in January — in federal court.</p>
<p>“We continue to argue that his claim is baseless,” the statement said.&nbsp;“... our department is committed to maintaining the safety of all members of our community and advancing the University’s relentless pursuit of an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding among all of our community members.”</p>
<p>Michael Rosfeld, of Penn Hills, claims Pitt violated his due process rights and the 14th Amendment by firing him in January 2018 without an internal hearing after he arrested Daniel Humphrey, the son of senior Vice Chancellor Kathy W. Humphrey, outside a bar in December 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, filed Jan. 16 in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court, Mr. Rosfeld specifically claims that Ms. Humphrey “intervened and acted in concert with” Pitt and university police Chief James Loftus “in retaliation for the actions of Plaintiff Rosfeld in effecting the arrest of her son Daniel Humphrey.”</p>
<p>The suit claims that the morning after Mr. Rosfeld arrested Mr. Humphrey and two others who had been kicked out of the Garage Door Saloon on Atwood Street in Oakland, two police department supervisors came to his house to tell him he was under investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six weeks later, on Jan. 18, 2018, according to the lawsuit, Chief Loftus terminated Mr. Rosfeld via a memo that was handed to him during a meeting at Pitt police headquarters.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosfeld was acquitted by a jury in March 2019 of homicide in the June 2018 shooting death of Antwon, 17, in East Pittsburgh.&nbsp;Mr. Rosfeld fatally shot Antwon in the back while the unarmed teen ran from a traffic stop just minutes after being with a friend who committed a drive-by shooting in North Braddock.</p>
<p>The university said it is offering support for students experiencing anxiety and stress in light of Mr. Rosfeld’s lawsuit.</p>
