<h1>To roam or restrain? COVID-19 outbreak in behavioral health unit challenges VA Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The COVID-19 virus, mostly likely carried by an employee who felt fine, had sickened a patient in a most vulnerable spot at the Pittsburgh VA Medical Center in Oakland: a third-floor inpatient behavioral health unit.</p>
<p>By the time VA staff discovered this, the patient had spread&nbsp;the contagion to others on a floor where residents’ freedom to roam is considered essential — they&nbsp;watch TV in the communal lounge, snack in the communal dining room and seek treatment in the communal therapy areas. Restraints are widely condemned.</p>

<p>The floor, which on Friday counted 10 patients in that unit and several staff members who have tested positive for COVID-19,&nbsp;is now the center of an inpatient outbreak at the&nbsp;Pittsburgh VA Healthcare System.</p>
<p>The outbreak illustrates how the virus can invade and quickly spread among patients least capable of fighting it off, even as the Pittsburgh VA reports comparatively low figures and Allegheny County officials talk of a flattening curve of new cases.</p>
<p>It presents an extraordinary challenge for VA staff, even in a time in which health care providers everywhere have been forced to pivot to prepare its defenses during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>In an interview Friday, Don Koenig, director of the Pittsburgh VA, said staff in the behavioral health unit immediately leaped into action at the first positive test. They tested all the patients and continuously monitored them for COVID-19 symptoms, like fever and cough.</p>
<p>Staff also&nbsp;encouraged residents to keep six feet apart and wear masks, he said, but the unique layout of the unit sometimes proved difficult to manage. The patients are generally not geriatric but can be older.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of different from a normal hospital room, where we could bring things directly to them,” Mr. Koenig said. “They have an individual bedroom and individual bathroom, but they spend most of the day not in that room.”</p>
<p>The VA decided against the use of any physical restraints or medications that would render a patient unable to move freely.</p>
<p>“We use that as an absolutely last resort and would not be able to justify, because of potential exposure to COVID, that justifies restraining someone,” Mr. Koenig said. He added that “many of the patients were very cooperative and understanding.”</p>
<p><strong>‘They’re sitting ducks’</strong></p>
<p>Experts in behavioral health and geriatric psychiatry described a delicate situation for nurses who must balance patients’ rights with the risk of widespread harm to an entire unit.</p>
<p>Allowing residents to move about freely “is a great good” and a cornerstone of the nursing principles that promote patient welfare,&nbsp;said Karl Steinberg, president-elect of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.</p>
<p>But unrestricted movement, in the case of COVID-19, also could clash with nurses’ “do no harm” mantra.</p>
<p>“If you’re allowing these people to move around and they’re potentially carrying this deadly virus or contagious, you’re essentially not caring for the other people,” Dr. Steinberg said.&nbsp;“Geriatric patients, whether it’s nursing homes or in psych units — they’re sitting ducks. They’re the most vulnerable.”</p>
<p>VA employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss facility conditions, said they believed VA management had granted the patients too much mobility, needlessly infecting other patients who were otherwise healthy at the time.</p>
<p>Calls from workers in the behavioral health unit inundated union officials with the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents about 3,500 employees at VA Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Multiple staff members have fallen ill in that unit, according to two employees. Some employees were in the dark about the extent of the COVID-19 cases on the floor until several patients had already tested positive.</p>
<p>According to VA Pittsburgh, 40 employees were absent last week for reasons related to COVID-19, and nine employees have tested positive for the virus.&nbsp;A VA spokeswoman would not share which units those employees were working in.</p>
<p>Experts said, in the case of a serious outbreak, healthy patients must be isolated from sick ones if they can be provided an open space —&nbsp;it is not enough to attempt to keep them apart.</p>
<p>“If you’re keeping them together, [the virus] is going to rapidly spread, because you cannot physically stop their movements,” said Barbara Kolonay, president of Holistic Aging, a Hampton-based aging life care management practice in business for 18 years.</p>
<p>Another potential avenue for the virus arose from a need to share knowledge: Behavioral health specialists needed assistance from medical nurses and infectious disease experts in managing the outbreak in a unit unaccustomed to such medical care.</p>
<p>With such movements comes the risk of spreading COVID-19 further,&nbsp;Ms. Kolonay said.</p>
<p>“It’s really important that the same staff is working there, and they’re not on other units,”&nbsp;Ms. Kolonay said.</p>
<p>In the interview, Mr. Koenig emphasized VA employees who are treating COVID-19 patients and working in the emergency room have access to “more than enough” personal protective equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VA Pittsburgh has asked employees who are not treating those patients to bring in their own cloth masks from home, he said. And for those wearing surgical masks, VA Pittsburgh has recommended using it for a full week. “Obviously, if it becomes soiled or becomes wet, you get a new one,” Mr. Koenig said.</p>
<p>“To the extent you can keep it dry and reusable, CDC guidelines says that is appropriate when there are international and national shortages,” Mr. Koenig said.</p>
<p>VA Pittsburgh also will begin a new sterilization technique this week to clean N95 masks up to three or four times, he said.</p>
<p>As of Friday, the&nbsp;Pittsburgh&nbsp;VA Medical Center reported 21 positive COVID-19 cases and one death caused by the virus. Of those, eight were patients who had sought testing at the VA and were recovering at their homes in quarantine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the inpatient cases, three are veterans in intensive care units. The other 10 cases are on the behavioral health floor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the behavioral health patients have been moved to the intensive care unit, a VA spokeswoman said. She declined to provide any more detail on the veteran who had died, citing privacy laws.</p>
<p><strong>Mirroring a trend</strong></p>
<p>The rise in cases at the Pittsburgh VA have mirrored national trends.</p>
<p>The medical center reported its first positive COVID-19 case on March 26. At that time, the VA’s nationwide statistics showed that 484 patients across the country had tested positive and that six patients had died.</p>
<p>In the last three weeks, those nationwide figures have grown to more than 5,000 positive cases as of Friday, with more than 300 deaths across more than 120 health care facilities.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh VA has avoided the type of widespread outbreaks seen in places like New Orleans, New York, New Jersey and Chicago. As of Friday, New Orleans reported the most positive cases at 436, and New York City reported the highest number of deaths at 36.</p>
<p>In the interview, Mr. Koenig credited strict protocols enforced by the medical center and the VA’s second facility in O’Hara. In preparation for the COVID-19 outbreak, the VA shifted elective procedures and shifted patient visits to telehealth platforms, he said. Daily in-person visits to the Pittsburgh VA dropped by more than 90%, he said, from 2,500 to about 240.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VA employees entering the facilities have been subject to temperature checks and must disclose their symptoms or exposure to someone who has tested positive for the virus. Employees who are sent home must notify their doctor and seek testing on their own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The O’Hara facility has been locked down with the heightened concern of patients in the VA’s nursing home, known as the community living center. The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/28/VA-Pittsburgh-reports-first-positive-test-in-patient/stories/202003280041" target="_blank">first employee case was reported</a> in a nursing manager who advises a staff of nurses at the center, raising worries the virus could infect an elderly population.</p>
<p>A grievance <a href="https://www.afge.org/globalassets/documents/generalreports/coronavirus/4/va-ng-4-9-20-ffcra.pdf" target="_blank">filed nationally by the AFGE</a> accuses the VA of not providing paid leave under legislation passed by Congress last month. Mr. Koenig said he was still waiting on guidance on the federal sick leave policy but that employees could apply for administrative leave, provided at the VA’s cost, if they were off work awaiting a COVID-19 test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dean Balouris, an AFGE official, said the contract clearly states all employees turned away from work are owed paid leave.</p>
<p>“Employees turned away from the facility because of pandemic-related reasons, they are to be paid administrative leave,” Mr. Balouris said. VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System is “refusing to follow the guidelines."</p>
