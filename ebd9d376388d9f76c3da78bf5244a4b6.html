<h1>Hypocritical change</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., on March 16, 2016, released the following statement regarding the nomination of Merrick Garland by then-President Barack Obama to become an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court:</p>
<p>“With the U.S. Supreme Court’s balance at stake, and with the presidential election fewer than eight months away, it is wise to give the American people a more direct voice in the selection and confirmation of the next justice.”</p>
<p>The 2020 presidential election is now about 40 days away. I sincerely hope that Mr. Toomey now feels — as he did in 2016 when a Supreme Court vacancy opened up eight months before the presidential election — that “it is wise to give the American people a more direct voice in the selection and confirmation of the next justice” and that for this reason the vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg should be filled by the next president.</p>
<p>If Mr. Toomey does not feel that the position he endorsed in 2016 is applicable in 2020, I welcome his explanation of how this change of view represents anything other than rank hypocrisy, naked partisanship, or both.</p>
