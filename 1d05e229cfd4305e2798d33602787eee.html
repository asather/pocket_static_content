<h1>Friends, musicians remember Pittsburgh's Uzell Finney Jr. of The Flow Band</h1>

<p>To a city known to be mostly cloudy, Uzell Finney Jr. added more than his share of Caribbean sunshine.</p>
<p>Finney, who died of prostate cancer Tuesday at 65, was a retired firefighter from Engine Company 20 in West Homestead and founder and guitarist for The Flow Band, which formed in the early 1980s and endured as Pittsburgh’s longest-running reggae band.</p>
<p>The East Liberty native’s musical life began while he was at Allderdice High School in the early ’70s,</p>
<p>“He used to bring his guitar to school and play it on the Allderdice front lawn,” says former classmate and fellow musician David Wells.&nbsp;“The ladies liked him and would gather round. We would jam together. He <em>always</em> had a positive attitude, big smile and kind word to say. Soft spoken, peaceful and kind. One of the truly good guys.”</p>
<p>In the band scene, Finney’s original interest was jazz.</p>
<p>“We started back in 1976,” says reggae singer Tony Miles, originally from Beaver Falls. “He would come by my house and pick me up to play sax in his jazz band, called Abraxis. He was a great musician. He was reading music and learning how to read music. He had his music books with him all the time. He was an awesome musician, man.”</p>
<p>Abraxas evolved into Rastafari, the first reggae band in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“We opened up for just about every reggae band in Jamaica,” Miles recalls.</p>
<p>They were even set to open for Bob Marley’s last ever-concert, at the Stanley Theater in 1980, but when they got there, they learned that Marley was very ill; because things were so up in the air, Rita Marley’s I-Three’s opened instead.</p>
<p>When Rastafari split in 1982, Miles formed The Core and Finney formed The Clouds. That latter became The Flow when Miles told bassist Joe Smith, “you never speak up, you just go with the flow.” Miles would eventually hook back up with Finney in the Flow Band, before moving to California.</p>
<p>In short order, The Flow Band became one of the city’s hardest-working bands, often playing multiple shows a week, whether in clubs, private gigs or festivals. Just about every Pittsburgher had to have crossed paths with The Flow Band at some point.</p>
<p>“I knew Uzell from when I first came to Pittsburgh as a British Jamaican musician in the late ’80s,” says Antonee First Class, now a member of The English Beat. “I had to find where the live music was. Everybody loved Uzell. If it wasn’t for people like Uzell, there wouldn’t be reggae in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>The Flow Band became the go-to group to open for international acts, including Third World, Dennis Brown, Ziggy Marley, Ladysmith Black Mambazo and even Jimmy Buffett.</p>
<p>Finney, who performed right up until the last week of January, had two daughters, Lyric and Jurnee, with his wife Traceanne. He did special events for children and can be seen in many tender photos playing guitar for young kids.</p>
<p>Fellow musician Hill Jordan wrote on Facebook Wednesday, “Uzell was a great singer, monumental guitarist &amp; had a truly million dollar smile! &amp; when the music was RIGHT he would definitely flash that smile. He’d also have these deeply soulful solos on guitar sometimes that would have the WHOLE band like...WOW!!! Uzell &amp; I also shared a very deep love of gardening which is all about the life cycle. I will deeply miss my friend &amp; I wish him well on the next leg of his Journey.”</p>
<p>The Flow Band will perform a tribute to him at 7 p.m. Saturday at Cafe on the Corner, North Side.</p>
<p>Funeral arrangements are pending.</p>
