<h1>VoteSafe Pennsylvania begins effort to educate voters on how safely cast votes in November</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A few dozen of Pennsylvania’s elected officials and party stalwarts —&nbsp;including former Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy and all six of the state’s living former governors —&nbsp;will spend the next three-and-a-half months trying to educate voters on how they can cast their ballots in November’s election.</p>
<p>VoteSafe Pennsylvania, a coalition that launched a statewide campaign on Tuesday, will bring together officials from both parties to try to allay any fears voters may have about voting in the midst of a pandemic. They will try to explain to them their choices on how to safely do so —&nbsp;whether it be vote-by-mail or heading to an in-person precinct.</p>
<p>In addition to running an educational campaign, the coalition will advocate for counties to obtain more resources from the federal government —&nbsp;in order to ensure that voting by mail and in-person are safe, secure and accessible and that the results are counted in a timely manner, said co-chairman Dave Reed, former Republican Majority Leader of the state House.</p>
<p>“No matter the outcome [of November’s election], ensuring that everybody has the opportunity to have their vote be counted and are confident that they’re counted accurately, I think, is going to be essential to the country and our state moving forward, whatever direction it may be,” Mr. Reed said.</p>
<p>Signing onto the initiative are former Govs. Tom Corbett, Ed Rendell, Mark Schweiker, Tom Ridge and Dick Thornburgh, as well as former Pennsylvania House Speaker Dennis O’Brien. Co-chairing the committee alongside Mr. Reed is former U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, a Democrat who served as Undersecretary of the Army.</p>
<p>The coalition is operating under the assumption that November’s election won’t be typical and that there will still be lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Reed said.</p>
<p>But it also will operate at a time of stark partisan divide over the validity of vote-by-mail, amplified by President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that “Mail-In Voting, unless changed by the courts, will lead to the most CORRUPT ELECTION in our Nation’s History! #RIGGEDELECTION.”</p>
<p>Asked about the president’s tweet — which came on the same day of the coalition’s launch — Mr. Reed said the coalition will “let presidential politics play out” and that “things are going to be said” by both parties and candidates on the issue.</p>
<p>“From our perspective, we’re focused on making sure everyone feels comfortable with the opportunity to vote this fall,” Mr. Reed said. “It’s really that simple.”</p>
<p>But does the president’s rhetoric complicate their efforts to educate voters?</p>
<p>It’s “sometimes more difficult,” Mr. Reed said, “when elected officials attack different items” — but&nbsp;it can also have the effect of drawing more attention to the option of mail-in balloting, which the coalition aims to do on its own.</p>
<p>A press release announcing VoteSafe’s statewide campaign included the assertion, “Despite the many myths about voting by mail, the reality is that mail-in ballots are a safe and secure method, and do not advantage one party over the other.”</p>
<p>Mr. Reed said he doesn’t believe mail-in ballots benefit one party over another, citing the success of the absentee ballot system in Pennsylvania over many years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The success of this coalition, Mr. Reed said, will be measured by how confident voters are in the voting process and how timely election results are reported.</p>
