<h1>Steelers sign two-time Super Bowl-winning lineman Stefen Wisniewski</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Stefen Wisniewski grew up in South Fayette and attended Central Catholic High School. He went to Steelers games at Heinz Field throughout his childhood and watched them win two Super Bowls.</p>
<p>Now, in the twilight of his NFL career, it’s his mission to help the Steelers win another one before he retires.</p>
<p>Wisniewski, an interior offensive lineman who has started more than 100 games in his career, is signing a free agent contract with his hometown team. He agreed to terms on a two-year deal Thursday and will drive from his home in State College to Pittsburgh to take his physical soon.</p>
<p>“It really hasn’t sunk in yet,” Wisniewski said over the phone Thursday night. “I’ve been calling my friends and coaches. They’re all pumped.”</p>
<p>Wisniewski comes to the Steelers fresh off a Super Bowl victory as a starting guard for the Kansas City Chiefs. It was the second time in three years he raised the Lombardi trophy after winning with the Eagles following the 2017 season.</p>
<p>It was a storybook ending to a season that started with disappointment after the Eagles released him just before the start of the regular season. It looked like his NFL career might be over after eight years. No one called for the first six weeks of the season.</p>
<p>"I was just working out, hoping to get a call," he said.</p>
<p>That opportunity came when the Chiefs had several linemen go down with injuries in the middle of their season.&nbsp; They signed Wisniewski, who ended up starting the final two games of the regular season and all three playoff games, including the 31-20 victory over the 49ers in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Wisniewski said several teams, including the Chiefs, were interested in signing him this week. But when longtime Steelers left guard Ramon Foster retired on Tuesday, it got his attention. He was hoping the Steelers would call.</p>
<p>Even though he had a great experience in his only season with the Chiefs, who will be considered strong favorites to win the AFC again in 2020, he always wanted to play for the Steelers. His wife, Hilary, also hails from Pittsburgh, and his family remains in the city.</p>
<p>“The Steelers had a need,” Wisniewski said. “I was hoping they would call, and then they did. I knew it would be a great fit.”</p>
<p>The Steelers filled a big need by landing Wisniewski. Not only did Foster retire, but their top interior backup, B.J. Finney, signed with the Seahawks on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wisniewski said the Steelers told him he would have a chance to compete for the starting job at left guard.</p>
<p>“That’s my plan,” Wisniewski said. “I’ve been a starter for most of my career. I’ve started more than 100 games.”</p>
<p>He’s started 103 games, in fact. After a standout career at Penn State, Wisniewski was selected in the second round of the 2011 draft by Oakland, where he started 61 games at center and guard. He played for the Jaguars in 2015 and then for the Eagles from 2016-18. He was a starter on the 2017 Eagles team that beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>“I’ve been blessed to win two Super Bowls,” Wisniewski said. “It’s an unbelievable experience to win one. I want to do it again with my hometown team.”</p>
