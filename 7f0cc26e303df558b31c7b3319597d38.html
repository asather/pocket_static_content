<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The death of a McKees Rocks woman, whose body was found partially dismembered inside an abandoned refrigerator left in the hallway of an apartment building in May, has been ruled a homicide.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County medical examiner’s office released the ruling on Tuesday, although it said the cause of Kristy Jefferson’s death remains undetermined.</p>
<p>The body of Ms. Jefferson, 38, was found May 4 at a building in the 100 block of Helen Street in McKees Rocks. She had been reported missing days earlier. Her body was discovered when residents reported an odor coming from a refrigerator that littered a second-floor hallway.</p>
<p>County police arrested Daryl Jones, 41, and charged him with abuse of a corpse. Police confirmed that Jones lived in the building where Ms. Jefferson’s body was found.</p>
<p>According to court records, neither Jones nor anyone else has been charged with homicide.</p>
<p>“We are in consultation with the District Attorneys office concerning possible charges,” said county homicide Lt. Venerando Costa.</p>
<p>Jones is being held without bond at the Allegheny County Jail.</p>
