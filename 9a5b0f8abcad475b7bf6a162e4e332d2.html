<h1>Dispatches from the Front: NYC physician assistant from Shaler sees some ‘down’ time</h1>

<p><em>One in an occasional series.</em></p>
<p>The spread of COVID-19 in New York City is slowing, and that means fewer hours on the medical front lines there for Ross Morgan, a physician assistant from Shaler.</p>
<p>He’s now “down” to working 60 hours a week —&nbsp;six consecutive days of 10-hour shifts —&nbsp;at Metropolitan Hospital in Manhattan’s East Harlem neighborhood. At one point over the past six weeks as a temporary medical provider at the hospital, he worked 16 straight days of 12-hour shifts before getting a day off.</p>
<p>“Ten hours a day doesn’t seem a lot different than 12 hours a day, but it does make a world of difference. Those two hours make it different in how I can engage with the evening&nbsp;— showering, eating something, exercising, going to bed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan, 30, was speaking Friday evening from the Park Central Hotel in midtown Manhattan, where he and as many as 400 other physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and respiratory therapists from New York and across America have been housed as they temporarily provide additional staffing at city hospitals.</p>
<p>That number has declined as the pace of infections has dropped in New York, the country’s epicenter for the virus. Initially, Mr. Morgan was among 40 temporary medical personnel assigned to Metropolitan, but that number has declined to about 18 as the curve has flattened and those who have gone back to their homes and lives across the country and their jobs haven’t been replaced.</p>
<p>Because his workweek has declined to six days of 10-hour shifts, Mr. Morgan now has every Saturday free. What does he do with his time off? For the past two Saturdays he has provided medical care, seeing his patients at Atrium Medical PC, the primary care practice in Manhattan where he worked until it closed because of the coronavirus quarantine. Even though that means he’s again working seven days a week, Mr. Morgan said the shift he’s working Saturdays —&nbsp;9 a.m. to 2 p.m. —&nbsp;is short, and he wants to see his patients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s nice to do medicine outside of COVID and get back to what I usually do, seeing my patients again. I worry about a lot of them, about their primary care health maintenance during this time.”</p>
<p>It seems like a lifetime ago that Mr. Morgan was in the midst of COVID-19 chaos as New York City hospitals struggled to keep up with an influx of patients as the pandemic exploded in America’s largest and most densely populated city. The city had experienced more than 190,000 cases, more than 50,000 hospitalizations and more than 20,000 deaths from COVID-19, according to figures released Sunday by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.</p>
<p>For weeks Mr. Morgan was assigned to screen patients for COVID-19 in an emergency room annex at Metropolitan. Early on, he was seeing upward to 50 patients a shift. That number has since declined to a handful, so he was shifted to performing nasal swab testing for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Initially COVID-19 tests were in such short supply that they were only administered to those who were so symptomatic that they were admitted to the hospital. But now, with an influx of thousands of tests that have a turnaround of a day or two, anyone who wants to be tested —&nbsp;such as those who need a negative test to return to work —&nbsp;can get one simply by showing up at the emergency room.</p>
<p>Mr. Morgan has been performing 20-30 tests a day, but the hospital is projecting that will increase to 50-60 daily.</p>
<p>“It’s calmed down a lot. The patient volume is significantly lower,” he said. “On the inpatient end, there are still patients on ventilators, [so it’s] not like the hospital is completely back to business as usual but pretty close to it.</p>
<p>“The emergency room is back to its usual volume,” he said. “The focus on [COVID-19] inpatients, a good amount of that has passed, and we’re now focusing on outpatients in the community.”</p>
<p>The Shaler Area High School, University of Pittsburgh and Pace University graduate said he’s followed what’s been happening in Pennsylvania, and he gave health officials in his home and adopted states high marks for closing nonessential businesses, requiring masks and providing stay-at-home and social distancing guidance.</p>
<p>“What it looks like to me is they both did a pretty bang-up job,” he said. “This is what we all kind of anticipated if things went right. The numbers ended up being better than projected, and that’s largely because of those measures,” he said. “Most people took it seriously, and the results we are seeing are because of that. A very, very small minority got a lot of press [in opposing the measures].</p>
<p>“I think there’s a sense of relief. I don’t know what is to come in the future ... but I’m being optimistic. I think that our biggest wave in the city is past. I think we’re going to see some fluctuations, some spikes, going forward, but I think the worst is behind us.”</p>
