<h1>Jason Mackey's Life at Home: Keeping score and remaining a fan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The 6-year-old stared out from his room, head cocked to the side and looking a little confused. It was 5 a.m. on a random Wednesday earlier this month. His dad, baseball scorebook in hand, popped in to say hello before stumbling downstairs to start the coffee.</p>
<p>“Hey dad,” the kid said. “What are you doing up?”</p>
<p>Good question, although this sight would hardly qualify as strange if you knew his father. It’s also an interesting story, one we’ll work through inning by inning.</p>
<p><strong>First inning:</strong> Badly missing baseball — and live sports — many in the United States have turned their lonely eyes to the Korea Baseball Organization, adopting a team and waking up early to catch its <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/05/04/how-to-watch-KBO-baseball-ESPN-what-you-need-to-know/stories/202005040085" target="_blank">broadcasts live on ESPN</a>.</p>
<p>It’s been that way in our house since opening day for the 10-team league on May 5. We’ve adopted the NC Dinos because of their killer mascot and the preseason buzz surrounding the up-and-coming squad. The Dinos have done their part by winning 12 of their first 14 games and putting up some impressive offensive numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Second inning:</strong> Outside of seeing my family, sending the kids somewhere safe for a couple hours and dates with my wife, one of the things I miss most about normal life is baseball.</p>
<p>Live action. Rallies. Solid pitching. Comebacks. Strategy. Great defensive plays. All of it.</p>
<p>I also miss keeping score. Yes, the meticulous act of writing things down, recording the entire game in baseball shorthand.</p>
<p><strong>Third inning:</strong> When the Pirates are playing, I obsess over this stuff. I use one scorebook for the year and the same type of pen. (I tried a different one Aug. 21 against the Washington Nationals, and the mismatched ink still irks me.) I note every lineup change and record every pitching line, totaling what batters do as I go.</p>
<p>If I miss something in the later innings because I was hacking away on deadline, I go back later that night or the next morning and catch up. In addition to the line score, I write down the date, ballpark, time of first pitch, game-time temperature, umpires, time of game and attendance.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth inning:</strong> I’m not sure where this ritual I love so much came from, although I have a few guesses.</p>
<p>When he was alive, my dad wrote down daily tasks on an index card he’d keep with him. I never thought much of it until one of his best friends brought it up at his wake, joking how a few in their group used to make fun of him for it. My wife keeps the tradition alive by giving me grief for writing down daily tasks in a notebook that I keep with me at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth inning:</strong> Keeping score does something for me, I know that.</p>
<p>When I worked for The Washington Post, we had a system for high school box scores called “Boxer.” Get a roster, schedule or stats from a game, you had certain formatting commands, then it posted to the high school sports site in a readable way.</p>
<p>I used to joke with one of my colleagues there, Matt Brooks (now a food editor), about how it satisfied our OCD quotient — making things neat and orderly in a relatively mindless and painless way.</p>
<p><strong>Sixth inning:</strong> Keeping score was a big part of my summer job while living in D.C. — working for the Nationals.</p>
<p>During home games, I’d keep stats for the production crew and spot for the public-address announcer. My position wasn’t necessary, but the PA guy (Jerome Hruska) was/is a good friend and it netted a single guy in his 20s $100/game and dinner — gold for someone allergic to cooking.</p>
<p>Plus, I accumulated stacks and stacks of scorecards, which I had saved until a few years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Seventh inning:</strong> Seeing your father with a scorebook at 5 a.m. should be an odd occurrence, but in our house, it’s really not. After a short explanation, my son came downstairs and, for a few seconds, seemed to care.</p>
<p>My older son isn’t a huge sports fan, so I explained to him that, for me, keeping a scorebook is the same as lightsabers, building Legos or playing with robots — it makes me happy.</p>
<p><strong>Eighth inning:</strong> It also makes me tired.</p>
<p>Maybe for you, getting up at 5 a.m. is routine. For someone who covers professional sports for a living, it’s definitely not.</p>
<p>Working at night — essentially second shift — means I usually sleep later than my wife and kids. Between writing on deadline, any additional research or web stories and eventually getting my brain to calm down, I’m lucky to be in bed by 1 or 2 a.m. after a game.</p>
<p><strong>Ninth inning:</strong> Watching the KBO has also reminded me of something important in this business: to be a fan of <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>Too many times in sports journalism, we get jaded. We lose our grasp on reality and forget what it’s like to be a fan. We must be objective and can’t cheer in the press box, but that doesn’t mean we should be inhuman or ignorant of how our audience thinks.</p>
<p>I’m thankful the Dinos have reminded me of that.</p>
