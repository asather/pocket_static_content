<h1>Pets of the week: Celebrate St. Pitty's Day with Molly, Baby Meows</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Her name isn’t Molly Maguire, but this girl is ready to spend St. Paddy’s Day in a home.</p>
<p>Molly is a 5-year-old pittie mix who came to the shelter due to landlord issues. Molly puts all stereotypes about pitbulls to shame. She is the sweetest most cuddly pup who wants to spend as much time as she can around people. Her previous owners say that she was great with kids, and she was very into other dogs that she met at the shelter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Molly hates it in the shelter. She has extreme stress in her kennel which is causing her to become depressed and destructive. Molly spends most of her days being an office dog here, and happily naps or peacefully chews on toys. A foster or adoptive home would be lifesaving for Molly.</p>
<p>Another boy who wants to cuddle with his owner is Baby Meows. Sure, Baby Meows may have the silliest name, but also has one of the most reserved personalities. Baby Meows is a 1-year-old long-haired male cat who spends most of his days in hiding. While Baby Meows has started to make progress, he is not thriving in his cage. He has such a long life ahead of him, and we would love to see his true personality begin to shine. Baby Meows would do best in a quiet home without kids or dogs. Once again, a foster or forever home would truly save Baby Meow’s life.</p>
<p>If you’d like to adopt, or be a foster (which is the most rewarding thing you can do!), stop by the Women’s Animal Center, 3839 Richlieu Road in Bensalem, or visit the website womensanimalcenter.org.</p>
