<h1>Texas company licenses University of Pittsburgh gene therapy that could cure diabetes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh researcher is crediting a new, supportive environment for entrepreneurs at the University of Pittsburgh for making it possible to license a technology that may one day cure diabetes.</p>
<p>Diabetes researcher and pediatric surgeon George K. Gittes has patented a gene therapy technology that restored normal glucose levels in the blood of mice by reprogramming beta cells in the pancreas. The results were detailed in a study published last year in the scientific journal Cell Stem Cell.</p>
<p>Austin, Texas-based Genprex Inc. signed an exclusive license for the technology from Pitt on Feb. 11 with plans to partner in the development and commercialization of the therapy for humans. Exclusivity gives Genprex sole authority to develop and commercialize the technology.</p>
<p>“The landscape at Pitt over the past several years has really improved, making innovation advancements of this type possible,” said Dr. Gittes, 58. “The Innovation Institute was really helpful.”</p>
<p>Pitt formed the Innovation Institute in 2013 to provide help in protecting intellectual property and commercialization of discoveries by university faculty and staff. Anticipating an increase in life science startup companies since then, more than 700,000 square feet of commercial laboratory space, where entrepreneurs and scientists can work side by side, is being developed in Oakland and Bloomfield.</p>
<p>Restoration of blood glucose levels in mice lasted about four months, which could translate into decades in humans, Dr. Gittes said. Testing in humans could begin in a year.</p>
<p>The gene therapy could eliminate the need for insulin replacement for people with diabetes, which is the first advancement in diabetes care since insulin was discovered in 1921, Dr. Gittes said.</p>
<p>Diabetes affects some 30.3 million people in the United States, or 9% of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>“We are excited to announce the licensing agreement with the University of Pittsburgh and we look forward to working with Dr. Gittes and his team to develop this groundbreaking treatment for diabetes,” Genprex chairman and CEO Rodney Varner said in a prepared statement. “The diabetes gene therapy could hold the potential to provide long-term effectiveness, or even be a cure, for diabetes patients.”</p>
