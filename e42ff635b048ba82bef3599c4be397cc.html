<p>LAS VEGAS — Roger Mayweather, a former world champion who also trained his nephew Floyd Mayweather Jr., has died at the age of 58.</p>
<p>Floyd Mayweather announced the death in a statement on Tuesday. Roger Mayweather had been ill with diabetes and other long-term health issues.</p>
<p>“My uncle was one of the most important people in my life inside and outside of the ring,” Floyd Mayweather said. “Roger was a great champion and one of the best trainers in boxing. Unfortunately, his health was failing him for several years and now he can finally rest in peace. Roger meant the world to me, my father Floyd Sr., my uncle Jeff, our whole family, everyone in and around the Mayweather Boxing Gym and the entire boxing world.”</p>
<p>He was in the corner for some of Floyd Jr.’s biggest fights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mayweather, whose nickname was the “Black Mamba,” held titles at 130 and 140 pounds in a pro career that spanned 72 fights. A native of Grand Rapids, Mich., he fought such names as Julio Cesar Chavez and Pernell Whitaker and was 59-13 with 35 knockouts in an 18-year career that began in 1981.</p>
<p>He won world championships in the super featherweight, light welterweight and welterweight divisions, and his final title win came on March 12, 1997, against Carlos Miranda for the IBA welterweight title in Grand Rapids.</p>
<p>Roger was the most successful slugger among his siblings. Brother Jeff was 32-10-5 from 1988 to 1997, and Floyd Sr. was 28-6-1 from 1974 to 1990.</p>
<p>Mayweather was a colorful figure in the boxing world, gaining more notoriety&nbsp;as a trainer for his nephew. When Floyd Sr. was in prison, Roger partly put his career on pause and helped guide Floyd Jr.'s pro career from 1996 to 1998. After Floyd Jr. fired Floyd Sr. as his trainer, Roger resumed duties and directed Floyd Jr. as head trainer in 2000</p>
<p>Never short on opinions on boxing or his nephew, Mayweather made headlines as the cornerman for Floyd Jr.'s fight against Zab Judah in Las Vegas in 2006. An intentional low blow from Judah incensed Roger, who climbed into the ring during the match to confront him.</p>
<p>A melee ensued and Roger was ejected from ringside. He was fined $200,000 by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and suspended for a year.</p>
<p>With Roger often in his corner, Floyd Jr. ran up a 49-0 lifetime record before hanging-up the gloves in 2015. Floyd Jr. came back in 2017 for a non-title bout against MMA fighter Conor McGregor. That became win number 50.</p>
<p>Roger is the second loved one Floyd Jr., 43, lost this month. Last week, Josie Harris, the mother of three of Floyd Jr.’s children, was found dead in her car in front of her house in Valencia, Calif.</p>
