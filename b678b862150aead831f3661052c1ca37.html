<p>Kaniya Martin,18, of the North Side&nbsp;and Atiya Rosser, 20, of Sheraden, had their preliminary hearings continued to March 25.&nbsp;Alicia Johnson,&nbsp;19, of Wilkinsburg&nbsp;and Sharondia Lett,&nbsp;19, of East Allegheny, both on Monday waived their hearings to trial.</p>
<p>All&nbsp;are charged with simple assault.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police said the women attacked Billie Jo Goldsworthy and her boyfriend, 62-year-old Mark Conn, around 10:15 pm. on Nov. 4 outside the McDonald’s in the 600 block of Wood Street.</p>

Police said she delivered a blow to Mr. Conn, of the South Hills, that knocked him out and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/12/18/mcdonalds-downtown-pittsburgh-assault-man-paralyzed-lawsuit/stories/201912180152" target="_blank">resulted in him being paralyzed with a spinal injury</a>. She has a jury trial set for April, court records show.</p>
<p>A criminal complaint said the couple got into an argument inside the McDonald’s with several employees. The dispute, which spilled into the street, was captured on video by cellphone and a McDonald’s surveillance camera.</p>

<p>Ms. Martin and Ms. Lett, both McDonald’s employees, punched Ms. Goldsworthy as she sat on the ground, the complaint said. Both were still on duty and supposed to be working at the time, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Police said video showed that Ms. Johnson intervened as Ms. Goldsworthy and Ms. Davis yelled at each other outside the restaurant. As Ms. Goldsworthy tried to get back inside McDonald’s to get her belongings and her small service dog, which was inside a travel case, Ms. Johnson removed her jacket and adopted a “fighting stance,” the complaint said.</p>
<p>Ms. Rosser, who is friends with Ms. Davis, pushed Ms. Goldsworthy and then sprayed the victim in her face with either pepper spray or Mace, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Ms. Johnson grabbed Ms. Goldsworthy by the hair and yanked her to the ground, causing her head to slam into the sidewalk, the complaint said.</p>
