<h1>A look at Day 4 witnesses in the Wilkinsburg mass slaying trial</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This is a running list of witnesses called each day during the trial of Cheron Shelton, 33, of Lincoln-Lemington, who is accused of killing five people and an unborn child on March 9, 2016, at a backyard barbecue on Franklin Avenue in Wilkinsburg.</p>
<p>The victims: Siblings Jerry Michael Shelton, 35, Brittany Powell, 27, and Chanetta Powell, 25, who was eight months pregnant; and their cousins Tina Shelton, 37, and Shada Mahone, 26.</p>
<p><strong>Day 4, Feb. 6, 2020</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Matt Rosenberg, Allegheny County police, on the stand for 6 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg is a mobile device computer forensic examiner who described the process of downloading information from a person’s cell phone and how that data is then converted into a PDF document.</p>
<p><strong>2. Allegheny County police Detective Tom Foley, on the stand for 13 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Det. Foley, with the county’s homicide unit, testified that he interviewed Cheron Shelton’s sister, Ashley Smith, on March 12, 2016, and obtained permission from her to download the contacts of her phone.</p>
<p>As part of his testimony, he linked a contact in her phone to the number police have said Shelton was using at the time on the shooting.</p>
<p><strong>3. Allegheny County police Sgt. Todd Dolfi, on the stand for 14 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Sgt. Dolfi, with the county’s homicide unit, interviewed Shelton’s other sister, Brittany Shelton, on March 12, 2016.</p>
<p>Sgt. Dolfi linked Brittany Shelton’s cell phone to her brother’s, and also showed that she had a message in her phone from Robert Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>4. Allegheny County Detective Steve Hitchings, on the stand for 10 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Det. Hitchings, with the county’s homicide unit, testified that he interviewed Shelton’s girlfriend, Channel Falls, during the investigation.</p>
<p>He, too, linked her phone number to Shelton, who she had listed in her phone as “Babycakes.”</p>
<p>Among the messages recovered in Ms. Falls’ phone was one she sent to Shelton at 10:41 p.m. on March 9, 2016 -- 13 minutes before the shooting, in which she wrote, “SMH [shaking my head]. I already see where this is going. Just gonna keep calm and watch you lose everything before your very eyes.”</p>
<p>Ms. Falls and Shelton called and texted each other throughout that night, with the last message at 3:42 a.m. in which she wrote, “Yo, let’s go. I’m getting tired. I gotta work in the morning.”</p>
<p><strong>5. Channel Falls, Cheron Shelton’s girlfriend, on the stand for 22 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Ms. Falls testified that she and Shelton were with their sons and at his mother’s house during the day on March 9, 2016. He took her and their boys home about 8 p.m. and was supposed to go and pick up hamburger buns.</p>
<p>Instead, she said, he didn’t return home until after 3 a.m. and when he did, he was wearing different clothes.</p>
<p>He told her he’d thrown up on himself, Ms. Falls said.</p>
<p>She told the jury she tried to contact Shelton four or five times that night, and when he finally got home, she met him outside and drove him to his mother’s house. Ms. Falls said she was mad at him.</p>
<p>She claimed her message from earlier that evening to him was because “he wasn’t taking our relationship seriously.”</p>
<p>On cross-examination, Ms. Falls said she would not lie under oath for Shelton. The two of them have been together, on and off, for 11 or 12 years, she said.</p>
<p>The day of the shooting, she testified, he had just gotten out of jail after about a month.</p>
<p>Ms. Falls said Shelton never held a real job and instead sold drugs, although shortly before the shooting, he had enrolled in technical school.</p>
<p><strong>6. Desdrene Smith, Shelton’s mother, on the stand for 5 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Ms. Smith testified that she owned two vehicles at the time of the shooting, including a four-door white Lincoln.</p>
<p>She told the jury that her son had access to both her house and car and did not have to ask permission to use them.</p>
<p>Relative to a weapon found in her home, as well as ammunition for an assault-style rifle, Ms. Smith said, “they could’ve been anybody’s because my daughter was licensed to carry.”</p>
<p><strong>7. Brittany Shelton, Shelton’s sister, on the stand for 6 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>She testified that her brother had access to the Lincoln she owned with her mother.</p>
<p><strong>8. Scott Towne, former Allegheny County police homicide detective, on the stand for 13 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Towne testified that the phones police said belonged to Shelton and Thomas at the time of the shooting, called each other 33 times the night of the shooting, beginning at 8:04 p.m. and ending at 12:15 a.m.</p>
<p>There were no calls between 10:46 p.m. and 10:56 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>9. Allegheny County police Detective Pat Miller, on the stand for 5 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Det. Miller testified about the phone records belonging to Thomas,</p>
<p><strong>10. Thomas Morgan, Allegheny County crime lab firearms examiner, on the stand for 14 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Morgan testified about the velocity of bullets fired from a .40-caliber handgun and an assault-style rifle firing 7.62x39 bullets.</p>
<p>The .40-caliber, he said, typically travels at about 1,000 feet per second. The bullets from an assault-style rifle travel more than twice that fast.</p>
