<h1>Coroner says Beaver County COVID-19 deaths now at 13</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The number of people who died in Beaver County from COVID-19 more than doubled over this past weekend from six to 13, the county’s coroner said Tuesday.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty frightening right now,” said Beaver County Coroner David Gabauer, who also owns Gabauer Funeral Home in New Brighton.</p>
<p>Mr. Gabauer would not say where the deaths have occurred.</p>
<p>“It’s not fair to the families, it’s not fair to the businesses” to say where the deaths occurred, Mr. Gabauer said.</p>
<p>The figure he provided is more than double the number of COVID-19-related deaths — six — that the Pennsylvania Department of Health reported for the county on Monday. Later Tuesday, the state updated the number of deaths in Beaver County to nine.</p>
<p>Mr. Gabauer said the state’s lower figure may be because the state was not updating the number of deaths over the weekend like it was the number of positive cases that are sent electronically to a system the state manages.</p>
<p>“The state doesn’t work on the weekends, but I do,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gabauer would not say if any of the additional death cases occurred at the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center. It has has previously reported five.</p>
<p>He said that he is confident that both his office and the healthcare system is prepared for a surge in cases.</p>
<p>Beaver County has long had a “mass fatality plan” in place, he said, that dates back decades to when the plan revolved around a catastrophic, one-time event like the crash of USAir flight 427 in 1994 that killed 132 people in Beaver County.</p>
<p>But seeing what was happening with COVID-19 deaths in other regions of the country a month ago, Mr. Gabauer said his office amended that plan to deal with a more sustained surge in deaths in his county.</p>
<p>He said he did not want to release details of what that plan entails for fear of frightening residents.</p>
<p>“I hope and pray I don’t ever have to use it,” he said.</p>
