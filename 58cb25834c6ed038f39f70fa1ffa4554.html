<h1>The 'Burgh's best dishes and drinks right now</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Here, found and devoured by our intrepid staffers across the city and the region, are this week’s #BBDD — ’Burgh’s best dishes and drinks right now.</p>
<p><strong>Austin’s Big Cookie at Bigham Tavern, Mount Washington</strong></p>
<p>I go to Bigham Tavern for wings, which are among the city’s best, and reliably good pub grub. Those reasons both held true on Friday night, when — even though I don’t have much of a sweet tooth — I couldn’t pass up dessert in the form of “Austin’s Big Cookie.”</p>
<p>The former "Big Cookie" dessert special was renamed to honor a 22-year-old employee Austin Fike Sr., who was struck and killed by an unlicensed driver in Brookline in October. The restaurant donates $1 from every cookie sold to a fund for Mr. Fike’s 2-year-old son, Austin Jr.</p>
<p>The warm, gooey and freshly baked jumbo chocolate chip cookie ($4) seems to be the size of a manhole cover and is flecked with powdered sugar and drizzled with warm chocolate sauce, and is typically topped with whipped cream (that I eschewed). It was Mr. Fike’s favorite dessert at this restaurant where he worked as a prep cook and dishwasher. It is easy to see why.</p>

<p><strong>Pho noodle soup at Shaka in Federal Galley, North Side&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I’m a proud member of the #saddesklunch crowd who feels no shame eating lunch out of the office vending machine. But last Monday was my birthday, and so my husband whisked me out of the building for a “real” lunch. Our late-afternoon meal at Shaka, a restaurant serving Hawaiian-fusion cuisine at Federal Galley, was indeed celebratory. He chose the salmon poke bowl ($16), which pairs a heap of the tender smoked fish with steamed rice and mixed greens as well as kimchi, chickpeas, onion and crispy strips of julienned nori. I couldn't resist a bowl of steaming pho ($15). The flavorful grass-fed beef broth is swimming with rice noodles, cilantro, sliced jalapeno and a generous mound of bean sprouts and is drizzled with sriracha for a spicy finishing touch. Opt for the grilled huli huli chicken for your protein. Redolent of brown sugar, ginger and soy sauce, it’s a sticky-sweet taste of Hawaii.</p>

<p><strong>Al pastor tacos at Asadero by Mindful Brewing Co., Scott</strong></p>
<p>Last week I reported that 99 Bottles in Scott near Carnegie was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/dining/2020/01/22/Carnegie-99-Bottles-reopening-Asadero-Mindful-Brewing-Mexican-tacos-beer/stories/202001200107" target="_blank">reopening as a second location of Castle Shannon’s Mindful Brewing Co.</a> with a independent kitchen inside called Asadero. It’s the first eatery by Upper St. Clair’s&nbsp;Jazmine Castillo and her family, who became friends with the folks who own Mindful. The order-at-the-counter a la carte menu is short and sweet, with a half dozen starters, eight tacos, a burrito, three kids menu items and two desserts.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmindfulbrewing%2Fposts%2F2503014406474775&amp;width=500" style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media" width="500" height="356" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Word before Monday’s opening that the al pastor is to die for, so I took my family that first night to try those tacos filled with marinated pork, onions, cilantro and grilled pineapple with tomatillo salsa&nbsp;($4). They were indeed really good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So was my wife’s tomatillo soup ($5.5).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So were the super-cute tiny chicken&nbsp;“street tacos” on the&nbsp;“Kiddos” menu, served with rice ($5), all of which was hooved down by my 12-year-old, who clearly is too old for the kids menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ordered another round of drinks (Lambda IPA, Coke, Barefoot Sauvignon Blanc) and another round of food (kids street tacos with rice, asada taco in corn for $4.50, asado taco in lettuce for $4.50) and had a very enjoyable meal, but it was a lesson in our ongoing talks about finances with the kid, as -— with the drinks and the extra food — our bill came to $63.66, more than you might expect with such a menu.</p>
<p>But it’s a good&nbsp;and different one for a brewpub and we didn’t have to go outside to pick up from a food truck. That said, it could be warmer in this former Pizza Hut. When one of the guys serving your food is wearing a coat, hat and scarf, that’s not a good sign, and that might have contributed to the food not being as piping hot as I like it.</p>
<p>But I like it. Asadero by Mindful is off to a good start. We’ll be back to try the $5 Pittsburgh Taco (with fries on it, of course) and the $4 Chocoflan, “chocolate cake stacked with creamy vanilla flan and dripping with caramel.”&nbsp;</p>
