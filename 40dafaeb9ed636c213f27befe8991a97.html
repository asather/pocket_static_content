<h1>Tweet from Rep. Lamb’s brother spurs back-and-forth between congressman’s campaign, Parnell</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A late-night tweet from the brother of U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb this past weekend has become the subject of an accusatory back-and-forth between the congressman’s campaign and that of his Republican electoral opponent, Sean Parnell — who’s interpreting the tweet as advocating for his death.</p>
<p>Taken on its own, the tweet by Coleman Lamb — the representative’s brother and a staffer on the payroll of his campaign — is a response to another Twitter user who wrote, "Burn in hell and die," with Coleman quoting the message and adding the words, "Can add [Sean Parnell] here," tagging the 17th district Republican nominee in the tweet.</p>
<p>Mr. Parnell deemed it "distasteful and hateful rhetoric that has no place in political discourse," asserting that "it is disappointing that Conor Lamb’s brother, a leader in his campaign, would stoop so low as to call for the death of a political opponent."</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb’s campaign manager, Abby Nassif-Murphy, insisted that the tweet — however "intemperate" — was misconstrued and actually in response to "vile tweets" from Republicans who were attacking the late Rep. John Lewis in the hours after his death Friday.</p>
<p>Though Coleman Lamb’s tweets are still up on Twitter, many of the tweets from other users that preceded it — and that the campaign claims would provide better context — have since been deleted.</p>
<p>Screenshots from Twitter’s cache, however, reveal a late-night exchange between Coleman and two other users on Twitter that indeed started with a message about Mr. Lewis, the late congressman.</p>
<p>None of the tweets, though, can definitively settle the battle over interpretation.</p>
<p>At 11:45 p.m. on Friday, a Twitter user named Sean Strnad posted a message about Mr. Lewis, writing that the late congressman "deserved to see [Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders nominated for the Democratic presidential ticket."</p>
<p>"But as a sellout, [Mr. Lewis] endorsed Joe Biden. So now, well, he’s not going to miss out on too much, unfortunately," the user, Sean Strnad, wrote.</p>
<p>Nearly an hour later, Coleman Lamb responded to the message and said, "You are literally a clown. You deserve nothing," then followed up five minutes later by quoting it and saying, "This is the Trump/[Sean Strnad] campaign."</p>
<p>A user named Dave responded to Sean Strnad as well, writing, "Burn in hell and die."</p>
<p>Coleman Lamb quoted Dave's tweet, eight minutes later, and added, "Can add [Sean Parnell] here." Dave, meanwhile, wrote that his "burn in hell and die" message was for Sean Strnad, and not for the late Congressman Lewis.</p>
<p>Ms. Nassif-Murphy, for the Lamb campaign, said Coleman Lamb "did not threaten anyone," but tagged Mr. Parnell's account "while responding to vile tweets from the Republicans attacking John Lewis in the hours after his death."</p>
<p>"It was intemperate and [Coleman] should've realized how it could be misconstrued," Ms. Nassif-Murphy said.</p>
<p>Mr. Parnell, who interpreted the message as advocating for his death, said, “In the spirit of today’s cancel culture, one would expect calls for Coleman Lamb’s immediate dismissal. However, I believe that everyone needs a little grace from time to time."</p>
<p>"As despicable as Coleman Lamb’s comments are, everyone makes mistakes, and I hope that Coleman Lamb, Conor Lamb, and their campaign team can learn from it," Mr. Parnell said.</p>
<p>The tweet spread quickly through conservative media circles and the accounts of pundits and GOP politicians — as well as several of Mr. Lamb's self-proclaimed 17th district constituents — over the remainder of the weekend, with the National Republican Congressional Committee chiming in and saying, "DIsgusted by [Conor Lamb's] campaign wishing death on decorated combat veteran [Sean Parnell]? Donate today!"</p>
<p>Ms. Nassif-Murphy, in her statement, said Mr. Parnell, his supporters and "the paid trolls in the national Republican party say all kinds of things about us on Twitter," adding that "we don't complain and the media doesn't cover it — nor should they."</p>
<p>"We think everyone from the President on down to Conor's brother should think more, tweet less, and be nicer to each other," Ms. Nassif-Murphy said.</p>
