<h1>New Zealand street once again the world's steepest after Guinness World Records reverses decision</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A street in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/destinations/new-zealand" target="_blank">New Zealand</a> just got its title back after the Guinness World Records organization changed the way it measures these things.</p>
<p>Baldwin Street, in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/things-to-do-dunedin-new-zealand/index.html" target="_blank">Dunedin, New Zealand</a>, held the record for over a decade until June 2019. That's when Ffordd Pen Llech, a winding street in Harlech, Wales, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/welsh-town-world-steepest-street-intl-scli/index.html" target="_blank">swiped the title</a>.</p>
<p>Representatives of Baldwin Street appealed the decision saying the street was measured inaccurately.</p>
<p>After reviewing the appeal, Guiness World Records agreed and said "in order to fairly assess the different shape of the streets, whether they're straight or curved, steepness must be measured by the central axis," which is the center of the road.</p>
<p>The new results said Baldwin Street has the steeper gradient of 34.8%, compared to Ffordd Pen Llech's gradient of 28.6%.</p>
<p>"Sincere thanks to Guinness World Records for considering our findings," Toby Stoff, one of Baldwin Street's representatives said in an online statement. "It is important to know that Guinness World Records treats matters like this in a robust and professional manner. The issue of gradient was technical in nature only."</p>
<p>The title of steepest street is hotly contested. The World Atlas gives the accolade to Canton Avenue in Pittsburgh, but it is the Guinness World Records title that is the most prized. The road, located in Beechview, is measured at 37% grade.</p>
<p>"We're very grateful to the Baldwin Street appeals team, led by surveyor Toby Stoff, for making us aware of a rare gap in our stipulations, and we're pleased to see the title return to New Zealand," Craig Glenday, editor-in-chief at Guinness World Records, said in an online statement.</p>
