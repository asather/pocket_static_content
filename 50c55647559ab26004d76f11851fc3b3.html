<h1>Kraft Heinz products gobbled up in pandemic times, but writedowns continue and future uncertain</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Shares of Kraft Heinz Co. slid more than 3% on Thursday after the food giant reported a net quarterly loss of $1.65 billion, driven mainly by a $2.9 billion non-cash writedown on the value of some of its iconic brands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, company officials noted that the shift in food spending and eating habits driven by COVID-19-related shutdowns forcing people to stay home drove strong quarterly sales and put&nbsp;Kraft Heinz products into more households.</p>
<p>Net sales rose almost 4% to $6.65 billion in the three months ended June 27, according to the company co-headquartered in Chicago and Pittsburgh. Net sales in the U.S. segment of the business alone were up 8.5%.</p>
<p>The question for investors may be what happens going forward and whether interest in products like Heinz ketchup and Kraft macaroni and cheese will ebb once the initial crush of the pandemic begins to ease.</p>
<p>“If demands remain extraordinarily strong, growth should be fine,” Carlos Abrams-Rivera, president of the company’s U.S. Zone, told analysts on a call to discuss earnings Thursday. “But [market] share is likely to be challenging in certain categories.”</p>
<p>He noted company officials are closely tracking economists’ projections for how the economy might perform and trying to be ready for everything from a sharp rebound to a bumpy ride. “From our consumption perspective, we are preparing for all the economic letters —&nbsp;the V, the U the W, etc.”</p>
<p>Before the pandemic hit, Kraft Heinz had struggled to boost sales for many of its well-known brands, as consumption trends were moving away from pre-packaged goods and shelf staples. Last year, it also took massive write-downs on the value of some brands.</p>
<p>In recent months, Mr. Abrams-Rivera said 75% of the company’s brands are gaining household penetration and 75% of new buyers have become repeat customers&nbsp;since the pandemic started.</p>
<p>“One area that will be in focus is around bigger bolder investments in innovation and new products,” wrote Scott Muskin and Matt Siler, analysts with R5 Capital in New Canaan, Connecticut, who have a hold recommendation on the stock.</p>
<p>They added, “With consumers remaining focused on healthier, less processed foods, Kraft clearly has a steep hill to climb given its portfolio. In sum, the equity price appears to be reflecting the relatively healthy near-term business offset by the uncertainty around future growth ....”</p>
<p>Kraft Heinz shares closed Thursday at $34.39.</p>
