<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump vowed to stand with anti-abortion activists Friday as he became the first sitting president to speak at the March for Life, an annual gathering that is one of the movement’s highest profile and most symbolic events.</p>
<p>“Today as president of the United States, I am truly proud to stand with you,” he told a crowd of thousands braving the cold on the National Mall. “Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.”</p>
<p>It was just four years ago when a political committee supporting one of Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals unveiled an ad slamming his views on abortion, complete with footage from a 1999 interview in which he declared, “I am pro-choice in every respect.”</p>
<p>But on Friday, Mr. Trump was hailed in speeches and on signs as “the most pro-life” American president ever.</p>
<p>The reception was yet another sign of his remarkable political transformation and the fact that white evangelical and conservative Christians remain among Mr. Trump’s most loyal backers. And the appearance made clear that, as he heads into the 2020 election, Mr. Trump is counting on those voters to help bring him across the finish line.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a brilliant move,” said Ralph Reed, chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent evangelical supporters, of Mr. Trump’s decision to become the first president to take the event’s stage.</p>
<p>It also shows how much times have changed.</p>
<p>Past presidents who opposed abortion, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, steered clear of personally attending the march to avoid being too closely associated with demonstrators eager to outlaw the procedure.</p>
<p>“President Trump has done more for the pro-life community than any other president, so it is fitting that he would be the first president in history to attend the March for Life on the National Mall,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere.</p>
<p>On Friday, his administration took another step, threatening California with the potential loss of federal health care funding over the state’s requirement that insurance plans cover abortions. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s campaign announced the creation of a new campaign coalition, “Pro-life Voices for Trump.”</p>
<p>March attendees began streaming onto the Mall early Friday morning, many holding signs with slogans like “MAKE UNBORN BABIES GREAT AGAIN!” and I VOTE PRO-LIFE FIRST.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump used his speech, in part, to attack Democrats for embracing what he labeled “radical and extreme positions” on abortion, and praised attendees, saying they were motivated by “pure, unselfish love.” Vice President Mike Pence, who was traveling in Italy on Friday, also appeared via video recorded at the Vatican following a meeting with Pope Francis.</p>
<p>The full embrace underscored Mr. Trump’s dramatic evolution on the issue of abortion from his days as a freewheeling New York deal-maker, when he described himself as “very pro-choice” in a 1999 interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”</p>
<p>By 2016, Mr. Trump said his views had changed and he was now opposed to abortion except in the case of rape and incest and when the life of the mother is at risk.</p>
