<h1>JuJu Smith-Schuster lends his likeness to a cereal that comes with a sweet deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If he doesn’t get crunched on the football field, JuJu Smith-Schuster is hoping to do so at the breakfast table.</p>
<p>Smith-Schuster, a Steelers wide receiver, will be featured in a breakfast cereal called “Jumpin’ JuJu’s Crunch.”</p>
<p>The cereal will be available at Giant Eagle and Market District locations in the Pittsburgh area beginning Saturday, according to a release.</p>
<p>The cereal, which the box claims to be “sweetened corn and oat,” comes with an even sweeter aftertaste.</p>
<p>All proceeds from the sales — 100% of them, according to the release — will go toward the JuJu Foundation. According to its website, the foundation “is a non-profit organization dedicated to the support of youth initiatives and lifting the spirits of those in need.”</p>
<p>The cereal was developed in partnership with PLB Sports and Entertainment.</p>
<p>“JuJu Smith-Schuster is a superstar both on and off the field,” said Ty Ballou, PLBSE’s CEO, in the release. “When he is not setting records on the field, he is putting up huge numbers and making a positive impact through the JuJu Foundation.</p>
<p>“We need more Jumpin’ JuJu’s in this league and in the world these days.”</p>
