<html><head><title>Energy Transfer given $30M penalty for  Beaver County pipeline explosion</title></head><body><p>The early morning landslide and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2018/09/10/gas-explosion-in-center-township-Beaver-County/stories/201809100067" target="_blank">pipeline explosion</a> that lit up a Beaver County neighborhood in September 2018 has yielded a $30.6 million penalty for the pipeline owner, Energy Transfer Corp.</p><p>Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection has signed an agreement with the Texas-based company that also allows Energy Transfer to resume getting environmental permits.</p><p>The DEP had stopped issuing new permits in February — effectively holding up several big pipeline projects — because the company kept violating environmental rules while trying to stabilize soil around the ruptured Revolution pipeline and along the right of way for its major Mariner East natural gas liquids pipelines.</p><p>The parallel Mariner East pipelines stretch across the southern part of Pennsylvania, bringing Marcellus and Utica shale gas to terminals near Philadelphia. Problems with underground drilling in the construction of the parallel pipes — a number of sinkholes in the eastern part of the state mobilized the attention of residents and lawmakers there —&nbsp;have already garnered more than $12 million in civil penalties for Energy Transfer.</p><p>While those pipelines are close to completion, there are a few sites that were still in flux when the permit ban was enacted. Now, DEP will resume evaluating the plans for those sites.</p><p>The settlement announced Friday means the company can also begin the process of repairing the Revolution pipeline, which links shale wells in Beaver and Butler counties to an Energy Transfer gas processing plant in Washington County.</p><p>The Revolution pipeline was activated just days prior to the 2018 landslide and explosion. Its two major customers are embroiled in lawsuits with Energy Transfer, including one company that has filed for bankruptcy because of the explosion.</p><p>Environmental regulators have been investigating the conduct of Energy Transfer and its contractors since the Revolution pipeline ruptured and have indicated that poor construction and oversight practices led to the disaster. (Pennsylvania’s Attorney General Josh Shapiro also has opened an investigation into the Revolution pipeline.)</p><p>For example, while the company knew as early as January 2016 that the explosion site had a “high susceptibility to slope failure,” it did not provide the report with this information to the engineers who submitted Energy Transfer’s pipeline permits.</p><p>During construction, what would later become known as the explosion site was a problem months before the line was activated.</p><p>In April 2018, according to an internal company report cited in DEP’s agreement, a landslide pushed soil off the right of way. An employee wrote that “there is a significant and very steep drop off on the edge of the ditch-line which will make it difficult to restore properly.”</p><p>But Energy Transfer did not consult an engineer or geotechnical expert on how to stabilize the ground there. Instead, the crew on site dried out the drenched soil and moved it back uphill, installing underdrains without a permit.</p><p>It was that fill —&nbsp;the soil that was placed there by the company — that slid and caused Revolution to rupture, according to a February 2019 <a href="http://files.dep.state.pa.us/ProgramIntegration/PA%20Pipeline%20Portal/RevolutionPipeline/Compliance%20and%20Enforcement%20Information/February%2025,%202019/Vol2_LandslideHazardPlan.pdf" target="_blank">consultant’s report</a> commissioned by Energy Transfer.&nbsp;</p><p>In mid-December, DEP allowed Energy Transfer to begin boring into the ground at points along the pipeline right of way, in part to establish where the pipeline is cushioned in bedrock or other dense rock or soil.</p><p>The civil penalty negotiated for the Revolution explosion appears to be the highest that an oil and gas project has ever garnered in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Of that $30.6 million sum, $28.6 million will go into DEP’s oil and gas program fund and its clean water fund. The remaining $2 million will be allocated to a community environmental project that Energy Transfer will submit to the state department for approval.</p><p>DEP, in a press release announcing the penalty, said the agreement shows that the company “has demonstrated its intention to correct its unlawful conduct to DEP’s satisfaction.”</p><p>“The conditions imposed by this agreement seek to ensure that ETC will get this right,” DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell said in a statement. “Anything less is unacceptable.””</p><p><em>Anya Litvak: <a href="mailto:alitvak@post-gazette.com" target="_blank">alitvak@post-gazette.com</a>&nbsp;412-263-1455.</em></p><p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/newsletters" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2019/06/03/BOPnewsletterinsert" alt="Go to section"> </a></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/01/03/Energy-Transfer-30M-penalty-pipeline-explosion-permit-ban-Revolution-Mariner-East/stories/202001030137</original_url>
