<p>Communities around the Pittsburgh region marked Juneteenth Friday with celebrations of history and calls for action against injustice today.</p>
<p>Stop the Violence-Pittsburgh organized the Juneteenth Freedom Walk and Tour on Friday. William Marshall, the organization's founder, guided participants around several Black historic sites in the city where they received short presentations from local historians and professors.</p>
<p>Last year, a three-day Juneteenth festival drew around 20,000 people to Point State Park to celebrate the day marking the final abolition of slavery in the United States when Union troops reached Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865.</p>
<p>While COVID-19 concerns made such a gathering impossible this year, Stop the Violence-Pittsburgh's Mr. Marshall still wanted a way to share the rich history of Black people in Pittsburgh, so they also made their tour virtual.</p>
<p>“We noticed a lack of history that we’re being taught in this community and in society,” Mr. Marshall said. “People are interested in learning their history.”</p>
<p>Friday's event began in the Hill District, formerly known as Arthursville, which was a hub for Underground Railroad activity and hosted a tight-knit community of Black people in the 1800s.</p>
<p>Other stopping points included the historical marker for Avery College, the Fort Pitt Block House, the original sites of the Bethel A.M.E. Church and the Monongahela House hotel, publisher Martin Delany’s historic marker and Market Square.</p>
<p>“This history is about activism,” historian Sarah J. Martin told participants during her presentation about Pittsburgh’s role in the Underground Railroad. “This history is about cooperation, this history is about the need and the desire to be free and to have equity and the opportunities to advance yourself.”</p>
<p>Hundreds of people followed along with the event on Facebook Live through the Western Pennsylvania Juneteenth Celebration Facebook page. One participant tuned in from Japan and others watched from South Carolina and Texas. Around 20 people participated in the in-person walk.</p>
<p>Marcia Bandes and her husband, Ron, who live in Squirrel Hill, joined the walking tour because they thought they could use a history lesson even after 12 years of living in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“You don’t hear about all the good parts [of Black history],” Ms. Bandes said. She alluded to the fact that four Black men signed the document that established Allegheny County as an example.</p>
<p>“These are things that get buried, and it’s so wrong. These are the things that should be taught in schools so kids have respect for each other. I’m so glad I came to learn.”</p>
<p>Stop the Violence-Pittsburgh will host its annual Juneteenth parade and festival Downtown on Aug. 28-30.</p>
<p><strong>Other observances</strong></p>
<p>In East Pittsburgh, protesters and public officials marched with Michelle Kenney, the mother of Antwon Rose II who was shot and killed by an East Pittsburgh police officer while running from a traffic stop on June 19, 2018.</p>

<p>Marchers rallied at a stage set up at the location where Antwon was killed to offer speeches calling for community action. Among those addressing the crowd was state Rep. Ed Gainey, D-Lincoln-Lemington, according to PG news partner KDKA-TV, who called for support for reforms on use of police force. Other officials in attendance included state Rep. Austin Davis, D-McKeesport. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, were among the participants.</p>

<p>In Cranberry, around 100 people gathered at the Target to protest against police brutality and the killing of George Floyd and others on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Beginning at 3 p.m., the protest began in the parking lot of the Target, and, following some speeches by main organizer Megan Russell and others, marched around the lot with signs that read "Black Lives Matter" and "No Justice, No Peace."</p>
<p>"We need more black voices," Ms. Russell said.</p>
<p>The event, which lasted about an hour and a half, was peaceful from beginning to end. Cranberry Chief of Police Kevin Meyer, who observed the protest at a distance, noted "We had a dialogue right off the bat."</p>
<p>"My hope is that we can get beyond this and open more dialogue between us and the community moving forward," Chief Meyer said.</p>

<p>In Wilkinsburg, KDKA-TV reported participants marched from the borough down Penn Avenue into Pittsburgh through East Liberty, finally rallying for addresses and a picnic hosted by the organizers, the Allegheny County Black Activist/Organizer Collective at Mellon Park.</p>
<p>And Pittsburgh's Schenley Park was the scene of the Black LGBTQ Liberation Car Cruise honoring the Black community's queer and trans ancestors.</p>
