<h1>Britain’s health minister says she is infected with new virus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nadine Dorries, a British health minister, confirmed reports late on Tuesday that she had tested positive for the coronavirus. She had attended a reception at Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s official residence two days earlier.</p>
<p>Ms. Dorries, a junior minister in the Department of Health, said in a post on Twitter that she had felt “pretty rubbish,” but hoped that the worst of the viral illness had come and gone. British news reports said she was the first member of Parliament to test positive.</p>

<p>Health officials were rushing to trace her contacts, which included meetings with dozens of constituents and in Parliament with lawmakers, as well as co-workers at the Department of Health and Social Care, according to British news outlets. She was at 10 Downing St., Mr. Johnson’s residence, on Sunday for International Women’s Day.</p>
<p>The news sparked discussion in Britain about whether Parliament would need to be suspended. Lawmakers meet in the cramped House of Commons, sitting shoulder to shoulder on green leather benches and often spilling into the aisles and standing room areas, creating fertile conditions for illness to spread.</p>
<p>Some observers noted that Ms. Dorries appeared to have voted in the House of Commons about a week ago, meaning she had at least brief contact with other lawmakers at a time when she was presumably contagious.</p>
<p>But her most dangerous contact may have been with her 84-year-old mother, who is staying with her, Ms. Dorries wrote on Twitter late Tuesday night. “Thanks for so many good wishes,” Ms. Dorries wrote, adding that her mother had developed a cough. “She is being tested tomorrow,” she wrote. “Keep safe and keep washing those hands, everyone.”</p>
<p>Britain has confirmed 373 cases of COVID-19, and six deaths.</p>
