<h1> U.S. military isn’t investigating Vindman </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The top civilian official in the U.S. Army said the service isn’t investigating Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, days after President Donald Trump told reporters that the military may look into disciplining the former National Security Council official and key impeachment inquiry witness.</p>
<p>Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said Friday there is no investigation into Lt. Col. Vindman, who had been detailed to the White House National Security Council as Ukraine director and was due to return to the Army for a new assignment when Mr. Trump dismissed him early from the post last week. The president also removed his twin brother from his job as a lawyer for the NSC.</p>
<p>Mr. McCarthy, in response to a question during an event at the National Press Club in Washington, noted that Lt. Col. Vindman was currently in a “bridging” assignment at the Department of the Army headquarters and would be heading to a senior service college for study this summer.</p>
<p>“There’s no investigation,” Mr. McCarthy said.</p>
<p>Lt. Col. Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient, handled Ukraine issues for the NSC while Mr. Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani pressured the country’s new leader to announce investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and the Democrats.</p>
<p>During his public testimony to the House impeachment inquiry, Lt. Col. Vindman said he thought Mr. Trump’s demand that a foreign government investigate Mr. Biden and his son was improper.</p>
<p>Late last week, Mr. Trump dismissed Lt. Col. Vindman and his brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, who was serving as a lawyer on the National Security Council, from their White House posts. Both officers remain in the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, when asked about Alexander Vindman’s dismissal, Mr. Trump said “the military can handle him.” Asked what that meant, Mr. Trump replied: “If you look at what happened, they’re going to certainly, I would imagine, take a look at that.”</p>
<p>Mr. McCarthy, however, said Friday that there was no such move to look into Lt. Col. Vindman.</p>
