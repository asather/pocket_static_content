<h1>Steelers told to stay home for camp, ending 54-year tradition at Saint Vincent College</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For 54 years, the Steelers held their training camp at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, but that streak is coming to an end this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The NFL has told all teams stay at their training facilities for training camp this year in an attempt to keep spread of the virus at a minimum.</p>
<p>The Steelers took over the Saint Vincent campus every summer since 1966. The Rooney family loves the rural environment and quaint atmosphere, and head coach Mike Tomlin enjoys the team-building aspect that going away to camp provides.</p>
<p>Saint Vincent College has become a destination for Steelers fans from all over the world. Practices have been free and open to the public for years, and recently the team has added a pro shop and other activities to draw fans to the Westmoreland County college town. Cars line up outside campus and wait in line for hours just to be first onto campus.</p>
<p>But the fan tradition would have been hard to uphold with social distancing guidelines still recommended, and the Steelers have everything they need to hold training camp at their training facility on the South Side. The UPMC Rooney Sports Complex is equipped with three practice fields and an indoor field. The Steelers train there during the season along with the Pitt football team.</p>
<p>The Steelers are scheduled to kick off the preseason slate Aug. 6 in the Hall of Fame Game against the Cowboys. Those games remain on the schedule, but the possibility exists the preseason might be shortened due to the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
