<h1>President Trump calls protesters who confronted Pittsburgh diners 'Thugs!'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A viral video of a weekend protest in Pittsburgh in which anti-racism <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/09/07/Pittsburgh-protest-police-investigate-video-restaurant-clash-diners-Mercato-Penn-Avenue-Downtown/stories/202009070059" target="_blank">demonstrators were seen confronting Downtown restaurant patrons</a> elicited a strong reaction from President Donald Trump on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a pair of tweets, Mr. Trump called the protesters&nbsp;“thugs” and their actions&nbsp;“disgraceful” — weighing in on the video, which has been viewed millions of times on social media and shows demonstrators shouting profanities at outdoor diners at Sienna Mercato on Penn Avenue.</p>
<p>“[Black Lives Matter] Protesters horribly harass elderly Pittsburgh diners, scaring them with loud taunts while taking their food right off their plate,” Mr. Trump wrote in one tweet. “These Anarchists, not protesters, are [Joe] Biden voters, but he has no control and nothing to say. Disgraceful. Never seen anything like it. Thugs!”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, who’s made “law and order” and defending law enforcement a main pillar of his re-election campaign, has sought to label the nationwide protest movement over racial justice a conduit for rioting and looting — and has used his social media accounts and public statements to draw attention to specific incidents across the U.S., though a <a href="https://acleddata.com/2020/09/03/demonstrations-political-violence-in-america-new-data-for-summer-2020/" target="_blank">recent study said</a>&nbsp;that nearly 95% of demonstrations have been peaceful.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police are investigating what occurred in the videos from Saturday’s protest. They could not be reached for further comment on the protests.</p>
<p>In the footage, some patrons who are eating outside begin to leave their tables. One protester approaches a table where an older couple is seated and drinks one of their beverages.</p>
<p><em><strong>Warning to our readers:</strong> The footage in these two videos contains violence and graphic language.</em></p>

<p>Another video shows a protester yelling through a megaphone at a man holding a bicycle. The protester pushes the megaphone into the bicyclist’s head, the bicyclist smacks the megaphone, and another protester hits the bicyclist in the head with a skateboard. It is not clear from the video what started the confrontation.</p>
<p>The older couple in the first video, who asked to remain anonymous, told Post-Gazette news partner KDKA-TV that they support the Black Lives Matter movement, but that the few people who caused the disruption were not part of the movement.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, who only referenced the first video of outdoor diners, wrote in a followup tweet that&nbsp;“this thuggery is happening in other Democrat run cities and states” because of&nbsp;“weak and pathetic Democrat leadership.”</p>
<p>“Must shut them down fast,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Biden and his most Liberal in Senate running mate, Kamala [Harris], won’t even talk about it. They won’t utter the words, LAW &amp; ORDER!”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s campaign could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has warned that a Biden presidency would&nbsp;“surrender your nation to the radical left-wing mob” and to looters and rioters who have&nbsp;“attacked law enforcement” and burned businesses.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, meanwhile, denounced rioting and looting <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/08/31/joe-biden-pittsburgh-campaign-trump-hazelwood-green/stories/202008310089" target="_blank">during a speech in Pittsburgh</a> last week, but also denounced violence by&nbsp;“extremists and opportunists” who have brought weapons to protests, and the violence of&nbsp;“unwarranted police shootings” and&nbsp;“excessive force” by law enforcement.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety issued a statement that says police will protect citizens’ First Amendment rights and try to ensure safe protests.</p>
<p>“However, the actions of a few protesters last weekend were unacceptable,” the statement reads. “Police are working with our law enforcement partners, including the US Attorney’s Office and FBI Pittsburgh, to investigate. Part of that process is collecting video evidence and attempting to interview witnesses. If laws were broken, charges will follow.”</p>
<p>Wendell Hissrich, the city’s public safety director, said the protest Saturday in Downtown was&nbsp;“embarrassing.”</p>
<p>“People have the right to dine in public without being accosted and without vulgarities being thrown at them,” he said. “What we saw this weekend was assault and battery. It was embarrassing. The vast majority of the protests in Pittsburgh have been peaceful, but this weekend was anything but peaceful.”</p>
<p>Police Chief Scott Schubert said the protesters’ message is lost when it is accompanied by violence.</p>
<p>“As a native Pittsburgher, what I saw this weekend was disturbing and cannot continue,” Chief Schubert said. “Sadly, the protesters’ message gets erased when you have certain organizers inciting violence, which is what a handful of them are doing. It creates a dangerous and volatile situation.”</p>
