<h1>Ohio governor’s order ends ‘mind-boggling’ flood of Pa. customers at liquor stores</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Before Monday afternoon, liquor stores in counties across Ohio were overflowing — with Pennsylvanians.</p>
<p>“It’s mind-boggling,” Linda Johnson, the manager of the liquor store at Devine Shop and Save in Hubbard, a small town just five minutes from the border, said around noon on Monday. “95 percent of our customers are from Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>Yet at 3 p.m., an announcement from Columbus ended the party. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine ordered that liquor stores in the six Ohio counties closest to Pennsylvania — Ashtabula, Trumbull, Mahoning, Columbiana, Jefferson and Belmont — can only sell liquor to customers with Ohio IDs.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“Any other time we would love to have visitors from Pennsylvania,” the governor said at a news conference, “but during this time, those who are coming in to buy liquor are creating a health hazard.”</p>
<p>Ms. Johnson said, just hours after the initial conversation with the Post-Gazette, that the order will “definitely” impact business.</p>
<p>“It’s not good,” she said. She added that Devine Shop and Save had already put up signs announcing the change and had begun turning Pennsylvanian shoppers away.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf did not include liquor stores on the list of “life-sustaining” businesses that are allowed to remain open while social distancing measures are in place, and so the state-run Fine Wine and Good Spirits stores closed their doors on March 16. On April 1, the website of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board began allowing a limited number of delivery orders, but the site’s capacity remains too low to meet sky-high demand, leaving Pennsylvanians with few options for acquiring whiskey, vodka and other hard drinks.</p>
<p>In response, stores in western Maryland, northern West Virginia and eastern Ohio have seen a flood in customers from Western Pennsylvania. Kim Spear, the manager of Friendsville Discount Liquors in Maryland, said that her business has tripled since Pennsylvania closed its liquor stores.</p>
<p>“Normally, I’d order a case of Tito’s, or two, a week,” Ms. Spear said. “Now, it’s three or four a week, on top of everything else in the store, too.”</p>
<p>She said that most of the business is coming from Pennsylvania — she can tell, she noted, due to the license plates on the cars — and that the store has had to implement strict social distancing measures in response to the influx, letting only one person in the store at a time.</p>
<p>“We’re open because we’re considered essential,” Ms. Spear said. “I imagine they’ll keep coming, as long as the PA stores are closed.”</p>
<p>Shawn Kelly, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, said in an emailed statement that the decision to close Pennsylvania liquor stores was “tremendously difficult” but ultimately necessary to protect public health.</p>
<p>“We understand the public wants to have access to wines and spirits during these unprecedented times, but we have a responsibility to mitigate community spread of this virus to every extent possible and make sure our employees and our customers are as safe as they can be,” Mr. Kelly said.</p>
<p>He also said that it is illegal to bring alcohol into Pennsylvania “unless it is purchased at a licensed out-of-state winery or licensed out-of-state distillery or through a direct wine shipper or a direct malt or brewed beverage licensee,” indicating that Pennsylvanians may risk legal exposure by buying out-of-state.</p>
<p>Ms. Johnson said that many out-of-state customers were buying large quantities of spirits, noting that she had several customers Monday who had made purchases totaling hundreds of dollars. The increased demand strained their supplies, she said.</p>
<p>“They’re coming in and buying everything in half-gallons, in cases,” she said. “Our usual delivery is 120 cases in a week. We’ve had 800 cases over the last two weeks, and I still have empty shelves.”</p>
<p>She pointed out that this was lost business for Pennsylvanian liquor stores.</p>
<p>“I think they’re the only state that [closed liquor stores], and I don’t know why they did,” Ms. Johnson said. “You guys are losing a lot of money in Pa., that’s for sure”</p>
<p>It appears that Pennsylvanians are not willing to drive all that far for their liquor, however. Mihir Patel, Manager of Didi’s Beverage in Niles, Ohio — roughly 30 minutes from the border — said that he has not seen an increase in sales, and that his business is struggling due to the loss of wholesale clients.</p>
<p>“Basically all my wholesales are gone,” Mr. Patel said, lamenting the closure of local restaurants.</p>
<p>Candella Micro-Distillery LLC in Boardman, Ohio, has transitioned to manufacturing and selling another high-demand product, hand sanitizer, but managers Phil Candella and Marty Yavorcik said they have also seen liquor fly off the shelves.</p>
<p>“We’re all sold out of vodka,” Mr. Candella said. “We’re just selling bourbon and wine now, and we’re making more wine as we speak.”</p>
<p>They, too, credited the increase in business to Pennsylvanians coming across the border, noting that many of their customers had Pennsylvania license plates and left 724 area codes in their logbook.</p>
<p>Mr. Yavorcik said that they would follow the governor’s order “to the T,” and that they would card everyone coming into the store and turn away Pennsylvanians trying to buy liquor — but that they would continue selling them hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>Ohio is not alone in reacting to a rush of thirsty Pennsylvanians: the health department of Monongalia County, W.Va., also banned liquor sales to out-of-state ID-holders on April 4.</p>
<p>A representative from Ashebrooke Liquor Outlet in Morgantown, W.Va., declined to comment, as did store owners at multiple Smoker Friendly’s Liquor Plus locations in West Virginia’s panhandle. A spokesperson for The Kroger Company, which operates several liquor stores close to the border in Ohio, said in a statement that they would follow Mr. DeWine’s order.</p>
<p>When asked his thoughts on whether the governor’s order is a good idea, Mr. Yavorcik laughed. “That’s out of my pay grade,” he joked, and declined to comment.</p>
