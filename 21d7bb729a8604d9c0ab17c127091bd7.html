<h1>Paul Zeise: What can we expect from the Pirates pitching staff?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates could take advantage of a shortened 60-game MLB season to contend in the National League Central. That is at least some reason to be optimistic. Depth is less important, the margin between the top teams and bottom teams is smaller and any team that gets hot can be in contention.</p>
<p>It still comes down to pitching, though, doesn’t it?&nbsp;That’s why I’m not sure exactly what to expect from the Pirates this year.</p>
<p>I’m not one who gets hung up on traditional roles for pitchers, but let’s be honest — who is the ace of this staff? Which pitcher do you trust to take the ball in the midst of a 2-7 stretch and go out and throw a gem to get the team back on track?</p>
<p>Is it Trevor Williams? I believe he has the ability to be a consistent pitcher that wins games and eats innings, but he’s only really showed that consistently for a half season.</p>
<p>How about Joe Musgrove? He was the Pirates best pitcher last season, but that’s not saying a whole lot given the way the staff performed as a whole.</p>
<p>Mitch Keller had a mostly rocky debut as an MLB starter. He has talent and is still young and learning, but he has to grow up in a hurry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the staff is a complete question. Steven Brault is a back of the rotation pitcher coming off a major injury. Chad Kuhl is coming off a major injury. Chris Archer is out. Derek Holland is 33 and coming off a really rough season.</p>
<p>The best case scenario is that Williams, Musgrove and Keller all take the next step as pitchers and give the Pirates a consistent three-man punch that gives them a chance to win games. If that is the case and Brault and/or Kuhl performs on any level, then they would have a chance. But that involves a lot of things going right.</p>
<p>It isn’t much different in the bullpen, either. Keone Kela is the one pitcher you can probably count on being very good at his job in the bullpen. After him,&nbsp;there are a lot of potentially good pitchers, but I’m not sure who has earned trust.</p>
<p>It should be noted, too, that none of these questions or concerns accounts for the fact that the Pirats are learning a new pitching philosophy under a new coaching staff.</p>
<p>Many bets are off in a sprint of a season like the one we’ll soon see. And yes, the Pirates could be contenders this year because of that. But a lot will have to go right when it comes to the pitching staff for that to happen, and that might be asking just a little too much.</p>
