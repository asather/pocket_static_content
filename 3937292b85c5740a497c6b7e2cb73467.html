<h1>James Conner on his health, 'playing to win' and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It is one thing for Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert to believe running back James Conner can return to his 2018 Pro Bowl form after an injury-truncated season. It is still another for Conner to go out and prove it, especially in the final year of his contract.</p>
<p>But Conner, who missed six games and parts of two others with injuries in 2019, isn’t concerned about any of that. With a new streamlined and powerful body that is a byproduct of self-isolation, he said his only objective in 2020 is to win.</p>
<p>Not try and play an entire 16-game schedule for the first time. Not be the player who had the sixth-highest yards per game average in 2018. Not worry if he needs to prove he is worth a second contract.</p>
<p>“I’m not playing for a contract or playing not to get hurt,” Conner said. “I’m playing to win, simple and plain. I have visions of us and me being a big part of Super Bowl No. 7 for this organization.”</p>
<p>Conner’s return to health will be a significant component if the Steelers want to rediscover an offense that fell apart in 2019 after Ben Roethlisberger was injured. The running game was so non-existent that Conner’s season total of 464 yards was the first time in 53 years the Steelers’ leading rusher failed to gain more than 500 yards.</p>
<p>Injuries were a big part, as they have been throughout Conner’s career. But the Steelers are willing to give Conner another shot. They did not sign a veteran running back in free agency and waited until the fourth round to draft Anthony McFarland Jr. of Maryland.</p>
<p>“James Conner had a disappointing season in James Conner’s viewpoint and ours, as well,” Colbert said at the NFL combine in February. “Our point to James was, ‘You had an unfortunate year.’ The year before that, he was one of the best in the league. He’s still a young player. We think there’s something there. We know there’s talent there. We hope James can regain it. And, if he’s healthy, there’s no reason he shouldn’t.”</p>
<p>And if he is, coach Mike Tomlin won’t deviate from what has been his long-held practice of using just one running back, as he once famously said, “until the wheels fall off.” In 2018, when he started 12 of 13 games, Conner averaged 16.5 carries and 74.6 yards per game.</p>
<p>“It’s our job to be at our best, no matter how many carries we get,” Conner said Tuesday during a Zoom call with Pittsburgh-area media members. “Whether I’m the guy or however this year works, the goal is to win. We need to be ready at all times. We can’t warm up to it. I’m not really paying attention to how many carries I need.”</p>
<p>To that end, Conner has used the extra time off because of the COVID-19 pandemic to work out six days a week, sometimes twice a day. The result is a bigger, stronger body that he has displayed on various social-media posts, including one of his back and shoulders that make them look wider than the south end zone at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>“I made a decision to every day get a little better and really take advantage of the down time we had,” Conner said. “I’m going pretty hard. I’m working out a lot. I’m just trying to get strong and live a healthy life style.</p>
<p>“The quarantine helped me get away from all the distractions — to stay home, having to cook at home, not be able to go out on weekends. It forces you to stay at home. While I was home, I was just trying to get better. I had some vacations planned, I wanted to do that, but I didn’t get a chance because of the virus.”</p>
<p>Conner’s history of having lymphatic cancer and a weakened immune system because of the treatment might have put him at significant risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. But that diagnosis was in December 2015, during his junior season at Pitt, and he said he is 100% healthy and not afraid of contracting the virus.</p>
<p>“I had a weak immune system four years ago, I’m not weak anymore,” Conner said. “I’m young and I’m healthy. I’m not concerned about me personally. I’m not going to ignore it, but as far as me being scared or taking extra, extra precaution, that was four years ago. My body has healed. If we follow all protocol and all health guidelines, I will be just fine.”</p>
<p>Now it is time for Conner to prove he can be the No. 1 running back the Steelers still believe he is. And that’s fine by him.</p>
<p>“You have to prove it with this organization and this business with every team; you have to prove it day in and day out,” Conner said. “I put last year behind me. There’s nothing I can do to get last year back. I’m working as hard as possible to be in the best shape ever and be the best football player I can be.</p>
<p>“When I step out on the field this year I’m going to give everything I have. That’s just where my mindset is. I’m not trying to make it bigger than what it is. All is it is perform. It’s not any comeback or this and that. Just go play football.”</p>
