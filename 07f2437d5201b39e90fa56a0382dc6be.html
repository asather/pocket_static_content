<h1>Pet Tales: Helping domestic violence centers that shelter pets, too</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When women and children are beaten and abused, pets in that household often suffer, too. Yet people who flee to shelters because their lives are in danger are rarely allowed to bring dogs, cats and other pets with them. Nationwide, only 10 percent of shelters for domestic violence victims allow animals to seek refuge and safety with their families. But efforts are underway to change that.</p>
<p>Purina has partnered with <a href="https://redrover.org/" target="_blank">RedRover</a>, a nonprofit in Sacramento, Calif., to create the Purple Leash Project. In addition to providing money to help victims escape abusive homes, they support shelters to help make accommodations for pets.</p>
<p>“The best-case scenario is that people and pets live together and heal together,” said Lorie Westhoff, a Purina public relations strategist.</p>
<p>In the last four years, Purina has given $600,000 to Purple Leash, including direct aid to nine shelters that take in victims of domestic violence and their pets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allegheny County has two pet-friendly shelters — Alle-Kiski Area HOPE Center in Tarentum (<a href="http://www.akhopecenter.org)" target="_blank">www.akhopecenter.org)</a> and the Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh in the East End (<a href="https://www.wcspittsburgh.org/" target="_blank">www.wcspittsburgh.org</a>). Both shelters have received money from Red Rover, whose main mission is helping animals in crisis.</p>
<p>During the coronavirus pandemic, the need continues. Though calls to hotlines decreased by as much as 40 percent when stay-at-home orders went into effect, phone calls seeking help increased during the&nbsp;“green” phase when people were able to move about more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No residents or staff at either local shelter has tested positive for COVID-19. Masks are worn by everyone, social distancing has been enforced and cleaning and sanitizing have been increased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2013, the HOPE Center built four dog kennels and enclosures for two cats. They generally shelter about 20 pets per year, usually dogs, said Michelle Gibb, the executive director. Twenty women and children, but no pets, live there now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When animals are there, they are separated from shelter residents in consideration of people who dislike animals or are allergic to them, Ms. Gibb said. The women and children are responsible for feeding their own pets, and walking and playing with them.</p>
<p>“Families are very happy that they can keep their pets,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two years ago, the Women’s Center and Shelter in Pittsburgh built facilities to handle up to six pets at a time. The animals live in the shelter building but on a separate floor from the families who take care of them. The pet quarters and the shelter are usually at capacity, which is 49 women and children, said Nicole Molinaro, president and CEO.</p>
<p>“We haven’t had any pot-bellied pigs or pygmy goats yet, but we have had hamsters and gerbils,” she said.&nbsp;“I was nervous when I heard a snake was coming it, but it was just 5 inches long and it was adorable.”</p>
<p>“The dogs are sometimes traumatized when they come in because they have been abused,” Ms. Molinaro said.</p>
<p>A volunteer trainer comes in to help them. That’s Mary Kennedy Withrow, executive director of Pittsburgh Aviation Animal Rescue Team, but she’s unable to enter the shelter now because of virus restrictions.</p>
<p>According to a news release from Purina, over 70% of women in domestic violence shelters report their abuser threatened, injured or killed a pet. Nearly half of abuse victims said they chose to stay in abusive situations for fear of leaving a beloved pet behind, Purina said.</p>
<p>The Purina/RedRover partnership provides grants to families with pets to help them move out of an abusive situation. Go to <a href="https://redrover.org" target="_blank">Redrover.org</a>&nbsp;to apply.&nbsp;Shelters can go to <a href="https://www.purina.com/about-purina/purple-leash-project/resources" target="_blank">www.purina.com</a>&nbsp;to apply for a Purple Leash Project grant.&nbsp;Go to <a href="https://safeplaceforpets.org/" target="_blank">Safeplaceforpets.org</a>&nbsp;for a list of domestic violence shelters that accept pets.&nbsp;The national Domestic Violence Hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).</p>
