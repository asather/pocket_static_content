<h1>Pirates' projected playoff odds improve with shortened season, but not by much</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When we last checked with the computers about the Pirates’ 2020 chances <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/15/mlb-realignment-proposal-usa-today-divisions-2020-season/stories/202004150117" target="_blank">back in April</a>, they were poor. At the time, MLB was reportedly considering a 100-ish game season played at spring training sites with realigned divisions.</p>
<p>The last two months have changed everything and nothing. MLB is now poised to instead implement a 60-game campaign in home ballparks and with traditional divisional alignments. The Pirates’ chances, though? Still poor.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/the-obscenely-late-obscenely-early-zips-projected-standings/" target="_blank">Dave Szymborski’s industry-leading ZiPs projections</a> for a 60-game season were released Wednesday at Fangraphs, and they expect the Pirates to come in a distant fifth in the NL Central division, six games off the pace at 26-34. Their odds to claim the crown come in at just 6.7% and their overall playoff odds are only slightly better at 13.8%. That’s the fourth-worst mark in the National League.</p>
<p>The good news? Those marks are up significantly, at least, from projections for a longer season. The Pirates’ original odds of making the playoffs over a full season in the NL Central were just 3.3%, and their odds in a shortened season at spring training sites were 1.7%. So possible variance is their friend here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chicago Cubs are your projected winners in the division with a 32-28 record. Their 27.6% odds, however, are closely in line with the rest of the division. Milwaukee (23.4%), St. Louis (21.9%) and Cincinnati (20.4%) are all projected to finish just one game back and all have odds of at least 33.7% to make the postseason bracket.</p>
<p>Around the league, the Los Angeles Dodgers have the best projected record at 38-22. They’re expected to breeze through the NL West, while in the East, Atlanta and defending World Series champion Washington are projected to tie atop their table at 34-26.</p>
<p>In the American League, the New York Yankees are expected to be the class of the field with a 37-23 mark. They’re slated to win the East by two games. Houston in the West (36-24) and Minnesota in the Central (35-25) are considered the closest competition.</p>
<p>The gambling industry takes a similarly dim view of the local team. BetOnline released its win totals for a 60-game season Wednesday, and its findings are right in line with those of Fangraphs. The current over/under is set at 25.5.</p>
