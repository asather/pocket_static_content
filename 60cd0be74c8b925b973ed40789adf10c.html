<h1>Let's talk about the XFL's ambitious rule changes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A year after the Alliance of American Football tried — and failed — to revolutionize the game with dramatic rule changes, the XFL is poised to take an even more aggressive attempt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WWE spinoff, which kicks off its season a week after the Super Bowl in February, announced its rules package Tuesday, and folks, it’s zany. Let’s sort through the highlights. You can read the full package <a href="https://www.xfl.com/rules" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Kickoffs</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKk_FMeZgpo" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Changes: </strong>The play is increasingly a non-factor&nbsp;in the NFL and college football, so the XFL is trying to spice it up by reducing the gap between the return and coverage units to five yards and preventing them from moving until the ball is touched by the returner, or has bounced on the ground for a minimum of the three seconds. Touchbacks downed by the return team on the fly will be moved all the way up to the 35-yard-line while those downed off the bounce will penalize the return team by forcing it to put the ball in play at the 15-yard line. The goal is to give both units incentive to seek returns, while reducing high-speed collisions that frequently result in injury.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> This sounds more like the chaotic start of a dodge ball game than a traditional kickoff. Could it be exciting? Sure. Returners might only need to navigate one or two layers of coverage before they’re off to a long return or even a score, meaning you can’t really miss the play while grabbing a snack. But is it ... football? Do we want to see games determined in part by which teams are best at these mad scrambles? We’ll have to see how it works in practice, but the potential exists for this change to cheapen points scored by conventional means.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Point(s) after touchdown</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Changes:</strong> No kicking plays. Offenses will get the option of trying to score from the&nbsp;2-, 5- or 10-yard lines for 1, 2 and 3 points, respectively. Defenses returning turnovers will score points corresponding to where the ball was put in play.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The verdict:</strong> Kudos to the XFL for injecting a layer of fascinating strategy here. Where the AAF simply forced teams to go for two points, the XFL is forcing them to make a decision. Go for a safe point? Go for max points? Go for something in between? There doesn’t seem to be an obvious right answer, which is the point. It will be fun to watch the different philosophies play out. A consensus may emerge eventually, but for now, the range of outcomes seems endless and fun to consider.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Punts</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ew8EZVbxjY" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Changes:</strong> The XFL is heavily disincentivizing this play for offenses by moving touchbacks and kicks out of bounds to the the 35-yard line. Kicking teams also may not cross the line of scrimmage until after the ball is kicked, giving the return team a distinct advantage. The goal is to get offenses to go for it on fourth down more often.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Punting is boring, sure. It’s not a bad idea to try to change the calculation for risk-averse coaches who are prone to playing the field position game in situations where they probably should be pushing for first downs. This particular rule change, however, could have a lot of unintended consequences on play-calling, too. Early-down running plays could be disincentivized because any that don’t go for decent gains will result in poor down-and-distance situations that make those tricky fourth-down decisions more likely. The same will be true of downfield passing plays that bring a higher likelihood of incompletions. The safest calls will be short and intermediate passes that can reliably keep offenses on schedule. That doesn’t sound like the most exciting product, so consider us skeptical of this one for now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Double forward passes</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BTDwkl8_5ZU" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Changes:</strong> Offenses may throw a second forward pass per play, provided the first forward pass does not result in the ball crossing the line of scrimmage.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Tricky, tricky. This seems more like a gimmick than a game-changing alteration, but we’re here for it if it results in one or two plays a game where you scream at your TV in anticipation of seeing a team pull off something crazy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Overtime</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0qs7jzLrnkk" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Changes:</strong> Forget possessions. The XFL is adopting the&nbsp;“shootout” style. Each team gets up to five alternating snaps from the 5-yard line. Scores count as two points. Misses are goose eggs. The team with the most points at the end of five possessions wins. If the teams are still tied after five rounds, they’ll play single rounds until a team wins a round by scoring and getting a stop. The defense can’t score. Defensive penalties result in the offense getting a snap from the 1-yard line. Pre-snap penalties on the offense move the ball back by a distance that corresponds to the round. Post-snap offensive penalties end the play. The goal is to make sure the&nbsp;“best players on both teams” decide the outcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Like the shootout in the NHL, this method of determining a winner after a hard-fought game is inherently reductive. Teams that are best near the goal line will win. Those that aren’t will lose. Most other dimensions of football go out the window, resulting in a watered-down product. The NHL has tried to avoid shootouts by opening up the ice with a period of 3-on-3 overtime, to positive reviews. For that reason, the XFL might be better served by using a period of something resembling normal play — perhaps some 7-on-7 — before going to the shootout as a last resort.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Timing</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Changes:</strong> There will be a 25-second play clock, and the clock will run on incompletions and out-of-bounds plays before the two-minute warning. Teams will have just two timeouts per half. The goal is to pack more action into a smaller time frame. After the two-minute warning, the clock will stop on incompletions and plays that end out of bounds. The clock will also stop briefly after in-bounds plays. The goal is to make ends of halves more exciting by giving trailing teams a better opportunity to score.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong>&nbsp;Reducing downtime between plays is a great idea, and the former changes will hopefully accomplish that goal pretty effectively. The&nbsp;“comeback period” after two minutes, as its called, again risks the cheapening of the results of normal play. This seems to be a theme in the XFL rules, and it’s the one major qualm we have with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Other changes</strong></span></p>
<p>●There will be no replay challenges for coaches. All reviews will be initiated by a replay official. <strong>Verdict:</strong> Hopefully he or she isn’t initiating too many of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>●The catch rule has been simplified from the NFL version. <strong>Verdict:</strong> Yeah, OK. We’ll see. Easier said than done.</p>
<p>●Dedicated ball-spotting official. <strong>Verdict:</strong> Great idea in theory, given the guesswork that’s often involved with spotting the ball. Will it work in practice?</p>
<p>●All skill players will have coach-to-player helmet communications. <strong>Verdict:</strong> Meh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>●The illegal man downfield rule has been simplified. Only eligible players are allowed more than three yards down field. Period. <strong>Verdict:</strong> The rationale explicitly mentions that current college and NFL rules are difficult to officiate on run-pass option plays (RPOs.) Should be interesting to see what kind of impact this rule has on such play calls.&nbsp;</p>
