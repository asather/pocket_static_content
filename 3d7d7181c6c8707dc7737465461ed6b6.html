<h1>Sewickley council president photographed with militia retains office</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Sewickley Borough Council president who faced calls to resign after appearing in a photo with armed militia members at a protest in April was not removed from his leadership post on Friday. In a special meeting of council, a party-line majority of the nine-member body sided with the defense of his intentions and record in the community over doubts about his judgment and how it impacted the image of the borough.</p>
<p>The vote to keep Republican Jeff Neff in command of the council came at the end of the marathon virtual meeting, which included more than two hours of impassioned comments from Sewickley residents about a viral photo of Mr. Neff posing with an armed militia group at a Pittsburgh protest organized by detractors of Gov. Tom Wolf’s statewide stay-at-home orders and business closures.</p>
<p>In the photo, Mr. Neff — who is running for state Senate in the 37th district — is holding a campaign sign at the center of the firearm-touting Iron City Citizens Response Unit, a militia group that purports to stand up against “tyranny and oppression.” Its members were seen in other photos at the rally wearing patches of insignia that included a symbol that the Anti-Defamation League claims has been appropriated by some white nationalists.</p>
<p>It was a photo that led&nbsp;Sewickley Mayor Brian Jeffe to call on Mr. Neff to step down and elicited responses from a split council and dozens of residents — some of whom said Mr. Neff damaged Sewickley’s reputation, ignored science to attend a large gathering against the governor’s orders and took too long to apologize for the photo. Others defended Mr. Neff’s intentions and insisted that calls for his ouster were politically motivated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Neff opened the meeting with a lengthy statement, in which he expounded on his roots in the community and said he realizes the photo&nbsp;“looks terrible” because the group was dressed in&nbsp;“an intimidating way” wearing camouflage and holding military-style weapons. Though he noted that the militia group says it&nbsp;“explicitly [denounces] any form of racism and all are welcome,” he said it doesn’t change that the picture was interpreted&nbsp;“as a form of aggression or racism or white supremacy.”</p>
<p>Claiming that he didn’t know the group was a militia, Mr. Neff said he is not a member of a militia, recognizes that people are&nbsp;“deeply disturbed by the image of this group in camouflage with weapons” and admits appearing in it was in poor judgment.</p>
<p>“I denounce white supremacy, and I always have and always will,” Mr. Neff said.</p>
<p>“I made a mistake, I apologize to this council for what they have been through, I apologize to the members of the community, and I ask you to forgive me,” Mr. Neff added.</p>
<p>Democratic members of council countered that the only way to restore the public’s trust is to remove Mr. Neff from the presidency or otherwise risk giving&nbsp;“tacit support for divisiveness, extremism and hate,” as one councilwoman put it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Councilwoman Christine Allen, who had called for the special meeting, said she was concerned about the&nbsp;“apparent disregard for public health and the defiance of the state’s stay-at-home order” by Mr. Neff and the protesters, and also warned that the photo associates Sewickley with white nationalism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is a defining moment for Sewickley. As we watch events unfold, we need to take action to be very clear that we all stand against white nationalism,” Ms. Allen said, adding that civil discourse is important, but “tolerance stops at Nazis and white nationalism.”</p>
<p>Alleging that Mr. Neff put his state political campaign over his duty to Sewickley, councilwoman Cynthia Mullins said it’s a matter of&nbsp;“standard of leadership” and that he should step down from the council presidency to focus on his Senate bid. She also fought back against claims that Democrats were undertaking a political hit job and said calls from residents asking Mr. Neff to step down were not&nbsp;“make-believe.”</p>
<p>In the direct aftermath of the photo, which was first reported by Pittsburgh City Paper, Mr. Neff released a statement saying that the picture was “over analyzed,” and that “inevitably, political opponents try to capitalize on them.” He accused his Republican primary opponent, Devlin Robinson — whose spokesman said Mr. Neff “showed shockingly poor judgment in posing with an armed ‘militia’ whose members wore symbols commonly associated with racism” —&nbsp;of inflating the situation for political purposes.</p>
<p>Mr. Neff’s defenders on council, who joined him in voting 5-4 along party lines to keep him in power, defended his record in the community as a lifelong resident, youth sports coach and volunteer firefighter, and said that calls for him to step down were based on intolerance of people holding different political opinions.</p>
<p>Councilman Sean Figley defended the militia group, too, quoting the Anti-Defamation League writing about the symbol in question — the Valknot — that “one&nbsp;should carefully examine it in context rather than assume that a particular use of the symbol is racist.”</p>
<p>Mr. Neff said the militia group was gathered, like others at the protest, to have an honest discussion about the governor’s shutdown and whether it’s creating more harm than good.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m willing to talk and listen to anyone, but this picture does not depict who Jeff Neff is,” Mr. Neff told the council.</p>
<p>Mr. Neff is running for the Republican nomination against Mr. Robinson, a Marine veteran and business owner, with the hopes of facing Democratic incumbent Pam Iovino in November. The primary is June 2.</p>
