<h1>Legislature approves natural gas tax credit to lure petrochemical makers to Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Years after Pennsylvania offered Royal Dutch Shell one of the largest tax incentives in state history to build a petrochemical plant in Beaver County, concerns about climate change, plastics pollution and the future economic identity of the region <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2019/11/09/peduto-fitzgerald-climate-action-summit-pittsburgh-cracker-plant-potter-beaver-county/stories/201911090049" target="_blank">prompted a debate</a>: If leaders had to do it again, should they make the same choice?</p>
<p>The answer from the General Assembly on Tuesday was a resounding yes.</p>
<p>By a bipartisan vote of 39-11 in the Senate and 157-35 in the House, legislators approved a <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/BillInfo.cfm?syear=2019&amp;sind=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1100" target="_blank">multimillion dollar tax credit</a> for future petrochemical and fertilizer plants that use Pennsylvania natural gas as a feedstock.</p>
<p>It is modeled on the tax credit written for the Shell cracker plant in Potter Township, but it incentivizes the use of natural gas broadly rather than just ethane, a co-product found in western Pennsylvania shale gas.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue estimates the program would amount to $22 million per year per plant in foregone taxes until the end of 2050 when the bill sunsets, which equals about $600 million per plant over that time frame.</p>
<p>Governor Tom Wolf has said he will veto the bill because he thinks such incentives should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, his spokesman said.</p>
<p>If Tuesday’s vote counts hold, the General Assembly could override a veto.</p>
<p>In the Senate Tuesday, Sen. John Yudichak, I-Luzerne, said the tax credit “will support the development of a robust petrochemical manufacturing industry in Pennsylvania,” and replicate “the economic win” promised by <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/08/13/Shell-cracker-Trump-protesters-plastics-ethane-oil-gas-Beaver-EPA-regulations-pennsylvania/stories/201908130059" target="_blank">the $6 billion Shell plant</a> elsewhere in the state.</p>
<p>“Let us give every region — every region — of Pennsylvania the chance at an economic win,” he said.</p>
<p>Under House Bill 1100, a company would be eligible for the new tax credit if it invests at least $450 million to build a manufacturing plant and creates at least 800 combined construction and permanent jobs. An earlier version of the bill would have required a $1 billion investment and 1,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The bill also requires a company to pay its construction workers the prevailing wage rate and make “good faith efforts” to employ local laborers.</p>
<p>In exchange, the company would receive a tax credit of 47 cents per thousand cubic feet of natural gas it purchases to make petrochemicals or fertilizers in Pennsylvania, equal to up to 20% of its annual tax liability.</p>
<p>In comparison, the <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/uconsCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;yr=2012&amp;sessInd=0&amp;act=0085.&amp;chpt=000.&amp;sctn=019.&amp;subsctn=000." target="_blank">ethane tax incentive</a> requires a larger investment for a larger estimated tax credit. An ethane cracker must invest at least $1 billion and create at least 2,500 construction jobs in exchange for a tax credit of 5 cents per gallon of ethane it turns into ethylene, for up to 20% of its tax liability.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/businessnews/2012/06/05/Shell-could-get-1-65-billion-in-tax-credits-for-petrochemical-plant-in-Monaca/stories/201206050257" target="_blank">At the time it was crafted</a>, the ethane incentive was expected to be worth up to $66 million a year to Shell, or $1.6 billion through the year 2044.</p>
<p>Environmental groups and renewable energy companies oppose the bill, which they say should not reward the fossil fuel and chemical industries, at least not exclusively.</p>
<p>Rob Altenburg, director of the environmental group PennFuture’s Energy Center, said it would be fine for the Legislature to offer a tax credit to any company that invests the same amount of money in Pennsylvania and creates the same number of jobs.</p>
<p>“But what they said is, ‘If you are a petrochemical company and you make these investments we’ll give you a tax credit.’ Any other company? Too bad,” he said.</p>
<p>“They didn’t even consider that there are clean energy alternatives, efficiency alternatives, that could do a better job at bringing industry to Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>The Consumer Energy Alliance, whose members include major oil and gas producers and users, said the bill “will keep Pennsylvania’s natural gas-driven economic revival thriving.”</p>
<p>At least one company has said the incentive would influence its decision to build a plant in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The CEO of Connecticut-based Elis Energy, Inc. wrote to the governor on Tuesday that his firm is exploring development of a methanol manufacturing facility in northeastern Pennsylvania. Its projected investment is $450 million and the creation of 800 construction and operations jobs — enough to qualify after the bill’s eligibility thresholds were lowered on Monday.</p>
<p>The tax credit “will significantly improve the economics of the project,” CEO&nbsp;Michel Goldschneider wrote.</p>
