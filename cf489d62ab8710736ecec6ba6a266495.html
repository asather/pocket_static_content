<h1>Manchester Craftsmen's Guild announces fund for jazz musicians</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Manchester Craftsmen’s Guild has created a $20,000 Jazz Music Performance Fund to support 50 Pittsburgh-area musicians in the coming months.</p>
<p>Citing the dry spell forced on musicians and venues by COVID-19, MCG Jazz executive producer Marty Ashby said the fund is intended to spark musicians’ creative interest and to facilitate the composition of new music or new arrangements.</p>
<p>Bassist Dwayne Dolphin, saxophonist Lynn Speakman and guitarist Mark Strickland are among 10 local musicians chosen by MCG Jazz and jazzPGH to create projects to be performed at least twice. MCG Jazz is working with Pittsburgh venues to coordinate performances when restrictions are lifted. The cost of the performances will be covered by the fund.</p>
<p>Three of the projects will be broadcast on The CW this summer as part of Allegheny County parks Summer Concert Series. Radio station WZUM will document and follow the projects’ progress in the coming months.</p>
<p>The fund is supported by individuals and the Opportunity Fund</p>
