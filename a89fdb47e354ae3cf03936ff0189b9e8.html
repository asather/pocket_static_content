<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved housing protections for renters <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/04/27/Pittsburgh-City-Council-Housing-Discrimination-racism-COVID-19-Erika-Strassburger/stories/202004270110" target="_blank">no matter their immigration status or native language</a>.</p>
<p>The ordinance expands the city’s anti-discrimination code to include&nbsp;"perceived or actual” citizenship status and language — spoken or written -— as protected classes for housing and public accommodation.</p>
<p>The city’s Commission on Human Relations enforces the anti-discrimination code.</p>
<p>“By and large these are cases we hear about that complainants are far too scared to report because they didn't have protections,” said Megan Stanley, the commission’s executive director.&nbsp;“... It won't change overnight, but we hope it will be one step in the right direction to let them know we care, [and] we can be a constant, trustworthy presence.”</p>
<p>Ms. Stanley said that cases include landlords charging higher security deposits or rent; some situations reportedly escalate to sexual harassment, physical assault or blackmail.</p>
<p>Councilwoman Erika Strassburger introduced the bill on April 28 with support from Mayor Bill Peduto. Council members Corey O’Connor, Bruce Kraus, Daniel Lavelle, Ricky Burgess and&nbsp;Bobby Wilson joined as co-sponsors.</p>
