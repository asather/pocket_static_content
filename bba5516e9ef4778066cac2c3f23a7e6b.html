<h1>Woman who killed FBI agent files for compassionate release after contracting COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A woman who in 2008 killed a Pittsburgh FBI agent has asked for compassionate release from prison after contracting COVID-19.</p>
<p>Christina Korbe in 2011&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2011/01/18/Korbe-pleads-to-voluntary-manslaughter-firearms-charge/stories/201101180170" target="_blank">pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter</a> after killing Special Agent Samuel Hicks during a November 2008 raid into her home to arrest her husband, a drug dealer.</p>
<p>She was sentenced to 15 years and 10 months in prison.</p>
<p>She began showing symptoms of COVID-19 on March 29, five days after her roommate was quarantined, court documents say. She was&nbsp;“ordered to strip her roommate’s bedding, bag it and put it with the trash.”</p>
<p>Korbe is due for release from federal prison in Danburry, Ct. on May 18, 2022.</p>
<p>After contracting COVID-19, she experienced a headache for 31 days, lost her sense of taste and smell, experienced body aches and nausea and coughed so hard she believed she fractured a rib, court documents state.</p>
<p>According to the court filing, nearly 10% of prisoners in the Federal Bureau of Prisons system have contracted the novel coronavirus, and at least 113 have died.</p>
<p>In 2008, law enforcement arrived at her home to serve an arrest warrant on her husband, Robert Korbe. Christina, believing the officials to be home intruders, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/uncategorized/2008/11/21/The-fatal-shot-Was-Christina-Korbe-protecting-her-two-children/stories/200811210172" target="_blank">fired one shot</a> at Mr. Hicks from a second-floor stairwell and ran into her bedroom to call 911.</p>
<p>Mr. Hicks breached the front door and was wearing a bulletproof vest, but the shot passed through the vest’s shoulder strap and entered his chest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert Korbe in 2011 pleaded guilty to mail fraud, cocaine distribution and illegal firearms charges, and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Earlier this year, he admitted involvement in a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/08/robert-korbe-prison-drug-case-guilty-plea-cocaine-dealer-christina-korbe-fbi-agent-sam-hicks/stories/202006080095" target="_blank">wide-scale drug ring</a> inside the U.S. prison system.</p>
<p>“Ms. Korbe has never wavered from her position that she did not intend to kill a law&nbsp;enforcement officer,” reads the filing, undersigned by Connecticut attorney W. Theodore Koch III. “This has never meant, however, that she has denied culpability or lacked&nbsp;remorse. Indeed, she is full of remorse.”</p>
<p>Korbe officially requested compassionate release from the prison warden April 13, but did not receive a response after waiting more than a month, court filings say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She wrote, “Please Warden i have been incarcerated for 11 1/2 years and have 2&nbsp;children and an 87 year old mother who has suffered 3 strokes and have lost my&nbsp;father to stomach cancer All while my 74 yr. old father-in -law is raising my 2&nbsp;children alone [sic].”</p>
<p>Citing the federal First Step Act, which allows sentencing courts to reduce prison terms for “extraordinary and compelling reasons,” Mr. Koch argued that Korbe’s family health issues and her own experience with COVID-19, and because she took classes and volunteered while in prison, mean she meets the criteria.</p>
<p>“As all of the above shows, Ms. Korbe clearly is not a danger to the community,” Mr. Koch wrote. “Moreover, the fact that she has survived the virus once, and persists in her desire to remain&nbsp;healthy despite the myriad health challenges noted in her medical records, there are extraordinary&nbsp;and compelling reasons to allow her to be released at this time.”</p>
<p>Mr. Koch added, in addition to Korbe’s debilitating health and since she is a year from being eligible for release into a halfway house,&nbsp;“the fact that the remorse she displayed at sentencing has inspired her to move her own life in the&nbsp;only direction it could go: toward healing herself and others around her.”</p>
