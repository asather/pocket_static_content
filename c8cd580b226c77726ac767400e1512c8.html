<h1>'We're brothers': In time of need, Duquesne's Maceo Austin receives support</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nobody would have blamed Maceo Austin if he wanted to sit out Wednesday night’s game against Fordham.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Duquesne’s freshman wing was dealt a heavy blow in recent days when his older sister, Sara, passed away. Dukes coach Keith Dambrot said after Wednesday’s game that he left the decision completely up to Austin, but Austin came to Dambrot and assistant coach Steve McNees and let them know that he wanted to play.</p>
<p>So, to show their support for their teammate in this difficult time, Duquesne’s players donned black socks, and three of them, including Austin, wore black headbands.</p>
<p>And then they did their best to win the game for him.</p>
<p>“It was very important,” junior forward Marcus Weathers said after the game. “We’re gonna continue to support him throughout the whole process of everything that’s going on. That’s what we do. We’re a family. We’re brothers. Everybody in the family is my brother. ... So we’re just gonna continue to support him.”</p>
<p>Added Dambrot:&nbsp;“I’ll tell you, Maceo Austin is a special human being. I’ve told everybody that. He’s one of the best guys I’ve had in a long time. As a person, he’s well respected. He’s thoughtful, he cares, he’s consistent emotionally, he’s just a good human being. So it didn’t surprise me that he played, but I wouldn’t have cared either way.”</p>
<p>Dambrot emphasized that he would have supported Austin fully no matter what, but he also realizes the impact something like this can have on a team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, not everything is storybook. Austin’s first shot of the game, for instance, was a jumper from the short corner that he air-balled badly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, the Dukes didn’t play how they are capable, only managing to beat the Rams, who have yet to win a conference game, with the help of overtime.</p>
<p>“I never make any excuses, but it was a tough couple of days,” Dambrot said. “When one of your best kids goes through what he went through, it’s hard on everybody, because a lot of our guys have had similar issues. So it just drains you a little bit, and I felt like they wanted to win so badly for him that at times we just didn’t play very good. But again, nobody in the country’s playing good every night.”</p>
<p>The important thing, as far as the game goes, is that Duquesne did do just enough to win. Austin played a role, too, finishing with six points, five rebounds and four assists — not his best output of the season, but certainly nothing to scoff at, given the circumstances.</p>
<p>More importantly, Austin got to felt the support he has around him firsthand. Across from the Dukes’ bench, members of his family and community from Sharon, Pa., sat in the stands to lend encouragement. To Austin’s left and right, all game long, were his teammates, donning black socks in solidarity.</p>
<p>Understandably, Austin was not made available to the media after the game, but on Twitter, he retweeted and shared kind and encouraging messages sent to him after tweeting about his sister.</p>
<p>There will certainly be brighter days ahead for Austin, both on the court and off. His teammates and coaches seem ready to do everything they can to help him reach them.</p>
<p>“The thing that I stress with them all the time is you just have to fight,” Dambrot said. “Like, you just have to fight, and that’s kinda how I’ve lived my life. When I’ve been down and out, you have a choice. You either put the white flag up and do something else or you fight. So I think the overall lesson is more important than the game, by far. Had we lost the game, I would have been upset, but I wouldn’t have been as upset as I am for what he’s going through.”</p>
