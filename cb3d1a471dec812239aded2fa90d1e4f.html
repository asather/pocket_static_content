<h1>YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh begins reopening with four branches</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh reopened four of its largest branches on Friday as part of a two-phased approach to welcome back visitors.</p>
<p>Doors to the facilities opened at 7 a.m. at Baierl Family YMCA in Franklin Park, Sampson Family YMCA in Plum, Spencer Family YMCA in Bethel Park and Thelma Lovette YMCA in Pittsburgh’s Hill District neighborhood.</p>
<p>In order to combat COVID-19, the YMCA has limited its services and programs to include the wellness floor (cardio and strength), limited group exercise, small group training, virtual life classes and open gym/court access beginning immediately. Outdoor pools will open on July 1.</p>
<p>Other programs and facilities, such as open gym and playgrounds, are temporarily unavailable.</p>
<p>New hours have also been set as part of the reopenings.</p>
<p>The reopened branches will now be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Mondays through Thursdays; 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Fridays and 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays. Senior hours will be every weekday from noon to 2 p.m. The YMCA will be closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>Those branches remaining closed include: Allegheny YMCA on the North Side, Homewood-Brushton YMCA, North Boroughs YMCA in Bellevue and YMCA at U.S. Steel Tower, Downtown. A date for reopening those facilities has not been determined, according to YMCA officials.</p>
<p>Members are reminded that they can use any branch in the Pittsburgh area, the YMCA said.</p>
<p>In the first phase of reopening, access is limited to members, vendors and essential staff at 50% capacity. Staff are required to follow safety guidelines, including washing hands frequently and wearing personal protective equipment. Members are encouraged to wear masks.</p>
<p>Alissa Clendenen, the communications director for the YMCA of Greater Pittsburgh, said the company chose to open its doors to the larger branches because they could easily implement and test safety protocols.</p>
<p>“We think that we can offer a space for members to resume their healthy living journeys in a safe way,” Ms. Clendenen said. “We would not have opened if we didn’t think we could do it.”</p>
<p>Seven summer day camps will be open in phase one as well. These include:</p>
<p>▪ Sampson Family YMCA, ages 4-14 (June 1 - Aug. 14)</p>
<p>▪ Camp Olympus at Setters Cabin Park, ages 6-14 (June 8 - Aug. 21)</p>
<p>▪ Baierl Family Park YMCA, ages 5-12 (June 8 – Sept. 4)</p>
<p>▪ Camp Cloverleaf at South Park, ages 5-14 (June 15 - Aug. 21)</p>
<p>▪ Avonworth Community Park, ages 5-12 (June 15 - Aug. 14)</p>
<p>▪ Homewood-Brushton YMCA, ages 5-14 (June 15 - Aug. 28)</p>
<p>▪ Allegheny YMCA North Side, ages 5-14 (June 22 - Aug. 28)</p>
<p>Campers will be split into groups of 22, smaller than past years, and will be asked to social distance. Additionally, staff will check temperatures and encourage frequent hand washing while implementing disinfecting measures.</p>
<p>Swimming pools have been closed to campers and field trips have been canceled.</p>
<p>Ms. Clendenen said the YMCA considers the day camps as child care, so the company made the decision to open them to help parents who are heading back to work.</p>
<p>“After kids have been inside for weeks, months at this point, the opportunity to get outside and safely interact with friends and peers… It’s a good remedy for leaving quarantine,” Ms. Clendenen said.</p>
<p>Traditional overnight camping at Camp Kon-O-Kwee Spencer in Fombell, Deer Valley YMCA Family Camp in Fort Hill and YMCA Camp Soles in Rockwood have been canceled. However, the YMCA is considering using the grounds for family camps, parent/child programs and volunteer work projects.</p>
<p>After nearly three months without access to facilities, Ms. Clendenen said there are many members who are excited to get back to the YMCA. Though she added that other members are still hesitant about returning.</p>
<p>“There were people at the door at exactly 7 o’clock this morning,” Ms. Clendenen said. “For the people that are ready to return to the gym, there’s definitely a lot of excitement.”</p>
