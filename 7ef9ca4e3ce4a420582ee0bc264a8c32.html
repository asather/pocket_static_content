<p>A Pittsburgh man arrested Saturday by plainclothes city police during a Black Lives Matter protest said&nbsp;“heavily armed” men jumped out of an unmarked van and captured him.</p>
<p>Matthew Cartier, 25, of Pittsburgh, was arrested by city police during the Oakland protest. Police alleged in the criminal complaint that Mr. Cartier was creating a hazard by blocking busy intersections to make way for the marchers,&nbsp;“startling motorists” and causing them to&nbsp;“stop suddenly and unsafely.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Cartier is being charged with failure to disperse and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors, and obstruction to highways or other public passages, a summary offense, according to court documents. He was arraigned at 1:35 a.m. Sunday at Allegheny County Magisterial District Court and released on his own recognizance pending an Aug. 24 preliminary hearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police said in the criminal complaint that officers were monitoring the protest, involving about 150 people, and warned Mr. Cartier multiple times to stop blocking traffic and that he refused. It said officers “did not believe Cartier would cease his course of action” and decided to arrest him.&nbsp;Police confirmed he was arrested by plainclothes police using an unmarked van.</p>
<p>Mr. Cartier declined to comment by phone, <a href="https://twitter.com/orphir_/status/1294966317834022913" target="_blank">but on his Twitter account</a>, he said he was asked by a passenger in the van for directions around the protest. “When I approached the van to provide directions the passenger grabbed me and multiple other men sprang out of the back of the van heavily armed to arrest me. I was driven to the busway where officers searched me and transported me to ACJ [Allegheny County Jail],” he tweeted.</p>
<p>“Every protester must now live in fear of getting grabbed by the police in such a violent and terrifying manner,” he added, demanding that Mayor Bill Peduto answer for the action.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto pledged <a href="https://twitter.com/billpeduto/status/1294837997976915969" target="_blank">in a late-night tweet Saturday</a> to address the matter Sunday after video and transcripts from the arrest are reviewed. He directed Police Chief Scott Schubert and Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich&nbsp;“to fully examine operations taken by Pittsburgh Police and by the individual arrested,” Mayor Peduto said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The police complaint said Mr. Cartier’s actions were recorded on an officer’s body cam and on other video.&nbsp;</p>
