<h1>Buying Here: Black house, white interior add drama to $475,000 North Side house</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Every two years, Heather Johnson and Camden Leeds flip a house in the Central North Side. Each time, they add unexpected splashes of black against white walls and manage to make even a small house seem large.</p>
<p>Their latest creation is <strong>1513 Arch St.</strong> Built in 1910, the all black, wood-frame house originally had three bedrooms and one full bathroom.&nbsp;Today it has three bedrooms, two baths and a glass garage door that opens into the kitchen.&nbsp;It is on the market for $475,000 (MLS No. 1419577) with Heather Edmondson of Keller Williams Realty (<a href="https://kw.com/property/LST-6583268122044743683-7" target="_blank">www.kw.com</a> or 412-370-1815). There will be an open house from 1 to 3 p.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>Ms. Johnson is the main driver of design. Her husband, who works in graphic design, is her partner in <a href="http://www.greywalldevelopment.com/" target="_blank">GreyWall Development</a>. They hire a contractor for 99% of the work. All of their houses are gutted to the studs, new mechanicals are installed and the floor plan is opened up.</p>
<p>The house’s exterior is covered with James Hardie fiber-cement siding. The new windows are aluminum-clad.</p>
<p>“The exterior is my favorite feature,” Ms. Johnson said. “I just love it with the original historic door.”</p>
<p>The house hasn’t had many owners. In 1950, it was purchased by Norma J. Rotunno, a lifelong North Side resident who lived there until her death in 2006. It remained empty until Ms. Johnson and Mr. Leeds bought the house in July 2018. It was painted mint green at one point.</p>
<p>She said her husband spent many hours stripping paint, refinishing old wood and polishing and rebuilding the original brass mail slot and door locks.</p>
<p>“The parts were in a bag. We had new glass installed as well,” Ms. Johnson said.</p>
<p>Inside, white is the dominant color.&nbsp;The living room measures 17 by 14 feet and the dining room 13 by 13 feet. Two fireplaces and the original staircase were painted black. Whitewashed, wide-plank pine floors run throughout the home.</p>
<p>The new 14-by-12-foot kitchen has a center island and a six-burner Verona gas range made in Italy. White quartz counter tops complement green cabinets.</p>
<p>“Green is my favorite color,” Ms. Johnson said.</p>
<p>The aluminum glass garage door in the kitchen was installed by Thomas Giel Garage Door Co.</p>
<p>“We put that in all of our kitchens to expand the indoor living space,” she said.</p>
<p>The door offers a view of the city and access to the adjoining 14-by-6-foot concrete patio. A privacy fence and small backyard add to the indoor/outdoor vibe and make entertaining easy.</p>
<p>A new bathroom features a large soaking tub, a vintage sink and brass fixtures. Geometric floor tile are used in the bathroom and in other spaces.</p>
<p>Upstairs, exposed joists painted black create drama against vaulted ceilings in a hallway and a bathroom. The second-floor bathroom has&nbsp;geometric black and white tile that runs up the shower wall. A leggy double-bowl porcelain farmhouse sink, black fixtures and small brass mirrors add a glam touch.</p>
<p>The 16-by-13-foot master bedroom in the front of the house features an original fireplace mantel, exposed brick and black beams. Three windows flood the room with daylight.&nbsp;The other two bedrooms measure&nbsp;10 by 13 feet and 10 by 8 feet and have decorative fireplaces. In the center bedroom, a tiny loft is the perfect reading nook.</p>
<p>The basement includes a 10-by-15-foot bonus room and a large storage area that could contain the laundry. The house has forced-air heating, central air-conditioning and is wired for Wi-Fi. There is on-street parking.</p>
<p>The property’s Allegheny County assessed value is $120,300. Over the last two years, two single-family houses have sold in the 1500 block of Arch Street, this one for $96,053 in July 2018 and another for $155,000 in August 2018 (<a href="http://www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/Search.aspx" target="_blank">www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/Search.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>So why does every house take two years?</p>
<p>“I laugh when I see an HGTV reno show,” Ms. Johnson said. “Some of the stuff on TV is questionable. You can’t even get a permit in 30 days in the city, let alone flip a house like that.”</p>
