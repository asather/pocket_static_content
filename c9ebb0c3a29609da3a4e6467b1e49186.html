<p>HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania is asking the state’s highest court to use its extraordinary authority to take over another election-related lawsuit with critical questions that it says must be settled as soon as possible in a partisan fight between Democrats and Republicans in the presidential battleground state.</p>
<p>The suit and other cases focus on how to conduct mail-in voting in the swing state since&nbsp;state officials say they fear chaos this fall.</p>
<p>In a Sunday night filing, state lawyers asked the state Supreme Court to take over a case filed last month by the state Democratic Party and currently pending in a lower court.</p>
<p>The defendant is the top election official for Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat.</p>
<p>In many ways, the Democratic Party’s lawsuit is asking state courts to rule the opposite of what President Donald Trump’s campaign and the national Republican Party are <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/06/30/Trump-campaign-lawsuit-pennsylvania-mail-in-ballots-counties-election-boards/stories/202006300078" target="_blank">seeking in federal court in Pittsburgh</a>.</p>
<p>“These issues are unquestionably of immediate public importance,” the state attorney general’s office wrote in its 60-page filing. “Both voters and election officials need clarity on these critical election issues as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>A lawyer for the state Democratic Party, Kevin Greenberg, declined comment Monday. He has until later this week to respond to the state Supreme Court, which has a 5-2 Democratic majority.</p>
<p>The court filing comes as the Trump administration faces a public backlash over mail disruptions, after Trump frankly acknowledged that he’s starving the Postal Service of money in order to make it harder to process an expected surge of mail-in ballots, which he worries could cost him the election.</p>
<p>It also came three days after Wolf’s administration, citing a warning by the U.S. Postal Service about its delivery times, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/08/14/Pennsylvania-asks-court-extend-mail-in-voting-deadlines-2020-election/stories/202008140079" target="_blank">asked the court in a separate lawsuit</a> to extend deadlines by three days for mail-in ballots to be received in the November election. Leaders of the state House Republican majority are moving to intervene in that lawsuit.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party’s lawsuit asks for a similar extension of the deadline to count mailed-in ballots.</p>
<p>In addition, it asks the court to allow the use of satellite election offices and drop boxes — which Philadelphia and its heavily populated suburbs used in the primary to help relieve the pressure from an avalanche of mailed-in ballots.</p>
<p>It also asks the court to allow mailed-in ballots to be counted if they are returned without a secrecy envelope and to uphold the requirement in state law that poll watchers be registered voters from the county.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2020/08/17/Constraints-gone-GOP-ramps-up-effort-monitor-voting-Pennsylvania/stories/202008120137" target="_blank">Trump campaign and national Republican Party have sought the opposite</a>.</p>
<p>In a court filing in late July, the Trump campaign and national Republican Party called the state Democratic Party’s lawsuit “in large part a mirror image” of their federal court lawsuit “and a transparent attempt to forum-shop away from federal court and into this court.”</p>
<p>The federal court case is being handled by a judge who is a Trump appointee.</p>
