<p>HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania has again found a taker for a mini-casino, auctioning a license Wednesday for $10 million to a Philadelphia-area private equity investor who could build it near Penn State University’s flagship campus.</p>
<p>Ira Lubert beat one other bidder, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lubert, who helped open Valley Forge Casino Resort before selling it, was qualified to bid because he is a partner in Rivers Casino Pittsburgh. He does not have to name an exact location until he submits formal paperwork, required within six months.</p>
<p>But, under auction rules, he named the center of a 15-mile radius area — Unionville Borough in Centre County — in which he plans to locate it.</p>
<p>A possible candidate is the Nittany Mall, just outside State College.</p>
<p>The gaming board held the auction under orders from state lawmakers in a search for cash as tax collections are buffeted by economic fallout from the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The bidding is under an aggressive 2017 state law to expand gambling, including authorizing auctions of 10 mini-casino licenses that allow the holder to operate up to 750 slot machines and up to 40 table games. A casino cannot come within 40 miles of another casino location.</p>
<p>The state received bids in five auctions in 2018, but interest petered out after that.</p>
