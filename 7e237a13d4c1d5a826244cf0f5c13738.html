<h1>Steelers mailbag: Is this Chuks Okorafor's big audition?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Brian Batko’s Steelers mailbag. You’re more than welcome to email him at bbatko@post-gazette.com, tweet him @BrianBatko or slide into his DMs to inquire about the Steelers, NFL or anything out of bounds. </em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started, and don’t forget to join us on our all-sports podcast, <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="_blank">The North Shore Drive</a>, whether you use Apple, Spotify or any of the other major podcasting platforms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Steve in Dexter, Iowa:</strong> Thanks for answering our questions, Mr. Batko. I was wondering if it is possible that Chuks didn’t technically “lose” the starting RT position, but is just being held in waiting to take over the LT position next year? I’ve pondered this because Villanueva’s contract is up after this season, Chuks’ athleticism may translate better on Ben’s blind side, and we’ve been told that the RT position battle was fairly even (so to speak).</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Steve. Please. Mr. Batko is my father.</p>
<p>Let’s acknowledge that you asked this question before Monday night, when Zach Banner of course sustained a season-ending knee injury while playing right tackle. But it’s still worth exploring, because Chuks Okorafor is about to be thrown into the starting lineup and we don’t make a habit of ignoring mailbag questions from the great city of Dexter, Iowa.</p>
<p>It does seem the competition was “fairly even,” but if all things were equal, you’d have to assume the Steelers would’ve chosen the younger players, the one they drafted in the third round, the one who still has one more year left on his deal after this one. And yet, they went with Banner, which tells me he did win the job decisively in the end.</p>
<p>As for keeping Okorafor on the bench because he’s a better fit to become the left tackle next year, that wouldn’t make much sense either. If anything, you’d want him to get his feet wet with a full season of starting experience as an NFL tackle, regardless of the side. He might have more athleticism than Banner, or at least be a little lighter on his feet, but that would be just as helpful at any spot on the line.</p>
<p>Now, we’ll likely get 15 games worth, plus potentially the postseason, of Okorafor’s audition for 2021. Villanueva could perhaps play himself into another contract, but at what cost? The logical move all around would be to move on from him, getting younger and cheaper on the line in the process. We’ll see what the harsh reality may be for Banner, who was on a one-year deal. He has a long recovery ahead of him, and certainly no guarantee that he’ll be back if the Steelers target a tackle high in the draft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> The offensive line seemed to get better as the game went on in Week 1, with Banner probably getting adjusted to the speed of the game, as well as Matt Feiler becoming more comfortable at left guard. Even Stefen Wisniewski was in his first real action as a Steeler. So, that’s the good. The bad is that Villanueva gave up a sack, and he wasn’t making his first start, changing positions or joining a new team. Also, an errant low snap from Maurkice Pouncey popped up again. And then there are the injuries.</p>
<p>With Banner out, and possibly Wisniewski too, the Steelers would have to trot out a new right side of the line in Week 2. Now, if David DeCastro can make it back at right guard, that’s a ton of veteran experience injected into the equation. But if he can’t, then you’re likely going to have a fourth-round rookie in Kevin Dotson there next to a player with two career starts at right tackle. So, if your confidence level is waning, that’s not unreasonable. Depth is being tested very early.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well, I probably would have suggested former Steelers draft pick Jerald Hawkins from the Texans practice squad, and then they signed Jerald Hawkins off the Texans practice squad, which is notable because in 2020 more than any other year, there are plenty of intriguing options on practice squads, due to the expanded rosters as well as more opportunities for veterans.</p>
<p>If Hawkins is enough to shore up the situation at tackle, let’s take a look at the interior. J.C. Hassenauer is an in-house option already on the 53-man roster, but another player the team has familiarity with is Patrick Morris, who’s on Denver’s practice squad. He actually was on the active roster for a game or two last year when Maurkice Pouncey was out, but then the Broncos plucked him away.</p>
<p>There are still some free agents out there who haven’t found a team yet, such as Jared Veldheer, Cordy Glenn and Marshall Newhouse, but only Newhouse has the flexibility to play guard. And the Steelers might need flexibility more than anything, given that DeCastro should be back soon, otherwise they’d have placed him on the new shorter-term injured reserve.</p>
<p>As for trade targets, a couple former Steelers are backups around the league. Fred Johnson, last year’s undrafted free agent surprise, can play guard and tackle; he’s with Cincinnati. Chris Hubbard, or&nbsp;“Mother Hubbard” as Mike Tomlin likes to call him, is a backup in Arizona who’s also guard/tackle-capable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Only if the backups can play well enough once they get to the end of the season at 14- or 15-0.</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> It’s the sleeve, hands-down. Shades of my youth when all the cool kids (at least that’s what I told myself) were wearing the Allen Iverson arm sleeve to hoop. I think mine was made out of a sock. Anyway, Roethlisberger’s robo-sleeve is great. Can’t wait until the first time he accidentally puts it on the wrong arm.&nbsp;</p>
