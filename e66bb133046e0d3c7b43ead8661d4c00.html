<p>The defensive pair of Jack Johnson and Justin Schultz was on the ice for two goals in Saturday’s 3-2 overtime loss to the Montreal Canadiens, including Jeff Petry’s game-winner with 6:03 left in OT.</p>
<p>A day later up in Toronto, Penguins coach Mike Sullivan came to the defense of that embattled veteran duo.</p>
<p>Sullivan didn’t pin either goal on those two. Instead, he pointed to back-checking forwards who overskated those pivotal plays in Game 1 of the five-game qualifying-round series and ended up getting caught out of position. That created space for Canadiens who jumped into the fray late.</p>
<p>“The puck ended up going to the second wave or the late wave,” he said. “We’ve got to do a better job making sure we pick up that second wave of the attack.”</p>
<p>On Petry’s winner, all five Penguins were packed in below the faceoff dots. He darted into the slot and snapped a shot past Matt Murray’s blocker. With one Penguin flopping to try to block that shot and another standing in the way, Murray had to look through that crowd to try to read Petry’s release.</p>
<p>While Johnson and Schultz were both minus-2 in Game 1, the Canadiens had only one high-danger chance against that duo at 5-on-5, per Natural Stat Trick. Both defensemen were on the ice for just over 15 minutes at full strength.</p>
<p>While Sullivan was mum about potential lineup changes, it doesn’t sound like he’s ready to sit either of them in favor of Juuso Riikola or Chad Ruhwedel.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of confidence in that pair,” Sullivan said. “They’re good players.”</p>
<p><strong>Third line still a concern</strong></p>
<p>Only one of Pittsburgh’s 41 shots on goal in Game 1 came from line three.</p>
<p>Center Jared McCann and his left winger Patrick Marleau were not credited with a shot on goal. Patric Hornqvist had that trio’s lone shot at 5-on-5. They were the only line that permitted more shot attempts than they took — and it was by a wide margin. Plus, they were on the ice when Montreal made it 2-0.</p>
<p>“We would like to see just more consistent pressure from our third line,” Sullivan said. “We think that line is capable of providing some offense for us, providing momentum for us and being a sound, solid, two-way line. … As we move on here to Game 2, we’re hoping they make more of an impact on the game.”</p>
<p>So maybe Sullivan is going to give those three another shot together. If not, the coach’s lineup options include flip-flopping Hornqvist and Conor Sheary, the latter of whom skated on the top line Saturday. Or he can sit down either McCann or Marleau. Evan Rodrigues and Sam Lafferty are the top reserve forwards.</p>
<p>If Sullivan keeps the current trio intact, Marleau expressed optimism that they will eventually click. It surely didn’t help that Hornqvist missed their first week of the postseason training camp due to fear he was exposed to COVID-19.</p>
<p>“When we did get out there, I thought we did some really good things,” Marleau said. “A couple bounces here and there, we could have gotten some more chances. We’re just going to keep building and get stronger each and every game.”</p>
<p><strong>Not backing down</strong></p>
<p>Montreal boasts a solid top line centered by Phillip Danault, a top two-way NHL forward who received strong consideration for the Selke Trophy this season. With Tomas Tatar and Brendan Gallagher on his wings, they’ve presented problems for some of the NHL’s most dangerous lines.</p>
<p>The Penguins did not shy away from that matchup, though. Sidney Crosby’s top line spent much of Saturday’s loss skating against the Danault line. Crosby scored once and was a plus-1 on the night. But their Canadiens counterparts generated several scoring chances when matched up against Crosby and Co.</p>
<p>“For the most part we matched up pretty well,” Sheary said. “We looked at the chances [Sunday] and we out-chanced them pretty heavily. I think that’s a credit to things we were doing defensively and offensively. So overall it was a pretty good job. Hopefully it’s more of the same in Game 2.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Just a bad move, I guess’</strong></p>
<p>Sheary was asked about his failed penalty shot in the final minutes of regulation. He opted to shoot instead of deking Price and fired well wide of the left post.</p>
<p>“I think I had a shot in mind. I tried to do the fake shot and then release it. It kind of fumbled on me, and I obviously missed wide,” the left-shot winger said. “I’m not going to blame it on the ice. It was kind of just a bad move, I guess.”</p>
