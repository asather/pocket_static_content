<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Wilkinsburg man wanted on three outstanding warrants was arrested Thursday afternoon in McKeesport, according to the Allegheny County&nbsp;Sheriff's Office.</p>
<p>Michael Lyons, 29, had been wanted since December of last year on two arrest warrants for simple assault and a bench warrant for violation of probation/parole from a 2013 guilty plea of conspiracy,&nbsp;which included third-degree murder and a firearms violation. Lyons was placed on the sheriff’s&nbsp;“Most Wanted” list on July 20, officials said.</p>
<p>Sheriff’s deputies said they were able to arrest Lyons after discovering he was staying with a friend in the 2900 block of Grover Street on Thursday. Police went to the house and were met at the door by his friend. Lyons was inside the home, police said, and he was taken into custody around 1:30 p.m. without incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is being held at the Allegheny County Jail. A preliminary hearing is set for Sept. 10 before Magisterial District Judge Kim&nbsp;Marie Hoots, court dockets show.</p>
<p>Lyons was initially placed on probation/parole after pleading guilty following an incident in March 2013, where he and two other men assaulted a man on a party bus in the West End, the county sheriff’s office said. They dragged the man from the bus and shot him several times.</p>
<p>Police said in December 2019 Lyons had gone to pick up his child from his ex-girlfriend when they got into a physical fight. He also allegedly struck his ex-girlfriend’s friend, who was present, and took his ex-girlfriend’s phone in the altercation.</p>
<p>Lyons was charged with criminal trespassing, theft by unlawful taking, harassment, and disorderly conduct in that incident.</p>
<p>In July, he had another altercation with the same ex-girlfriend. He allegedly wrestled and punched the pregnant woman over a Playstation game console. He was charged with criminal trespassing, theft by unlawful taking, harassment, and disorderly conduct.</p>
