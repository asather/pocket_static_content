<h1>Braddock Hills veteran remembered as true American hero</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>To this day, the Belgium government sends a box of its signature chocolates to the Braddock Hills home of Sandra Uram as a token of appreciation for what her uncle did 75 years ago.</p>
<p>The gesture speaks to the legacy of the late Leonard Alfred Funk Jr., a Medal of Honor recipient from the 82nd Airborne Division who is the most decorated paratrooper in history and one of the most acclaimed soldiers of World War II. His numerous awards include honorary Belgian knighthood.</p>
<p>“The chocolates arrive every year at Christmas. They still remember him over there,” Mrs. Uram said. “We’re all so proud of Uncle Leonard. He was just a little guy, small in stature, but he was mighty.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Sgt. Funk is listed at 5-foot-5 on the website of Arlington National Cemetery, where he was buried following his death in 1992 at the age of 76. Yet he is lionized as a giant by the world’s toughest fighters.</p>
<p>Sgt. Funk is enshrined in the 82nd Airborne’s Hall of Heroes at Fort Bragg, N.C., where a gymnasium used by current paratroopers bears his name. The Western Pennsylvania chapter of the 82nd Airborne Division Association is also named for him, and his hometown of Braddock Hills erected a monument to him.</p>
<p>Carved into the granite slab are his deeds and his military awards. When viewed at an angle, the stone also reveals Sgt. Funk’s image.</p>
<p>“He’s an authentic American hero, but he never flaunted it,” said Robert Henkel, who served on borough council when the Funk monument was dedicated. “You wonder how many people today know what he did to protect our freedom. His story is one that should be taught in schools.”</p>
<p>Although his deeds are the stuff that inspire filmmakers, Sgt. Funk balked at the notion of a movie. Those in his inner circle like to say that the Airborne makes history, not movies</p>
<p>Sgt. Funk was born Aug. 17, 1916, to a German father and a French mother in one of the cluster of communities carved out of Braddock Township east of Pittsburgh. His mother died in the flu pandemic of 1918, and his father never recovered from her loss. Relatives and friends helped raise Sgt. Funk and a younger brother, William.</p>
<p>Sgt. Funk was already in uniform when the Army asked for volunteers willing to parachute into battle, even if it meant dropping behind enemy lines. Sgt. Funk stepped forward, his status as a paratrooper earning him an extra $50 a month in jump pay.</p>
<p>He served in Charlie Company of the 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment when it became part of the All Americans of 82nd Airborne Division prior to the D-Day invasion of 1944.</p>
<p>One man who knows the story from there is William Priatko. Although separated by 15 years and a big difference in size, both Sgt. Funk and Mr. Priatko played football at the now-defunct Scott High School in North Braddock. Mr. Priatko, of North Huntingdon, also played football for the University of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
<p>“He was a feisty little guy. I’ll always have that picture of him as a bantam rooster,” said Mr. Priatko, an Air Force veteran who had two sons graduate from West Point. “I had so much respect for him. He was the epitome of the American soldier. I know he’s an idol in the 82nd Airborne and rightfully so. What those guys did was so commendable.”</p>
<p>Mr.. Priatko and two brothers who were veterans of World War II brought Sgt. Funk along when they drove to West Point to attend a football game in 1983.</p>
<p>“He told us the story of the Medal of Honor. When you’re among friends and with other veterans, you can let your hair down a little bit and open up. He said he got it for what he did in Belgium, but that wasn’t the toughest scrape he was in,” Mr. Priatko recalled.</p>
<p>Before the amphibious landings on D-Day, Sgt. Funk jumped into France at night and under fire. His objective was Sainte-Mere-Eglise, but he was dropped at least 20 miles away. One account put it at double that distance. For perspective, if his drop zone was Pittsburgh, he hit the ground in Latrobe.</p>
<p>“Half of our guys were dead before they hit the ground,” he told Mr. Priatko.</p>
<p>Despite a sprained ankle, Sgt. Funk led the survivors on a three-week fight through German lines to reach a U.S. unit. As long as he had a functioning weapon and trigger finger, Sgt. Funk said he would never surrender. For his actions, he received the Silver Star, the nation’s third-highest award for valor.</p>
<p>In September 1944, Sgt. Funk parachuted into Holland as part of Operation Market Garden, which was hatched to secure bridges over the Rhine River. He led three men against seven German anti-aircraft guns poised to pour murderous fire into incoming gliders, eliminating 20 enemy during the assault. Sgt. Funk received the Distinguished Service Cross, the country’s second-highest award for valor.</p>
<p>Then came the Battle of the Bulge. After the last German offensive of the war was blunted, the Airborne counterattacked against Hitler’s army when a gunfight within a battle erupted on Jan. 29, 1945, in Holzheim, Belgium.</p>
<p>Sgt. Funk had cobbled together a platoon of clerks to take on a German garrison. The platoon and other units captured 80 Germans. Sgt. Funk posted four soldiers as guards while he and the clerks resumed their attack.</p>
<p>At one point, Sgt. Funk and another soldier returned to check on things. But in the shifting tides of battle, a squad of 20 German soldiers had entered the town, freed the prisoners and prepared to attack Sgt. Funk’s unit from the rear.</p>
<p>“I had my weapon on my shoulder, came around a corner and boom! A German officer stuck his weapon into my stomach,” Sgt. Funk told Mr. Priatko. “He spoke some English and said, ‘Disarm!’”</p>
<p>Surrender was not in his creed, but the odds were against him.</p>
<p>“I figured I was a-goner. I thought I’d never see Braddock Hills again,” Sgt. Funk told Priatko. “I felt that if I was going to get it, I’m going to take as many of them with me as I could.”</p>
<p>The way the family heard the story, Sgt. Funk muttered, “Surrender, hell.” According to his niece Sandy Uram, “He said he’d die before he gave up. Then he let them have it.”</p>
<p>As Sgt. Funk pretended to comply, he whipped his Thompson submachine gun into a firing position and emptied the 30-round magazine into his would-be captor. While reloading, he ordered the other Americans to join the fray.</p>
<p>Within 60 seconds, 21 Germans were dead and 24 were wounded. The paratrooper with Sgt. Funk was also killed. The surviving Germans were recaptured.</p>
<p>Sgt. Funk was awarded the Medal of Honor, which was presented by President Harry Truman in September 1945.</p>
<p>During that West Point weekend, Sgt. Funk was lavished with VIP treatment. The highlight came at the Saturday football game.</p>
<p>“We were in the stands, and during a break in the action, the public address announcer says, ‘We would like you to please rise and honor in our midst the recipient of the Medal of Honor, Leonard Funk.’ There were 48,000 people giving him a standing ovation. He had tears in his eyes,” Mr. Priatko recalled.</p>
<p>To keep his legacy alive, veterans of the 82nd Airborne from any era, or anyone who served on jump status in the U.S. Army, are welcome to join the Leonard Funk Chapter. Contact chapter chairman Tom Riley at tomriley1951@gmail.com or at 412-366-2399.</p>
