<p>President Donald Trump will deliver his <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/02/03/National-briefs-Democrats-Republicans-Trump-State-of-the-Union/stories/202002040072" target="_blank">State of the Union address</a> Tuesday evening, less than 24 hours before the Senate is expected to vote to acquit Mr. Trump on two articles of impeachment.</p>
<p>The president will begin his speech at 9 p.m. EST, and conclude his remarks around 10:30 p.m. Several networks will broadcast <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/02/04/President-Trump-State-Of-The-Union-Congress-guests-GM-Lordstown-veterans/stories/202002040061" target="_blank">the SOTU</a>, including ABC News, CBS, C-SPAN, Fox, and NBC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?468549-1/2020-state-union-address" target="_blank">C-SPAN</a> will host a live stream on it’s website. Each network also will stream the speech live on their mobile applications.</p>
<p>Those who don’t have a cable provider can find the address live streaming on YouTube through ABC News, CBS and PBS.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are expecting Mr. Trump to tout his accomplishments throughout the speech, although a senior administration official declined to comment Friday on whether or not the president will mention impeachment during his speech. Instead, he expected to highlight the new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, as well as his trade policy with China.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump becomes the second president to address the nation in the midst of his presidency being decided by the Senate. President Bill Clinton was in a similar situation when he delivered his State of the Union address in February 1999.</p>
<p>Hours before his speech Tuesday, the president <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/02/04/Trump-Revels-in-Democratic-Dysfunction-iowa-caucuses-app-coding-problem/stories/202002040090" target="_blank">bashed the Democratic Caucus in Iowa</a> after the party struggled to count votes and delayed results of the presidential nomination contest, calling the incident “an unmitigated disaster.”</p>
