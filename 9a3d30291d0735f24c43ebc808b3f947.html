<h1>Emsworth company closes, leaving 61 people jobless. Coraopolis call center also furloughs workers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Emsworth polishing and finishing product company is closing, nearly a year after being sold to a larger company.</p>
<p>Schaffner Manufacturing Co. Inc. notified the state Department of Labor &amp; Industry that it was closing Feb. 28, permanently furloughing 61 employees. Schaffner, which was founded more than 70 years ago, was acquired by Milwaukee, Wisc.-based Jason Industries Inc. for $11 million in April 2019.</p>
<p>Schaffner developed specialized products, including buffing wheels and compounds, for use in a variety of industries. Schaffner’s annual sales were valued at $11 million at the time of the acquisition by Jason.</p>
<p>Schaffner officials were not immediately available for comment Friday.</p>
<p>Separately, Coraopolis-based call center IBEX notified the state that it was furloughing 147 employees by March 31. IBEX, which is based in Washington, D.C., said the pending loss of two clients prompted the layoff. IBEX’s total employment in Coraopolis is 242 people.</p>
