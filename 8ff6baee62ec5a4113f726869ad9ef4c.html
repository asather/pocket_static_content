<h1>488 cats frolic in virtual Cat Film Fest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What the world needs now, in a time when everyone is supposed to be 6 feet apart, is cats. Lots and lots of cats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The loving owners of 1,300 cats submitted videos of their felines doing cute and crazy things. Brian Mendelssohn, owner and operator of Row House Cinema in Lawrenceville, spent three weeks watching and editing 80 hours of cat videos and picked out 488 who star in the 2020 Quarantine Cat Film Festival.</p>
<p>Previews provided by Mr. Mendelssohn had me smiling from beginning to end. There were bottle-fed purring kittens, big cats&nbsp;making death-defying leaps through the air, a cat climbing a ladder, and another using the drum of a clothes dryer as an exercise treadmill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cats come in all shapes, colors and breeds, including Siamese and other exotic purebreds. From what I’ve seen, domestic shorthairs rule, numerically. Videos were sent from all over the world, but 25% of the submissions came from Pittsburgh, so local cat lovers may see a cat they know.</p>
<p>“Cats are saving independent movie theaters,” said Mr. Mendelssohn. The video will be&nbsp;“shown” in 100 theaters across the country. You buy your $12 ticket online, from the theater near you, then you watch the film fest in the comfort of your own home. Invite your cats to watch with you. The video includes shots of felines watching cartoons and movies in their own homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://rowhouse.online/" target="_blank">rowhouse.online</a> to buy a ticket, see a trailer called a “purr-eview,” a sneak preview and photos of some of the festival cats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The website calls this&nbsp;“The most purr-fect, a-meow-zing and totally fur-tastic cat videos anyone has ever seen.”</p>
