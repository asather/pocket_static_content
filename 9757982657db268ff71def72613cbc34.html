<h1>Pittsburgh police contract award followed hard bargaining</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A week-old contract arbitration award panned by Fraternal Order of Police leadership came only after negotiations in which the union fought to catch up with other departments, while the city of Pittsburgh flexed beyond its initial position — but ultimately not far enough to reach a deal, according to accounts of the bargaining that emerged this week.</p>
<p>Differences over pensions may have ultimately torpedoed negotiations between the city and FOP Fort Pitt Lodge 1, setting the stage for the Jan. 10 arbitrator’s decision in which&nbsp;“the city won astronomically,” according to union president&nbsp;Robert Swartzwelder.</p>
<p><a title="Arbitration decision story" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/01/10/Pittsburgh-police-arbitration-decision-awarded-Swartzwelder-Peduto/stories/202001100103" target="_blank">The binding decision, which governs the pay and benefits of some 980 officers</a>, sergeants and lieutenants, is likely to remain contentious, as the FOP looks to challenge it, and Mayor Bill Peduto’s administration works with city council to solidify it into an amended budget.</p>
<p>Council has no power to void an arbitration decision, but may nonetheless face pressure to improve a package that the FOP decries as unfair.</p>
<p>“Obviously, we’re hearing from officers as well as constituents that are concerned about the arbitration,” said Councilman Corey O’Connor, who chairs council’s Public Safety Committee. “We’re just fact-finding about the whole process, how it went down. Legally, I don’t think we can do anything” to counter the award.</p>
<p>In 2018, the city started with a proposal of 3% raises annually for five years.</p>
<p>“We entered negotiations with the FOP realizing that these officers had done a significant amount of work under difficult financial circumstances for the city, and looking to hopefully reach a deal that the city could financially afford and that the union felt was appropriate for their workers,” said city chief of staff Dan Gilman. But the city’s initial offer was constrained, he said, by a reality:&nbsp;“$27 million is the amount of money the city had set aside to enter negotiations” without busting budgets.</p>
<p>The FOP pushed for a three-year contract, including 7% raises each year, to make up for 14 years of austerity when the city was under state Act 47 oversight for distressed municipalities.</p>
<p>The union presented data showing that Pittsburgh officers earned around 10% less than an average of their peers in 11 other mid-sized cities. Among Pennsylvania's 10 biggest city departments, Pittsburgh's officers ranked in the bottom three in base pay, longevity and holiday pay — along with Scranton and Reading.</p>
<p>“We’re at the bottom of the pay scale with similar cities with similar policing requirements,” said Officer Swartzwelder.&nbsp;The proposed raises “would put us in the ballpark” and would roughly make up for his members’ loss of earning power, compared to inflation, during the Act 47 years, he said.</p>
<p>Police weren’t asking for anything like the&nbsp;first-year raises of around 8% won by firefighters in arbitration, and 17% negotiated by the city’s medics (offset in part by reducing overtime spending).</p>
<p>Positions became, briefly, more flexible as the two sides discussed pacts in which the FOP would drop ongoing legal attempts to reopen or invalidate prior contracts.</p>
<p>The city in December 2018 made what it called a “best and final five-year offer” with raises of 5% the first year, 4% the second, and 3% in the third, fourth and fifth. It also offered to increase uniform allowances, city contributions toward retiree medical care, and longevity pay, which rises with the officer’s years of service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city argued that the various sweeteners would add $40 million, or even $55 million, to its spending on police over five years, according to a letter from the city Law Department to Officer Swartzwelder, dated in December 2018.</p>
<p>Officer Swartzwelder said that when it came time to negotiate the details, city officials said, “that’s too rich” or “we don’t really have that money.”</p>
<p>Declining to discuss specifics of negotiations, Mr. Gilman said the city&nbsp;“worked hard to be flexible and find every way possible to stretch every dollar to propose and counter-propose contracts that we thought would be amenable to the FOP membership.”</p>
<p>The Law Department’s letter indicates that the FOP “rejected the city’s offer because it did not include the FOP’s proposed $31.5 million pension enhancement” which the city “cannot afford.”</p>
<p>Right now, when city officers retire, pension is based on half of their average base and longevity pay —&nbsp;not overtime or secondary employment — over the last three years of their employment. City police don’t get Social Security, so some retire on less than half of their earnings during their working years.</p>
<p>Medics, by contrast, get pensions and Social Security. Firefighters get no Social Security, but their pension calculation includes overtime.</p>
<p>The FOP proposed that officers who stay for 25 years get pensions based on 62.5% of those earnings, and 30-year veterans get 75%. To offset costs, married officers would contribute 7.5% of their earnings to the pension fund, and single officers 7% — increases from 6.5% and 6% now.</p>
<p>The FOP’s experts disputed the city’s cost figures, calculating that the combination of richer benefits and higher contributions would only minimally affect the city’s pension funding level.</p>
<p>The city, though, resisted any tampering with a pension pool that had long been its financial Achilles heel, and that is still underfunded.</p>
<p>“We have sensitivity to guaranteeing that those employees who have come before us, who were promised a pension, will have those dollars paid out to them as they were promised,” said Mr. Gilman. “And we have a sensitivity to not going back to a financial situation where the mayor ever has to look an employee in the eye and tell them that they’re being laid off or their salaries frozen.”</p>
<p>The city then made two-year and three-year contract proposals, with raises of 4% or 3% a year. But the bargaining broke down and the matter went to arbitration.</p>
<p>Neutral arbitrator Robert Creo crafted a four-year award that gives officers a series of raises of 1%, 2% or 3%, spaced three or six months apart, the first backdated to Jan. 1, 2019, and extending through 2022. Mr. Peduto has said it amounts to a 16% increase over four years, but Officer Swartzwelder said the phasing means less money for the officers.</p>
<p>Officers now get six weeks of paid parental leave, a new benefit for them. But there's no pension increase.</p>
<p>There’s one other financial plum for officers, but the city isn’t paying it. Police working details for private businesses, which can hire officers through the bureau, used to get paid time and a half. Now many will get time and a half plus 14%.</p>
<p>That, said Officer Swartzwelder, “incentivizes secondary employment rather than working for the city in an overtime capacity.”</p>
<p>Mr. Gilman said the department of around 1,000 — versus 857 when Mr. Peduto took office six years ago — has the staffing to meet city needs.</p>
<p>The FOP president concludes that Mr. Creo inappropriately crafted his offer to fit within the city’s proposed $27 million cap. “I truly believe it’s the same,” he said.</p>
<p>“The mayor deeply values the work of the men and women of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police,” said Mr. Gilman,&nbsp;“which is why we negotiated in good faith to try to reach an agreement that we thought the city could afford and would pay them the total package that they work hard for.”</p>
