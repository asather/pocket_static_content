<h1>Pirates payroll drops to $50 million after Starling Marte trade</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On opening day 2016, the beginning of the end of the Pirates' window of competition, they had a payroll of $98.8 million. They’d increased their spending on their major league roster every year since 2010 and almost tripled the amount of money spent on player salaries.</p>
<p>Four years later, their opening day payroll projects to be about half that.</p>
<p>Monday's trade of Starling Marte to the Arizona Diamondbacks removed $11.5 million from the 2020 payroll. The Pirates are sending $1.5 million to Arizona in the deal, but they are projected to spend only about $50 million for the salaries of players currently on their 40-man roster.</p>
<p>That figure does not include Felipe Vazquez’s $5.25 million salary. Vazquez, who faces charges of computer pornography, solicitation of a child and providing obscene materials to minors, will go back on baseball’s restricted list, meaning he won’t receive his salary.</p>
<p>“[Marte’s] salary … will re-allocated back into the team,” general manager Ben Cherington said at a press conference Monday. “That could happen in 2020, it could happen past that. We need to look opportunistically, and when is the best time to put that money back into the team? That will be done strictly through the lens of what gives us the best chance to win.”</p>
<p>The Pirates’ recent record of reinvesting saved money has been spotty. They used money saved by trading Charlie Morton to sign Ivan Nova, but money saved by trading Nova was used to cover Jung Ho Kang, Jordan Lyles and Lonnie Chisenhall, who were already either signed or in agreement at the time of the trade. Before the 2018 season, they went a whole winter without signing a single free agent. Remember how much George Kontos had left on his contract when the Pirates claimed him off waivers in August 2017? (About $600,000.) Remember how much money Juan Nicasio had left on his deal when the Pirates put him on irrevocable waivers later that month, losing him to the Philadelphia Phillies, who traded him to St. Louis, where he closed games against the Pirates the following week? (About $600,000.)</p>
<p>That all happened before Cherington took over, and spending for spending’s sake won’t do the Pirates, who aren't in a position to contend in 2020, any good. What we don’t yet know is whether principal owner Bob Nutting’s willingness to spend on the major league payroll will change under a new front office, especially after years of attendance decline.</p>
<p>“It’s a core issue and one we’re spending time working on,” Nutting told the Post-Gazette last week. “I think what we want to make sure is when we have an opportunity to really put the foot on the gas, we’re able to do it. I think it’s important that we don’t rush.”</p>
