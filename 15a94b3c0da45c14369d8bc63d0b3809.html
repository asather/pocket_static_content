<h1>Finding the graves of prominent African-Americans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Black History Month is the time when all Americans take a moment to reflect on African-Americans’ contributions to the struggle for civil rights, the arts, sports and entertainment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way to honor these pioneers is to visit the places they now call home.&nbsp;A pilgrimage to the grave sites of some of the prominent figures from black history is easy for Western Pennsylvanians.</p>
<p>Two of America’s most famous abolitionists — Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass — lie in western New York, a five-hour drive. When she died in 1913 at the age of 91, Tubman was laid to rest in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, N.Y.&nbsp;Douglass (1818-1895) is buried in Mt. Hope Cemetery in Rochester, and John Brown (1800-1859) lies at the John Brown Farm State Historic Site in North Elba, near Lake Placid, N.Y.</p>
<p>Laurence Glasco, an associate professor of history at the University of Pittsburgh, said it’s no coincidence that the three abolitionists’ ended up in upstate New York.</p>
<p>“That area was the backbone of the evangelical abolitionist movement,” he said.&nbsp;“They believed you can’t go to heaven as a slave owner. African-Americans found opportunities there that they couldn’t have in other parts of the country. They lived there and died there.”</p>
<p>Many other prominent African-Americans began their journey in Western Pennsylvania and ended up there, too.</p>
<p>Consider these famous residents of Homewood Cemetery: jazz pianist and composer Erroll Garner (1921–1977), jazz pianist Walt Harper (1926–2006), Pittsburgh Courier photographer Teenie Harris (1908–1998), songwriter Churchill Kohlman (1906–1983), basketball player Chuck Cooper (1926–1984), civil rights activist Daisy Adams Lampkin (1883–1965) and Pittsburgh publisher and editor Robert Lee Vann (1879–1940).</p>
<p>Allegheny Cemetery also has an impressive list of hometown heroes: hall of fame baseball slugger Josh Gibson (1911–1947), numbers banker and Negro League owner Gus Greenlee (1893–1952), jazz saxophonist Stanley Turrentine (1934–2000), 15-term state Rep. K. Leroy Irvis (1919-2006) and abolitionists Lewis Woodson (1806-1878) and John C. Peck (1802-1875).</p>
<p>Marlene Bransom of Mount Washington, an African-American genealogist from Greene County, said many African-Americans chose to be buried with family members. Those who migrated north to work in Western Pennsylvania coal mines or steel mills would sometimes go home to family graves in North Carolina, South Carolina or Virginia. But shipping bodies was expensive, and many were laid to rest in the black sections of mostly white cemeteries or African-American-owned cemeteries such as Lincoln Memorial in the Hill District. After one family member was buried there, others followed.</p>
<p>In the late 1930s, before the public housing project known as Bedford Dwellings was built, Lincoln Memorial Cemetery’s graves were dug up and the bodies reburied in Woodlawn Cemetery in Wilkinsburg. But Ms. Bransom doesn’t believe all were moved.</p>
<p>“One hundred people were supposedly buried in a section about 14 feet across going down the hillside,” she said.&nbsp;“No way there are a hundred there.”</p>
<p>At least 200 marked graves were in Lincoln Memorial Cemetery, according to a November 1938 article in the Pittsburgh Press. Hill District residents were upset that the Pittsburgh Housing Authority dug up graves with a steam shovel, put the remains in new boxes and sent them to Woodlawn Cemetery.</p>

<p>“A steam shovel has no business in a cemetery, diggin’ and snortin’ around the graves of our loved ones,” one “aged Negro” told a Press reporter.</p>
<p>He said people who could afford it paid workmen to dig up their relatives’ remains by hand. Others tried to do it themselves but were blocked by security guards.</p>
<p>Some residents believed as many as 2,000 people were buried in Lincoln Memorial, including Ajax Jones, a wealthy African-American property owner who got his start as a messenger boy in the mayor’s office and later was a police commissioner on the South Side.</p>
<p>August Wilson, the Pulitzer prize-winning playwright who grew up in the Hill District, was living in Seattle when he died in 2005. He now lies in&nbsp;Greenwood Cemetery in O’Hara, near the graves of his mother and grandmother.</p>
<p>“He wanted to be close to his mother,” Mr. Glasco said.</p>
