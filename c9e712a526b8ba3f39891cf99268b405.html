<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County health officials reported Saturday that a third person has died from COVID-19 and the confirmed number of cases has risen to 552, up 76 cases from the preceding day.</p>
<p>The latest death was an individual in their 90s who had been hospitalized. No further information was available.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, deaths in Beaver County tripled from two to six and more than doubled in Lawrence County, from two to five, the Pennsylvania Department of Health reported Saturday. One of the newly reported Beaver County deaths had actually been reported Wednesday by a nursing home where two others had died, but that had not been reflected in state figures as of Friday.</p>
<p>Deaths remained at two in Butler County and one in Fayette County.</p>
<p>Statewide, health officials said Saturday the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases surpassed 10,000 for the first time, rising in one day by 1,597 from 8,420 to 10,017 cases. Reported deaths in the state increased by 34 —&nbsp;or 75 percent.—&nbsp;from 102 to 136, according to state health officials.</p>
<p>Allegheny County health officials said that of those 552 cases of the viral disease, a total of 86 people have needed hospitalization, past or present. That was an increase of eight hospitalizations from Friday’s reported numbers.</p>
