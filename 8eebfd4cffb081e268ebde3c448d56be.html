<h1>Downtown Pittsburgh sinkhole that ate a bus is finally repaired</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Downtown Pittsburgh sinkhole that ate a bus — and inspired everything from Halloween costumes to Christmas ornaments to cupcake design — has finally been repaired.</p>
<p>It took nearly&nbsp;nearly a year, tons of material and several hundred thousand dollars, but the city said Thursday that utilities and its crews finally finished repairing the 18-foot-deep hole that opened Oct. 28 and 10th Street has reopened to traffic. The 60-by-35-foot hole opened while a Port Authority bus was stopped at a traffic light and the rear of the bus fell into the hole.</p>
<p>No one was injured, but the incident kicked off a major repair effort that involved six utilities that had damage to underground facilities. The city and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority split the public cost of $344,000, but it is unknown how much more the utilities paid for their work.</p>
<p>When the incident occurred, the city had hoped to have the street reopened within a few weeks. But utilities discovered serious problems&nbsp;under ground that had to be addressed while the street was open and that work was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Almost before the partially submerged bus could be removed merchants began using the image to decorate wine glasses, ornaments and T-shirts. Oakmont Bakery topped its cupcakes with a bus pointing skyward and at least one woman had it tattooed to her arm. And with the street collapse coming just before Halloween, it inspired a variety of homemade costumes.</p>
<p>The utilities that worked at the site included the water and sewer authority, Duquesne Light, Peoples Gas, Comcast, Verizon and Pittsburgh-Allegheny County Thermal, which runs a steam heating system for a series of buildings Downtown. The utility work included:</p>
<p>• Duquesne Light improving the street grid and replacing terra cotta conduit run between 3 manholes with new PVC ducts encased in reinforced concrete.</p>
<p>• Peoples Gas conducting a complete safety check and performed corrosion protection work on their existing steel pipeline.</p>
<p>• Comcast replacing conduit at the site and protecting their fiber optic system, which was secured during street restoration. Verizon secured and repaired its lines as well.</p>
<p>• Pittsburgh-Allegheny County Thermal removing water and soil from steam tunnels to clean and sanitize them; removing damaged concrete; repairing pipe supports and concrete anchors; and reinsulating the main steam line that sustained water damage or needed to be removed to make concrete and support repairs.</p>
<p>• PWSA clearing about 2,500 tons of debris from the 48-inch sewer running down 10th street to the Allegheny River outfall point, which included using a suction machine sitting on a river barge and a diver to remove debris from the river bed. The agency also installed a new bulkhead for a damaged manhole and finished the street repairs.</p>
<p>In all, public crews worked more than 1,100 hours on the project and used 746 tons of stone backfill to the sinkhole; poured about 395 tons of concrete; and replaced 2,097 square feet of bricks on the street.</p>
<p>In a news release, May Bill Peduto praised the work.</p>
<p>“This has been an incredibly challenging year for our city, nation and planet, and the 10th Street sinkhole represented everything 2020 has been about — danger, disruption and frustration, but ultimately solutions, due to a lot of hard work by people working together. I can’t thank our partners, and especially our Downtown residents and businesses, enough for their patience and understanding,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
