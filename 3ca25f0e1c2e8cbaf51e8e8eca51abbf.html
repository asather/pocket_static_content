<h1>Beleaguered Port Authority eligible for up to $141 million in reimbursements due to COVID-19 losses</h1>

<p>The $25 billion federal stimulus package for public transit agencies can’t come soon enough for Port Authority: The agency is projecting revenue losses and added expenses from the COVID-19 emergency to reach $30 million by June 30.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation released figures Friday that show the local agency will be eligible for $141.75 million in reimbursements for expenses related to the virus. Agencies in neighboring counties also will be eligible for federal help due to dramatic losses in passenger revenue and increased cleaning costs for a total of $162.1 million administered by the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission.</p>
<p>Port Authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said the agency’s ridership was down 84% on March 31. It also is spending an extra $200,000 a week for cleaning supplies and overtime for employees who are sanitizing buses and stations every day instead of monthly.</p>
<p>“It cannot be said enough how this is going to be an absolute life-saver,” Mr. Brandolph said. “The fact our local legislators thought about and acted on the state of public transit is impressive.</p>
<p>“That has to show how dramatic the impact has been on public transit.”</p>

<p>The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority is projecting a $150 million deficit by June 30 as a result of the virus emergency. The Philadelphia region, which includes Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, is eligible for more than $879 million in reimbursements.</p>
<p>Across Pennsylvania, transit agencies are eligible for $1.13 billion in reimbursements, including $80.6 million in rural areas that will be administered by the state.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said Port Authority has been buying sanitizer “by the barrel” and recently purchased machines known as “foggers” to help sanitize buses. It has cut service by about 25%, but it may have to add some trips on select routes so customers can use social distancing and avoid close contact with others.</p>
<p>As a result, Port Authority is experiencing lost revenue from fares and advertising and added expenses totaling about $6.5 million a month.</p>
<p>“You can just see how quickly it adds up,” Mr. Brandolph said. “Obviously, when you are an agency as large as we are, that’s what’s going to happen.”</p>
<p>The decline in ridership, pushed by Gov. Tom Wolf’s decision to order all nonessential businesses to close and people to stay at home except to buy necessities, go to work and exercise, is unprecedented. Port Authority gets about 20% of its revenue through fares.</p>
<p>“Public transit in Western Pennsylvania hasn’t seen this kind of slide since the steel industry collapse,” Mr. Brandolph said. “That was a slower slide over a long period of time. This is an 80% decrease in a matter of weeks.”</p>
<p>At this point, when pubic health officials say the virus emergency hasn’t peaked yet, it’s impossible to say how long the financial crisis will last. With the economy collapsing, the agency could see future problems receiving state and local funds generated by sales and alcohol taxes, respectively.</p>
<p>And ridership isn’t likely to return to February levels all at once after the pandemic eases.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of variables here. We don’t know how long this is going to last,” Mr. Brandolph said. “There are certainly going to be long-term losses the further we go out. We’re going to deal with it as we go along.”</p>
<p>Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and other local transit agencies are experiencing the same types of losses.</p>
<p>SEPTA spokeswoman Carla Showell-Lee said the agency has lost about 77% of ridership on its transit system and 96% on its regional rail service. The agency’s proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 projects $540 million in fares, and if that is off by 25% — which Ms. Showell-Lee said is a conservative estimate — the agency would lose another $135 million to $150 million.</p>
<p>“There will not be an immediate return to normal after the crisis,” she said. “Workers will not all come back at once, and many will still be experiencing unemployment and dealing with the overall economic impact.</p>
<p>“Also we have to look at how possible changes in rider behavior could impact transit. For example, if practices such as social distancing need to continue, SEPTA has to determine what that will mean for the service we provide.”</p>
<p>Transit agencies in Beaver ($4.3 million), Washington ($3.9 million), Westmoreland ($7.3 million), Butler ($901,873) and Fayette ($114,072) counties all can seek reimbursement for virus expenditures and losses. So, too, can the Airport Corridor Transportation Association ($231,377), which helps commuters move in the business corridor around Pittsburgh International Airport.</p>
<p>Legislators wrote the stimulus to make it as easy as possible for transit agencies to be reimbursed. Eligible costs include such items as lost fare revenue, cleaning supplies, payroll for drivers sent home due to service cuts.</p>
<p>Agencies will incur expenses then submit bills to draw down on the stimulus funds.</p>
<p>Initially, the American Public Transportation Association asked for $20 billion nationally.</p>
<p>“We had surveyed our transit agencies and saw the deteriorating conditions across the country,” said Ward McCarragher, the association’s vice president of governments affairs and advocacy. “As time went by, we requested the highest amount we could.</p>
<p>“It’s going to make a big difference.”</p>
<p>If the crisis continues and the money runs out, Mr. McCarragher said, the association will need more.</p>
