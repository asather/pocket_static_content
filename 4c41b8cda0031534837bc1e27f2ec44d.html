<h1>Millvale probes alleged vulgar comments by police chief</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Millvale has concluded an internal investigation into allegations that the police chief made vulgar comments about a female officer while in the presence of her colleagues and then offered her a promotion if she let the matter drop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The allegations were contained in an undated, anonymous letter typed on police department letterhead stationery. It was purportedly written on behalf of concerned officers, although part of it refers to “I” and “me,” making it appear that the female officer might have been involved in drafting it.</p>
<p>The letter alleged that in September, Chief Tim Komoroski was in the squad room when he made crude sexual references about the female officer while in the presence of at least three other officers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“All officers of this department have heard the chief make many questionable and inappropriate comments in the past and feel as if it was time to report it,” stated the letter, which was addressed to Mayor Brian Spoales and Manager Ed Figas.</p>
<p>The department comprises five full-time officers, a chief and a deputy chief.</p>
<p>The letter claims that the mayor learned of the alleged incident at an “informal meeting,” during which he took notes and “did ensure us that he would address the issues.” That was followed by an Oct. 10 meeting between the mayor and police chief, the letter said. When the mayor told the chief about the allegations, according to the letter, the chief got angry and left the meeting.</p>
<p>A second incident mentioned in the letter was alleged to have occurred in October. The letter claims that the chief called the female officer to talk about the allegation.</p>
<p>“Chief began the conversation by stating he does not remember making such a comment but then began saying, ‘I’m sorry,’ “ the letter said.</p>
<p>“He went on to state that if I went forward with the allegations regarding the comment then he would lose his health insurance...” and referred to his wife’s health problems, the letter said. “He then continued saying, ‘I’m sorry but I don’t remember saying that.’ It was then the Chief stated to me,” You could have a supervisor’s position tomorrow if this does not continue.”</p>
<p>The conversation ended a short time later, according to the letter, which concluded: “We the officers of the department are deeply upset and appalled by the conduct of Chief Komoroski regarding this incident and wish to submit this letter as our formal complaint.”</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the borough corroborated the allegations or what actions, if any, it has taken. The female officer did not respond to multiple efforts to contact her.</p>
<p>The mayor said Friday there was a possibility that someone could face discipline over the matter — pending a recommendation by the solicitor and a vote by council.</p>
<p>“There’s some things that may have to take place,” Mr. Spoales said, “maybe discipline after we look at it and it goes to council.” He declined to specify who might face discipline or the time frame for a decision.</p>
<p>The mayor said he had&nbsp;“100%” confidence in both Chief Komoroski and the department. Asked whether there was any friction between the chief and his officers, Mr. Spoales said,&nbsp;“There’s always going to be friction with your boss somewhere along the line.”</p>
<p>Chief Komoroski declined comment. The borough manager referred inquiries to the solicitor, who declined to provide details because the issue pertains to personnel.</p>
<p>“Obviously, I can’t make a lot of comments because it’s a personnel matter,” Solicitor John F. Cambest said last week. “I can tell you that we did receive a letter, that we’ve done an internal investigation, and we’re taking whatever appropriate personnel action needs to be taken.”</p>
<p>Mr. Cambest said that he could not discuss whether any discipline was imposed. He said that no one was demoted or fired as a result of the inquiry. The status of both the chief and the female officer remain unchanged, and both remain on active duty.</p>
