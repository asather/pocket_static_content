<h1>Five things to know about the Penguins' four opponents this week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The Penguins will get four chances to get back on track this week when they face Ottawa (Tuesday), Buffalo (Thursday), Washington (Saturday) and Carolina (Sunday.) Here are five things to know about those squads.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>1. The Senators traded their leading goal scorer last week —</strong> Not that you were too worried about their offense in the first place. Ottawa enters the week at 25th in the NHL in scoring at 2.68 goals per game. Still, Jean-Gabriel Pageau was one of the biggest names to move before the NHL’s trade deadline, so his absence should be noticeable. He’d scored 24 goal and notched 16 assists before he was sent to the New York Islanders for a package of draft picks, adding to what was already a significant stockpile selections the Senators hope will bolster their rebuild in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>2. Domimik Kahun is on the board for the Sabres —</strong> The former Penguins winger scored in his Buffalo debut Friday against Vegas.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>He also added an assist Saturday at Arizona to give him an average of a point per game since the Penguins sent him away in the deal that netted Conor Sheary and Evan Rodrigues, both of whom are still searching for their first points with their new team. It’s obviously way too early to judge the trade based on that production, but the early results, at least, are definitely favoring the Sabres.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Washington has rebuilt its division lead —</strong>&nbsp;The Penguins and Capitals were dead even at 80 points in the standings when they last met Feb. 23. Since then, the Capitals have won the head-to-head meeting and two of their next three to take a comfortable six-point lead on their rival in the Metropolitan standings. Surging Philadelphia is now the nearest threat, three points back, and travels to face Washington on Wednesday in a game that will have significant implications for the Penguins’ ability to stay in the race.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Carolina’s offense is dangerous —</strong> The Hurricanes are easy to overlook because they start the week sixth in a strong Metropolitan Division. Their scoring profile really isn’t dramatically different from the Penguins’, though. They’re 12th in the NHL in goals per game at 3.16, one spot above the Penguins (3.14.) They’re 11th in goals against at 2.86, right behind the eighth-pace Penguins at 2.78. And their prolific trio of&nbsp;Sebastian Aho,&nbsp;Teuvo Teravainen and&nbsp;Andrei Svechnikov — all of whom have at least 58 points — rivals anything the Penguins can throw at them statistically. Not a team the Penguins can afford to take lightly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Goaltending is the weakness —</strong> Only Philadelphia has allowed fewer shots per game than Carolina this season, but that hasn’t translated to similarly stellar goal prevention because Petr Mrazek and James Reimer haven’t been very good. Neither ranks better than 26th in save percentage or 24th in goals against average. Injuries, of course, have been a factor. Zamboni driver David Ayres famously stood in for both in an emergency capacity Feb. 22 in a win over Toronto.&nbsp;Alex Nedeljkovic and&nbsp;Anton Forsberg have filled in since and are winless in three starts, so perhaps the Penguins will be able to take advantage of the musical chairs regardless of whether Reimer and/or Mrazek return this week or not.&nbsp;</p>
