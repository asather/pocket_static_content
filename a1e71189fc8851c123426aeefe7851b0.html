<h1>Paul Zeise: Pirates should be careful about which young players they try to sign long term</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates have reportedly approached Ke’Bryan Hayes, Joe Musgrove, Kevin Newman and Bryan Reynolds about long-term contracts. These would be the kind of deals that would buy out the players’ arbitration seasons and keep them in Pirates uniforms a few years into what would normally be their free agency seasons.</p>
<p>That’s what the franchise did to lock up Andrew McCutchen and keep him through their run of wild-card games. It made a lot of sense for the Pirates because it was clear McCutchen was going to be a superstar. It made sense for McCutchen because he was able to get a big chunk of money guaranteed before he became one.</p>
<p>It worked out well for both parties, which is not always the case.</p>
<p>In these cases, the most important thing for the Pirates, of course, is to get some cost certainty going forward. I like the plan, but I’m just not sure I like the idea of locking up players who have not shown anything that would suggest they are headed for stardom, at least yet.</p>
<p>Take Hayes, who was the Pirates’ first-round pick in 2015, for example. He seems to have loads of potential. Everything we have seen from him and read about him suggests he is an excellent fielding third baseman. But he didn’t exactly light the world on fire at Class AAA Indianapolis last season. He hit .265/.335/.415 last season in Indy, with 10 home runs in 110 games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hayes may become a superstar, but he has shown nothing — other than some spring training success — at the major league level that should warrant the Pirates wanting to lock him up for a long-term deal. It doesn’t make sense at this point.&nbsp;If the Pirates do believe he is a major part of their future, they need to put him on the 26-man roster and let him play every day.&nbsp;At some point during the season it will become more clear who Hayes is and whether or not he is a player the Pirates can build around.</p>
<p>Newman and Reynolds, on the other hand, both make some sense because both showed last season they can play — and hit — at a high level. Newman is the perfect kind of complementary player whom every winning team needs as he is a good fielder, hits for average and even has a little bit of pop (12 home runs last season) for a middle infielder.</p>
<p>And Reynolds, to me, might be the Pirates’ best player. He might actually be a superstar, but at the very least he’s an really good baseball player and like Newman, is the kind of player every winning team has. Reynolds is just scratching the surface, too, so it wouldn’t be much of a risk to sign him to a long-term deal.</p>
<p>The desire to lock up Joe Musgrove is puzzling. He’s an excellent teammate, a clubhouse guy and is fiery and competitive and all that stuff. There is a lot to like about him as a player, but he has been slightly below average since he got here.</p>
<p>That’s not to say Musgrove can’t develop, but there is no way the Pirates, who are always strapped for money, should be trying to sign him for a long-term deal at this point. Plenty of pitchers out there can do what Musgrove has done to this point in his career. And as they found out with Jose Tabata, signing the wrong young player to a long-term deal can become an expensive mistake.</p>
<p>The Pirates seem to be on the right path and are thinking correctly. They are doing a good job of doing their due diligence and trying to lay out a path for future success. It makes a lot of sense to approach some of their youngest players about contract extensions. They should, however, reserve those deals for the players who have proven themselves on some level.</p>
