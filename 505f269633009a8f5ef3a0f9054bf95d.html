<h1>Top-50 2022 recruit Jalen Hood-Schifino decommits from Pitt</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Four-star guard Jalen Hood-Schifino, Pitt basketball’s highest-ranked commit in nearly a decade, is no longer a member of the Panthers’ 2022 class.</p>
<p>Hood-Schifino decommitted from Pitt on Monday afternoon, <a href="https://basketballrecruiting.rivals.com/news/four-star-guard-jalen-hood-schifino-decommits-from-pitt" target="_blank">according to Rivals.com</a>. The No. 33 overall player in the class said that while Pitt will “always be at the top” of his list, he also wants to explore other options.</p>
<p>“I kind of want to experience the whole process,” Hood-Schifino told Rivals. “I just think that I did everything too fast without enjoying this once-in-a-lifetime experience.”</p>
<p>Hood-Schifino’s decision isn’t a total surprise. The 6-foot-4 combo guard <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/06/25/recruiting-notebook-jalen-hood-schifino-pitt-montverde-devin-carney/stories/202006170180" target="_blank">told the Post-Gazette in late June</a> that his commitment to Pitt was firm, noting that he’s in almost daily contact with head coach Jeff Capel and assistant coach Jason Capel.</p>
<p>As an early commit, Hood-Schifino was active in recruiting other players to join him in the Panthers’ 2022 class. “I tell them that we can really turn the program around if they come to Pitt,” Hood-Schifino told the Post-Gazette in June. “Playing against Duke and North Carolina, teams like that, we can win a championship.”</p>
<p>Still, when Hood-Schifino committed on Dec. 30, he was more than two years away from signing — and anyone who follows recruiting can confirm that a lot can happen in that amount of time.</p>
<p>When Hood-Schifino picked Pitt seven months ago, it was seen as Capel’s first significant, sought-after recruiting coup. William Jeffress, a top-100 forward in the 2020 class, was still four months from choosing the Panthers. Then a five-star prospect on 247 Sports, Hood-Schifino was the highest-rated Pitt recruit since Steven Adams in 2012. He had offers from Florida, Mississippi, Clemson, Virginia Tech and Wichita State.</p>
<p>Hood-Schifino has a hometown pull to the Panthers. He’s the nephew of Drew Schifino, a former Penn Hills and West Virginia standout, and Jake Schifino, another Penn Hills native and former NFL wide receiver, and&nbsp;he spent his childhood in Penn Hills and Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p>However, Hood-Schifino announced in June that he would transfer from Combine Academy in North Carolina to national power Montverde Academy, near Orlando, for his junior and senior seasons. Montverde, where NBA stars Ben Simmons and D’Angelo Russell honed their skills before college, was ranked as the No. 1 high school team in the country by <a href="https://www.espn.com/high-school/story/_/id/28477762/espn-high-school-top-25" target="_blank">ESPN</a> back in March.</p>
<p>With Hood-Schifino set to star alongside and compete against a host of top-100 prospects, his profile could rise nationally — making it harder on Capel and the Panthers to get him back on board in the future.</p>
