<h1>Spelling of Andrew McCutchen's name claims another victim in spectacular fashion</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The spelling of Andrew McCutchen’s name has flummoxed people since he broke into the big leagues with the Pirates in 2009. Even when he was winning MVP awards and leading the Pirates to the playoffs in 2013-15, the next tweet in your timeline referring to him as&nbsp;“McCutcheon” or some similar derivation was never too far away.</p>
<p>Enter Howard Eskin, Philadelphia television and radio personality and, on Wednesday, the poor soul who made that timeless error, and then some.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You read that correctly. He didn’t just butcher the last name of the now-Phillie. He blew it on the first name, too. Lawrence? Really? Predictably, Twitter hilarity ensued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eskin didn’t take too kindly to the ribbing either, firing off this spicy post, which really only made matters worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>D’oh. He still missed the last name in his second crack at it. And of course, it led to another merciless round of teasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the Phillies Twitter account itself got in on the action, delivering this scalding burn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Howard, listen. We’ve all been there. Far be it for me to say I’ve never goofed a name — perhaps even this one, in particular, at some point! — in this business.</p>
<p>But for your own good, it’s McCutchen. M-C-C-U-T-C-H-E-N. Put it on a sticky&nbsp;note on your laptop screen or something.&nbsp;</p>
