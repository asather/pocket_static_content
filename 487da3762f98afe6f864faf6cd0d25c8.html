<h1>Comcast making select content free to Xfinity X1, Flex subscribers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Comcast is making it more entertaining for its Xfinity X1 and Flex subscribers to shelter in place. On-demand catalogs from premium networks and subscription video on demand (SVOD) will be available for a limited time for no additional charge.</p>
<p>These will be rolled out in the coming weeks. Subscribers can use the voice command&nbsp;“free” to see what’s available for now. Most of the offers cover 30 days, including shows such as Showtime’s “Homeland,”&nbsp;“Shameless” and&nbsp;“Billions.” Flex subscribers can watch fare including&nbsp;“Kidding” and&nbsp;“City on a Hill.”</p>
<p>Flex is a basic streaming device that works with Comcast internet services.</p>
<p>Other networks include EPIX, Curiosity Stream, History Vault, DOGTV, The Reading Corner, and Grokker Yoga Fitness &amp; Wellbeing.</p>
<p>“This is an unprecedented time and we want to be there for our customers to help make the time they’re spending at home easier with free previews from our network, studio and streaming partners,” said Rebecca Heap, senior vice president of video and entertainment at Comcast.</p>
<p>Kids Room and the Great Courses Signature Collection are other choices. More content will be announced in the near future.</p>
