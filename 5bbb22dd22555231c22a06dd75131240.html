<h1>Paul Zeise: Leadership lacking across the sports landscape</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>John F. Kennedy and the directors at NASA had a vision that they could safely put a man on the moon, so in 1961, they began to put plans in place to do just that. There were plenty of critics, doubters and people saying it was impossible and not safe, but that didn’t deter Kennedy and NASA from getting the plan in motion. Eight&nbsp;years later, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin launched into space and walked on the moon for almost four hours.</p>
<p>I bring that up because that used to be the American spirit, one of strength, one of courage and one that said, “We can” as opposed to, “We can’t.”</p>
<p>That spirit, however, is dead in many places these days, as we have become a nation that crumbles in fear and gives up trying at the first sign of adversity or trouble, especially with respect to this pandemic.</p>
<p>We have never been a nation of quitters. Kennedy is just one example, but there are many others in our history.</p>
<p>What if Ben Franklin and Thomas Edison listened to critics calling them lunatics for trying to harness electricity? We would have candles instead of lamps to light our rooms.</p>
<p>What if Sir Alexander Fleming stopped experimenting with infectious diseases before he came up with penicillin because his hours and days of research weren’t yielding results?</p>
<p>This is why I commend Bob Lombardi and the PIAA, the commissioners of the ACC, Big 12 and SEC, Major League Baseball and even the NFL. And it is why the Pac-12 and Big Ten should be criticized for pulling the plug on their fall sports seasons so early.</p>
<p>Saying&nbsp;“we can’t do it”&nbsp;takes no leadership or vision. And we have way too much of that kind of spineless leadership, from politicians to school boards to boards of health and, yes, to sports league administrators. But Lombardi captured the spirit we should all operate with these days when he was asked about whether or not high school sports in Pennsylvania could be played this fall. His answer was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-football/2020/08/14/PIAA-meets-with-Gov-Wolf-decisions-on-fall-sports-left-to-schools/stories/202008140101" target="_blank">“the only wrong decision is if we don’t give it a try.”</a></p>
<p>That is leadership. That is courage. And that is the spirit with which we should approach all of these decisions.</p>
<p>In March and April, shutting down, canceling and closing things made some sense because we had no idea what we were dealing with. In August, we know what we are dealing with, whom it effects and what the risks are.</p>
<p>We should be pushing forward and doing so with the spirit of MLB’s approach, with&nbsp;diligence and determination. And despite some adversity,&nbsp;I really believe there will be a World Series this year.</p>
<p>Maybe the Big Ten and Pac-12 will ultimately be right and it is impossible to play college football this fall. But that decision shouldn’t have been made yet because there was no reason to quit without trying. Educators and administrators are supposed to set an example, and that example shouldn’t be to quit when it looks like it might take some hard work and creativity to pull something off.</p>
<p>True leadership looks for ways to make things happen, not reasons to shut them down or cancel them.</p>
