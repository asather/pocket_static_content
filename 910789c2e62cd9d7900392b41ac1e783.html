<h1>Poise Foundation raising more funds to support Black community  </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Poise Foundation, a Black-led philanthropy, is ramping up fundraising for its Human Equity and Justice Fund in the wake of widespread racial unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The fund was established in 2018 following the shooting death of Black teenager Antwon Rose II by a white police officer in East Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>It was designed to support organizations helping the Black community respond to social justice crises.</p>
<p>Poise plans to expand grantmaking from the fund to address the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on the Black community; and ongoing protests and social activism spurred by recent police killings of Blacks including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.</p>
<p>Poise said the fund recently received contributions of $50,000 from the Henry L. Hillman Foundation and $10,000 from McAuley Ministries.</p>
<p>It has launched a crowdfunding site to raise more from individuals and organizations.&nbsp;Grants of up to $2,500 will go to Black-led organizations responding to COVID-19 in the Black community; and grants of up to $5,000 will be made to Black-led groups working on youth leadership initiatives and social justice programs.</p>
<p>“We are in a moment where our country recognizes the inhumanity that has existed for centuries cannot continue,” said Mark Lewis, president and chief executive of Downtown-based Poise.&nbsp;“We need to ensure that this moment becomes a movement … This fund seeks to support both this moment and building capacity for the movement.”</p>
<p>The fundraising campaign is being launched in connection with the start of Black Philanthropy Month on Saturday.</p>
<p>In April, Poise launched a Critical Community Needs Fund to help small nonprofits and churches that were assisting vulnerable people in Black communities impacted by the pandemic.&nbsp;That fund last month had raised nearly $900,000 and made grants to more than 60 groups in the region.</p>
