<h1>Dissecting that 'ugly inning' in the Pirates' nightcap against the Cardinals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates have obviously had a difficult time stringing together wins, but they’re connecting teaching moments this season like a master seamstress.</p>
<p>They kicked it into high gear in the sixth inning of a doubleheader nightcap against the Cardinals on Friday at PNC Park, flipping a one-run lead into a 7-2 loss in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Two walks. Three errors, which included a catcher’s interference call on Jacob Stallings. A brain cramp from Gregory Polanco. Even a missed call by the home-plate umpire that may have disrupted Chad Kuhl’s rhythm.</p>
<p>It was all there for dissection, brutal and futile as that exercise may be.</p>
<p>“Everything kind of snowballed,” manager Derek Shelton said. “It was an ugly inning.”</p>
<p>It was an avalanche, really. The kind of onslaught we’ve seen far too many times from a team seeking improvement in basic areas. One that, with two more losses Friday, saw its record fall to 15-36.</p>
<p>The inning started with a walk to Tommy Edman, on a pitch at the bottom of the zone. This was important because Stallings was called out on a pitch in the same location in the top of the seventh, leading to his unlikely ejection.</p>
<p>Designated hitter Paul Goldschmidt reached when his bat hit Stallings’ glove before Kuhl issued a four-pitch walk to third baseman Brad Miller, loading the bases. That’s when Shelton turned to Chris Stratton to get the Pirates out of a jam.</p>
<p>The first of three successive miscues came on a sacrifice fly from shortstop Paul DeJong, as Polanco inexplicably threw home with no realistic shot of nailing Edman. If Polanco throws to second, it would have kept the double play in order.</p>
<p>Which was important because …</p>
<p>Left fielder Tyler O’Neill hit a ball to third that Ke’Bryan Hayes, so solid defensively thus far, threw away for his first major league error. It looked like he rushed the throw, and Shelton said Hayes didn’t have a good grip on the ball.</p>
<p>“He’s human,” Shelton said. “He made a mistake. We haven’t seen him make a mistake.”</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it’s a much easier and more natural play for Hayes to start a 5-4-3 double play, but that wasn’t available because Polanco threw home and not where he should’ve thrown the ball.</p>
<p>“He’s got to hit the cutoff man,” Shelton said. “It was one of those things where we didn’t execute at all in that inning.”</p>
<p>First baseman Matt Carpenter was next, hitting a ball to Josh Bell that also could’ve been a double play. Bell thought about going home, then went to second before throwing the ball into left field while falling to the ground.</p>
<p>Bell has done plenty of extra work at first base and has tried hard to make this work, but there has unfortunately been more of this and less evidence of comfort for him at first base. The inevitable conclusion seems to be that Bell will be destined for designated hitter duty assuming that job remains in the National League for 2021.</p>
<p>“I think he was off-balance,” Shelton said of Bell. “That’s just an assumption on my part. I thought he got caught in-between; he thought he was going to throw the ball home, then threw it to second. Once he got there, he was so far down that the ball got away from him.”</p>
<p>The whole inning blew up when Cardinals rookie Dylan Carlson crushed a three-run home run to turn this one into a rout.</p>
<p>Walks and errors contributing to a Pirates loss is hardly a new concept. Heck, it’s been one of the most consistent storylines of the season, which is nearing its merciless end.</p>
<p>Pirates pitchers came into Friday’s doubleheader with the worst rate of walks per nine innings (4.50) in baseball. They had also made the most errors in MLB. Four more Friday — over two games — brought their season total to 45 in 51 games.</p>
<p>How ugly was the implosion? The Cardinals struck for six runs in the sixth inning and not a single one of them was earned.</p>
<p>“We got a lot of teachable moments from [Friday],” Shelton said. “We got a bunch of teachable moments from the sixth inning. We have to address them.”</p>
<p>The good news is that the Pirates got an improved start from Kuhl — before the sixth inning — after he soaked one of his fingers in lime juice (yes, seriously) to fix a blister. As a result, Kuhl had much better fastball command, and his breaking stuff was crisp.</p>
<p>The Pirates also enjoyed Bryan Reynolds’ first home run into the Allegheny River, a 436-foot shot that bounced in after the outfielder turned on an elevated fastball. Came with Reynolds batting in the leadoff spot, too, something Shelton decided to do on a whim.</p>
<p>“I knew I got it,” Reynolds said. “It felt really good to connect on that.”</p>
<p>But the feeling the Pirates had toward the end of this one was hardly positive. They were frustrated over a mistake-filled sixth and some inconsistent umpiring, watching what looked to be a possible win disintegrate into a mistake-filled mess in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>“Just unacceptable,” Kuhl said of the missed call on Edman. “That’s a strike three call, but then we have an unfortunate catcher’s interference. You don’t blame Stalls for that. He’s trying to make a play on the guy running. End up striking out Goldschmidt, too. So I start that inning with two strikeouts, and we somehow have guys on first and second.</p>
<p>“It’s just kind of an unfortunate, weird start to a really weird inning.”</p>
