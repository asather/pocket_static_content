<h1>Sunny weather tempts Europe during social distancing; Queen Elizabeth urges self-discipline</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>LONDON — As warm, sunny weather beckoned across Europe, Queen Elizabeth II appealed to Britons on Sunday to exercise self-discipline in “an increasingly challenging time” as the country saw a record 24-hour jump in COVID-19 deaths that even outpaced the daily toll in hard-hit Italy.</p>
<p>Britain recorded 708 new coronavirus deaths, bringing its overall toll to 4,313 as infections rose past 42,000, while Italy reported 631 deaths. Those coming down with the virus in the U.K. include Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the health secretary, England’s chief medical official and Prince Charles, heir to the British throne.</p>
<p>There are wide fears that Mr. Johnson’s Conservative government did not take the virus seriously enough at first and that lovely weather will tempt Britons and others to break social distancing rules.</p>
<p>In an address to the nation to be televised later Sunday, the 93-year-old queen said the pandemic had caused enormous disruptions, bringing grief, financial difficulties and daunting challenges to everybody. It was only the fourth time since her reign began in 1953 that she has given such an address.</p>
<p>“I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,” she said in pre-released remarks.</p>
<p>The address was recorded at in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle — it allowed enough space between the monarch and the camera person, who wore personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>The queen’s son, Charles, on Friday remotely opened a vast temporary hospital for coronavirus patients in a London convention center after completing a week of isolation. Mr. Johnson as of Friday still had a fever but his infected pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, tweeted she is “on the mend” after a week in bed.</p>
<p>As the sun shone and the temperatures rose toward 68 degrees Fahrenheit, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said sunbathing in public places was not allowed and the U.K. might even ban outdoor exercise if people still ‘’flout the rules.‘‘</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“The vast majority of people are following the public health advice, which is absolutely critical, and staying at home,” Mr. Hancock told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday program. “But there are a small minority of people who are still not doing that — it’s quite unbelievable, frankly, to see that.”</p>
<p>Restrictions vary from country to country. In Germany and Britain, residents can get out to exercise and walk their dogs, as well as go to the supermarket, the post office and other essential tasks. Yet in Serbia and South Africa, dog walking is not allowed.</p>
<p>In France, heat-seeking drones have been whizzing over Fontainebleau forest to identify rule-breakers after the former royal estate in the Paris suburbs was closed to the public. That high-tech measure has been coupled with more traditional police patrols on horseback and roadblocks that turn back the cars of those seeking to escape urban areas.</p>
<p>In Sweden, authorities have advised the public to practice social distancing, but schools, bars and restaurants are still open.</p>
<p>At the Vatican, Pope Francis celebrated Mass and blessed palms for Palm Sunday in a near-empty St. Peter’s Basilica. Usually tens of thousands of faithful would have crowded the square outside to attend a papal Mass.</p>
<p>Holy Thursday and Easter services will be held the same way. In the pope’s native Argentina, the faithful were using plants at home for a “virtual” blessing during a livestream of the Palm Sunday service.</p>
<p>Italians have not been immune to lure of the good weather either, even though the country has the world’s highest coronavirus death toll at more than 15,000.</p>
<p>Top Italian officials took to national television after photos were published showing huge crowds out shopping in Naples, Rome, Genoa and even the hard-hit Veneto city of Padua. Lombardy vice governor Fabrizio Sala said cellphone date showed 38% of the region’s people were out and about — the highest figure since March 20.</p>
<p>Health Minister Roberto Speranza told RAI state television that all the sacrifices Italians have made since the nationwide lockdown began on March 10 risked being reversed.</p>
<p>As deaths and infections soared across the United States, new infections were slowing in Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>Spain announced 6,023 confirmed new infections Sunday, taking its national tally to 130,759 but down from an increase of 7,026 infections in the previous day. Spain’s confirmed new virus deaths dropped for the third straight day, to 674 — the first time daily deaths have fallen below 800 in the past week.</p>
<p>“We are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez.</p>
<p>Worldwide, more than 1.2 million people have been confirmed infected and almost 65,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The true numbers are certainly much higher, due to limited testing, different ways nations count the dead and deliberate under-reporting by some governments.</p>
<p>Almost 250,000 people have recovered from the virus, which is spread by microscopic droplets from coughs or sneezes. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most but for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia and lead to death. The World Health Organization says 95% of the known coronavirus deaths in Europe have been in people over 60.</p>
<p>The rapid spread of the virus in the United States has prompted a chaotic scramble for desperately needed medical equipment and protective gear, prompting intense squabbling between the states and federal government.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo praised China for facilitating a shipment of 1,000 ventilators, while President Donald Trump claimed that states are making inflated requests for supplies. In mixed messages, Mr. Trump warned that the country could be headed into its toughest weeks but also said he’s eager to get it reopened and its stalled economy back on track.</p>
<p>The number of people infected in the U.S. has soared to more than 312,000 as the fatalities climbed past 8,500.</p>
<p>New York City is the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, but other areas have been slammed as well. More than 400 people have died in Louisiana, where state authorities have been rushing to find ventilators. Michigan has more than 14,000 infections and 500 deaths, mainly in Detroit.</p>
<p>Beijing authorities said Sunday about 78,000 people had visited cemeteries in the Chinese capital for annual “tomb-sweeping” ceremonies, down 90% over last year. Visitors were required to reserve a space in advance. Thousands of others paid their respects through an online portal that allowed them to light a candle, burn incense and offer wine and flowers, all virtually.</p>
