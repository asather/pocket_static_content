<h1>FBI group opposes release of woman who killed Pittsburgh agent</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An organization representing FBI agents said Friday that it strongly opposes the release of a woman who killed a Pittsburgh agent in 2008.</p>
<p>Christina Korbe shot Agent Sam Hicks during a drug raid and was sentenced to 15 years and 10 months.</p>
<p>But her lawyers have filed a motion for early release, saying she's contracted COVID-19.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney has until today to respond but the FBI Agents Association, which represents 14,000 current and former agents, has already weighed in.</p>
<p>The group said that Korbe should be required to serve her full term because it is "necessary to honor the memory of Agent Hicks and to protect all other law enforcement officers who place themselves in harm’s way to protect the public."</p>
<p>The association also said that this is the third time in seven years that Korbe has tried to avoid serving the sentence she agreed to serve when she pleaded guilty in 2011.</p>
<p>"She has not demonstrated the 'extraordinary and compelling' reasons that must exist to justify compassionate release," the group said. "The Hicks family must live their lives without their loved one — a husband, father and son — forever because of Korbe, and she should not be able to use her family as an excuse to avoid responsibility for the death of Agent Hicks."</p>
<p>Korbe shot Agent Hicks on Nov. 19, 2008, when she opened fire on law officers serving a search warrant on her home following an investigation of the drug-trafficking operation of her husband, Robert Korbe.</p>
<p>Agent Hicks was 33 and had served with the FBI for 18 months following an earlier career with the Baltimore police department. He left behind his wife and young son.</p>
<p>Korbe pleaded guilty in 2011 to voluntary manslaughter. She is housed at a federal prison in Connecticut and due for release May 18, 2022.</p>
<p>In her motion for release, she said she began showing signs of COVID on March 29, five days after her roommate was quarantined. She said she was ordered to strip her roommate's bedding and put it in the trash.</p>
<p>She said she contracted COVID, had a headache, lost her senses of taste and smell, suffered body aches and nausea and coughed so hard she broke a rib.</p>
<p>In her filing, she reiterated her often-claimed position that she never intended to kill Agent Hicks but fired to protect her children.</p>
<p>She initially requested compassionate release from the warden in April, saying she has been in prison for more than 11 years and has two children and an 87-year-old mother who has suffered three strokes. She said she lost her father to cancer and her 74-year-old father-in-law is raising the children alone.</p>
<p>On Aug. 20, she filed a motion for a reduced sentence under the federal First Step Act, which allows courts to reduce prison terms for "extraordinary and compelling reasons."</p>
<p>She said her request should be granted because of her health conditions combined with the fact that she is less than a year from being eligible for release to a halfway house. She also cited the "remorse she displayed at sentencing," which she said has "has inspired her to move her own life in the only direction it could go: toward healing herself and others around her.
