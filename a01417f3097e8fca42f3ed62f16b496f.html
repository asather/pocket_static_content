<h1>Botched breakouts are one way the Penguins can get knocked off by an underdog again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When it comes to denying entry into their territory, only the Canada Border Services Agency may be better than the Penguins at not letting folks over the line.</p>
<p>Per Sportlogiq, Mike Sullivan’s squad this season ranked first in the NHL in zone denial rate at 51.1% and, subsequently, seventh in expected goals against.</p>
<p>The coach wants his defensemen to step up and challenge puck-carriers as they cross the blue line in even-numbered situations. And Kris Letang and John Marino, among others, are adept at taking away time and space and forcing a decision, emboldened knowing that Penguins forwards should be tracking back to help out.</p>
<p>So when Pittsburgh’s qualifying-round series against Montreal starts Saturday, the Canadiens, who have more speed than skill up front, may be looking to lob pucks into one of the corners and try to create chaos and a scoring chance.</p>
<p>“They’re a really fast team. They forecheck sometimes with two or three guys,” Letang said. “So it’s going to be important to be able to come out of our zone clean. Make sure we have support low. ... Going forward, against a team that has a heavy forecheck and fast forwards, we might have to simplify things.”</p>
<p>The Penguins did not do that often enough Tuesday against the Philadelphia Flyers. Most notably, they badly botched their breakout on the play where Evgeni Malkin had that atrocious giveaway and gifted the go-ahead goal to Kevin Hayes.</p>
<p>One Flyer flipped the puck into the left corner then gave chase to pressure Letang. Another Philly forward headed toward Brian Dumoulin in the other corner, eliminating that option for Letang. When Letang banked it off the boards to try to reverse the flow, that second Flyers forward swerved toward Malkin.</p>
<p>From there, there are still no good guesses for what Geno was thinking, throwing a blind pass into the middle where the third Flyer, Hayes, lurked.</p>
<p>That was a simple forecheck from the Flyers, with none of those forwards really busting their butts to fluster the Penguins into a bad giveaway. There were a few more of those from Penguins in their zone in the 3-2 overtime loss, including one where the typically steady Marino centered it to a Flyer in the slot.</p>
<p>“In the first part of the game, I don’t think we handled their forecheck as well as we could have,” Sullivan said. “We had opportunities to make plays to beat the pressure and we hit a skate or we hit a stick. ... I just think those are the subtleties that I’m talking about, that these guys will get better [over time].”</p>
<p>Sure, some of those inaccurate passes can maybe be chalked up to rust after not playing a game in 20 weeks. But that lone exhibition was their only opportunity to excuse things away. Starting Saturday, the outcomes mean everything.</p>
<p>And if they keep coughing up the puck against a Canadiens team that will look to come in waves, the ultimate outcome could be an early playoff exit.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to do a good job of getting back to pucks quickly,” Sullivan said. “We’re going to have to help one another. We’re going to have to offer some interference coming through the neutral zone to buy time for our defensemen. And then we’re going to have to be on the same page and execute.”</p>
<p>Where have we heard that before? Ah, yes, their last playoff appearance.</p>
<p>The New York Islanders used a ferocious forecheck and a frenzied fan base on Long Island to get the jump on the Penguins in Game 1 of their first-round series last April. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/04/11/pittsburgh-penguins-new-york-islanders-forecheck-mike-sullivan-stanley-cup-playoffs/stories/201904110133" target="_blank">The Islanders blitzed their blue-liners</a>, scored 100 seconds into Game 1 and never looked back. The Penguins scored just six goals in the sweep.</p>
<p>Those Islanders played a much heavier game than this Canadiens squad, which looks like a team of a bunch of little guys on the old Nintendo “Ice Hockey” game. And Montreal’s structure under coach Claude Julien is not as airtight.</p>
<p>But the Canadiens are still capable of frustrating with their forecheck. That’s one of the few ways the underdogs can knock off the Penguins in a short series.</p>
