<h1>Arrest made in 2013 shooting death of Baby Marcus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh police on Saturday arrested a Wilkinsburg man in connection to the 2013 fatal shooting of a 1-year-old child.</p>
<p>Gregory Parker, 22, was charged with homicide in the death of Marcus White Jr., known as Baby Marcus. Two women also were injured in the shooting, which happened at a cookout in the East Hills neighborhood on May 21, 2013.</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint, Parker fired the round that went through Marcus’ aunt, who picked up the baby to protect him, and killed the infant. Marcus was 15-months-old when he died.</p>
<p>In 2018, a witness told police that Parker had confessed to the killing, claiming his gun — a .45 caliber Hi-Point pistol — was the only weapon strong enough to go through somebody and kill the baby.</p>
<p>Detectives earlier this month received statements from a new witness, identified in the complaint as Witness 2, who was able to place Parker at the scene.</p>
<p>The witness told detectives Parker and his associates were at a residence in Pittsburgh’s East Hills neighborhood before Marcus’ killing. The complaint identifies Dayjohn&nbsp;“Day Day” Parker, while two others are referenced as Co-Conspirator 1 and Co-Conspirator 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the group was together, someone received a phone call notifying them that a target of theirs was in East Hills, the complaint reads. Witness 2 believed this was the motive that precipitated the shooting.</p>
<p>Witness 2 stayed behind and watched Parker, “Day Day,” Co-Conspirator 1 and Co-Conspirator 2 arm themselves and enter a black Saturn Aura. The vehicle left and the Witness heard multiple gunshots, the complaint reads. About three minutes later, the Saturn returned to the residence.</p>
<p>When the group returned, the witness described them as hyper and excited.&nbsp;“They were turned up by it,” Witness 2 told detectives, and said “Day Day” exclaimed, “We got a smack in,” referencing the killing. After realizing this, the witness told the group to leave, and they were advised to burn the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Witness 2 spoke with Co-Conspirator 2, the armed getaway driver, after realizing a baby had been killed. Co-Conspirator 2 told the witness that he didn’t fire into the crowd. In September of that year, when “Day Day” Parker was fatally shot in Homewood, the driver said,&nbsp;“It’s Karma.”</p>
<p>Police connected that testimony to a case in which a Saturn was found burned in Penn Hills. A man in 2013 reported on May 22 that his 2008 Saturn Aura was stolen a day before at Race Street and Collier Street in Homewood North. The vehicle later was found and determined a total loss because of a fire, the complaint reads.</p>
<p>The shooting received new attention recently when Parker was used as a witness in the <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-wilkinsburg-mass-shooting/" target="_blank">2016 Wilkinsburg shooting</a> that killed&nbsp;five people at a backyard cookout. During the trial, defense attorneys learned that Parker — identified in court documents only as Witness No. 3 — had confessed to the killing in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prosecutors in the Wilkinsburg case decided not call Parker to the stand after the defense <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/24/Wilkinsburg-mass-shooting-Key-jailhouse-witness-Allegheny-County-Police-Robert-Thomas-Cheron-Shelton/stories/202001240152" target="_blank">alleged there were discovery violations</a> when they learned Parker received financial consideration by county police — something that was not revealed until 10 days before the trial was set to start.</p>
<p>Judge Edward J. Borkowksi then dismissed charges against one of the two accused Wilkinsburg killers, Robert Thomas, the day the trial began. The other defendant,&nbsp;Cheron Shelton, went to trial and was acquitted of all charges.</p>
<p>“We’re very pleased that an arrest was finally made,” Paul Jubas, the attorney for Marcus’ family, said at a press conference Saturday evening.&nbsp;“It’s a good start for getting justice for Baby Marcus. It’s a good start towards getting justice for this family, however there are a number of things that need to be taken care of before this process goes any further.”</p>
<p>Mr. Jubas demanded that state Attorney General Josh Shapiro take the case since Distract Attorney Stephen Zappala “covered up” the confession, which presents a conflict of interest, he said. Mr. Jubas also said he would be filing a lawsuit against the District Attorney’s office, the Allegheny County Police and the federal authorities that were involved in the investigation.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, the DA’s office sent a statement reading: “In the past few days, City of Pittsburgh homicide detectives communicated to us that they had received additional information concerning the death of Marcus White Jr. Based on this additional information, our office approved the filing of numerous charges, including a charge of homicide, against Gregory Parker.”</p>
<p>Parker also was said to be a defendant in a 2015 vigil shooting in Homewood. Those charges were withdrawn in February, 10 days before jury selection was scheduled in the case,&nbsp;after defense attorneys demanded information from the DA’s office about Parker following his involvement in the Wilkinsburg trial.</p>
<p>“Due to the murder of a commonwealth witness, subsequent lack of cooperation of witness and other evidentiary issues, the commonwealth is unable to proceed at this time,”&nbsp;Assistant District Attorney Russ Broman wrote when the charges were withdrawn.</p>
<p>Parker also is charged with criminal conspiracy, four counts of aggravated assault and gun charges.</p>
