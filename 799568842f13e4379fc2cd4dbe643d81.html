<h1>Pirates on pause: Is it time to be more aggressive on the bases?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With MLB hoping to return soon, the Post-Gazette’s Jason Mackey and Mike Persak will analyze 20 issues related to the Pirates — think 20 Thoughts or questions about the team. They’ll run each weekday online through May 22 and will appear in print (or via other PG digital platforms) on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</em></p>
<p>Frequently, when a new manager takes over an MLB team, you hear a mention of base running.</p>
<p>“We’re going to be more aggressive on the base paths,” they often say. It’s an easy, simple area of the game to point to for improvement, which only sometimes actually begets more aggressive base running.</p>
<p>Pirates manager Derek Shelton has mentioned it himself. Last month, on Post-Gazette columnists Ron Cook and Joe Starkey’s radio show on 93.7 The Fan, Shelton was asked for his theories on bunting. His answer, more or less, was that he is not a huge proponent of bunting, subscribing to the idea that it often gives away a free out. And at the end of his answer, he mentioned how he planned to approach moving runners along without bunting as frequently.</p>
<p>“I would say that I would rather move guys and be aggressive on the bases in terms of running hits and hit-and-runs than default to the bunt sign,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>So what exactly might that look like? And do the numbers suggest that the Pirates could benefit from a more aggressive approach on the base paths?</p>
<p>First, a misconception should be cleared up. As Shelton alluded to, base running doesn’t automatically refer to stolen bases, though it’s understandable for peoples’ minds to go there directly.</p>
<p>Since stolen bases are the easiest metric to understand, though, we’ll start there.</p>
<p>The Pirates finished 19th in MLB in stolen bases last year. They finished 22nd in stolen base percentage, successfully stealing the base on 69% of their attempts. For context, the Arizona Diamondbacks led the league at 86%, and the league average was 73%. In terms of aggressiveness in this department, the Pirates attempted 93 stolen bases all year, or .57 per game, which was the 18th most overall.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Pirates were 11th in MLB in extra bases taken percentage, which measures the amount of times a base runner advanced more than one base on a single, more than two bases on a double, etc. The Pirates did that at a 42% clip in 2019, a couple of ticks above league average. The Colorado Rockies were the best extra-base-percentage team in MLB, at 46%.</p>
<p>The last set of broader data we’ll look at is outs on base, which is the number of times a runner was put out while making a base running play. This includes things like getting caught stealing, attempting to take an extra base, getting thrown out attempting to advance on a fly ball or any other myriad ways a runner can be thrown out on the base paths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pirates accrued 60 outs on base, which was the second-most in MLB, only four behind the Chicago Cubs. The league average was 49.</p>
<p>All of those statistics are informative in their own way, but they also tell a different story of base-running aggressiveness. Basically, the Pirates weren’t very aggressive with stealing bases, but they were likely too aggressive on the base paths in general, leading to a lot of outs on base.</p>
<p>The intersection of those two facts is that increased aggressiveness may not be the answer to any base-running problem. It’s more that the Pirates, and every other team for that matter, should run smarter, meaning things should be dealt with case by case.</p>
<p>Outfielder Starling Marte carried the base-stealing load for the Pirates last season, with 25 stolen bags. The next highest on the team was shortstop Kevin Newman with 16, and nobody beyond that had more than five.</p>
<p>Marte is gone now. First-year Pirate Jarrod Dyson finished tied for seventh in MLB with 30 stolen bases in 2019. So Dyson’s production should, in theory, replace Marte.</p>
<p>The larger point here, though, is that the Pirates shouldn’t ask players who aren’t good at stealing bases to go out there and try to steal bases. That’s even more likely to run you into unnecessary outs than bunting.</p>
<p>Marte also led the team in individual outs on base, with 10, followed closely by first baseman Josh Bell, who had nine. Bell, for all his talents, isn’t necessarily a burner. He also finished with an extra-base-taken percentage of 33%. Basically, he could be categorized as a player who might help his team more by focusing on getting on base but taking a tempered approach once he gets there.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are some guys who can take an extra step in this department. Newman, for instance, clearly has the speed to make a difference on the base paths, and he has generally good instincts there, too, with an extra-base-taken rate of 40% last year. If he can continue to develop his base stealing instincts, maybe he could see an uptick in that department.</p>
<p>Third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes is speedy in his own right. If he sees time on the big-league roster, he might be a candidate for helping out on the base paths. Outfielder Gregory Polanco may be past his base-stealing prime, but he’s been successful before. At the very least, he could be a player who can bring a smart approach, using the instincts that made him a good base stealer in the past to provide a smart, sometimes-aggressive edge in terms of taking the extra base from time to time and avoiding unnecessary outs.</p>
<p>But guys like Bell, catcher Jacob Stallings or third baseman Colin Moran, none of whom stole a base last year, shouldn’t suddenly feel inclined to try to do so now. Plus, the Pirates should be wary of stealing too frequently ahead of a player like Bell, who might be more susceptible to an intentional walk if first base is left open after a runner steals second.</p>
<p>What’s more, team-by-team base-running statistics are variable in terms of how they relate to a successful offense or team. The Texas Rangers and Kansas City Royals were first and second in the league, respectively, in stolen bases. Neither made the playoffs. On the other hand, the St. Louis Cardinals and Washington Nationals were third and fourth, and met each other in the NLCS. Additionally, the Royals and Cardinals scored below league average in runs per game, while the Royals and Nationals were above league average.</p>
<p>Extra-base-taken percentage was more likely to yield an above average offense last year, but the Pirates were a counterpoint to that, finishing above league average in the former category and below in the latter.</p>
<p>So it’s hard to square exactly how aggressiveness on the base paths affects a team’s success. It more likely has to do with personnel, and whether that style of play can benefit a team. More acutely, some individual players can benefit from increased aggressiveness, while others could suffer.</p>
<p>For his part, Shelton understands this, too. In the same radio interview as mentioned earlier, he talked about his time as bench coach with the Minnesota Twins in 2019, when they stole just 28 bases all year.</p>
<p>“Last year, the team in Minnesota that we had, we went into the season thinking we were going to have to bunt and hit and run and do things a little bit more like that,” Shelton said. “And then all of the sudden, we had some guys that had breakout years, and we pushed away from it.”</p>
<p><strong>STATISTICALLY SPEAKING:&nbsp;</strong>In his last three minor-league seasons, Ke’Bryan Hayes has stolen at least 12 bases each year, highlighted by his 27 in 2017 with High-A Bradenton.</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THIS:&nbsp;</strong>In 2019, there were 2,280 stolen bases in MLB, the fewest over a non-shortened season since 1973.</p>
<p><strong>THEY SAID IT:&nbsp;</strong>“I create havoc on the base paths, play defense, and I’m just a playmaker; that’s how I describe myself. I go out there and do things that make people say, ‘Wow.’ I try to make it look easy while I’m doing it.” — Jarrod Dyson</p>
