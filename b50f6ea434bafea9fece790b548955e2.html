<h1>Notre Dame, Clemson and 'buy games': What the ACC's new schedule means for Pitt</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the Big Ten announced a conference-only football schedule on July 9, it seemed the remaining Power Five entities might simply follow suit. The Pac-12 did, in fact, the next day. The rest, though, dragged their feet in the weeks following. Until now.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Sports Illustrated’s Ross Dellenger reported that the SEC is also eyeing a conference-only slate. And minutes before that news came out, the ACC released a bit of its own.</p>
<p>Pitt and its fellow ACC programs will play an 11-game slate with 10 conference contests and one non-conference game, the ACC announced. Should the season go on in the COVID-19 pandemic, the games will begin between Sept. 7-12.</p>
<p>Notre Dame is set to join the conference for one season, bringing the member total to 15 programs at least for the time being. The Fighting Irish are ACC members in most sports and were scheduled to play six ACC schools in football this season anyway, including Pitt.</p>
<p>The Panthers will still host Notre Dame. They’ll also face four teams that weren’t on their original 2020 slate: Clemson, Boston College, Louisville and NC State. Pat Narduzzi’s team will welcome Virginia Tech, Syracuse, NC State and Louisville to Heinz Field. Meanwhile, Pitt will travel to play Clemson, Florida State, Miami, Boston College and Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>The dates and times for those matchups have yet to be released.</p>
<p>The Panthers will not face Coastal division foes North Carolina, Duke or Virginia — which doesn’t matter all that much because the Coastal and Atlantic divisions won’t be utilized. All 15 teams will operate under one roof.</p>
<p>The two teams with the best conference winning percentage will play in the ACC championship game on either Dec. 12 or Dec. 19 at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p>Much to the chagrin of some ACC fans, Notre Dame will be eligible for the title game and the conference’s spot in the Orange Bowl.</p>
<p>All television revenue for the 2020 season, including Notre Dame’s home games broadcasted by NBC, will be shared equally by all ACC schools.</p>
<p>Of course, this 11-game schedule is contingent upon college football’s testing and planning capabilities to pull off a season in the midst of a pandemic without a bubble — something Major League Baseball is having trouble pulling off.</p>
<p>But the new model is designed to give the ACC more flexibility to set protocols and make scheduling changes throughout the year if necessary. Plus, the ACC gets to potentially keep its high-profile, regional non-conference matchups: Clemson-South Carolina, Florida State-Florida, Louisville-Kentucky and Georgia Tech-Georgia.</p>
<p>Will it work? We’ll find out soon enough. In the meantime, let’s take a look at some of Pitt’s scheduling loose ends.</p>
<p><strong>What would it take to cancel a game due to COVID-19?</strong></p>
<p>The ACC's COVID-19 medical advisory group answered this very question in the announcement release. There are five circumstances in which games could be discontinued.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Inability to isolate new positive cases, or to quarantine high-contact-risk cases of the traveling and home team university students.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Unavailability or inability to perform symptomatic, surveillance or precompetition testing as required.</p>
<p>• Campus-wide or local community transmission rates that are considered unsafe by local public health officials.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Inability to perform adequate contact tracing consistent with governmental requirements or recommendations.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Local public health officials of the home team state that there is an inability for the hospital infrastructure to accommodate a surge in COVID-related hospitalizations.</p>
<p>In addition to those protocols, the conference states that all members of the football team (players, coaches, support staff, etc.) will be tested for the coronavirus each week, beginning with the week of the first game. PCR nasal swab tests must be administered three days before competition.</p>
<p>A player who tests positive for COVID-19 will be isolated for at least 10 days from the onset of symptoms and/or the positive test. Face coverings are required in bench areas for coaches and players. And positive test results of any team member that came in close contact with an opposing team member will be shared as quickly as possible with the previous opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Which team will Pitt play out of conference?</strong></p>
<p>This is where some will shout for West Virginia.</p>
<p>Richmond, Pitt’s Sept. 19 opponent at Heinz Field, isn’t playing football in the fall. The Colonial Athletic Association canceled its fall sports while allowing teams to schedule independently if they choose. But Richmond’s entire schedule on its official website reads: “Canceled.” When asked about non-conference games last week, Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke said Pitt is “understanding of Richmond’s situation at this time.”</p>
<p>So, Pitt has a possible open date on Sept. 19. And so do the Mountaineers. West Virginia was scheduled to host Maryland at Milan Puskar Stadium, but with the Big Ten nixing non-conference games, that meeting is tabled.</p>
<p>Holding an impromptu edition of the Backyard Brawl — a rivalry between two schools separated by 75 miles, especially timely with COVID-19 pushing regionalized matchups — seems to make sense. And it would be fun.</p>
<p>The problem is, the Panthers are still under contract with two programs that (as of now) intend on playing football in the fall. Pitt is/was scheduled to host Miami of Ohio on Sept. 5 and travel down to Marshall on Sept. 12.</p>
<p>However, as part of the ACC’s announcement, the conference stated that all non-conference games must be played in the home state of the ACC program, and opponents have to meet ACC medical protocol before playing. This would eliminate Pitt’s game at Marshall, at least this year, making the home game against Miami of Ohio even more likely.</p>
<p>Why? Money and legal documents are involved.</p>
<p><strong>Would Pitt be required to pay out lost “buy games”?</strong></p>
<p>Richmond is a private university and isn’t subject to public records requests. A direct request to Richmond athletics by the Post-Gazette for the two teams’ Sept. 19 game contract was respectfully declined. So for now, we’re in the dark there.</p>
<p>However, via the Miami of Ohio’s public records website, the Post-Gazette obtained the contract for Pitt’s opener against the RedHawks. The agreement, which was signed by Lyke in Jan. 2018, states that Miami of Ohio was set to receive $1.1 million from the Panthers for playing on Sept. 5 at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>And there is a noteworthy clause in the contract in regards to cancellations.</p>
<p>Section 9 of the contract reads: “If it becomes impossible to play the game for reasons of power failure, strikes, severe weather conditions, riots, wars, or other unforeseen catastrophes or disasters or circumstances beyond the control of a party hereto, the game shall be canceled, and neither party hereto shall be responsible to the other for any related loss or damage.”</p>
<p>Could you classify what’s going with COVID-19 as an “unforeseen catastrophe”? In that case, perhaps Pitt wouldn’t owe Miami of Ohio the agreed upon $1.1 million.</p>
<p>But MAC programs stand to lose more than $10.5 million as a direct result of the Big Ten’s conference-only decision, according to USA Today, and in some contracts, there’s room for interpretation — wiggle room for lawyers to potentially pursue payment. For example, with a non-conference game at its disposal, would playing the game in 2020 be “beyond the control” of Pitt?</p>
<p>According to Pitt and Miami of Ohio’s agreement, if the Panthers were deemed in breach of the contract, “reasonable and just compensation” would be the full $1.1 million. That possibility — and the difficulty of scheduling a different team to come and play at Heinz Field — should be enough to motivate Pitt to move the date back a few days and play the RedHawks in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to the Marshall game?</strong></p>
<p>In one of his final acts in charge, former Pitt athletic director Steve Pederson scheduled a home-and-home series with Marshall. The Panthers hosted Marshall on Oct. 1, 2016, a 43-27 win for Pat Narduzzi’s team. Pitt was supposed to complete the deal with a road trip on Sept. 12.</p>
<p>Through a public records request, the Post-Gazette obtained the home-and-home contract agreed upon by Pitt and Marshall in Sept. 2014, as well as a letter sent by Lyke to Marshall athletic director Mike Hamrick in April 2017 confirming the Panthers’ commitment to the deal.</p>
<p>In the contract, it states the home team would pay the away team $350,000. So, the Panthers were set to receive the same sum this year that it paid out in 2016. The contract also has the same “riots, wars, or other unforeseen catastrophes” clause that the Pitt-Miami of Ohio deal had.</p>
<p>So, if the game is simply canceled, Marshall would likely get out of paying Pitt the $350,000, a significant chunk of change for a Group of Five school in the midst of a pandemic. That is, if it wants the game canceled. Should Marshall want to reschedule for a later date, Pitt might have an out with that clause, if Lyke chooses to forfeit the payday and avoid playing a non-conference road game she didn’t originally schedule.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of ifs. For good measure, let’s toss another one in the mix. If the game is rescheduled, it would probably have to wait a while.</p>
<p>Pitt’s non-conference slate is full in 2021 and 2022, while the Panthers have road games at West Virginia in 2023 and 2025, at Cincinnati in 2024 and at Wisconsin in 2026. It’s hard to believe Lyke would be receptive to two non-conference away games in one season, especially one at Marshall that wouldn’t do much for the Panthers’ overall resume.</p>
<p>By that logic, the earliest Pitt could work Marshall in would be 2027, when Pitt hosts Wisconsin — and the players in that game are currently playing Call of Duty in their parents’ basement.</p>
<p><strong>Is this announcement delaying the inevitable?</strong></p>
<p>It certainly feels like it.</p>
<p>Look, there needs to be a season. Otherwise, football programs and athletic departments across the country, big and small, won’t be able to function properly. Some won’t survive without football. There’s too much financial stake tied to putting on a season, no matter how weird it may be.</p>
<p>But the undeniable truth is the ACC and Power Five conferences don’t know what the COVID-19 climate will be in September. Establishing this slate now buys the ACC some time to see where everything stands, some cushion to facilitate a pivot to a spring slate if absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>A spring football season has been referred to by some as the worst-case scenario. But obviously, the worst possible outcome for the sport would be no season at all.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the ACC will heed commissioner John Swofford’s words and take things day by day.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I feel like right now all we deal with is hypotheticals. And that’s a tough world to live in,” the commissioner said on May 14. “... I’ve been in this a long time. And intercollegiate athletics has never been in a more challenging situation in my career than it’s in now.”</p>
