<h1>McCoy Tyner | Jazz piano powerhouse, part of ‘classic’ Coltrane quartet </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>McCoy Tyner, a cornerstone of John Coltrane’s groundbreaking 1960s quartet and one of the most influential pianists in jazz history, died Friday at his home in northern New Jersey. He was 81.</p>
<p>His nephew Kolby Tyner confirmed the death. No other details were provided.</p>
<p>Along with Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and only a few others, Mr. Tyner was one of the main expressways of modern jazz piano. Nearly every jazz pianist since Mr. Tyner’s years with Coltrane has had to learn his lessons, whether they ultimately discarded them or not.</p>
<p>Mr. Tyner’s manner was modest, but his sound was rich, percussive and serious, his lyrical improvisations centered by powerful left-hand chords marking the first beat of the bar and the tonal center of the music.</p>
<p>That sound helped create the atmosphere of Coltrane’s music and, to some extent, all jazz in the 1960s.</p>
<p>To a great extent he was a grounding force for Coltrane. In a 1961 interview, about a year and a half after hiring Mr. Tyner, Coltrane said: “My current pianist, McCoy Tyner, holds down the harmonies, and that allows me to forget them. He’s sort of the one who gives me wings and lets me take off from the ground from time to time.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tyner did not find immediate success after leaving Coltrane in 1965. But within a decade his fame had caught up with his influence, and he remained one of the leading bandleaders in jazz as well as one of the most revered pianists for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Alfred McCoy Tyner was born in Philadelphia on Dec. 11, 1938, to Jarvis and Beatrice (Stephenson) Tyner, both natives of North Carolina. His father sang in a church quartet and worked for a company that made medicated cream; his mother was a beautician. Mr. Tyner started taking piano lessons at 13, and a year later his mother bought him his first piano, setting it up in her beauty shop.</p>
<p>He grew up during a spectacular period for jazz in Philadelphia. While still in high school Mr. Tyner began taking music theory lessons at the Granoff School of Music. At 16 he was playing professionally with a rhythm-and-blues band at house parties around Philadelphia and Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Mr. Tyner was in a band led by trumpeter Cal Massey in 1957 when he met Coltrane at a Philadelphia club called the Red Rooster. At the time, Coltrane, who grew up in Philadelphia but had left in 1955 to join Miles Davis’ quintet, was back in town, between tenures with the Davis band.</p>
<p>The two musicians struck up a friendship. Coltrane was living at his mother’s house, and Mr. Tyner would visit him there to sit on the porch and talk.</p>
<p>Like Coltrane, Mr. Tyner was a religious seeker: Raised Christian, he became a Muslim at 18. “My faith,” he said to journalist Nat Hentoff, “teaches peacefulness, love of God and the unity of mankind.” He added, “This message of unity has been the most important thing in my life, and naturally, it’s affected my music.”</p>
<p>In 1958, Coltrane recorded one of Mr. Tyner’s compositions, “The Believer.” There was an understanding between them that when Coltrane was ready to lead his own group, he would hire Mr. Tyner as his pianist.</p>
<p>Mr. Tyner was 21 when he joined the Coltrane quartet. He would remain — along with drummer Elvin Jones and, beginning in 1962, bassist Jimmy Garrison — for the next five years. Through his work with the group, which came to be known as the “classic” Coltrane quartet, he became one of the most widely imitated pianists in jazz.</p>
<p>When Coltrane began to expand his musical vision to include extra horns and percussionists, Mr. Tyner quit the group, at the end of 1965, complaining that the music had grown so loud and unwieldy that he could not hear the piano anymore. He was a member of drummer Art Blakey’s touring band in 1966 and 1967; otherwise he was a freelancer, living with his wife and three children in Queens.</p>
<p>Mr. Tyner’s survivors include his wife, Aisha Tyner; his son, Nurudeen, who is known as Deen; his brother, Jarvis; his sister, Gwendolyn-Yvette Tyner; and three grandchildren.</p>
<p>He moved to the Milestone label in 1972, an association that continued until 1981 and that brought him a higher profile and more success.</p>
<p>In 2002, Mr. Tyner was named an National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, one of the highest honors for a jazz musician in the United States.</p>
<p>He resisted analyzing or theorizing about his own work. He tended to talk more in terms of learning and life experience.</p>
<p>“To me,” he told Hentoff, “living and music are all the same thing. And I keep finding out more about music as I learn more about myself, my environment, about all kinds of different things in life.</p>
<p>“I play what I live. Therefore, just as I can’t predict what kinds of experiences I’m going to have, I can’t predict the directions in which my music will go. I just want to write and play my instrument as I feel.”</p>
