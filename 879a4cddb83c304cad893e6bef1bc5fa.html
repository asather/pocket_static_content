<h1>Pittsburgh Zoo names new clouded leopard cubs after longtime zoo docent </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium have given names to the newest members of its zoo family.</p>
<p>The zoo <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/12/23/pittsburgh-zoo-clouded-leopards-saya-pi-cubs-newborns/stories/201912230097" target="_blank">introduced two male clouded leopard cubs</a> in December that were born a month before to adult pair Saya and Pi. On Tuesday zoo officials said visitors can now identify the cubs as Gale and Lynn.</p>
<p>The names were chosen by Tamara Golden, daughter of long-time docent Gail Noden, to honor her mother who volunteered at the zoo for over four decades.</p>
<p>“In honor of my mother, who loved the zoo and volunteered as a zoo docent for 40 years, I am thrilled at the opportunity to keep her zoo legacy alive through the cubs,” Ms. Golden said, in a statement released by the zoo.</p>
<p>The cubs are now eight-weeks-old and are “healthy, growing and curious about everything,” according to the statement. Keepers had been caring for the cubs since shortly after Saya gave birth on Nov. 27 because the mother left her nesting box after one attempt at nursing.</p>
<p>Now, they’ve already been introduced to meat, and zoo officials said they love to wrestle and play with each other.</p>
<p>Visitors can catch Gale and Lynn in their day room at The Islands. Keepers plan to introduce them to the outside yard when the whether gets warm.</p>
