<p>The woman charged with kidnapping and killing toddler Nalani Johnson will stand trial.</p>
<p>All charges against Sharena Nancy, 25 of Penn Hills, were held for court after a preliminary hearing today. The charges include criminal homicide, kidnapping a minor, abused of corpse and other felonies.</p>
<p>Nalani was just shy of 2-years-old when she disappeared August 31, 2019. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/09/03/Nalani-Johnson-abduction-case-press-conference-kidnapping-Sharena-Nancy/stories/201909030092" target="_blank">Police discovered her body</a> near Pine Ridge Park in Indiana County almost three days later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Nancy had an on-and-off again relationship with the girl’s father, Paul D. Johnson, according to Allegheny County police. Ms. Nancy drove off with the child following an argument, and Mr. Johnson called the police, prompting an amber alert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police say Ms. Nancy claimed that Mr. John­son, sold her the child for $10,000, but there’s been no evidence to corroborate that account.</p>
<p>Coroners ruled the death a homicide, but an autopsy revealed <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/09/05/nalani-johnson-toddler-dead-allegheny-county-zappala/stories/201909040177" target="_blank">no signs of trauma</a>.</p>
