<h1>Tech companies impacted by COVID-19 could get a boost from state funding</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tech companies in Pennsylvania are slated to receive $4 million in funding from the state to provide economic relief from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Startups and tech companies, like many businesses, have struggled with decreased revenues, adjustments to predicted yearly outcomes and a switch to remote work.</p>
<p>Also like many businesses, startups have struggled to secure funding through government relief programs, but many founders and entrepreneurs have found these programs can be off-limits to them. Their business models often do not align with traditional requirements, like being able to prove a company will turn a profit and having investors sign up to take on responsibility if the company can’t pay back a loan on time.</p>
<p>“I think startups have been so important to the Pittsburgh region,” said Rich Lunak, president and CEO of Innovation Works, a supporter and investor in local startups. “Many of them are struggling in this current environment, and unfortunately, a lot of the traditional relief programs are more set up for established businesses and don’t work as well for startups.”</p>
<p>The state’s Department of Community and Economic Development is distributing $1 million to each of the four Ben Franklin Technology Partners, which work to promote entrepreneurs, economic growth and innovation. In Pittsburgh, Innovation Works serves as the region’s tech partner.</p>
<p>Each partner will match the funding and distribute $2 million to companies in their portfolio and, ideally, new companies, according to DCED Secretary Dennis Davin.</p>
<p>DCED is also making loans available to venture capital funds to invest in technology companies in Pennsylvania, ranging from $250,000 to $1 million.</p>
<p>Startups, already on precarious footing as they work to create brand-new companies, are certainly struggling. About 40% of global startups have less than three months’ worth of cash available, according to a report from Startup Genome that interviewed 1,070 respondents across 50 countries from March 25 to April 17.</p>
<p>Of those companies, 74% saw their revenues decline and the same amount have had to terminate full-time employees.</p>
<p>Of startups that already had entered into an informal deal with an investor, 20% have said the investor backed out and 53% have seen the process slow down or have faced an unresponsive investor.</p>
<p>“I would not call this business as usual at the moment,” said Zach Malone, a principal at Draper Triangle Ventures, a local investment firm. “I don’t think that’s unique for us. I think across the industry investors tend to favor stability and predictability.”</p>
<p>Right now, Draper Triangle is focusing on helping the companies already in its portfolio, Mr. Malone said. The firm is not opposed to doing new deals, but those are harder to orchestrate when investors can’t meet in person with founders.</p>
<p>“It’s a people-focused business,” he said. “We invest in the individuals as much as the business plan.”</p>
<p>“This is such an odd scenario where we really have no idea when the end will come, the unknowns,” Mr. Malone said. “You have to do what you can to conserve cash and wait for demand to come back and the world to start moving again.”</p>
<p>To conserve cash, many startups have turned to layoffs. Since March 11, 306 startups have laid off a total of 29,948 people, according to data that one entrepreneur has been collecting.</p>
<p>Roger Lee, co-founder of Human Interest in San Francisco, started keeping track of layoffs for his own benefit. Workers that have recently been laid off can make some of the best new hires, he said.</p>
<p>Layoffs peaked the first week of April, where 96 companies started layoffs and terminated 7,639 jobs, according to Mr. Lee’s data.</p>
<p>Since then, the numbers have gone down but are still high. From April 15 to April 21, 43 companies started layoffs and terminated 4,671 jobs.</p>
<p>The layoffs indicate startup executives worry “the fundraising market is going to dry up ... so we need to figure out a way to cut costs, extend our runway so we have enough time to wait this out until the economy improves again,” Mr. Lee said.</p>
<p>Of course, not all startups are following the trend. Downtown-based RoadRunner Recycling announced a $28.6 million Series C funding round March 17 and plans to double its team.</p>
<p>Seegrid, based in Findlay, raised a $25 million funding round at the end of March to accelerate new product development.</p>
<p>Duolingo, a language learning company based in East Liberty, has seen a spike in usage; it plans to ramp up hiring and has even rolled out new products during the pandemic. Co-founder Luis von Ahn said earlier this month Duolingo would likely delay its initial public offering as a result of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The new state funding to help tech companies in the region could be the first round in a series of investments, Mr. Davin, the&nbsp;DCED secretary,&nbsp;said Friday in a webinar discussing the new initiative.</p>
<p>Innovation Works hopes to make the new state funding available to as many as 40 companies in the next few weeks, Mr. Lunak said.</p>
<p>Companies that have received funding from other government relief programs, like the Paycheck Protection Program or other loans for small businesses, are still eligible for this funding.</p>
<p>Tech companies do not have to apply for the new funding, Mr. Lunak said. Instead, founders will continue working with Innovation Works to adapt their business plan and the organization will make a decision based on how much support the company needs as well as how viable its business plan was before COVID-19 and how viable it looks moving forward.</p>
<p>Innovation Works, which is matching the funding in part through a $150,000 award from the RK Mellon Foundation, is still accepting applications for its incubator programs from new startups.</p>
<p>“These additional resources make that money go further, because we were in a situation where we really had to divert pretty much everything to help support those existing companies,” Mr. Lunak said. “This will just give us the fuel and resources to meet the demand.”</p>
