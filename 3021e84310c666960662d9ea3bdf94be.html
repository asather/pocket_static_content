<h1>Analysis: Extra service time has rarely paid off with Pirates' top prospects</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Play the kids” is a natural rallying cry for fans of a bad baseball team because, c’mon, they need some hope that things will get better some day. And in the Pirates’ case, they’re not getting much of it watching veterans Jarrod Dyson and Gregory Polanco flail away at the plate as the team loses 16 of its first 20 games.</p>
<p>Sticking top prospects in their place isn’t that simple from a management standpoint, though. General manager Ben Cherington and his ilk need to give consideration to practical matters like service time clocks, which govern how quickly young players like Cole Tucker and Ke’Bryan Hayes can reach free agency.</p>
<p>Usually, teams can hold on to players for their first six seasons via compulsory league minimum deals and the cost-limiting arbitration process, but they can extend that number to seven by manipulating call-up dates so that rookies are credited for less than a full season under MLB’s collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>This is why top Pirates prospects of recent vintage have typically made their debuts in June or later, rather than appearing on opening day rosters. That extra year of control can be quite valuable to cash-strapped teams like them that typically can’t compete to retain their productive players’ services in pricey open market bidding wars.</p>
<p>History, however, shows that such value tends to exist more in the theoretical realm. Contract extensions, trades and other transactions tend to resolve players’ long-term fates here long before they get to their seventh year of club control.</p>
<p>So as the Pirates weigh whether to bring prospects like Hayes along amid an apparently lost 2020 season, here’s a look back at how they’ve handled players like him over the past decade-plus.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew McCutchen, 2009 —</strong>&nbsp;It was easy enough for the club to justify keeping its 2005 first-round pick at Class AAA because All-Star Nate McLouth was already patrolling center field in the spring of 2009. But that changed quickly once June rolled around and McCutchen’s extra year of control was assured. McLouth was abruptly dealt while McCutchen took over in center and began his ascent to MVP status. That extra year never came close to mattering, though. The Pirates gave him a long-term extension less than three years later that bought out multiple years of potential free agency and kept McCutchen here through age 30, the point at which most hitters begin to decline.</p>
<p><strong>Neil Walker 2009 —</strong>&nbsp;The 2004 first-round pick and Pine-Richland product is an unusual case, promoted first as a September call-up in 2009, then as a late-May replacement for the injured Steve Pearce on the big club’s roster the following year. Still, the Pirates were able to manipulate his service time just enough that they held his rights for a seventh full season in 2016, making him the only player in this group to even get even that close to leaving via free agency. Instead, he was traded to the New York Mets in the offseason for Jon Niese, a starter who flamed out spectacularly and failed to realize the value the Pirates hoped they could create by leveraging that additional year of Walker into more of someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Pedro Alvarez, 2010 —</strong>&nbsp;The Pirates were very careful with their 2008 first-round pick, selected second overall. Even as his college pedigree put him on a fast track the majors, they kept him in Class AAA longer than many had hoped, waiting until June 16 to promote him to what became a 105-loss team. That bought them an extra year of control they’d never end up using. Alvarez’s 23 errors in 2015 prompted them to cut him loose rather than tender him a 2016 offer he’d have been obligated to either accept or haggle over in arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>Starling Marte, 2012 —</strong>&nbsp;The Pirates probably could have used his production in place of pedestrian names like Jose Tabata, Alex Presley and Drew Sutton during a 2012 season that saw them take a division lead into July. Instead, he stayed in the minors until things began to slip away later that month. His promotion on July 26 included fireworks — he hit a homer in his first at-bat against Houston. But the team around him fell apart in the final two months and finished well behind its early pace. In the end, his delayed arrival ended up mattering very little in the longer-term picture. He was locked up less than two years later on a deal that’s still paying him today at age 31, albeit as a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Pirates ended up getting the bulk of his prime, regardless of their service time manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>Gerrit Cole, 2013 —</strong>&nbsp;The former first overall pick of the MLB draft was a Scott Boras client from the start, a signal that he’d never sign a long-term deal like McCutchen and Marte and instead test free agency as soon as possible. That made the Pirates decision to keep him in the minors until June of 2013 seem reasonable, even in the thick of a division race. There was legitimate reason to believe it could extend their window to hold onto a potential ace starter. That’s not how things played out, though. Instead, general manager Neal Huntington traded him to Houston with two full years of control remaining in the winter of 2018. In this case, that extra year actually helped him at the negotiating table, in all likelihood, giving Houston two postseason runs of value with Cole instead of one. But for the Pirates’ purposes, it probably only pushed their timeline of a deal back slightly, considering their roster was already declining into the depths of ineptitude that we’re seeing in 2020. And it came, arguably, at the cost of an NL Central title, as the Pirates finished just three games behind the Cardinals that year in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Gregory Polanco, 2014 —</strong>&nbsp;A third case almost exactly like McCutchen and Marte’s, except without the production. Fans clamored for Polanco’s promotion for months in 2014. He was absolutely tearing up the minors while the big club was trotting out the likes of Tabata and Travis Snider. He finally arrived in early June, but his minor league success never translated. He hit just .235 for a team that eked out a wild card spot. Still, the Pirates extended him less than two years later, buying out all of his team control and free agency into his 10th season in 2023, if he makes it that far. He was hitting just .070 with 22 strikeouts in 49 at bats through Wednesday. In the end, the Pirates might wish they didn’t lock him down for so long.</p>
<p><strong>Jameson Taillon and Josh Bell (2016) —</strong>&nbsp;We don’t know how their tenures with the Pirates will end yet. We do know that they’ve been far from smooth rides. Taillon has been beset by injuries plus a cancer diagnosis since he was drafted a decade ago this summer. It remains to be seen how much value the team will be able to mine from the extra year of control they bought by delaying his arrival until June of 2016. Bell, meanwhile, seems unlikely to re-sign here as a Boras client. He’s certainly shown flashes, riding a historically productive May to an All-Star bid and Home Run Derby appearance in 2019. Beyond that, though, he’s been largely inconsistent and could find himself a trade candidate like Cole before him. Mark these two cases as inconclusive for now, but certainly far from sure bets to prove the value of added service time.</p>
