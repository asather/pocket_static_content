<h1>Pittsburgh Promise hopes coaches in schools will boost eligibility</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Promise has invested about $140 million in more than 9,500 students who have gone on to college since its inception in 2008.</p>
<p>Going into the future, the goal is to get an even greater number of students to take advantage of the scholarship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s not an overstatement to say that education is a justice issue,” said Saleem Ghubril, executive director of The Pittsburgh Promise. “Everything depends on education, whether it is employability, whether it is economic mobility or whether it’s health of family and stability.”</p>
<p>In an effort to boost more students into eligibility, The Pittsburgh Promise on Wednesday unveiled a plan to implant professionals into three city high schools who will focus on providing postsecondary preparation and planning assistance to every student at each school starting in ninth grade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The four-year pilot program, which was announced at a press conference at The Pittsburgh Promise’s Hill District office, will bring so-called “Promise coaches” to Perry, Milliones and Carrick high schools.</p>
<p>The Promise coaches will serve all students at the schools but place particular attention toward those who risk falling below or are below eligibility. Students eligible for The Promise must have graduated from a Pittsburgh Public Schools high school with an unweighted 2.5 GPA and at least 90% attendance.</p>
<p>Perry, Milliones and Carrick were selected for the program because the usage rate for The Pittsburgh Promise at those high schools were low.</p>
<p>For the class of 2008, the usage rate was&nbsp;38% at Carrick, 18% at Milliones and 11% at Perry. Mr. Ghubril said the program aims to&nbsp;increase usage by two-thirds&nbsp;at Carrick, double it at Milliones and triple it at Perry.</p>
<p>“We didn’t arrive at those numbers randomly — those aren’t pie in the sky numbers,” Mr. Ghubril said. “Our research partners at the University of Pittsburgh at the Learning Research and Development Center helped us do a study of what’s happening across the country and what is reasonable for us to project with the kind of investment that we are making.”</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Promise partnered with the Pittsburgh Public Schools as well as Carlow University and Community College of Allegheny County for the program. The colleges will use that funding for analytics that will help students and support the cohort of promise students who enroll at their schools.</p>
<p>“The Promise coach partnership with CCAC will expand and institutionalize a comprehensive academic support and mentoring structure to advance the college completions rate for Promise Extension students and Promise scholars,” said Quintin Bullock, president of CCAC. “Together, we’re helping to provide resources and interventions to ensure all students, regardless of background or income, have the tools that they need to succeed.”</p>
<p>According to The Promise, Carlow and CCAC accept a large number of the students who are at-risk of missing out on the scholarship. So the colleges will also hire coaches to help the city school students who enroll at those colleges keep them career-focused.</p>
<p>“Because they’re taking greater risks on our kids, we’re also going to place coaches at their institutions,” Mr. Ghubril said. “They will be their employees, working for them, but they are dedicated to serve the population of kids that we are helping to move from not eligible to eligible from not able to get the scholarship to barely able to get it in some cases where they’re still going to be vulnerable and will need the additional supports.”</p>
<p>The Richard King Mellon Foundation is providing $3.9 million to fund the program,&nbsp;$2 million of which will go to The Pittsburgh Promise, and just under $1 million each to Carlow and CCAC. Mr. Ghubril said The Promise would need to raise about $3 million more for scholarships if the program is a success.</p>
<p>“The beautiful thing about this — not if, but when, we’re successful — the demand on our scholarship fund is going to be increased,” Mr. Ghubril said.</p>
<p>The Promise coaches will help students in five areas: identifying their skills and interests; finding out what resources are available, financial or otherwise; understanding their options; navigating the marketplace; and developing their work habits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When The Promise approached us with this idea it was an immediate and easy ‘yes,’” Pittsburgh Public Schools Superintendent Anthony Hamlet said. “This provides equity and opportunity for our students. I also want to make sure we access students who are normally going to have the supports in place but also need additional support.”</p>
