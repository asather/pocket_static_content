<h1>Allegheny County court employees have safety concerns after at least 10 test positive for COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At least 10 people who work in the Allegheny County court system have tested positive for COVID-19 since June 25, and attorneys and other staff members are concerned that the administration has not done enough to keep them informed or safe.</p>
<p>Those complaining say that after potential exposure to a staffer who tested positive, they were not contacted quickly enough, and that court administration, instead of allowing employees to work from home, were still requiring them to report to the courthouse&nbsp;— and in some cases, use the workspaces of other employees who were self-quarantining.</p>
<p>On June 25, a staffer who had been working in criminal division in Judge Susan Evashavik-DiLucente’s courtroom tested positive. Court staff, as well as prosecutors and public defenders who appeared in that room, were informed of the situation; however, private defense attorneys who appeared there said they learned about a potential exposure only through word of mouth.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Defense attorney Owen Seman was one of those people. Three days after that potential exposure, he had in-person jail visits scheduled in Greensburg and Crawford County.</p>
<p>Fearful that he could potentially spread the virus if he’d been infected, Mr. Seman canceled both his visits and got tested.</p>
<p>His test came back negative, he said.</p>
<p>“It was a scare for me because I could have taken it to jails in other counties, and nobody from Allegheny County told us anything.”</p>
<p>Defense attorney Rachael Santoriella said when she went to Judge Evashavik-DiLucente’s room to sign a subpoena on June 25, the staff members there were not wearing masks, and no one mentioned that the staffer had tested positive.</p>
<p>“I’m finding this out after the fact,” Ms. Santoriella said. “It’s all through a rumor mill, and that’s what’s outrageous.”</p>
<p>Private criminal defense attorney Patrick Nightingale is advocating for more transparency from the courts for the attorneys who appear there.</p>
<p>“I will not go back until we have some reasonable ways to address these concerns,” he said. “We don’t understand how no one has reached out to us.</p>
<p>“The defense bar are those at greatest risk of taking this throughout the county and the commonwealth.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Court Administrator Chris Connors said court administration is working on a plan to communicate positive test results to the members of the bar on an ongoing basis — while maintaining privacy for the person who tested positive.</p>
<p>Ms. Santoriella noted that court administration has the email addresses of members of the defense bar, and it would be easy to notify them.</p>
<p>“They’re not informing anyone,” she said.</p>
<p>Sunday evening, after a Facebook post by Mr. Nightingale in the morning brought attention to the issue, President Judge Kim Berkeley Clark and Mr. Connors emailed court staff.</p>
<p>“The rapid rise in positive COVID-19 tests over the last week in Allegheny County, coupled with some positive tests for people involved with the court system, has raised serious concerns for all of us,” they wrote. “We wanted to take this opportunity to explain the process that has been implemented when a court employee tests positive.”</p>
<p>The email went on to describe contact tracing done by the county health department as well as the court system’s own, independent contact tracing done by human resources.</p>
<p>As for employees who may have been exposed, the administration’s email said it is taking a “more conservative approach” to protect employees and the public.</p>
<p>“The court has instructed and will instruct employees to stay at home or work from home even when they do not meet the ‘close contact’ definition under CDC guidelines,” the email said. “The court may instruct employees to stay at home or work from home even when they report being a further distance away from someone for a lesser period of time.”</p>
<p>The email went on to say that each situation will be evaluated individually, considering all the circumstances of exposure, including “distance, duration, size of room, whether masks were worn, etc., to determine who should remain home and who should be notified. The notification includes court employees, attorneys and others. To date, none of the employees who have been asked to stay home out of an abundance of caution have tested positive and many have tested negative.”</p>
<p>There have been positive cases in the criminal courthouse, in family division, in pretrial services, as well as in the City-County Building, the statement from Mr. Connors said. Six are in the courthouse and the others in different offices.</p>
<p>Three lawyers in the district attorney’s office have tested positive.</p>
<p>“[A]s we have consistently done since the start of this pandemic, we will review the safety measures that have been implemented to determine where improvements need to be made,” said DA’s spokesman, Mike Manko.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Chief Deputy Sheriff Kevin Kraus said a civilian employee in his office also tested positive, and eight sheriff’s detectives are in quarantine.</p>
<p>Chief Kraus said it is believed that the employee who tested positive was exposed at his place of secondary employment.</p>
<p>An employee at the magisterial district office of Judge Anthony DeLuca in Penn Hills on Universal Road tested positive Sunday, and that office will be closed for two weeks, Mr. Connors said.</p>
<p>In addition, because of the large increase in the number of positive cases being reported in the county, court administration closed four adult probation community resource centers on Thursday. The officers who work there are working from home.</p>
<p>When the courts were initially preparing to reopen in late May, the administration said it was attempting to limit the number of people in the courthouse —&nbsp;by conducting hearings via video teleconferencing. That included not having inmates from the jail transported there.</p>
<p>However, since June 8, when Allegheny County returned to the green phase, a total of 124 inmates have been taken to the courthouse.</p>
<p>On Monday, Chief Kraus said on a normal day prior to COVID-19, 40 to 70 inmates might be transported.</p>
<p>Mr. Connors said jail transports are down significantly, and many plea hearings for inmates have been conducted by videoconference.</p>
<p>Other employees have also raised concerns about staffers not wearing masks&nbsp;— as that May order dictated.</p>
<p>On June 26, Judge Clark sent an email to Allegheny County’s judges, reminding them that wearing a mask is mandatory.</p>
<p>“I have received reports that not everyone, including judges, is wearing a mask or face covering during court proceedings. I have also received reports that courtrooms and hallways are overcrowded.</p>
<p>“Masking only works if everyone does it. As the saying goes, ‘My mask protects you&nbsp;— your mask protects me.’ Not wearing a mask is disrespectful and sends a message to the public and attorneys, that we care more about our personal comfort than we do about their safety,” she wrote. “Failure to socially distance sends the same message.</p>
<p>“So again, I am asking you to be a leader and comply with the court order.”</p>
<p>Concerned employees interviewed pushed for wearing masks and use of video hearings.</p>
<p>Ms. Santoriella agreed.</p>
<p>“There is nothing going on in that building that is so dire that we can’t do it by video,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Mr. Connors said working from home in the criminal division and magistrate courts is more difficult because staff need to process cases and be available to the public.</p>
<p>“When we ask such staffers to work from home, we have to postpone cases or substitute other employees,” he said. “We have been encouraging and continue to encourage the increased use of Microsoft Teams for matters, but due to the volume and nature of the cases, this has been more difficult in the Criminal Division than in other divisions.”</p>
