<h1>Shale drillers are staring down the barrel of the worst oil bust yet</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>America’s shale drillers have never faced an oil bust quite like this.</p>
<p>The split between Russia and its one-time OPEC allies last week has ignited an all-out price war. U.S. crude prices plunged the most since the 1990s, falling to less than $28 a barrel and rendering vast swathes of the U.S. oil industry unprofitable.</p>
<p>Shares and bonds of shale producers plunged Monday, with the S&amp;P 500 Energy Index posting its worst intraday decline on record.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a disaster for many U.S. frackers including Chesapeake Energy Corp. and Whiting Petroleum Corp., who were already trading at distressed levels — and makes more defaults and bankruptcies all but certain.</p>
<p>After burning through hundreds of billions of dollars in cash over the past decade, the industry has consistently disappointed investors while accumulating huge debts. It now finds itself backed into a corner, increasingly shut out of capital markets. Banks were already poised to cut credit lines after writing off as much as $1 billion in shale loans last year, more than they have in 30 years of making them.</p>
<p>But if there was a bright spot in Monday’s market mayhem, it was mostly concentrated in southwestern Pennsylvania, where regional shale gas producers such as EQT Corp. and CNX Corp. saw their share prices increase by almost 10% and 7% respectively.</p>
<p>Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corp., which drills for natural gas in northeastern Pennsylvania, also enjoyed a 3% bump, while the overall S&amp;P oil and gas producers’ index plunged by 37% in one day.</p>
<p>These industry outliers — who concentrate on producing dry natural gas from Appalachian shales — would be less impacted by falling oil prices, the markets reasoned. In fact, the expected decline of U.S. oil production will have an associated benefit for Marcellus and Utica dry gas producers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, companies that produce oil from shale also produce enough natural gas to nearly rival Appalachian gas production. This associated gas is often sold at very low prices — it’s more a byproduct than a target — and has contributed to the glut of natural gas by competing with companies who are actually focused on gas production.</p>
<p>The boom-and-bust cycle is as old as the oil industry itself.</p>
<p>The current price crash has echoes of 1986, when Saudi Arabia abandoned attempts to prop up a glutted market and pumped at will — sending oil futures plunging by more than half in a matter of months.</p>
<p>But never before has so much U.S. output been in such peril — and never has demand for that supply been so uncertain. When financial markets collapsed in 2008-2009, dragging crude demand and prices down with them, America’s shale patch as it is now didn’t exist. Oil drillers in the Permian were just warming up to the idea of hydraulic fracturing.</p>
<p>When oil tumbled to a 13-year low in early 2016, driven by a glut of supplies worldwide, the fracking revolution was in full swing. But demand was strong and the region had still not yet topped 2 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>Today, the Permian churns out more than 5 million barrels, exceeding Iraq and accounting for more than one-third of America’s total production. Shale companies weathered the last major downturn in 2018 by getting lean and plowing forward with drilling plans. This time, they’re in a more precarious financial position and can’t afford to keep adding to a glut.</p>
<p>American shale companies are largely responsible for years of swelling world supply. Indirectly, they’ve been supported by OPEC nations and their allies cutting production to prop up prices. But the key Saudi-Russia “bromance,” as it was once described by Citigroup Inc. oil analyst Ed Morse, is over. No longer is Russia willing to bail out U.S. shale.</p>
<p>Ominously, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in Vienna on Friday that his nation’s producers will be free to pump at will when current production caps expire at the end of the month. Saudi Arabia in turn started an all-out oil price war on Saturday, slashing its official selling prices by the most in 20 years in an effort to push as many barrels into the market as possible.</p>
<p>That leaves American shale drillers scant time to prepare for an onslaught from the rest of the world’s oil behemoths.</p>
<p>“The vultures already are circling,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who is frequently sought out by OPEC ministers and industry leaders for her views on oil. “What is the appetite for investors to refinance a new round of shale?”</p>
<p>Shale drillers are being pummeled by equity investors. After big drops on Friday, most of the 57 members of the S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production Select Industry Index fell Monday. Shale producers Oasis Petroleum Inc., California Resources Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. tumbled more than 40%.</p>
<p>Energy bonds also plummeted, with the average spread over Treasuries for companies in the Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Energy index surging above 10% for the first time since 2016, a threshold typically associated with distress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Junk-bond sales in the U.S. had already slowed to a trickle, with just three deals pricing in the past two weeks, none of them oil or gas companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Following Friday’s decimation of shale stocks, KPMG International’s Global Head of Energy Regina Mayor said she sees a buying opportunity. “I do not think this is the death of shale,” she said. “I think it’s a good time to buy.”</p>
<p>But for many observers, the path ahead for the U.S. shale sector appears to be painful and uncertain. Even before Friday’s dramatic events, some forecasters, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., expected global oil demand to shrink in 2020 for only the fourth time in nearly 40 years due to the effects of the coronavirus. A rationalization of the hundreds of independent U.S. producers currently active appears inevitable, according to Ian Nieboer, managing director of RS Energy, now part of Enverus.</p>
<p>“What we’re going to end up with is a major hollowing out of the industry,” he said.</p>
