<h1>Paul Zeise: With Kobe Bryant's death, we were again reminded of life's fragility</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As news of Kobe Bryant’s tragic death began to spread across the internet, I got a text message from my daughter, Hailey, that hit me right between the eyes and brought me to tears.</p>
<p>“OMG Dad, I love you so much, please take care of yourself....”</p>
<p>I didn’t even have to ask, I knew what it was about. She had just heard the news of Bryant and wanted to make sure she told me she loved me in case one of us isn’t here tomorrow. It is a morbid thought, but I think one we often don’t want to think about unless we are confronted with the realities of death like we were this weekend.</p>
<p>The Bryant story, much like the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/hsother/2019/05/09/maclean-maund-tyler-horvat-dan-miller-penn-trafford-warriors-baseball/stories/201905070105" target="_blank">sad story of Seton Hill pitcher MacLean Maund</a>, is one we can all relate to because of the tragic and sudden way so many young people with so much life left died. It isn’t about the fact that Bryant was a great basketball player or even that Maund was a standout in the WPIAL, it was their story —and the story of the others on board Bryant’s Helicopter Sunday — we could all relate to.</p>
<p>Hailey, who is a basketball player at Stony Brook University, said the story really hit home with her. She didn’t talk to me about how many points Bryant scored or how many championships he won, either. It was the fact that he was with his daughter, Gianna, going to a basketball game, and now they are gone. And she tried to get out of her head the image of Bryant holding his daughter as the helicopter crashed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She talked about the number of times her and I hit the road for AAU basketball events, the amount of time we spent together and bonded because of basketball and how lucky we are that we always made it safely. And then she reminded me that we don’t talk nearly enough on the phone and that is something that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>That’s why stories like these hit so close to home for so many people.</p>
<p>We all have families, we all have loved ones, we all know people who have volunteered their time to try and make a difference as coaches or mentors or teachers. We all have friends who have families and have followed their kids’ exploits either in sports or in other walks of life.</p>
<p>Maund was a freshman in college. He hadn’t even really begun his life yet; he was just making his own way and finding the independence that comes when a teenager goes away to college. As a father of six, I can’t imagine what it is like to get that phone call or knock on the door from the police who are delivering the horrific news. It breaks my heart to think about it, and I don’t even know Maund or his family.</p>
<p>But that’s the thing — we don’t need to know the actual people involved in these kinds of tragedies to be able to relate. Bryant and his daughter were on their way to a basketball game, something Hailey and I have done hundreds of times.</p>
<p>I have a son away at college who, like Maund, is an athlete, and I pray every day he is safe. I coach a girls basketball team and can’t imagine what the other players on that Mamba Academy team are going through knowing three of their teammates died Sunday.</p>
<p>We all probably know a family like the Altobellis. John was a long-time community college baseball coach. He and his wife, Kerri, had three kids, the youngest being 13-year old Alyssa, who was a member of the Mamba team and a teammate of Gianna. All three of them died in the crash with Bryant, so there are two kids who lost both parents and their younger sister in one day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Mauser and his three children, ages 11, 9 and 3 saw their life change forever in an instant because his wife — and their mother — Christina was a coach on the Mamba team. She, too, died in that crash, as did Sarah Chester and her 13-year old daughter, Payton, who was a member of the team. And the pilot, Ara Zobayan, by all accounts was a beloved man and successful flight instructor.</p>
<p>That is five families and hundreds of family friends touched by one tragedy. You don’t have to be a sports fan to feel pain and hurt because of it. You don’t have to actually know any of these people, either. If you have lived on this planet, you know people like them and you probably can relate to them all in some way.</p>
<p>I shed some tears Sunday, not because one of the greatest basketball players of all-time died. It was because a father of four daughters, three young girls, a husband and wife, the mother of three, and a pilot just doing his job all died. It was because a teenager died in a car crash and I can’t imagine what it is like to lose a child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is easy to relate to all of these stories and it is easy to understand why these things tend to hit us so hard. Life is precious and short, and these are the things that hit us all any time a tragedy occurs that involves people who die way too young.</p>
<p>There are plenty of takeaways from all of this, but the most important may be this: Hug your loved ones a little tighter each day and tell them how much they mean to you every chance you get, and make sure you make each day count.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
