<h1>NHL releases more details on return-to-play format</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NHL put the finishing touches on its 24-team, return-to-play format Thursday, when the league announced details about series length, reseeding and the specifics of a three-game round robin.</p>
<p>After the best-of-five qualifying round, all other rounds will be best-of-seven. The league had initially considered best-of-five in the so-called “first round” of 16 teams and “second round” of eight. But the players were in favor of longer series, including Penguins player rep Kris Letang.</p>
<p>“Everyone is used to best-of-seven,” Letang said last week on a conference call with Pittsburgh reporters. “You know how it feels when you lose the first two or win the first two. You know all the scenarios you can go through in a best-of-seven.”</p>
<p>Secondly, the league had considered a straight bracket-style tournament. But after pushback from players, the NHL decided that every round will be reseeded. For example, the No. 5 seeded Penguins are slated to play the No. 4 seed if they advance past the qualifying round. If the No. 12 seeded Montreal Canadiens upset the Penguins, they will instead play the No. 1 seed.</p>
<p>Finally, speaking of seeding, the top four teams in each conference will earn a bye to the first round. But they won’t just be sitting around. While the qualifying round is going on, the top four teams will compete in a three-game round robin to determine who earns the top four seeds. Regular season points percentage will serve as the tiebreaker. This means that after the qualifying round, the Penguins could play either the Boston Bruins, Tampa Bay Lightning, Washington Capitals or Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the players and the league have only agreed upon the format. Even with these last details of the 24-team plan ironed out, there are still a number of questions that need to be answered and hurdles to be cleared before the league can officially resume. Letang said last week the two main discussion points deal with player safety and whether players will be able to bring their families to the hub cities. Additionally, the league still needs to announce where those hub cities will be and possible dates for a return.</p>
<p>As it stands now, the NHL plans to move into Phase 2 sometime this month, during which players can skate in small groups. Phase 3, which will be a formal training camp period, won’t begin until mid-July or later. Most players estimate a training camp will need to be at least three weeks. Even with the format finalized, hockey won’t return to our TV screens until August — or later.</p>
