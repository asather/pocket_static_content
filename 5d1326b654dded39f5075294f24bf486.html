<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Uniontown man already charged by state police in connection with the posting of online videos of himself in sex acts with a minor has been charged in federal court with related child porn counts.</p>
<p>Zachary Bosh appeared briefly Wednesday before a U.S. magistrate judge and is set for a preliminary hearing and detention hearing on Friday.</p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Cynthia Reed Eddy ordered that an affidavit in the case remain sealed from the public, but the charges relate to production and distribution of child porn stemming from an incident on April 12, 2019.</p>
<p>The federal complaint was filed Feb. 28 under seal.</p>
<p>Mr. Bosh, 35, was arrested April 15 by state troopers on indecent assault charges related to videotaping himself and the underage girl and posting the images online.</p>
<p>State police in Uniontown made the arrest after receiving a tip from the FBI that Bosh had posted the videos in a chatroom.</p>
<p>Troopers arrested Bosh and took possession of physical evidence from his home.</p>
<p>Judge Eddy ordered that Mr. Bosh remain in custody.</p>
