<h1>Joe Musgrove: Sign stealing more than an Astros issue</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span>BRADENTON, Fla. — It’s not just the Astros, Joe Musgrove said.</span></p>
<p>Speaking Tuesday at Pirate City, Musgrove discussed the Astros’ sign-stealing scandal, specifically whether the World Series championship he helped Houston win in 2017 is “tainted,” the abundance of sign stealing around Major League Baseball and also what happens next.</p>
<p>Musgrove, per his usual, did not hold back.</p>
<p>“If MLB did an investigation as thorough as they did on the Astros with every team in baseball, they’re going to find a lot more than they want to find,” Musgrove said, later explaining that the Astros in 2017 caught multiple teams trying to steal their signs, too.</p>
<p>Musgrove was a reliever on that team.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I think everyone just tries to get the upper hand,” Musgrove said. “When you surround people with that much technology and you put it where it’s that available and that accessible, at some point someone is going to take advantage of it.”</span></p>
<p>And the Astros did, using algorithms and trash cans to decode signs and signal what pitch was coming, a scheme that ultimately cost general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch their jobs and has led to the pointed criticism of players on that team, whether or not they were involved.</p>
<p>“I don’t consider myself a cheater,” Musgrove said. “I had no part in that. I’m a pitcher. I didn’t benefit from it at all. I was in the bullpen for most of the season, so I didn’t even really see what was actually going on.”</p>
<p>Does the revelation that the Astros cheated destroy what they accomplished that season?</p>
<p>“I don’t want to say it’s tainted,” Musgrove said, “but I think it is.”</p>
<p>As a result of what Houston and the 2018 Boston Red Sox did, Major League Baseball tightened security around video rooms this past season, another thing that has been discussed often in this whole mess.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Musgrove expects that sort of presence will only increase in 2020 and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Security is going to go up more,” Musgrove said. “Even last year, they loaded up the video rooms and the clubhouse with monitors, people walking around to make sure that nobody is where they shouldn’t be.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“After what happened, I think it’s probably going to progress to more than that.”</span></p>
<p>It has also been suggested by some — including Pirate David Freese — that the Astros should lose their World Series rings and any mention of that championship should be expunged from baseball’s records.</p>
<p>Musgrove doesn’t seem to agree with that, but he said he’s definitely glad he got out of Houston when he did.</p>
<p>“A team cheats one time and gets caught, you could say the same thing as a team that maybe cheats the whole season and gets caught,” Musgrove said. “I don’t know that there’s a right or wrong answer. It’s not up to me, and I’m glad it’s not.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to be out of there. I think everything has been handled already. MLB’s report was even more than I knew was going on. I’m still finding out stuff.”</p>
