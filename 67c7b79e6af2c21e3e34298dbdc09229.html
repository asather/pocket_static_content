<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man tried to kill himself by attempting to ignite a parked vehicle’s gas tank in the Pentagon parking lot Monday, according to federal prosecutors.</p>
<p>Matthew Richardson, 19, of Arkansas has his first appearance in Alexandria, Virginia, federal court Tuesday afternoon on a charge of trying to set a vehicle on fire. If convicted, he faces at least five years in prison.</p>
<p>At about 10:45 Monday morning, a Pentagon police officer came upon Richardson in the Pentagon’s northern parking lot, according to court records, where he was attempting to use a cigarette lighter to ignite a piece of fabric that was inserted into the gas tank of a gray Land Rover.</p>
<p>The officer reported that when he approached, Richardson said he was going to “blow this vehicle up” and “himself.”</p>
<p>The Land Rover belongs to an active-duty service member who authorities say does not know Richardson.</p>
<p>The officer tried to detain Richardson, who fled on foot across Route 27 and into Arlington National Cemetery; he was arrested about an hour later on the grounds of the former home of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.</p>
<p>He had on him court documents indicating that he had been arrested in Arlington over the weekend for assaulting a law enforcement officer, according to prosecutors. Court records indicate that he was set to appear in Arlington on Wednesday for that case.</p>
