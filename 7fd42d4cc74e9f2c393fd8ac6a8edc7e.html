<p>Dick’s Sporting Goods is opening two concept stores, including a clearance warehouse in Bethel Park, at a time when states are easing their COVID-19 restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bethel Park location — in a former Toys R Us — at Village Square Mall near South Hills Village is a temporary pop-up-style store that will offer discounts on footwear and apparel of up to 90% off, according to the company.</p>
<p>The Warehouse Sale store is one of five that the Findlay-based retailer is opening. Other locations are in Ohio, Indiana, Missouri and Wisconsin. The stores will be open for six months.</p>
<p>The other concept store, dubbed Overtime, is an outlet center offering footwear, apparel and equipment for up to 75% off.</p>
<p>Three locations opening this week — in Philadelphia; Hagerstown, Md.; and Plainville, Conn. — are expected to “operate in these communities for the foreseeable future,” the company said. Dick’s opened clearance stores last year in Michigan, South Carolina and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>In total, the retailer has 11 outlet and clearance centers open in nine states.</p>
<p>After temporarily shuttering its brick-and-mortar stores to help curb the COVID-19 pandemic on March 18, Dick’s Sporting Goods <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/06/03/Dicks-Sporting-Goods-earnings-Q1-2020-COVID-19-reopen-stores-online-sales/stories/202006030049" target="_blank">had reopened about 80%</a> of its 851 locations by the end of May.</p>
<p>During that time, online sales spiked 110% compared to the same period last year. That figure includes the company’s new curbside contactless pickup service. Online sales made up about 39% of total net sales, compared to about 13% during the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>While online sales surged, the company also reported a $28 million writedown of inventory resulting from the temporary store closures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opening the doors at a brick-and-mortar store <a href="/%20https:/www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/05/22/retail-reopen-covid-19-coronavirus-regulations-pennsylvania-shoppers-consumer/stories/202005230023" target="_blank">takes a lot of thought</a> these days.&nbsp;In an earnings call with analysts on June 2, Dick’s Sporting Goods executives said in reopened stores, they’ve enhanced sanitizing protocols and require face masks for employees. Other measures include limiting the number of people in the store and installing Plexiglas screens at checkout.&nbsp;</p>
