<h1>Pennsylvania joins 6-state council that will recommend when to restart economy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Six northeast states, including Pennsylvania, are forming a council to determine the best way to crank up the economy after a shutdown of commerce that has paralyzed the U.S. for weeks.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday announced that the coalition will determine when and how to reopen businesses, schools and other public institutions in a way that doesn’t risk spreading the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Formation of the council came the same day President Donald Trump sought to take control of the coronavirus response by saying the federal government —&nbsp;not the states — would make the decision about when to open businesses. Asked about that assertion, Mr. Cuomo said he would welcome the opportunity to review the federal plan.</p>
<p>“What does that mean when the federal government says it will open each state,” Mr. Cuomo said. “We’re reopening with a plan and a smart plan, doing it in a coordinated way, as a cooperative effort.”</p>
<p>Whether Mr. Trump is successful in wresting control from the governors will require a careful interpretation of federal authority during a crisis, Mr. Cuomo said.</p>
<p>Serving on the 18-member council will be Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine, state Department of Community and Economic Development Dennis Davin and Gov. Tom Wolf’s chief of staff Mike Brunelle.</p>
<p>Participation of economic development officials is considered key to reversing a slump that one economist has compared to the Great Depression of the last century.</p>
<p>“The state boundaries mean very little to this virus,” Mr. Cuomo said during a call with other governors. “We anticipate different facts, different circumstances for each state.”</p>
<p>Health, economic development and chiefs of staff from the other five states will also serve on the council, which will make recommendations about restarting each state’s economy based on public health and economic considerations.</p>
<p>Details weren’t released Monday, but a key factor that is likely to be considered is the rate of increase in the number of cases in a given area, which reflects the spread of the disease. Allowing a return to normal commerce before the virus abates risks a re-emergence, negating any gains from social isolation and other mitigation efforts.</p>
<p>Discussions will begin immediately, but no timeline was given for when recommendations would be made. California, Oregon and Washington state are forming a similar organization.</p>
<p>Decisions about reopening business must be made thoughtfully, Mr. Wolf said.</p>
<p>“We need to do this right,” he said, “and restore the hope that this pandemic has taken from us.”</p>
<p>The new coronavirus, which causes a highly contagious respiratory infection, has effectively shut down as much as one-third of the U.S. economy, according to economists at the University of California, Berkeley. Reopening the economy is like to cost trillions of dollars on top of what has been approved for relief efforts.</p>
<p>Jesse Rothstein, director of Berkeley’s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, compared the economic impact of COVID-19 to the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, Gov. Wolf’s ordered shutdown of businesses March 19 has resulted in the filing of 1.3 million claims for unemployment compensation in the past month, state Department of Labor and Industry Secretary Gerard Oleksiak said Monday in a call with reporters.</p>
<p>The claims have overwhelmed the office, which has been fielding 12,000 to 14,000 calls a day, mostly due to glitches in the system.</p>
<p>“It’s simply a problem of volume,” Mr. Oleksiak said. “We’re doing all we can.”</p>
<p>Formation of the council comes as the number of new cases in New York, a COVID-19 hot spot, seem to have plateaued, Mr. Cuomo said.</p>
<p>“It’s not going down, but it’s not going up at the same rate,” Mr. Cuomo said about his state. “That’s relatively good news in a world of bad options.”&nbsp;COVID-19 cases in New York exceeded 10,000 Sunday, with 671 deaths.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, social distancing, business and school closures and other mitigation efforts have lessened the potential impact of the new coronavirus, according to a survey by the University of Washington, which has constructed a computer model for the anticipated spread of the disease in each state.</p>
<p>Nineteen new cases were reported in Allegheny County Monday, bringing the new total to 876, with 21 deaths.&nbsp;Statewide, cases totaled 24,199 with 524 deaths.</p>
<p>New Jersey has been another outbreak hot spot and Gov. Phil Murphy called the battle against COVID-19 the&nbsp;“fight of our lives.”</p>
<p>“Reopening ourselves back up will be equally challenging,” he said.</p>
