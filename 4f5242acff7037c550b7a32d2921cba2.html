<h1>Brian O'Neill: One last dispatch from the Paris of Appalachia</h1>

<p>OK, I guess that’s enough.</p>
<p>I started in Pittsburgh newspapers half my life ago, in the last days of the Reagan administration and the early days of Mayor Sophie Masloff’s reign on Grant Street, and I’m retiring today. This will be my last regular column. I don’t know of anyone who had the privilege of writing a news-side column longer for the people of this quirky town that plays a big city on TV.</p>
<p>Consider this a thank-you note for a get-together that lasted almost 32 years. Warm your coffee if you like, but I won’t keep you much longer.</p>
<p>My philosophy from the start was to concentrate on the stories of Pittsburgh,&nbsp;and by that I never meant only the centerpiece city, with boundaries drawn for an economy that disappeared generations ago. I mean the real Pittsburgh that stretches in four directions and clear out of Allegheny County, as surely as traffic slows in the Squirrel Hill Tunnel.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to be a storyteller, not a preacher, and I’ve been blessed to live in our Third Bear of places: not too big, not too small, not too hard, not too soft. I’m a native New Yorker who spent most of the 1980s in the mountains of southwest Virginia, and I’ve long considered myself blessed to have found a home in this place pretty much smack dab in the middle, culturally and geographically, this <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/6868002" target="_blank">Paris of Appalachia.</a></p>
<p>It’s not hard writing three columns a week, but three good ones a week? That’s hard. On my better days, I’ve been able to find the Pittsburghers whose small stories told us more about the big picture. There must be about 4,500 columns in all, give or take. I like to think readers bailed early on the ones that didn’t work.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve said pretty much all I need to say, except this: I’m so grateful to every reader, the ones who called or emailed, and the ones who didn’t. The ones who said nice things and the ones who hit the phone yelling. A good newspaper column should never be the last word. It should start conversations.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since my first day at The Pittsburgh Press, Halloween 1988. Back then, the Sunday paper could be as thick as a phone book (for those who remember phone books). Time passed, the internet took hold and American newspapers individually decided it would be a great idea if we just gave away all our information free.&nbsp;That didn’t turn out well for any of us, though it’s worked out great for the social-media companies that cannibalize our work. I’m leaving now in part because your PG is trying to figure out a way to survive.</p>
<p>I turn 65 in March, so the timing of the buyout offer is good for me. As buyouts go, it’s not as good as Bobby Bonilla’s annual <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/new-york/mets/post/_/id/125162/happy-bobby-bonilla-day-his-annual-1-19-million-payday-is-here" target="_blank">million-dollar payday</a>&nbsp;from the New York Mets, but it beats a round of drinks. I’m genuinely looking forward to waking up and not having to feel strongly about anything.</p>
<p>I don’t want this to sound anything like diving on a live grenade, but I also don’t need the paycheck anymore. I arrived in Pittsburgh single and am now the father of two beautiful daughters who are not all that much younger than some very good reporters, photographers and editors around here. My colleagues won the Pulitzer Prize last year and more Keystone Awards than any newspaper in Pennsylvania this year, and I’m going to keep subscribing to see what else they can do. I’d rather take a buyout than see any of them laid off.</p>
<p>They’re better suited for the future anyway. I understand social media about as well as my dog understood a 1040 form. Ginning up clicks by posting columns on Facebook and Twitter is a task I won’t miss.</p>
<p>(Twitter.com, in particular, bunches my shorts. It offers less room per tweet than this paragraph, so sanctimony is rampant and nuance is a foreign object. Post a story in that can of Pringles and it’s unlikely to be read unless it’s providing fresh ammo for the ongoing culture wars.)</p>
<p>I’m extraordinarily lucky to have been born at a time when I could work in newspapers for 42 years. As impressed as I am by the work that my colleagues still manage to do under increasingly difficult, often thankless circumstances, I wonder what’s not going to be covered when we have a smaller staff.</p>
<p>I’ll happily subscribe to find out because as I think I’ve mentioned before, as bad as the government can be with us watching, wait’ll you see what it’s like when we stop.</p>
<p>So this is it, boys and girls. Old man that I am, I’m reminded of an episode of “The Twilight Zone,” the one with Burgess Meredith surrounded by books after a nuclear holocaust, happy because he has&nbsp;<a href="https://twilightzone.fandom.com/wiki/Time_Enough_at_Last" target="_blank">“Time Enough At Last”</a>&nbsp;to spend the rest of his life reading. I’m counting on a better ending.</p>
<p>With no excuse left not to finish “Ulysses,” I will. Then maybe I’ll try writing the obligatory autobiographical first novel, the one that doesn’t get published but your friends love and half your family hates.</p>
<p>But my day will begin each morning with a cup of coffee and a PG. I hope yours will, too. I know there are a lot of great stories around here still untold. I’m thankful you allowed me more than three decades to tell more than my share.</p>
