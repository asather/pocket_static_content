<h1>State says one new death in Western Pa. — in Allegheny County </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County’s health department reported no new deaths on Sunday, but the state health department later reported that the county had one additional death, the only fatality in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Allegheny County reported that it had 150 deaths, with no change from Saturday. When the state released its data an hour later, however, it credited the county with 159 deaths, one more than it did Saturday. Of the county’s reported&nbsp;deaths, it says 139 are confirmed and 11 are probable.</p>
<p>Since the first case was reported March 14, the county now has 1,777 cases, which is 24 more than Saturday.&nbsp;A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to the county.</p>
<p>Additionally, there have been 318 past or present hospitalizations related to COVID-19. Of those, at least 121 have required admission to the intensive care unit and 67 needed mechanical ventilation. The county has given at least 27,796 tests, with a capacity to do around 2,000 a day.</p>

<p>The state Department of Health on Sunday said it had 730 new cases of COVID-19, pushing its total to 67,713. It is the 14th straight day with fewer than 1,000 cases. The department also reported 28 new deaths, giving it a total of 5,124.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The continuing reduction in the number of new cases spurred Gov. Tom Wolf to reduce restrictions Friday for 16 counties mostly in the northern tier of the state, moving them from the yellow category to green and planning to move all counties out of the most strict red category by June 5. Counties in the yellow category can have some businesses open on a limited basis and those in green can have restaurants open at half their normal capacity and businesses such as salons can see customers by appointment.</p>
