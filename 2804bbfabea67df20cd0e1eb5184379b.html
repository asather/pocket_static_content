<h1>Fishing Report: A whopper  — big, old and endangered  — caught in Lake Erie</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A giant endangered fish was caught last week on Lake Erie’s Presque Isle Bay. Nick Lohrer of Fairview, Erie County, boated a bigmouth buffalo measuring 40 inches with 28-inch girth. He guessed its weight at about 40 pounds. It was released where it was taken in Misery Bay.</p>
<p>Although it looks like a carp and is named like a bass, Ictiobus cyprinellus is the largest member of the sucker family. It is a filter feeder, straining tiny crustacean zooplankton from the bottom of the water column. Native to the Mississippi River system, it was stocked in the Great Lakes in a failed attempt to start a commercial fishery 100 years ago.</p>
<p>The bigmouth buffalo is the longest living of all freshwater fishes. Examination of the ear bone, or otolith, showed one specimen had lived for 112 years. Since the fish is endangered in Pennsylvania, it must be released if caught. A Fish and Boat Commission spokesman said there is no state record, but a 49½-inch, 76.8-pounder was caught in Wisconsin in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County) Early in the week, high muddy water ended a steelhead hot streak. Smaller creeks were draining Thursday, but snow and northwest winds nearing 20 mph were expected Friday with partly cloudy skies over the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Pymatuning Reservoir</strong> (Crawford County) Few anglers were on the water. A few perch and panfish were caught from shore.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River (</strong>Warren County) Big muskies were released near Buckaloons Recreation Area and the mouth of Brokenstraw Creek. Smallmouth bass went for grubs off Betts Park and near the Tidioute boat launch.</p>
<p><strong>Buffalo Creek</strong> (Butler County) The Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only stretch, part of the Keystone Select trophy trout stocking program, was expected to get browns and rainbows Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Neshannock Creek</strong> (Lawrence County) The state is looking for kids to help with stocking in the Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only area from the dam at Volant to the covered bridge. On Saturday, a scheduled stocking is to include trophy-size Keystone Select browns, rainbows and golden rainbows. The tanker trucks start unloading at Neshannock Creek Fly Shop at about noon to coincide with the annual Volunteer Firemen’s Pancake Breakfast at the fire hall from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The fly shop, which is under new management, has planned a family-friendly independent lunker trout stocking at 1 p.m. March 14.</p>
<p><strong>Loyalhanna Creek</strong> (Westmoreland County) On Monday, trophy-size brown, rainbow and golden rainbow trout were stocked in the Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only area, 1.67 miles from Route 711 downstream to Two Mile Run Road.</p>
<p><strong>Indian Creek</strong> (Westmoreland County) Browns and rainbows were expected to be delivered to the Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only stretch from the Hunters Road bridge to the Route 381 bridge in Jones Mills on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>Meadow Run</strong> (Fayette County) Two- to 3-year-old Keystone Select breeders — browns, rainbows and golden rainbows retired from state trout hatcheries when they reached 14-20 inches — were added to a regular state stocking in the Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only area on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Dutch Fork</strong> (Washington County) Brown and rainbow trout were delivered Wednesday to the Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only area, from the I-70 bridge near Gas Road to the Hicks Road Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>Pike Run (</strong>Washington County) The Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only stretch, from a point off Ridge Road to a power line crossing off Pike Run Road, got a state stocking of brown and rainbow trout Thursday.</p>
