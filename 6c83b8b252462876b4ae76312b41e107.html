<h1>Pa. counties tell governor they are going rogue, easing coronavirus restrictions without permission</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Six Schuylkill County elected officials, including all three county commissioners, informed Gov. Tom Wolf in a letter Saturday that next Friday, the county will ease restrictions put into place to curb the spread of the coronavirus, in defiance of the governor’s order to remain closed.</p>
<p>In doing so, Schuylkill joined Lebanon and Dauphin counties in declaring an end to the shutdown without waiting for permission.</p>
<p>“We have heard the pleas of our residents who desire the ability to safely re-open their businesses and safely return to work,” the letter from the Schuylkill officials said.</p>
<p>A letter to Wolf on Thursday by 18 members of Schuylkill County’s Response, Recovery and Renewal team, for the county to move to the yellow phase of the state’s three-phase approach to reopening, pointing Schuylkill’s low population density and relatively few coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>According to the state Health Department, 437 people in Schuylkill County have tested positive for the coronavirus and 13 have died.</p>
<p>Wolf has allowed 24 counties to move from red to yellow, with another 13 counties in Western Pennsylvania set to join that group next Friday.</p>
<p>“This letter serves to inform you of our intention to move from the Red Phase to the Yellow Phase of your COVID- 19 Phased Reopening Plan, effective May 15,2020,” the letter from the six Schuylkill County officials read. “Schuylkill County has met the requirement of your original Stay-at-Home Order, which was to flatten the curve of the COVID-19 outbreak and allow hospitals the time to gear up for COVID-19 patients being admitted to the ICU and in need of ventilators.”</p>
<p>The letter said the county’s residents have heeded the instructions and local health care facilities have the ability to effectively treat coronavirus patients. It added that businesses will be required to follow guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on hand-washing, social distancing and mask wearing, the letter noted.</p>
<p>It is signed by state Sen. David G. Argall, state Reps. Jerry Knowles and Mike Tobash, and county commissioners George Halcovage Jr., Gary Hess and Barron Hetherington. All but Hess are Republicans.</p>
<p>All six also signed the letter from the county’s response, recovery and renewal team, as did two hospital officials: Wendy Lazo, vice president for operations at St. Luke’s University Health Network, and Gabe Kamarousky, president of Geisinger-St. Luke’s Hospital.</p>
