<h1>U.S. attorney asks citizens to report housing discrimination during pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office is asking anyone who has witnessed or experienced sexual harassment by a landlord or anyone with control over housing because of the virus crisis to report it to federal authorities.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said the pandemic has affected the ability of many people to pay their rent on time.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is investigating reports of landlords and property managers exploiting the crisis by demanding sex in lieu of rent and other sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment in housing is illegal and Mr. Brady said his office will pursue it.</p>
<p>“While many landlords are responding to these circumstances with understanding and care,</p>
<p>trying to work with their tenants to weather the current crisis, others are responding to requests to</p>
<p>defer rent payments with demands for sexual favors and other acts of unwelcome sexual</p>
<p>misconduct,” he said in a statement, describing such conduct as "despicable."</p>
<p>The DOJ launched a sexual harassment in housing initiative in 2017. It's led by the civil rights division in conjunction with U.S. attorney's offices around the nation. The goal is to address sexual harassment by landlords, managers, maintenance workers or loan officers.</p>
<p>DOJ enforces the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, family status, national origin and disabilities.</p>
<p>Mr. Brady said many people don't know that sexual harassment by a housing provider is a violation of federal law.</p>
<p>Anyone who has experienced it is asked to contact the U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh at 412-644-3500 or send an email to usapaw.civilrights@usdoj.gov.</p>
