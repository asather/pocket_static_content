<h1>Sweat Equity: An author and bookseller's one-woman quest to raise up the work of John Edgar Wideman</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Karen Lillis came to Pittsburgh with her partner in 2005 after being squeezed out of New York’s pricey apartment rental market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He wanted to move somewhere very affordable, which meant veering off the East Coast,” Ms. Lillis said. “We both wanted to move somewhere that had a strong arts and cultural scene, so we ended up in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>A lifelong lover of books and the adjacent worlds, Ms. Lillis, of North Oakland, also came to the city that has been her home for the last 15 years to attend the University of Pittsburgh’s acclaimed graduate program for library sciences, from which she graduated in 2009.</p>
<p>Even as a grad student, she was making her mark on the local book and literary scene with a modest entrepreneurial venture called Lillis Distribution Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“The idea was to try to cross-pollinate small press literature from one city to another, because it seemed like regional scenes were so insular,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Lillis debuted a pop-up bookstand in summer 2013 called Small Press Pittsburgh that showcased new, local books&nbsp;“with a smattering of small press literature from other cities,” she said. It was a low-key, but consistent presence on what had finally become a burgeoning literary scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I popped up at Polish Hill Arts Fest, Unblurred, and lit events here and there,” she said.&nbsp;“Within months, I started the online component of the bookstand — at first, so I could feature Small Press Roulette, a surprise package of recommended small press reads. Then in December 2013, I launched the first annual Holiday Book Sale (the first one was held at Belvedere) showcasing Pittsburgh’s indie book vendors.”</p>
<p>In September 2016, Ms. Lillis relaunched her online bookstore as Karen’s Book Row with an emphasis on&nbsp;“vintage books that I find to have relevance to today’s conversations,” she said.&nbsp;“The shop forefronts feminist fiction, LGBT lit, African American authors and counterculture reads.”</p>
<p>She became manager of Caliban Book Shop in Oakland in 2019, adding to an already busy workload.</p>
<p>Ms. Lillis will soon be embarking on an online venture she is calling #WidemanChallenge to boost a wider appreciation of the novels and essays of Pittsburgh native John Edgar Wideman.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I often recommend Wideman novels as a bookseller,” she said.&nbsp;“I got tired of running into people of all stripes — Pittsburghers, people outside the city, writers, readers — who had never heard of him.</p>
<p>“It started to seem more and more unbelievable to me. His work is utterly relevant to this moment, this national conversation we’re having about race and inequality and the prison industrial complex. And Pittsburgh loves to tout their own,” she said, adding that “there is such a wide gap between how many should know his work versus how many do.”</p>
<p>Ms. Lillis wants to find at least one reviewer for each Wideman book and publish them online in the fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Hashtags and social media posts will spread the reviews around and challenge others to read his books,” she said.&nbsp;“I’d like to talk to some editors about assigning review essays and challenge other editors to assign something Wideman-related of their own choosing.’</p>
<p>She love for the #WidemanChallenge to reach readers and writers and GoodReads reviewers and “just shower a lot of concerted attention on a novelist and memoirist who has been considering the effects of poverty, slavery and incarceration on Black America since 1967.”</p>
<p>Ironically, given her interest in the author, the closest Ms. Lillis has ever come to speaking to John Edgar Wideman was at a book signing for his novel&nbsp;“Fanon” in 2008 or 2009.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The whole time that Black Lives Matter has been a catch phrase running through our heads, I’ve been asking myself,&nbsp;‘Why haven’t John Edgar Wideman’s books made a comeback yet?’ ” she wonders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She’s been thinking about that since around 2014, sort of assuming a Wideman resurgence would happen on its own.</p>
<p>“For some reason, hearing the phrase Black Lives Matter makes me think pretty quickly of John Edgar Wideman, especially&nbsp;‘The Homewood Trilogy’,” Ms. Lillis said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said it’s the bookseller/librarian in her — not the fangirl — that is pushing ahead with this book review project. She wants to see his books on today’s reading lists.</p>
<p>“I haven’t read all of his books, but I know from what I’ve read that [he] is a gorgeous prose stylist, a deeply thoughtful observer of Black life, class structure and systemic racism in America ... a playful experimenter, and an examiner of the painful, personal effects of the criminal justice system.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is encouraged that John Wideman’s publisher is re-releasing&nbsp;“Philadelphia Fire” and&nbsp;“Brothers &amp; Keepers” this fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Maybe this is exactly the beginning of the Wideman resurgence that I was hoping for,” Ms. Lillis said.&nbsp;“Certainly these books should appeal to a broader new audience. At least two young generations in our midst have been invigorated by passionate activism and leftist history and should find something to relate to in&nbsp;‘Philadelphia Fire.’ ”&nbsp;</p>
<p>She believes&nbsp;“Brothers &amp; Keepers” in particular should be on all Black Lives Matter reading lists because it&nbsp;“is a painful, personal, revealing look at the family ripples of incarceration.”</p>
<p>The author of four novellas, Ms. Lillis is working on her latest, but she doesn’t feel her own style has been particularly influenced by Wideman.</p>
<p>“I’d already been writing prose for 15 years when I discovered [him],” she said.&nbsp;“If anything of Wideman impressed itself on the writer in me, it is a sense of the rigor that it takes to make something soar off the page as a piece of writing,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A lot of the writers who influenced me early on were the kind who make prose seem effortless [and] who manage to exude a nonchalance,” she added.&nbsp;“You only find out when you’re trying to imitate it how effortless it’s not.”</p>
