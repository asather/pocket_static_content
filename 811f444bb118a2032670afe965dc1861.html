<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 05.11.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Howdy, folks. Let’s begin the chat. The chat has begun. I have thoughts on the Steelers, of course, but also plenty on The Last Dance. Maybe you aren’t watching, but hey, it’s basically what passes for “sports” right now.</p>
<p><strong>TX Steeler</strong>: Odds three teams from AFC North make playoffs? Of course we are assuming a monumental shift in Cleveland culture, but on paper, and with the additional spot this year, it seems like 50/50 is at least a conservative guess, right? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Actually not bad, in my estimation. In fact, I’m calling it now that the AFC North is going to be the best division in the conference and maybe the whole league. I don’t know Kevin Stefanski from Kevin Stevens, but the Browns roster looks good. The Steelers roster looks good. The Ravens are almost a lock to be good. We’re on the same page, my Texas friend.</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: are you one of those beat writers that kiss ben’s azz? or do you think ben is vastly over rated, no playoffs the last 2 years, no playoff win in 4 years, and the lowest qb rating of all time for a winning qb of 22.8 in a super bowl !!! he’s only in this for the money, worst contract of all time for a steeler, he’ll never be a team guy, never was, its all about him!!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ah crap, I didn’t realize I have to be on one of those two islands. Gonna need to take the rest of the day to think about this one because it’s a big choice.</p>
<p><strong>Carltto Brigante</strong>: Hey Brian, give us the inside scoop, Steelers victories 9 1/2, Over or Under? Got my guy on speedial. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I’m thinking under as of now, but I wouldn’t take it to Vegas. Here’s the real scoop: I don’t know how many games they’re going to win.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Seems teams with returning HCs and coordinators might have an advantage this season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That’s a logical assumption, but I still tend to think the teams with the best collection of talent will have the advantage. Just hoping we actually get to find out.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Morning Brian. Still many people in quarantine and not much else to do. Any suggestions besides rewatching old games?? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: From a strictly football perspective? You could watch college games of the draft picks. Or start boning up on the 2021 prospects. Or listen to the Post-Gazette’s North Shore Drive podcast with me and Ray Fittipaldo, but I hope you already do that: <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="_blank">https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-...</a></p>
<p><strong>Richard</strong>: Scientists predict the virus will rise again in the fall. So I’m thinking the most relevant question about the NFL is not about who will play what position, but instead what will the NFL do when players have had close contact with teammates and opponents and then test positive? The rules for the general public would dictate everyone who had had contact should be quarantined for two weeks. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Certainly, Richard, that is the biggest question right now. That’s essentially reason No. 1 why the other leagues shut down when they did. I imagine highly paid people within the NFL are trying to hatch plans for this type of scenario as we speak. Wish I had an answer for you, but I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: I’m a Tomlin supporter, but I know there are those out there that are not. Under what circumstances do you think MT’s job would be in jeopardy? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Tough to say, but if I were to guess, it’d take a pretty miserable performance for his seat to seriously heat up. Remember, he has one more year left on his deal after 2020, as of now. That gives some flexibility in terms of not needing to do anything with his contract this offseason, but hey, he did some of his best work last season in my opinion. I’d think they’d have to not only miss the playoffs this year but be very far from the postseason picture for him to be in question.</p>
<p><strong>The 4th Watt brother!</strong>: Awesome article on the Watt family! It was very cool to hear how they are all back in Wisconsin together training. Do you think Derek will take his game to a higher level this year being on the same team with his brother? It definitely seems as though these guys push each other immensely! And by higher level I mean better offensive play than he had a chance to show in SD.... <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thanks, I definitely enjoyed talking with their parents and writing the piece. I’m an only child, so I can only imagine the sibling dynamics, but I do think there’s something to Derek Watt deriving some motivation from not wanting to just be “T.J.’s brother” in Pittsburgh. Then again, I think he’s had that driving him really his whole NFL career to this point. It’ll just be a different situation for him here in this locker room.</p>
<p><strong>Andy Russell 4HOF</strong>: Hi Brian...your thoughts on the Friday night Bradshaw interview with KDKA ‘s Bob P. and Rich W. if you saw it? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Did not see it, but my grandma told me it was pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>Indy</strong>: I know people wanted us to take Hurts, but do you think this team would be any better in 2020 with him? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Jalen Hurts might improve this team, but not as much as Chase Claypool. That’s how I see it.</p>
<p><strong>Steelknight</strong>: I’m curious as to how strong Davis is. To be an effective NT in our 34 you need to be short (6’1-6’2), big (320+), mobile and very strong ala Big Snack. Davis sounds like he has everything but strength. Thoughts? Thanks. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Carlos Davis’ weakness isn’t strength, it’s length. He put up 21 reps on the bench press, which ranked 11th among D-linemen at the combine. But he had some of the shortest arms there for guys at his position. That’s probably one of the main reasons he was considered a fringe prospect.</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: I noticed that the nfl released a schedule for exhibition games ...about when is the play or no play deadline for the HOF Steelers/Cowboys game ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not sure about that, but it doesn’t seem as if the NFL is in any rush to decide on much.</p>
<p><strong>Indy</strong>: From everything I read Derek was the most athletic of the Watt brothers, do you think we got a deal in signing him? He could turn out to be a fantastic FB if used right!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well, he was the most athletic in high school, to a degree. Or at least the most accomplished. I do think he has more upside than Roosevelt Nix, given his size, strength and pass-catching ability.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: By mid-season, which 3 WR’s get the most playing time: Juju, Johnson and ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think James Washington will still be seeing the third-most snaps at that point, but I’ll say that Chase Claypool is making more of an impact in his playing time by then. Just a thought.</p>
<p><strong>Celtics fan</strong>: Hey Brian...in regards to the Last Dance series, I don’t think Pippen looks good at all. Could you imagine Franco telling Coach Noll he wasn’t going into a playoff game for the last play? In that scenario, Franco would have started his career with Seattle a lot sooner! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I had no idea about that incident. But my favorite part of last night was MJ not even having Steve Kerr’s phone number when he wanted to call and apologize.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>: Hearing rumors Pat McAfee is planning a possible comeback. Any chance he returns home and sends the long over due Jordan Berry packing? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That’d be the most intriguing punter story line we could hope for in 2020. Second most would be Steelers legacy Dustin Colquitt coming in. Third would be left footed Belgium born 2019 practice punter Corliss Waitman winning the gig as a UDFA. You know what, maybe that’s No. 1.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I understand that Ben Roethlisberger has made some missteps in the past, but why is it that the entire sports world has collectively dumped on him over the past 18 months or so? From blindly accepting the narrative of 2 malcontents in AB &amp; Leveon to Jay Glazer most recently, it’s seemingly in vogue to put the guy down who seems to be a fine teammate and a good husband and father. Can you elaborate on that at all? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Elaborate on that? That’s a pretty high bar to clear for elaboration, Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>ZO</strong>: Which of the Steelers 2020 Draft Class do you see as being the biggest contributor as a rookie despite the COVID-19 hardships in play such as virtual rookie camp? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Chaypool</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: Do you think it’s too early to predict how the Steelers will do until we see Ben play? A number of people think the Steelers will win at least 10 games. I think it’s premature to make such a prediction. Thanks Brian. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Pretty much, yeah, but our industry is all about predictions anymore, especially premature ones.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Good morning Brian. Do you think the Steelers had and continue to have in mind, playing JuJu in the slot with the drafting of Claypool? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yes, both JuJu and Diontae Johnson, whom I think is a bit miscast as an outside guy at this level.</p>
<p><strong>TX Steeler</strong>: Who gets drafted/signed first, Ben’s replacement or Pouncey’s? No knock on MP, but I’d prefer to already have a fresh stud established up front when/if a rookie QB takes over. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Depends if you believe Ben’s replacement is already on the roster in Mason Rudolph.</p>
<p><strong>AA</strong>: I was hoping the Steelers would draft someone who would replace McCullers this season. Looks like that won’t happen. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Carlos Davis could, even though he’s not the same type of NT. If you look at Mike Tomlin’s comments from the weekend, that might be a good thing <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/10/anthony-mcfarland-devin-bush-leveon-bell-carlos-davis-antoine-brooks-steelers/stories/202005100100" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/10/anthony-mcfarl...</a></p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Brian, would Miami’s plan work at Heinz Field, where attendance would be limited to about one quarter capacity? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Perhaps if each quarter of fans got to watch one quarter of the game in the stadium. Before and after, you walk down the street to [whatever local establishment wants to sponsor this chat].</p>
<p><strong>Steelknight</strong>: How do teams deal with situations where players don’t have proper equipment athome to train during social distancing? Thanks. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Probably just tell those players they still have no excuse not to be in shape for the 2020 season, if it happens.</p>
<p><strong>Florida Steeler</strong>: Right now it looks like the Ravens are better than the Steelers. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think I agree!</p>
<p><strong>WV Black &amp; Gold</strong>: Paul Lochrane keeps spewing his same venom about Ben in every PG sports chat. Can you guys please get together and take a vote on not showing his questions going forward? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well, as an objective outlet, we don’t work for the Steelers or get paid to promote them, so we can’t just publish all the positive comments and questions.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: One of your fellow staff members has said that he believes that anyone who is drafted and doesn’t make the team is a bust. That includes 6th and 7th rounders. Most 6th and 7th round picks are cut, so I think it is unfair to label them as busts. Your opinion? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not sure it really matters. On one hand, no, you can’t expect a ton of contributors from the back end of the draft. But then again, some of those guys do pan out, so those that don’t aren’t as good as others. Does that make you a bust? I don’t know. What I do know is I love when this chat gets deeply philosophical.</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Hi Brian. For this being rated the second-easiest schedule in the NFL, it sure doesn’t seem that way. For example, at Jacksonville, who always plays the Steelers tough, then home to face the Ravens four days later on Thanksgiving Day. Then, three of the final four on the road. I’m guessing 9-7 (if the season goes off on schedule). <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I’m with you. I think the schedule this year is just as tough as last year, if not tougher. If there were ever a year when you’d WANT to face the Patriots, this is it, in my opinion. The Jaguars probably won’t be good, but the AFC South might be sneaky competitive. A lot will depend on if the Browns have their stuff together.</p>
<p><strong>Old School</strong>: In your opinion, do the Steelers have a true #1 wide receiver on the team? If yes, whom? Thank you. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yes, I still think JuJu can be that guy. And will be that guy in 2020, if I had to bet on it. Plus I like Claypool’s potential/ceiling, but the jury is out, quite obviously.</p>
<p><strong>DaquidoBazzini</strong>: Brian - I got a kick out of you predicting the Steelers would go 7-9 this season. While possible, I don’t know if it’s probable if Ben Roethlisberger returns. Here’s another question...What percent chance do you think this season will be played? I’ll place it at 20%. When the chips are down, it’s going to be too hard to deal with the problems it presents. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That’s what I’m here for, to give you all kicks. Look, it’ll be a long four (or more) months for me if I’m by far the least bullish on the Steelers locally, but it’s hard to argue there’s not a wide range of outcomes for them in 2020. And also a wide range of outcomes for the league itself. It’s OK to not know.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: If I lived in Cleveland and Baltimore I would be saying “ Oh no we have to play the Steelers twice” but no you picked the Steelers to be 0&gt;4<br> get real! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Long four (or more) months for me.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Thanks for the chats B squared. I am not downplaying the season that Lamar Jackson had but how long can he sustain this level of play? I predict a sophomore slump (or maybe its just wishful thinking). What say you <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Technically, last season was his sophomore year, and he did not slump. So says I.</p>
<p><strong>WV Black &amp; Gold</strong>: I don’t mind that it’s negative, just that it’s the same question/statement in every single chat. I love the PG sports team, so I read every chat. His rhetoric is tiring. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Fair enough. We’re happy to have you all on board, for the chats and everything else we do, whether you’re a naysayer or a hater or a Kool-Aider.</p>
<p><strong>Willie</strong>: HiBrian, Any chance that Ben has a good/pretty good year, decides he wants another year or two, and gets his contract extended, or is it two years and done regardless ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: There’s always a chance, Willie. It’s just that reading the tea leaves from his comments over the past few years, most assume it’s two-and-done. And you can count me in the camp that if he were to win a Super Bowl this year, he’d be content to go out on top.</p>
<p><strong>VmR 3</strong>: There was a story a while back that Kevin Colbert wanted to retire but that ARII talked him into staying to more years. And that his two year extension essentially coincides with Ben’s end date extension. Is that true? Does it line up? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Kevin Colbert is on a year to year basis now with the Steelers, which is why I think any season could be his last. Even he’d probably tell you that. But I do think two straight years missing the playoffs and going 8-8 last season leaves a sour taste in his mouth as a competitor and a guy who’s been excellent at this for a long time. I also don’t think he’ll be a GM anywhere other than here.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: Philosophical chats: who would be a bigger Steelers fan: Plato or Socrates😂? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: What about The Big Aristotle? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: And with that, we’re done for the day. See you all next week, if you’re so inclined.</p>
