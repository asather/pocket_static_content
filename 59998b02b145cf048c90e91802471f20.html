<h1>Paul Zeise: NFL combine is the perfect example of why owners don't need to cave</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>God bless Mike and Maurkice Pouncey as they try to convince all of the middle and minimum salary players to vote down the latest collective bargaining agreement proposal. I admire they are saying with a straight face that they want to put together a fund for higher-end players to pay into that will help the lower-end players through a strike if necessary.</p>
<p>It is admirable but it is a waste of time energy and money. The Players Association might vote this CBA proposal down but eventually they will sign one that still favors the owners. The NFL always wins, and as a result, the players will eventually always lose.</p>
<p>I look no further than the NFL combine as Exhibit A as to the strength and health of the NFL. They have convinced us all that somehow it is must-see TV to watch a bunch of guys in shorts run through exercises. And so many of us have bought into it that they are now showing the combine in prime time.</p>
<p>And the ratings for the combine suggest that even though most of us think it is silly, a whole lot of us still tune in to watch it. And that is precisely why the NFL is the king of the sports world. No other league has figured out a way quite so brilliantly to make us all pay attention and care so much all year long.</p>
<p>That’s why the owners, led by Roger Goodell, are confident they can and will win this labor fight with the players. The league is strong and everyone is getting extraordinarily rich and there doesn’t seem to be any sign of it slowing down any time soon.</p>
<p>People love the NFL. They love the brand and they love their favorite teams. Yes, the players are the product and, yes, the league wouldn’t be the same with replacement players, but the players still need the NFL far more than the NFL needs the players. A strike would be a really dumb decision by the players because they would only prove how replaceable they are.</p>
<p>The players have threatened at times to form their own league if they don’t get their demands met. That has always been a pipe dream and always will be because even if they did that, they wouldn’t be able to come close to raising the kind of money and revenue the NFL does and they’d end up with a whole lot less than they have now.</p>
<p>Owners are billionaires and most of them don’t need their NFL team to make money, as they have a lot of other business interests. That’s why they can sit out as long as they need to before players start to need their paychecks again.</p>
<p>People wouldn’t necessarily want to pay to watch replacement players but some — actually a lot — of people would. People want to see their favorite teams. They watch preseason games for this reason and they would still tune in to watch. The replacement players would only be a temporary fix, but they would only be needed temporarily. My guess is it would be about two weeks of replacement games before the rank-and-file players would start to break cross the picket lines to go back to work.</p>
<p>I understand why the richest players don’t like the deal, as nobody — fans included — seems to want a 17th game. There is already a lot of wear and tear on these players’ bodies. The 15th and 16th games usually tend to get a little bit ragged because players are beat up from the long season. A 17th game would just add one more layer of wear and tear and provide one more opportunity for key players to get hurt.</p>
<p>It all makes sense, but this deal will ensure the financial stability of the league and make a lot of players rich (as the minimum wage and salary cap will both be increased). I am all for the players making their money and once this deal is signed, they all will still make far more money than they could doing just about anything else.</p>
<p>My guess is, despite the hooting and hollering of a few highly paid players, the deal will pass and everyone will eventually settle in and accept. The players will still make their money and the NFL will make its money. And of course all of us suckers will still tune in to watch combine workouts, drafts and every other thing the NFL’s marketing people can trick us into thinking is important enough to watch.&nbsp;</p>
