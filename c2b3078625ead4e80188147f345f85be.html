<p>City police are asking for help in identifying a suspect in an Uptown assault that occurred during a May 30 protest prompted by the death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>The male is&nbsp;suspected of assaulting a male on Washington Place near Fifth Avenue, and also is&nbsp;suspected of vandalizing a police vehicle in that same location, according to the city <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PittsburghPolice/" target="_blank">Bureau of Police Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>It says that the Damage Assessment and Accountability Taskforce, comprising local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, has been analyzing video, photos, and information “to identify individuals who committed criminal acts during the primarily peaceful demonstrations in the city” that occurred in reaction to the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Anyone with information is asked to contact the Taskforce at DAAT@Pittsburghpa.gov, or call (412) 323-7800 and ask for the Taskforce. Contributors will remain anonymous.</p>
