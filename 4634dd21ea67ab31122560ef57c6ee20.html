<p>The tattoo session at a Stowe residence ended when Jeremy Carson shot the artist, detectives said.</p>
<p>Carson, 24, of Knoxville, and 28-year old Paloma Fields, of McKeesport, now face multiple charges including attempted homicide, aggravated assault and robbery after Carson shot&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/07/10/Stowe-shooting-two-men-hurt-injured-police/stories/202007100142" target="_blank">shot two men Friday</a>&nbsp;afternoon, according to a criminal complaint. Both suspects were arrested Saturday.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Ms. Fields and Carson were picked up by a jitney driver Friday morning at the East Exit motel on Route 22 in Monroeville. Hotel management said the two had been renting a room on an “almost daily basis,” the complaint reads, though it does not say for how long.</p>
<p>The driver took them the 1200 block of Stowe Avenue, and went into the second floor living room to receive tattoos from someone who lived there.</p>
<p>During the jitney driver’s tattoo session, an argument broke out between Carson, the tattoo artist and “possibly another resident of the house,” detective Daniel Meyer wrote in the complaint.</p>
<p>Carson pulled out a handgun and pointed it at the tattoo artist, the complaint reads. “Give me the money,” a witness recalled Carson saying. “Give me everything.”</p>
<p>Detectives said Carson fired three or four shots, hitting the tattoo artist in the leg. A victim in the downstairs kitchen also was struck by the gunfire.</p>
<p>The jitney driver, identified in the complaint only as Witness #2, ran out of the house and back to the car. Ms. Fields was waiting in the driver’s seat and already had the vehicle running when Witness #2 got into the passenger seat.</p>
<p>Detectives said Carson, after taking the artist’s iPhone and cash, got into the backseat and the car left. Carson and Ms. Fields returned to the East Exit motel, and Witness #2 drove back to Pittsburgh. Surveillance footage showed another man driving behind them in a silver Subaru, who also entered the motel room and remained there overnight, the complaint reads.</p>
<p>When police arrived at the Stowe Avenue house, they found the male victims suffering gunshot wounds. Both men were transported to Allegheny General Hospital in stable condition.</p>
<p>Investigators found two .45-caliber casings in the living room, as well as blood stains on the floor, the couch and a pair of jean shorts.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for July 28 at 10 a.m. Court records Saturday evening did not list lawyers for Carson or Ms. Fields, and Carson’s family could not be reached. Ms. Fields’ brother declined to comment.</p>
