<h1>Bethel Park bird lover is volunteer of the year at  National Aviary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With their bright blue feathers and yellow-rimmed eyes, Benito and Sapphira stand out amid the greenery of the Tropical Rainforest at the National Aviary. The hyacinth macaws perch near the waterfall and like it when people stop and talk to them, 2019 Volunteer of the Year Elaine Steffenauer told visitors on a recent day.</p>
<p>“Benito and Sapphira can both say ‘hi,’ but they don’t do it on command,” she explained. On that day both big birds remained silent.</p>
<p>Ms. Steffenauer, of Bethel Park, loves the unpaid part-time “job” she has “worked” for 11 years as a docent at the North Side bird zoo. She and other volunteers, clad in bright blue shirts and now wearing masks, enhance visits by telling people about the birds, including their names and ages and other interesting information about their behavior.</p>
<p>Many of the birds seemed to miss the visitors when the coronavirus pandemic caused the aviary to shut down for three months starting in March, Ms. Steffenauer said.</p>
<p>As if to illustrate her point, Gus, a great argus pheasant, strutted and unfurled his big tail feathers in the manner of the more familiar male peacock. Children were enchanted with the display.</p>
<p>Other birds, including Archie the boat-billed heron, perched on the rail inches away from Emily Lin, of New York City, and other visitors.</p>
<p>Docents always know where Wookie the sloth is hiding and will point him out to visitors.</p>
<p>Birds in the Tropical Forest and the Wetlands walk among and fly over visitors, seemingly unafraid of people. But the job of Ms. Steffenauer and other volunteers includes discreetly watching to make sure no one touches the birds.</p>
<p>“Birds don’t like to be touched, and they would hide from people” in the live trees and plants that mimic their natural habitats, she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Steffenauer’s animal-loving family has made frequent visits to the aviary, and she became a volunteer more than a decade ago. Her daughter, Anna, became an intern while a student at Brigham Young University, and she now works at the aviary as a senior aviculturist.</p>
<p>While Ms. Steffenauer was working full time in day care and early childhood education, she initially volunteered on Saturdays. After she retired last year, she stepped it up to 10-15 volunteer hours per week.</p>
<p>“It’s such an honor to be Volunteer of the Year, but all of the volunteers deserve the honor,” Ms. Steffenauer said.</p>
<p>Her “passion for engaging visitors” and her “strong leadership and expertise” earned her the Volunteer of the Year title, according to an aviary news release. Ms. Steffenauer “was among the first volunteers to return” after the COVID shutdown, the release said.</p>
<p>The aviary is not accepting applications for volunteer positions at this time because large training classes would not be able to follow social distancing precautions.</p>
<p>A limited number of people can visit the aviary but must go to aviary.org to book a date and time slot. All visitors and staff must wear masks at all times, and docents and staff politely make sure social distancing is practiced throughout the bird zoo.</p>
