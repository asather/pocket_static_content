<h1> Keith C. Burris | A parade of cynicism </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>How do we get to something real — a true debate and some substance — in the presidential campaign?</p>
<p>I am not a pollster and I am not a seer. I don’t pretend to know how the remainder of this odd campaign will unfold, not to mention what the outcome might be.</p>
<p>But I see some impediments to substance and honest talk. Some have to do with the sheer amount of blather and gossip in the blogosphere and electronic media.</p>
<p>But some are acts of cynicism — intentional distractions that only obscure real issues and divert our attention.</p>
<p>One cynicism is: You don’t need a program or a plan if you are not the other guy.</p>
<p>This is the Democratic cynicism. Instead of a positive program — what we used to call a platform — Joe Biden says: “I am not Trump.”</p>
<p>My gut tells me it will not be enough, politically.</p>
<p>But s<em>hould</em> it be enough, in a presidential election in the greatest democracy on earth?</p>
<p>It’s strange. I don’t remember any presidential candidate of this party, the programmatic and progressive party historically, running on character — the flawed character of the other guy.</p>
<p>And, substantially, no issues.</p>
<p>This is considered a viable strategy because the people who hate Mr. Trump hate him with a purple passion – without reason or limit.</p>
<p>But if you lay the hatred down for a minute you see that this really isn’t politics or persuasion, it is only reaction and superstition.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden at least got close to running on his <em>own</em> character when he said: You know me and I am no radical.</p>
<p>He ought to expand on that. What does he really believe, after 50 years in politics? What has he changed his mind about? And, you know, what would he do in the job of head of the federal government and commander-in-chief of the United States?</p>
<p>A second cynicism is: You can be unpresidential, indeed uncivil, as hell, if you mine the culture wars. This is a Trumpian and Republican delusion. I can behave in ways that no one would allow a school boy to behave and say irresponsible things — as long as I hold up a Bible in front of a church and say I like guns and hate abortion.</p>
<p>You can’t get much more cynical than that.</p>
<p>And a posture is not a conviction.</p>
<p>And, again, it is a strange play politically. The president actually has a platform. And a record. Why not run on these?</p>
<p>I have long thought the president would make a good prime minister. He is a forceful organizational leader. He gets things done. But he does not seem to understand that he is head of state as well as head of government. You don’t see Queen Elizabeth tweeting out that someone is a “loser,” or a “bad hombre.” He does not seem to grasp that diminishing his own office is not good for the country.</p>
<p>A third, cynicism, which is also Republican, is that all Biden Democrats are demonstrators and all demonstrators are rioters. Hence to be pro-Biden is to be pro-riot and an 80 year old retired nurse who has never participated in public life except to vote, but who might enthusiastically prefer Mr. Biden for president, is portrayed as the moral equal of an Antifa thug.</p>
<p>That’s pretty transparent, pretty dumb, and pretty insulting to a lot of sane and solid Americans.</p>
<p>But maybe the biggest cynicism, and maybe the most politically unsustainable and absurd one, is the simultaneous assertion by the woke and wannabe woke that, on the one hand, Joe Worker and most of middle America was properly shut down for almost half a year and may need to be shut down again, but those who wish to protest the country and insist that it is a racist country are entitled to the streets. No limits.</p>
<p>One group of people should stay home and collect unemployment. Another, ranging from the peaceful to the violent protesters, have something important to say and should therefore be accommodated.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that all kids should be in school, or all college kids in college, or that we are out of the woods with COVID.</p>
<p>But if one group of people have absolute freedom of association and assembly and should be trusted to their own judgment, should this not be the standard for all?</p>
<p>Isn’t the right to be employed and productive, and not a ward of the state, as important as protesting? Shouldn’t people who want to keep their restaurants and bars open so they can pay their bills also be accommodated?</p>
<p>This brings me to the ultimate cynicism, one at the heart of both parties and their candidates this year: I see no evidence that<em> either </em>has anything for middle America, or the middle <em>of</em> America. Both parties participated equally in the destruction of the American manufacturing base. Both are funded by Wall Street, which grew fat on the internationalism that caused the destruction of our factories. After Mr. Trump, who at least named what happened, the GOP will revert to “free trade.” And there is no sign that Mr. Biden will depart from the Clinton-Obama model of economic globalism.</p>
<p>Neither party has a jobs program for a pandemic. Mr. Trump’s jobs program is deregulation, which does create a boom in good times, though at some social cost. Mr. Biden’s, apparently, is any bailout larger than the going GOP bailout.</p>
<p>I call both cynicism.</p>
