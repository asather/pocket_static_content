<h1>Buying Here: International-style home in Shadyside priced at $2.25 million</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Joan and Jerry Apt loved entertaining friends and famous visitors at their modern home in Shadyside.</p>
<p>“It was just a terrific house for entertaining. I met everybody from Isaac Stern to Bob Prince,” said their son, Jay Apt,&nbsp;an astronaut and Carnegie Mellon University professor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He admitted he was more impressed with the Pittsburgh Pirates broadcaster than the violinist.&nbsp;“Bob Prince was more memorable to a young boy.”</p>
<p>The four-bedroom, 4½-bath home at <strong>40 Woodland Road</strong> is listed for $2.25 million (MLS No. 1447369) with Howard Hanna Real Estate Services agent Amy Bair (412-401-9460 or <a href="https://www.howardhanna.com/Property/Detail/40-Woodland-Rd-Shadyside-PA-15232/Westpenn/1447369" target="_blank">www.howardhanna.com</a>).</p>
<p>The modernist masterwork was built in 1951 and designed by Pittsburgh native A. James Speyer, who earned his architecture degree in 1934 from Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University. The Speyers and the Apts were friendly, Mr. Apt said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speyer, who studied with Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology, also designed the Ben Rose House near Chicago, a glass house featured in the 1986 comedy “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.”&nbsp;For 26 years, Speyer was a curator of contemporary American and European art at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
<p>Joan Apt, who co-founded Pittsburgh Public Theater, was a longtime fan of modern architecture. She grew up at 96 E. Woodland Road, which was designed by&nbsp;Bauhaus architects Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. Her parents, Robert and Cecelia “Cele” Frank, commissioned the sleek structure with a dramatic sweeping staircase. Breuer designed all of the furniture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“My mother and father were married in the garden of the Gropius house in 1947,” Mr. Apt said. “Her interest in both art and architecture was stimulated by growing up” there.</p>
<p>In 1951, she and her husband hired Speyer, who created an International-style structure clad in red brick and supported by white steel beams forged in Pittsburgh. The house has a flat roof, floor-to-ceiling windows and built-in bookcases and wooden storage cabinets made of mahogany, teak or oak. Its construction cost was&nbsp;$307,163, which is about $3 million in 2020 dollars.</p>
<p>Set on a wooded, 1.5-acre lot, the home includes an outdoor terrace that overlooks a garden and a three-car, heated garage with a laundry, pantry and workshop. By 1978, the Apts had added an asphalt tennis court where they played daily.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tucked into a hillside, the home provides privacy but is close to the Shadyside and Squirrel Hill business districts and two parks.</p>
<p>“I could walk to any place as a kid,” Mr. Apt recalled. “The Chatham College campus was not as busy then as it is now.&nbsp;I could walk to Forbes and Murray, walk to Walnut Street, Mellon Park or Schenley Park.”</p>
<p>During the summer, the family slung a hammock between two large trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I would just disappear down there and read. It was really quite lovely,” Mr. Apt said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a long driveway framed by a stone wall, visitors descend 17 steps to the home’s entrance. Inside is a large reception area and a powder room.&nbsp;Beyond the foyer is a living room with a great view of the Chatham University campus and a log-burning fireplace framed by arched brick. A wooden cabinet hides a built-in bar with a refrigerator and a pass-through connects the living room and the kitchen.</p>
<p>A curtain divides the living room from the dining room, which overlooks the terrace and garden. A breakfast room also overlooks that terrace and links the dining room with the kitchen.</p>
<p>The kitchen boasts original St. Charles steel cabinets, a Frigidaire refrigerator made by General Motors and stainless-steel counters. There is a bar sink and utility area for storing tools and supplies. A dumbwaiter was converted into an elevator that leads to the garage.</p>
<p>Off the kitchen is another wing with two small bedrooms, a bathroom and office that were used by live-in staff.&nbsp;In the residential wing, each of the four bedrooms has a built-in desk, bookshelves and built-in drawers concealed by wooden cabinets. The bathrooms feature different shades of marble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The property’s assessment, which includes the house and a vacant lot, is $654,000. Over the last three years, two homes have sold in this block of Woodland Road, one for $970,623 in July 2018 and the other for $1.6 million in October 2018 (<a href="http://www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/Default.aspx" target="_blank">www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/Default.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>Mrs. Apt celebrated her 90th birthday at the house.</p>
<p>“She was born on the Fourth of July,” her son said. “She organized it all herself.&nbsp;It was a tremendous amount of fun.”</p>
