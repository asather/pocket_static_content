<h1>Pittsburgh restaurants sue insurer over COVID-19-related losses</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Restaurants in Highland Park and Ross Township have filed civil lawsuits in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas against their Erie County insurer, seeking class action status and claiming the financial losses sustained during the COVID-19 pandemic should be covered by their policies.</p>
<p>Joseph Tambellini Restaurant on Bryant Street and Siebs Pub on Babcock Boulevard filed three- and two-count lawsuits respectively against Erie Insurance Exchange in what are believed to be the first of their kind in Pennsylvania, according to lawyer Scott Cooper, from the Harrisburg firm of Schmidt Kramer P.C., who is representing the restaurant owners.</p>
<p>Erie Insurance officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>

<p>The lawsuits are seeking business income and related losses that occurred after Gov. Tom Wolf ordered nonessential business to close on March 19 to contain the rapid spread of the new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. John P. Goodrich from the Downtown firm Jack Goodrich &amp; Associates is serving as local counsel.</p>
<p>Similar lawsuits have been filed in California and Louisiana.</p>
<p>Business interruption insurance, which has been around since the 1880s, covers the loss of income due to fire, flood or other disaster. Insurance industry officials have said some policies specifically exclude losses due to viruses or bacteria and paying COVID-19-related claims would easily exceed the carriersâ€™ surplus for satisfying all claims.</p>
