<h1>Joe Musgrove to start Wednesday against Cubs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Joe Musgrove will start Wednesday against the Cubs at PNC Park, manager Derek Shelton announced after Tuesday’s loss.</p>
<p>Musgrove — the Pirates’ opening day starter — has not pitched since Aug. 4 because of right triceps inflammation and right ankle discomfort. This will be Musgrove’s fourth start of the season.</p>
<p>Musgrove is 0-3 this season with a 6.75 ERA. He has struck out 17 in 14⅔&nbsp;innings, although control has been an issue at times. The right-hander has 11 walks in those three starts.</p>
<p>Derek Holland was supposed to start Wednesday’s game. Shelton said the Pirates were still deciding whether Holland would work out of the bullpen or have his start pushed back.</p>
