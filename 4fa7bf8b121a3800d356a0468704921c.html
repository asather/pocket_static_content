<h1>Pitcher Blake Cederlind among the Pirates' first cuts of spring training</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Blake Cederlind did not leave LECOM Park on Monday empty-handed.</p>
<p>It also might not take him terribly long to reunite with the Pirates at PNC Park or another MLB ballpark.</p>
<p>As Pittsburgh made its first round of spring training cuts, the blond-haired reliever with the power sinker and nasty stuff was the focal point because of the promise he showed and how exciting it was to watch him pitch.</p>
<p>Cederlind made quite an impression on pretty much everyone here, and it’ll be interesting to see how he’s able to carry a strong spring into the regular season.</p>
<p>“I got a taste of it,” Cederlind said. “I’ve seen what it was like. See how quick I can get back here.”</p>
<p>All six of the Pirates’ cuts thus far — six more are coming after Monday’s game against the Blue Jays — involved pitchers, as they optioned JT Brubaker, Cederlind and Cody Ponce to Class AAA Indianapolis and reassigned Montana DuRapau, Luis Escobar and James Marvel to minor-league camp.</p>
<p>In five games, Cederlind allowed no hits and an unearned run with nine strikeouts and four walks. Only Mitch Keller — 10 in nine innings — fanned more.</p>
<p>“I had a great time,” Cederlind said. “I just want to thank the guys in the organization for making it so cool, but it’s still time to go down there and work.”</p>
<p>The sinker triggered a busy 2019 season for Cederlind, who started the year with High-A Bradenton. He dominated that level and also with Class AA Altoona, pitching to a 1.77 ERA with 42 strikeouts against 16 walks before a late-season promotion to Class AAA.</p>
<p>The biggest reason was the sinker, which meshed perfectly with the lack of spin Cederlind had on his fastball. He’ll also need to refine his cutter and changeup, with the second of those needing a little extra work.</p>
<p>“I know what I need to do,” Cederlind said.</p>
<p>Cederlind’s time here included some solid pitching and plenty of humor. During one outing, he fell down, the result of a beat-up pair of spikes he refused to stop wearing. Nothing else felt right, Cederlind explained. So he stuck with ones that were fraying and ineffective.</p>
<p>During his time with the big club, Cederlind said the Pirates’ clubhouse attendants found a pair that will work for him. Same model, but about three years old. Finicky about what he wears on his feet, Cederlind spent he spent a good six innings filing them down to meet his specifications.</p>
<p>“It was a six-inning process,” he said. “My right arm was ready to go when I got in there.”</p>
<p>The funniest part of Cederlind’s exit interview might’ve been what he revealed about his pitching face: a mean, crazy-looking scowl. Apparently his girlfriend sent him a photo with four different images of it put together.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘Oh, Lord.’ They were tough,” Cederlind said. “No one else makes those faces?”</p>
<p>Brubaker will be another pitcher for Pirates fans to track during the early part of the regular season.</p>
<p>The righty made just six starts in 2019, the result of a right forearm strain that lingered and ultimately shelved the Pirates’ 2018 Minor League Pitcher of the Year.</p>
<p>“It felt good,” Brubaker said. “I was excited to get back out there on the mound facing hitters. To be able to tell myself I’m able to go out there and compete, having no worries, it was really a confidence boost. Now it’s just getting built up and ready for the season.”</p>
<p>In two games this spring, Brubaker allowed one earned run on two hits and a walk with three strikeouts over 2⅓&nbsp;innings.</p>
<p>A focal point for Brubaker will be making sure he works the top of the strike zone with his fastball and developing his curveball to use lower in the zone as a complement to his two-seam slider.</p>
<p>“It gives me more of a pitch mix,” Brubaker said.</p>
