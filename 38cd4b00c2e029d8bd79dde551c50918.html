<h1>Pitt-Syracuse observations: Rashad Weaver's return, Jordan Addison's emergence and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rashad Weaver couldn’t sleep on Friday night. Pitt’s 6-foot-5, 270-pound pass-rusher — a 22-year-old fifth-year senior — admitted he felt like a little kid on Christmas Eve, lying in bed anxious for the next day to arrive.</p>
<p>“I was there with my eyes closed for like 30 minutes trying to fall asleep,” Weaver said with a laugh after Saturday’s win over Syracuse. “Then after I finally fell asleep, I woke up at 3:40 in the morning energized, checking my phone and hoping it was 7 o’clock. I was very eager. I tried to control it the best I could, but I couldn’t.”</p>
<p>It’s hard to blame Weaver for his unbridled giddiness.</p>
<p>Prior to Saturday, Weaver hadn’t played in an ACC game since the 2018 championship against Clemson at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C. That, of course, is where the Panthers want to end up again this December. If they do, Weaver reminded everyone Saturday that he’ll be an instrumental reason why.</p>
<p>Weaver, who missed the 2019 season with an ACL tear and watched last weekend’s opener at home, returned to Heinz Field with a sense of urgency and purpose. Pitt’s 2018 sacks leader logged a couple on Saturday, recording a pair of half-sacks in the first quarter and ripping down Syracuse’s Tommy DeVito by himself in the third.</p>

<p>Weaver said he “left a lot of plays out there” and even critiqued his own tackling technique on one of his sacks. But after being forced to look on from the sideline last year as Pitt terrorized ACC backfields and led the nation in sacks per game, Weaver finally got in on the fun following a 14-game absence.</p>
<p>“I thought he looked outstanding,” head coach Pat Narduzzi said. “It was great to get him and Keyshon Camp back.”</p>
<p>Weaver and Camp, who missed all but one game in 2019 with a knee injury of his own, made their season debuts after not being in attendance for the Austin Peay opener. The defensive linemen were among the seven Pitt players held out due to COVID-related protocols, with Weaver tweeting his frustrations about different testing companies producing different results.</p>
<p>Weaver said the ordeal, not knowing if he tested positive or negative for the coronavirus, is in the past now. Narduzzi confirmed that Weaver and Camp practiced throughout the week in anticipation of the ACC opener, and they didn’t look rusty.</p>
<p>Weaver’s half-sacks came on back-to-back plays in the first quarter, as Syracuse inched closer to midfield in a 7-3 ballgame. And his third-quarter takedown was one of Pitt’s most important defensive plays of the day.</p>
<p>After an ugly three-and-out to start the second half, Pitt was vulnerable. The Orange, down only four, moved to Pitt’s 43-yard line and faced a fourth-and-3 decision that wasn’t much of a decision. Syracuse squandered its first-half chances in Pitt territory, and with an opportunity to nab momentum when it had little business being in the game, Dino Babers had to take a chance.</p>
<p>But Weaver bolted off the ball and beat Syracuse’s offensive tackle with ease. Weaver wondered postgame if the lineman thought his assignment was elsewhere. But when the tackle tried to re-engage, Weaver was already by him. Pitt’s powerful pass-rusher grabbed DeVito by the waist and swung him down to the Heinz Field turf — ending Syracuse’s threat to score and highlighting his long-awaited return.</p>
<p>“Having him out there, there’s like a different confidence,” senior safety Damar Hamlin said. “He’s a game-changer. ... He’s just a force and a presence. I can’t wait to keep playing with him.”</p>
<p><strong>Addison’s emergence</strong></p>
<p>Hamlin thinks wide receiver Jordan Addison is destined to be a freshman All-American. And you don’t have to look far to see where he gets that belief.</p>
<p>Through two games, Addison is Pitt’s most targeted pass-catcher, and it’s not even close. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/09/03/jordan-addison-pitt-football-wide-receivers-2020/stories/202009020090" target="_blank">The talked-about freshman</a> has been targeted 17 times by quarterback Kenny Pickett. The senior’s second-most targeted options are Shocky Jacques-Louis and DJ Turner, who have been targeted seven times each.</p>
<p>Addison had seven catches last weekend and another seven catches against Syracuse. The Maryland native caught his first career touchdown pass, a 27-yard score on a sharp throw from Pickett. Addison also picked up a pair of first downs, including a savvy 12-yard gain on a third-and-10.</p>

<p>Nothing about Addison’s hot start — not the 131 scrimmage yards (92 receiving, 39 rushing) or the head’s up plays — should be expected of a true freshman. But Addison doesn’t seem surprised. And neither does Pickett, which is telling.</p>
<p>“Early on, I saw his talent level. He’s a special kid, even off the field with his personality,” the captain said. “It’s like he’s a junior or a sophomore. It’s not like he’s a true freshman the way he goes about his business.”</p>
<p>“I feel like all of that is paying off. Coming in early, learning the playbook, getting a connection with Kenny Pickett, all of that is great,” Addison added. “I’m now getting more comfortable. ... It’s feeling like home now.”</p>
<p><strong>Chunk play count</strong></p>
<p>Pitt’s live stats page makes note of both teams’ “chunk plays,” defined as a completion of 15 yards or more or a rush of 10-plus yards. Each week, we’ll see which team won the chunk play count — a good indicator of which offense did enough to win.</p>
<p>Pitt limited Syracuse to four chunk plays, three on the ground and one in the air. The Orange’s lone pass of 15 yards or more was Rex Culpepper’s 69-yard touchdown, a direct result of a busted coverage on Pitt’s end.</p>
<p>The Panthers had 10 chunk plays, six through the air and four on the ground. Pickett had completions of 27 and 20 yards to Addison, a 25-yard toss to Jared Wayne, a 17-yard scoring strike to Wayne, a 20-yard pass to Turner and a 19-yard screen to running back Vincent Davis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Davis had rushes of 11 and 14 yards, Addison had a 13-yard jet sweep, and Todd Sibley rumbled for a 13-yard gain out of the Wildcat package.</p>

<p><strong>Quick hits</strong></p>
<p>•&nbsp;Pitt’s offense should consider itself lucky that Syracuse’s offense is pretty much inept.</p>
<p>The Orange’s second and third drives of the game started at the Pitt 35-yard line and 14-yard line, respectively, thanks to a three-and-out and a lost fumble. Syracuse somehow managed only three points from those two scenarios. But with the early mistakes, it felt like Pitt’s 2019 ACC opener against Virginia, a game in which the Panthers gifted the Cavaliers short field after short field en route to a loss.</p>
<p>Pitt dodged a bullet or two against Syracuse. But it can’t afford the same mishaps against the likes of Clemson, Notre Dame and even Louisville next weekend.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Speaking of mishaps, Florida transfer Lucas Krull had a couple of inexcusable drops in his debut — an issue Pitt fans pray doesn’t become a season-long problem. They’ve seen too many grad transfer tight ends underwhelm under Narduzzi and Tim Salem.</p>
<p>“He dropped one, came back and caught one, then dropped another one that was right there,” Narduzzi said, referencing a drop beyond the sticks on third-and-10 in the fourth quarter. “I don’t need to beat him up. He’ll beat himself up over that. ... Maybe it was first-game (jitters) being the guy. But we expect him to make those plays.”</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Even with a committee approach lurking, Vincent Davis is tightening his grip on the first-team running back job.</p>
<p>Davis, a speedy sophomore who out-touched A.J. Davis and others by a mile in last year’s Quick Lane Bowl, is doing the same early this season. After 11 carries in the opener, Vincent Davis had a career-high 18 carries for 53 yards against Syracuse, adding two catches for 26 yards.</p>
<p>Comparatively, A.J. Davis had 11 carries for 37 yards and struggled catching the ball out of the backfield. Veteran tailback Todd Sibley and redshirt freshman Daniel Carter earned two carries each, while true freshman Israel Abanikanda played but didn’t tally a touch.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Weaver deserves a lot of credit for how he played Saturday. But so do Pitt’s backup defensive linemen.</p>
<p>Defensive ends Deslin Alexandre and John Morgan logged sacks, with the former recovering a fumble (before spinning it in celebration and picking up a silly flag). Central Catholic grad David Green picked up a half sack, and redshirt freshman Calijah Kancey tallied 2.5 tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks.</p>
<p>Kancey, a guy who was described several times by Narduzzi as “electric” during training camp, even got a shoutout by former Pitt star Jaylen Twyman on Twitter. “Kancey is one of our best (defensive linemen),” Twyman posted. “Just watch!”</p>

<p>• Pitt stayed relatively healthy but did lose one contributor for at least the game.</p>
<p>Fullback and former walk-on Jake Zilinskas, a fifth-year senior who earned a scholarship during training camp, went down in pain with an ankle injury in the first half and did not return.</p>
<p>Zilinskas is not expected to miss significant time. But he does have an unfortunate leg injury in his past — a torn hamstring as a senior at Indiana Area High School, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/09/11/jake-zilinskas-pitt-football-walk-on-indiana-area/stories/202009100105" target="_blank">one that required a lengthy rehab process</a>. Zilinskas was forced to go the Division III route due to a lack of interest post-surgery before walking on at Pitt.</p>
<p>In his place, tight end Kyi Wright and linebacker Brandon George alternated at fullback in Pitt’s heavy package.&nbsp;</p>
