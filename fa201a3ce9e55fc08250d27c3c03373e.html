<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sharpsville high school senior Maxine Schell has been working as the team manager for the girls basketball team the past four years.</p>
<p>After spending her entire high school career on the sidelines, Maxine, a learning support student, finally got her chance to suit up and hit the hardwood.</p>
<p>Maxine not only dressed for senior night Wednesday evening, but ended the game with five points, according to Bob Greenburg, who shared a video to Twitter of Maxine draining a huge 3-pointer. The video shows the crowd erupting as Maxine’s teammates run over to her and celebrate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Greenburg said Maxine’s sister, Izzy Schell, recorded the video of the super star’s big moment and asked him to share it with his followers. “THAT’S MY SIS!!!,” Izzy wrote on Twitter. “literally couldn’t be more proud...nobody deserves this more than her.”</p>
<p>Sharspville, in Mercer County, fell to Grove City, 62-32.</p>
