<h1>Steelers dial up more work for rookie guard Kevin Dotson</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What could’ve been the first significant injury of Steelers training camp has instead turned into a tale of a rookie coming on strong. Fourth-round pick Kevin Dotson is getting a shot to show what he can do at guard, sometimes even with the first-team offense, two weeks after leaving practice with a knee injury.</p>
<p>Dotson likely won’t start this season, but his first camp could be one you look back on a year or two or even a decade later as the origin story of a newcomer who quietly established himself as a man who knows how to block things.</p>
<p>“It was kind of a wake-up call that it can be over quick, so I have to make my impact fast,” Dotson said Monday, following a practice after which he was selected to speak with the media. “I need to do what I can right now because I never know what could happen in the future.”</p>
<p>The chances for Dotson to make a quick contribution dropped precipitously when the usual offseason activities went fully virtual. Then, he got hurt the second day of camp. But Friday night, in a scrimmage-like atmosphere at Heinz Field, he was back participating with no limitations and looked the part of a bruising blocker.</p>
<p>Dotson played right guard in the rain and teamed with Zach Banner at tackle to pave the way for some big runs. He even did some work at the second level, showing the combination of strength and mobility that made him a four-year starter at Louisiana-Lafayette.</p>
<p>“Getting in the game definitely was something I really wanted to do,” he said. “I really wanted to make my impact and get seen, just because if you know me or my dad, you know that I’m not the person to sit out for a long time.”</p>
<p>Indeed, when Dotson was drafted, he relayed what his father — and also his coach at Plaquemine High School — always told him and his twin, Kenny, growing up. You’re either hurt, or you’re injured. Dotson was hurt plenty of times in college, but an injury never caused him to miss a game.</p>
<p>“I feel like if I sit out, people start to think that you're soft or you don't want to really work or be out there,” Dotson said. “It was kind of my proving time, and the fact I got to go in there with the ‘1’s was just an added bonus.”</p>
<p>At 6-feet-4, 321 pounds, no one is calling No. 69 soft. Dotson doesn't like to think about what could’ve been if he had a real offseason under his belt, but for a rookie getting his first taste of the NFL game coming from a Sun Belt Conference program, he was matter-of-fact about his mentality.</p>
<p>In his interview Monday, he was more stern and all-business than the smiley, talkative draft pick who grew up a Steelers fan. Dotson seems less concerned with soaking in the experience than he is trying to solve 300-pound problems like Cam Heyward and Stephon Tuitt in practice.</p>
<p>“I’d say it’s given me a lot of confidence because I feel like I can hold my own against them,” Dotson said. “I know that’s quality competition, and if I can hold up against them, I can hold up against a lot of people.”</p>
<p>As Chukwuma Okorafor and Banner battle it out for the right tackle job, and veteran Stefen Wisniewski works as the top backup at all three interior lineman spots, Dotson is seventh or eighth in the pecking order — for now. Veteran right guard David DeCastro is already dealing with a lower-body injury that coach Mike Tomlin hasn't shed much light on, and even once the season starts, whoever wins the fifth starting spot will need to prove he can keep it.</p>
<p>While the Steelers’ offensive line has been a model of stability for the past four years with the likes of DeCastro, Maurkice Pouncey, Al Villanueva and the now-retired Ramon Foster, they’ve lost at least two starters for multiple games due to injury or suspension four seasons in a row. A year ago it was Foster and Pouncey, the two seasons before that it was Marcus Gilbert, and in 2016 Foster and Gilbert both missed multiple games. Villanueva got his start in 2015 because left tackle Kelvin Beachum went down in Week 6 and missed the rest of the season, so it pays to have young talent ready.</p>
<p>“All of them kind of take me under their wing. Any time they see me messing up, they kind of correct it or help me. I feel like Villanueva’s probably one of the most vocal to me,” Dotson said. “He feels like I’m in the situation he was when he first got here; he was on practice squad and stuff like that.”</p>
<p>At this point, Dotson might be too valuable — and too close to being one snap away — to land on the practice squad. If anything, his barrel-chested body and long arms have him looking like a rookie ready to roll.</p>
<p>“He’s just missed a lot of padded work, and hopefully that exposure has been helpful to him. Also, during the time he was down, he hasn’t missed any meetings or mental preparations,” Tomlin said Friday. “I’m sure there’s an adjustment. It’s probably more of an adjustment given the fact that he has very little resume to speak of, but such is life, things he has to deal with. We will work hard to give him opportunities to catch up and display his understanding.”</p>
