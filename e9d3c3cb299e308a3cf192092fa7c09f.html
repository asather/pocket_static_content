<h1>Unmasked poll workers at Allderdice polling place prompts complaint from voter </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two poll workers reportedly not wearing masks Tuesday morning at the Allderdice High School polling location prompted a complaint from a voter concerned about COVID-19.</p>
<p>Allegheny County swiftly addressed the issue, and Amie Downs, the county’s spokeswoman, said it was resolved by reminding the poll workers that they must be masked. Ms. Downs said that is recommended but optional for voters to wear masks. Also, a voter at the Bethel Park High School polling place said that not all poll workers there were wearing masks.</p>
<p>Dawn Marie Smith, 31, headed to the school to vote around 7:45 a.m. and found a bustling location.</p>
<p>“It was very crowded and hectic, and they were telling people to stay six feet apart but no one was six feet apart,” said Smith, a program coordinator for Just Harvest, a nonprofit that works to reduce hunger.</p>
<p>Voters wore masks, Smith said, but a male elections official assisting people and a woman working at the table where voters were checking in were not. Smith said the worker was elderly and hard of hearing and leaned closer and closer to hear.</p>
<p>Compounding the issue for Smith was having to cast a provisional ballot because a ballot requested by mail never arrived.</p>
<p>“There were several minutes of confusion over that and other people getting very close to me during the confusion trying to sort it out,” Smith said. “People with provisional ballots were sent over to vote on a couple of tables that basically had binders set up like in elementary school when you’re trying to keep kids from cheating. And there weren’t enough of them, so people were just voting openly on the tables. So then I voted and got out of there. But it was a lot of close quarters with people, not very good distancing, and at least two or three people without masks who got within a foot of me.”</p>
<p>That potential exposure to COVID-19 concerned Smith, whose mother is in her 60s and has underlying health issues..</p>
<p>Smith, whose usual polling place on Murray Avenue was consolidated, voted in the Ward 14 location on the school’s ground floor. Smith said there were no markings on the ground to designate six feet of spacing between voters.</p>
<p>“I had sort of expected it to be a one-way in, one-way out,” but it wasn’t, “so you had to walk around people on your way in or out.”</p>
<p>Smith said one voter made a comment to the male poll worker about his lack of a mask.</p>
<p>“There was a guy who had come to the wrong table because he was supposed to be voting at [Ward] 15. [The worker] had been called over to the line next to mine. He was talking to the guy and he said something the masks, and the guy said, ‘You don’t have one on.’ And he said, ‘I would have to keep taking it off for people to be able to hear me.’ “</p>
<p>Smith voted, left, applied hand sanitizer and then fired off a tweet to Allegheny County. It said; “Love to see the @Allegheny_Co election officials at my polling place not wearing masks and risking my life”</p>
<p>Six minutes later the county’s Twitter feed responded asking about which polling place. Smith provided the information, and the county wrote: “Thank you for the information. We are addressing the situation now.”</p>
<p>Ms. Downs confirmed that the county had taken care of the issue.</p>
<p>“Poll workers are required to wear masks,” she said. “If they are unwilling to do so, they will be asked to leave. In this case, Elections officials called and reminded them of exactly that.”</p>
<p>She said there have been no other similar complaints in the county.</p>
