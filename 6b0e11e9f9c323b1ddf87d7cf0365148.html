<h1>Computer screens are the new conference room and dogs are, sometimes, welcome</h1>

<p>“What do you do when a dog barks? Apologize,” said Matthew Walerysiak, the civil engineering services division manager at Markosky Engineering in Ligonier. “You get used to dogs barking or kids screaming. You kinda just let it go and move on.”</p>
<p>Mr. Walerysiak says he’s gotten to meet more of his coworkers’ dogs and cats than he would have otherwise.</p>
<p>Many offices closed after the new coronavirus swept through Western Pennsylvania, leaving employees to figure out how to work from home. Video conferencing sites like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Skype and Google Hangouts skyrocketed in popularity but learning how to use them allowed for some interesting learning experiences.</p>
<p>Stories of pets interrupting meetings, professionals logging on in pajamas and family members accidentally flashing the camera, circulated the internet for months when virtual meetings first became popular.</p>
<p>Business development engineer Steven Mezzacappa at Turner Construction says his dog interrupts him during video calls.</p>
<p>“He decides to sleep all day and then, when I’m on a call, he’s up,” he said.</p>
<p>Doug Sanner, one of the sales supervisors at Ford Business Machines based in Connellsville, has two American labs. Remy is a 1-year-old silver lab and the other, Mila, is a 6-year-old black lab. He says they are the “best alarm system around” but they can be distracting when trying to work from home.</p>
<p>Auberle’s chief strategy officer, Lauren Brown, says her co-worker Darla Poole runs a dog sanctuary.</p>
<p>“When you see Darla go on mute, you know there are like six dogs barking there,” she said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Generally, company employees suggest running a virtual meeting like any other: start on time, keep an agenda and end on time.</p>
<p>“Go into it as if it’s a live meeting. Being focused and having an agenda makes a big difference,” said Mr. Mezzacappa. “You can tell when someone is looking at something else,” he said.</p>
<p>Turner Construction is a national company that mainly does commercial building projects. The U.S. Steel building Downtown, PPG Science Pavilion at the Carnegie Science Center on the North Side and Thomas Jefferson High School in Jefferson Hills are just a few examples of projects that the company has worked on.</p>
<p>The staff members are doing their best to stay in touch while working from home. Mr. Mezzacappa says he is in video calls all day sometimes, most between staff members. They also have a weekly video call with their CEO to check in.</p>
<p>Ms. Brown estimates that Auberle, the regional social services agency out of McKeesport, has at least 250 virtual meetings between staff each week. Supervisors meet weekly with staff members one-on-one; teams and leadership each meet monthly.</p>
<p>Auberle’s work involves keeping families together, helping find housing for homeless people and prevention services.</p>
<p>Ms. Brown recommends making sure every meeting isn’t something that could’ve been an email.</p>
<p>Staff are encouraged to give feedback and express their feelings on how things are run. She says it’s important to provide everyone with the opportunity to speak, especially if there are a lot of people in the meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanner says he usually attends three to six virtual company meetings a week, not including those with clients. The “south team” he works with out of Connellsville usually has a morning kick-off meeting and afternoon wrap-up.</p>
<p>Ford Business Machines (not associated with the automobile manufacturer) is a family-owned company that sells copiers, printers, and other multi-function technology from brands like Canon and Ricoh to offices.</p>
<p>Mr. Walerysiak of Markosky Engineering in Ligonier attends and runs three to four meetings via Microsoft Teams a day.</p>
<p>During the Monday morning “huddle,” he discusses with his staff what everyone is working on for the week. There isn’t an agenda but he still tracks time to make sure it doesn’t go too long.</p>
<p>“A lot of times you have people jump on a meeting in the middle or leave meetings toward the end because they’re done,” he said. “That’s a little different than an on-site meeting where once you get there you stay for the whole thing.”</p>
<p>Turner Construction’s Pittsburgh office is very close-knit, according to Mr. Mezzacappa. When the office first closed, they started doing virtual happy hours to get everyone used to Zoom.</p>
<p>“They were fun, people would show up in costumes and play around with the background,” he said. “We got to see each other’s families, too, which was nice.”</p>
<p>But he says that virtual meetings are hard because there is no time after to catch up with co-workers and build relationships.</p>
<p>“We are trying to work out ways that we can get together in some form without putting anybody at risk,” Mr. Walerysiak said. “It’s not the same, but it’s close. As close as we can get right now.”</p>
<p>He pointed out having the camera on helps a meeting between a few people feel more socially connected, but it’s not that simple in conference calls with lots of people because it takes a lot of bandwidth to load so many videos.</p>
<p>Ms. Brown says she misses the intimacy of in-person meetings but admits there is a huge benefit in meeting virtually.</p>
<p>It has actually doubled the turnout for their monthly management meeting, which 20 people would show up for in person but 40 people show up for on Zoom.</p>
<p>“Working from home is much more accessible,” she said. “I don’t know why we would ever go back if it’s made turnout better.”</p>
