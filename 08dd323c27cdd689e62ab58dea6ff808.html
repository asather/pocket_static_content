<h1>My Fat Thursday in New Orleans —  and 3 more days of great eats</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s easy to find cheap, authentic food in New Orleans. What’s hard is trying to eat everything your friends and co-workers suggest.</p>
<p>My wife and I arrived on a Sunday afternoon, unpacked at our Airbnb in Faubourg Marigny and headed for the French Quarter, whose streets were jammed with daiquiri-, Hurricane- and beer-drinking LSU and Clemson football fans warming up for the the College Football Playoff National Championship Game the next night at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.</p>
<p>The fried chicken and biscuits were top-notch at <a href="https://willieschickenshackneworleans.com/" target="_blank">Willie’s Chicken Shack</a>. The jambalaya had plenty of rice and Creole heat, but not enough chicken and Andouille sausage.</p>
<p>I had the same gripe with the gumbo at <a href="https://www.turtlebayneworleans.com/" target="_blank">Turtle Bay</a>, but loved the draft <a href="https://portorleansbrewingco.com/beers/gleason-pale-ale/?category=limited" target="_blank">Gleason India Pale Ale</a> made by Port Orleans Brewing Co. Named for former Saints safety Steve Gleason, this hazy ale (5.8% alcohol) helps raise money for people like him living with Lou Gehrig’s disease.</p>
<p>Other local beers I liked were <a href="https://urbansouthbrewery.com/beers/holy-roller" target="_blank">Holy Roller</a>, a hazy, juicy, 6.3% IPA by Urban South Brewery, and <a href="https://www.crescentcitybrewhouse.com/beer.html" target="_blank">Red Stallion</a>, a 5.8% Vienna-style dark lager from Crescent City Brewhouse.&nbsp;Lawrence, an engaging Saints fan with a diamond earring and gold nail polish, served me a 24-ounce draft from the brewery’s takeout window. I confess I felt no guilt drinking while walking the streets in broad daylight.</p>
<p>The next day, I made the first of three beignet runs to <a href="https://shop.cafedumonde.com/beignets/" target="_blank">Cafe du Monde</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cafebeignet.com/" target="_blank">Cafe Beignet</a>.&nbsp;Every bite of fried dough and powdered sugar reminded me of the fasnachts my mother used to make with my Alsatian-American grandmother’s recipe. It was our family’s Fat Tuesday treat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crawfish and po’boys were also on my list. I got them in one sandwich at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tarantos-crawfish-poboys-seafood-129272077517/" target="_blank">Taranto’s Crawfish</a> in Biloxi, Mississippi. If there is such a thing as a lobster hoagie, this is what it would taste like.</p>
<p>The night of the football game, we decided to stay away from downtown and the French Quarter to try a classic burger place recommended by <a href="https://nola.eater.com/maps/best-burgers-new-orleans-nola" target="_blank">Eater.com</a>. <a href="http://www.brownbutterrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Brown Butter Southern Kitchen and Bar</a> served up a great bacon cheddar burger and one of the best brisket sandwiches I’ve ever had, topped with house-made barbecue sauce, fried jalapeno and coleslaw.</p>
<p>Speaking of slaw on a sandwich, I was reminded of Primanti’s the morning I stepped inside <a href="https://centralgrocery.com/" target="_blank">Central Grocery and Deli</a>, home of the original muffuletta.&nbsp;The story is that Salvatore Lupo, a Sicilian immigrant, invented the sandwich in the early 1900s when he noticed market workers combining his lunch meats with round loaves from a nearby bakery.</p>
<p>Since I’d had two Cafe du Monde beignets for breakfast, I saved my muffuletta for lunch. I still struggled to finish half of this monster layered with olive salad, salami, ham, mortadella and Swiss and provolone cheeses.</p>
<p>I was so full that I managed only a bite of my wife’s fried chicken from <a href="http://www.williemaesnola.com/" target="_blank">Willie Mae’s Scotch House</a>, which some say is the best in the world. But I did find room for Willie Mae’s heavenly green beans. I didn’t eat a thing for the rest of the day, my Fat Thursday.</p>
