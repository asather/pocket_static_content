<h1>Judge denies defense request for mistrial over witness payments; seals motion</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The judge overseeing the Wilkinsburg mass murder trial on Friday denied a defense motion for a mistrial based on allegations that authorities furnished information to a key jailhouse witness that helped drive the investigation and then paid the witness in exchange for his testimony — all without disclosing it.</p>
<p>“For the second time in 30 days, the commonwealth has been caught providing financial assistance to a jailhouse witness in exchange for his testimony ... fabricated testimony,” Randall McKinney, who represents defendant Cheron Shelton, argued to Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski after jurors were dismissed for the day following a full week of trial.</p>
<p>“They made their bed and they should be forced to lie in it, your honor,” Mr. McKinney said.</p>
<p>Mr. McKinney said that the witness came forward on Monday, the first day of trial, to&nbsp;“proactively” give information that would be known only through his relationship with police and prosecutors.</p>
<p>He called the matter one of “grave public concern” and said the prosecution’s conduct involving a different jailhouse informant had already led to homicide charges being thrown out Monday by Judge Borkowski against Shelton’s former co-defendant, Robert Thomas.</p>
<p>The judge dismissed those charges because of a lack of evidence after prosecutors opted against using a witness, referred to as Witness 3, who had received financial consideration and relocation services from the authorities, which wasn’t disclosed to defense lawyers until shortly before the trial began.</p>
<p>The witness referred to Friday by Mr. McKinney is apparently one of two other unnamed witnesses who led, in part, to arrest warrants for Shelton and Thomas in connection with the March 9, 2016, slayings of five adults and an unborn child at a backyard cookout on Franklin Avenue in Wilkinsburg. If Shelton is found guilty, he could face the death penalty.</p>
<p>Mr. McKinney claimed that authorities delayed charging Shelton until June 2016 “because they were waiting on their snitches to get their work done.”</p>
<p>He said that the witness was told to get close to Shelton, who was in jail at the time on a probation violation and a receiving stolen property charge, and to get him to implicate himself and discuss the case.</p>
<p>“Instead he chose not to,” Mr. McKinney said. “Instead he implicated Robert Thomas.”</p>
<p>In denying Mr. McKinney’s motion, Judge Borkowski noted —&nbsp;as he did Monday — that dealing with cooperating witnesses can be a treacherous affair.</p>
<p>Although Mr. McKinney appealed to the judge to delay the trial in order to have a hearing on the motion and allow the witness to testify in open court, the judge declined. Mr. McKinney said a brief delay for such a hearing was a small inconvenience when compared with Shelton’s life.</p>
<p>But the judge said such a hearing could involve 20 to 30 witnesses, subpoenas and testimony from the witness, who is out of state.</p>
<p>“The court will not allow this witness to blow up or terminate this trial or even delay it,” Judge Borkowski said.</p>
<p>The motion is under seal, meaning the public does not have access to it.</p>
<p>The judge denied a request by Mr. McKinney to make the filing publicly available and said he planned to keep it under seal until the end of the trial.</p>
<p>In making his pitch for a mistrial, Mr. McKinney referred to “off-books payments” to the witness that could be corroborated by a lawyer — not identified in court — who could testify Monday. Mr. McKinney said that over the years when defense attorneys have asked prosecutors about payments to witnesses, they would get the same answer.</p>
<p>“What are you giving him in exchange? We were always told, ‘Nothing,’ “ Mr. McKinney said.</p>
<p>But Mr. McKinney indicated that is not the case —&nbsp;not with the witness linked to the case against Thomas, and not with the witness who prompted the new request for a mistrial.</p>
<p>“Your honor, it is a pattern, and it is intentional. They are paying witnesses without telling us and giving witnesses information that only law enforcement would know in assisting getting more information from our clients to ... cause a conviction,” Mr. McKinney said.</p>
<p>Mr. McKinney also asked that Assistant District Attorney Lisa Pellegrini, one of two prosecutors handling the trial, be disqualified because she would potentially be called as a witness.</p>
<p>Deputy District Attorney Kevin Chernosky disputed Mr. McKinney’s characterizations.</p>
<p>“First and foremost, the allegations by Mr. McKinney that anyone from the district attorney’s office or from the Allegheny County Police Department told this witness facts of the case and asked him to get close is an absolute fabrication,” Mr. Chernosky said.</p>
<p>He said the witness waited until the first day of trial to come forward. He called the motion a “distraction” to the case.</p>
<p>“This witness isn’t testifying,” Mr. Chernosky said.</p>
<p>Mr. Chernosky said the witness was designated in 2017 by state Superior Court an “agent of the state” for previous testimony that had been given. The DA’s office needed to decide whether to use the witness in the Wilkinsburg case and ultimately, after six to 10 months of analysis, decided against it.</p>
<p>Mr. Chernosky also termed an “absolute mischaracterization of the facts” a timeline laid out by Mr. McKinney about the witness’ interaction with law enforcement in connection with when homicide charges were filed against Shelton.</p>
<p>He said the witness came forward in April 2016 on the same day that Thomas was jailed. Prosecutors determined that the witness was credible, and county police interviewed him the next day. The relationship apparently soured at some point.</p>
<p>“I’m aware of at least one instance where this witness attempted to make contact with Ms. Pellegrini in this very case and attempted to threaten her,” Mr. Chernosky said. “We need to continue this case without any distraction from a witness who’s not relevant.”</p>
