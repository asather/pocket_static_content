<h1>Locksmith company accuses rival of ‘hijacking’ online customers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Hampton locksmith is accusing an Oakland rival company of “hijacking” its Google business page listing to redirect clients, allegedly costing him hundreds of thousands of dollars in business.</p>
<p>A-1 Rudy Lock &amp; Safe, owned by Robert Tegge, filed the civil complaint this week against M&amp;N Locksmith Co. including claims for tortious interference and unfair competition, alleging that M&amp;N has created confusion in the marketplace.</p>
<p>The lawsuit in Allegheny Common Pleas Court seeks damages, as well as a permanent injunction against the defendant that would prohibit M&amp;N from using A-1's name, phone number and business listing, as well as prohibit M&amp;N from diverting business from A-1.</p>
<p>Matan Yosef, listed as the founder of M&amp;N on its website, did not want to comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Tegge referred a call to his attorney. She did not return a call seeking comment.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, A-1 has experienced a decline in customers generated through its local online listing since 2017. When the company investigated, it found that the phone number on the Google local listing was incorrect.</p>
<p>"Sometime in 2019, A-1 discovered that the incorrect local listing had not been a harmless error, but a deliberate act by one if its competitors in the Pittsburgh area to hijack A-1's local listing and trick potential customers into thinking they would be contracting with A-1 for locksmith services,” the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>The company only found out, it continued, when a dissatisfied customer who thought they had hired A-1 called to complain and realized they did had not done business with A-1.</p>
<p>On Nov. 26, the lawsuit said, Google was able to ensure to A-1 that the phone number on its business listing was accurate. But around the same time, A-1 got another call from a customer who thought she had hired A-1.</p>
<p>When a locksmith was at her home, the complaint said, he charged her for additional, unsolicited services.</p>
<p>“After searching for A-1's website specifically, she realized she had not contacted A-1 at all,” the complaint said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She then reached out to A-1 and was able to provide her canceled check for the services, which she had made payable to M&amp;N.</p>
<p>"M&amp;N, by hijacking A-1's local listing, has been illicitly diverting business away from A-1 for several years and tricking A-1's potential customers into paying a party that the customer never intended to contact for locksmith services."</p>
<p>"The act of hijacking a competitor locksmith's local listing has plagued the locksmith industry for many years.”</p>
<p>Tom Demont, the former president of the Associated Locksmiths of America, could not comment specifically about the two companies involved in the lawsuit, but said that scams like this have been plaguing the industry for 15 years.</p>
<p>“Basically, they’re bait and switch companies,” he said. “It’s tough to catch these guys. They’re here one day and gone the next.”</p>
<p>One of the techniques that is used, Mr. Demont said, is that the questionable company will hack the website of another, and when a customer clicks on the phone number to call for service, they are redirected to a different company.</p>
<p>“Most of them are not locksmiths,” he said. “They come out and destroy your lock so they can put on a new one.”</p>
<p>Mr. Demont, who operates a locksmith distribution company in Finleyville, said he’s seen bills as high as $1,200.</p>
<p>“It’s really bad, and there’s nothing you can do about it,” he said.</p>
