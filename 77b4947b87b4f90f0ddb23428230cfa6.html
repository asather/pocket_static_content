<h1>Penguins return to Pittsburgh awaiting further instruction from NHL</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the Penguins touched down in Pittsburgh on Thursday afternoon, their flight landing less than two hours after the NHL announced it was suspending its season as the COVID-19 pandemic shook America, the Penguins knew about as much as we did about what the future would hold in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>A day later, the Penguins still didn’t have many answers. The news of the NHL and other leagues shutting down, hopefully on a temporary basis, came in waves on Wednesday and Thursday, while they watched on from a Columbus hotel.</p>
<p>The league, in conjunction with the NHL Players Association, is still figuring out the next steps for teams. It could take a few days for an official decree. So the Penguins remain in a holding pattern, waiting to follow the NHL’s lead.</p>
<p>Obviously, the organization at the moment is mostly concerned about the health of players, coaches and other team employees. When the team plane landed Thursday, no one among the traveling party showed any symptoms of the new coronavirus. No tests were administered. Nobody needed to be quarantined.</p>
<p>That remained the case Friday morning, according to a team source.</p>
<p>The league has stated that there will be no mandatory testing for all players. If one shows symptoms of COVID-19, a test will be administered as appropriate.</p>
<p>“We will continue to monitor all the appropriate medical advice, and we will encourage our players and other members of the NHL community to take all reasonable precautions — including by self-quarantine, where appropriate,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said Thursday afternoon in a statement.</p>
<p>The Penguins told their players upon their arrival back in Pittsburgh to go home to their places of residence in the area to await word on what happens next.</p>
<p>NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly told TSN on Friday morning that “the general expectation is that players will remain in their club’s home cities absent unusual circumstances.” But Daly said if a player is separated from his family because his permanent home is elsewhere, he “should be permitted” to go there.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, the Penguins, who since the start of February have acquired four new players via trade, were trying to sort out such logistics with players.</p>
<p>Teams are allowed to communicate with their players. But Daly said the NHL is “recommending against informal skates during this initial phase of the pause.”</p>
<p>“We envision there coming a time where we transition direction from ‘stay at home’ to opening club facilities to players to work out and to skate on a voluntary basis in small groups — similar to what we generally see [before] team training camps,” said Daly, who didn’t put a timeline on when that might happen.</p>
<p>Daly, talking to TSN, added: “We will see how the next week or so plays out.”</p>
<p>Daly did say that once a player begins “training for the resumption of play,” his activities will be subject to provisions in his standard player contract.</p>
<p>UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, the team’s practice facility in Cranberry, was closed to the public Thursday and will stay shuttered through Sunday. Facility staff said “in the near future” information will be provided about next week.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the team will be permitted to do there in the coming days.</p>
<p>On Thursday, as the Penguins waited in Columbus to see if that night’s game against the Blue Jackets was still on, the league announced that the suspension of the season would begin immediately, with the hopes of eventually resuming it.</p>
<p>That news came a day after the NBA suspended its season “until further notice” after the first instance of a player testing positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>In addition to the suspension of those leagues, the NCAA canceled its remaining winter and spring championships, MLB pushed back the start of spring training and the Masters golf tournament and Boston Marathon were postponed.</p>
<p>The NHL has not publicly stated how long the suspension will last. But the NBA, perhaps the most progressive of North American professional sports leagues, will take a hiatus of “at least” 30 days, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said.</p>
<p>Just twice since 1915 has the Stanley Cup not been awarded. In 1919, the finals were canceled after five games after the Spanish flu hospitalized many Montreal Canadiens players and claimed the life of one player. And the Cup was not claimed in 2005 after that season was canceled due to a labor lockout.</p>
<p>The Penguins, who have played 69 of 82 games, sit third in the Metropolitan Division standings behind the Washington Capitals and the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
