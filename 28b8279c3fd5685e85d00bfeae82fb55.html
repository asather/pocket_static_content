<h1>Employee at county jail diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An employee at the Allegheny County Jail was diagnosed Wednesday with Legionnaires’ disease, days after a county&nbsp;Department of Human Services worker&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/02/25/Legionnaires-case-prompts-cautious-county-to-test-water/stories/202002250116" target="_blank">contracted the disease</a>, the county health department said.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that the cases are related since the jail and the downtown building the DHS employee worked at have two different water systems, the health department said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Allegheny County leadership has asked ACHD to investigate and test the water at ACJ out of an abundance of caution,” the Wednesday statement read. “Typically there is not a Health Department investigation or review unless two cases have been reported related to the same source.”</p>
<p>The investigation is underway, and has so far determined that there is no Legionella — the disease that causes Legionnaires’ — at the jail. Water samples were collected Wednesday; results are usually returned in 10 days, according to the health department.</p>
<p>Legionnaires’ disease can be fatal, but deaths from the disease typically only occur with elderly or people with weakened compromised systems.</p>
