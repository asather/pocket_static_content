<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 10.08.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Let’s get started!!</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Z. South Side</strong>: Hey paul. Was the return enough for Murr? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Given the market for goalies yes. I think Jim Rutherford got as much as he could out of that trade</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Z. South Side</strong>: I was shocked those 'people ' to be nice we're speaking to you the way they did yesterday in the mailbag. Saying you have an agenda against Pitt and the Steelers? Unbelievable people read these sports pages and still not get how it works or how you all do your jobs. Sad. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Here is what 25 years of being in the news business has taught me - fan boys are delusional and you should not take what they say personally. Fans are rational and I have wonderful conversations with them all the time and enjoy chats and things of the such. Fan boys - who are so irrational in their love for teams/players/political parties that they are emotional and can’t have a rational conversation are just amusing because we can all make fun of them for being so ridiculous</p>
<p><strong>Buzz</strong>: Any chance the NFL could/would change the date of that Titans game? that scheduling gave the Steelers a Murder's Row to deal with. Seems like they are being punished and they did nothing wrong! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They can be punished with draft choices being docked, fines, some player suspensions but the NFL isn’t concerned about making the Steelers schedule easier. That’s not on their minds nor should it be</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Z. South Side</strong>: So can we expect the Steelers to play like they feel some kinda way about their perceived slight? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: What is the perceived slight? What am I missing?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Z. South Side</strong>: Lebron and the Boys are bringing the title to tinseltown tonight. How do you feel about that Paul? <br> <strong>Jimmie</strong>: What will it take to resign Bud Dupree? Will the Steelers sign him? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Jeff - this was a bad year for the NBA, a really bad year. Too many top players hurt or not playing. Too many mediocre teams.Bad atmosphere in the buildings. The best part of the Lakers winning the title is it will put thi <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: s season out of its misery! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Jimmie - the way Dupree is playing he is pricing himself out of Pittsburgh. He is going to command a huge number and the Steelers probably won’t be able to fit him under their cap</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Can Pitt Fb get to the 'next level'? What is the realistic 'next level' ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes. But they can’t if they keep losing to teams like NC State at home. I think it is realistic to be a team that gets to ten wins most years, a bad year is 8 and a really good year ends up in the ACC title game. Pitt isn’t really that far from there, well again they need to stop losing bad games to bad teams</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Has Jim Rutherford bungled any remaining window for Sid and Geno and should he have been fired? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes unfortunately I think he has. The Penguins are not good enough to win a Stanley Cup as constituted and I don’t think they have the cap space and young talent to get measurably better in the next few years</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: Hey Paul, what are your thoughts on the Murray trade and the Pens draft choices? Thank you . <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I had Dan Kingerski from Pittsburgh Hockey Now on the show the other day. Between what he said and reading what our Post Gazette hockey coverage team has written it seems like they have drafted well and got good value from their picks. It is strange the emphasis on goalies but then again depth at that position is extremely important</p>
<p><strong>Jimmie</strong>: Is there any reason why #7 won't play into his forties like Brady has? Since the offense has so much potential, as you have indicated, why not play on beyond this contract? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think he might play beyond this contract if his body holds up. That’s the key with any aging player - can they physically keep playing. If he has two good seasons I think he will play again for another year or two. The other question is always - when does his contract/cap hit become too much given his level of play. I would sat at this point he is year to year</p>
<p><strong>Timmy Colorado Springs</strong>: On a scale from one to "White House Rose Garden" how bad do you think it was to play the Patriots Chiefs MNF game. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It was fine. I mean, I suppose if there is a massive breakout it will he looked at as a bad decision. By so far that hasn’t happened</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Should the NFL shut down for 2 weeks..? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No. The NFL should push forward, learn from mistakes, keep being vigilant and handle issues as they arrive</p>
<p><strong>Southside Jimmy</strong>: Hi Paul. It seems to me the Pitt football players shouldn’t be complaining about not getting rankings respect when for the most part, they don’t beat the teams they’re suppose to defeat easily. Do you agree? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I’ve said it many times - Pitt has never understood that rankings and respect come from winning and winning consistently. Go win games and the rankings will follow</p>
<p><strong>Debbie</strong>: Have you heard if Jim R. will be trying to sign any free agents? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes it sounds like he is going to be looking for some cost effective veterans. A wing and a defenseman</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Thanks for the chats. You don't hear of this much so I thought I would ask. Can NHL teams restructure deals to create more cap space like the NFL? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes, they can also buy out contracts which is obviously what happened in the case of Jack Johnson</p>
<p><strong>Often Cranky Old Guy</strong>: What sort of reactions have you been hearing to the expanded baseball playoffs and what has yours been? I think of myself as mostly a baseball traditionalist and was lukewarm to the idea but I have to say, last week when all of those first round games were going on was pretty cool. It felt kind of like the opening days of the NCAA basketball tournament. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think unlike the NBA, these MLB playoffs have been excellent. Really. I’ve enjoyed them and I like the format a lot. I hope this is something they revisit and talk about when the next CBA talks come about</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Guess i dont buy into the bellyaching about not getting a forfeit. yes, we need everyone to be diligent and all it takes is one person out of 100+. Just a slippery slope to start complaining about positive tests when we have a long way to go in this season and this Covid mess <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The forfeit stuff from Steelers fans/media guys is silly. The forfeit wasn’t put on the table as an option until after the fact. You can’t retroactively punish teams using punishments that weren’t in place when they broke protocols</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: If NFL games get cancelled would it be more fair to start tracking statistics per game rather than for the whole season? The leader in sacks for the whole season maybe played one more game, and least points allowed on defense maybe played one less game, etc <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They already do that in some categories actually</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Have you watched Terry Bradshaw’s show? If so, what did you think? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No, I’m aging and already have to worry about losing brain cells daily....</p>
<p><strong>Often Cranky Old Guy</strong>: I'll second your comment about putting this NBA season out of its misery and that comes from someone who is really glad they resumed play and will have a champion. But it's just dragged on way too long. They should have shortened early play off series, maybe had fewer seeding games. I can't imagine many people are still watching unless they're Miami or LA fans. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I love the NBA. It is a tremendous league. This has not been a great season for it</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: What’s your take so far on the OL and the running game after 3 games? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Both need to improve for both Pitt and the Steelers. I think having Chuks Okorafor settle in and David DeCastro getting healthy are great developments for the offensive line</p>
<p><strong>Diego</strong>: Happy National Pierogi Day! I was really disappointed with Pitt’s loss to NC State. Is this a case of the players being overconfident, or the the coaches not having the team prepared and motivated or both? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It was a total failure at all levels. I don’t think they were overconfident but I do think they spent the week talking about respect and rankings and all that and forgot to play the game</p>
<p><strong>Dave Hart's Ghost</strong>: But do you have any ideas as to how Pitt stops losing games to had teams? It's almost a characteristic now. Changing coaches hasn't solved it so do you just ride Narduzzi for ages? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It is ridiculous m <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Changing coaches hasn’t changed it. The program is at least stable now so ride it out and hope this staff figures out how to have a breakthrough of some sort</p>
<p><strong>Rick</strong>: Hey Paul! Still have that Florida State helmet you got from me? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes it is somewhere at the house</p>
<p><strong>Joey D.</strong>: Paul, if you’re Cherington or Shelton, what do you do with Trevor Willisms? He has talent, but can’t seem to avoid giving up home runs. Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think you give him a chance to come back next year in spring training. But he can’t be promised a spot in the rotation, he has to earn it. He has some talent so you can’t just give up on him</p>
<p><strong>Hogan</strong>: So your colleague Jerry says he can’t fade it into a right pin from the fairway. I’m thinking you could offer some tips on a banana ball peeling from left to right? Perhaps unintentionally? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Not with an iron. My irons go left. When my drive isn’t working it goes left to right but I wouldn’t be hitting at a pin with my driver</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: Hi Paul. If this season goes like past Pitt seasons. Pitt will pull a big upset sometime this season. Which current top ten team do you think it will happen for Pitt..Clemson, Miami or ND? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would say Miami or ND though I think Miami is a little better than people think they are</p>
<p><strong>Gerala for President</strong>: Hey Paul this new Pirates International signing. Do we know does he have felony convictions like most of their other signees or is it just mostly misdemeanors ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Sigh. Be nice!!!</p>
<p><strong>ctaylor</strong>: Paul, How long does Connor stay healthy this year? 6 games? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I have no idea. With a player like him you just hope all of his injury stuff is behind and he can stay healthy for the season</p>
<p><strong>Carl</strong>: Hi Paul, enjoy your work. Who are some of your favorite sports writers, past or present? Thank you. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: a really good friend of mine, Michael Holley, is in TV now but he is one of the most talented writers I know regardless of the subject. I’ve written before that Bob Smizik is one the great sports columnists and I mean in the country. And people don’t realize he was a tremendous baseball writer. Michael Wilbon was amazing when he was writing for a living. William Rhoden was tremendous until he took this turn to be Mr Woke in the last 15 years. I always thought Mike Wise wrote insightful and great stuff. Phil Jasner in Philly was really good back in the day. Bill Plasche is excellent. Gene Collier is extremely talented writer I enjoy reading as well.</p>
<p><strong>John angle Jinglehimmer</strong>: Paul what do you think about getting the San Diego Chicken to moderate one of the Presidential debates ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It can’t be worse than the two who have moderated these last two debates, can it?</p>
<p><strong>Love the Show</strong>: I saw on CBS Sportsline the other day their Bowl projection guru doesn't have Pitt going to ANY bowl. Seem a little harsh or are they correct ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think it is a product of there being less bowls right? A few aren’t gonna happen. Pitt will get to a bowl game if it takes care of business</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Follow on to my previous question about the NHL cap...if they can do it why dont they do with Sid Geno and Letang contracts? If the time is now and we don't have cap space they should do everything to create cap space. What am I missing because you are correct this current team will not compete for the cup <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Aren’t both of those contracts already rather team friendly given the market and what players are making these days?</p>
<p><strong>Love the Show</strong>: Where do you think Bill O'Brien ends up ? Pro or College ? HS ? Out of coaching altogether ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: He will be an offensive coordinator again in the NFL. I don’t see him getting another shot at head coach unless he is willing to not have full control. He was a terrible general manager</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Sports writers? What a stupid question <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Imagine being so angry and miserable of a human that you log in to a chat to complain about a question that someone asked. We live in a bizarre world these days. It ain’t that serious, enjoy the ride my man! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Any more questions before I go?</p>
<p><strong>Love the Show</strong>: Pirates never break .500 again. Ever. Agreed ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I do not. A broken clock is right twice a day and even a blind squirrel finds the acorn from time to time. It will happen. I don’t know when but it will happej</p>
<p><strong>Jack splat</strong>: Last year Steelers were 0-3, now they’re 3-0. Just saying and enjoying the ride. Thanks! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: One would much rather be 3-0 indeed and as Ive said I don’t think the offense has hit its stride yet</p>
<p><strong>TPhunter</strong>: Paul, I watched the NC State-Pitt game and honestly didn't see why NC State was such a big underdog. They looked evenly matched to me. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: NC State hasn’t been very good this year and they have had some QB issues. Pitt is supposed to be this more experienced and established team. I would be willing to bet if you did player for player based on recruiting rankings the two teams are far more similar than not</p>
<p><strong>Chaos is My Name</strong>: Think Nutting gets busted for tax fraud or cooking the books this off season ? His trial would draw good ratings for AT&amp; T sPORTS <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I’m gonna go out on a limb and say no.....</p>
<p><strong>Its Your fault</strong>: Was that one of the worst officiated college games you ever saw at Heinz Field last week ? I'd say so <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think there were a lot of tough calls on interference. I don’t know that they were bad or incorrect. I know Pitt fans feel like they got jobbed a little but but I just don’t see it <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: OK well we had fun but now we need to move on. Thanks for all the great questions and let’s do it again next week!</p>
