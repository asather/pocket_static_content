<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 04.13.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi, everybody. Welcome to our second-to-last pre-draft chat. We'll be chatting/writing/podcasting a whole bunch next week, too. For now, your finest questions, please.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Sunner in Orlando</strong>: Hey Brian! Some commentators were talking about the Steelers trading back into the first round in order to pick Jordan Love. Do you "love" the idea or are the talking heads running out of material? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't even like it, let alone love it. Even if the draft capital-strapped Steelers could pull off a trade to get back into the first, I think they'd want to do it for an even better shot at one of the best playmakers in this class. But I have noticed Jordan Love getting a ton of buzz lately. One of those late-rising type prospects who will make Draft Day a little more fun.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Steelers signed 6th XFL player, way more than most. Is this because they have only 6 picks or do they want players with some experience with shortened offseason possibly? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Some of both. They shook the tree for a bunch of AAF guys this time last year, too, and kept most of them around for training camp. I think they probably see some value in kicking the tires on productive guys from spring football leagues, and they might've been prospects that they've liked (relatively speaking) for a long time. Saeed Blacknall from Penn State is the latest one, a 6-3 receiver who can fly but was never all that productive in college. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I shouldn't say he can fly. That's inaccurate. He can run fast.</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: Will there ever be a Spring football league again ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I won't rule it out. From the sounds of it, the XFL was doing a lot of things right and seemed pretty committed to continuing until COVID-19 hit.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong>: Do you think the Steelers should take a RB in the 2nd or 3rd or not at all? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Personally, I don't think they should take one. If I were calling the shots, I'd probably use my six picks on a receiver first, then an offensive lineman, inside linebacker, safety, edge rusher and defensive lineman, though not necessarily in that order.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Hey Brian, as far as I know, the Hall of Fame game between the Steelers and Cryboys is still scheduled to be played. Have you heard if the corresponding induction ceremony is still on? I would think there would be a high number of Steelers fans who would like to be in Canton but may be unable to to so because of the pandemic travel restrictions? Thank you. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The NFL hasn't announced any update on that yet. Whether it's training camps, the games themselves or something like the induction ceremony, I assume the league is going to hold out as long as possible before making any major postponement/cancellation decisions.</p>
<p><strong>DaquidoBazzini</strong>: What would it take for the Steelers to move up a bit higher in the 3rd Round? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Something like their third-round comp pick plus a future third. Or maybe a package of the comp pick, one of this year's fourths and this year's sixth? I wouldn't bet on it.</p>
<p><strong>Dionte Johnson</strong>: Will I have 1,000 yards receiving and 10 TDs? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That's a steep prediction, Diontae. The guess here is no, with the thinking that the receiving stats will be a bit more spread around.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck</strong>: Trying to remember history. Was there some debate about drafting QB Ben? I vaguely remember Cowher wanting to draft immediate defensive help instead of a QB that would take time to develop. Or am I misremembering? Comes to mind because of the debate whether to draft immediate help this year, or a QB if one drops. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Your memory only partially deceives you, Chuck. The Steelers did indeed almost pass on Ben, but it wasn't for defensive help. They were looking long and hard at Arkansas OL Shawn Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>chuck Mac</strong>: If we cannot go to St Vincent, is it a done deal that we go to South side for camp? This seems nearly unmanageable with that many players and many of them not having homes or living quarters. What scenario do you see playing out? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, I think it'd be camp on the South Side. They'd make it work. Pitt has its version of training camp there every August and puts up players in a hotel down the street. The Steelers could certainly do something similar for those who don't have their own places in the area. At this point, while I'm no infectious disease expert, I'd put my money on no Saint Vincent for camp.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Hi Brian. Please answer me this: what’s up with some of the national and local sports guys dyeing their hair? Are they being told to do this or is it a personal choice? Thanks! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi Donna, I must be honest this question came out of left field. I don't know how to answer it or what to tell you. But as a "local sports guy" whose beard renders him basically unrecognizable from his Post-Gazette mug shot, I have no room to talk.</p>
<p><strong>Y-town Steeler</strong>: What up BB? Hope you're staying safe. Today is my son's Drew's birthday. Can you give him a shout out? GO STEELERS!!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I've got love for Youngstown, and I've got love for young Drew. Happy birthday, my man. One day off from the coveted "412" birthday, which is shared by my twin cousins, my friend Greg and my college roommate.</p>
<p><strong>Big Bri</strong>: What do you think about adding a 2nd bye week with a 17th game schedule? Seems like a win win, NFL gets an additional week of TV revenue and players get another week to recover. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Fine with me. When I covered college football, Pitt only had one off week. Last year was my first season covering the Steelers, who, obviously, had only one off week. But 2019 was the first time in a while in college football that every team had two off weeks. Unlucky me.</p>
<p><strong>KK</strong>: Spring football is a failure and always will be. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Your complaint is noted and logged.</p>
<p><strong>Melody</strong>: Let’s say is WR at 49 BPA these 5 players are available (none might we know) but if how would you rank them Brian for us in your gut : Mims, Shenault, Aiyuk, Claypool and Reagor.. (all healthy enough let’s think) I will be very happy with any of those, Thanks.. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'd go Denzel Mims, Chase Claypool, Jalen Reagor, Laviska Shenault, Brandon Aiyuk. To be clear, that's my ranking in terms of how much each one could help the Steelers. Just think Shenault and Aiyuk would be sort of overlapping pieces with what the Steelers already have. The other three have 4.4. type speed.</p>
<p><strong>fredward</strong>: Any insight on this new receiver the Steelers signed today? Slot guy, speed guy? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Definitely a speed guy, fredward. Saeed Blacknall ran a 4.39 coming out of Penn State but went undrafted. Never had more than 347 yards receiving or three touchdowns in a season with the Nittany Lions, but averaged a staggering 19.6 yards per catch. I'm guessing the Steelers envision some Johnny Holton-like special teams potential if nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>Patty</strong>: I still think we need to pick up another QB just in case Ben goes down and I am not sure Mason Rudolph can get the job done. What about Andy Dalton? For awhile in Cincinnati he a great group of receivers, but I think bad coaching led to the breakdown of that team. I think he would be a good fit in our offense! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Andy Dalton isn't a free agent like Jameis Winston and Cam Newton, so the Steelers would either have to trade for him or see if the Bengals cut him after presumably drafting a QB. He'd almost certainly be an upgrade over Rudolph, but overall ... meh.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Hi Brian - What is the biggest surprise move or non-move this offseason roster-wise? What are the top two paths you think the Steelers have in mind to bolster LB position? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hmm I'd say signing Eric Ebron was the biggest surprise. As for non-moves, no real surprises. I think they'll look to the draft for LB help and if things don't pan out in terms of the prospects available, there's always street free agents once again. But maybe they can find a guy who has enough versatility to develop into an edge-rusher or off-ball linebacker. They thought they might have that with Sutton Smith last year. Remember him?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: Of the players drafted over the past two years, who do you see making the biggest leap in 2020. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Can I give you one on offense and one on defense? I can see Jaylen Samuels bouncing back with Ben Roethlisberger under center again. On defense, I'll go with Ulysees Gilbert as a guy who will show flashes of being able to help at linebacker.</p>
<p><strong>Krugerrand</strong>: 6 XFL players signed by the Steelers: WR Saeed Blacknall, DL Cavon Walker, OL Jarron Jones, S Tyree Kinnel, LS/LB Christian Kuntz, and DE Dewayne Hendrix. How many of these have a chance to make the team? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Let's give the edge to the linemen. Those two position groups both lost starters in the offseason, so there's opportunity there. It'll depend on what they end up with in the draft, but Walker and Jones are the most intriguing to me.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: Using Zoom so much for work, and hearing about the security flaws. Knowing some teams reputation, how will the virtual draft communications happen for everyone in a secure manner? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: If someone joins your chat with the name WickedSmahtFootballGuy boot them out right away.</p>
<p><strong>schnail</strong>: Are we likely to see a lot more of Vince Williams on the field again at ILB this season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: At this point, I must say yes. He's most helpful against teams like the Browns, Ravens and Bills, all of whom are on the schedule again in 2020. Not to mention the Titans, Jaguars and Colts, all teams that are more than likely going to want to run the ball a lot next season.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: (no need to post this, lol) I think red delicious apples are the best, Brian. Your wife should let you off the hook for that one. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Jacque is referencing our last North Shore Drive podcast, specifically my story of going grocery shopping for the family last week and managing to get my wife the only kind of apple she DOESN'T like. I mean, come on. "Delicious" is right in the name. But I'm pleased to tell you we've since made a trade with my in-laws, swapping 5 red delicious for 5 honeycrisp and toilet paper considerations.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Do you think the Steelers will draft another OL player with their top 3 picks? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yes but I think it's an interesting discussion whether they should go tackle or guard. In fact, Ray Fittipaldo and I discussed it on that very same podcast. We also played a game at the end that included random trivia questions about Zach Banner and Duck Hodges, so check it out if you haven't<br> <br> <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/10/pittsburgh-steelers-draft-podcast-ben-roethlisberger-mason-rudolph-jacob-eason/stories/202004100138" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/10/pittsburgh-ste...</a></p>
<p><strong>VAsteelersFan</strong>: Hey BB . . . Kirk Herbstriet is predicting no football this season. Would that result in a unprecedented gap with respect to talent appraisal and player development down the pipeline? Like, say, the 2021 draft and basically any college player hoping to make it to the NFL. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It really would. You'd have to go opposite of this offseason and do a TON of pre-draft evaluation stuff for those prospects. Combines, pro days, visits, the works.</p>
<p><strong>Yo</strong>: Shenault is gonna be a beast <br> <strong>Yo</strong>: Shenault ran with a hernia 4.55 ish <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That's a lot faster than I could run without a hernia.</p>
<p><strong>Scuba Steve</strong>: I’m of the mindset that Ozark should have only been on the air for 11 minutes because Marty Byrde should have been “offed” when his co-workers were 86ed. Those were some of the most incompetent cartel hitmen of all-time. Your thoughts BB? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Actually my wife and I are only three episodes into Ozark. You're right that the opening episode undoubtedly stretched the imagination a bit, but I like the show just fine and am going to keep watching. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: OK everyone, my apologies but I have to cut the chat eight minutes short. I do have a good excuse, though. My wife is back at work from maternity leave starting today, so I'm on daddy daycare duty at home and my son is squirming. Tip of the cap to her and all others working in the healthcare field out there. An extra tip of the cap to all of you for chatting.</p>
