<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 07.06.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hey there, trusty chatters. Thanks for stopping by. Although you all might be the ones catching me up after spending last week golfing (poorly), sitting on a beach and enjoying precious time with family. Let's go.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Hi Brian your thoughts on no preseason games good or bad? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Mostly good. Players don't like them and neither do fans. If there were ever a year to see what football would be like without them, this is it.</p>
<p><strong>THomas</strong>: Juju, DJ, James and Claypool....who has the inside track to WR5? Please dont say Switzer. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ryan S.</p>
<p><strong>Bigedbarr71</strong>: Hey Brian! Hope all is well with you &amp; the family! So what's your gut telling you? NFL for 2020? Yes or no? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: My gut's telling me yes, Big Ed. All is well here.</p>
<p><strong>Turk in MD</strong>: Hi Brian. Hope you had a great holiday weekend. ILB and NT are the notable areas the team is thin (meaning there’s no consensus starter on the roster). Is there another position group where you think the team is thin and how severe compared to ILB and NT? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Safety. To me, it's just as thin as nose tackle. There's no clear next man up behind Minkah Fitzpatrick and Terrell Edmunds, same situation as last year when Kam Kelly had to rise up out of the AAF to start Week 1.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Watched You Tube video of all Ben’s 2018 TDs. AB made some ridiculous catches. Suddenly worried he cannot really be replaced? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It's not a sudden worry. But it is a question we only sort of got answers to last year. The receiving group fell off a lot, clearly, but it's a bit unfair to judge them without Ben Roethlisberger.</p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: How would you handle an Orlando pride situation where a team has a high number of Covid positives? Forfeit the game or reschedule and keep prolonging the season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: You're talking about the team that pulled out of the National Women's Soccer League after having 10 positive tests. I certainly don't think an NFL team would withdraw from the season. A forfeit is also tough to imagine. In this scenario, I guess you could just follow the league policies for "close contact" with positive individuals, which includes daily testing. And, obviously, remove any other positives from the team for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>Ryno</strong>: Would it shock you if there is some type of virus-related disaster on at least one team if they do a 2020 season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Depends what you'd consider a disaster. Given the amount of testing, I could see an outbreak within an organization, sure. But as far as a bunch of players getting sick and/or needing hospitalized? That would shock me.</p>
<p><strong>Tampa Too</strong>: Brian thank you for the chat. I see the positive testing for COVID 19 that is occurring with other sports. Even golf which social distances is having players come down with the virus. I think it’s going to be difficult for football to be played this year because if one player on the team comes down with the virus the entire team may need to be quarantined. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well, the NFL and NFLPA are already working on protocols to avoid a large-scale quarantine. It mostly hinges on immediate testing for those in contact with anyone who tests positive, and then increased monitoring of symptoms plus daily testing for a week thereafter. It's gonna be a tricky situation, no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic</strong>: Good Afternoon Brian, is there any truth to possible interest by Baltimore in acquiring Antonio Brown? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't know, but I still wouldn't bet on him playing in the NFL again, despite how quiet he's been lately.</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville</strong>: Good morning. Living here in Nashville, <br> <strong>Alan in Nashville</strong>: people are already planning parking lot parties downtown during Titans games and I’ve already been invited to several for when the Steelers visit. Do you think the cities or the league will crack down on these things? We’re supposed to be IN the stadium but I know that if fans can’t be, many will resort to other gatherings, possibly defeating the purpose? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It'll depend on the local government in each state, I'd assume, and what the restrictions are once the season starts. For what it's worth, it'll probably be a bad look for any place where something like that does occur. Doubt there's anything the league could do about it, though.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: You get $100 million if you are correct. There will not be a complete 2020 NFL football season. True or false? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Uh, to me, the preseason is part of the 2020 NFL football season, so I'll say true and take my $100 million. Nice knowing yinz.</p>
<p><strong>ZO</strong>: Hello! Thanks for the chat! Assuming that Juju has a solid bounce back season, what do anticipate the Steelers would most likely course of action would be? Franchise him? Sign him long term? Let him leave via free agency? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sup, ZO. They've been pretty keen on the franchise tag, and rightfully so. It favors the organizations. Probably depends on just how solid a season it would be, but I still think long-term is most likely. Don't feel all that confident about it, though.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: When will we see rookie's signing contracts? Are they guaranteed if no games? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Some teams have already taken care of that, but most haven't, including the Steelers. Not sure when you'll see them get done, but I can't envision the NFLPA letting the rookies get jobbed on deals after spending all offseason in virtual OTAs, minicamp, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: I know this is negative but why don't they just postpone this season? It is highly unlikely that the virus will be controlled by then! I know this would create other issues such as free agency but trying to play in front of no fans and for how long? It will be difficult with no football or any other sport but it just doesn't seem to be worth the chance! What do you feel about this? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Because the NFL doesn't want to lose a season's worth of money. In general, I don't disagree with your point. But I'll leave it up to science to determine whether the risk is worth the reward.</p>
<p><strong>Pitts4Life</strong>: Do you think Ben is still a Top 10 QB in the league? If not, how far has he fallen? Thanks <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Off the top of my head, I'd say no. He's particularly tough to gauge because last time we saw him play a full season, he was really productive. But last time we saw him PLAY, he wasn't. And now he's coming off injury. And other young stars are rising. He's probably juuust outside the top 10 for me.</p>
<p><strong>Dave. Md</strong>: With Brady out of the AFC, do you think the Steelers chances of advancing to and out of the AFC Championship game, have increased substantially? Assuming, everyone stays healthy Throughout the year. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think every team in the AFC's chances have increased with Tom Brady leaving New England. But the Ravens and Chiefs are still head and shoulders above the rest of the conference in my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Buster</strong>: Don’t you think Daniel Snyder should be happy he has a reason to change the Redskins’ name and logo? Teams make minor changes to their uniforms’ color and design all the time in order to boost merchandising sales. This could be a bonanza for Washington. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, he's probably not happy to deal with a controversy that's likely to upset as many people as it satisfies. Such is life. I don't think the fans who are most resistant to the change would rush out to buy the new gear/support the new name.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: If this country is now so divided that it must have two anthems played before a game, why don't we just decide to skip the ritual and get directly into playing the game? That <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Personally, that'd be fine with me.</p>
<p><strong>SteelmanInGeorgia</strong>: Your gut says yes to an NFL season, but mine says the NFL would LOVE to have a valid excuse to cancel the 2020 season and not have to stand behind their position on National Anthem protests for the season, and let it go away quietly, without the weekly exposure and long-term fan ill-will that will result. Then, they come back in 2021 hoping to get credit cheaply, for taking a stand that cost them little. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nah, I think they'd much rather take the money and the firestorm. They might even be uniquely positioned to withstand any fan pushback this year, given how much the country is clamoring for sports amid the pandemic. People will watch.</p>
<p><strong>Mercury</strong>: I disagree with your assertion that Ben is outside of the top ten. If he’s healthy you have Brees, Rodgers, Mahomes, Jackson, maybe still Brady. Maybe Wentz. Who else is better than a healthy Ben? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: First of all, "if he's healthy" is a pretty significant caveat that must be factored into the discussion. You're forgetting Deshaun Watson and Russell Wilson, for sure. Ryan Tannehill might've been a one year wonder, but the advanced metrics loved him last season and he won, so maybe he just needed a change of scenery/new system. And then guys like Dak Prescott, Matt Ryan, Matt Stafford are probably right there on the fringe, as well.</p>
<p><strong>Bob in Texas</strong>: Here is the solution to the National Anthem issue, courtesy of European soccer. Play the anthem, everybody stands. Moment of silence for COVID victims and medical personnel. Then, players take a knee for a moment to support racial justice. Then, play the game. No need to force a choice between honoring your country and supporting racial justice. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thanks Bob, I'll pass it along.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: When someone scores, on TV, you often see a camera guy operating a large camera that appears to float. What is that? How does it appear to float? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That's above my pay grade, but I do appreciate you adding some levity to the chat.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic</strong>: Brian, at Saint Vincent, and correct me if I'm wrong, 3 football fields to practice on. Will the lack of space at Heinz field delay the younger players from getting the necessary reps? Or will they spread practice time out between groups? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Mike Tomlin didn't seem too concerned about that last we spoke with him. He mentioned that Heinz Field has extra space around the actual field itself, so whereas at Saint Vincent you used one of the other fields for drills, you can probably just do that on the periphery now.</p>
<p><strong>fline</strong>: Will Ben be fully recovered, if not will he still start the season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They certainly aren't going to run him out there if he's not 100 percent, if that's what you're asking. And everything appears to be on track with his recovery, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: If the nfl season can’t be completed, what would you do about draft order? Keeping in mind that Trevor Lawrence could be the equivalent of a winning powerball ticket . Thanks - <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't think you could just keep it exactly the same. Probably invoking some sort of lottery system like the other leagues would be best, factoring in 2019 results, 2020 results (if there are any) and where teams got to pick in the most recent draft.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Dumb question but say the cap takes a major hit, like comes down 20%, do the players under contract still get paid the contract or would they too take a 20% hit? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They'll still get paid. It'll be on the teams to manage that, which would be difficult for a lot of front offices and probably necessitate a bunch of tough decisions on high-priced vets.</p>
<p><strong>Ryno</strong>: Do you see any realistic way out of the cap hit Ben will create next season? It is a crippling figure the Steelers have kicked down the road. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sure, cut him. OK, maybe that's not realistic. But they could also extend him again and spread out that money over future years, even ones he might not end up playing.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic</strong>: If I'm Daniel Snyder, I'd calculate all the costs including losses that will be required to change the team name and logo, then submit the the bill to those who want the name changed. When they meet my price, I'll change the name. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think we're out of time. Thanks for all the questions, folks. Have a nice week.</p>
