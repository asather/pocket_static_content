<h1>A NYC startup and Pitt extend an experiment to cut intro course prices</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>College isn't cheap.</p>
<p>But the founder of an online education startup in New York City asserts that he has found a way to deliver high-quality introductory courses at sharply reduced prices.</p>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh, which in the fall put its name behind the experiment, says it is satisfied enough to re-up.</p>
<p>Pitt and the startup, Outlier, announced Tuesday that they will extend into the spring semester and summer a pilot program that debuted in August. Under it, students receive Pitt credits for courses that Outlier designs for delivery anywhere in the United States and beyond with an Internet connection.</p>
<p>The cost for three credits is $400 —&nbsp;closer to community college rates that those of a research university.</p>
<p>Right now, the offerings are limited to Calculus I and Introductory Psychology.</p>
<p>But university and Outlier officials said they will work to add courses that meet Pitt's criteria for awarding credit.</p>
<p>The company touts what it says are cinema-quality lectures by faculty from top-tier campuses including Yale, MIT, Cornell and Columbia universities. There is an interactive textbook, free tutoring and study groups, plus an unusual offer: Refunds to students who do not pass.</p>
<p>The company also asserts that it's ready to maintain academic integrity and thwart cheaters. "We have technology built into our courses that allows us to prevent academic dishonesty and detect it if it occurs," its <a href="https://outlier.org/" target="_blank">website</a> states.</p>
<p>Ambitions in online education come and go.</p>
<p>Like other universities, Pitt has made various efforts to use remote learning to boost educational access, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2013/02/14/Major-universities-seeing-surge-of-interest-in-free-online-classes/stories/201302140529" target="_blank">including Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs.</a> Unlike some of those efforts nationally, this one awards transferrable credit.</p>
<p>Aaron Rasmussen, 36, founder and CEO of Outlier, said he eventually wants to offer online versions of the 25 general education subjects that nationally enroll the most students.</p>
<p>“At a time when millions of people are weighted down by trillions of dollars in student loan debt, it's imperative that creative solutions —&nbsp;even technological ones —&nbsp;are developed to provide young people with viable options for gaining a world class education," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Rasmussen was a <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/" target="_blank">co-founder of MasterClass</a>, a platform through which celebrity lecturers remotely deliver videotaped instruction.</p>
<p>Pitt in recent years has ranked among the nation's most expensive public universities. Of late, it has embarked on <a href="https://www.affordability.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">its own experiments to boost access and control price</a>, said Provost Ann Cudd.</p>
<p>Part-time per-credit rates at Pitt range from $754-$900 per credit for a Pennsylvania resident and between $1,354 and and $1,729 for out-of-state students, Ms. Cudd said.</p>
<p>After checking with leaders of the math and psychology departments, she explained, Pitt decided there was enough merit and course rigor in Outlier's approach to get involved.</p>
<p>Ms. Cudd said it's not just about reaching students in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>"I see this as potentially a national community college, or even an international (one) that's a great opportunity for students who for one reason or another can not access Pittsburgh and the Pitt campus," she said.</p>
<p>Thirty-one students took Outlier's calculus class in the fall and another 28 enrolled in psychology, she said. The share earning Cs or better matched that of students in courses taught face-to-face.</p>
<p>Ms. Cudd met Mr. Rasmussen, a Boston University alumnus, at the time she was a dean on that campus. Mr. Rasmussen, an Oregon native and son of a middle school science teacher, attended BU on Pell grants and cut his costs by taking community college courses, he said. As an entrepreneur, he said that experience grounded him in financial pressures that students face.</p>
<p>Neither party disclosed details of the financial arrangement. Ms. Cudd said Pitt is not losing money on it but also said the university’s goal is not to make a large profit off the teaching experiment.</p>
