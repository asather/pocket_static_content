<h1>Pennsylvania receives $1.5B to supplement unemployment benefits</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania will receive nearly $1.5 billion in federal funding to supplement weekly unemployment benefits, state officials announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>The funds, which are meant to replace the extra $600 in benefits that lapsed in July, will allow the state to provide an additional $300 per week to eligible claimants who are unemployed due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>“The recently ended $600 weekly federal benefit was a true lifeline to many Pennsylvanians,” Jerry Oleksiak, Secretary of the state’s Department of Labor and Industry, said in a prepared statement. “We will get this money into the pockets of the eligible Pennsylvanians who need it.”</p>
<p>State officials, including Mr. Oleksiak and Gov. Tom Wolf, are still pushing Congress to extend the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program, which provided any individual receiving unemployment benefits with an additional $600 per week.</p>
<p>But, “with no Congressional solution anywhere in sight,” Mr. Oleksiak said Pennsylvania wanted to apply for its share of this new program.</p>
<p>The funding, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is part of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/08/08/Trump-extends-unemployment-benefits-defers-payroll-tax/stories/202008080069" target="_blank">temporary federal Lost Wages Assistance program.</a></p>
<p>President Trump pushed the program through with an executive order after talks in Congress over extending unemployment benefit supplements fell apart. Now, the president is seeking to set aside $44 billion in previously approved disaster aid to help states maintain the supplemental jobless benefits.</p>
<p>To qualify for the new program, individuals must self-certify they are unemployed due to the ongoing pandemic and must receive at least $100 in benefits per week through a variety of programs including:</p>
<p>The payments will be made retroactively from August 1, the same week the $600 supplement expired.</p>
<p>The new program will last a minimum of three weeks and will end no later than December 27, 2020, according to a press release.</p>
<p>But in Pennsylvania, eligible recipients will likely receive an additional $300 for about five weeks, Mr. Oleksiak said.</p>
<p>Before workers can see that money, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/08/18/unemployment-benefits-FPUC-extra-300-Pennsylvania-Dept-of-Labor-and-Industry-Trump-executive-order/stories/202008180107" target="_blank">Pennsylvania has to set up a new system</a> to house the program, which must remain separate from the state’s other unemployment systems according to federal guidance.</p>
<p>State officials are laying the groundwork for that new system but are awaiting more instruction from the federal government.</p>
<p>“As we go on, we learn more about it. We might start designing it or talking about it in one way and then we might have to change direction and go another way,” said Susan Dickinson, Director of the Office of Unemployment Compensation Benefits Policy.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of background work that goes into this,” she said. “It's not as easy as just making payments.”</p>
<p>State officials did not have an estimate for when individuals may receive the extra $300 in benefits.</p>
