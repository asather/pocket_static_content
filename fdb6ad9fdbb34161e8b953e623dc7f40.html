<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Misery loves company, and now Gabby Barrett has it on her vengeful breakup hit “I Hope.”</p>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7ySPksJKRpoLlIaE31Yijc" target="_blank">In a new duet</a>, the breakout country star from Munhall shares the verses with Charlie Puth, who topped the charts for 12 weeks with Wiz Khalifa on the blockbuster hit “See You Again.”</p>
<p>The two singers released the track on Friday and will appear together at 1 p.m. on Amazon Live to chat with fans about the collaboration.</p>
<p>“I can’t wait for fans to hear this!,” Barrett, who wrote the platinum single with Zachary Kale and Jon Nite, said in a statement. “With Charlie being on this track, it changes the perspective of the song. When I wrote it I was writing from a woman’s perspective, and so with him being on it, it kind of shows the men’s perspective too. That both sides get cheated on and it’s not just a one-sided thing.”</p>
<p>“I fell in love with the song when I first heard it,” Puth noted, “and to be able to reimagine it with Gabby and the writers and producers and take it to a new place, is really exciting.”</p>
