<p>Two more WPIAL football games have been postponed on opening because of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>The games of South Fayette at Peters Township and Kiski Area at Penn Hills have been called off Sept. 11. Athletic directors at the schools say they hope to reschedule the games later in the season because they are conference games that might make a difference in playoff qualifiers.</p>
<p>The South Fayette-Peters Township game was postponed after Peters Township canceled in-person classes through Friday because of a COVID-19 case and two presumed positive cases in the district. Due to the school shutdown, Peters Township also suspended all sports until Sept. 8. The football game against South Fayette was one of the top matchups in the WPIAL on Sept. 11. Peters Township is the Post-Gazette’s No. 4-ranked WPIAL Class 5A team.</p>
<p>The Kiski Area-Penn Hills game was postponed because a person associated with the Kiski Area football program has been exposed to COVID-19, according to Kiski Area athletic director John Peterman. Kiski Area’s game against Connellsville Sept. 18 also has been canceled and will not be rescheduled because it is a non-conference contest.</p>
<p>“We worked with the department of health on this and we can start back up with football Sept. 10,” Peterman said.</p>
<p>The reason for the postponements this soon is because teams that are shut down for COVID-19 reasons at this time can’t reach the required number of practices before playing the Sept. 11 games. Under PIAA rules, which are followed by the WPIAL, a football team must have five days of heat-acclimatization practices, followed by 10 days of practices, before playing a game.</p>
<p>“This is a learning experience for everyone and we’re just trying to work through this,” Peterman said.</p>
<p>Five games scheduled for the first night of WPIAL football have now been postponed. Baldwin at Mt. Lebanon and Seneca Valley at North Allegheny were both postponed because of COVID-19 cases at Mt. Lebanon and Seneca Valley. Their teams couldn’t get the required number of practices before Sept. 11.</p>
<p>Summit Academy at Shady Side Academy also was canceled because Summit Academy has elected not to play this fall. Also, Shady Side Academy decided not to play games until later in September.</p>
