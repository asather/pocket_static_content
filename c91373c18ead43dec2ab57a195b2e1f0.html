<h1>Governor says Ohio primary will not be held Tuesday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ohio’s health director was set to order polls closed just hours before they were to open there and in three other states for presidential primaries, the governor said late Monday amid the coronavirus pandemic that has paralyzed the nation.</p>
<p>Gov. Mike DeWine said Health Director Amy Acton would declare a health emergency and order the polls closed for fears of exposing volunteer poll workers — many of them elderly — to the virus.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine said at a news conference earlier in the day that “we don’t know who coming through the line has been infected.” He added, “We should not force people to make this choice, a choice between their health and their constitutional rights and their duties as American citizens.”</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine failed to get a judge to halt the primary Monday evening, even though the governor contended the election results wouldn’t be viewed as legitimate in light of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Officials in Ohio had said as recently as Sunday that they would go forward with primary voting, but Mr. DeWine indicated that they became increasingly worried about the safety of polling sites after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned against gatherings of 50 or more people.</p>
<p>Elections officials in the three other states scheduled to vote on Tuesday — Arizona, Illinois and Florida — said on Monday that they planned to proceed with their elections.</p>
<p>“We are fortunate to have numerous options in Florida to cast our ballots safely and securely,” Laurel Lee, the secretary of state, said at a news conference. She added that more than two million ballots had already been cast through early in-person voting and vote by mail.</p>
<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis added that he was committed to holding the elections, saying, “The fact of the matter is, these things can be done in a way where you’re not going to have crowds.”</p>
<p>In Arizona, the state Democratic Party was seeing huge turnout in the form of early mail-in ballots, said Matt Grodsky, a party spokesman. “We believe that delaying the election would cause undue chaos to this election process,” he said.</p>
<p>Kentucky, by contrast, announced on Monday that it was delaying its primary from May 19 to June 23. The announcement was made by Kentucky’s secretary of state, Michael Adams, in a video statement on Twitter.</p>
<p>“Postponing the primary was not an easy decision, but the Republican secretary of state and Democratic governor agreed, and so do county clerks from both parties,” Mr. Adams said. “My hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election. Even if not, this delay will allow me, the state board of elections and our county clerks time to assess what changes we must make to ensure a successful primary election.”</p>
<p>The proposed new date for the Kentucky primary would fall outside the June 9 deadline set by the Democratic National Committee to hold all nominating contests, and could result in a loss of delegates.</p>
<p>The moves to postpone elections Monday came days after elections officials in Louisiana and then Georgia said they would push back their upcoming primary elections in response to the outbreak. On Friday, Louisiana announced that its April 4 election would be postponed by more than two months, to June 20; Georgia followed suit a day later, saying it would reschedule its March 24 contest for May 19.</p>
<p>In Ohio, Mr. DeWine said that the CDC’s recommendation on Sunday against gatherings of more than 50 people meant that the state could not hold its election and comply.</p>
<p>Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager for former Vice President Joe Biden, said in a statement after Mr. DeWine’s afternoon announcement, “We will follow the guidance offered by state public health officials for how to best ensure their populations are looked after while encouraging participation in our democracy.” Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign declined to comment.</p>
<p>The uncertainty in Ohio added yet another logistical speed bump to a presidential primary that has already been upended by concerns that voting could worsen a public health crisis.</p>
<p>Several other states have said they were changing or considering making changes to their voting processes and procedures in response to the outbreak. Wyoming suspended the in-person portion of its Democratic caucuses, allowing residents to either vote by mail or drop off their ballots at a county polling location instead.</p>
<p>Postponements are highly unusual in American political campaigns, but not entirely unprecedented. States have broad autonomy to shape various aspects of their primary elections, including determining the timing.</p>
