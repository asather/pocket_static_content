<h1>Pirates' Class AAA affiliate will explore name change</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates’ Class AAA affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians, are contemplating a name change, the organization announced Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>“Indianapolis Indians baseball dates back to 1902, and it’s been the organization’s goal to be low-cost family entertainment for all fans in an inclusive environment,” the statement read. “We take this mission very seriously. We also feel strongly about the relationship we have with our fans, community and corporate partners.</p>
<p>“Knowing that the appropriateness of our team name is being questioned, we will be forming a committee to explore it while also gathering community input.”</p>
<p>The Indians say their name is derived from the state of Indiana, which means “Land of the Indians” and the city of Indianapolis, which means “City of Indians.”&nbsp;Class AAA Indianapolis potentially changing its name could mirror something happening with MLB’s Cleveland Indians as well.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, Indians owner Paul Dolan said in a statement that the organization will seek an additional perspective, specifically within the Native American community, about its name and mascot.</p>
<p>Indianapolis has been a Pirates affiliate since 2005. In 2017, the team led Minor League Baseball in attendance, with 641,141 fans attending games at Victory Field in downtown Indianapolis.</p>
<p>The statement does not commit to a name change, but, like Cleveland, simply says the organization plans on listening and learning about whom the name affects.</p>
<p>“We are prepared to collaborate with our community and appropriate stakeholders,” the statement continued. “We understand that our team name has not been endorsed by some but trust they understand the history and respectful context in which it has been used over the years. We are committed to engage, listen and exchange ideas.”</p>
