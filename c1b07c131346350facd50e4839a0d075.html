<h1>Museums rely on grants and donations as patrons remain cautious </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After cautiously opening their doors in late June, many museums are living off of government grants and hoping to welcome more visitors to their sites. With limited capacity and increased safety guidelines, museums are working to offer the public a small slice of life before COVID-19.</p>
<p>Visitors can expect their experience to remain the same since pre-pandemic days, but with added social distancing and mandatory masks. Museums with hands-on activities have kept them in place and stepped up cleaning procedures to compensate for high touch areas. Yet, some people still are feeling wary about stepping into nonessential businesses.</p>
<p>The Carnegie Science Center is operating at 10% capacity since reopening on June 25 though they haven’t reached the threshold, according to the museum’s marketing, public relations and social media manager, Nicole Chynoweth. She said some visitors have been excited to get back to normal, though others are still cautious about being in a public space.</p>
<p>“We’ll be here whenever they’re ready to return,” Ms. Chynoweth said. “We’re constantly reevaluating to make sure we’re making the best possible visit.”</p>
<p>In a visitor survey conducted through the month of July, most visitors reported having a positive experience. With less people roaming the museum, patrons have enjoyed the chance to experience exhibits without crowds and long lines.</p>
<p>Smaller museums in the region are hoping for business to gain some momentum, though.</p>
<p>The Harmony Museum in Harmony, Butler County, reopened on June 23 with a capacity of three to four tours a day. However, Gwen Lutz, the museum’s vice president, said they serve an average of only two to three tours a week.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of people are still cautious. We’ve had some [tours], but certainly not our regular flow of customers,” Ms. Lutz said.</p>
<p>The museum received a large portion of funding through events and rentals before the pandemic, which Ms. Lutz described as “nonexistent” now. They’ve been forced to rely heavily on revenue from tours and the “few” donations they’ve received from the community, she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Lutz said Harmony received a payroll protection grant that prevented their employees from being furloughed. However, the museum has been dipping into their reserve funds to “stay afloat.” Raffles, scavenger hunts and vendors are being planned to help aid the museum during its financial hardship.</p>
<p>“We are hoping that if the pandemic does subside and people are still anxious to get out and do things. … We’re hoping that desire to get out and do something will continue,” Ms. Lutz said. “We are concerned for how long our funds will last.”</p>
<p>The West Overton Museum in Scottdale, Westmoreland County, has been a bit more successful since reopening. Aaron Hollis, the museum’s educational director, said he expected to see “virtually no one” when they opened their doors and was surprised to see a small flow of visitors. Yet, Mr. Hollis said the visitation rate isn’t close to a normal season.</p>
<p>He said a majority of funding for West Overton Village, the historic site where the museum is located, comes from events rather than museum visits. As a venue, he said they have taken “a financial hit,” though the museum hasn’t experienced a significant impact.</p>
<p>Washington County’s Pennsylvania Trolley Museum continued their four-mile trips on historic trolleys on July 2. Scott Becker, the museum’s executive director, said “extreme heat” has made business lackluster on some days, though weather issues are typical every year.</p>
<p>Mr. Becker said the museum has received a majority of funding from grants with some donations streaming in from the local community. Like Harmony, the funds have prevented employees from being furloughed. He added that volunteers have been “eager” to continue work maintaining the trolleys, which are cleaned after every tour.</p>
<p>The Westmoreland Museum of American Art remained closed throughout the past few months, with general public access becoming available on August 5. Anne Kraybill, director and CEO, said the museum utilized its time to prepare the facility and employees for new safety regulations and operations. While they lost some funding, Ms. Kraybill said the time off was necessary.</p>
<p>“It was tough in terms of losing earned income, however we’re fortunate earned income isn’t a huge [revenue source] for us unlike performing arts,” Ms. Kraybill said, citing the museum’s free admission.</p>
<p>Although the museum was closed, Ms. Kraybill said many people chose to renew their memberships for the virtual activities it offered throughout the summer, like pop-up studios and summer camps. Membership actually has exceeded expectations set for the summer from the previous year before the pandemic set in, according to Ms. Kraybill.</p>
<p>Reopening has created some difficulties, though a museum’s official opening may be a little easier in the pandemic. Christine Kroger, director of a children’s museum in Beaver County called Neighborhood North, is planning to open over a three-day period in September. She said the museum is “fortunate” to only be in the developmental phase, with less “overhead”&nbsp;than a fully operating museum, Ms. Kroger believes they avoided a greater financial burden.</p>
<p>The executive board for Neighborhood North has been seeking new ways to utilize the museum to help the community during the pandemic. Ms. Kroger said they are looking to tutor children in their new space when students return to school in the fall, whether they’re virtual or not.</p>
<p>Initially, the board planned a fundraiser for the museum’s official opening, though Ms. Kroger said they chose to eliminate it for the three-day&nbsp;event to make it more accessible to all community members. Fundraisers are a primary source of income for the museum, though Ms. Kroger said they are more concerned with helping the community.</p>
<p>“I feel like it’ll be hopeful to have something open during this time,” Ms. Kroger said.</p>
