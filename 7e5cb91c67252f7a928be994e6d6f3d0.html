<h1>South Park man sentenced 10-20 years for stealing from Upper St. Clair church</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A South Park man was sentenced Tuesday to 10-20 years in prison in connection with the theft of more than $1 million from Westminster Presbyterian Church&nbsp;in Upper St. Clair.</p>
<p>David Earle Reiter, 50, appeared Tuesday before Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey Manning, who also ordered Reiter to pay restitution of $1.22 million. The sentence stems from a non-jury trial in October in which <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/10/16/David-Reiter-pleads-guilty-stealing-Upper-St-Clair-Westminster-Presbyterian-Church/stories/201910160171" target="_blank">Reiter pleaded guilty</a> to receiving stolen property, theft, forgery, access device fraud, tampering with records and unlawful use of a computer.</p>
<p>Reiter was hired as the church administrator in 2001 and was responsible for the churchâ€™s finances, according to Assistant District Attorney Jon Pittman. Prosecutors say Reiter stole the money during a seven-year period.</p>
<p>He also pleaded no contest to conspiring with his wife, Connie Reiter, in the crime.</p>
<p>Ms. Reiter also is charged and is scheduled for trial on Jan. 23.</p>
<p>The missing funds came to light in November 2018, when the treasurer of the church board of directors was checking on an audit.</p>
<p>The treasurer attempted to speak with the man he believed had conducted the audit, but, according to investigators, David Reiter gave the treasurer the number of a prepaid cell phone that Reiter had purchased with church funds and then pretended to be the auditor.</p>
<p>The investigation revealed that Reiter had stolen more than $900,000 from the church account, another $100,000 from the Early Childhood Education Programs, and more than $200,000 from the church Bank of America credit card.</p>
<p>Much of that money was used on personal expenses, Mr. Pittman said at the trial, including trips to Disney World, Cedar Point and Hershey Park, as well as music lessons, sporting goods and baseball school.</p>
