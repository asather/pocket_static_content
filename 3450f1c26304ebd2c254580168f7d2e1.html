<h1>Paul Zeise: Have MLB and its players already done too much harm?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred declared Wednesday that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/10/Rob-Manfred-MLB-baseball-2020/stories/202006100127" target="_blank">“we’re going to play baseball in 2020.”</a></p>
<p>That’s wonderful news, but I hope he, players and owners understand that, to far too many people, it won’t matter.</p>
<p>A month ago we talked about how it would be a total disaster if MLB sat this season out, wow it would be followed by a post-1994 (the season labor strife ended the season in August) backlash. We wondered if it would be a funk from which baseball could never recover given there isn’t a Cal Ripken Ironman streak or a Sammy Sosa-Mark McGwire home run chase on the horizon.&nbsp;Now, the idea that&nbsp;baseball can still save itself from significant backlash is a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Many fans have moved from optimistic to angry to disgust and apathy. The owners made their latest proposal, and it is not much different than their other proposals. They know players have made it clear they won’t play for less than prorated salaries, and yet the latest proposal is for the players to take about 85% of their prorated salaries.</p>
<p>This (paraphrased) summary of sports news over the past few weeks illustrates how MLB and the MLB Players Association have screwed up here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>• The PGA Tour will return on June 10</em></p>
<p><em>• The NHL will begin Phase 2 on June 6 and sets July 10 as a target date for training camps</em></p>
<p><em>• The NBA will start informal workouts in two weeks and training camp July 9</em></p>
<p><em>• The NFL has opened its facilities to coaches and is looking at options for a pre-training camp minicamp</em></p>
<p><em>• College football and basketball players have begun to return to campus and summer work outs have begun</em></p>
<p><em>• NASCAR is racing and the next race will even include some fans</em></p>
<p><em>• Horse racing is underway in a number of states</em></p>
<p><em>• Gov. Tom Wolf says it is OK for high school and youth sports to begin having workouts</em></p>
<p>And then we have this:</p>
<p><em>• [Insert side, either MLB owners or MLBPA] rejects latest proposal from other side because the money doesn’t add up.</em></p>
<p>This has been basically a rinse-and-repeat thing where the other sports have all been making headlines with their plans to return while MLB owners and players are bitching about how to divide a pot of literally billions of dollars.”</p>
<p>It’s clear when you listen to sports talk radio. It’s clear when you read social media. It’s clear when you read columns and stories, even ones that are written by the most ardent of supporters of baseball. This isn’t the year for this kind of labor dispute or bickering over money.</p>
<p>Both sides — owners or players -— are&nbsp;doing real damage to the game.&nbsp;And spare me this idea that one side is evil and the other is noble. Both sides have been extremely short-sighted and silly.</p>
<p>Manfred , MLBPA executive director Tony Clark and Co. need to get in a room and come up with a deal they can both live with and move on. The sooner that happens, the better, because the longer this goes on, the more harm there is to the brand.</p>
