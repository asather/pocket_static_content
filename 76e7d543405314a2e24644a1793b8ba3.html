<h1>2 women sue West Penn Hospital after former employee charged with filming patients</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two women have filed a class-action lawsuit against West Penn Hospital alleging the hospital did not properly train and supervise employees after a former worker was found secretly filming patients undressing.</p>
<p>The lawsuit — filed in the Civil Division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas — charges the hospital with invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence.</p>
<p>The charges are connected to 52-year-old Guy Caley of Canonsburg, a former employee who two weeks ago was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/09/02/Guy-Caley-additional-charges-filming-without-consent-West-Penn-Hospital-bathroom/stories/202009020173" target="_blank">charged more than 80 times</a>&nbsp;after investigators said he used hidden cameras to film patients and co-workers undressing in bathrooms and the procedure rooms.</p>
<p>Mr. Caley filmed 34 female patients while working in the radiology department, according to a criminal complaint. Many of the victims were believed to be cancer patients.</p>
<p>When investigators asked why he would record the videos, Mr. Caley allegedly told police he was “curious” about what he would capture on camera.&nbsp;He also told police he used a camera in a hospital bathroom “several other times in the past” to obtain video and audio of employees and other people.</p>
<p>Attorney Rob Peirce, who is representing the unnamed plaintiffs, said the large number of victims and the amount of time Mr. Caley was able to carry out his alleged crimes demonstrates the hospital failed to manage its employees.</p>
<p>He also said the hospital failed to properly screen its rooms to determine that there were no inappropriate or illegal cameras used to record video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The suit has not yet been certified as a class-action lawsuit and is only intended for victims who were patients or visitors at the hospital, Mr. Peirce said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Representatives for West Penn Hospital did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>
<p>One of the plaintiffs was identified in four separate videos, the complaint filed Wednesday reads. The other woman was identified in&nbsp;“several” of the video recordings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Peirce said he is requesting a jury trial, and hopes a victory in the suit will cause West Penn to change its procedures and protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing in the criminal case against Mr. Caley is set for Oct. 2.</p>
