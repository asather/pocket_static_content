<h1>Park and pray: Ukrainian church holds Easter drive-in service, provides 'necessities of the soul'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On the most important date on the Christian calendar, one Pittsburgh-area congregation met to give thanks Sunday, but did so by holding Mass at a makeshift, drive-in church.</p>
<p>With places of worship shuttered to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus that triggers COVID-19, the Rev. Jason Charron, pastor of Holy Trinity Ukrainian Catholic Church in Carnegie, organized an Easter service at the nearby Holy Trinity Cemetery off Baldwin Road in Collier.</p>
<p>Families stayed inside their cars parked on the cemetery’s paved roads while tuning in to a radio broadcast of Rev. Charron’s liturgy and sermon, which were delivered from a portable outdoor icon stand placed in the cemetery.</p>
<p>About 30 cars were parked in the limited space. The most celebrated part of the Mass, sharing of Holy Communion, could not safely be performed, but a practical solution made possible the continuation of an ancient Ukrainian tradition. As cars exited, Easter baskets of paska bread, kielbasa, eggs and cheese were held out of passenger-side windows. As each car passed, Rev. Charron blessed each basket with a sprinkling of holy water.</p>
<p>“I think it went pretty smoothly, and we were able to serve the needs of God and man,” Rev. Charron said. “They were energized. People were honking their horns in parts of my sermon.”</p>
<p>During difficult times, he said, the church is essential, providing “the intangible qualities necessary for victory, which [are] faith, hope and love.</p>
<p>“We’re respecting the civil law. But we’re also respecting the law of God, and respecting the good of the souls entrusted to me,” he said.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Catholics are loyal to papal authority and Roman Catholic dogma while worshipping under the Byzantine liturgical rite, similar to that used by Eastern Orthodox churches.</p>
<p>In addition to the drive-in Easter service, Holy Trinity, like other houses of worship, is using technology to reach out to the faithful.</p>
<p>“Due to public health concerns with the coronavirus, Divine Liturgy will be livestreamed on our Facebook page every Sunday at 10 a.m. until further notice,” the church’s website states.</p>
<p>In the Byzantine Catholic tradition, the Divine Liturgy is the celebration of the Eucharist commemorating the Last Supper. The weekly Mass is livestreamed on Facebook in English and Ukrainian.</p>
<p>The church remains open for individuals and small groups. Rev. Charron suggested that accommodations are made to protect his congregation’s safety.</p>
<p>“We can’t test God by a flagrant disregard for the safety of others. ... So when people hold services that disregard the health of others, that doesn’t exemplify the love of Christ,” he said. “We need to have a prudent regard for the health of others while not forgetting the rights of God to be worshipped.”</p>
<p>Rev. Charron suggested that creative ministry during the ongoing pandemic is similar, in a way, to the creative practice of religion where worship is banned. His wife, Halyna, he said, was born in what was then the Soviet Union, which suppressed the Ukrainian Catholic Church. She was baptized by a priest who arrived at the family home under cover of night, dressed like a doctor making a house call.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a biological virus they were contending with; it was an ideological one,” Rev. Charron said. “With this current virus, we have to find creative ways to serve the good Lord and help our brothers.”</p>
<p>If exceptions can be made to business closure orders, Rev. Charron said, it’s essential for places of worship to have the same opportunities.</p>
<p>“If GetGo is open for doughnuts and bread, it’s unconscionable the church would be closed to the necessities of the soul,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Bethany Presbyterian Church</strong></p>
<p>In another Easter event, the Bethany Presbyterian Church hosted a sunrise service on Sunday at Melrose Cemetery in Bridgeville.</p>
<p>With tombstones serving as a backdrop, people pulled up in their cars as others — while keeping their social distance — listened from lawn chairs.</p>
<p>The service was led by the Rev. Bill Youmans.</p>
