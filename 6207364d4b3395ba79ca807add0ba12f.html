<p>The 911th Airlift Wing has announced that some of its aircraft will fly over hospitals and areas across Western Pennsylvania on Monday.</p>
<p>Similar to the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/05/19/AHN-Forbes-Hospital-UPMC-Mercy-COVID-19-Pennsylvania-National-Guard-flyover-support-healthcare/stories/202005190108" target="_blank">aerial tributes conducted by the Air National Guard on Tuesday</a>, the Coraopolis-based 911th — part of the Air Force Reserve Command — will fly over the areas as part of the Air Force Salutes program to show appreciation for those supporting COVID-19 response efforts.</p>
<p>“While the flyover will occur on Memorial Day, it is not related to Memorial Day events,” the announcement said. “It is intended to honor first responders and healthcare professionals, as well as to provide some general cheer to the local community during the pandemic.”</p>
