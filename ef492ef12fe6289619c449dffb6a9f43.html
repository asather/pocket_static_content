<h1>Fake check artist gets prison in stolen mail, counterfeiting scheme</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Florida swindler who traveled state-to-state to pass fake checks, including in the Pittsburgh region, was sentenced this week to 41 months in prison and ordered to pay nearly $1 million in restitution.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Marilyn Horan imposed the sentence on Brian Omar Campbell on Tuesday.</p>
<p>His co-conspirator, Calar Braxton, was sentenced to the same term earlier this year.</p>
<p>Both men, from Orlando, had pleaded guilty to conspiring to pass fake bank checks in Robinson and acknowledged they’d done the same in numerous southern states.</p>
<p>Their scheme came undone following an investigation by postal inspectors and police in North Fayette, where they had set up shop at a Residence Inn.</p>
<p>They flew to Pittsburgh in September 2017, rented a room and set about stealing people’s mail in Coraopolis and Imperial. They took the mail back to their room. If it contained a check, they used the account information to make fake checks using a laptop and laser printer.</p>
<p>Then they went shopping, passing the fake checks at the Mall at Robinson and various stores in that area. Prosecutors said the pair targeted national chains with the intention of obtaining cash refunds for stolen items at counterpart stores in other states.</p>
<p>The operation fell apart because a hotel employee found a bag of bank checks outside their room in October 2012 and called police.</p>
<p>Campbell and Braxton also did themselves no favors by smoking in a non-smoking room. Hotel employees entered the room to find evidence of smoking and came across the printer, laptop and a box of blank checks.</p>
<p>Police searched the room and found the items along with checks drawn on SunTrust accounts and issued in the name of Taylor Crimson, one of Braxton’s aliases.</p>
<p>They also found stolen mail from people in Coraopolis and Imperial and other mail stolen from people who live in Orlando.</p>
<p>In addition, officers discovered fake driver’s licenses from southern states in Braxton’s wallet.</p>
<p>Braxton and Campbell admitted as part of their pleas that they had pulled the same scheme in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Texas.</p>
