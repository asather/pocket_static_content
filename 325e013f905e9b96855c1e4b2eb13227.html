<h1>Judge satisfied media understand rules during jury selection</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The judge who threatened to hold the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and a photographer for the newspaper in contempt over two pictures taken during jury selection for the Wilkinsburg mass shooting case changed course on Friday.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski, instead, decided that his goals of providing a fair and just trial for the defendants while ensuring local media are aware of rules governing photography have now been met.</p>
<p>After jury selection for Cheron Shelton, 32, of Lincoln-Lemington, and Robert Thomas, 31, of Homewood, began on Monday, the Post-Gazette photographed the two defendants being led by sheriff's deputies into the courtroom.</p>
<p>Although the photographs were taken from the designated media area on the fifth floor of the Allegheny County Courthouse, Judge Borkowski said on Tuesday that the pictures violated a local rule. The judge interprets that rule to forbid photographs from including subject matter outside of the designated area, even if they are taken from inside.</p>
<p>Judge Borkowski ordered that photographer Andrew Rush appear in court on Wednesday morning and told him it was possible he, and the Post-Gazette could be held in contempt.</p>
<p>The matter was recessed for Mr. Rush to obtain separate counsel, and another hearing was scheduled for Friday morning.</p>
<p>At the hearing Friday, the judge began by saying he was in a "relatively conciliatory mood."</p>
<p>He passed out packets to the attorneys that included both state law and local rules, saying that it was his belief that Mr. Rush violated the local policy — and that he did it in a case that deserves to be resolved appropriately.</p>
<p>Shelton and Thomas are accused of killing five people and an unborn child during a backyard cookout in Wilkinsburg on March 9, 2016. Testimony is expected to start in the trial on Feb. 3. Thus far, seven jurors have been selected in the capital case.</p>
<p>"My goal and my focus throughout the entirety of these proceedings is to get this case to trial and to disposition," the judge said. "It's been in the system for four years. It's had two judges. It cries out for resolution."</p>
<p>The judge did not require any testimony or argument at the hearing. Instead, he spoke from the bench about his perception of what occurred. Judge Borkowski said he believed that Mr. Rush never received any instruction as to where and what types of photos he could take in the courthouse, and instead likely relied on prior experience and past practice of others.</p>
<p>"Of course, ignorance of the law is no excuse for it,” Judge Borkowski said.</p>
<p>Local media archives show that publishing photographs just like the ones of Shelton and Thomas is not unusual.</p>
<p>"If the media was unaware of the law, or relied on past practices, they are now dispossessed of that," Judge Borkowski said.</p>
<p>Toward the Post-Gazette, Judge Borkowski said he did not find any intent on the part of the newspaper to disrupt the courthouse or jury selection process.</p>
<p>"I do find it irresponsible they did not educate Mr. Rush and others who are coming into this courthouse as to what the law is and their responsibilities."</p>
<p>As he closed the issue, the judge said that he believed his purposes had been served.</p>
<p>Patrick Thomassey, who represented Mr. Rush, thanked the judge for his decision, but also said he believed the original 2007 order the judge believed was violated was ambiguous and demanded clarification.</p>
<p>Fritz Byers represented the Post-Gazette, along with Frederick Frank.</p>
<p>After the hearing, Mr. Byers said Judge Borkowski emphasized during the hearing his commitment to protect the constitutional rights of the defendants and the press.</p>
<p>"He made a public acknowledgment that both of those rights are crucial to the society and neither one is paramount,” Mr. Byers said. The judge also “wanted to emphasize how important it is in the course of a criminal trial that the media be familiar with governing laws and orders of the court and comply with them and dispel any sense that there was a knowing and intentional violation.”</p>
<p>Mr. Byers said that the November 2007 order was not entirely clear as to what it permits and what it prohibits and that the ambiguity is heightened by years of past practice, which the paper and its photographers had been relying on.</p>
<p>The Post-Gazette will likely accept the judge’s invitation to seek clarification of the order, Mr. Byers said, and may propose a revised order that would eliminate any ambiguity and provide clear rules.</p>
