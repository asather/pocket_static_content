<h1>Put Yemen back together </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Over the centuries, the Romans, the Ottomans, the British, the Egyptians and the Saudis have all tried and failed to use military force to change the internal politics of Yemen.</p>
<p>Ignorant of their own history, and driven by the arrogance and recklessness of a young prince, the Saudis have again mired themselves in a country described as the Afghanistan of the Arabian Peninsula, but this time with America’s backing.</p>
<p>As the conflict in Yemen enters its sixth year, it is the Yemeni people who have suffered the most. The Saudis’ indiscriminate bombings of apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, farms and bridges — using American-made trucks, tanks and bombs, dropped by American-made jets, flown by American-trained pilots and refueled by the U.S. Air Force — have created an appalling humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>The Saudi-led war against the Houthi rebels and their allies, has been compounded by the spread of both cholera and the coronavirus. Lacking hospital beds and basic medicine, the United Nations says Yemen’s health care system has effectively collapsed. An estimated 100,000 people have been killed, 4 million have been displaced, and another 24 million are in acute need of aid.</p>
<p>Even after Saudi Arabia’s indifference to civilian deaths became clear, arms sales increased under President Barack Obama. During his eight years in power, Mr. Obama approved $65 billion worth of arms sales to the Saudis, more than any other previous president. Last year, President Donald Trump bypassed Congress to push through an $8.1 billion sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan.</p>
<p>None of these arms, however, have made the Saudis a more effective combatant in Yemen. The architect of this diplomatic and military failure, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, predicted that the war would be over in weeks. Instead there is no end in sight to a conflict that is only emboldening the kingdom’s mortal enemy, Iran.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has the fifth-largest defense budget in the world in large part because this war is costing the kingdom a fortune — an estimated $50 billion a year. By contrast, the costs to the Iranians, who provide support to the Houthi rebels, are minimal. The Iranians therefore hope the war lasts indefinitely because it weakens Saudi Arabia’s economy and its reputation in the world.</p>
<p>America’s Saudi policy, to which Yemen is a subset, consists of endorsing whatever Saudi Arabia wants to do in the region, even if that means the widespread destruction of Yemen. America has involved itself enough in the conflict to take partial blame for the disastrous outcomes, but has not involved itself enough to break the stalemate.</p>
<p>This war, which has no strategy and no achievable end, could not go on without the support of the United States. It’s time that America and its allies stop exploiting the regional conflict for profit and work instead to put Yemen back together.</p>
