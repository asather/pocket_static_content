<h1>PIAA postpones basketball tournament for two weeks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hopes of a state championship are on hold for two weeks for high school basketball teams in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The PIAA has decided to postpone the boys and girls tournaments for two weeks because of concerns over COVID-19. The PIAA announced the decision Thursday afternoon. The Class 2A swimming and diving championships scheduled for Friday and Saturday at Bucknell University have also been postponed.</p>
<p>The decision to postpone the championships were made by a unanimous decision of the PIAA board of directors.&nbsp;The basketball playoffs started last weekend and the quarterfinals were scheduled for Friday and Saturday. The championships were supposed to be March 19-21 in Hershey.</p>
<p>If the tournament resumes in two weeks, the PIAA said&nbsp;“modifications will include limiting team and spectator parties, health re-certification by authorized medical professionals and changes to game day procedures.”</p>
<p>The PIAA’s decision came a day after the NBA suspended its season because of the coronavirus and the NCAA announced that only immediate family members will be allowed to attend March Madness games. But the PIAA still staged the final day of the Class 3A swimming and diving championships Thursday at Bucknell University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many questions still have to be answered. Will teams be permitted to practice during the stoppage of the tournament? Will the start of spring sports be pushed back?</p>
<p>The PIAA said more information will be given to schools in coming days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The board of directors, in consultation with various health departments, believes this action is in the best interest of our member schools, their student-athletes, sports officials and the public. PIAA, by enforcing a two-week hiatus from our basketball and (2A) swimming championships, believes this action will allow schools to performance self-assessments and make decisions to promote optimal health conditions in their communities.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>North Catholic has its boys and girls teams in the quarterfinals. Molly Rottmann is North Catholic’s girls coach, but she also has a son, Hans, who is on the boys team.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m in the Twilight Zone. This is uncharted territory,” Rottmann said. “Honestly, this is so hard because I have different emotions. Obviously, keeping kids safe is first. Everything that’s going on in the big picture, what’s being canceled, gives you an idea of what’s going on. Doing things to keep kids and families safe is a good decision.</p>
<p>“But emotionally, I have nine seniors on my team. My son is a senior. The teams are making runs. On the emotional side, I feel bad for the kids. It’s hard to say, ‘Oh, that might have been your last game.’ Things are so unfinished. I just have mixed emotions on the whole thing.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Butler was one of eight WPIAL boys and 10 girls teams to make the PIAA quarterfinals. Before the PIAA’s decision to cancel the tournament, Butler coach Matt Clement talked about the possibility of playing games without fans.</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about this a lot and whatever is safest for the kids is what we should do,” Butler coach Matt Clement said. “I’m assuming the people making these decisions are doing what’s safest for kids and that’s what we’ll go with. I’m not a crisis manager. Do we want fans to be there? Yes, one billion percent. But we understand, no matter what happens. The NBA suspended its season, so how can you argue with whatever the PIAA calls? You just hope that every day more people figure this thing out.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides Butler, the other eight WPIAL boys teams who had advanced to the quarterfinals were North Catholic, Lincoln Park, Beaver Falls, Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, Sto-Rox, Cornell and Bishop Canevin. Mt. Lebanon was scheduled to play a second-round game Thursday night.</p>
<p>The WPIAL girls teams that had made the quarterfinals were North Allegheny, Bethel Park, Trinity, Chartiers Valley, Thomas Jefferson, North Catholic, Mohawk, Beaver, Ellis School and Rochester.</p>
