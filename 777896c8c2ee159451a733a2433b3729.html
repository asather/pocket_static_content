<h1>As COVID-19 relief talks collapse, lawmakers face prospect of returning empty-handed to constituents</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON — Less than a month before Election Day, talks to reach a deal for COVID-19 relief collapsed, with President Donald Trump telling White House officials to end negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., after months of trying to reach a deal.</p>
<p>The announcement sent stocks on Wall Street plummeting and rippled through Main Street business, local governments and unemployed workers who have been desperately waiting for another relief package from Washington.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump — in a series of tweets posted less than 24 hours after being released from the hospital after contracting COVID-19 — said Ms. Pelosi did not negotiate in good faith.</p>
<p>“I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hard-working Americans and Small Business,” the president wrote.</p>
<p>The breakdown in talks puts lawmakers in both parties, especially those in tough reelection battles, in the difficult position of returning to their constituents with empty hands during a global pandemic and economic crisis. With no more negotiations until a new Congress convenes, no additional aid would be approved for struggling Americans until at least next February.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s move also increases the tension between Ms. Pelosi and a sizable group of moderate House Democrats, including Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, who have pressed her to be more willing to lower the size of the legislation in pursuit of compromise.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb joined 18 other House Democrats, including Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Lackawanna, in voting against a $2.2 trillion package last Thursday. The bill, an updated version of the HEROES Act, was approved by a narrow 214-207 vote, with all Republicans voting against it.</p>
<p>“We need a bipartisan deal that can actually be signed into law and get money into the hands of people who need it right now,” Mr. Lamb wrote in an unusually direct statement after the vote. “And we all know that won’t happen with this HEROES bill.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb expressed that he was losing patience with the political game of chicken in which both parties appeared willing to wait and see which side caves first. He wrote that Ms. Pelosi should be willing to accept a $1.6 trillion deal proposed by the White House and Republicans.</p>
<p>“The reality is this: We can take their deal and save the jobs of thousands of airline workers in my district, or they get laid off,” Mr. Lamb wrote.</p>
<p>“We can get $400 for unemployed workers and another round of stimulus checks, or nothing,” he wrote. “We can get some funding for state and local governments, or none. We can get new funding for small businesses, or not.”</p>
<p>“We should take the money that’s on the table so we can save jobs and help people survive this pandemic right now,” Mr. Lamb wrote.</p>
<p>The debate over how much additional money to spend has played out in Washington ever since the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was signed into law March 27.</p>
<p>The largest single relief package in U.S. history, the CARES Act doled out $2.3 trillion in small business loans, $1,200 direct cash payments to most Americans, a boost to unemployment compensation and health care funding. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill worked at warp speed to unanimously pass the bill, as the COVID-19 outbreak swept the country.</p>
<p>Congress and the White House, however, have been stalled on a second round of aid.</p>
<p>Republicans, including Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Reps. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters and Mike Kelly, R-Butler, were leading the charge to reopen businesses in May and June with the hope that an economic recovery would replace the need for more government spending.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Democrats — including Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills and Mr. Lamb — have called for even greater funding. They have pushed for another round of direct cash payments to Americans, hazard pay for essential workers, additional aid to state and local governments and funding for nursing homes or long-term care facilities.</p>
<p>On May 15, the House passed the HEROES Act, a $3.4 trillion bill that served as a starting point in negotiations between the two chambers. Mr. Lamb voted against that bill, too, saying he preferred legislation that was more bipartisan.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans and the White House did not start negotiations in earnest until July, days before temporary CARES Act programs lapsed.</p>
<p>Both parties had been inching closer to an agreement on a top-line spending number.</p>
<p>The gulf between what Ms. Pelosi and the White House have been willing to support has shrunk from about $2.4 trillion in July to about $600 billion this week. Democratic negotiators called for nothing less than $2.2 trillion, while the White House wouldn’t budge above a $1.6 trillion package.</p>
<p>Yet major policy differences remained, including whether supplemental weekly unemployment benefits should total $600, as Ms. Pelosi demands, or $400, as the White House wants.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Mr. Doyle wrote in a newsletter to constituents that he stood by Ms. Pelosi’s negotiation strategy.</p>
<p>“The White House and Senate Republicans refused to negotiate for months,” Mr. Doyle wrote in his newsletter to constituents Tuesday. “When they did start talking, they insisted on a much smaller bill.”</p>
<p>“As a result, House Democrats proposed a compromise halfway between the two amounts,” Mr. Doyle said, “and the House approved an updated version of the Heroes Act which met that target with my support last week.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump pulled the plug on talks as unemployment remains historically high.</p>
<p>In August, after the supplemental unemployment benefits lapsed, the Pittsburgh region’s seasonally adjusted jobless rate stood at 10.5%, down slightly from 12.8% recorded in the previous two months, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry.</p>
<p>About 121,600 people were unemployed throughout the seven-county metro region, more than double the 53,500 unemployed people the state counted in August 2019.</p>
<p>Employers in the region added just 6,400 positions back in August, down roughly 100,000 jobs from August 2019.</p>
