<p>Cole Tucker bet on himself, and his faith in his video-game skills might have cost him in a big way.</p>
<p>The Pirates shortstop participated in Major League Baseball’s “MLB: The Show” players’ tournament this weekend as Pittsburgh’s representative, and on Saturday he was up against Phillies left-fielder Rhys Hoskins. Tucker was holding his own for a guy <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/15/pirates-baseball-cole-tucker-mlb-the-show/stories/202004150101" target="_blank">without much experience</a> with the video game heading into this competition, playing Hoskins to a 0-0 draw at the top of the sixth inning.</p>
<p>That’s when the virtual version of Hoskins came up to the plate for real-life Hoskins’ digital Phillies squad. Tucker, who was playing with the Pirates, took the opportunity to make a bold declaration: “If you hit a homer, I will name my first-born child Rhys.”</p>
<p>The words hadn’t even left Tucker’s mouth before virtual Hoskins blasted a homer into the left-field stands of video-game PNC Park, putting real-life Hoksins’ team up 1-0 and forcing Tucker to immediately eat his words.</p>
<p>“Never Mind! Never mind!” Tucker backtracked as Hoskins yelled “everybody heard that!” four times just to make sure everyone watching their Twitch stream was aware of what this homer meant for Tucker’s future progeny.</p>
<p>Tucker wound up losing the game 2-0, and both Hoskins and the Phillies’ Twitter account appear intent on not letting Tucker forget the consequences of his hubris any time soon.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ Twitter account, in contrast, chose to focus on Tucker’s defensive achievements from that game rather than him possibly having to name his first kid after a Philly.</p>
<p>At least Tucker seemed to like the idea of naming a child after that particular Philly.</p>
<p>“Rhys Tucker’s got a nice ring to it,” he begrudgingly admitted.</p>
<p>As he waits for a decision to be made on what to do with a potential 2020 MLB season, Tucker will probably continue&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/03/10/cole-tucker-pittsburgh-infield-adam-frazier-pirates-trade-rumors/stories/202003100081" target="_blank">practicing his drumming skills</a>, watching his <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/03/30/Pirates-baseball-movies-Cole-Tucker-breaking-down-Sandlot-Summer-Catch-Bull-Durham/stories/202003260147" target="_blank">favorite baseball movies</a> and, thanks to this most recent development, figure out the best way to explain to the future mother of his first child why he (or she) has to be named Rhys.</p>
