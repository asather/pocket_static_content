<h1>Public hearings, meetings ahead for parks tax issue</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At least one public hearing on how to handle the new parks tax revenue has been scheduled for early March.</p>
<p>Councilman Anthony Coghill confirmed Wednesday that a public hearing will take place on March 5 at 6 p.m. in Council Chambers to discuss a proposal that will create a trust fund for the new tax revenue.</p>
<p>The governing body agreed last week to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/02/05/Pittsburgh-City-Council-parks-trust-fund-tax-increase-peduto-conservancy/stories/202002050126" target="_blank">start over on the enabling legislation to create a fund</a> for the estimated $10 million a year expected to be generated for the city’s 165 parks.</p>
<p>The money will come from a half-mill property tax increase — $50 on every $100,000 of assessed real estate value — that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2019/11/06/Pittsburgh-parks-tax-vote-referendum-dilemma-city-council-conservancy-Bill-Peduto/stories/201911060143" target="_blank">voters narrowly approved</a> in November after the nonprofit Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, with the Mayor Bill Peduto’s support, petitioned for the ballot referendum.</p>
<p>An original iteration of the bill introduced by Mr. Coghill and&nbsp;Councilwoman Deb Gross that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/01/21/anthony-coghill-deb-gross-pittsburgh-parks-tax-split-among-nine-districts/stories/202001210116" target="_blank">aimed to split the money equally among nine council districts</a> was met with criticism from Councilman Ricky Burgess and the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/01/29/Council-bill-on-parks-tax-money-delayed-by-legal-opinion/stories/202001290144" target="_blank">city’s Law Department</a>. Now council is working with a shell of a bill until hearing from the public and debating the issue further.</p>
<p>A separate public hearing for the mayor’s bill on the official creation of the tax will also be scheduled, though a date has not yet been released. Mr. Burgess said council hopes to hold the hearings on the same day, though that has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess, who chairs the Urban Recreation Committee, introduced a third piece of legislation Tuesday, aiming to adopt the conservancy’s&nbsp;“Parks Plan” as the city’s official road map for using the parks revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Wednesday he motioned to hold a special fact-finding meeting on the plan. He was met with requests from Ms. Gross, Mr. Coghill and Council President Theresa Kail-Smith to arrange for presentations on the conservancy’s finances and more detailed data sets that explain the conservancy’s rationale in creating the “Parks Plan.”</p>
<p>The conservancy’s multi-year plan proposes allocating money for routine maintenance, capital projects and programming <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/07/15/Pittsburgh-Parks-Conservancy-400-million-behind-repairs-165-parks/stories/201907150087" target="_blank">according to an equity and needs-based formula</a>.</p>
<p>“The kind of glossy brochure has been presented publicly, that is available on the [conservancy’s] website,” Ms. Gross said, adding that she wants to see&nbsp;“the raw data.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith said her&nbsp;“ultimate goal is to find who funded and pushed the plan.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/10/25/pittsburgh-parks-tax-ballot-question-conservancy-PUMP-referendum/stories/201910260042" target="_blank">Oct. 25 campaign finance reports</a>,&nbsp;the parks conservancy contributed $634,000 in direct funding to the ballot referendum campaign, as well as $80,000 in in-kind contributions. The Pittsburgh Urban Magnet Project, or PUMP, directly contributed $45,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess agreed to work with members but said that his concern is focused on how the new tax revenue will be spent.</p>
<p>“That’s my interest. My advocacy for the plan has nothing to do with any outside organization, lobbying or promotion. My intention is solely, narrowly focused on how the money is spent,” he said.</p>
<p>The conservancy did not immediately respond for comment.</p>
