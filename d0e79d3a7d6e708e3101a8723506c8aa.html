<h1>Penguins look for 'redemption' in rematch against Lightning</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Don’t call it revenge.</p>
<p>That’s probably too strong a word to describe how the Penguins are viewing Tuesday night’s game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. But after falling 4-2 Thursday in a game that was, well ... not their best, there is one word to describe it.</p>
<p>“Redemption,” forward Jared McCann said. “We’ve got another shot to show them we got better.”</p>
<p>The Lightning bolted to a 2-0, first-period lead in Florida. From there, the Penguins squandered five power play chances, including a 5-on-3 near the end of the game.</p>
<p>“It was pretty intense,” Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said. “Kind of a playoff-style game against a good team that’s opportunistic. I feel like we didn’t have a great start. We need to make sure we’re better and get a better result.”</p>
<p>The Penguins are used to opportunities like this one. They lost to the New Jersey Devils on Nov. 15 and then redeemed themselves exactly one week later at PPG Paints Arena. They lost in Boston on Jan 16 and then beat the Bruins at home days later. They lost to Philadelphia the final game before the trade deadline and then came out of the break to beat their in-state rival the first game after the break.</p>
<p>These bounce-back performances are not limited to just common opponents. You have to go all the way back to the middle of November to find a time when the Penguins lost consecutive games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s good we play them right away like this,” defenseman Marcus Pettersson said. “We weren’t happy as a team, especially with that first period. It’s going to be a great challenge. … It’s going to be another one of those playoff-mindset games. We have a lot of those this last stretch here. We have to make sure we’re ready for it.”</p>
<p><strong>Shift in the top six</strong></p>
<p>When Jared McCann was traded from the Florida Panthers to the Penguins one year ago this month, he quickly found that Pittsburgh would provide more than just a change of scenery. It also came with a new job description: winger.</p>
<p>For his entire career dating back to some of the first times he put on skates, McCann defined himself as a center. But the Penguins felt his speed, grip-it-and-rip-it mentality and offensive instincts made him more valuable playing on the wing.</p>
<p>This year, injuries forced the Penguins to rethink that idea. During at least one game, the top three centers (Crosby, Malkin and Nick Bjugstad) were all injured. That led McCann to play a bulk of the year in the middle.</p>
<p>But with Malkin and Crosby back, it’s time for McCann to resume his new role on the wing. But now the question becomes whose wing?</p>
<p>McCann has skated mostly on Crosby’s wing. But during Sunday’s win at Florida, he shifted onto Malkin’s wing, something he did a bit over the last couple weeks. Meanwhile, Patric Hornqvist was moved onto Crosby’s line.</p>
<p>Those line combinations held up at practice on Monday. Crosby skated between Hornqvist and Dominik Simon. Malkin skated between McCann and Bryan Rust.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to figure out line combinations that have success,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “We tweak them here and there to see if it gives us some help or some traction or some momentum. Sometimes we do that through the course of the game. Sometimes it’s based on the opponent and what we think the need is.</p>
<p>“Some teams play a speed game. Some teams are heavier. Based on that, we try to look at all those factors and put combinations together that are going to have success. Then we watch during the course of the game and based on what we see, we try to make the best decisions we can to help the team.”</p>
<p><strong>Injury updates</strong></p>
<p>While rookie defenseman John Marino was schedule to have facial surgery on Monday, several other Penguins are in their own rehab processes.</p>
<p>Dominik Kahun (concussion) skated individually on Monday morning and is making progress, Sullivan said. Forward Nick Bjugstad (core muscle surgery) is still rehabbing off the ice. Defenseman Brian Dumoulin is also in the off-ice portion of his rehab.</p>
<p>Despite the numerous injuries, the Penguins have managed to surge ahead into a fight for the top spot in the Metropolitan Division. They’ll have to keep it up as the injury issues continue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ve just stuck with it,” Crosby said. “Different guys have stepped up. At different times, we’ve gotten big plays from everybody in the lineup. That’s what you need to do in that type of situation. You don’t have time to feel sorry for yourself or look for excuses. We’ve got to continue to find ways. It’s going to get more and more challenging as the season goes on.”</p>
