<h1>Biden aides say COVID results will be released</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON —&nbsp;Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s campaign is committing to releasing the results of all future COVID-19 tests the candidate takes.</p>
<p>Biden told reporters Saturday in Wilmington that he was not tested earlier in the day but would be tested Sunday morning. His campaign said he tested negative for COVID twice on Friday.</p>
<p>Biden spokesman Andrew Bates repeated Saturday evening that the former vice president is tested “regularly.” But before <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/10/04/Doctor-Trump-improving-health-condition-concerning-coronavirus-hospital/stories/202010040163" target="_blank">President Donald Trump’s coronavirus diagnosis</a> earlier this week Biden had not disclosed full details of his testing protocol or the results of each test.</p>
<p>Bates said in the statement that Biden was not in “close contact” with Trump, his family members or his aides during their debate Tuesday night. Several people in Trump’s orbit have tested positive in recent days.</p>
<p>Biden’s campaign also emphasized in its latest statement that Biden and his campaign for months has followed public health guidelines on wearing masks and social distancing. At the same time, Trump has held large public rallies without requiring masks or enforcing social distancing.</p>
<p>Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows said Trump went through a “very concerning” period Friday and faces a “critical” next two days in his fight against COVID-19 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.</p>
<p>“We’re still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery,” Meadows said. In an update Saturday night, Trump’s chief doctor expressed cautious optimism but added that the president was “not yet out of the woods.”</p>
<p>That was&nbsp;in contrast to a rosier assessment moments earlier by Trump doctors, who took pains not to reveal the president had received supplemental oxygen at the White House before his hospital admission.</p>
<p>Trump remained at the military hospital on Sunday. He offered his own assessment of his status <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/10/04/Doctor-Trump-improving-health-condition-concerning-coronavirus-hospital/stories/202010040163" target="_blank">Saturday evening in a video from his hospital suite</a>, saying he was beginning to feel better and hoped to “be back soon.”</p>
<p>In the four-minute video, Trump says he “wasn’t feeling so well” when he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday after testing positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>But he says that “I feel much better now” and that “We’re working hard to get me all the way back.”</p>
<p>Trump sounds a little raspy in the video, but he appears to be in good spirits as he says he’s fighting for the millions of people who have had the virus across the world.</p>
<p>He also thanks the doctors and nurses treating him as well as well as the world leaders and Americans who have sent their well wishes.</p>
