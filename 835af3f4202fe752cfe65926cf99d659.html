<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday ordered the commonwealth flag on all commonwealth facilities, public buildings and grounds to fly at half-staff in honor of a Rostraver West Newton Emergency Services supervisor, who was killed early Sunday while responding to a crash on Interstate 70 in Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>“Matthew Smelser’s death is a tragic reminder of the risk taken by emergency personnel across the state each day to rescue Pennsylvanians in distress,” Mr. Wolf said Monday in a statement.</p>
<p>“We need to do our part to exercise caution while traveling, especially during winter weather or when approaching the scene of an accident,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Smelser was killed just before 6 a.m. Sunday as his ambulance was struck by a tractor trailer. He had just exited his emergency vehicle to help a crash victim on Interstate 70 when he was hit, state police said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crash happened between Exit 49-Smithton and Exit 46A-PA 51 South.</p>
<p>Commonwealth flags will be lowered until sunset on Monday and on the day of interment, which has not yet been announced. The United States flag is to remain at full staff throughout the tribute, according to a statement from Mr. Wolf.</p>
<p>Mr. Smelser’s employer, Rostraver West Newton Emergency Services, announced his death via Facebook on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>“It’s with great sorrow and pain that we announce the tragic loss of Paramedic Supervisor Matthew Smelser, he was killed this morning while attending to an injured person on interstate 70,” the emergency services group said.</p>
<p>“Please keep him, his family and all of us in your thoughts and prayers.”</p>
