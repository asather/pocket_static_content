<h1>Pirates claim RHP Carson Fulmer off waivers, designate Guillermo Heredia for assignment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In their continuing search for pitching help, the Pirates have turned over another stone.</p>
<p>The team announced Monday it claimed right-hander Carson Fulmer off waivers from the Detroit Tigers. To make room for Fulmer on the 40-man roster, outfielder Guillermo Heredia was designated for assignment.</p>
<p>The Chicago White Sox originally drafted Fulmer with the eighth overall pick in 2015, but after a promising beginning to his career in a handful of starts in 2017, Fulmer sputtered.</p>
<p>Over the next two seasons with the White Sox, he bounced between Class AAA Charlotte and Chicago, holding an ERA between 4.76 and 8.07 as both a starter and reliever at his different stops throughout those years. As a result, Fulmer was designated for assignment after failing to make Chicago’s opening day roster this season, after which he was claimed by the Detroit Tigers.</p>
<p>Fulmer, now fully transitioned to a bullpen role, struggled in limited action with Detroit this season, allowing five earned runs over 6.2 innings of work for a 6.75 ERA. Those results were not good enough to protect him from being designated for assignment again late last week, when the Tigers re-activated pitcher Buck Farmer from the injured list.</p>
<p>As for Heredia, the 29-year-old was brought in this offseason to add to the Pirates’ outfield depth, and when right fielder Gregory Polanco tested positive for COVID-19 at the start of the season, Heredia found himself in a fairly regular role for a time. After appearing in eight games, though, with just a .188 batting average, Heredia was optioned to the alternate training site in Altoona when MLB rosters shrank from 30 players to 28 on Aug. 5.</p>
<p>With this move, the hope is that Fulmer’s original potential that made him a top-10 pick in the first place, can be rediscovered. Back then, Fulmer was the college national pitcher of the year at Vanderbilt with a 1.83 ERA.</p>
<p>At the very least, he will have a familiar face in the Pirates’ clubhouse in left fielder Bryan Reynolds, who was his college teammate at Vanderbilt. Beyond that, Pirates pitching coach Oscar Marin and Fulmer will get to work, trying to rekindle the parts of Fulmer’s game that helped him have so much success in the past.</p>
