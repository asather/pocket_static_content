<h1>Pitt report says Congress needs to step up funding to Pa. for election costs amid pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Congress has provided less than a fifth of the funding that Pennsylvania needs to prepare its 2020 elections for the impacts of COVID-19, according to a new report co-authored by the University of Pittsburgh Institute for Cyber Law, Policy and Security.</p>
<p>The collaborative report, based on cost analysis and interviews with state and local elections officials in five states, estimated that Pennsylvania will need between $79.1 million and $90.1 million to hold safe, secure and fair elections this year, warning that that the $14.2 million allocated so far by the federal government is nowhere near enough to “ensure a system that is sufficiently resilient against pandemics or other emergencies.”</p>
<p>Estimates showed that the cost to prepare for elections in the five states — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio — already exceeds the $400 million Congress allocated across the entire country in its third stimulus package in March.</p>

<p>“What’s clear to me and what’s clear to others is that state and local officials really need more money, and Congress ought to be the one stepping in to do that,” said Christopher Deluzio, policy director for Pitt’s institute.</p>
<p>Insisting that the threat of COVID-19 on elections is not isolated in certain towns and counties, Mr. Deluzio said his contacts with election officials have revealed that counties have had to ramp up their planning quickly for the increased volume of mail-in ballots, far beyond what was expected when the mail-in ballot option was first instituted last year before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Administrative costs will be expensive, the report noted, and Mr. Deluzio said a backlog of ballot applications from workers who are staying at home — and the need to prepare for in-person voting —&nbsp;makes&nbsp;“a recipe for overwhelmed elections offices and things that could impact the orderly administration of elections and the vote.”</p>
<p>Of the nearly $100 million cost of preparing for Pennsylvania’s elections, $61.6 million to $72.2 million will be borne by the counties, according to the report, while the state will be responsible for $17.5 million to $17.9 million.</p>
<p>The state’s costs include purchasing protective kits for precincts, investing in elections infrastructure and technology and educating voters on changes to the election — since those who vote by mail will alleviate in-person turnout on Election Day, the report says.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania’s 67 counties, a majority of the estimated cost will go toward mailing, processing and tabulating absentee and mail ballots — which could cost up to $47 million alone — for both the primary and general elections. Another $24.2 million could be needed for in-person voting precautions, including increasing the pay of poll workers to address shortages.</p>
<p>If the federal government doesn’t allocate more money, Mr. Deluzio worries that there will be disparities from county to county as they try to process the influx of mail-in ballots. Some counties are more strapped for cash, he noted, and are anticipating trouble in manning polling places — and not every county will be able to proactively send mail-in ballot applications to all registered voters and cover postage, like Allegheny County did recently.</p>
<p>A county with more financial resources, too, will be able to do a better job at notifying voters about changes in polling places and educating them about voting options, Mr. Deluzio added.</p>
<p>“The risk there, of course, is that lots of voters might get left behind,” Mr. Deluzio said.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania has officially received the $14 million in federal grants from the third stimulus package, Department of State spokeswoman Wanda Murren confirmed. The state can use it in any way it wants, as long as the spending is related to the impacts of COVID-19 on this year’s elections.</p>
<p>The state also will be able to utilize $15.1 million in election security grants, which operate under different rules and aren’t specifically related to alleviating the effects of the virus.</p>
<p>In a letter to the counties, state officials said Pennsylvania will use a portion of the federal money on technology and security improvements, post-election audits, worker training and support, voter education, precinct protection measures and the implementation of a&nbsp;“statewide online accessible&nbsp;vote by mail option so that voters with disabilities can vote by mail,” among other efforts.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/election/2020?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/02/election-2020-landing-page-insert-banner" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>The rest — $6 million from the stimulus package and $7 million in elections security funds — will go to the counties. Allegheny County will get $626,000 and $731,000, respectively, between the programs. It will have to use the $626,000 on this year’s election cycle alone.</p>
<p>The state legislature could shift the budget to allocate more funds, Mr. Deluzio said, but the “very dire fiscal situation” in Harrisburg makes that unlikely.&nbsp;</p>
