<h1>Sharpsburg businesses unite to make COVID-19 masks</h1>

<p>When Gov. Tom Wolf, the state Department of Health and the CDC suggested <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/04/03/Wolf-asks-all-Pennsylvanians-to-wear-masks/stories/202004030156?cid=search" target="_blank">everyone wear masks</a> to avoid catching or spreading COVID-19, three Sharpsburg businesses went to work.</p>

<p>When the Original Mattress Factory on Freeport Road was deemed a non-life-sustaining business by the governor on March 17, Scott Markel, vice president, was forced to close the business he helped create and put all his employees on temporary leave.</p>
<p>Releasing employees is heartbreaking, Mr. Markel said, even with the mattress factory able to pay them for an additional two weeks.</p>
<p>Luckily, Mr. Markel used his company’s experience making hospital mattresses to open a new door: They called hospitals to see if they needed mattresses. They were told they needed face masks.</p>
<p>So the company applied for a waiver from the state to make medical equipment — not the N95 masks used for surgery but the loop masks worn by doctors and nurses every day.</p>
<p>They received a huge order from the Cleveland Clinic for the two-ply polypropylene and cotton masks, and the Original Mattress Factory in Sharpsburg and its factories in Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, joined to fill it.</p>
<p>“We’ve always made hospital mattresses, so when the opportunity to make masks for the Cleveland Clinic arrived, we went straight to work,” Mr. Markel said. They called back 10 employees and started making the masks April 4 in two shifts starting at 6 a.m., producing more than 2,000 medical-grade masks every day.</p>
<p>“It’s been so fulfilling for the employees,” he said. “They’ve had enough of social distancing and are happy for this opportunity and are having a great time.”</p>
<p>He does, however, have one regret. “We’ve received many requests for local donations, but we’re at capacity now.”</p>
<p>But that need is being met by an entrepreneur just down the road, where Freeport Road turns into Main Street. Lane Tierney, of Mossy Lane Products, has put her custom-made clothing boutique on hiatus during the pandemic and has turned to making masks for her friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>Ms. Tierney retired from her special education teaching job at Dorseyville Middle School in the Fox Chapel Area School District to start her business two years ago. She found her space just across the street while visiting her co-worker’s art gallery, Ketchup City Creative. Nanci Goldberg, Dorseyville art teacher, and her husband, Christian Kahle, opened the creative event space in March 2018.</p>
<p>“Everyone was so nice when I first moved in,” Ms. Tierney said. “They made me feel so welcome! Roots of Faith United Methodist Church sent a fruit basket, and the neighbors helped paint the outside of the building.”</p>
<p>So when she had to shut down just as her new business was ramping up, the custom fashion designer chose to give back to the community that had opened its arms to her — making and donating masks.</p>
<p>“I’m using all my many moments of free time and making masks out of the materials I have on hand,” Ms. Tierney said. A photo on her website shows her peering over the top of a mask bearing Penguins logos. “The material was left over from a pair of fleece pajamas I had just made for a customer before I had to close my door.”</p>
<p>She went across the street to Sharpsburg Towers and offered them to the seniors living in the high-rise apartments. “They’re older, and they’re in close quarters,” she said, remembering the tenants who had come to peruse her custom clothing store.</p>
<p>She also remembered the kindness of Roots of Faith and delivered a batch of masks to its community helpers.</p>
<p>“Those people are out delivering food to people,” Ms. Tierney said. “I figured they are out helping, and that’s who I was trying to target.”</p>
<p>Another Sharpsburg neighbor, Hez Bohin, also turned her creative talents to mask production. She is a resin jeweler by trade but got out her sewing machine to make the snug-fitting fabric masks to protect her friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>A brand new sewing machine was the reward Ava Arnold received when she donated masks she made in her Wexford home to Roots of Faith. A sixth grader at Provident Charter School in Troy Hill, Ava also donated masks to nearby nursing homes and filmed a seven-minute tutorial so others her age could learn how to help.</p>
<p>Art Kleitz, owner of Advanced Sewing Technologies on Penn Street in Sharpsburg, heard about her generosity through Roots of Faith. Advanced Sewing supplies new and used industrial sewing machines to the textile manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Kleitz had planned on giving Ava one of his commercial machines but, when that turned out to be too large for the young girl, he bought a new sewing machine from his supplier.</p>
<p>“We’ll do anything for a kid her age trying to help other people,” Mr. Kleitz said. “The world has been good to me, and I don’t mind passing it on.”</p>
