<h1>Lawsuit: Former Monroeville nursing home administrator says officials gave state wrong data on COVID cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The former administrator of a Monroeville nursing home, which is owned by the same group that owns Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County, filed a whistleblower lawsuit last week against the facility alleging he was fired after he tried to correct inaccurate COVID-19 case information given to state and county health officials in July.</p>
<p>Ron Berlingo, who had worked at the 120-bed Monroeville Rehabilitation and Wellness Center since September, said he was fired on July 29 by Tom Lowden, an executive with the group that owns the facility, according to the lawsuit filed Friday in Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas.</p>
<p>He was fired a day after Mr. Berlingo spoke alone on the phone to Joan Hebden, a consultant with the state Department of Health assigned to work with Monroeville, telling her about the problems with the COVID-19 case information that she was given in a phone call on July 28 by the facility’s director of nursing, Pam Poremba.</p>
<p>Mr. Lowden had warned Mr. Berlingo several times earlier in July “that he should not speak to anyone with the State without the attorneys present,” according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Why he was not to speak on the phone without an attorney, and why the facility was not accurately reporting numbers to the state or county was never made clear to Mr. Berlingo, said his attorney, Adam Gorzelsky.</p>
<p>“That’s kind of what [Mr. Berlingo] was baffled by through all of this,” Mr. Gorzelsky said Wednesday. “The county and state health departments were wonderful through all of this, offering support, helping with a staffing agency, offering other resources to help.”</p>
<p>“But every time he spoke to [the state or county health officials] he was rebuffed by Mr. Lowden,” he said. Mr. Berlingo “wanted to keep the residents and staff as safe as possible, and as administrator it was his job to get help wherever he can.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if maybe the owners saw a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/08/12/Brighton-Rehabilitation-and-Wellness-Center-criminal-neglect-PA-AG-Josh-Shapiro/stories/202008120163?cid=search" target="_blank">repeat of Brighton </a>coming and they didn’t want it to get out,” Mr. Gorzelsky said. “We just don’t know.”</p>
<p>Asked to respond to the lawsuit, the owners through a spokesman wrote only: “While we cannot comment on pending litigation, we are proud of those heroes who selflessly cared for the great generation we service throughout a pandemic.”</p>
<p>Though the outbreak at Monroeville has not been as pervasive as Brighton’s — which has had the state’s worst COVID-19 outbreak with 332 of its 460 residents testing positive, and 82 of them dying, in addition to 115 cases among staff — it has been one of the worst among Allegheny County’s 61 nursing homes. Fifty-nine of Monroeville’s 111 residents tested positive and 11 of them died. Twenty staff members tested positive.</p>
<p>The data on cases at Monroeville seemed haphazard after their first case was indicated in the weekly state data report on long term care facilities on July 7.&nbsp;In that report, Monroeville reported it only had four or fewer positive cases among staff — a figure the state indicates by placing an asterisk in the data.</p>
<p>The facility’s staff cases jumped to five on July 14, along with cases reported for the first time — nine total — among residents, and four or fewer resident deaths.</p>
<p>But then on July 20, the number of resident cases dropped to four or fewer, as did the number of staff cases. Then, on July 27, the number of resident cases jump back up to seven. And then all three categories were reported as zero cases on August 4, a few days after Mr. Berlingo was fired.</p>
<p>After the next state data report on Aug. 10, when cases among residents jumped to 47 with seven deaths, and zero cases were reported among staff, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/08/12/COVID-19-pittsburgh-pennsylvania-allegheny-county-data-deaths-cases-pandemic/stories/202008120124?cid=search" target="_blank">the facility’s administration wrote in an email</a>&nbsp;to reporters,&nbsp;in part: “On August 4, case reporting was briefly delayed due to an issue in receiving the correct login information following a change of administrators. Officials were aware of this issue and it has since been corrected. While we are continuing to take every precaution, we remain cautiously optimistic that we have turned a corner.”</p>
<p>Mr. Gorzelsky said that Mr. Berlingo did get a call a couple days after he was fired asking for his password login. But that does not explain why the figures increased and decreased depending on the week. The facility’s spokesman would not respond to questions about that issue.</p>
<p>The lawsuit seems to indicate that the reporting to the state database was the responsibility of Ms. Poremba, the director of nursing. But Mr. Gorzelsky said Mr. Berlingo was not sure how that was handled exactly.</p>
<p>Mr. Berlingo claims in the lawsuit that both Mr. Lowden and Ms. Poremba had, at various times in July, given Ms. Hebden inaccurate information about the true number of staff members who were out sick with COVID-19, how many residents had COVID-19, and falsely claimed that the facility was working with an epidemiologist to control the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Ms. Hebden is listed in the lawsuit as working with Allegheny County. But Amie Downs, the county’s spokeswoman, said Ms. Hebden is a contractor working for the state Department of Health.</p>
<p>At one point, later in July, after Ms. Poremba had not completed the required weekly “line listing” for the state on COVID-19 case information, Mr. Berlingo called the state by himself to ask for an extension of time.</p>
<p>When Mr. Lowden found out, he “once against reprimanded Mr. Berlingo, informing him that he is not to speak to the state without attorneys present,” and that he was not to talk on the weekly conference calls with Ms. Hebden, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Mr. Lowden “also informed Mr. Berlingo that the owner, Sam Halper, was not pleased with Mr. Berlingo’s performance and was looking to replace him,” the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p>Mr. Halper is also the managing owner, along with Ephram “Mordy” Lahasky, of the Brighton facility. Both men also are listed as owners among a group of investors for Monroeville and a number of other nursing homes across the state.</p>
<p>None of the representatives from Monroeville — Mr. Halper, Mr. Lahasky, Mr. Lowden, or Ms. Poremba — responded to messages left for them Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Berlingo is asking for damages, including back pay and punitive damages, in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, Mr. Berlingo was determined for making a good-faith report to Ms. Hebden regarding what he perceived to be inaccurate information that had been provided,” the lawsuit concludes. “The Defendant’s action in the midst of a pandemic is willful, malicious conduct that displays a wanton disregard for the safety of others.”</p>
