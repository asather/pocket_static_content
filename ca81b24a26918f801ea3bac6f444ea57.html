<h1>Bad start costly for Panthers in loss to Miami</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CORAL GABLES, Fla. — For the Pitt Panthers, it was “Six Minutes of Hell” — twice.</p>
<p>The Panthers fell behind, 16-0, in the first six minutes of the game and got outscored, 15-4, to start the second half, also in six minutes.</p>
<p>In the end, the Panthers couldn’t overcome those dirty-dozen minutes, falling, 66-58, to the Miami Hurricanes Sunday night at Watsco Center.</p>
<p>Pitt (11-5, 2-3 ACC) was led by Trey McGowens, who had 18 points and a game-high seven assists. Terrell Brown added 10 points off the bench, but those were the Panthers’ only two double-figure scorers.</p>
<p>“We had no energy,” Brown said. “We were complacent. There was no talking. We have to be ready in warm-ups. I saw it in warm-ups. I tried to talk to people. But it’s something players have to take into account on their own.”</p>
<p>Pitt’s Justin Champagnie was held to eight points — he was averaging 11.7 — but he showed life on the boards, grabbing a game-high 11 rebounds, including six on the offensive glass.</p>
<p>Still, McGowens saw the same thing as Brown.</p>
<p>“I kept trying to get our energy up, but it wasn’t reaching the team,” McGowens said. “That’s on us. We have to look ourselves in the mirror.”</p>
<p>Miami (10-5, 2-3) has beaten Pitt seven consecutive times. That’s Miami’s longest streak against any ACC school.</p>
<p>The Hurricanes, who led by as many as 20 points and never trailed, got a game-high 19 points from Kam McGusty.</p>
<p>Miami entered in a vulnerable condition that perhaps should’ve created an opportunity for Pitt.</p>
<p>The Hurricanes were down to just eight scholarship players due to the injuries that have parked power forwards Deng Gak and Keith Stone. In addition, Miami guard Harlond Beverley played despite back spasms, and forward Sam Waardenburg played despite knee tendinitis.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem for Miami occurred when junior point guard Chris Lykes fouled out with 8:09 left in the second half. He managed 12 points and 4 assists in 19 minutes, fouling out for the first time in his career.</p>
<p>Miami has no other expert ballhandler, and the Panthers exploited that issue, getting 19 points off 16 Hurricanes turnovers.</p>
<p>The Panthers got as close as a four points down the stretch, trailing, 57-53, with 3:16 left. But Miami answered with a Waardenburg layup, and the Panthers never got that close again.</p>
<p>“We dug a hole so deep, we couldn’t climb out,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “We had to expend more energy because it was such a deep climb, and we didn’t do what was required to win. We didn’t move the ball. We weren’t connected.”</p>
<p>The loss was extra painful for the Panthers, who are playing well overall, winning nine of their past 12 games. In that stretch, other than a decisive loss to 13th-ranked Louisville, the other two defeats will surely frustrate Pitt fans. There was the loss in which the Panthers blew a 16-point lead at home to Wake Forest … and this clunker at Miami.</p>
<p>If there was good news for Pitt, it was the return of sophomore wing Au’diese Toney, who had missed the previous two games due to a left elbow injury. He scored nine points.</p>
<p>But when Hurricanes guard Dejan Vasiljevic banked in a 3-pointer in the second half, it was clear that this was not Pitt’s night. Vasiljevic had 13 points, and Waardenburg grabbed 10 rebounds.</p>
<p>Pitt shot 35.9 percent for the game, including 3 of 16 on 3-pointers (18.8 percent). Miami shot 52.9 percent, including 6 for 24 on 3-pointers (25.0 percent).</p>
<p>Brown said Pitt’s previous game — a big road win at North Carolina — allowed for some complacency.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t … but it did,” Brown said. “It all started because [Miami] went on a run in the first [six] minutes. It’s the ACC — any team will capitalize if you don’t come to play.”</p>
<p>That early malaise featured Pitt shooting 0 for 7 with four turnovers to start the game. It took the Panthers more than six minutes — 6:12 to be exact — to get its first points, on two free throws by Xavier Johnson.</p>
<p>Pitt came back and tied the score at 18-18 with 9:24 left in the half. But the Panthers were never able to grab the lead, and Miami finished the half with a 31-22 advantage.</p>
<p>The Hurricanes started the second half much like the first, building their lead back up to 16 at 40-24.</p>
<p>After Lykes went out, Pitt had hope, if only briefly.</p>
<p>“We were trying to attack,” McGowens said. “We wanted to move and make them play us. But we didn’t make the right plays.</p>
<p>“It’s most definitely [frustrating]. Nobody likes to lose.”</p>
