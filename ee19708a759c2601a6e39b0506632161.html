<p>Despite playing him sparingly in the second half of last season, the&nbsp;Penguins announced Saturday that they’ve signed Juuso Riikola to a two-year deal.</p>
<p>The left-shot defenseman’s contract, which runs through the 2021-22 season, will have an average annual value of $1.15 million — a slight raise for the Finn.</p>
<p>“When he is on his game, Juuso has shown the ability to be a solid contributor for our team,” general manager Jim Rutherford said of the restricted free agent. “We feel he is going to take the next step forward in his development.”</p>
<p>How often is Riikola on his game, though? It’s a question worth exploring.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old played 36 games last season. He was asked to be a winger in four of those games due to injuries and a tight salary cap situation. The Penguins played Zach Trotman, a righty, over him down the stretch. Riikola did not suit up in the playoffs even though the third pair struggled against Montreal.</p>
<p>Advanced statistics that are publicly available suggest Riikola made a positive impact last season. The Penguins generated 59.1% of the high-danger chances with Riikola on the ice at 5-on-5. That led all Pittsburgh defensemen.</p>
<p>But the coaching staff didn’t show much faith in him, perhaps because of major mental lapses like the one he had Feb. 20 when he drifted into no-man’s land in the neutral zone in a loss to Toronto. Out of position, Riikola let Kaspari Kapanen, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/08/25/kasperi-kapanen-trade-penguins-maple-leafs/stories/202008250091" target="_blank">his new Penguins teammate</a>, sneak behind him for a breakaway goal.</p>
<p>Someone wanted Riikola and his big shot and plus skating back in Pittsburgh. He will enter training camp as a candidate to play on the left side in the third pair. For now, Jack Johnson and his $3.25 million salary remain on the squad. Prospect P.O. Joseph will also be given an opportunity to compete for a spot.</p>
<p>Riikola had a goal, six assists and a plus-3 rating last season. In two seasons with Pittsburgh, he has dressed in 73 games, tallying three goals, 12 points and a plus-6 rating. The Penguins had a 43-21-9 record in those games, though he wasn’t among the primary reasons for the team success.</p>
