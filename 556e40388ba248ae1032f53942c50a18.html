<h1>Paul Zeise: Steelers took a good first step toward defensive stability by signing Cam Heyward</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cam Heyward was the first step for the Steelers’ front office in the quest to lock up their defensive stars long term for the next few years. It was key for the Steelers to get Heyward under contract because he is such an important piece of their puzzle.</p>
<p>Heyward isn’t easily replaced and, more importantly, there isn’t really anyone to replace him waiting in the wings. He can be a dominant player at times, but he is also a steady and consistent producer even when he isn’t wrecking offensive lines. He is a team leader and that’s why the Steelers were so eager to get him under contract.</p>
<p>The deal is a significant one. Heyward will be paid $75 million over five years. He is now the highest-paid defensive lineman older than 30 in the NFL. It is a much-earned extension for Heyward, but it is also just the first step for the Steelers’ defense.</p>
<p>I assume this deal means James Conner and JuJu Smith-Schuster will not be getting a second contract for the Steelers. Both are good players but they aren’t game-changers and they play positions to which the Steelers don’t have a history of giving big money extensions.</p>
<p>The Steelers also have bigger priorities for players on the defensive side of the ball. Kevin Colbert has said the Steelers would like to find a way to sign linebacker Bud Dupree to a long-term extension. That seems like it will be difficult to do given salary cap restraints, but he should be near the front of the line of Steelers stars who need to get paid, and he is certainly ahead of Conner and Smith-Schuster.</p>
<p>The top priority for the Steelers is TJ Watt and for obvious reasons. He is the Steelers’ best defensive player and one of the most dominant outside linebackers in the game. He is a player who is on track to be a Hall of Famer and could be the Steelers’ all-time leader in sacks by the time he is done.</p>
<p>He isn’t going to be cheap, though, as he plays a premium position — pass rusher — that a lot of the highest-paid players play. Myles Garrett just signed a $125 million dollar deal that pays him $25 million a year. Khalil Mack has a $140 million contract that pays him $23.5 million per year. Demarcus Lawrence got a $105 million contract and makes $21 million a year.</p>
<p>What does that mean for Watt? I don’t know for sure, other than to say he is going to make somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million per year and will get a contract extension of about $120 million. At least. And if he has another huge year and wins the Defensive Player of the Year award, that number likely goes up.</p>
<p>The Steelers have never shied away from paying for performance and always spend to the cap, so they will make something happen with Watt to make sure he is with them for a long time. It is going to take a lot of creative financing to get his deal under the cap, but they have always been able to figure it out.</p>
<p>One of the main obstacles is Ben Roethlisberger’s contract for next season. My guess is that if Roethlisberger has a good season and shows no signs of slowing down, he will get an extension so the Steelers can reduce the sting of his cap hit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like Watt will be taken care of next year, but the Steelers also will have to begin to work on Minkah Fitzpatrick, who will be entering his final season under contract. Fitzpatrick is a safety so he isn’t nearly as expensive as an edge rusher, but he will still need to get paid.</p>
<p>The Cardinals’ Budda Baker Is the highest-paid safety at $14.75 million per season.&nbsp;The Bears' Eddie Jackson ($14.6 million) is the second-highest-paid and the Titans’ Kevin Byard is third ($14.1 million). That is significantly less than Watt will make, but Fitzpatrick will be in that same category.</p>
<p>If you do the math of what the Steelers will be paying three players — about $56 million — it definitely will create some challenges. The Steelers have always been good at manipulating the cap, but this is going to get tricky. I believe they will do it because these three players are at the top of their priority list.</p>
<p>Signing Heyward was a great first step, but the Steelers now have a lot of work to do to make sure it isn’t the only step.</p>
