<h1>Riverhounds squander early lead in weather-delayed draw with Saint Louis FC</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What began as a picturesque late summer night Saturday at Highmark Stadium&nbsp;quickly turned into something more unsightly. Bolts of lighting that were once safely in the distance quickly moved west, bringing with them dark skies, gusts of wind and a torrential downpour.</p>
<p>It was a drastic and dreary turn that could have easily been taken as a metaphor. As calm and desirable as things appeared for Riverhounds SC — with a two-goal lead mere minutes before halftime, right before the rain began — trouble was on its way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it was a storm they literally weathered but figuratively didn’t.</p>
<p>Playing their third game in eight days and confronted with the awkwardness and rust of a nearly three-hour weather delay, the Riverhounds squandered that first half advantage, eventually drawing with Saint Louis FC, 2-2, in a match that ended four-and-a-half hours after it began.</p>
<p>“The first 15 minutes of the second half and the last five minutes of the first half cost us three points,” Riverhounds coach Bob Lilley said. “It’s tough.”</p>
<p>It was the first tie of the season for the Riverhounds, stalling a bit of the momentum they had created over the previous four games, a period in which they won three times while outscoring their opponents by a 10-2 margin. Saturday’s result moves them to 5-3-1 on the season. Their 16 points places them atop their group standings, though they’ve played three more matches than second-place Hartford Athletic, which heads into its game Sunday with 15 points and is, as Lilley put it after the game, “miles” ahead of his club in the standings, even if it doesn’t appear that way with a cursory glance.</p>
<p>It’s a cushion in the standings that was frustratingly close to being that much bigger.</p>
<p>Though they had possession for only 38% of the first half, the Riverhounds dictated the game’s rhythm relatively early with a pair of strikes that gave them a degree of control, regardless of how infrequently the ball was at their feet.</p>
<p>In the 16th minute, a careless touch and a well-timed slide tackle in the midfield led to a counterattack for the Riverhounds. They capitalized on that opportunity, as Ropapa Mensah buried a shot from within a few feet of the goal. That conversion snapped what had been an occasionally frustrating 2020 season to that point, as he had a team-high 13 shot attempts heading into Saturday but only two goals to show for it.</p>
<p>That advantage was doubled in the 40th minute, when the ball landed at the feet of Robbie Mertz at the center of the box. He took a touch to his left and deftly hit it with his left foot to the lower right corner of the goal, just beyond the reach of Saint Louis goalkeeper and former teammate Kyle Morton. It was the fourth goal of the season for the Upper St. Clair graduate.</p>
<p>Barely five minutes later, that lead was reduced back to one, when Saint Louis’ Kyle Greig put home a ball that came his way following a save from Riverhounds goalkeeper Tomas Gomez, a former St. Louis high school standout and Saint Louis FC player.</p>
<p>In the moment, it was a play that appeared consequential, turning what would have been a comfortable halftime advantage into a match that would become that much more unpredictable the rest of the night, especially on a wet field and with a slick ball that awaited the teams after several hours of unrelenting rain.</p>
<p>“We needed to get to half at 2-0,” Lilley said. “That was a big moment. They’re on the road. It kept them clearly in the game.”</p>
<p>In the early minutes of the second half, the effect of that late tally became painfully clear for the home side.</p>
<p>Saint Louis’ Todd Wharton was fouled just outside the box in the 57th minute, setting up his teammate, Wal Fall, with an extremely favorable setup for a free kick. Fall didn’t waste the chance he was given, clearing the top of the Riverhounds’ wall by an inch or two with a firm, bending strike that quickly dipped and sneaked inside the near post to level the score.</p>
<p>In the match’s final minutes, with both teams desperately seeking a late and decisive edge, both Saint Louis and the Riverhounds had chances, from Kenardo Forbes’ left-footed shot from the middle of the box that was headed for the corner before a diving Morton got his fingertips on it to Saint Louis’ Russell Cicerone ripping a shot that hit the bottom of the crossbar and was eventually cleared out.</p>
<p>Those initiatives, close as they were, proved to be fruitless, unable to break an obstinate stalemate.</p>
<p>It was, as is the case with virtually any draw, an unsatisfying result. But with the way it transpired and with an abbreviated schedule giving any contending USL Championship team less room for the kind of mistakes that were showcased Saturday night, it left the Riverhounds longing for more and wondering, had they been better, what what might have been.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’re too far away from where we want to be,” Lilley said. “It’s disappointing without that little bit of extra composure on the ball and decision-making. I think it played into their hands.”</p>
