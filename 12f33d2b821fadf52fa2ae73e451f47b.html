<h1>Ticketmaster refund policy reportedly changes due to pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With millions of Americans out of a job due to the coronavirus pandemic, many are seeking relief anywhere they can get it -- from government-issued stimulus checks and unemployment benefits to cutting back on expenses or getting their money back on tickets for concerts that are rescheduled or postponed. And the latter is proving to be difficult.</p>
<p>That’s because Ticketmaster quietly changed its refund policy about four weeks ago, according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>Screenshots shared by The New York Times show Ticketmaster, owned by concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment, show refunds were available as of March 13 “if an event is postponed, rescheduled or canceled.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>On March 14, the refund policy page’s language changed to say “refunds are available if your event is canceled.” If an event is canceled, fans get their refund within 30 days -- but if it’s indefinitely postponed, it’s unclear when or if they’ll be able to get their money back.</p>
<p>The change comes as more than 20,000 concerts and festivals have been canceled, postponed or rescheduled due to social distancing guidelines forcing large events to shut down. And it’s still unclear if summer concerts, including at Live Nation venues like the St. Joseph’s Health Amphitheater at Lakeview in Syracuse and the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, will go on. Some artists have already been canceled shows, such as Zac Brown Band, while others wait to make a decision.</p>
<p>“In the past, with a routine volume of event interruptions, we and our event organizers have been able to consistently offer more flexibility with refunds for postponed and rescheduled events,” Ticketmaster said in a statement. “However, considering the currently unprecedented volume of affected events, we are focused on supporting organizers as they work to determine venue availability, new dates and refund policies, while rescheduling thousands of events in what continues to be an evolving situation.”</p>
<p>Pollstar reports StubHub, one of the nation’s largest ticket resellers, has also changed its refund policy, which previously offered refunds before recovering charges from sellers. Now customers will instead receive a 12-month coupon worth 120% of the ticket’s original value.</p>
<p>“We are facing significant timing delays in recouping funds from the thousands of sellers on our platform, and expect these challenges to continue in the coming months,” StubHub president Sukhinder Singh Cassidy wrote in a March 27 email to customers.</p>
<p>According to the Times, the concert industry could lose $9 billion if shows don’t resume until 2021. That number would be even larger for canceled sports events, such as NBA, MLB, NHL and NFL games, which are all in limbo; the Summer Olympics in Tokyo have already been rescheduled for next year.</p>
<p>The New York State Attorney General’s office told the newspaper that it’s received thousands of consumer complaints related to coronavirus, but only 10 as of early April were related to tickets. More complaints are likely soon as “Ticketmaster” became a trending topic on Monday as fans shared their outrage.</p>
<p>“If you pay for something and don’t receive it, someone is stealing from you. They are taking funds for an event that never took place. This isn’t like when a store has a “no return policy”. Ticketmaster finna have hella lawsuits,” one Twitter user wrote.</p>
<p>“I dropped $500+ on tickets, I better be getting my money back,” another tweeted. “They charge $100+ in fees and do THIS? disgusting.”</p>
<p>“Ticketmaster time and time again has demonstrated that they are the absolute scum of the music industry, it’s absolutely f---ed these clowns have a monopoly over so many tours and venues, I hope they go out of business,” another wrote.</p>
