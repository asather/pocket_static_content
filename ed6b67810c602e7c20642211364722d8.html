<h1>TV Q&amp;A: Where to find '24' and 'Northern Exposure'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>You have questions. I have some answers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I am guessing "Grand Hotel" isn't coming back even though they left us hanging! I miss that show! Also, is "A Million Little Things" coming back?</strong></p>
<p>A: One of the drawbacks to the serialization of so many TV shows is that cancellation may leave cliffhangers unresolved. That's the case with "Grand Hotel," which ABC ended in 2019. As for "A Million Little Things," it is indeed returning. Look for new episodes beginning Nov. 19.</p>
<p>The cancellation of ABC's "Grand Hotel," featuring Demián Bichir and Roselyn Sanchez, leaves unresolved questions for followers of the Miami Beach-set series.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I loved the TV show "Wayward Pines" that ended abruptly about three years ago with no indication of its return. Do you know anything about this show?</strong></p>
<p>A: I know that it aired for two 10-episode seasons on Fox in 2015-16, that it was a weird blend of mystery and fantasy derived from a series of novels by Blake Crouch and it had thriller writer-director M. Night Shyamalan among the people behind it. The cast was also impressive, including Terence Howard, Hope Davis, Melissa Leo and more. But the response was mixed and a third season has not happened. Still, you can revisit the two seasons on Hulu.</p>
<p>Although "24" has had no new seasons since 2017, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) can still be found "running point" as a federal agent hunting down terrorist threats on the streaming service Hulu.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you know if all episodes of "24" with Kiefer Sutherland are available on any of the streaming services?</strong></p>
<p>A: Hulu has the nine seasons with Sutherland, the eight from its initial run in 2001-2010 and the ninth-season revival in 2014 also known as "24: Live Another Day." In addition, Hulu has the 2017 spinoff "24: Legacy" starring Corey Hawkins.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is WWE wrestler John Morrison related to the late rocker Jim Morrison?</strong></p>
<p>A: It might seem that way since one DVD about the wrestler is called "John Morrison: Rock Star." But as far as I can find he is not related to the Doors' lead singer. For one thing, John Morrison's given name is John Hennigan; he has used that name in some of his show-business efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I have fond memories of the series "Northern Exposure." I have never seen reruns of it and am wondering why and if it ever will be shown again?</strong></p>
<p>A: The show is loved and, as I mentioned a couple of months ago, star Rob Morrow has been trying for years to relaunch the series. But apparently it is unseen over the air or streaming because of music rights problems. As you may recall, the show used a lot of pop music; it doesn't get that for free, and sometimes studios are not willing to keep paying for the tunes. Other (often inferior) music gets substituted, and — as several reports over the years have indicated — the show's creators do not want it seen that way. As for home video, the first set of DVDs of the series from Universal Home Entertainment had the dreaded music substitutions. I then contacted Shout! Factory, which now distributes a DVD set of "Northern Exposure" and has done nice music-restoring work on shows including "WKRP in Cincinnati." But I was told "We did not restore any original music that was not already included in the prior Universal DVD release."</p>
<p><strong>Q: There was a comedy/variety/skit show which aired on ABC from 1977-1978 called the "Redd Foxx Comedy Hour" with Redd and various guest stars. This was before the "Sanford and Son" days and it was absolutely great and hilarious. I would like to find the show on a DVD set, but I am having no luck. Would you have any information on where it may be available?</strong></p>
<p>A: First, a timeline. Redd Foxx had been starring in "Sanford and Son" since 1972 on NBC when he left the comedy to host variety show on ABC. It did not catch on, only airing from September 1977 to January 1978; it was not a success, to which one producer said, "Thank goodness." I do not know of an authorized DVD of the show but did see one episode on YouTube.</p>
<p>By the way, when Foxx left "Sanford and Son," co-star Demond Wilson did likewise (reportedly in a contract dispute). NBC retooled the show as "Sanford Arms" in the fall of 1977 but it failed within a month. Foxx returned to his old character in the comedy "Sanford" for NBC in 1980, but it was not a success either, ending in 1981.</p>

<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said he is disappointed his team’s Week 4 game against the Tennessee has been postponed until later in the season because of further positive COVID-19 tests within the Titans organization.</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed because we were planning to play and we’re not getting the opportunity to,” Tomlin said.</p>
<p>The NFL announced the postponement — the first regular season postponement during the coronavirus pandemic —&nbsp;Thursday morning and has not yet announced a date for the rescheduled game, though it’s possible it could be Oct. 25. The decision to postpone the game between two unbeaten teams was made after one additional Titans player and another personnel member tested positive for the virus, one day after the league said the game would be played Monday or Tuesday after positive tests earlier in the week. The Titans facility will remain closed until further notice.</p>
<p>“There is disappointment, no question,” Tomlin said after a shortened practice on the South Side. “We worked extremely hard for what we thought was an opportunity against an undefeated team in their venue.”</p>
<p>It is still unclear how the league will handle the Steelers schedule and if this week will be considered their bye week instead of the original Nov. 1 date.</p>
<p>If the Steelers and Titans are rescheduled for Oct. 25, which is Tennessee’s original off week, that means the Steelers’ game at the Baltimore Ravens that day will be moved to Nov. 1. The Steelers and Ravens are each scheduled to be off Nov. 1.</p>
<p>It also means the Steelers and Titans — teams with playoff intentions — would not get a break the rest of the regular season.</p>
<p>“We’ll make the best of that, get the appropriate rest and, more than anything, gaining a little perspective in terms of watching others work,” Tomlin said.</p>
<p>When asked about playing 13 consecutive weeks -—and possibly more — Tomlin said abruptly, “We do not care.”</p>
<p>With the postponement of the Titans game to a later date, the Steelers, who play the Eagles on Oct. 11 and the Browns on Oct. 18 at Heinz Field, will now have four consecutive games at home for the first time since at least the 1970 AFL/NFL merger.</p>
<p>With the two new cases announced Thursday, the Titans now have 11 positive test results: five players and six other organization members. That doesn’t include outside linebackers coach Shane Bowen, whose positive result came back last Saturday and prevented him from traveling to Tennessee’s 31-30 win at the Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Titans (3-0) placed three players on the reserve/COVID-19 list, including key players defensive captain and lineman DaQuan Jones and long snapper Beau Brinkley. Outside linebacker Kamalei Correa became the fourth on that list Wednesday.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, teams in an idle week have to give players four consecutive days off, according to the league’s agreement with the players union. After Thursday’s shortened practice, Tomlin said Steelers players will be off the remainder of the week and will use Monday as a bonus day.</p>
<p>All-Pro defensive end Cam Heyward, the team’s player representative, tweeted earlier in the day to the NFL and NFLPA, “Man, is this a bye week or not?”</p>
<p>The Steelers do not warmly welcome a bye this early in the season for several reasons. One, they have won three games in a row and don’t want to disrupt an early-season roll. Secondly, no teams wants an off week this early in the season, particularly a team that has intentions of playing longer into the postseason.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, this season’s expanded playoff format means that only one team — the No. 1 seed in each conference — gets a bye in the postseason. It was two in previous years.</p>
<p>But there is also the possibility the league could add an 18th week to the end of the regular season — something that has been discussed — to accommodate situations such as this.</p>
<p>“It’s not a lack of understanding,” Tomlin said. “It’s just that we live in these seven-day cycles and we had a game scheduled. We were readying ourselves for the opportunity [and] we’re not getting it, so it is a letdown.”</p>
<p>Also, unlike past years, players and coaches cannot leave town during the off week under league rules. They still have to be tested daily through the weekend at the team’s South Side facility.</p>
<p>“Guys have to remain local,” Tomlin said. “We understand that, and we plan to adhere to it.”</p>
