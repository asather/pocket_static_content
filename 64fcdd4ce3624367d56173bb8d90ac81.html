<p>As expected by state health experts, the number of deaths and COVID-19 cases spiked Tuesday, according to the latest numbers released by the state health department.</p>
<p>After two days of zero deaths, Allegheny County said it had seven new deaths and 10 cases related to COVID-19, according to the latest figures released Tuesday. Other deaths were reported in other Western Pennsylvania counties, including five in Beaver, and once each in Armstrong, Indiana, and Lawrence.</p>
<p>Statewide, nursing home deaths also saw a large increase over Monday’s total, with 383 new deaths, including 14 in Western Pennsylvania — seven in Allegheny County, five in Beaver County, one in Armstrong County and one in Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>The state reported 554 new deaths for a total of 3,012. On Monday, the state had reported just 14 deaths.</p>
<p>“Usually, Tuesday is a higher number,” Dr. Levine said at her daily press conference on Monday. “So, we will see (Tuesday) if the trend of decreasing continues, or if it rises. Changes over time are the most important thing to watch for.”</p>
<p>The sate said it has 50,957 cases of COVID-19, up 865 from the previous day.</p>
<p>With the new data, Allegheny has 1,375 total cases and 109 deaths since the first case was announced on March 14, the highest totals in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Of the cases, 1,317 are confirmed and 58 are probable. Of the deaths, 99 are confirmed and 10 are probable. Through Tuesday, there have been 244 hospitalizations in the county. Of them, 106 needed to visit the intensive care unit and 62 required mechanical ventilation. So far, the county has performed 18,873 tests.</p>
<p>The Glen Hazel Community Living Center, operated by Kane Community Living Centers and Allegheny County, is now reporting 12 deaths from COVID-19, up from 10 last week.</p>
<p>Statewide, the case count on Monday eclipsed the 50,000 mark with 825 new reported cases, but there were only 14 new deaths reported. Eleven of them occurred at nursing or assisted living facilities. State Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine, too, cautioned that weekend data does not always reflect the full picture.</p>

<p>“Usually, Tuesday is a higher number,” Dr. Levine said at her daily press conference. “So, we will see tomorrow if the trend of decreasing continues, or if it rises. Changes over time are the most important thing to watch for.”</p>
<p>The only county in Western Pennsylvania to report a death on Monday was Westmoreland, where its coroner reported one. Of Westmoreland’s 31 deaths, the office said 17 were female and 14 were male. All of the victims were white.</p>
<p>Philadelphia County continues to have the highest totals in the state with 13,563 cases and 627 deaths. On Tuesday, its number of deaths spiked more than 200 over Monday’s total.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Monday’s report said 9,345 of the statewide cases are in long-term care living facilities. Responding to requests by counties to consider cases in nursing homes separately from the rest of a county’s cases when making decisions about reopening, Dr. Levine said that the department would not do so.</strong></p>
<p>“What we have certainly learned from this global pandemic of COVID-19 is that we are all interconnected,” Dr. Levine said. “One section of our community, such as a nursing home or personal care home, impacts the whole community.”</p>
<p>Dr. Levine said that the state continues to evaluate counties and regions for potential reopening, and that the department receives new data on a variety of metrics every Tuesday and Thursday. In combination with information about testing and contact tracing capacity and Carnegie Mellon University’s models, that data is presented to the governor, who then makes the final call, Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>Additionally, further guidance is expected this week regarding the reopening of dental care facilities, Dr. Levine said.</p>
