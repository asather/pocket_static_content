<h1>Excela Health reports strong financials ahead of competing hospital opening</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Greensburg-based hospital system Excela Health reported strong financials between July and December, eight weeks before a competing hospital opened 2 miles away.</p>
<p>Operating revenue for the six months ending Dec. 31 rose $20.3 million or 7.1% to $307.7 million when compared to a year ago, primarily due to “unusually strong inpatient volume,” the Westmoreland County health system reported.</p>
<p>Juicing results was $3 million in new value-based revenue from Highmark’s Quality Blue program, which rewards medical providers for meeting quality of care metrics, including limiting the number of avoidable hospital readmissions.</p>
<p>“It’s been an all-out team effort across the board,” CEO John Sphon said Wednesday. “We don’t want people leaving this service area to get care elsewhere.”</p>
<p>For years, Excela has been plagued with the problem of patients seeking medical care outside the system, which is sometimes called patient leakage. Based on year-old figures, an average of 46% of patients in Excela’s service area of 350,000 people have bypassed its doctors and hospitals for treatment, Mr. Sphon said.</p>
<p>Adding to the competition, Highmark’s Allegheny Health Network opened a 10-bed hospital off Route 30 in Hempfield on Feb. 3, competing for patients with Excela’s flagship Westmoreland Hospital 2 miles away.</p>
<p>Mr. Sphon said it is still early, but Excela has not seen any impact on its operations from the rival hospital.</p>
<p>Despite competitive pressures in Westmoreland County from both AHN and UPMC,&nbsp;Excela was open to collaboration with either Pittsburgh health care giant “where it makes sense.” None of those opportunities have arisen, Mr. Sphon said, noting that Excela is continuing to focus on developing a strategic plan, recruiting doctors and expanding services to meet community needs.</p>
<p>Mr. Sphon was named interim CEO of the three-hospital system in April and his appointment was made permanent in December.</p>
<p>Operating income for the six months was $2.6 million for a razor thin 0.8% operating margin, which compares to an operating loss of nearly $5 million and an operating loss of 1.7% a year earlier.</p>
<p>Patient census fell to 50% for the period from 62.7% in 2019 as the number of staffed beds rose to 535 from 427.</p>
<p>While open heart operations and catheterization procedures were virtually flat during the six months compared to a year ago, Excela CFO Tom Albanesi said the July-to-December figures didn’t reflect the fact that almost no heart operations were done in July and August due to physician departures.</p>
<p>In the fall, Excela added two interventional cardiologists and two cardiothoracic surgeons, allowing new heart valve repair procedures to be performed and boosting hospital admissions.</p>
<p>“Our open heart program is booming,” Mr. Albanesi said. “There’s a real positive vibe going on at Excela.”</p>
