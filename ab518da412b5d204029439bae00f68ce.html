<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded $2.8 million to 43 health centers in Pennsylvania to battle coronavirus.</p>
<p>The money is to be used for screening and testing, acquiring medical supplies and boosting telehealth capacity.</p>

<p>HHS said the HRSA-funded centers provide primary care for 28 million people in the U.S.</p>
<p>The awarded money includes $61,000 for East Liberty Family Health Care Center, $53,000 to Community Health Clinic in New Kensington, $53,000 for North Side Christian Health Center, $64,000 for Primary Care Health Services in Pittsburgh, $59,000 for Squirrel Hill Health Center and $53,000 for Sto-Rox Neighborhood Health Council in McKees Rocks.</p>
