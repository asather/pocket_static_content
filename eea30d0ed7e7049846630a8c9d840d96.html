<h1>With restaurants open, diners flood — and trickle — back in</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was the day that many restau­ra­teurs had been wait­ing for. The switch to the green phase of COVID-19 guide­lines meant Western Penn­syl­va­nia restau­rants could re­open for dine-in ser­vice. That per­mis­sion came with re­quired safety pro­to­cols, such as a 50% oc­cu­pancy limit, man­da­tory masks for em­ploy­ees and ex­tra san­i­ta­tion. Vis­its to restau­rants across the re­gion found din­ers re­turn­ing, some ea­ger and some with hes­i­ta­tion.</p>
<p><strong>LOCALLY OWNED</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fam­ily Tra­di­tion Res­tau­rant</strong></p>
<p>Fam­ily Tra­di­tion in Har­ris­ville re­opened for dine-in when But­ler County tran­si­tioned to the green phase June 5. But in­stead of start­ing back up at 50% ca­pac­ity, the fam­ily-style restau­rant es­sen­tially re­turned to nor­mal op­er­a­tions.</p>
<p>“I told cus­tom­ers, ‘The only thing I’m go­ing to fol­low in the guide­lines is that I’m go­ing to go heavy on san­i­ta­tion,’” said owner David Carr. “I’m not do­ing any so­cial dis­tanc­ing, I’m not wear­ing a mask. I don’t re­quire my cus­tom­ers to wear a mask. I don’t re­quire my em­ploy­ees to wear a mask.”</p>
<p>Mr. Carr says he hasn’t heard a sin­gle com­plaint about how the restau­rant is op­er­at­ing. Busi­ness “came back strong,” and cus­tom­ers have thanked him for of­fer­ing a “nor­mal” din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, he said.</p>
<p>“[My cus­tom­ers] were just sick and tired of the gov­ern­ment put­ting the hand­cuffs on. They wanted some nor­mal­ity back in their lives.”</p>
<p>Roxi Mur­taugh, 67, and Barb Gen­tile, 63, live in Flor­ida but spend each sum­mer in Ven­ango County. Both women were sur­prised that Fam­ily Tra­di­tion’s wait­staff wasn’t wear­ing masks and that the ta­bles weren’t spaced far­ther apart. Com­pared to restau­rants in Flor­ida, they said Fam­ily Tra­di­tion was much more “le­nient.”</p>
<p>“But I’m cer­tainly en­joy­ing my meal, so I must not be too con­cerned about it,” Ms. Mur­taugh said.</p>
<p><strong>Tapped Brick Oven &amp; Pour House</strong></p>
<p>Tapped Brick Oven in Greens­burg is open for in­door din­ing but has turned peo­ple away due to lack of space.</p>
<p>“It’s tough be­cause on one hand, this is the busi­ness that we love and that we got into and want to see thrive, but we also have a duty to the pub­lic, to our cus­tom­ers, to our em­ploy­ees to do the right thing,” said owner Eric Jones. “While we would love to be open 100% and in­vite ev­ery­body in, we’re still try­ing to be mind­ful of the guide­lines.”</p>
<p>They say most cus­tom­ers have been good about wear­ing masks and re­spect­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing, but they have had to re­mind peo­ple not to stand around the bar. Their bus­i­est time for the past few weeks has been noon.</p>
<p>“Take­out was awe­some when we were closed. That re­ally got us through,” Mr. Jones said. “As dine in has come back, those take­out or­ders have dropped slightly.”</p>
<p><strong>When Pigs Fly 1</strong></p>
<p>When Pigs Fly 1, a bar­be­cue restau­rant in But­ler, is sticking with take­out right now. There are pic­nic ta­bles out­side, which lo­cal base­ball teams have used be­fore or af­ter a game, but take­out is the most pop­u­lar op­tion.</p>
<p>“I won’t feel com­fort­able open­ing up un­til I see way lower num­bers than I have of new cases and the death rate,” said owner and for­mer Veter­ans Af­fairs nurse David Cook.</p>
<p>He and his wife closed the restau­rant for the first two months of the pan­demic be­cause a re­cent sur­gery had weak­ened his im­mune sys­tem. They’ve only re­cently opened for take­out.</p>
<p>“The com­mu­nity has re­ally made a great push in sup­port­ing small busi­nesses, so ac­tu­ally we have been do­ing great since we re­opened,” Mr. Cook said.</p>
<p>He re­quires masks for the take­out win­dow and has turned peo­ple away for not wear­ing one.</p>
<p>“They don’t take it se­ri­ously enough,” he said about those who don’t wear masks. “They’re fol­low­ing the gov­ern­ment’s lead or the pres­i­dent’s lead, which is just as­i­nine.”</p>
<p><strong>C &amp; D’s Kitchen</strong></p>
<p>Nine months ago, Cletus and De­n­ise Hel­ton moved their soul food restau­rant, C &amp; D’s Kitchen, to a new lo­ca­tion in Ha­zel­wood be­cause their old spot, blocks away, didn’t allow in­door seat­ing. In the last three months, that seat­ing has been mostly empty.</p>
<p>“The peo­ple are still a lit­tle afraid to be out to eat,” said Mr. Hel­ton. “It’s not yet like it was be­fore.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Hel­ton un­der­stands. “Me per­son­ally, I re­ally don’t even want to go green, be­cause I’m not com­fort­able with it. For the most part we don’t en­cour­age it. We don’t shun it ei­ther.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hel­ton said that he and his wife are both in their 60s and have health con­di­tions that could make them high-risk. As of Mon­day, Mr. Hel­ton still hadn’t got­ten around to eras­ing a board in the front of the restau­rant that said “Take­out Only.”</p>
<p>Most of his sit-down traf­fic comes in the morn­ing, he said, when res­i­dents of a se­nior liv­ing fa­cil­ity a block away walk over for their morn­ing cof­fee. Since their full ca­pac­ity is only 30 peo­ple, they are limited to only 15 dine-in cus­tom­ers at a time. They ha­ven’t hit that yet, said Mr. Hel­ton, though they’ve been within one or two a cou­ple times.</p>
<p>With take­out sales re­main­ing strong, the Hel­tons say they’re do­ing 60-65% of the busi­ness that they were do­ing be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
<p>“Through the grace of God and my land­lord, we’ve been able to make it through,” he said. “We just have to pray and hope that it’s go­ing to work out for us.”</p>
<p><strong>Sun Dawg Cafe</strong></p>
<p>Since re­open­ing its in­door and out­door din­ing spaces June 5, Sun Dawg in Greensburg has seen a steady in­crease in cus­tom­ers each week. How­ever, owner Ray Flow­ers says busi­ness likely won’t re­turn to nor­mal un­til the 50% oc­cu­pancy re­stric­tion is re­laxed.</p>
<p>Sun Dawg’s waitstaff is re­quired to wear masks and cus­tom­ers are seated ac­cord­ing to so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines. Despite the pre­cau­tions, not ev­ery­one is com­fort­able din­ing inside, Mr. Flow­ers said. Take­out has re­mained pop­u­lar dur­ing the green phase.</p>
<p>“Some peo­ple are re­ally ex­cited and they come out, and then other peo­ple are still a lit­tle bit ner­vous.”</p>
<p>Jon­a­than Ewer, 47, sat with his wife, Dawn, 49, at an out­door ta­ble on Mon­day. It wasn’t the chiropractor’s first time eat­ing out since the pan­demic be­gan in March, and he ex­pressed lit­tle con­cern about con­tract­ing or spread­ing the vi­rus at a restau­rant.</p>
<p>“Chi­ro­prac­tic op­er­ates un­der the as­sump­tion that health comes from the in­side out,” Mr. Ewer said. “For five mil­len­nia, we’ve lived some­what har­mo­ni­ously with bac­te­ria, vi­ruses and dif­fer­ent germs.… The be­lief that we are sub­ser­vi­ent to a mi­cro­or­gan­ism is an ut­ter fal­lacy.”</p>
<p>Mr. Flow­ers said that his cus­tom­ers have been considerate of oth­ers. “Ev­ery­body is be­ing mind­ful. Some peo­ple are a lit­tle more lax with it, but I think they do take into con­sid­er­ation the peo­ple around them.”</p>
<p><strong>Mario’s Wood­fired Piz­ze­ria</strong></p>
<p>Two stain­less-steel con­tain­ers sit side by side next to the host­ess stand at Mario’s Wood­fired Piz­ze­ria in down­town Beaver. One is marked “San­itized Pens” and the other “Drop Used Pens Here.” It’s just one of many changes at the piz­ze­ria that Mario Fra­tan­geli has owned for 17 years.</p>
<p>Mario’s was not able to open up for dine-in ser­vice un­til June 12 be­cause Beaver County moved into the green phase a week later than the rest of Western Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
<p>“When we first opened up, it was slow,” he said. “We’re get­ting a lit­tle bet­ter.”</p>
<p>Mr. Fra­tan­geli has no trou­ble fill­ing his seven out­door ta­bles, he said, but traf­fic in­side is lower. At about 1 p.m. on Wed­nes­day, the restau­rant was about half full.</p>
<p>One of those ta­bles was oc­cu­pied by Howard Pflugh, a regular who was thrilled to re­turn to the din­ing room on the first day it opened. He said he and his wife eat in restau­rants twice a day.</p>
<p>Not­ing that he’s never had a flu shot, Mr. Pflugh said that he wasn’t con­cerned about con­tract­ing COVID-19 in a restau­rant. He doesn’t wear masks be­cause they ir­ri­tate his al­ler­gies, he said, in­form­ing a re­porter that her wear­ing one would break down her im­mune sys­tem.</p>
<p>Mr. Fra­tan­geli worries about the future, especially as this restaraunt and another he owns, Mario’s Dock­side Grille in Bridgewater, head into what is nor­mally their busy sum­mer sea­son.</p>
<p>“I’d like to know when we are go­ing to go into 100 per­cent,” he said. “This is the sea­son. This is when we make our bread and but­ter. This is our mon­ey­maker.”</p>
<p><strong>CHAIN RESTAURANTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eat’n Park</strong></p>
<p>Jack Mie­sel turned 85 on May 2. Since then, he and his wife, Patti, have been wait­ing to go out to a restau­rant to cel­e­brate. On Thurs­day, they joined their friend, Ruth Smith, who turned 87 in June, for a birth­day lunch in­side Eat’n Park in Banks­ville.</p>
<p>“We’ve been think­ing about it for 102 days,” laughed Mrs. Mie­sel, of Brookline.</p>
<p>They know that they are at risk for COVID-19 and have been closely watch­ing the guide­lines from the U.S. Centers for Dis­ease Con­trol. They have vis­ited with their chil­dren only out­side, and ha­ve cut back on activities other than vol­un­teer­ing weekly with Meals on Wheels.</p>
<p>They chose Eat’n Park be­cause they thought it would be safe and clean. They ar­rived at 11 a.m., hop­ing it wouldn’t be crowded. They got their wish.</p>
<p>“It was de­li­cious,” said Mrs. Mie­sel. “It was so nice to be able to be out.”</p>
<p>The restau­rant’s salad bar and some ta­bles were closed; many booths had new plex­iglass di­vid­ers be­tween them.</p>
<p>Sales at Eat’n Park are down about 30% from where they were last year, said Kevin O’Con­nell, chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer. Be­fore dine in be­came an op­tion on June 5, sales were down 55%. Take­out busi­ness is twice what it was at this time last year.</p>
<p>“There’s still a lot of peo­ple who want the restau­rant ex­pe­ri­ence and aren’t sure if they want to go into a restau­rant,” said Mr. O’Con­nell. “Con­sum­ers are in the ‘I’m not sure’ phase. Even if they are go­ing out, they’re not go­ing out as much as they used to.”</p>
<p><strong>Kings Fam­ily Res­tau­rant</strong></p>
<p>The Kings restau­rant in Canon­s­burg im­ple­mented sev­eral new pro­to­cols, in­clud­ing san­i­ta­tion sta­tions and al­low­ing seats at ev­ery other booth. Ev­ery­thing is wiped down and uten­sils are switched out ev­ery two hours, said as­sis­tant man­ager Da­nielle Har­rell. Em­ploy­ees must change gloves and wash hands ev­ery half hour.</p>
<p>“Def­i­nitely been chal­lenges with it, but as far as ev­ery­thing goes, busi­ness has been run­ning smooth. Cus­tom­ers have been re­ally un­der­stand­ing about ev­ery­thing,” she said.</p>
<p>Cus­tom­ers are asked to fill out a “health dec­la­ra­tion page” when they come into the restau­rant.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of hard ... be­cause you can only con­trol your em­ploy­ees. It’s kind of hard to con­trol the pub­lic,” Ms. Har­rell said.</p>
<p>They also en­cour­age pa­trons to wear masks but won’t turn some­one away if they don’t have one. If a cus­tomer comes in with­out a mask, they are of­fered one but they don’t have to wear it.</p>
<p>“We just try to get them to their seat as quick as pos­si­ble and not turn too much at­ten­tion to it” if someone isn’t wear­ing a mask, Ms. Har­rell said.</p>
<p>She says busi­ness is pick­ing up more day by day and that they are happy to be open again.</p>
<p><strong>El Campes­ino</strong></p>
<p>El Campes­ino, a small chain restaurant in McMurray, Washington County, shifted its op­er­a­tions and reduced the number of tables in the dining room to ad­here to the 50% ca­pac­ity re­stric­tion and al­low for so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
<p>“We re­spect the dis­tance,” said man­ager-in-train­ing Me­red­ith Open­brier. “It’s al­ready a small restau­rant, so at 50 per­cent, we don’t have much space for cus­tom­ers.”</p>
<p>Cus­tom­ers are asked to make a res­er­va­tion if they wish to dine in, and there is some­times a wait to sit down, par­tic­u­larly at the 6-8 p.m. din­ner rush.</p>
<p>Take­out has re­mained the most pop­u­lar choice in the three weeks the restau­rant has been open for in-per­son din­ing. El Campes­ino also de­liv­ers through UberEats and DoorDash.</p>
<p><strong>Panera Bread</strong></p>
<p>The Panera lo­ca­tions in Greens­burg and McMur­ray each had a few full ta­bles for lunch­time on Mon­day. Around half of the ta­bles were marked with signs di­rect­ing cus­tom­ers not to sit there.</p>
<p>Panera is pre­par­ing all or­ders to go re­gard­less of whether the cus­tomer chooses to dine in, said an employee who would not be identified. Cus­tom­ers who wish to avoid con­tact can still ar­range for curb­side pickup or de­liv­ery.</p>
<p>Joanne Has­nauer, 83, de­cided to meet at the Panera in Greens­burg with a friend who’d soon be leav­ing for Cal­i­for­nia. It was only her sec­ond time sit­ting down at a restau­rant since the pan­demic started in March.</p>
<p>Ms. Has­nauer says she’s wary of eat­ing at any restau­rant, re­gard­less of their pre­cau­tions against COVID-19.</p>
<p>“I still don’t feel com­fort­able,” she said. “It’s be­cause of my age.”</p>
