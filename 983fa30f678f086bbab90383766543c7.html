<h1>Weekend of events to culminate in Pride Parade and virtual live music</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>SisTers Pittsburgh and the Transgender Coalition of Pennsylvania are holding a weekend event that started Friday with an online healing and self-care workshop, an online awards ceremony Saturday and an in-person parade Sunday, followed by an online musical concert.</p>
<p>The concert features Shea Diamond and her band.</p>
<p>People can participate and find more information on Sisters Pgh’s Facebook page. Click on “events.” Or visit <a href="https://www.sisterspgh.org/" target="_blank">sisterspgh.org</a>.</p>
<p>The event is a substitute for the annual People’s Pride Parade, which is usually held in the summer. This parade will begin at 10 a.m. Sunday from Freedom Corner, at Centre Avenue and Crawford Street in the Lower Hill, and end at Lake Elizabeth in Allegheny Commons Park on the North Side.</p>
<p>SisTers founder and director Ciora Thomas said the online component was added due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The event —&nbsp;People’s Pride PGH: Black Trans Lives Matter Too —&nbsp;“will make our strong call to action to leaders in our city and state government to address the urgent needs of those most marginalized,” the organizers stated in an announcement about the event.</p>
<p>People’s Pride PGH was founded and is directed by Trans people of color and allies “to bolster the unapologetic approach needed to demand equal rights and visibility for our TLGBQIA+ [trans, lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, intersex and asexual] communities in Pittsburgh and around the country,” according to the group’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>“It is imperative that we get movement on statewide nondiscrimination protections, including a ban on panic defenses, hate crimes legislation, TLGBQIA+ community education, homelessness and poverty programs, meaningful employment opportunities, ending the violence against TLBTQIA+ people —&nbsp;particularly Black and brown trans women —&nbsp;and address so many other vital issues,” the announcement stated.</p>
<p>The organization also urges members of the TLGBQIA+ communities to advocate for themselves to have their voices heard and to actively work to have laws enacted that protect their communities.</p>
