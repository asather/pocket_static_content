<h1>Some state lawmakers split on moving Pennsylvania’s April 28 primary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the days since Gov. Tom Wolf floated the possibility of postponing the state’s April 28 primary election, Western Pennsylvania lawmakers have grappled with the consequences and implications of holding in-person voting in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Responding to inquiries from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Wednesday, three Allegheny County state legislators said they’d immediately support — or be open to supporting — a suspension of the primary, warning that voters might not want to congregate at polling places and that poll workers might not want to work.</p>
<p>Two other state lawmakers said they believe the election should be held as planned, encouraging people to vote by mail if they fear for their safety.</p>
<p>The conversation around postponing the state’s primary comes as other states that are scheduled to hold elections on April 28 consider their options in limiting person-to-person contact. Election officials in one of those states — New York — are discussing moving their primary from April 28 to June 23, according to the New York Times.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf, at a press conference earlier this week, noted that other states have already moved their primary elections and that “Pennsylvania is certainly taking that into consideration” because the state wants to keep people safe.</p>
<p>While the lawmakers in the Pittsburgh area universally encouraged mail-in voting, some offered more specific recommendations.</p>
<p>State Rep. Dan Deasy, a West End Democrat who is running unopposed in April, said he supports suspending the election — likely to sometime in June — to&nbsp;prioritize the safety of voters and poll workers, many of whom are elderly and thus more susceptible to the novel coronavirus if exposed.</p>
<p>“We barely pay those workers minimum wage,” Mr. Deasy said. “The least we can do is provide a safe environment.”</p>
<p>Citing similar concerns about the health of older poll workers and staffing issues presented by Department of State employees working from home, Rep. Sara Innamorato, D-Lawrenceville, said the state should consider postponing the primary while the legislature acts, in the meantime, on proposed legislation that would require the state to send mail-in ballot applications to all eligible voters.</p>
<p>That legislation, introduced recently by Rep. Kevin Boyle, would allocate funds so the state could mail all voters an application with prepaid postage, in an effort to ensure that in the event that in-person voting is deemed unsafe, voters could still exercise their rights. The bill awaits action in the House State Government Committee, of which Mr. Boyle is the ranking member.</p>
<p>Voters who want a no-excuse mail-in ballot or a traditional absentee ballot have until April 21 at 5 p.m. to apply for one, and can do so online or by paper application delivered to or filled out at their county election office.</p>
<p>Rep. Dan Miller, D-Mt. Lebanon, said he&nbsp;“would” support moving the primary but also wants the state to send mail-in ballot applications to registered voters regardless, which he said would likely be&nbsp;“the safest way for people to vote at this time.”</p>
<p>To Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Squirrel Hill, stakeholders should focus on putting resources into educating people about vote-by-mail rather than a suspension of the election.</p>
<p>“Messing with elections is serious business — putting it off until an uncertain future is not something I’m comfortable with,” Mr. Frankel said, adding that for those who are worried about their safety,&nbsp;“you can vote from your living room.”</p>
<p>Rep. Mike Puskaric, a Union Republican whose district crosses over into Allegheny County, said he doesn’t support suspending the primary because&nbsp;“it is important that we get back to normal life as quickly as possible, and our democratic process is a part of that.”</p>
<p>Mr. Puskaric said the legislature is working on “innovative solutions for these unprecedented times,” including a package to assist schools and small businesses that complements federal efforts.</p>
<p>As lawmakers consider the implications of suspending an election, one local election security expert is warning that the process might be messy.</p>
<p>Warning that Pennsylvania law says “less than you would hope” about postponing elections, Christopher Deluzio, policy director of the University of Pittsburgh Institute for Cyber Law, Policy, and Security, is urging stakeholders to revise the election code to outline who has the authority to do so and what the procedure would entail.</p>
<p>Mr. Deluzio said the governor, Department of State, legislature and local election officials must collaborate quickly to clarify a procedure that would&nbsp;“give the public greater confidence in what’s happening and more clarity if in fact we are still in a public health pandemic and get closer and closer to April 28.”</p>
<p>“The public deserves that kind of transparency and clear guidelines, as we’re in uncharted territory with a global health pandemic and elections coming up,” Mr. Deluzio said.</p>
<p>If officials were to advocate for postponing the election now, “it’s a little unclear” how it would proceed, Mr. Deluzio said. Traditionally, the courts have acted with authority in dealing with disasters on Election Day, but this situation is different — with time to act.</p>
<p>Mr. Deluzio said he thinks it’s premature to make a decision to suspend the election, and that the state has a few weeks to see how things progress. But he warned that officials should be having a discussion and debate now.</p>
<p>State Rep. Jake Wheatley, D-Hill District, said it’s too early to make the decision to postpone the election, but that officials must consider how to make physical locations safe by providing workers with safety equipment, limiting the amount of people inside a polling place at one time and instituting 6-feet spacing between participants.</p>
<p>“Be smart, be careful, but come out and vote,” Mr. Wheatley said, a message to his constituents. “Vote by mail if you feel you must but come out and vote.”</p>
