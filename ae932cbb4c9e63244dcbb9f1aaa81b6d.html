<h1>Pittsburgh Councilman O’Connor introduces bill regulating police use of facial recognition tech</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Councilman Corey O’Connor on Tuesday introduced a bill that would require council to approve police use of facial recognition and predictive policing technology.</p>
<p>The bill, presented during the council’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qL0A6G_hUM" target="_blank">regular meeting</a>, would require the city Department of Public Safety to seek approval from council before they acquire and use such technology.</p>
<p>Acquisition or use may be approved if the council finds the tech “does not maintain or perpetuate bias, poses no risk to the civil rights and liberties of residents and is in line with scientifically-validated and peer-reviewed research on the stipulated purpose,” the bill says.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police currently do not own facial recognition technology, but a database from the Pennsylvania Justice Network — otherwise known as JNET — is accessible to police forces across the commonwealth.</p>
<p>Police spokeswoman Cara Cruz didn’t share specific examples of how JNET is used, but said its “primary use is as [an] investigative tool only. Photographs or screen grabs from surveillance video from a crime, for example, would be analyzed and compared digitally through this technology.”</p>
<p>The results of a search are considered investigative leads and are not to be considered a positive identification of any subject, Ms. Cruz said, adding that city of Pittsburgh cameras are not equipped with or linked to any type of facial recognition technology.</p>
<p>“There are other cities larger than ours that have been banning this,” Mr. O’Connor said. “This is not only a national trend, but we’re seeing that people are being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html" target="_blank">wrongly prosecuted</a>.”</p>
<p>He pointed to studies that have shown that many facial recognition systems are imperfect and are biased against certain <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">ethnicities</span>. One report by the&nbsp;National Institute of Standards and Technology these systems <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/facial-recognition-bias.html" target="_blank">falsely identified</a> African-American and Asian faces up to 100 times more than Caucasian faces.</p>
<p>In June, Mayor Bill Peduto announced the city would&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/23/Pittsburgh-suspends-policing-police-program-algorithms-predict-predictive-hot-spots-crime-data/stories/202006230059" target="_blank">suspend its predictive policing program</a>&nbsp;— an algorithm that used data to predict&nbsp;“hot spots” of criminal activity — citing concerns about potential racial bias. The mayor said the city would focus data-driven resources toward social services.</p>
<p>The bill’s introduction comes amid nationwide protests against police misconduct and systemic racism. In Pittsburgh, such protests have <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/08/19/Pittsburgh-protest-Mayor-Bill-Peduto-home-plainclothes-police-arrest/stories/202008190156" target="_blank">made their way to the mayor’s home</a>&nbsp;in Point Breeze.</p>
<p>Last week, one of those demonstrations was declared an unlawful assembly and ended with police using pepper spray and other crowd control devices on protesters as they were told to disperse near Mellon Park.</p>
<p>Following that protest, Mr. O’Connor wrote on Twitter,&nbsp;“Pittsburghers continue to raise their voice in protest and it is unconscionable that we continue to silence them. We need to do just the opposite.</p>
<p>“Now is the time to listen and act. We need to take this opportunity to build a more inclusive democracy that facilitates engagement at the front end. What we saw over the weekend and what we saw last night in the East End was unacceptable.”</p>
<p>In determining whether to approve such technology, the bill says council would look at aspects such as the purpose of the technology; a&nbsp;“general description” of the information and data that would be collected; which city employees have access to it; and how the information would be collected and recorded.</p>
<p>The bill lists several items that would not be considered such “select surveillance technology,” including medical equipment, stationary security cameras on city property, police body cameras, unmodified personal communication devices and gunshot detection technology, which the city currently uses with its ShotSpotter system.</p>
<p>At a press conference Tuesday, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said he has expressed concerns about the legislation to council members and its potential effects on law enforcement in Pittsburgh, and said his department needs to take a closer look at the bill before he gives a recommendation on it.</p>
<p>“Technology needs to be used real-time,” Mr. Hissrich said.&nbsp;“And having to go through a chain of events to try to be able to use that technology presents a problem.”</p>
<p>Mr. O’Connor said the bill is not asking public safety officials to come back to City Council every time they want to use technology after somebody runs a red light or robs a store.&nbsp;“If this [technology] comes to Pittsburgh and you want to adopt this in the future, then just come and have a public conversation about it.”</p>
