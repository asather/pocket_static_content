<p>Saturday’s 3-2 overtime loss was deflating for the Penguins, who got only two of their 41 shots through Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price, squandered six of seven power plays and couldn’t bury a penalty shot late in regulation.</p>
<p>But after giving away Game 1 of the five-game series, the Penguins took a positive tone in a Sunday press conference after an afternoon practice in Toronto.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan said he told his team there’s much to feel good about.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of the game we really liked [Saturday]. And then after watching the game film, it just provided that much more affirmation,” he said. “I felt our energy was really good. I thought we were playing on our toes. I thought we had a great start even though we didn’t score and we ended up down a goal.”</p>
<p>The Penguins, despite dominating the first period, trailed 2-0 in the second. They scored twice in about three minutes and had ample opportunities to overtake the underdog Canadiens. But they just couldn’t get another puck past Price.</p>
<p>There were defensive breakdowns scattered throughout the game and Montreal got the better of the chances in overtime. But Pittsburgh isn’t panicking.</p>
<p>“We know what we did wrong. It was just kind of some little things,” Jared McCann said. “We felt like we controlled most of the game, to be honest with you. We had our chances. … They played well and their goalie played well.”</p>
<p>Sunday’s practice was not open to media. But Sullivan said he was encouraged by their energy. He added that he thought their execution was “pretty good.”</p>
<p>The players indicated that special teams were a major point of emphasis after ineptitude there cost them Game 1. While going 1 for 7 on the power play, they couldn’t cash in on a 5-on-3 in the third period that lasted 92 seconds.</p>
<p>There was also talk about getting pucks deep to wear down Montreal’s top three defensemen, who played a ton in Game 1, and getting more bodies to the net to make it more difficult for Price to track the puck and control rebounds.</p>
<p>“I think if we … get more people to the net, that will help us,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>The Penguins have now lost seven consecutive playoff games dating back to the second round of the 2018 playoffs. But Brian Dumoulin insisted that doubt isn’t creeping in for a veteran Penguins core that is running out of chances.</p>
<p>“It’s something we haven’t even talked about or thought about. … We’re on to Game 2,” the blue-liner said. “Right now, we’re down 0-1 in this series. If we win this next game, then it’s best-of-three. So that’s what we’re focused on.”</p>
<p>Game 2 is scheduled for 8 p.m. Monday.</p>
