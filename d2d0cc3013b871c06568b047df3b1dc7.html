<h1>Five things to know about the Montreal Canadiens, the Penguins' qualifying round foe</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The Penguins will face the Montreal Canadiens in the best-of-five qualifying round of the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning Saturday. Here are five things to know about the Atlantic Division foe that enters the series as a heavy underdog.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. First, the COVID-19 stuff —</strong>&nbsp;Sorry, have to start there for everything these days. You may <a href="https://theathletic.com/1924336/2020/07/13/sources-multiple-montreal-canadiens-players-test-positive-for-covid-19/" target="_blank">remember hearing </a>that multiple Canadiens tested positive for the virus earlier in July. Defensemen Brett Kulak and Xavier Ouellet have since been identified as two of them, and they are <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/sports/hockey/nhl/hockey-inside-out/canadiens-brett-kulak-feels-good-after-being-sidelined-with-covid-19" target="_blank">back with the team</a>. Only Kulak experienced some symptoms. Center Max Domi is in the mix, too, after <a href="https://www.si.com/nhl/2020/07/21/max-domi-joins-canadiens-nhl-restart" target="_blank">considering opting out</a>&nbsp;because he is diabetic. Defenseman Karl Alzner is the one notable absence because of the pandemic. He announced <a href="https://www.nhl.com/canadiens/news/karl-alzner-opts-out-of-phases-3-and-4-of-the-nhls-return-to-play-plan/c-317388724" target="_blank">he’d be opting out</a> of the restart a couple of weeks ago. He played in just four games for the Canadiens this season.</p>
<p><strong>2. Limit the centers, limit the scoring —</strong>&nbsp;As our Mike DeFabo <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/07/27/Shutting-down-potent-Montreal-top-line-especially-important-for-Penguins/stories/202007270118" target="_blank">wrote the other day</a>, Montreal’s offense is pretty top-heavy, with the first line of Tomas Tatar, Phillip Danault and Brendan Gallagher accounting for three of the top four spots on the team’s scoring list. The need to slow their production is obvious. Beyond them, the centers are the guys to keep an eye on in this short series. Domi and Nick Suzuki are the only other forwards with more than 40 points on the season. The rest have 30 or fewer, so the Penguins’ ability to shut down their playmaking could be key in choking off secondary scoring and putting even more pressure on the top line.</p>
<p><strong>3. The defense corps lacks depth, too —</strong>&nbsp;The Canadiens blog <a href="https://awinninghabit.com/2020/07/29/montreal-canadiens-familiar-flaws/" target="_blank">A Winning Habit</a> noted in a recent post that three of the team’s defensemen rank in the NHL’s top 30 in ice time this season. That’s pretty wild in an NHL where most teams have a guy logging pretty heavy minutes on the blue line. You’d expect each to have one, maybe two on that list. The fact that Montreal has three reflects how heavily coach Claude Julien relies upon Shea Weber, Ben Chiarot and Jeff Petry. And that’s a present tense thing, too. Each played at least 16:56 in an exhibition loss Tuesday against Toronto. No other defenseman played more than 14:05, a sign that they could have a hard time containing the Penguins if they can get all four lines generating scoring chances.</p>

<p><strong>4. The power play appears to still be dreadful —</strong>&nbsp;It’s bad enough that Montreal finished the regular season with the 22nd-ranked power play unit by conversion rate at just 17.7%. The Canadiens already figured to have one of the weaker units in these playoffs. And they only reinforced that notion with their performance Tuesday, failing to score on six man advantages and giving up not one, but two shorthanded goals. As inconsistent as the Penguins’ own power play has been at times in 2019-20, they should still be at a significant advantage against the Habs.</p>
<p><strong>5. Yes, Carey Price is in goal and key for the Canadiens’ chances —</strong>&nbsp;But you knew that, if you know anything about this team that the Penguins have been scheduled to play for what feels like a lifetime. His numbers actually aren’t that great. His goals against average of 2.79 and save percentage of .909 both rank 32nd in the NHL, putting him in a league with the Penguins’ inconsistent Matt Murray. Like his counterpart, though, he’s demonstrated the ability to steal a series in his career. And in a five-game series, even a couple of stellar games could make the difference between predictable outcome and stunning upset.</p>
