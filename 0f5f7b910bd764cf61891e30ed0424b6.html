<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 05.20.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, we will start our chat in about 10 minutes so get those questions ready... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, here we go....</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Hi Gerry. If the media covering a game are theoretically going to be spread out around the stadium, where would your preferred spot be? Higher up/better angle, or closer to the field/chance of hearing what is being said on the sidelines? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: First off, nobody has said how the media will be assembled. But they will have to be spread out, but not around the stadium like spectators in different sections. I’m perfectly fine where I watch the game. The last thing I would want is to be close to the field.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: Hello Gerry, Do you think teams with a lot of veterans vs young players will have an advantage if the league holds games with no fans? Or do you think it won’t make any difference to the players? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’m not sure anyone will have an advantage and I’m not sure who will be affected less -- the younger guys or older guys. But there’s no question it will have an effect, especially on the guys who like to play to the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>The Eman</strong>: how much does coaching really matter in the NFL? Assume all 32 teams had the same personnel, same injuries, same game weather conditions, etc. The average coach will finish 8 and 8. How many games will a really good coach - Belichek, Tomlin, Reid - win? How many does a bad coach - Lewis - lose? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: More than any other league, the NFL is a coach’s league. Every team has players who are big, strong, fast, can run, can jump. The draft and free agency see to that. It’s a matter of which coach uses his players best and puts them in the best position to win.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: I really thought Marcus Allen had potential coming out of PSU; big hitter. Why do you think he has not panned out yet? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: When he entered his final season at PSU, Marcus Allen was considered one of the top defensive backs in the country. But his stock went down that final season, maybe because of a lack of interceptions. He has a lot of ability but I think the Steelers want to see him take his job a little more seriously. He has a chance this season to play a little more, possibly as a dime linebacker because, yes, he’s a big hitter.</p>
<p><strong>greg in lewisville, texas</strong>: IF...............the 2020 NFL season does start in September, with all the restrictions and stadium capacity rules, the owners with the loss of tickets sold revenue [which also means concessions and parking] they will be taking a huge hit per game with revenue income. Will the players be asked to be paid a pro-rated amount of money per game during this time period? It seems only fair that if the owners are not getting their money, the players should not be getting full game check money even though the players contract states a certain amount that was previously negotiated.. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, I don’t think you can say it’s only fair that the players should not get their money just because the owners aren’t getting all of theirs. They are paid to perform in 16 games, plus preseason and possibly postseason, and if they do they will get their money. Where you will see an effect is next year, possibly in the salary cap, because overall revenue this season will be down.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: With Ben back do you see Diontae Johnson having a huge year ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He had a big year last year for a rookie -- led all rookie receivers in the league in receptions. So it only stands to reason he can be and should be even more productive with BR back.</p>
<p><strong>DavieJ</strong>: Hi Gerry......Big Ben 1st ballot HOF. Yay or Nay? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes. Unless knuckleheads such as Deion Sanders and Sterling Sharpe are voting, which they are not.</p>
<p><strong>DavieJ</strong>: We’re bored! FULL NFL playoff prediction now! Thx Gerry!! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’m not that bored</p>
<p><strong>MikeMc</strong>: When you look at the numbers and physical tools Claypool has, it is kind of surprising he was a 2nd rounder right? Are there some big concerns I am not seeing in his game or is it more chalked up to the great depth of the whole WR class? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’m with you Mike. His measurables and speed are through the roof and he had big-time production at Notre Dame. I can tell you this -- Kevin Colbert didn’t think he was a second-round talent. He was going to take Claypool over a number of receivers who were drafted ahead of him.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: If there is no NFL season, will any player become a free agent in 2021 <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t think you will have to worry about that scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Utah Jim</strong>: The Steelers have historically paid big money to only one WR at a time. Of the current players, who do you see getting a big second contract? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: JuJu.</p>
<p><strong>Where’s My Clark Bar</strong>: Hi Gerry, should we consider firing Tomlin and then rehire him Under the Rooney Rule to gain a few draft picks. Seems a win-win for Steelers And Tomlin if this proposal passes. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: So go flout and undermine the very same rule you helped create???</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Gerry, do you think there will be players who do not want to participate without a vaccine? If so, how does the team and league deal with this? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I definitely think there will be some players who are hesitant to play, though I don’t think there will be any vaccine by the time the season is played. Under the circumstances, I think the players union and owners will have to come to some agreement where a player, who fears for his health, can elect not to play. Then they would have to decide if that affects his salary. Failing that, I guess players could always feign an injury, claiming their knee hurts or their hamstring is tight.</p>
<p><strong>FrankJ</strong>: I miss Aaron Smith and Heath Miller. Stood out for being under appreciated, super dependable, rocks, humble, etc. What are your overall memories of those two? Where do we find more players like them? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They are two of my all-time favorites -- great players, great teammates, great people. They should all be like those two.</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Gerry, I enjoy and appreciate all your Steelers coverage. I know this is a frequent question among fans but why doesn’t Tomlin understand the impact an above average punter would have on any team? Field position means so much. He talks a good game about special teams yet has consistently kept a barely average punter. Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I can promise you Tomlin doesn’t underestimate the impact a punter can have on the game. He’s not naive. But finding them isn’t that easy. The Steelers always bring at least one punter to camp to challenge Berry, who I would classify as inconsistent not barely average. I will also remind you that the Steelers won a Super Bowl in 2008 when Mitch Berger averaged 41.3 yards per punt. Berry averaged 45.5 yards last season.</p>
<p><strong>FrankJ</strong>: What have you heard about how the league will deal with if a player becomes covid positive in season? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The league has not said but I’m sure players will be tested every morning when they arrive at a facility to hopefully help prevent that scenario from occurring. Doesn’t mean it will but at least they will try to stay ahead of the problem before it might get worse.</p>
<p><strong>LBGone</strong>: In his second season with the team, what new things do you think we’ll see from Minkah? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t think you want to see anything new; you want to see the same old thing he did last season when he was an All-Pro. I’m guessing what you mean is how might the Steelers use him in different roles? Will they give him freedom like Troy Polamalu? They are always trying to find ways to be less predictable and more innovative, so there might be a new wrinkle or two. But, you know what they saw if the wheel ain’t broke.....</p>
<p><strong>ZO</strong>: Gerry, Thanks for the great work you do here with the “chats.” Being a big PSU Fan, I found the info shared about Marcus Allen interesting. With that in mind, do you thing the defense’s starting 11 are currently on the team, and if so, who fills the “Mark Barron Role” for the season? What are the odds that this could be a great fit for Marcus? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I do think their starting 11 are on the team, but it’s that 11th one at ILB that will be interesting to see. Vince Williams will be the starter opposite Devin Bush, but that doesn’t mean he will play all the snaps. I think you will see Ulysees Gilbert, rookie Antoine Brooks and, yes, Marcus Allen be tried there in their sub-package defenses. At this point, I don’t see them signing a veteran in free agency to fill that role, especially after their lack of success the past couple years with players such as Jon Bostic, Morgan Burnett and even Mark Barron, none of whom lasted more than one season.</p>
<p><strong>Theon</strong>: Hi Gerry, I think Tomlin’s a great coach, but with 14 years of tenure he has no coaching tree. Most coaches with his tenure have at least a couple of assistants that have gone on to success, what do you make of that? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You bring up an interesting point. In 15 years, Bill Cowher assembled an impressive coaching tree, hiring eight guys who would go on to become head coaches in the league -- Dom Capers, Marvin Lewis and Dick LeBeau from his original staff; Jim Haslett, Chan Gailey, Mike Mularkey, Ken Whisenhunt and Bruce Arians after that. Tomlin did hire two former head coaches -- Todd Haley and Mike Munchak. Again, good point.</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Gerry, and on the topic of special teams, Tomlin has failed miserably for a number of years to develop a respectable return game on either punt or kick off. Thanks <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I disagree. Do you remember Antonio Brown?</p>
<p><strong>Troy</strong>: Do you see a scenario where teams will offer all their games via PPV in the vent no fans are allowed to attend? May offset some of the loses for the teams revenue? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>Troy</strong>: Biggest hole you think still needs to be filled and potential players to fill them? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: ILB. The potential players are listed in earlier answer -- Vince Williams, Ulysees Gilbert III, Marcus Allen, Antoine Brooks.</p>
<p><strong>JDaven</strong>: Gerry, which teams in our division do you think will be affected more by the loss of practice time due to the virus and why? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They will all be affected, but the team with the biggest amount of rookies and first-year players will feel it the most</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: I believe Al Villanueva is in a contract year. What kind of offer do you think he should get after the season, assuming his performance is consistent with the past few years? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It depends who you think is making the offer. I’m not sure the Steelers will be in any hurry to re-sign AV. It depends what happens this season -- how he performs, do they think they have a player ready to step in? As a starting left tackle who has made two Pro Bowls, he will command a big contract. I’m not sure the Steelers will want to, or be able to, give him one.</p>
<p><strong>Troy</strong>: Gerry, I see this offense being deadly and back to their 2018 numbers should they stay healthy, with the addition of Claypool, and Ebron to go along with Ben and a decent running game. If the defense can perform at the level they did last year aren’t we a definite contender in the AFC? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I would not use the word “deadly” to potentially describe the offense. Let’s not get ahead of yourself. But I think with the addition of two big and tall weapons who can run, that will certainly help the offense big-time with BR back. And, yes, with the defense and QB back, they definitely are a big-time contender in the AFC. But they have to go show it.</p>
<p><strong>Troy</strong>: Gerry, realistic expectation for the starting O-Line? I have to think they only move Feiler to guard if the candidates at RT fail? Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Quite the opposite. The only way he’s going to guard is if their left guard candidates fail. And I don’t see that happening at all with Stefen Wisniewski and rookie Kevin Dotson. Matt Feiler is their right tackle.</p>
<p><strong>Maurice</strong>: Gerry assuming Ben is healthy, which QB would you rather have only for this 2 coming years starting for your team: Ben or Lamar Jackson? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ask me when Lamar Jackson wins a playoff game.</p>
<p><strong>MikeMc</strong>: The Steelers have a great group of starters on both the O and D line , but what are your thoughts on the depth behind them? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The depth on the defensive line is average at best, suspect at worst. It’s not befitting a rotation system that Karl Dunbar likes to use, though I understand the reason he likes to use it. As for the offensive line, you can count on three fingers how many teams in the league have quality depth on the O-line. Lot of teams have problems finding starters on the offensive line. I think the depth is serviceable, especially with the addition of Dotson.</p>
<p><strong>JDaven</strong>: I agree with Troy but more of a deadly defense than an offense but one that controls the clock. Gerry, do think the offense will be committed to the run game more this year? Committed like they practice and stressed turnovers last year and everyone responded. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You can stress turnovers all you want, getting them is an entirely different matter. Every team talks about taking the ball away. Not every team does it. As for running the ball, it’s not a question of commitment, it’s matter of producing. The Steelers ran the ball 42.1 percent of the time last season, far more frequently than they did in 2018 (32.6 percent of the time) when James Conner made the Pro Bowl. It was even more frequently than in 2017 (41.5) when Le’V Bell had 1,291 yards rushing. It’s not about commitment. It’s about execution.</p>
<p><strong>mvandrews7</strong>: Hi Gerry, Can you give us an update on what teams are allowed to do not that facilities are starting to reopen? Not sure what part of the preseason process we are in due to Covid-19. Thanks! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Just because facilities are starting to reopen doesn’t mean anything right now for the players and coaches. They are still not allowed at their facilities, only a limited amount of front-office personnel. Players and coaches won’t be allowed at the facility until every team in the league is allowed to have players and coaches. And, as we have seen, different states are operating under different guidelines because of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>ZO</strong>: Please rank the RBs (Conner, Snell, Samuels, McFadden) in order of number of snaps you expect them to see this season. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You just did.</p>
<p><strong>Willie</strong>: It seems that over the years the Steelers have always had one especially big hitter on the defense. That seems to be lacking now -- is it because of the way the game has changed ? or are we lacking th one big hit man, or am I just all wet ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You better find a towel. But there is no question the rules have outlawed that type of stuff. Oh, you still see it from time to time, but not nearly like before. $25,000 fines will do that to a player.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Why can an offensive line be great pass blocking and great running line but the Steelers O line can only pass block. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Unless you have done a scientific study of every offensive line, I don’t think there are many, if any, who are great (your word) at both. Some are better in one area than the other. The Steelers line is built to protect BR, and rightfully so. Do they do that better than run block? Yes, because they employ the type of technique necessary to do so. Also, do not think for a minute the run game isn’t affected when BR isn’t the QB.</p>
<p><strong>Buster</strong>: Do you know if Rudolph and/or Washington are good friends with Matthew Wolff? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I do not, but I will ask him when I see him. If I see him.</p>
<p><strong>Troy</strong>: Gerry, given the injury history of Connor why is Tomlin so hesitant to use a RB by committee approach? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They do have to use a committee approach -- when Conner is injured, which is frequently. But he is their best back...when healthy. That’s why.</p>
<p><strong>mvandrews7</strong>: Gerry, Can you explain to the readers that constantly complaining about being “committed to the run” is nonsense. Teams that have QB’s that can sling it don’t commit to the run. You only need to run when you want too, i.e. 4 yards a pop to keep teams off balance. A 60% 40% mix is just fine. Maybe even 70% 30% is good enough. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Pay the man!! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That’s all the time we have today, kids. Thanx for the questions.</p>
