<h1>After lobbying from Butler steel plant owner, Trump admin launches investigation on imports of transformer components</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON —&nbsp;The Trump administration announced Monday it will launch an investigation into whether imports of electrical steel components threaten U.S. national security, after the owner of a Butler County steel plant <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/03/12/Trump-tariffs-loophole-jobs-Butler-AK-Steel-Cleveland-Cliffs-Mike-Kelly/stories/202003120072?cid=search" target="_blank">threatened to shutter the facility</a> if federal trade actions were not taken.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce will assess whether imports of the components should be subject to tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. That section was invoked by the Commerce Department to impose 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% tariffs on aluminum imports in March 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, the Commerce Department acknowledged the investigation “follows inquiries and requests from multiple members of Congress as well as industry stakeholders.”</p>
<p>“The Department of Commerce will conduct a thorough, fair, and transparent review to determine the effects on the national security,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Section 232 tariffs imposed March 2018 covered imports of the electrical steel components, which are used in the manufacture of power grid transformers and produced at the Butler Works and the Zanesville Works in Ohio, both owned by Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.&nbsp;But the trade penalties did not contemplate imports of slightly altered electrical steel sheets that can be stacked, wound and slit.</p>
<p>In March, Lourenco Goncalves, Cleveland-Cliffs’ chairman and CEO, accused Asian countries of circumventing the tariffs by routing electrical steel through Mexico and Canada, where it undergoes minimal processing.</p>
<p>Mr. Goncalves told the annual meeting of the Congressional Steel Caucus<strong>&nbsp;</strong>— chaired by&nbsp;Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon —&nbsp;that a recent surge in imports would force him to shut down the plants in Butler and Zanesville shortly after purchasing them from AK Steel on March 13.&nbsp;Those plants are the only U.S. producer of the transformer components.</p>
<p>“If this thing is not corrected ... there are 1,500 jobs in Butler, Pa., and 100 jobs in Zanesville, Ohio, that will be gone,” Mr. Goncalves testified. “And I promise they will be gone if I don’t get help.”</p>
<p>Mr. Goncalves has found bipartisan allies on Capitol Hill, from Mr. Lamb to&nbsp;Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, who has been pressing the administration since 2017 to act on the concerns of the plant.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday,&nbsp;Mr. Kelly called the plant “a bedrock of our national security and the Butler economy.”</p>
<p>“Thank you to President Trump, Secretary Ross, and U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer for hearing our community's concerns and taking action to end the unfair trade practices that threaten AK Steel's ability to continue production of electrical steel,” Mr. Kelly said in a statement Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said he and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, had spoken with Mr. Ross last week about the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m glad they’re finally paying attention to an issue on which several senators have repeatedly urged action,” Mr. Casey wrote Monday. “I will continue to push for a swift completion to this review.”</p>
<p>Mr. Goncalves told the Post-Gazette in March that in addition to expanded tariffs, he wants Congress to strengthen trade law to expose and penalize entities that deliberately evade U.S. tariffs. “We want smugglers to go to jail,” he said.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department’s investigation follows complaints from some U.S. manufacturers that other countries are dumping slightly processed steel to evade the Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs.</p>
<p>In January, Mr. Trump announced he would expand the tariffs to cover products made of steel and aluminum: nails, tacks, staples, cables, wires and car and tractor bumpers.</p>
