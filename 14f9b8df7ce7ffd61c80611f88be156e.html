<h1>COVID-19 in Pittsburgh: A timeline of the first six months</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On March 14 — six months ago Monday — Allegheny County held a news conference to announce its first cases of COVID-19. Now, the event seems almost quaint. There were no masks to be seen. Doctors in white coats lined up shoulder to shoulder with U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb. Reporters and photographers filled the room.</p>
<p>Six months, 11,126 cases and 361 deaths in Allegheny County later, here’s a look back.</p>
<p><strong>‘A pretty good early run’</strong></p>
<p><em style="text-align: center; font-size: 10pt;">As major metropolitan areas go, the Pittsburgh region saw COVID-19 arrive fairly late. Washington state saw its first case in January and its first death in February. Pennsylvania didn’t announce its first case until March 6. Because preparations had already begun across the state, Allegheny County shut down quickly.</em></p>
<p>On March 13 — the day before Allegheny County’s first case — Gov. Tom Wolf shut down schools statewide. That same day, Washington County announced the first case in the region.</p>
<p>But overall, cases remained low, especially compared to the outbreaks already in full swing in Seattle and New York City.</p>
<p>“We had a pretty good early run,” said Mark Roberts, professor and chair of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. “If you look at the graph of cases over time, back in April, we were doing pretty well with surprisingly few cases.”</p>
<p>The peak day of the early months of COVID-19 came with 73 new cases on April 3 — a number that would be considered an average day today.</p>
<p><em style="text-align: center; font-size: 10pt;"><img src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/09/13/WEB-Allegheny-County-covid19-deaths-cases-975-px" alt="" width="100%"></em></p>
<p>A week after Allegheny County announced its first case, it announced the first death, a Clairton resident in their late 60s. In the next two months, many more deaths followed — often of elderly residents in long-term care facilities. In the first two months of the pandemic, Allegheny County had only recorded 13% of its cases to date — but 39% of its deaths, at 139. By mid-May, the county had seen 28 deaths of residents at Caring Heights Community Care and Rehab in Coraopolis, 31 at St. Barnabas in Richland, and 18 at the Kane Living Center at Glen Hazel.</p>
<p>In Beaver County, COVID-19 <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/06/07/brighton-rehab-coronavirus-outbreak-nursing-homes-pa-emotional-trauma/stories/202006040186" target="_blank">devastated the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center</a>, ultimately causing at least 82 deaths at the facility, which is now under state and federal investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow and green</strong></p>
<p>With case counts low, on May 15 Allegheny County became the state’s most densely populated area to move into the yellow phase. The green phase followed three weeks later on June 5, meaning that restaurants, hair salons and gyms could open. And with a spate of beautiful, dry weather, people flocked to newly reopened establishments.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that we expected the reaction of people to be quite so robust,” said Dr. Roberts, who also directs Pitt’s Public Health Dynamics Laboratory. “There were a lot of people partying, going out to bars, not wearing masks.”</p>
<p>While most restaurants and bars adhered to rules on mask-wearing and capacity limits, some did not. In June, the county Health Department&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2020/07/07/Complaints-bars-restaurants-masks-Allegheny-County-Health-Department/stories/202007070113" target="_blank">received more than 500 complaints about restaurants and bars not following COVID safety rules</a>.</p>
<p>Still, on June 17, the county hit a milestone: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/06/17/covid-19-coronavirus-Allegheny-County-Western-Pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-28/stories/202006170110" target="_blank">zero new cases</a>. In a news conference that day, however, county Health Department Director Debra Bogen cautioned that the figure “does not reflect the real time spread of the virus over Allegheny County.</p>
<p>“We still have a long way to go.”</p>
<p><strong>The spike</strong></p>
<p>The next week, that became apparent.</p>
<p>On June 22, the county reported 45 new cases — its highest total in months. And cases continued to climb. By the end of June, new daily cases had reached triple digits for the first time. County officials attributed the “alarming” spike to out-of-state travel to COVID-19 hot spots and to bars and restaurants that were not following the rules.</p>
<p>On June 29, the county <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/06/28/covid-19-coronavirus-allegheny-county-western-pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-32/stories/202006280096" target="_blank">implemented a ban on alcohol sales at bars and restaurants</a>;&nbsp;it shut dine-in service down entirely on July 3. Two days prior, Mr. Wolf had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/01/pa-masks-required-anyone-who-leaves-home-covid-19-cases-increase-pennsylvania/stories/202007010145" target="_blank">imposed a new statewide mask mandate</a> to stem the increase in cases.</p>
<p>Through early July, cases continued to rise, though they affected a younger population than in the spring. According to state data, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/13/COVID-19-pittsburgh-Allegheny-County-pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-infections/stories/202007130071" target="_blank">the county hit its peak of new cases on July 13, with 322</a>. That week, the county averaged more than 200 new cases per day. On some days, Allegheny County accounted for nearly half the cases reported in the state as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Tentative reopening</strong></p>
<p>Because of closures, crowd size limits and increased public awareness — or maybe a combination of those — cases started to fall in late July and plateaued in August. Over the past week, new cases averaged 62 per day. Following the case spike in late June and early July, deaths in late July and early August increased as well, though not to the level of the early months of the pandemic.</p>
<p>As cases have stabilized, officials have slowly begun relaxing restrictions. Restaurants were permitted to open outdoor dining on July 9, when the county also imposed gathering limits of 25 people inside and 50 people outside. Indoor dining at 25% capacity was permitted on July 17; Mr. Wolf announced that as of Sept. 21, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/dining/2020/09/08/Pennsylvania-Governor-Wolf-restaurants-capacity-coronavirus-pandemic-safety-database/stories/202009080074" target="_blank">that limit will be raised to 50%</a>.</p>
<p>County officials on Aug. 29 raised the outdoor gathering limit from 50 to 100.</p>
<p>The cases in recent weeks have remained “relatively stable,” which, to Dr. Roberts, might actually be a good sign.</p>
<p>“I look at it cautiously optimistically because those last couple of weeks in Allegheny County anyway have occurred at a time when there’s been a tremendous influx of students,” he said. “Look at the other universities around the U.S. that have seen literally thousands of cases when the students come back.”</p>
<p>County Executive Rich Fitzgerald also expressed relief last week that the county’s 85,000 college students had not caused new cases to spike overall, though new cases are still up among younger residents. In the southwestern part of the state, the 19-24 age group accounted for approximately 5% of cases in April compared to approximately 29% so far in September.</p>
<p>As it has nationwide, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Black Americans. The population of Allegheny County is 13% Black, but 25% of those testing positive for COVID-19 in the county are African American, as are 17% of those who have died from the disease.</p>
<p>Compared to other urban areas its size nationwide, Allegheny County still has relatively few cases. Dr. Roberts cautioned, however, that case counts are heavily dependent on testing prevalence and that other areas of the county have different testing culture and availability.</p>
