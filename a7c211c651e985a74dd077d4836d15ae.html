<h1>Code Orange will go 'Under the Skin' with livestream on July 30</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Code Orange, who pioneered the empty-venue livestream when COVID-19 shut things down in mid-March, will be back at it again on July 30 with a new livestream called “Under the Skin.”</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh hardcore / metal band, known for its crushing live shows, will do a more stripped-down set from The Theatre Factory in Trafford, broadcast via the Code Orange Twitch channel.</p>
<p>They describe it as “conceptually akin to classic MTV Unplugged performances, but with nightmarish digital twists and turns.”</p>
<p>Code Orange, currently promoting the acclaimed new album “Underneath,” teased the stream with an animated video piece Monday night following their bi-weekly Twitch livestream series, “YOU AND YOU ALONE.” Exclusive merch along with a new limited-edition vinyl pressing of “Underneath” will be available during the livestream event via the band’s webstore.</p>
