<h1>Peters Township  School Board purchases laptops for all students </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Soon, all students in the Peters Township School District will have a school-provided laptop computer.</p>
<p>The school board on June 4 approved lease agreements for about 3,500 laptops. There is a four-year agreement with Dell for 2,000 Dell Latitude 3190 laptop computers and Active Pens at an annual cost of $235,835 and a four-year lease for 1,500 Dell Latitude 3190 two-in-one Chromebook computers and Targus stylus pens at an annual cost cost of $139,283.42.</p>
<p>“This provides students in K through 12 with one-to-one devices across the board for that consistent experience,” said Adam Swinchock, district director of technology.</p>
<p>Superintendent Jeannine French said the computers were requested by the administration for “improving in-classroom instruction as well as the potential for remote instruction.”</p>
<p>Board member Lisa Anderson said she was under the impression students will return for in-person instruction in the fall.</p>
<p>Ms. French said the administration is planning for “all scenarios based on what’s going on with the prevalence of disease in our community. But our intention and desire is that we’ll have our children back in classrooms with us.”</p>
<p>Ms. French said the devices will “allow for a seamless transition” if the district is forced to implement remote learning during the school year.</p>
