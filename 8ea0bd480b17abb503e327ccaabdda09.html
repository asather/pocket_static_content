<h1>Turnovers keyed Pitt's second-half comeback at North Carolina</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Something had to change.</p>
<p>Pitt trailed North Carolina by nine, 37-28, at halftime Wednesday night in a building where the Tar Heels hadn’t squandered such a large lead at the break since before the vast majority of the Panthers’ roster had even been born. Coming off a disheartening loss four days earlier against Wake Forest, Pitt looked lethargic, perhaps even overwhelmed by what looks to be one of the worst North Carolina teams in recent memory.</p>
<p>In the second half, things turned. In the final 20 minutes, the Panthers outscored their opponent, 45-28, en route to a 73-65 victory. A resurgent offense riding a barrage of 3-pointers keyed the comeback, but it was Pitt’s defense — specifically its ability to create turnovers — that played an understated, perhaps even more important role.</p>
<p>After getting only four points off seven turnovers in the first half, the Panthers forced 10 turnovers in the second half, off which they got 12 points. Some of those points were more of a technicality, situations where Pitt had caused a turnover on one end — be it a travel, a bad pass out of bounds or a shot-clock violation — and scored on the other in a half-court set, one in which the basket had little to do with an undermanned or discombobulated defense recovering from a miscue.</p>
<p>Some of those early turnovers, however, got the Panthers back into a game in which, to that point, they had largely been playing catch-up. Trailing by seven, 45-38, with just under 15 minutes to play, two Pitt defenders trapped North Carolina’s Armando Bacot in the corner. Bacot tried to escape the jam by passing it to teammate Leaky Black, but Trey McGowens poked it away before tossing a long pass to a streaking Ryan Murphy, who was fouled on a layup attempt and made both free throws.</p>
<p>On the ensuing Tar Heels possession, McGowens yet again showcased his opportunistic defense, sagging slightly off his man, Brandon Robinson, near the top of the key. Having picked up his dribble, Andrew Platek, thinking he had a teammate open, passed it to Robinson, only for McGowens to jump in the lane and thunder home a dunk on the other end.</p>

<p>In 18 seconds, North Carolina’s lead had shrunk from seven to three, in part because a Pitt offense that struggled for so much of the first half saw its confidence build after converting on easy opportunities created by its defense.</p>
<p>That turnover count didn’t include another play from a minute earlier in the first half, when Murphy chased down a long rebound off a missed 3 from Jeremiah Francis of the Tar Heels. It looked briefly like Garrison Brooks would corral the board, but after the ball had been in his hands for a fraction of a second, Murphy knocked it away. Pitt’s Eric Hamilton grabbed the loose ball, threw it out to a sprinting Murphy, who, with nobody within 15 feet of him, converted a layup.</p>

<p>“We got stops when we needed to,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “We got free-throw blockouts, which is something that we worked on for the past couple of days, understanding what a good rebounding team they are. We forced 17 turnovers. We made an adjustment with what we wanted to in the post. Our guys were able to follow that.”</p>
<p><strong>Some Disney-style wisdom</strong></p>
<p>From a play-making standpoint, Wednesday night’s win was far from a stellar one for Xavier Johnson, who finished with six turnovers to three assists.</p>
<p>The sophomore point guard’s importance was demonstrated vividly in the first half, though. After getting his second foul with 10:38 remaining in the half, Johnson was subbed out. Over the 4:44 that elapsed before he was re-inserted, the Panthers were outscored, 11-2, giving the Tar Heels the advantage they would hold on to until Pitt made its second-half push. His absence was pronounced.</p>
<p>It could have been worse, too, had a worthwhile gamble by Johnson not paid off. With just under five minutes remaining, Johnson, with two fouls, moved off his man near the baseline and stepped in front of a driving Francis, who was whistled for a charge.</p>
<p>He had stepped over and clearly set his position, but had the call gone the other way, Johnson may have spent the rest of the half on the bench.</p>
<p>The win against the Tar Heels was a bounce-back not only for Pitt, but its standout point guard, as well. Johnson struggled against Wake Forest and made a crucial mistake in the final 30 seconds, when he panicked by hoisting up a contested, off-balance shot after picking up his dribble, a situation in which he could have called Pitt’s final timeout.</p>
<p>Johnson said Wednesday it was “a dumb decision,” one he was still beating himself up over during Pitt’s practice Sunday. Capel, noticing that Johnson didn’t look like his usual self, texted him later in the day. He provided a reassuring message, complete with a clip from “The Lion King” in which Rafiki — a wise, old mandrill — tells Simba, the film’s protagonist, that “The past can hurt. But the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it.” Johnson took the words to heart.</p>
<p>“I told him I’m going to learn from it and I’m going to move on and get better,” he said.</p>
