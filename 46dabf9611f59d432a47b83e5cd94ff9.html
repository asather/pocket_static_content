<h1>Steelers 2020 draft picks finalized by NFL</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With the NFL draft a little more than six weeks away, the league has finalized the order of picks, which includes six selections for the Steelers:</p>
<p><strong>Steelers 2020 draft slots:</strong></p>
<p>• Round 2, No. 17 (No. 49 overall)</p>
<p>• Round 3, No. 38 (No. 102 overall, compensatory selection)</p>
<p>• Round 4, No. 18 (No. 124 overall)</p>
<p>• Round 4, No. 29 (No. 135 overall)</p>
<p>• Round 6, No. 19 (No. 198 overall)</p>
<p>• Round 7, No. 18 (No. 232 overall)</p>
<p>The Steelers also would’ve had the 18th pick in the first round, 19th in the third, plus No. 9 and No. 17 in the fifth if not for trades. Their first-rounder went to Miami last September in exchange for safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, and their original third-rounder went to Denver last year when they traded up to No. 10. The ninth pick in the fifth round was in exchange for sending quarterback Josh Dobbs to Jacksonville, but then was traded to Miami in the Fitzpatrick deal (with No. 135 overall going to the Steelers). It was the original fifth-rounder, No. 162 overall, that went to Seattle in exchange for tight end Nick Vannett.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why the Steelers were slotted in at No. 17, No. 18 or No. 19 in alternating rounds, it’s because they tied with two other teams — Dallas and Chicago — in the overall standings last season. Once out of tiebreakers, the NFL rotates the choices by round, so without trades, the Steelers would have owned picks 18, 17, 19, 18, 17, 19 and 18, respectively.</p>
<p>Only two teams, Kansas City and New Orleans, have fewer draft picks than the Steelers in 2020 with five apiece. San Francisco, Arizona, Tennessee and the Los Angeles Rams also have six. Miami has the most selections with 14, followed by New England with 12.</p>
