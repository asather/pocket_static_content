<h1>Port Authority's BRT project remains highly rated by federal agency</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Despite substantial changes in the past year, Port Authority’s proposed Bus Rapid Transit system between Downtown Pittsburgh and Oakland continues to be rated highly by the Federal Transit Administration.</p>
<p>But the project isn’t ready for federal funding yet because the agency still is about $15 million short on its local share of about $125 million to qualify for $99.5 million in a federal Small Grants award.</p>
<p>Authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said Tuesday the agency is happy it has maintained its high rating for the project and is continuing to work on getting a commitment for the remaining money. The project, which will use exclusive bus lanes to provide more reliable service between the Golden Triangle and the hospital/education complex in Oakland, is in the final stage of design.</p>
<p>“Nothing that we have changed has changed the overall project rating,” Mr. Brandolph said. “It continues to be an extremely important project not only for our city but for our region.”</p>
<p>The $225 million project was among five of 33 Small Grants projects to be rated high in the FTA’s annual report on funding recommendations. A spokesman for the FTA speaking on background said the project is still in the development phase and the agency is working closely with Port Authority to meet “all legal and readiness requirements” before a grant can be approved.</p>
<p>“We have identified the vast majority of the money we need and we are working to get the final 12%,” Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>In the past year, the project has gone through substantial changes as Port Authority refines the proposal. For example, the agency announced last fall that the project would drop the proposed reconstruction of Fifth and Forbes avenues in the Uptown neighborhood that initially was part of the project because Pittsburgh officials said that wouldn’t be ready to proceed until 2025; reduced the number of electric buses from 25 to 15 due to cost; and added inbound and outbound stations at Bigelow Boulevard in Oakland at the request of disability advocates.</p>
<p>The changes raised the expected cost of the work from $195.5 million to $225 million, including an increase in reserves recommended by federal officials in case there are unexpected problems during construction.</p>
<p>The new system would have buses travel in exclusive lanes using Fifth Avenue inbound and Forbes Avenue outbound. From Oakland, the system will have wings that extend to Wilkinsburg via the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway, and to Squirrel Hill and Highland Park using intersections where buses will have signal priority.</p>
<p>Buses from the Monongahela Valley, eastern suburbs and East End also will use the BRT lanes. The project will include protected bike lanes on Fifth Avenue throughout, using the existing contraflow bus lane in Oakland.</p>

<p><em><strong>Correction, made at 3:45 p.m. Feb. 11:</strong> The cost of the project has since been updated by planners to total $225 million. An earlier version of this story contained an incorrect figure.</em></p>
