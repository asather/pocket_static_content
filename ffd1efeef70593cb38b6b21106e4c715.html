<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Rolling Stones have postponed their No Filter, which was to stop at Heinz Filed on June 23, due to concerns about the coronavirus.</p>
<p>It was to begin in San Diego on May 8 and wrap up on July 9 in Tampa. This would have been the first Stones show in Pittsburgh in five years.</p>
<p>The band released a statement saying:&nbsp;“We’re hugely disappointed to have to postpone the tour. We are sorry to all the fans who were looking forward to it as much as we were, but the health and safety of everyone has to take priority. We will all get through this together—and we’ll see you very soon.”</p>
