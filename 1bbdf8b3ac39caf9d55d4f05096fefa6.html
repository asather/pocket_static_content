<h1>Sen. Pat Toomey hosts YouTube forum on youth baseball and softball</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the 2020 Little League World Series was canceled at the end of April, it represented a tough reminder of the institutions that have been derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;But all might not be lost for Little League baseball and softball.</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., hosted a forum on his YouTube channel Thursday to discuss the status of youth baseball and softball. He was joined by former Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins, MLB’s executive vice president for baseball and softball development Tony Reagins, USA Softball Hall of Famer Jennie Finch, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of the Stanford School of Medicine and Stephen Keener, president and CEO of Little League International.</p>
<p>The participants all spoke to the importance they feel youth sports play in a young person’s life, while also bringing their own individual perspectives to the table.&nbsp;And the prognosis for Little League is generally positive, even if the leagues are still waiting to start up.</p>
<p>Most of Pennsylvania’s counties (37 of 67) are in the&nbsp;“yellow phase” of Gov. Tom Wolf’s reopening plan. Twelve others, including Beaver County, will move into that phase Friday. Youth sports activity cannot be “held or assembled” during the yellow phase, according to the <a href="https://www.pastatell.org/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Little League website</a>.</p>
<p>“If you think about all the sports that potentially could reopen, in my opinion, baseball and softball are among the top as likely the safest in that sense, in terms that you can impose some of these norms that we’ve come to expect for protecting one another from COVID infections.” Bhattacharya said.</p>
<p>That is a good thing, since the desire to resume youth baseball and softball has increased during this period of social isolation. Reagins noted an uptick in registration for MLB’s <a href="https://www.mlb.com/rbi/about" target="_blank">Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities</a> (RBI) program in hopes that athletes will be able to take part in games and practices this summer.</p>
<p>Keener, for his part, is helping to do everything he can to make sure that high interest from players and families is fostered. To help with that, Little League International, which is based in Williamsport, Pa., has spent time consulting medical professionals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and public health officials to construct guidelines for leagues around the country to return to play when it’s safe. That plan was sent out to Little League affiliates on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Additionally, the organization waived affiliation fees for 2020, allowing leagues to use that money to buy equipment or pay operating expenses.</p>
<p>“It’s been a stark reminder to us how important Little League baseball and Little League softball are to communities,” Keener said.&nbsp;“We’ve been hearing from our constituents and our affiliates since the middle of March about getting back on the field, how important this is to communities. But there are a lot of other important things going on that need to be addressed as well. So we’ve tried to balance putting the proper perspective in places that families, economies, businesses, everything needs to get up and running. But as soon as it’s safe to do so, that’s when we really want to go full steam ahead and get back on the playing field to play little league baseball and little league softball.”</p>
<p>Finch and Rollins have reached the very heights of their respective sports. They know the impact youth sports can have on a person, and as parents themselves, they know the potential effects the absence of youth leagues could have on kids. They’re hopeful that a return to play can help get kids active and interactive over the summer.</p>
<p>While some bigger events, like the Little League World Series, may be canceled by then, it seems there’s room for optimism for youth baseball and softball to begin at local levels at some point in the coming months.</p>
