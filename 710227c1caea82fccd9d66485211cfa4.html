<html><head><title>A Steelers fan's rooting guide to the 2019 NFL playoffs</title></head><body><p><em>The NFL playoffs begin Saturday, and the Steelers aren’t in them. That means you’ll have to pick another team or two to root for over the next month leading up to the 2020 Super Bowl on Feb. 2 in Miami Gardens, Fla. Here’s a guide to your choices.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>1. Buffalo —</strong> Steelers fans love tough defense and a smash-mouth running game. These Bills have both in addition to the lovable loser tag — this is just their second playoff appearance since 1999. That doesn’t mean they’re pushovers. They ranked third in total defense during the regular season, allowing just 298.2 yards per game, and quarterback Josh Allen’s athleticism pairs nicely in the running game with backs Devin Singletary and Frank Gore. This is an underdog you can put at least some faith in. At the very least, their&nbsp;“Bills Mafia” fan base is notoriously crazy and would be fun to watch on a run through the playoffs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Tennessee —</strong> If you can get past the fact that this is the team snatched the AFC’s sixth seed from the Steelers, it’s pretty likable. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill has been one of the league’s best comeback stories. He assumed the starting job from Marcus Mariota at midseason and hasn’t looked back, leading the Titans to wins in five of their last seven games. Pro Bowl back Derick Henry, meanwhile, has been the backbone of one of the best rushing attacks in the NFL. And oh, yeah. They face New England in the first round, so they’re a natural fit for Steelers fans.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Houston —</strong> The Texans finally got over the Patriots hump this season by beating the defending champs badly on Dec. 1. They also turned in a stinker of a loss against Baltimore a few weeks earlier. Such is the nature of Bill O’Brien’s mercurial squad. They could be Steelers fans’ best hope of seeing one of their top rivals lose in upset fashion. Or they could be the postseason doormat they’ve been for pretty much their entire history. You never really know what you’ll get in a given week, though they do have defensive end J.J. Watt’s <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28410412/texans-welcome-jj-watt-back-injured-reserve-vs-bills" target="_blank">return from injury</a> and the lethal passing game combo of quarterback DeShaun Watson and receiver DeAndre Hopkins going for them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Kansas City —</strong> The Chiefs don’t have much of the underdog pluck that the teams ahead of them on this list do. That comes with the territory of being one of the NFL’s best teams over the past couple of years. And Pro Bowl receiver Tyreek Hill is a tough guy to root for after multiple domestic violence investigations. Still, Patrick Mahomes is such great television. Tight end Travis Kelce is the most dominant player at his post-Rob Gronkowski position. And the defense? It might finally be decent enough to put the offensive standouts over the top. If you’re a Steelers fan, you can live with these guys coming out of the AFC.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Minnesota —</strong> The Vikings are a pretty vanilla team. Quarterback Kirk Cousins has been solid if unspectacular. The same could be said of running back Dalvin Cook, who pleased fantasy managers by scoring a lot of touchdowns while finishing 10th in rushing yards and 19th among qualified backs in per carry average. Receiver Stefon Diggs offered the only real flash as he averaged nearly 18 yards per reception en route to a 1,000-yard season. As a package, they’re inoffensive, which makes them one of the better choices in this field.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. Seattle —</strong> Running back Marshawn Lynch is back to meme up your timeline. Quarterback Russell Wilson just completed one of the better statistical seasons of his career. And receivers Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf have been an entertaining 1-2 punch in the passing game. Running back Chris Carson’s injury will hurt, but there’s a lot to like about this team if you can get past their fans’ endless mewling about the refs in the 2006 Super Bowl against the Steelers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7. New Orleans —</strong>&nbsp;The Saints got hosed by that missed pass interference call in the NFC championship last season, then immediately squandered any good will they may have been owed by acting like huge babies about it. One loser fan <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/09/07/saints-rams-lawsuit-brought-by-fan-dismissed-by-louisiana-supreme-court/" target="_blank">filed a lawsuit </a>over it. The local newspaper couldn’t let it go when the Los Angeles Rams lost the Super Bowl a couple of weeks later.&nbsp;</p><p>And the team itself whined so loudly that the NFL subjected the entire league to a season of a hackneyed pass interference replay review rule. Pass.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8. Green Bay —</strong> Running back Aaron Jones’ breakout has been neat to follow. He led the league in rushing touchdowns this season with 16. Let’s be real, though. This is still quarterback Aaron Rodgers’ show, and most of America has had enough of his stiff State Farm ads and the slobbering adulation he gets from seemingly every national commentator by now. Throw in <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2828649-what-happened-in-green-bay" target="_blank">unflattering reports</a> about his relationship with former coach and Pittsburgh native Mike McCarthy, who was ousted late last season, and he’s kind of a tough character to root for unless he’s facing one of the teams further down this list.</p><p><strong>9. San Francisco —</strong> If this were any other franchise, it would be easy to get behind. The 49ers’ turnaround from a 4-12 record in 2018 to the NFC’s No. 1 seed in 2019 has been one of the most impressive in recent memory. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo is a fresh face on the scene. Their pass rush, led by former first round pick Nick Bosa, is exhilarating. And how about that three-headed running game monster of&nbsp;Raheem Mostert, Matt Breida and Tevin Coleman? Here’s the problem. If the 49ers win, they tie the Steelers and Patriots’ record for Super Bowl victories with six. That rung on the ladder is crowded enough for Steelers fans’ liking as it is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>10. Baltimore —</strong> Admit it. You wouldn’t loathe seeing this division rival win as much as you have in the past. Quarterback Lamar Jackson is a breakout star. He’s electrifying to watch. The villains of Steelers-Ravens rivalry games past — Ed Reed, Ray Lewis, Terrell Suggs, etc. — are all gone. Sure, they’re still far from your top choice, but deep down, you know they’re the best hope to stop New England from getting to seven rings, and you’ll take a Baltimore Super Bowl win if that’s what it takes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>11. Philadelphia —</strong> Nope. Not again. The underdog Eagles were Pittsburgh’s default choice for their 2018 Super Bowl win against the hated Patriots. Then their fans predictably <a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/philadelphia-post-super-bowl-lii-celebration-was-really-a-riot/" target="_blank">lost their minds</a>.</p><p>And that’s just the chaos we can show you that didn’t include cursing and consumption of horse crap! Since then, their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/super-bowl-lii/no-one-likes-us-philly-jason-kelce-chant-philadelphia-eagles-parade-origins-20180209.html" target="_blank">“no one likes us, and we don’t care”</a> routine has been one of the most insufferable things in football. Let your intrastate hate flow once again.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>12. New England — </strong>...</p><p><em>Adam Bittner: abittner@post-gazette.com and Twitter @fugimaster24.&nbsp;</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/03/nfl-playoffs-wild-card-weekend-pittsburgh-steelers-fans/stories/202001030105</original_url>
