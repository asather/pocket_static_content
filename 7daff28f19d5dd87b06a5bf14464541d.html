<h1>Steelers preseason schedule finalized with all dates and times</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>We now know that Aug. 14 will be Tom Brady Day in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>OK, maybe not, but that is the date that Brady is set to suit up for his first game with his new team — assuming you consider the Tampa Bay Buccaneers facing the Steelers at Heinz Field for an exhibition counts.</p>
<p>The full preseason schedule is now set with dates and times for the Steelers, the team announced Thursday morning. Two games did not have a set date when the NFL released its full slate last week, the second and fourth preseason matchups with Tampa Bay and the New York Jets. Below are the five exhibition games the Steelers may or may not actually play in 2020:</p>
<p><strong>Aug. 6</strong> – Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio vs. Dallas, 8 p.m. (WPXI)</p>
<p>Week 1 (Aug. 14) – Tampa Bay, 7:30 p.m. (KDKA)</p>
<p>Week 2 (Aug. 23) – New Orleans, 8 p.m. (FOX)</p>
<p>Week 3 (Aug. 28) – at New York Jets, 7:30 p.m. (KDKA)</p>
<p>Week 4 (Sept. 3) – at Carolina 7:30 p.m. (KDKA)</p>
