<h1>Amtrak reducing service on several Northeast and long-distance routes</h1>

<p>Amtrak will reduce service on several Northeast routes due to decreased ridership caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, but an Amtrak spokeswoman said the daily Pittsburgh-to-New York City “Pennsylvanian” route will not be affected.</p>
<p>Amtrak announced the changes in a statement published to its website Wednesday. Twenty-three routes in the Northeast will see a reduced schedule, including the Keystone Service commuter route from Harrisburg to New York City, which will now only run between Harrisburg and Philadelphia. That route is managed in coordination with PennDOT.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvanian begins daily at Pittsburgh’s Union Station and makes stops in Johnstown, Altoona, Harrisburg and Philadelphia before terminating in New York City. The trip takes about nine hours.</p>
<p>“Due to the long-term impact of COVID-19 on ridership, Amtrak has made the decision to operate with reduced capacity through [fiscal year 2021],” said Beth Toll, an Amtrak spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Amtrak also will reduce service on its long-distance routes from daily service to three days per week beginning Oct. 1. One of these routes, the “Capitol Limited” between Washington D.C., and Chicago, stops in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“As we have already made adjustments to our Northeast Corridor and state-supported services, the next adjustment is with our long-distance trains, which we plan to reduce to three days per week, beginning October 1, 2020. Our goal is to restore daily service on these routes as demand warrants, potentially by the summer of 2021,” Ms. Toll said.</p>
<p>It’s not good news to local rail advocacy group Western Pennsylvanians for Passenger Rail (WPPR), which has pushed for more rail service to the area, not less.</p>
<p>“We would really like to see daily service retained if possible,” said Mark Spada of WPPR. “It’s tougher to put trips together with no daily service.”</p>
<p>Mr. Spada noted that several towns on the long distance routes do not have or have reduced service by air or Greyhound bus. The only way to reach them besides driving is through passenger rail.</p>
<p>Amtrak first announced service adjustments back in March. Since then, many routes have been fully or partially restored.</p>
<p>Amtrak’s finances have been heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. On May 26, the company submitted a letter to Congress asking for an additional $1.475 billion in supplemental funding to “operate minimum service levels” on its routes.</p>
<p>Amtrak is looking to reduce its spending by $500 million this year and is only expecting ridership to return to 50 percent in the 2021 fiscal year.</p>
