<h1>Jim Leyland on Derek Shelton: 'I see some of myself in him'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Derek Shelton mentioned it a few sentences into his introductory press conference, before he even took questions, describing himself "a very poor minor league catcher." Little jabs have followed, with the new Pirates manager garnering laughs by poking fun at his ability — or lack of it.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">One of the Pirates pillars Shelton idolizes most is Jim Leyland, the former skipper who hit just .222 over seven minor league seasons in the Tigers organization. Both were catchers, and neither sniffed the major leagues as players.</span></p>
<p>Which is one reason why the two have quickly struck up a pretty neat friendship, one that started with a private breakfast at Chartiers Country Club a couple days before Shelton’s introductory press conference and has continued to this day.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I’m really pulling hard for him because I see some of myself in him,” Leyland said. “Guys like us, we have to gain the players’ respect. If you’re a former big league player, someone who’s a pretty big name and people know who you are, those managers have to lose the players’ respect.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Leyland kept tabs on what Shelton seemed to accomplish in spring training, when things were lighter, players seemed to smile again, and baseball felt fun. The two talked a few times, too, the most recent at Joker Marchant Stadium, when the Pirates played the Tigers in the next-to-last game before COVID-19 halted everything.</span></p>
<p><span>While Leyland likes Shelton a lot, he also called himself a “big Clint Hurdle fan.” Leyland insisted Hurdle “never got enough credit for being the good game manager that he was” and praised&nbsp;Hurdle for his leadership and motivation.</span></p>
<p>But there’s definitely a kinship with Shelton, Leyland said, the result of them being a pair of not-so-great catchers who’ve earned their stripes the hard way.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“That’s a good feeling if you think you [earned the players’ respect],” Leyland said. “I know he’s going to accomplish that.”</span></p>
<p>Shelton hasn’t been shy about asking for advice or coming to the former Pirates skipper with questions, which Leyland called “flattering.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">They also weren’t questions designed to make Leyland feel good or stroke his ego. “They were genuinely good questions,” Leyland said, declining to divulge much more.</span></p>
<p>“I told him how I felt about what he asked,” Leyland explained. “I said, ‘You put that into your own personality. If you don’t like it, discard it.’ But we have a great relationship. I look forward to the season starting and seeing him some ... without getting in his hair.”</p>
<p><strong>Another plan</strong></p>
<p>Major League Baseball is considering an amended version of its Arizona plan, according to USA Today's Bob Nightengale. Citing sources, Nightengale wrote Friday that MLB is kicking around the idea of using the Grapefruit (Florida) and Cactus (Arizona) Leagues to replace the American and National Leagues for 2020.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Under the potential plan, teams would return to their spring training sites and play only the teams that they do in spring. Nightengale cited one realignment structure that had the Pirates in a division with the Yankees, Phillies, Blue Jays and Tigers.</span></p>
<p>The plan would include three weeks of spring training, and games would not be played in front of fans. Grapefruit League travel could be interesting, as spring training cities in Florida are separated, in some cases, by as much as 220 miles.</p>
<p><span>If this particular plan would go through, one rule change would be the universal implementation of the designated hitter, while playoff structure would be expanded in some way.</span></p>
<p>The same as Arizona, TV would be a huge thing, with games appearing at several different time slots throughout the day. The schedule would also include regular doubleheaders.</p>
<p><strong>Show time</strong></p>
<p>With no baseball games to watch, fans can at least see 30 players representing each major league club competing virtually in an “MLB The Show” Players League.</p>
<p>Competition begins Friday with Tampa’s Blake Snell taking on Cincinnati’s Amir Garrett at 9 p.m. Fans can watch streams of games on a variety of digital platforms, including Twitch and YouTube.</p>
<p>Cole Tucker will represent the Pirates. Major League Baseball, the MLBPA and Sony Interactive Entertainment will together donate $5,000 on behalf of each participating player to a Boys &amp; Girls Club affiliate in their team’s community. The winner will raise an additional $25,000 for that Boys &amp; Girls Club affiliate.</p>
<p>The regular season will be a round-robin format, with everybody playing each other at least once throughout April. Games will last three innings, and the top eight teams after the regular season will advance to the playoffs.</p>
