<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The municipality of Mt. Lebanon has once again been designated as a Keystone Main Street through the state Department of Community and Economic Development’s Keystone Communities Program. </p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon has been a designated Keystone Main Street community for more than a decade, according to Eric Milliron, Mt. Lebanon’s economic development and commercial districts manager.</p>
<p>The Keystone Main Street program is designed to encourage partnerships between the public and private sectors that jointly support local initiatives such as the growth of stability of neighborhoods and communities as well as social and economic diversity and a strong, secure quality of life.</p>
<p>“Mt. Lebanon’s designation as a Keystone Main Street allows us to receive priority consideration for several grants available via the Department of Community and Economic Development,” Mr. Milliron said.</p>
<p>Such grants could be used to fund Mt. Lebanon’s $3.8 million “vibrant uptown” project, which was one of several priority matters identified by the municipality last year.</p>
<p>In November, Mt. Lebanon officials presented information on the project, which stands to be a multiyear effort that includes streetscape improvements along Washington Road and renovations and improvements to Parse Way behind Mt. Lebanon’s light rail station. Five principals for the project have been identified by a steering committee: accessibility, connectivity, sustainability, inclusivity and innovation.</p>
<p>“We are moving along nicely with the project,” Mr. Milliron said. “We recently reached out to subject experts in the realms of accessibility and placemaking/​urban design to ensure that our project is taking full advantage of this opportunity to enhance the uptown district.” </p>
