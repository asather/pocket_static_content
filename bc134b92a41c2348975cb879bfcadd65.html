<h1>Duquesne in need of a win as No. 7 Dayton comes to town</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Duquesne will welcome No. 7 Dayton to Pittsburgh on Wednesday. The Flyers&nbsp;will be the highest-ranked team the Dukes have hosted since No. 1 Massachusetts in 1996.</p>
<p>That, in and of itself, would be enough to call it a big game for Duquesne.</p>
<p>The timing of the game emphasizes that notion even more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dukes (15-4 overall, 5-2 A10) are fresh off two straight losses to Rhode Island and the Minutemen. Duquesne’s record is still good, to be sure, but when you combine the way the season started, the early talk of potential for an NCAA tournament qualification and the teams it still has to play, this team needs to string some wins together again to get back on track.</p>
<p>“We need a win,” coach Keith Dambrot said Tuesday.&nbsp;“Obviously anytime you beat a good team, it helps your program, and we recruit Ohio hard, so it would help us. We probably still couldn’t beat [Dayton] on [any recruits] because of their 13,000 fan support they get every night. But we need a win, regardless of whether it’s Dayton or the worst team in America. But obviously, you beat a top 10 team, then people will say,&nbsp;‘Well, maybe they are pretty good.’ ”</p>
<p>The challenge with Dayton (18-2, 7-0) this season is just how deep and experienced it is. The Flyers are led by National Player of the Year candidate Obi Toppin, who averages 19.7 points and 8.0 rebounds a game. His stock skyrocketed in the beginning of the season when he averaged 22.3 points per game in the Maui Invitational, including an 18-point outing against Kansas in the championship game.</p>
<p>And while Toppin casts a large shadow, the players around him are plenty capable. Junior point guard Jalen Crutcher has scored at least 20 points in each of his last four games, winning A10 Player of the Week each of the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Fifth-year senior forward Ryan Mikesell, senior guard Trey Landers and redshirt junior guard Rodney Chatman round out the starting lineup. Redshirt junior wing Ibi Watson, who transferred to Dayton after playing at Michigan for two years, is the Flyers’ sixth man, and he averages 12 points per game and shoots 45% from 3, the 51st-best clip of any player in the country.</p>
<p>All of that combines to form a team that scores the second-most points per game nationally with 83.2. That number will win a lot of games.</p>
<p>“They have a very simple system but a very good system for what they have,” Dambrot said.&nbsp;“It’s quite obvious to me we’re not winning if the game’s in the 80s because we haven’t been capable of scoring 80, and they’re capable of getting 80. So if it’s a fast game, they’re gonna kick our ass.”</p>
<p>And, at all costs, Duquesne must avoid that to get things going back in the right direction. It isn’t like a loss on Wednesday would ruin the Dukes’ season. It is against the best team in the conference after all.</p>
<p>It’s more that Duquesne’s season has become one in which people are waiting to figure out if the Dukes are good enough to achieve heights they haven’t reached in a long time. After last week’s unsuccessful road trip, some doubts might be creeping in.</p>
<p>Duquesne has shown an ability to bounce back from tough stretches already this season. In the Dukes’ last two non-conference games, back in December, they lost to UAB and Marshall consecutively, then strung together five straight wins to build some belief.</p>
<p>Now, after another two-game losing streak, they’ll try to do that again. Only this time, the No. 7 team in the country stands in the way.</p>
<p>For their part, Dambrot and his players are on the same wavelength, agreeing that they’re treating it as they would any other game.</p>
<p>But to many, it will be a measuring stick against the cream of the crop.</p>
