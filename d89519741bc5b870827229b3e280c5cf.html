<h1>Police take 3rd suspect in custody for shooting death of Spring Hill 1-year-old</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A third suspect in the shooting death of 1-year-old Zykier Young is now in police custody.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police said Tuesday that Devon Thompson, 37, of McKees Rocks, turned himself in and was arrested on charges including homicide, attempted homicide, aggravated assault and firearms not to be carried without a license.</p>
<p>Two other suspects — Andre Crawford, 29, of McKeesport, and Marvin Hill Jr., 41, of Spring Hill — are in custody and are also facing homicide and gun charges.</p>
<p>Zykier was killed last month when a bullet fired outside traveled through a window and two walls and struck him in the head while he slept inside his home on the 100 block of Rhine Place in Spring Hill.</p>
<p>The baby was caught in the crossfire during a shootout between the three men, according to Thompson’s criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Police said they notified of five ShotSpotter alerts around 6 p.m. on Aug. 24 near the Three Rivers Apartment Complex. Another 12 rounds were reported in the same area by ShotSpotter alerts only minutes later.</p>
<p>Police also received multiple 911 calls from witnesses who described the scene as a “gun war” and said “they’re killing each other; gunshots everywhere,” according to the criminal complaint.</p>
<p>After being notified of a possible victim inside the nearby apartments, responding officers found Zykier’s mother holding the baby in her arms as he bled from his head.</p>
<p>Zykier was then immediately taken for emergency medical care by the officers — who also administered aid in the back of their patrol car — but the child ultimately died at the hospital.</p>
<p>Video surveillance footage, combined with several accounts from witnesses, helped police identify Thompson, Crawford and Hill, according to the complaint. The men had gotten into an argument that led to gunfire in a parking lot just outside the apartment where the 1-year-old lived.</p>
<p>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich called the shooting “a senseless crime that didn’t have to occur” at a press conference announcing the charges brought against Crawford and Hill on Sept. 4.</p>
<p>“Nothing will bring this child back.” Mr. Hissrich said. “However, hopefully there will be some sense of relief to the family, to the neighborhood, that individuals have been taken off the street before they do another crime.”</p>
