<h1>Counties say Pa. set restrictions on possible Trump event while car shows with thousands go on</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In one last legal filing that they hope proves to the court that Pennsylvania officials have treated commercial speech differently than political speech in their pandemic-related restrictions on social gatherings, lawyers representing four Western Pennsylvania counties invoked the name of President Donald Trump this week.</p>
<p>The lawyers for Butler, Fayette, Greene and Washington counties&nbsp;— as well as businesses and Republican candidates there —&nbsp;wrote that while car shows and similar events in Carlisle have been permitted to exceed the 250-person limit on outdoor gatherings, Mr. Trump was "warned" by Gov. Tom Wolf that he couldn't have more than 250 people present if he were to give his GOP nomination speech in Gettysburg, as was rumored.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Trump ultimately chose the White House as the venue to give his speech to the Republican National Convention this week, the plaintiffs in the local suit claim the governor's statements were indicative of how candidates are unfairly treated&nbsp;— and their political speech unfairly limited&nbsp;— by the state's restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>They alleged that as political speech is limited, a Corvette show in Carlisle in August&nbsp;— which is anticipated to bring "thousands of collector and classic automotive enthusiasts" to the fairgrounds, they say&nbsp;— will be permitted. Citing another example, they point to Kennywood Park, claiming that it's permitted to exceed outdoor congregation limits.</p>
<p>The office of state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, representing defendants Mr. Wolf and Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine, responded in a brief that the plaintiffs' request to include these facts does not meet legal standards for evidence because they are "subject to reasonable dispute."</p>
<p>Among them, Mr. Shapiro's office said the upcoming Carlisle car show is permitted to operate at 50 percent capacity as a "flea market," a designation that's been subject to different guidelines because flea markets don't involve individuals congregating for "discrete events or shows," a health department spokeswoman told the Post-Gazette last week.</p>
<p>Congregate limits are applicable to "events and gatherings," the attorney general's office added, and do not apply to "regular business operations." Kennywood, too, is permitted to operate at only a 50% capacity, the brief claimed.</p>
<p>As for the plaintiffs’ claim that their county fairs had to cancel because they couldn’t possibly adhere to the gathering restrictions, Mr. Shapiro’s office rebutted that&nbsp;“a fair is an&nbsp;‘event or gathering’ subject to the congregate limit.”</p>
<p>The attorney general's filing did not directly comment on the issue of political speech or, specifically, the governor’s reaction to Mr. Trump's rumored speech.</p>
<p>The intent of the plaintiffs’ new filing was to add evidence to their overall claim that the state’s business closure orders were&nbsp;“arbitrary, capricious and&nbsp;interfered with the concept of 'ordered liberty' as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment," among other allegations of unconstitutionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, who will give his acceptance speech from Washington on Thursday, had said earlier this month that his campaign was&nbsp;“looking at” Gettysburg as a possible venue. He also said the White House would be&nbsp;“very much easier for Secret Service” and would cost less.</p>
<p>Asked if he’d have an audience for his speech, Mr. Trump said,&nbsp;“You could. You have plenty of room at both locations.”</p>
<p>When Mr. Trump first tweeted about Gettysburg as an option, Mr. Wolf released a statement, saying that all gatherings — including those on federal land —&nbsp;“should abide by the Commonwealth’s restrictions, which have proven to mitigate COVID-19.”</p>
<p>“We hope and expect that the President will abide by these commonsense restrictions that will protect the health and safety of the community around Gettysburg and throughout Pennsylvania,” the statement read, referring to limits on large gatherings and face mask requirements.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the counties suing the state also insinuate that Mr. Trump’s speech should have been allowed to a crowd of more than 250 if a separate car show in Carlisle — held this past June — was permitted to occur.</p>
<p>They’re referring to the contents of a confidential settlement — unearthed in their suit last week — between the state and Carlisle car show organizers, in which the state agreed to allow the Carlisle event to proceed as long as no more than 20,000 people were on the fairgrounds at one time. Organizers also had to&nbsp;“enforce all applicable&nbsp;social distancing, masking, area cleaning and hygiene requirements,” according to the settlement.</p>
<p>Lyndsay Kensinger, a spokeswoman for the governor, said in a statement to the Post-Gazette on Tuesday that the administration has been&nbsp;“consistent” on restrictions, and that the health department&nbsp;“is pleased to have worked with&nbsp;Carlisle Events to improve its efforts to protect Spring Carlisle vendors and patrons and the public from COVID-19.”</p>
<p>"All such similar events must adhere to the existing mitigation orders and, as flea markets, have always been permitted under the Green phase of reopening," Ms. Kensinger said, adding that&nbsp;“the orders provide different restrictions for different activities” and flea markets are capped at 50 percent capacity at least.</p>
