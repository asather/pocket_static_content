<h1>Elizabeth Forward football practice on hold after possible COVID-19 exposure</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Elizabeth Forward High School football team has been shut down because of a possible exposure to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Forward superintendent Todd Keruskin said, “We’re looking at starting back up next Friday.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Keruskin sent a letter to Elizabeth Forward parents of players, informing them of their child’s possible exposure. The letter said, “your child should stay home from school/practice and quarantine for 14 days since Aug. 13, the last day we believe your child was possibly exposed to the virus.”</p>
<p>Keruskin said the school district notified the Allegheny County Health Department of the issue.</p>
<p>“There is a standard rule of working with the county health department,” Keruskin said. “I’m not sure of the comments other people are making, but the health department will walk you through this. They will tell you what you should do, how to self-quarantine for 14 days, how to monitor students and so forth. There is a protocol to follow. School districts aren’t doing everything on their own.”</p>
<p>The shutdown would put the Elizabeth Forward team a little behind in practices, if the football season is played. The PIAA will vote Friday afternoon on whether football and other fall sports will be conducted.</p>
<p>If the football season is played, heat acclimatization practices are scheduled to start Monday. Under PIAA rules, which the WPIAL follows, teams must go through five consecutive days of heat practices before they can start official practices in full pads. Elizabeth Forward would start heat practices Aug. 28.</p>
<p>If the football season is played, WPIAL teams can start playing games Sept. 10.</p>
