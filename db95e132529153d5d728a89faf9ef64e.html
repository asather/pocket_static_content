<h1>Levin family to buy back iconic furniture business</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Levin Furniture is returning to its namesake owners, the company announced Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Robert Levin, previous president of Levin’s, told the company’s 1,200 employees that the family is reacquiring the furniture store from Art Van, whose parent firm is currently considering filing for bankruptcy. In the deal, Levin’s also is acquiring Wolf Furniture, which targets the Virginia and Maryland markets as well as Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“I’m coming back as the owner of Levin Furniture for the employees who were at risk of losing their jobs,” said Mr. Levin, who had been retired.</p>
<p>Levin employees, he said,&nbsp;“are the most loyal, dedicated, and hardworking people I’ve ever known. It will be a privilege and honor to once again lead this company as we prepare to celebrate 100 years in the furniture and mattress business.”</p>
<p>Levin sold its 33 stores in November 2017 to Warren, Mich.-based Art Van, which called itself “the Midwest’s No. 1 furniture and mattress retailer,” but the new owner has seen its share of turmoil since the death of founder Art Van Elslander in February 2018.</p>
<p>That same month, then-President and CEO Kim Yost announced his retirement from Art Van. His successor, Ronald Boire, a former CEO with Barnes &amp; Noble, left the company last August.</p>
<p>By then, Art Van had been acquired by a private equity firm which, according to a report in Crain’s Detroit last month, is considering selling the company or possibly filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The re-acquisition of Levin Furniture brings both new life and a new chapter to the company that was founded in 1920 by Robert Levin’s grandfather, Sam.</p>
<p>The original store in Mount Pleasant sold hardware and furniture “where customers could buy everything from flyswatters and expandable window screens to three piece ‘parlor suites,’” according to the company’s website.</p>
<p>Sam’s son Leonard joined the business in 1943, followed by his son, Howard, in 1978.</p>
<p>Howard, who became president following his father’s death in 1989, brought Levin’s to the Pittsburgh and Cleveland markets before his untimely death in 1993 at age 40. Robert, who was living in Washington, D.C., then returned to Pittsburgh to take over operation of the family’s furniture store business.</p>
