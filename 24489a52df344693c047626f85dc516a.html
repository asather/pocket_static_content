<h1>No drama in reopening for Dormont's Hollywood Theater </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While most movie marquees in Pittsburgh are touting reopenings later this month, the Hollywood Theater in Dormont has been screening movies for in-person viewing since June 5.</p>
<p>Given the COVID-19 green phase go-ahead for June 3, the 95-year-old Hollywood Theater opened its doors on Friday, June 5, with social-distancing restrictions in place.</p>
<p>The Hollywood has nearly 400 seats total, but only 125 available after closing the balcony and offering seats in every other row, while also asking patrons to keep two seats between parties.</p>
<p>The wearing of masks is requested but not required, said shift supervisor Ian Spottiswood, 15 minutes before the 4 p.m. showing Tuesday of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.” A 7:45 p.m. screening of “Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban” was to follow.</p>
<p>The first post-COVID-19 film to be screened at the theater was “The Wretched,” a 2019 drama about a teenage boy who faces off with a thousand-year-old witch posing as his neighbor</p>
<p>That was followed by the “The Goonies” and, currently, the “Harry Potter” films. July 31 is the fictional boy wizard’s birthday, so he is often feted with film festivals around this time.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter” fans will find that the theater has a marked flow of audience members to and from the lobby and bathrooms.</p>
<p>Most people have been buying their tickets at the door, and 16 is the most to have attended a single screening.</p>
<p>“It is understandably very slow,” he said.</p>
<p>Neither the website, <a href="https://www.hollywoodtheaterpgh.org/," target="_blank">www.hollywoodtheaterpgh.org,</a> nor the phone’s voicemail for the theater contains a message about restrictions at the 95-year-old theater.</p>
<p>Manager Mallory Walsh said the theater was working on “the maze of a phone system” to get all of the information to patrons. However, neither the box office nor the phones are manned before the first screening of the day.</p>
<p>“People who have questions mostly walk up and ask,” Ms. Walsh said.</p>
<p>Dale Abraham, who volunteers as the Hollywood’s organ player for 30 minutes before the first Friday evening screening at the Hollywood, said he has seen people wearing masks in the lobby, and that social distancing in the audience has been “easy,” because the screenings where he plays have not been well attended.</p>
<p>Another community movie theater, the Tull Family Theater in Sewickley, announced on Tuesday that its reopening would be delayed — not due to further COVID-19 concerns or restrictions, but because of a delay in the release of first-run offerings.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Tull said, “As the West Coast closed for business on Friday, the film industry announced postponing two films critical to the reopening schedules of cinemas nationwide. The release of “Unhinged” with Russell Crowe was delayed from July 3 to July 10, and Christopher Nolan’s highly anticipated “Tenet” was pushed from July 17 to July 31.”</p>
<p>The Tull said it would announce an opening date “within days, as it confers with industry partners.” The theater continues to offer films in virtual screening rooms, including a live Q&amp;A with the documentary “Picture a Scientist,”; details at <a href="http://www.thetullfamilytheater.org." target="_blank">www.thetullfamilytheater.org.</a></p>
