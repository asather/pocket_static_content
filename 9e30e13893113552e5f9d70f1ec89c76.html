<h1>PennDOT, turnpike to cut road projects because of revenue shortfalls related to COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Leaders of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and Pennsylvania Turnpike painted a picture of future road and bridge projects Tuesday as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it wasn’t pretty.</p>
<p>With a loss of revenue projected at as much as $900 million for PennDOT because of extremely reduced driving cutting gasoline tax revenue, Acting Secretary Yassmin Gramain&nbsp;told a state Senate hearing her agency will shift maintenance projects from resurfacing to tar-and-chipping where possible. She said only 33 of 96 contracts the agency has received bids for worth $380 million this construction season currently have funding and the rest are being re-evaluated.</p>

<p>Turnpike CEO Mark Compton said&nbsp;extremely light traffic due to stay-at-home orders related to the pandemic are projected to cost the agency $400 million to $500 million in toll revenue. As a result, the turnpike has cut its capital budget for the fiscal year that starts June 1 from $606 million to $459 million and will delay changes as part of its shift to cashless tolling for two years.</p>
<p>Ms. Gramain said PennDOT is&nbsp;“transitioning to a new normal” as a result of the revenue losses. Unless safety is involved, she said, projects that can be reduced from full reconstruction or replacement for roads and bridges will be reduced to extending the lives of existing facilities. The likely will mean tarring and chipping some roads and rehabilitating existing bridges rather than replacing them.</p>
<p>“Some of those non-essential contracts we put on hold for the time being,” Ms. Gramain said.&nbsp;“Many of the ways we did business may be changed forever.”</p>
<p>Ms. Gramain said putting off needed work&nbsp;“isn’t the best” practice, but Executive Deputy Secretary George McAuley said the agency is&nbsp;“buying time” until more money is available.</p>
<p>“It makes sense to preserve these conditions for now, but it’s not a long-term solution,” Mr. McAuley said.</p>
<p>In addition, some contractors will have to wait longer for payments because of the agency’s cash-flow problem. Mr. McAuley said there often is a delay of about a month at the beginning of the state’s fiscal year July 1, but that will begin sooner this year.</p>
<p>“We are limited in what revenue we have,” he said.&nbsp;“Contractors will be paid. It is a challenging time.”</p>
<p>Ms. Gramain said PennDOT isn’t sure what it will do if the turnpike is unable to make its quarterly $112.5 million payments to PennDOT for public transit. PennDOT has agreed to delay the July payment but it’s unclear whether the turnpike will be able to make that payment late or resume regular payments in October.</p>
<p>“If they can’t make payments… we need to review the program and see how we can fund it,” she said.&nbsp;“I don’t have an answer right now.”</p>
<p>At the turnpike, Mr. Compton said the agency expects to cut 25% of its capital budget for the new fiscal year. It will continue projects that already started, but some new projects won’t begin, he said.</p>
<p>One project that will take a hit is part of the agency’s conversion to cashless tolling. The agency still will be eliminating cash toll payments by October 2021, but it will push back replacing toll booths with the installation of overhead gantries to read E-ZPass transponders or license plates to send drivers a toll bill by two years until 2024, Mr. Compton said.</p>
<p>Those dire projections could change if Congress comes through with a national infrastructure program or stimulus money for toll agencies. Ms. Gramain said PennDOT could receive $700 million this year and $1.3 billion next year if a bill currently under consideration approved.</p>
<p>“We have started looking at what are the big projects we want push out now [if stimulus money is approved,” she said, noting the agency may want to replace money from local roads that it has shifted to interstate highways in the past year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We don’t know what kind of strings will be attached to that money. It doesn’t matter. We will figure it out.”</p>
