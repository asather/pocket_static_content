<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Catholic newspaper, which has been distributed weekly since 1844, has &nbsp;suspended operations until further notice amid the increasing shutdowns due to the coronavirus and COVID-19.</p>
<p>The newspaper is the official publication of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>“An email was sent to diocesan employees Thursday explaining that the Pittsburgh Catholic newspaper will suspend operations effective immediately and until further notice,” said Ellen Mady, chancellor for the Diocese of Pittsburgh. “This action is necessary since there is no distribution given the suspension of Masses in the Diocese of Pittsburgh due to coronavirus (COVID-19) concerns.”</p>
<p>Bishop David Zubik this week suspended Masses and other activities, such as midweek devotional services and Lenten fish fries, to reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>According to the publication’s website, the Pittsburgh Catholic was launched on April 6, 1844 by Bishop Michael O’Connor, the first bishop of the diocese.</p>
<p>He stated its purpose as follows: “This paper will be devoted particularly to an exposition and defense of Catholic principles, but will contain also a varied selection of articles on miscellaneous subjects and foreign news. All domestic party politics shall be carefully avoided.”</p>
