<p>Allegheny County police arrested two men in after finding over a thousand stamp bags of heroin in a Braddock home with children in it.</p>
<p>James Wise, 28, and Brandon Balthrop, 31, were arrested after narcotics detectives executed a search warrant at&nbsp;613 Corey Avenue. Authorities seized 1,650 individual stamp bags of heroin and fentanyl, a stolen .380 caliber handgun, a small quantity of marijuana and $3,175 in cash, according to a release from police.</p>
<p>Two children, ages four and seven, were in the home while the warrant was served, the release says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Balthrop and Wise were charged with&nbsp;felony possession with intent to deliver, receiving stolen property and endangering the welfare of children.</p>
<p>Under a state statute, Wise was not allowed to possess a firearm due to a prior felony drug arrest and conviction, police said. He was out of jail on bond after he was arrested at the same house in December.</p>
<p>During that arrest, detectives found heroin and fentanyl, a stolen 9mm handgun, and $2,700 in cash, according to county police.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Balthrop and Wise on Friday were placed in the Allegheny County Jail awaiting preliminary arraignments.</p>
<p>Their preliminary hearing is set for March 24.&nbsp;</p>
