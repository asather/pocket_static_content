<h1>Feds portray arrested Troy Hill man as obsessed with mass shootings</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An unemployed Troy Hill felon portrayed&nbsp;by the government as being obsessed with mass shootings and Nazis was&nbsp;ordered detained Friday pending trial on a charge that he illegally&nbsp;possessed an assault-style gun.</p>
<p>Dennis A. Riggs, 50, had seven guns,&nbsp;ammunition and numerous bladed weapons in his house, according to testimony in U.S. District Court by an FBI agent working with a domestic terrorism task force.</p>
<p>Riggs is barred from owning guns and ammunition because of a 1994&nbsp;conviction in Allegheny County for aggravated assault, a felony.</p>
<p>Agent Troy Jeffers described the decor of Riggs’ Hatteras Street home&nbsp;as having a Nazi theme, with framed portraits throughout his house of&nbsp;Adolf Hitler, the Nazi eagle symbol and images of&nbsp;swastikas.</p>
<p>Agents executing a search warrant Wednesday as part of an ongoing&nbsp;investigation found the guns, ammunition and what Magistrate Judge&nbsp;Lisa Pupo Lenihan described as “excessive” amounts of alcohol.</p>
<p>A search of Riggs’ cellphone turned up video of him — played in court&nbsp;— in a shirt with a swastika emblem loading an assault-style rifle and&nbsp;giving the sieg heil Nazi salute.</p>
<p>Also on his phone, according to Agent Jeffers: the live-streamed video&nbsp;of the March 2019 mass shooting at a Christchurch, New Zealand, mosque&nbsp;and a picture of Dylann Roof, the mass shooter in the 2015 massacre at&nbsp;a Charleston, S.C., church, along with his federal prison contact&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>Numerous photos of Riggs holding guns were on the phone, including one of an&nbsp;AR-15 assault-style rifle lying on a Nazi banner and another of the gun atop camouflage pants with multiple rounds of ammunition strewn about.</p>
<p>As the court displayed the exhibits, Riggs — portly, bespectacled and&nbsp;wearing a red jail uniform — craned his neck to see.</p>
<p>Riggs has a valid passport and has traveled to the United Kingdom,&nbsp;Germany and Hungary — most recently tracking overseas in November.</p>
<p>The government asked for Riggs’ detention both because prosecutors believe that he poses a&nbsp;flight risk and is a danger to the community.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Smolar noted that Riggs was arrested&nbsp;in 2005 by Pittsburgh police for threatening a neighbor with a gun&nbsp;during a confrontation in which he used racial slurs.</p>
<p>In that incident, Pittsburgh police said Riggs announced that "he was&nbsp;ridding the Catholic neighborhood of blacks."</p>
<p>At the time, Riggs displayed a Nazi flag on his mantel and bragged to&nbsp;neighbors that his friends called him Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>Riggs was involuntarily committed for psychiatric treatment and the&nbsp;charges — ethnic intimidation and simple assault —&nbsp;were dismissed.</p>
<p>In the current case, Riggs is accused of illegally obtaining the&nbsp;AR-15 in 2018 through a straw purchase at a Washington County gun shop&nbsp;by his significant other.</p>
<p>But the government, clearly, sees a bigger problem&nbsp;and is concerned that Riggs has all the makings of a potential mass shooter.</p>
<p>Thomas Livingston, a federal public defender, argued that the only&nbsp;thing his client had done with the gun since 2018 was to pose with it&nbsp;for videos. He also said that Riggs was under care of the Veterans&nbsp;Administration and acknowledged that his client had mental health,&nbsp;alcohol and medical issues.</p>
<p>Judge Lenihan said she did not need to hear the prosecution’s argument&nbsp;to hold Riggs.</p>
<p>Her mind was made up based on the evidence, including the “very&nbsp;concerning” 2005 arrest, the weapons, the “significant amount” of Nazi&nbsp;paraphernalia, his overseas travel, the videos “apparently paying&nbsp;homage to Adolf Hitler” — and the mass shooting imagery.</p>
