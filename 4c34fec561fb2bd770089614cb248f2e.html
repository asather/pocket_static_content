<h1>PennDOT resumes driver skills tests, issues COVID-19 safety protocols</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has announced that the driverâ€™s skills test, including the motorcycle skills test, will resume at all Driver License Centers.</p>
<p>Special guidelines have been put into place to minimize exposure for both the staff and the customers.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>As part of the new safety protocols, the staff member must stay outside of the vehicle during the entire test, while the test taker and an accompanying rider remain inside. The examiner will also use an iPad, rather than pen and paper, which will routinely be disinfected.</p>
<p>In counties that are in the yellow phase, applicants will receive a preliminary health screening. The test will not be given if the applicant exhibits any symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The screening will not be done at testing centers in counties in the green phase.</p>
<p>All customers and accompanying riders must wear a face mask during the testing, and examiners are also required to wear masks as well as gloves and eye protection.</p>
<p>Customers who had previously canceled a test due to the COVID-19 shutdown will be given priority when rescheduling by contacting the PennDOT Driver and Vehicle Services Call Center at 717-412-5300.</p>
<p>Beginning on June 20, all other customers will be able to schedule a skills test through the online appointment system.</p>
<p>Any exam that was scheduled on or after June 2 will proceed as scheduled.</p>
