<h1>City parking enforcement will resume at metered lots on Monday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Parking Authority will begin enforcement in neighborhood metered parking lots starting Monday, but those patronizing local businesses will be able to park for free for the first half hour.</p>
<p>Drivers must enter their license plate numbers at the meter kiosks to receive the&nbsp;free 30-minute window, which will be offered on a temporary basis and can only be used once per day, according to the authority.</p>
<p>Warning tickets will be issued for the first several days to alert drivers that enforcement has resumed.</p>
<p>No specific end date for the temporary 30-minute free parking was specified by the authority.</p>
