<h1>Allegheny County sets new single-day mark as COVID-19 cases surge above 100</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the first time since Allegheny County reported its first cases of COVID-19 on March 14, the single-day increase is over 100 new cases.</p>
<p>The county health department reported 109 new positive cases for Tuesday.</p>
<p>That brings the county total to 2,760 — 2,614 are confirmed and 146 are probable. There were no new deaths reported. While the new cases range between 10 and 83 years old, the median age is 26.</p>
<p>The state health department said Pennsylvania’s new total is 86,606. Of the 618 new cases reported across the state, 172 of them were in Western Pennsylvania. Beaver County had the region’s second-highest increase with 18 new cases.</p>
<p>No new deaths were reported in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Dr. Debra Bogen, the county’s health director, said on Sunday that more people were being tested for the disease, but that the higher number of infections reflected a surge in the virus in the community.</p>
<p>“In one three-day period, we tested 1,000 people, but we’re seeing a higher positive rate because there’s a lot more COVID disease in our community than there was a few weeks ago,” Dr. Bogen said.</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s online data shows the county had not had a positive test rate of 5% or more since May 24 — with positivity rates of just 1% or 2% most days. Then, starting on June 20 when the positivity rate hit 5% for the first time in a month, it has gone higher since then, hitting 10% on June 25, 9% on June 26, and 11% on June 27. The last time the county had an 11% positivity rate was in mid-April.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf complimented the county’s efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus by prohibiting the sale of alcohol for on-site consumption at a press conference on Monday.</p>
<p>The state health department said that despite the rise, there are currently no plans to move Allegheny County back into the yellow phase.</p>
<p>According to new data released by the county on Tuesday, there were an additional seven hospitalizations, making the total number 393.</p>
<p>Data released by the state on Tuesday reported an additional 35 COVID-19 related deaths, bringing the statewide death toll at 6,649. None of these new deaths occurred in Western Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
<p>State officials are reporting 183 deaths for Allegheny County, while data from the county is reporting 186.</p>
