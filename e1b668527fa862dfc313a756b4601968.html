<h1>Miss Manners: A nicer way to say 'back off'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>DEAR MISS MANNERS:</strong> When out in public, how can you politely ask people to keep their social distance?</p>
<p><strong>GENTLE READER:</strong> By treating it as a common problem, rather than showing offense at being encroached upon. Rather than "Back off," Miss Manners recommends, "I think we had better keep farther apart."</p>
<p><strong>DEAR MISS MANNERS:</strong> I am the mother of three children, and spend a great deal of time interacting on their behalf with other adults —teachers, administrators, doctors, receptionists, etc. — who invariably address me as "Mom." As in, "Mom can fill out this form," or, "What do you think, Mom?" (For context, even my children are not allowed to address me as "Mom" — in our house, it is "Mama" among the family, and "my mother" to everyone else.)</p>
<p>Possibly I'm betraying my age, but a professional addressing a grown person with a generic title seems lazy and disrespectful. I am a real person with a name and an honorific; I wouldn't address them as "Doc" or "Teach." I've often responded with, "You may call me Mrs. X.," but have to admit it sounds a little snotty. Do you have any better suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>GENTLE READER:</strong> The best response is still that used by Miss Manners' own dear mother decades ago: "If I were your mother, I'm sure that I would remember." Unspoken was the thought, "... and you would have been taught better manners."</p>
<p><strong>DEAR MISS MANNERS:</strong> My mom is terminally ill, but not contagious. I'm pregnant with her first grandchild. I've agreed to let my aunt and best friend throw an early baby shower so that my mom gets to celebrate the baby. There's a chance she won't be around when the baby is born, and I live far from my hometown.</p>
<p>I really don't care about the presents; I just want everybody to show up so my mom has a great party. We're inviting almost as many of her friends as mine.</p>
<p>If I were throwing it, I'd put a "Your presence is our present" type of message on the invitation. Since I'm not, I'm staying out of any planning.</p>
<p>Is there a polite way to communicate to some of my cousins, who are regularly flaky, that it's REALLY important to me that they show up for my mom without making it sound like I want their gifts?</p>
<p><strong>GENTLE READER:</strong> Of course. Who could deny your mother this pleasure? All Miss Manners asks is that you get rid of that word "shower."</p>
<p>Showers are, by definition, centered around presents. But because people do so little entertaining nowadays, they don't seem to understand that parties do not need names. Nor do you need to offer the sad explanation to your mother's friends and relatives, who must already know.</p>
<p>It is enough — and more flattering to your guests — to say that you will be in town visiting your mother, and both she and you are particularly eager to see everyone before you are grounded with the baby.</p>
<p>Besides, that way you will not require your aunt to break the rule against giving showers for one's relatives.</p>
