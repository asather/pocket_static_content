<p>WASHINGTON — Lawyers for President Donald Trump will return to the U.S. Senate on Monday to defend the president against abuse of power and obstruction charges in the third impeachment trial in American history.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s defense team is expected to continue its strategy of attacking the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats in September and claiming the president acting in accordance with established U.S. policy. On Saturday, the team proclaimed the president’s innocence in opening arguments lasting about two hours.</p>
<p>“They have the burden of proof, and they have not come close to meeting it,” White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told the senators on Saturday.</p>
<p>Here’s how events are unfolding today:</p>

<p><strong>Key senator: John Bolton bombshell report ‘strengthens the case’ for witnesses in Trump impeachment trial</strong></p>
<p>White House defense lawyers are arriving at the U.S. Capitol to continue arguments that President Donald Trump froze aid to Ukraine due to broad anti-corruption concerns in Ukraine.</p>
<p>A bombshell New York Times report on Sunday could upend that argument and shift the Senate to call witnesses in Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial.</p>
<p>The Times reported a book draft from John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, stated the president froze nearly $400 million in military aid to pressure Ukraine to dig up dig on a political rival.</p>
<p>Democrats have been calling for Mr. Bolton to testify since the impeachment inquiry in September, but Republicans rejected that move last week.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolton — who stepped down from the administration days before the surfacing of the whistleblower report that sparked the impeachment inquiry — has direct knowledge of the president’s motivations in Ukraine, Democrats have argued.</p>
<p>“This witness has such relevant information to share,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told reporters on Monday. “Senators should not wait until March 17 when the book comes out.”</p>
<p>The Senate will likely consider whether to call witnesses on Friday, after arguments and senators’ questioning wrap up.</p>
<p>One moderate Republican, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a statement on Monday that the disclosure “strengthens the case” for the Senate to call witnesses.</p>
<p>“I’ve always said that I was likely to call witnesses, just as I did in the 1999 Clinton trial,” Ms. Collins stated, but said she would make a final decision later.</p>
<p>Another key senator, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said it’s “increasingly likely” other Republican senators would join him in voting to call witnesses.</p>
<p>A total of four other Republican senators would have to join the 47 Senate Democrats in approving a measure, and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.,and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are also coming under pressure.</p>
<p>Michael Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee, tweeted at all four Republican senators that “it’s time to keep faith with the American people and call for witnesses.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., remain unswayed by Mr. Bolton's disclosure.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey “will make a determination regarding the need for additional witnesses – including Ambassador John Bolton — after the president’s lawyers make their presentation and senators have had a chance to pose questions,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Saturday he had so far heard no factual disputes in the trial that would, in his view, require the calling of witnesses.</p>
