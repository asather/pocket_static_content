<h1>City will collect trash on Good Friday; yard debris pickup canceled</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Trash collection will continue as usual this week in Pittsburgh, including on the Christian holiday of Good Friday.</p>
<p>However, the springtime yard debris collection scheduled for April 25 has been canceled&nbsp;“due to&nbsp;precautions for the crews during the COVID-19 pandemic,”&nbsp; the city announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>Any bagged yard debris and “bulky waste” items left out at the curb will be left behind by Environmental Services crews.</p>
<p>The city is reminding residents that regular trash&nbsp;must be bagged in tied-up, leak-proof bags and without tears.</p>
