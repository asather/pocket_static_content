<h1>Uniontown funeral director sent to prison in fraud case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former Uniontown funeral director was sentenced Tuesday to prison and ordered to pay more than a half-million dollars in restitution for ripping off more than 80 victims in a pre-paid burial fraud scheme.</p>
<p>Stephen E. Kezmarsky III, 52, of Uniontown will spend four to eight years in state prison followed by 20 years of probation, authorities announced.</p>
<p>He will have to pay $555,000 in restitution.</p>
<p>In 2018,&nbsp;Kezmarsky was charged with more than 170 felony and misdemeanor counts of theft and forgery after, prosecutors said, he stole $528,770 over 12 years from 82 elderly people who pre-paid for funerals.</p>
<p>Investigators believe he collected advance payments for funerals and instead of escrowing the funds as required by state law, he “comingled the funds with his business and personal accounts and stole his clients’ money,” according to the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office.</p>
<p>More charges were lodged against Kezmarsky last year&nbsp;after authorities found boxes of cremated remains in a storage unit.</p>
<p>Kezmarsky owned and operated Kezmarsky Funeral Home. Authorities said he committed his crimes from 2005 to 2017.</p>
<p>“For 12 years, Kezmarsky deceived dozens of Pennsylvanians who believed they were making final plans, and now he will spend a long time behind bars and repay what he stole,” Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in a statement.</p>
<p>Kezmarsky pleaded guilty in October.</p>
