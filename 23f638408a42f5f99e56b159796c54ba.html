<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto on Monday announced a new director of the Department of City Planning.</p>
<p>Andrew Dash, who has been acting director since June 2019, will take the position of director, pending approval from city council.</p>
<p>The department is responsible for neighborhood and parks planning, sustainability efforts, zoning and permitting, public art, and Americans with Disabilities Act support.</p>
<p>The mayor’s office credits Mr. Dash with developing the city’s neighborhood planning program and implementing the first phase of those plans, as well as creating the city’s <a href="https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/7843_Public_Engagement_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">Public Engagement Guide</a>, a guide on how to integrate the public input into decision-making. Additionally, Mr. Dash led efforts to continue the permit and zoning review process and establish virtual Board and Commission meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the mayor’s office.</p>
<p>“I’m honored to lead this Department and the talented staff that we have as we plan for a sustainable and equitable future at such an important moment in Pittsburgh’s history. I look forward to continuing to learn from Pittsburghers to help create a resilient city where development benefits the city and our neighborhoods and equitably works for all residents,” Mr. Dash said in a press release.</p>
<p>Mr. Dash has been with the City Planning since 2008 when he began as a senior planner. He was named assistant director in 2014. Mr. Dash started his career as a city planner in Akron. He has a bachelor’s degree in geography and planning from the University of Akron. Mr. Dash lives in Manchester.</p>
<p>Mr. Dash is not the only former assistant-turned-acting director to be named head of a city department this month.</p>
<p>Sarah Kinter, former assistant director to Maura Kennedy at the Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections, was named director of that department on June 15.</p>
<p>Ms. Kennedy <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/11/20/Permits-licenses-inspections-Maura-Kennedy-director-Amazon-economic-development/stories/201911200129" target="_blank">departed in November for a job with Amazon in Washington, D.C.</a>&nbsp;Ms. Kinter then took on the role of acting director.</p>
<p>Prior to that, Ms. Kinter served as assistant director since October 2017. She came to the department from the city’s&nbsp; Commission on Human Relations where she was the deputy director since June 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Kinter, of Stanton Heights, holds a master’s degree in public administration from the University of Pittsburgh and a bachelor’s in political science and international studies from Wilkes University.</p>
<p>City council is set to vote on Ms. Kinter’s appointment Tuesday.</p>
