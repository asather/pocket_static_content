<p>BRADENTON, Fla.&nbsp;— At least for now, it will be business as usual for the Pirates in Bradenton for spring training.</p>
<p>The team said in a statement Monday that there are no plans to alter operations despite two people in Florida <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/01/coronavirus-Florida-cases-Pirates-spring-training-Manatee-County-Bradenton/stories/202003010232" target="_blank">testing positive for COVID-19</a>, the new coronavirus, as announced by&nbsp;Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday. One of the patients <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/01/coronavirus-Florida-cases-Pirates-spring-training-Manatee-County-Bradenton/stories/202003010232" target="_blank">lives in Manatee County</a>, where the Pirates make their spring training home.</p>
<p>“The safety of our fans, players, and staff is paramount,” the statement said. “We continue to monitor the situation very closely and are working with our expert partners at AHN and Highmark, as well as with MLB, to ensure we are up to date on any developments and are actively considering the appropriate precautions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It is too early in the fact-finding process regarding the reported case in Manatee County to comment on any potential impacts on our operations. We encourage everyone to listen to and rely upon the advice and guidance of the public health experts.”</p>
<p>There have been 88 cases of coronavirus that have been identified in the U.S., according to the New York Times. Minor cases of the virus, also known as COVID-19, can cause flu-like symptoms. Over 3,000 people globally have died from severe cases.</p>
<p>The Pirates played against the Blue Jays in Dunedin on Monday and are off on Tuesday. They’ll return to action on Wednesday for split-squad games with half of the team staying in Bradenton for a game against the Braves. The other half is going to Clearwater, Fla., for a contest against the Phillies.</p>
