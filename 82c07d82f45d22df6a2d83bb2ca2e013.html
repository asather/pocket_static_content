<h1>Literacy Pittsburgh's 'What is your vision for 2020' campaign seeks volunteers </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Literacy Pittsburgh is making a push for volunteers with its “What is your vision for 2020” recruitment campaign, which runs through the month of January.</p>
<p>Founded in 1982, Literacy Pittsburgh offers tutoring services to adults throughout the Pittsburgh area in Allegheny and Beaver counties with both volunteers and paid classroom teachers.</p>
<p>Last year, nearly 500 tutors logged more than 27,000 volunteer hours within Literacy Pittsburgh’s two core programs — college and career readiness and English language learning. In 2019, 594 students were tutored in the English language learning program and another 368 in its college and career readiness program.</p>
<p>Despite all those volunteer hours, there is a great need for more tutors now and throughout the year.</p>
<p>“People often want to make a positive change in their own lives and give back to their community as a new year begins,” said Maria Polinsky, director of marketing and communications for Literacy Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“Becoming an adult literacy tutor is a great way to change another person’s life while enriching your own,” she said.</p>
<p>“There are currently about 200 students waiting for a volunteer tutor.” Ms. Polinsky said.</p>
<p>All tutors complete training with Literacy Pittsburgh prior to being matched with a student.</p>
<p>Once paired with a student, tutors, with the help of Literacy Pittsburgh, design a plan built around a student’s individual goals.</p>
<p>“There really isn’t a typical student,” Ms. Polinsky said. “Some may have very low-level reading skills, some may need to catch up on knowledge they missed out on in high school, and some may simply need a brush-up to be successful at job training or college.”</p>
<p>“Some students are preparing for job training or college. Some need to do their current job better or qualify for a promotion. Others may need to take the high school equivalency diploma tests,” Ms. Polinsky added.</p>
<p>The English language learner component of Literacy Pittsburgh has students from more than 100 countries including China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bhutan, Syria, Uzbekistan, Mexico and Venezuela.</p>
<p>“Like our college and career readiness program, these students represent a wide variety of skill levels,” Ms. Polinsky said. “Some know virtually no English, while others may have learned English in their home countries but struggle to converse with native speakers.”</p>
<p>Tutors who choose to help English language learners do not have to speak a second language as all tutoring is conducted in English.</p>
<p>“Students are grouped by current English proficiency level, not by native language, so there is much diversity in our classes,” Ms. Polinsky said.</p>
<p>Marian Matik, of Elizabeth Township, has been volunteering with Literacy Pittsburgh for nearly two years, and during that time has tutored two individuals.</p>
<p>“I love to read and thought I could help someone enjoy reading and help with their reading skills,” Ms. Matik said.</p>
<p>As a tutor with Literacy Pittsburgh’s college and career readiness program, Ms. Matik was trained to help students with many subjects including reading, math and history.</p>
<p>Ms. Matik said she started volunteering after she retired because, “I think it’s just the overall idea of being able to help someone make their life a little bit easier.”</p>
<p>Ms. Matik is tutoring Maura Babinger, 24, of McKeesport, who is striving for her GED diploma.</p>
<p>“I tried once before” to pass the GED test, Ms. Babinger said. She said she sought tutoring to make sure the next time she takes the test, she passes it.</p>
<p>Ms. Babinger said she dropped out of high school in 2009 when she was 14 years old because of medical issues. She’s been meeting with Ms. Matik for a little over a year.</p>
<p>As for why she looked to Literacy Pittsburgh for tutoring, Ms. Babinger said, “I think everyone needs to push forward no matter what they do.”</p>
<p>“I just want to get a better job,” Ms. Babinger said, adding she works in the food service industry but has aspirations of being a professional photographer.</p>
<p>Both college and career readiness and English language learner tutors are needed now and throughout the year. Tutors must be 18 years of age or older and will complete nine hours of free training prior to being matched with a student. Additionally, tutors must either have or be working toward a four-year college degree.</p>
<p>Literacy Pittsburgh asks that tutors meet with their student for a minimum of six months to build rapport and create continuity. They must also be able to meet with their student twice a week in a public location for two hours each time.</p>
