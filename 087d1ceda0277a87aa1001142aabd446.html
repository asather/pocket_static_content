<h1>This week marks the end of the extra $600 with unemployment claims</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Barring an extension, this week marks the last time people filing for unemployment compensation will receive an additional $600 with their benefits.</p>
<p>The Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program, part of the federal government’s larger legislative package to provide economic relief amid the COVID-19 pandemic, began providing eligible individuals with an additional $600 to supplement their state unemployment benefits in April and is set to last through the week ending July 25.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, that means practically all 3.3 million people filing unemployment claims will no longer receive additional assistance.</p>
<p>“We know it's going to be difficult,” Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry Jerry Oleksiak said Monday at a virtual press briefing.</p>
<p>Mr. Oleksiak said the department is urging Congress to extend those benefits and encouraged residents to reach out to their legislators to voice their support for the program.</p>
<p>“We think they are a very important means of support for people in very difficult times,” he said.</p>
<p>That support has not been universal. Practically since the program began, some legislators, economists and employers questioned whether the additional payments would discourage people from returning to the workforce because they could potentially make more money on unemployment than their original salary.</p>
<p>Others said the $600 was always meant to encourage people to stay home in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The additional payments have served as a lifeline for both workers and the national economy, some argue.</p>
<p>As of Monday, Congress had not moved to extend the FPUC program, but legislators had offered some possible ways forward, including extending the program through January or adjusting the supplemental payment to between $200 and $400.</p>
<p>“We know there is a lot of talk in Washington about doing it,” Mr. Oleksiak said. “Whether it gets done, when it gets done, whether it’s $600, whether it’s some variation of that, we have no idea. ... That’s a decision that is out of our hands.”</p>
<p>If Congress does act to extend or adjust the program, the state’s Department of Labor and Industry said it is prepared to continue processing those payments for eligible individuals.</p>
<p>Any changes that come about, whether in the amount of money granted or in determining who is eligible, could make the process trickier, said Director of the Office of Unemployment Compensation Benefits Policy Susan Dickinson.</p>
<p>“It’s just a matter of having enough time to program it and test it and then put it in production,” Ms. Dickinson said. “The sooner that the federal government takes action, the better.”</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, the Department of Labor and Industry has distributed about $13.5 billion through the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program -— that’s nearly half of the $28 billion in benefits paid out by the state since March 15, when Gov. Tom Wolf began issuing orders to close businesses and in-person operations.</p>
<p>That number could grow as people are paid retroactively for claims that are still being processed. Eligible individuals can still receive the additional $600 for weeks from April 4 through July 25, even if the payment is made at a later date, Ms. Dickinson said.</p>
<p>As of now, the state has processed about 92% of the claims it has received from March 15 through mid-June. The other 8% of claims, which amounts to about 90,000 people, are ones that need to be reviewed manually, the state says.</p>
