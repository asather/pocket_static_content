<h1>Catching up with Twins prospect and Plum High alum Alex Kirilloff</h1>

<p>FORT MYERS, Fla — Saturday is the type of day that Alex Kirilloff dreamed about while playing at Plum High School. Like many people in Western Pennsylvania, he watched the Pirates build themselves into a playoff contender from 2013-15 and lived and died with every pitch.</p>
<p>Kirilloff, 22, is the Minnesota Twins’ top prospect, according to CBS Sports, and the outfielder has a solid chance to make Twins’ roster at some point this season.&nbsp;On Saturday, Kirilloff gets the chance to play against the team he loved as a child in a spring training game.</p>
<p>“I grew up rooting for them, and any time you get to play your hometown team, I think it’s pretty special,” Kirilloff told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “I grew up watching baseball, grew up rooting for Andrew McCutchen, Jason Bay, all those guys.”</p>
<p>Kirilloff also wants to add to the number of Western Pa. natives playing in the majors. He grew up following the exploits of Neil Walker. The slugger hopes that one day a young kid will be able to follow him the same way.</p>
<p>“It was just cool to see how Neil connected with the city. It was pretty cool him growing up in Pine-Richland,” Kirilloff said. I kept track while he was in the minors, and then coming up in the big leagues with the Pirates, That was cool to see. And obviously, some continued success with some other organizations too.”</p>
<p>Kirilloff had a special delivery to wait for before he could start playing games this spring. He and his wife, Jordan, had their first child, Penelope, on Feb. 20. Now Kirilloff has more motivation than ever to make Twins’ big league club.</p>
<p>“I think it adds a good bit,” Kirilloff said. “I got a family to feed now, so this week’s been pretty special, having our little girl and everything. So hopefully, we can arrange and manage traveling and everything like that during the season too. I’m sure we’ll figure it out.”</p>
<p>It didn’t take Kirilloff long to catch up. He went 1-for-2 and drove in a run with a single in his first game Wednesday. The first home run was a two-run bomb that came Friday against the Boston Red Sox. Kirilloff also belted a single in the win for the Twins.</p>
<p>“He’s a pretty gifted young hitter. This is a guy that’s always had good at-bats, can find the barrel on different pitches in the zone,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “He can do some pretty nifty things the way he attacks the ball. He would have what you probably call the opposite of a grooved swing.”</p>
<p>Kirilloff has a bit of an unorthodox swing. He tends to stride away from the plate, which most hitting instructors would frown upon because it could be harder to hit outside pitches. But it works for Kirilloff, and the deep home run was an example.</p>
<p>“He can do different things, and find different angles, and find the barrel. So, he hit that one really well,” Baldelli said. “We were just talking about him a little bit in the dugout right as he was taking the swing, and we saw it. Got a chance to see it live. Really nice.”</p>
<p>Kirilloff had two stints on the injured list in 2019 with Class AA Pensacola.&nbsp;He suffered a sprain to his right wrist and missed the first month of the season. Kirilloff reaggravated the injury in June and missed 19 games.</p>
<p>When he was healthy, he put up numbers. He posted a .283 average with nine home runs and 43 RBIs in 375 at-bats. In 2018 he had 20 home runs and a .348 batting average between Cedar Rapids and Fort Myers.</p>
<p>He’s healthy and locked now. The 15th pick in the 2016 draft also overcame a Tommy John surgery that derailed his 2017 season. He believes those setbacks are part of his testimony.</p>
<p>“From a young age, I felt that God’s will for my life was to play baseball for a long time, hopefully,” Kirilloff said. “And for me, it’s ... just working as hard as I can and just seeing what happens. I know God has a plan for my life, and if it’s to continue to play with the Twins, that’d be great. But for me, it’s just about taking it one step at a time and working hard.”</p>
