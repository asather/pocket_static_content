<h1>Penguins offering refund options for season-ticket holders</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With six home games left on the Penguins’ 2019-20 schedule and no word from the NHL on if, when or where those games will be played, the team is offering ticket holders a choice.</p>
<p>In an email sent to season-ticket holders Friday, the Penguins said fans can either have the money for those games rolled over and applied toward next season or have it refunded.&nbsp;The email reminded fans that the deposit deadline was pushed back, while also addressing the uncertainty of next season.</p>
<p>“Given the fact that we may be delayed in starting next season and the current challenges we are all facing, we will be completely flexible with payment options,” the email read.</p>
<p>The Penguins previously outlined their policy for single-game ticket buyers and group ticket buyers o<a href="https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/201920-nhl-season-update-frequently-asked-questions/c-316157974?_cldee=bXJvc3NpQHdtdHIuY29t&amp;recipientid=account-b98befc71d78e51180c80050568153f8-aa9246cb4baf41cb90713ca754b7bbe8&amp;esid=61d117ab-3791-ea11-8170-0050568153f8" target="_blank">n the FAQ section of the website</a>. It’s essentially the same as the policy for season-ticket holders.</p>
<p>Group ticket buyers should contact their Penguins representative to apply credit toward a future game or request a refund. Fans who purchased single-game tickets through the Penguins’ ticketing department can apply money from their purchase toward a future game or request a refund by emailing cservice@pittsburghpenguins.com.</p>
<p>Single game tickets purchased directly from Ticketmaster or on the secondary market will be subject to their respective postponement policies.</p>
