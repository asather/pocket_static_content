<p>Flash back to 1969.</p>
<p>The Rolling Stones announce their U.S. tour and Rolling Stone magazine bristles at the price, noting that the $5.50 to $8.50 for tickets far exceeds what The Doors are charging at $3.50 to $6.50.</p>
<p>“I really don’t know whether this is more expensive than recent tours by local bands,” Mick Jagger says in a press conference. “I don’t know how much people can afford. I’ve no idea. Is that a lot? You’ll have to tell me.”</p>
<p>Putting it through the handy U.S. Inflation Calculator, that $5.50 to $8.50 in 1969 would adjust to $38 to $58 in 2020.</p>
<p>When the presale began Wednesday for The Rolling Stones at Heinz Field, we finally learned the ticket price and it was a bit more than that, especially on the high end. Tickets are $61 to $675, plus $45 in fees.</p>
<p>Fans logged on with a presale code to find themselves in waiting queues generally with 2,000-plus other fans — and, surely,&nbsp;ticket brokers. It was taking about a 30 minutes for some people in those 2,000-plus queues to get through it.</p>
<p>The June 23 date, part of the No Filter Tour, will be the legendary British band’s first Pittsburgh show in five years.&nbsp;Tickets go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday at rollingstones.com.</p>
<p>The No Filter Tour, which began in May 2017, has played to 1,506,259 million fans and grossed $237.8 million.</p>
