<h1>Belle Vernon earns first title-game berth since 1978 with win over New Castle</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Belle Vernon had more than one opportunity to fold its tent and concede a trip to the WPIAL Class 4A title game to three-time reigning champion New Castle.</p>
<p>But surrender wasn’t an option for the Leopards and, because of their determination, they will make their Petersen Events Center debut on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Sophomore guard Devin Whitlock scored 13 of his 17 points in the first half to help stake Belle Vernon (19-6) to an early lead, then hit a couple of key free throws down the stretch as the Leopards earned their first berth in a title game since capturing the Class 3A title in 1978 with a 56-46 victory over New Castle (17-8) at North Allegheny.</p>
<p>“We knew we had to stay composed,” Whitlock said. “We knew they was going to come out strong and take shots at us, so we just called a time out, calmed ourselves down and took it one play at a time.”</p>
<p>Belle Vernon played without senior guard Cam Nusser, who was declared ineligible for the game. He will also not participate in the WPIAL championship game.</p>
<p>“I knew [Wednesday] but he hurt his ankle, so we planned on him maybe not playing anyway,” Belle Vernon coach Joe Salvino said. “There was a decision made, but the people that were in there were going to play the game.”</p>
<p>Even without Nusser, Belle Vernon played solid defense throughout as the team held a New Castle team that lives and dies by the outside jumper to 18 of 65 (27.7%) shooting from the field on the night, including a dismal 2 of 15 performance in the second quarter that allowed the Leopards to turn a 16-14 deficit after the first quarter into a 28-21 lead at the intermission.</p>
<p>Poor shooting on the part of the Red Hurricanes also allowed Belle Vernon to win the battle on the boards with a 40-39 edge.</p>
<p>“Honestly, we just played how we do, hands up and out,” Belle Vernon senior forward Mitchell Pohlot said. “And, plus, with shooting, you’ve got to believe you’re going to make the shot because, if you don’t believe, it’s not going in.”</p>
<p>Belle Vernon was helped out immensely by the fact New Castle junior sharpshooter Sheldon Cox spent most of the first half on the bench in foul trouble. Cox, who made a school-record nine 3-pointers on the same floor in the first round, was held to two points in the first half and finished with 10 on the night.</p>
<p>Without him and Michael Wells — who also spent some time on the pine in first-half foul trouble yet still finished with a game-high 20 — New Castle never really got into an offensive rhythm.</p>
<p>“We did a lot right throughout the course of the game defensively and I think we took a few from a little too deep and I think they moved us out a little bit,” New Castle coach Ralph Blundo said. “At the end of the day, Belle Vernon played well, they’re a gritty group, and the ball just didn’t go in enough.”</p>
<p>Despite a poor shooting effort, though, New Castle was still able to take a 46-45 lead on an old-fashioned 3-point play from Isiah Boice — who finished with 14 — with 3:22 left in regulation. But those were the last points the Red Hurricanes scored, as Belle Vernon closed it out on an 11-0 run.</p>
<p><strong>Other semifinal</strong></p>
<p>Highlands forward Johnny Crise back-rimmed a slam attempt in the first quarter.</p>
<p>“That dunk, I think I tried doing a little too much and I was trying to get everyone fired up and fire up the bench, but it doesn’t work if it doesn’t go in,” Crise said. “I just had to dial it back a little bit.”</p>
<p>After that, the senior forward didn’t miss much else.</p>
<p>Crise finished with a game-high 27 and completed the double-double with 10 boards as top-seeded Highlands (20-3) earned its first finals appearance since 2016 with a 53-46 win over Blackhawk.</p>
<p>Several times in the first half, the game appeared to slip away from Highlands as Blackhawk opened the second quarter on a 7-2 run to take a 20-11 lead with 5:56 left in the half. But the Rams chipped away and took the lead on the first of back-to-back thunderous alley-oop dunks from Crise before the Cougars’ Marco Borello hit a 3-pointer with 37.8 seconds remaining to give them a 29-28 lead at the intermission.</p>
<p>Highlands, though, used a 12-1 run early in the third quarter — keyed by six points from Crise — to take a 42-33 lead and closed it out.</p>
