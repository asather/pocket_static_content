<h1>Peduto calls for investigation, Police Review Board 'swamped' with complaints after East Liberty protest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto wants a&nbsp;“full, third party” investigation into what occurred Monday night between police and protesters in East Liberty, where violent clashes broke out after an hours-long&nbsp;peaceful demonstration.</p>
<p>Thousands, who were on hand to protest police brutality and the death of&nbsp;George Floyd at the hands of Minnesota police a week earlier,&nbsp;sat and marched in the streets. The event, which began in the afternoon at Penn and Centre avenues, lasted through the evening, when organizers asked participants to leave before a curfew was enforced.</p>
<p>Tension began when a small group remained behind and police fired tear gas and less lethal rounds to disperse what police had declared an unlawful assembly.</p>
<p>“For the past 36 hours, I have studied best practices of less lethal crowd dispersion, I have read countless comments on social media and viewed first-hand video, photographs and accounts. The public safety director provided me with the written official transcripts of all Command operations during that day and I have talked with every person in the command rank who was on the ground or in the command center,” Mr. Peduto said in a press release Wednesday. “Without question, there is a difference of opinion about what happened that day and the appropriateness of the actions of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.”</p>
<p>The mayor’s office&nbsp;“wants to release the transcripts,” but is waiting for the city’s Law Department to determine whether it is permitted under state law, said Timothy McNulty, mayoral spokesman.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto has directed the Office of Municipal Investigations and the Citizen Police Review Board to conduct the investigations.</p>
<p>In a letter to the review board, Mr. Peduto said he is “hoping” the body can work with the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Pittsburgh branch and the United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania “to perform a review of city actions.”</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto’s statement followed the Citizen Police Review Board’s Tuesday night announcement that it had opened an investigation into police response to all protests in the city since Saturday, but with a particularly focus on the events that unfolded in East Liberty.</p>
<p>Beth Pittinger, the board’s executive director, said the watchdog group has been&nbsp;“swamped” with calls after police broke up a group of protesters on Centre Avenue following a peaceful march. Police claim that the group began throwing rocks at officers; those present say police struck first with tear gas and crowd-clearing projectiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“About eight this morning, our intake director told me the phone hasn’t stopped ringing since five o’clock last night,” Ms. Pittinger said Wednesday.&nbsp;“The general theme [of complaints] is that the police story is inaccurate and that the group there was peaceful, they weren’t engaging in anything that was disruptive. ...&nbsp;There’s a lot of anger and there’s a lot of rage about the deployment of force that the police used Monday night.”</p>
<p>Ms. Pittinger said she did not know the exact number of complaints.</p>
<p>The organization’s seven-member board called for an investigation of all the protests, beginning with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/01/Pittsburgh-police-mayor-bill-peduto-protests-violence-riots-anarchists-antifa-arrests/stories/202006010114" target="_blank">Saturday’s violent demonstrations</a>, to&nbsp;“assess whether the behavior that has been witness up until whether the police were within policy,” Ms. Pittinger said.</p>
<p>“I think that was true, up until Monday night. Monday night presented a whole different scenario, and we’ve heard a lot from community that was present, the community reacting to what they saw on video and social media posting,” she said.&nbsp;“And we’ve heard the alternative from police that they were being assaulted with rocks and a water bottle and various debris.”</p>
<p>The review board is comprised of three mayoral appointments and four city council appointments.</p>
<p>The march that began in front of the Target at 2:30 p.m. traveled through East Liberty until 7 p.m. when organizers asked the group to go home. The city was still enforcing an 8:30 p.m. curfew on Monday.</p>
<p>Several hundred protesters remained and flooded the intersection and sidewalks. Some walked towards a Dollar Bank on Penn and threw rocks at the windows. Organizers of the march immediately <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/01/Protesters-police-clash-East-Liberty-Pittsburgh-tear-gas-riots/stories/202006010115" target="_blank">ran towards the group and told them to stop</a>.</p>
<p>As the group continued to march, their path was blocked by a line of SWAT officers at Centre and South&nbsp; Negley avenues.</p>
<p>After a brief standoff, the officers informed the group about the unlawful assembly and ordered it several times to disperse. Police then fired tear gas, bean bags and “sponge rounds,” according to public safety officials on Tuesday when they <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/02/East-Liberty-protest-Pittsburgh-police-confirm-tear-gas-used/stories/202006020142" target="_blank">confirmed that tear gas had been used</a>.</p>
<p>In all, 20 were arrested, nine officers were injured and released from the hospital, and two protesters were taken for medical care after receiving injuries from the bean bags, according to public safety officials.</p>
<p>In a late Monday night press conference, Mr. Peduto, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, police Chief Scott Schubert and command staff <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/06/02/East-Liberty-Pittsburgh-protest-violence-Mayor-Bill-Peduto/stories/202006020060" target="_blank">said a small&nbsp;“splinter group” of protesters caused the violence</a> and first threw bricks, rocks and water bottles at police prior to canisters and projectiles being fired on protesters.</p>
<p>The mayor has&nbsp;“long discussed” best practices for mass demonstrations with public safety,&nbsp;“most prominently during the protests over the death of Antwon Rose, and then again during the protests that began Saturday,”&nbsp; Mr. McNulty said.</p>
<p>Public Safety officials did not respond for comment, including on whether Pittsburgh law enforcement was joined by other agencies Monday night.</p>
