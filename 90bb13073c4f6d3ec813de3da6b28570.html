<h1>Pirates' Jarrod Dyson discusses his decision to kneel during national anthem</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Before the Pirates’ opening day matchup against the St. Louis Cardinals, during the national anthem, centerfielder Jarrod Dyson took a knee.</p>
<p>The action is a form of silent protest against social injustices in the U.S., which were further pushed into the spotlight after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd on May 25.</p>
<p>While Dyson was the only player who kneeled during the anthem, he wasn’t alone. Manager Derek Shelton left the front of the Pirates’ line to stand behind Dyson, showing his support for his player.</p>
<p>“It meant a lot to me,” Dyson said after the game, which ended in a 5-4 Pirates loss. “We're searching for change in this world and equal opportunities and justice. It just meant a lot. I'm behind my community 110%, and we're just searching for change in this world. It was good getting everybody behind me and encouraging me to do what I did. I feel great about it.”</p>
<p>Added Shelton: “I was aware he was going to take it. When we had talked about it, he said he was going to do it. I wanted to show support for him, so I went over and stood next to him.”</p>
<p>Athletes across baseball and multiple other sports have taken a knee, whether it be during the national anthem or prior to games to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, and Dyson followed suit.</p>
<p>Across Major League Baseball, in fact, teams have held a black ribbon between them while lining up during and before the national anthem, signifying their support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Several Cardinals players knelt while the ribbon was laid out between the teams.</p>
<p>Dyson said the response and discussion amid he and his teammates was encouraging, and implied that the bond between teammates went beyond what players chose to do or not to do during the national anthem.</p>
<p>“It's all personal,” Dyson said. “It's all about how you feel and what you want to do. At the same time, we're a family in here, and we're going to have each other's back. So no matter what decisions you make, if you wanted to stand, if you wanted to kneel, we're all for everything. We're going to have each other's back. Nobody's going to be looking at each other side-eyed because of it. We're a family in here.”</p>
<p>When asked, Dyson didn’t say specifically that he would kneel for the anthem tomorrow against the Cardinals, joking that he&nbsp;“might not show up next time.” He did say that he does like to keep things consistent.</p>
<p>Dyson did balk a bit at the amount of attention he received after the game for his pregame gesture. Seemingly, his stance is that the symbolic gesture shouldn’t be focused on so intensely when nearly everybody, at this point, understands the reason behind it.</p>
<p>“Man, I thought we were going to talk about the ballgame for three hours, not kneeling, man,” Dyson said. “I don't know why y'all are bringing so much attention, kneeling, because everybody knows what's going on in this world. Everybody knows how we feel about everything that's going on in this world. So to be sitting there talking about the knee, it's like searching, you know what I'm saying? So I'd rather talk about baseball, because that's what I play. It ain't for the kneel down or nothing like that. I don't want to make that the main priority here, because that main priority is to win ball games when we suit up.”</p>
<p>That holds true for the way Dyson says the conversations with his teammates have gone surrounding social injustice issues. Basically, the focus for the Pirates’ payers is on the game itself.</p>
<p>And Dyson did focus on that. When he was done kneeling during the anthem, he stood up and played nine innings of baseball. He used his platform to make a statement supporting a cause he believes in and then did his best to help his team win the game.</p>
<p>“Everything that's happening in the world, we don't have too much control over it,” Dyson said. “We can voice our opinion and use our platforms as well, but other than that, man, when I come to the ballpark, I'm thinking about winning. That's it. That's the main goal. It ain't about the national anthem and all that, because we've got a ballgame to play. The national anthem plays for, what, two minutes or something like that? We've got a three-hour ballgame. So my main focus is to win ballgames. It's not to worry about the outside when I'm on the field.”</p>
