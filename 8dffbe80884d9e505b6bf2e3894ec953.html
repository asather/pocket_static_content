<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County) A few resident walleye were taken in waters ranging from about 45 to 50 degrees. Smallmouth bass were caught while making spawning runs up the larger tributaries. Big Bass Program regulations requiring no harvest catch-and-immediate-release remain in effect through June 12, and deliberately fishing for bass on nests is prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Justus Lake</strong> (Venango County) Despite a cold front that drove fish to deeper water, anglers reported good fishing for trout and largemouth bass from the southern boat launch to the dam. No crappie action was reported.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Venango County) Smallmouths and some walleye were taken on crankbaits.</p>
<p><strong>French Creek</strong> (Venango County) Crankbaits, spinners and jigs with soft plastic tails attracted Northern pike and smallmouth bass.</p>

<p><strong>Pine Creek</strong> (Allegheny County) Good-sized trout continued to be caught in the Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only area.</p>
