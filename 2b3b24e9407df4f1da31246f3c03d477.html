<h1>Justin Champagnie's career day keeps Pitt's season alive against Wake Forest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>GREENSBORO, N.C. — In the days before his team’s ACC tournament opener against Wake Forest, Jeff Capel approached Justin Champagnie, his standout freshman forward, with a bit of bad news: He hadn’t made the league’s all-freshman team.</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to be mad,” Champagnie recalled Capel telling him before delivering the blow.</p>
<p>It stung. Champagnie had finished the season as the Panthers’ leading scorer and rebounder, and even as his team faltered late in the season by losing its final seven regular-season games, he had played well and kept some of those setbacks from being even more odious.</p>
<p>The snub had an effect. The 6-6 Brooklyn native is preternaturally calm, with a laid-back cadence off the court and a soft touch on it, but inside him, a sort of rage boiled.</p>
<p>“I kind of felt disrespected when I found out I didn't make it,” Champagnie said. “But at the same time, I used it as motivation and I just came out here and showed why I should have been on the team."</p>
<p>He did just that. With his team in a position in which it had to win to keep its season going, Champagnie was as good as he has been in a season in which he had already been quite good, pouring in a career-high 31 points on 13-of-19 shooting to pace Pitt in an 81-72 victory Tuesday against Wake Forest at Greensboro Coliseum.</p>
<p>The win was Pitt’s first since a Feb. 8 triumph against Georgia Tech, a game in which Champagnie, interestingly enough, recorded his previous career high of 30 points. Tuesday’s outburst marked the fifth time in program history a freshman had scored 30 points or more in a game, with all of those performances coming from players on the current roster — Champagnie (twice), Trey McGowens (twice) and Xavier Johnson.</p>
<p>“That’s what I’ve been doing my whole life,” Champagnie said. “I’ve always been counted out.’”</p>
<p>His production wasn’t just impressive, but timely and impactful.</p>
<p>Champagnie scored 14 of his first 16 points in the final 9:38 of the first half, helping the Panthers go from being down eight to down one going into the break. His 3-point shooting, a point of wild inconsistency in an otherwise strong season, was accurate when it needed to be, as he made three of his seven attempts. On a day in which the Panthers (16-16) scored 42 points in the paint — compared to 28 from the Demon Deacons (13-18) — Champagnie stood as the biggest reason why, making all six of his layups with an array of crafty finishes, namely a reverse layup he has used to great effect this season as a way to shield himself from longer defenders on the low post.</p>
<p>Even on the rare occasion things seemingly didn’t go well, like when a dunk attempt hit off the rim coming out of his hands, they ultimately did, as the ball flew several feet above the basket before eventually falling back in.</p>
<p>“I thought he was the one that really hit the wall the hardest,” Capel said of Champagnie. “This is different for a freshman, when you get to this level and the pressure and these games coming at you.”</p>
<p>Champagnie piloted Pitt to one of its most impressive offensive outings of the season, even if it came against a Wake Forest team that ranks 165th in Division I in defensive efficiency. In a dramatic departure from what they have been for much of the past month, the Panthers, the tournament’s No. 13 seed, were crisp and efficient offensively, making 52.3% of their shots and averaging 1.25 points per possession. In six of their previous seven games, all losses, they had shot below 39% from the field. The 81 points were their most in an ACC game this season.</p>
<p>Four other Pitt players joined Champagnie in double figures — McGowens with 14 points, and Johnson, Au’Diese Toney and Abdoul Karim Coulibaly, each of whom had 10. Coulibaly matched a career high in scoring and set a career high with seven rebounds. In what has been an up-and-down sophomore season for Johnson, who made that vaunted all-freshman team last season, he had eight assists to three turnovers.</p>
<p>Though they struggled defensively for much of the first half, often being late in their rotations, the Panthers were stout when they most needed to be. They held Wake Forest to 35.5% shooting in the second half, including missing its final eight shots, and goaded it into 11 second-half turnovers.</p>
<p>“It's no need to worry about tomorrow or what's upcoming, because we have to earn the right to get there,” Capel said. “And what we were able to do today was earn the right to play tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Having done that, Pitt advances to the second round, where it will play Wednesday at 2 p.m. against an N.C. State team it lost to, 77-73, 10 days earlier on the road. It’s a quick turnaround common at this time of year, one that will require the Panthers to play fewer than 20 hours after the win against Wake Forest ended.</p>
<p>Heading into Tuesday, Pitt was in a drastically different position, one that helped explain, even more than Champagnie, why it was able to get a victory after going agonizingly long without one.</p>
<p>After their 16-point loss on March 4 against Georgia Tech, the Panthers didn’t play a game for the next five days. In that time, a team that was visibly gassed got some sorely needed rest. They weren’t just physically tired, but mentally tired. It had gotten so bad that Johnson said he was tired of even seeing basketballs.</p>
<p>“It was just good to get away because I’m pretty sure dudes were tired of seeing each other every day and tired of losing,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>Having seen that fatigue and the detrimental effect it had for weeks, Capel gave his players Thursday and Friday last week off. Even once they recongregated on Saturday, they only did individual workouts and lifted. That lull was, in their coach’s mind, necessary.</p>
<p>“What I told them was just get completely away from basketball,” Capel said. “We have been mired in this losing streak and there's a lot of stuff written, a lot of stuff said, and these young people read this stuff. As much as you don't want them to, they do, and it affects them.”</p>
<p>For weeks, Capel had said his team was worn out, pointing out that Pitt’s bad luck with the ACC’s schedule, which didn’t provide it with a designated bye until the final weekend of the regular season, hadn’t helped matters.</p>
<p>He was chided by some for making excuses, but if Tuesday’s win showed anything, it was that it wasn’t an excuse — it was an explanation and, given the way his team played, an accurate one, at that. A team that had looked listless in many of those seven losses was engaged and energized in a way it hadn’t been in some time.</p>
<p>The victory against the Demon Deacons may just be delaying the inevitable. It’s quite possible, maybe even likely, the Panthers’ season will be over fewer than 24 hours after it was temporarily extended. If nothing else, though, they gave themselves not only a much-needed positive feeling, but a chance to keep playing and keep fighting. At this point in the college basketball calendar, that’s all for which many teams can ask.</p>
<p>“We always were talking about before the game started just to leave it out on the line, like whatever you got and be the better team,” Champagnie said. “We don't want to go home. Nobody wants to go home, so we're just going to keep fighting and keep pushing.”</p>
