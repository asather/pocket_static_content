<h1>Review: Pittsburgh Opera brings back baroque ornamentation in strong 'Alcina'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What makes a singer stand out these days? No matter the genre, there should be an ability to convey sincere emotion, then there’s range and dynamic power. Several hundred years ago, an additional aspect brought the masses to the opera house: ornamentation.</p>
<p>Baroque period arias, or operatic solos, often repeated phrases and entire sections for the singers and orchestra. Here the singer could show off their creativity and skill by embellishing with scales and trills and arpeggios and other musical adornments. It was expected that a composer leave space for singers to strut their stuff — some sources say that singers would be offended if a composer tried to exclude ornamentation. Similarly, singers and musicians alike in the baroque period knew they were expected to emphasize certain beats and figures. There was an extensive set of&nbsp;“performance practices” that guided musical interpretation.</p>
<p>This is the framework Pittsburgh Opera takes for its latest production, Handel’s&nbsp;“Alcina,” which opened Saturday in the intimate Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts theater in Downtown. The tale follows a fiancee’s attempt to win her enchanted betrothed back from the fickle sorceress Alcina. Cross-dressing shenanigans and mistaken identities abound.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s early music ensemble, Chatham Baroque, bolstered the Pittsburgh Opera orchestra to provide support and a more historically informed approach to the score. This collaborative ensemble of about 25 players, led by music director Antony Walker, sounded well-matched, luxuriant in some of the slower arias and swooping and stirring in some of the more rousing tunes. A small note — the dry acoustics of CAPA made some ends of phrases sound abrupt; more taper on resting notes might ease this issue.</p>
<p>The opera programs a baroque opera every two or three years for its resident artists, a group of young opera singers developing their voices and skills after college but before launching full-time careers. Pittsburgh Opera’s resident artist program has incubated numerous singers who have taken the stage at some of the world’s most renowned theaters. On Saturday, soprano Natasha Wilson proved a show-stealer as Alcina’s sister, Morgana, her charismatic whimsy and light, supple voice proving an absolute delight. Angel Romero as Oronte (Morgana’s lover) also began with an enthusiastic momentum coupled with a smooth, lyrical tenor; however, later in the opera this momentum carried him away&nbsp;— he occasionally rushed ahead of the orchestra.</p>
<p>Antonia Botti-Lodovico was obnoxiously petulant in the pants role (a woman playing a man) of the enchanted Ruggerio, convincingly portraying his arc of redemption back to a more heroic bearing and proving a highlight in the second act aria “Verdi prati.”&nbsp;There was an unfortunate lack of chemistry between Ruggerio and his rescuer, Bradamante, the latter sang by resident artist alumna Laurel Semerdjian, whose voice seemed overly heavy during some of the quick coloratura of her part. In slower sections, though, her voice demonstrated ample firepower. Alcina herself, soprano Caitlin Gotimer, was enchanting as she moved from all-powerful witch to jilted lover, achieving a pitiable sense of wretchedness in her later arias with a fraught, excitable tone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The production proved strong, a charming introduction to another style of opera singing. The set by Sarah Delaney Boyle appeared a touch cramped at the outset but brought Alcina’s island to life with terrible grandeur. Costuming by Jason Bray was well-planned and played a visual role in the characters’ individual progressions, as did the richly varied lighting by Nate Wheatley. As for the singers and their ornamentation, Ms. Wilson and Mr. Romero seemed to take to this naturally, and the others succeeded to varying degrees. This isn’t baroque opera as it would have been heard in the 1800s, but for an evening on the town in Pittsburgh, it’s a charming window to another style of opera and a fine evening’s entertainment.</p>
