<h1>'America's Got Talent' returns with Judge Cuts show: Will Kennedy's Ashley Marina learn her fate?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“America’s Got Talent” promotions reveal little about tonight’s Judge Cuts show, except that everyone’s chances are remote.</p>
<p>As in, no one performed live in front of the judges panel. That included Ashley Marina, 12, a Kennedy Township singer/songwriter. There’s no guarantee her performance will be part of the broadcast but the show has promised it will reveal the names of those who advance in the competition.</p>
<p>Ashley, a student at Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School in Midland, Beaver County, was featured auditioning in June. She made a good impression after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2020/06/16/Americas-Got-Talent-Ashley-Marina-advances-Season-15-auditions-2nd-chance-Simon/stories/202006160125" target="_blank">getting a second chance</a>, singing a work of her own composition,&nbsp;“You’ll Always Be My Hero.”</p>
<p>“AGT” goes to live shows in August, when viewers have the chance to vote for their favorites. The recently taped show that airs tonight shows judges Simon Cowell, Sofia Vergara, Heidi Klum and Howie Mandel sitting in front of a giant screen.</p>
<p>It begins at 8 p.m. on NBC.</p>
