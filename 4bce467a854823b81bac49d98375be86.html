<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Health inspectors shut down Vickey’s Soul Grill Desserts at Monroeville Mall for operating without a health permit and other food safety violations.</p>
<p>Besides no permit, the facility lacked a three-bowl sink to clean and sanitize utensils as well as sufficient ventilation and required commercial-grade cooking and refrigeration equipment, according to an inspection report by the Allegheny County Health Department.</p>
<p>The operator of Vickey’s couldn’t be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Inspection reports for food facilities in the county are&nbsp;<a href="http://webapps.achd.net/Restaurant/" target="_blank">available here</a>.</p>
