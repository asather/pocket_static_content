<h1>COVID-19 Update: Allegheny County reports 8 new deaths as total cases exceed 10,000</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department on Wednesday reported 14 new COVID-19 cases — exceeding the 10,000 mark —&nbsp;and eight new deaths.</p>
<p>With the latest reported infections, the county total now stands at 10,004 cases since the pandemic began in mid-March.</p>
<p>The 14 cases come from 1,151 tests administered between Aug. 21 and Aug. 25. Those who have tested positive range in age from 6 to 98, with a median age of 49.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania saw an increase of 501 new cases for Wednesday, with Western Pennsylvania accounting for 97 of those newest cases.</p>
<p>Westmoreland County had the highest daily increase in the region with 15 new cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Statewide, there have now been 130,536 cases of the virus since mid-March.</p>
<p>The state health department on Wednesday also reported 19 new deaths, 11 of them in Western Pennsylvania. In addition to Allegheny County’s eight deaths, Butler, Indiana and Lawrence counties each reported one death.</p>
<p>The state death toll is now 7,624.</p>
<p>Allegheny’s deaths — four of which are connected to long-term care facilities — occurred between July 17 and Aug. 18, according to health officials.</p>
<p>The deaths were of two people in their 60s, four in their 70s, and one each in their 80s and 90s. The county has had 317 COVID-19 related deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Based on data from the state, there are currently 84 people in Allegheny County hospitalized for the virus. A total of 938 people in Allegheny County have been hospitalized because of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed testing guidelines on Monday. The new recommendation now says that if a person has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive, they “do not necessarily need a test” unless recommended by a healthcare provider, or if the person is a vulnerable individual.</p>
<p>This is a change from the former recommendations that gave priority testing to people who were considered in close contact to someone who tested positive.</p>

<p>• Allegheny: 10,004 (up 14 from Tuesday)</p>
