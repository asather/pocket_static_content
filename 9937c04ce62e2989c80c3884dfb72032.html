<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The first novel coronavirus case was reported in New York on Sunday, according to state Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p>The patient is a woman in her late 30s, who contracted the virus while traveling abroad in Iran. She is currently isolated in her home, Cuomo said.</p>
<p>"The patient has respiratory symptoms, but is not in serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving to New York," Cuomo's statement read.</p>

<p>The New York State Department of Health said the patient went to a hospital in Manhattan after contracting the virus.</p>
<p>Cuomo said approval for state testing was granted on Saturday and the positive test was confirmed by New York's Wadsworth Lab in Albany.</p>
<p>"There is no cause for surprise -- this was expected," Cuomo said. "As I said from the beginning, it was a matter of when, not if there would be a positive case of novel coronavirus in New York."</p>
<p>Cuomo added there's no reason for "undue anxiety."</p>
<p>"The general risk remains low in New York. We are diligently managing this situation and will continue to provide information as it becomes available," he said.</p>
<p>Disease detectives in New York have already identified close contacts of the patient, according to New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot.</p>
<p>"As we confront this emerging outbreak, we need to separate facts from fear, and guard against stigma and panic," Barbot said.</p>
