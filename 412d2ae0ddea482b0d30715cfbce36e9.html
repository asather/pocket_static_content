<h1>Paul Zeise: Chris Archer needs to deliver in a big way in 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Chris Archer has always said and done the right things and has become one of the Pirates’ most visible players. He seems to be well liked and respected by his teammates and is clearly one of the team’s spokesmen.</p>
<p>I understand why people like the always thoughtful and insightful Archer. But it’s too bad his on-field performances have not come close to matching what he does off the field, in the community and in the clubhouse.</p>
<p>That’s why his hair cut,&nbsp;the new excitement and new start with a new manager, his new pitching programs and philosophies and all the other stuff that we’ve read about so far mean little to me.</p>
<p>I get it, his mind is right as spring gets underway, but many fans want to see less talking about pitching philosophies and programs and more striking out hitters out and winning games.</p>
<p>Is that harsh? Maybe, but it is time for Archer to deliver on the enormous potential we are continually told he has. It’s time for him to become that top of the rotation pitcher the Pirates were hoping they got when they traded a boatload of young talent to bring him here.</p>
<p>He was brought here to be the Pirates’ best pitcher, the veteran who sets the tone for a young staff and the player who helped put the club over the top and back into wild-card contention.</p>
<p>The Pirates gave up three premier prospects — Tyler Glasnow, Austin Meadows and Shane Baz — to get Archer, and he hasn’t come close to proving he was worth that. He is, instead, quickly becoming the answer to the question, “What is the worst trade of the Neal Huntington era?”</p>
<p>Yes, nowadays wins don’t mean everything, but Archer has started 33 games for the Pirates and has six wins.&nbsp;I don’t need a degree from the Ivy League or be immersed in books about Big Data Baseball to understand that a man who starts 33 games and only has six wins has not come close to getting the job done.</p>
<p>Archer hasn’t gotten deep into games consistently, and he doesn’t pitch effectively enough when he is actually in the games.</p>
<p>His 119⅔&nbsp;innings in 23 starts last season means his average start was 5⅓&nbsp;innings. His ERA was 5.19, his WHIP was 1.41 and his FIP was 5.02. Those numbers are bad in case you are old school and don’t understand analytics. He did average 10.8 strikeouts per nine innings, but who cares when you’re usually gone before the sixth inning is done.</p>
<p>It’s great to hear that Archer is happy and in a good place, but the Pirates need him to give them so much more if they are going to have any chance to finish anywhere other than last place.</p>
