<h1>U.S. judge grants emergency restraining order, blocks removal of Guatemalan minor</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A federal judge in Pittsburgh early Sunday morning temporarily blocked federal authorities from removing a Guatemalan teenager from Holy Family Institute in Emsworth, where he has been living after entering the U.S. across the Mexican border in 2018.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak granted an emergency request by lawyers for Agustin Choc Acte, 17, for a restraining order against the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement.</p>
<p>Holy Family received a call on Saturday that agents were coming at 3 a.m. on Sunday to take Agustin to Brownsville, Texas, for removal based on an order from an immigration judge in Houston, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
<p>The ACLU filed an emergency motion early Sunday to block the action and the judge signed it after a phone hearing with Agustinâ€™s lawyers and the U.S. attorney's office, barring anyone in the government from removing Agustin until his case can be heard. The judge issued the order shortly before 2 a.m. from his home to stop the ORR agents.</p>
<p>"Based on the information relayed at the telephonic hearing before the court, [Acte] has had no opportunity to receive notice or participate in the removal proceedings against him," the judge ruled.</p>
<p>He said Agustin has no family or friends to look out for him beyond his lawyers at Jewish Family and Community Services, a non-profit that provides legal help for children at Holy Family.</p>
<p>He said there's no harm in "slowing down" the process to give Agustin a chance to present his case for staying in the U.S.</p>
<p>"Allowing for a methodical and meaningful determination of [his] ability to remain in the United States would be in the best interest of all," he said.</p>
<p>Agustin and his father were detained by the Department of Homeland Security in December 2018 when they crossed the Mexican border. His father was released into Houston and sent his son to live in Indianapolis with a cousin. The father stayed in Houston but then returned to Guatemala, taking with him all of the immigration papers regarding his son's status.</p>
<p>Agustin worked construction jobs to support himself. In January, according to the judge, police questioned him, determined he was an unaccompanied alien child and turned him over to ORR, which placed him at Holy Family in February.</p>
<p>Lawyers at JFCS determined he was eligible for relief from removal and filed a motion for dependency in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court, which was granted April 21. The lawyers then checked on his immigration status and found out a Houston judge had ordered him removed in July 2019.</p>
<p>But no one told him or the lawyers, according to the ACLU.</p>
<p>So the JFCS on April 23 filed a motion to reopen the immigration case. They got no response. Instead, the next they heard, Holy Family was on the phone Saturday saying agents were coming. Only then did the lawyers learn that the Houston judge had denied the petition to reopen.</p>
<p>Vic Walczak, legal director of the Pennsylvania ACLU, said he's never encountered a similar situation. The main point of confusion that no one has been able to explain is why immigration authorities felt they had to show up at 3 a.m. to pick up a 17-year-old who is essentially in the custody of a "bunch of nuns" and poses no threat to anyone.</p>
<p>"That was a question all of us had," he said. "We have no answer."</p>
<p>Although law enforcement typically stages raids in the wee hours because they fear someone might run or put up a fight, there is no indication that Agustin would do either.</p>
<p>Judge Hornak said there's nothing in the record to indicate he's broken any laws.</p>
<p>Mr. Walczak said it would have been a simple matter just to delay any action in the case until Monday or sometime this week instead of forcing everyone into emergency action "in the middle of the night" on a Sunday.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office would not comment.</p>
<p>The next step is for the JFCS lawyers to mount a challenge of the removal decision. As of Monday they still had not received a copy of the immigration's judge's order. Under the Fifth Amendment, non-citizens have a right to a hearing before being removed from the country.</p>
<p>Judge Hornak said Agustin has a right to due process and said the restraining order will remain in effect until May 22.</p>
