<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: How much will the Steelers’ offense need to change? </h1>

<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lucius Allen and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>not a pirate, @RevD98:</strong> Will Ben buy into a different offense game plan?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Ben is going to <em>make</em> the plan, to a large degree, Mr. not a pirate. Get that part straight.</p>
<p>This is his offense. It’s his offensive coordinator. And if he proves he can still sling it, be sure you will see him working often out of the shotgun with “eligibles” all over the place, throwing more than he hands off.</p>
<p>Will he also be able to scale it back and run more when necessary? Will the coaches make sure of that?</p>
<p>Great questions.</p>
<p>I’m glad I asked.</p>
<p>First, if the Steelers could recreate their 2018 offense, that would be wonderful. That unit finished fourth in total yards and sixth in scoring and led the league in red-zone touchdown percentage at a whopping 73.5%. Give them a few more field goals (Boswell missed a lot) and a few less turnovers (Ben picks, Conner key fumbles, JuJu in New Orleans and Grimble at the goal line), and it would have been even better.</p>
<p>I’m guessing that if their best player (Mr. Big Chest) hadn’t quit in the final week of the season, they would have destroyed the Cincinnati Bengals JV team instead of turning in a terrible performance that hurt their overall numbers.</p>
<p>But that offense also was heavily predicated on the pass, “heavily” being an understatement. It attempted 689 passes compared to 345 runs.</p>
<p>That can’t happen again. That won’t happen again. The Antonio Brown factor alone — he’s gone, in case you haven’t noticed — makes it so.</p>
<p>The Steelers will need to run the ball more often than they did that year. I’d love to see Ben get back to a little more play-action. He has done some of his best work there.</p>
<p>Also, JuJu was great two years ago, and Vance McDonald was very good. Will they bounce back?</p>
<p>Is the offensive line as good as it was two years ago?</p>
<p>Will the Steelers supplement their offense in the draft?</p>
<p>Will James Conner be healthy? Is Benny Snell Jr. a capable front man if necessary?</p>
<p>And the biggest question of all: Will Ben’s arm and body be ready to go?</p>
<p>I have no problem with a pass-based offense, but the Steelers will need to be more balanced. They will need to keep the defense off the field and cut down on the turnovers from 2018, by any means necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Gary Morgan, @garymo2007:</strong> Hi Joe,When you think of a sweet swing in baseball, do you find most are left-handed? Griffey, Bonds ... If so, why do you think that is?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> First, I think that’s a fascinating question, Dr. Morgan. Seems to me, without any real proof, that lefties have a better and more artistic shooting stroke in basketball, too. At least that’s my experience (I’m a righty), and as another reader, Jonathan Cassella (@JCBuccos) pointed out, lefty golf swings always look prettier, too.</p>
<p>Jonathan believes that’s partly because the lefty golf swing is so rare. It therefore looks different and more appealing.</p>
<p>As to your question regarding lefty hitters, the Washington Post did a wonderful story on this some 20 years ago. Bottom line: There is no science behind it, just a lot of guessing. Then-Baltimore Oriole Terry Crowley suggested that because lefties face mostly right-handed pitchers growing up, “They can get real comfortable up there. Real aggressive. And you can take a nice, natural swing. They hardly ever have to worry about getting one in the ear” from a lefty.</p>
<p>As such, they develop a more artistic swing.</p>
<p>Sound crazy? <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/baseball/longterm/1999/playoffs/worldseries/articles/lefties27.htm" target="_blank">Here’s the story</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Mike, @coachpsu316:</strong> Did you have a favorite sports moment from when you played as a kid growing up?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Just like the pros, I remember the bad moments more than the good ones, Mike.</p>
<p>But this one always stands out, and always will, on the positive side:</p>
<p>We were playing at Garnett Field, Little League, I was maybe 10. I played for the Orioles. I’ll never forget the sound of the aluminum bat hitting the ball. I cracked a line drive down the left-field line. I looked up, and it cleared the fence! My first (of two) career home runs. And to make it even better, my dad was standing right where the ball landed (he always stood far from the other parents). I saw him clapping as I rounded the bases.</p>
<p>Yup, that’s a keeper. And I kept the ball, which had a beautiful bruise where I connected.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t panic, wash your hands, be kind, @agpohlman:</strong> Do you think Bob Huggins deserves to be in the Hall right now?</p>
<p>Starkey: Without a doubt. His 809 wins are eighth all-time, just ahead of Eddie Sutton — who just got elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame without a national championship (Huggins has not won one, either).</p>
<p>Plenty of guys with fewer wins and no titles are in. Huggins belongs. Rick Pitino tweeted as much the other day. Others should get on board.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Maguire, @quan_ambassador:</strong> Patriots tanking next season so they can get Trevor Lawrence?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> The thought has crossed my mind — not necessarily for Lawrence but a tank season in general In the end, however, I don’t think Bill Belichick has the stomach for that. By the way, are you THE Jerry Maguire?</p>
<p>Listen, the Patriots have sustained heavy losses this offseason, starting with that Brady guy at quarterback and extending to multiple outstanding players on defense. I just don’t believe Belichick, who is about to turn 68, has time on his side here, or the desire to sink to the bottom of the league for a year — even if that might be what’s best for the franchise.</p>
<p>I’m sure he believes that he can coach his way to division title — it’s not like there’s a juggernaut in the AFC East — or at least to that extra wild-card spot. I’m not sure I’d bet against him, either.</p>
<p><strong>leyon2992, @Leyon2992:</strong> Who is the best Pitt team since 2000. I know a lot of [people] say ’09. I actually think ’08 pre-Cook injury was better. And I think ’04 was there best team period.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> If you’re talking 2003-04, I would agree, Mr. @Leyon2992. That team went 28-5 before running into Dwyane Wade and losing by a mere three points. That team had every ingredient needed, from inside power, to outside shooting (if Zavackas was right) to depth (Krauser, Troutman) to a lockdown defender (Julius Page) to great leadership (Brandin Knight) and coaching (Ben Howland). They blew out Wagner and Indiana in the first two rounds of the tournament and even had then ex-Indiana coach Bob Knight predicting they would win the national championship.</p>
<p>That was Pitt’s best team.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Egan, @Robdogg039:</strong> Admit Tim Duncan is a top-10 player all-time.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I’m glad you asked (sort of), Dr. Egan.</p>
<p>The Top 10 basketball players of all-time:</p>
<p>1. Magic Johnson: all-time assist-per-game leader, also had a year where he averaged 9.6 rebounds per game, which the next two guys on this list never did. Best all-around player of all-time.</p>
<p>2. Michael Jordan</p>
<p>3. LeBron James</p>
<p>4. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</p>
<p>5. Bill Russell</p>
<p>6. Wilt Chamberlain</p>
<p>7. Larry Bird</p>
<p>8. Kobe Bryant</p>
<p>9. Oscar Robertson</p>
<p>10. Tim Duncan</p>
<p>Happy now?</p>
<p>I’m not — because I left out Shaq, Jerry West, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Kevin Durant and others. But it’s not like this is easy.</p>
<p>You try it.</p>
<p><strong>Spike G. Willoughby, @whompinwillough:</strong> HEY</p>
<p>STARKENATOR! Long Time, First Time. Would you rather Pitt football get its own stadium in Oakland, but never win more than five games in a season or stay in Heinz Field forever with the chance the program improves w/ Narduuzzi? #GodBless</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Good morning Spike. I’d rather win, or have a chance to win, than be consigned to never winning more than five games in a season.</p>
<p>What kind of question is that?</p>
