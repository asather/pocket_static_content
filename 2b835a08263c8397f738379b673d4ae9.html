<p>Dozens of people hoping to pick up pre-paid food orders&nbsp;from some Pittsburgh-area restaurants on Mother’s Day spent hours in line, and many were eventually sent home without their food.</p>
<p>Several took to social media complaining of not being able to receive their food orders from the Olive Garden in Cranberry and elsewhere and Red Lobster in Ross, where patrons were frustrated to be turned away on the special day. Others complained of traffic woes and long wait times at Pasta Too in Bethel Park, Applebee’s on Lebanon Church Road in West Mifflin, and Texas Roadhouse in Monaca.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parking lot of the Red Lobster along McKnight Road was packed with nearly 100 people who sat in their cars and waited outside, according to Post-Gazette news partner KDKA-TV. Many people — including food delivery drivers —&nbsp;left without the food they paid for.</p>
<p>After hours of waiting, local police arrived and a store manager eventually came outside and informed the crowd they wouldn’t be fulfilling anymore orders, KDKA reported.</p>
<p>Many customers who left frustrated said they blamed the company for taking&nbsp;“way more orders than they could possibly fill,” KDKA reported.</p>
<p>In a corporate statement, the Red Lobster chain apologized for the long wait times and crowds, and that many chose not to wait for orders. But unfulfilled pre-paid orders will be refunded, the company said. Customers who ordered food through a third-party should request their money back through the company where the order was placed.</p>
<p>“During these unprecedented times, we are grateful for our guests who continue to want to celebrate with Red Lobster,” Red Lobster said in the statement.&nbsp;“It’s always our goal to provide our guests with a great seafood experience, while also maintaining high standards for health and safety, including social distancing.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional restaurant officials could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>According to KDKA, some drivers who waited in the parking lot were food delivery drivers trying to keep in contact with their customers.</p>
<p>“I talked to them and said it’s going to take a long time,” Khalid Alzahlani told KDKA.</p>
<p>Others were waiting for online orders.</p>
<p>“We’ve been waiting for two hours and 20 minutes and they said there’s no way you can cancel it,” Ron McAdams told KDKA. “You can’t cancel it online…”</p>
<p>Not all restaurants were experiencing delays in meeting demand on Sunday.</p>
<p>One woman wrote on Facebook that the Olive Garden she went to “was busy but very organized. Whoever came up with numbering the parking spaces deserves a raise.”</p>
<p>And still others showed support for the restaurants that were slammed with the Mother’s Day rush:</p>
<p>“All restaurant employees feel defeated after yesterday. We didn’t want to ‘ruin’ anyone’s day. We tried so hard to feed other people while our families were home without us,” Erin Rogers said on Facebook.</p>
