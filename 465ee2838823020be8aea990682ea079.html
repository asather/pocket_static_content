<h1>Penn State's veteran linemen have no regrets about passing on NFL</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Regret is a scary feeling at any time. Remorse for deciding to forgo the NFL draft and stay in college could escalate while much of the world is working through a pandemic.</p>
<p>Penn State offensive linemen Will Fries and Michal Menet both had opportunities to leave early for the NFL this offseason. Even if they didn’t get drafted, they could’ve signed free-agent deals. Instead, they’re each anticipating one more season protecting Nittany Lions quarterback Sean Clifford.</p>
<p>Fries and Menet were the first players to address a group of assembled media since COVID-19 closed the campus over two months ago.</p>
<p>And neither player has expressed any contrition about choosing to return to school.</p>
<p>“I’m definitely not second-guessing it,” Menet told reporters Wednesday via Zoom. “I put a lot of time into my decision. It really was kind of an easy decision for me.”</p>
<p>Menet, a team captain who made 13 starts at center last season, cited a desire to improve as the fuel behind his choice.</p>
<p>“There are definitely things I know I needed to work on to become a better player,” said Menet, who was an All-Big Ten honorable mention selection in 2019. “I’ve been really addressing those since the season ended, so it’s been a positive for me.”</p>
<p>Fries, too, remains undeterred about his choice.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing I can do about it,” Fries said of the upcoming football season potentially being in peril. “It’s out of my control. I can’t worry about it. All I can do is get myself better every day. All I can do is keep preparing for whatever the next opportunity is. At some point, with the guidance of health and safety officials, people will be able to get back. I’m looking forward to when that is.”</p>
<p>Fries, a right tackle, has made 33 starts for the Nittany Lions. As one of the more experienced players, he’s taking on a leadership role within the program and relishes the chance to impart encouragement to others.</p>
<p>“I’ve been checking in on a couple of guys every day,” Fries said. “Seeing how they’re doing, seeing how their family’s doing. These are crazy times, so the most important thing is just to make sure everyone’s mentally straight. I think our group has done a great job. Even the younger guys are calling me and holding me accountable.”</p>
<p>If there is a football season and if the Nittany Lions are going to be successful, they’ll need Menet and Fries to be sharp. The offense also has adjustments to make with new offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca and new offensive line coach Phil Trautwein. Both Fries and Menet said they are consistently interacting with the new arrivals.</p>
<p>“Me and Coach Traut talk pretty regularly on the phone. I’m asking him questions, all that kind of stuff,” Menet said. “We also have these Zoom meetings which have been extremely valuable for us, especially transitioning into a new offense and a new O-line coach. It’s been really vital for us.”</p>
<p>Physically, however, they’re working on their own to stay ready for whenever football returns.</p>
<p>“It’s really not that bad because most of what you do, besides obviously walking through it and being able to run it live, is studying the film and watching clips from past offenses doing it and that type of stuff,” Menet said. “So it’s really not that bad as long you’re taking good notes and being able to go back through them and watch them.</p>
<p>“Obviously, you’re missing a component of being able to walk through a line with a defense, but some of the things I’ve been doing, I’ve just been kind of visualizing plays a lot.”</p>
<p>Menet is also envisioning a life with actual football again, as many of us are.</p>
<p>“We’ve discussed all the possibilities, but I’m really trying not to think about it much,” Menet said. “My opinion really doesn’t matter. People who do this stuff for a living are going to be the ones to tell us when it’s the safest for everybody to get back.”</p>
