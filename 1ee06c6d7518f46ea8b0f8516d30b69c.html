<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Beechview man was arrested Thursday on charges that he threw an improvised explosive device at police during a protest against police brutality.</p>
<p>Police allege 25-year-old Nicholas Lucia&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/07/Police-seek-man-suspected-throwing-exploding-incendiary-device-officer-mellon-square/stories/202006070099" target="_blank">threw the device</a> at officers near Mellon Square, Downtown, during a May 30 protest responding to the killing of George Floyd in police custody. The device exploded on the ground and gave an officer “concussion-like” symptoms, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Lucia was seen on security cameras entering a Lyft vehicle less than an hour later. Authorities obtained a warrant and used it to access Mr. Lucia’s data from Lyft, where they found his drop-off location, first name and phone number.</p>
<p>Police obtained an image of the device from body camera footage and described it as a “canister-type device with packing around the top and a long wick,” the complaint reads, but the apparatus was not recovered because of the explosion.</p>
<p>Mr. Lucia was arrested Thursday, but court records do not show if he was arraigned. He faces&nbsp;over two dozen charges including attempted homicide, possessing weapons of mass destruction, riot, two charges of aggravated arson and 12 charges of aggravated assault.</p>
