<h1>Social bonds are knotted at fly tying meetings</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Amid all the bobbins, bodkins and hair stackers, it’s easy to wonder whether it’s worth sharing in the vice of chronic fly tying.</p>
<p>Ron Milavec, 76, of Upper St. Clair said that like casting the flies, tying them is easier than it might seem. And although some veteran tiers get extremely good at it, it doesn’t take a lifetime to master. Mr. Milavec, who leads a fly tying group that met Wednesday in Upper St. Clair, didn’t start until he was in his mid-50s.</p>
<p>“I was a noodle rod [spin fishing] steelheader for a long time before I caught some using a friend’s fly rod. I got into tying because when you’re going to lose a half dozen or more flies a day and you’re paying a buck, buck and a half for each one at the fly shops, it adds up,” he said.</p>
<p>“If your dad was into fly tying, you probably got into it when you were young. But if not it’s something you might easily pick up later in life.”</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, January to March are the cabin fever months when many fly anglers are at the vise stocking up for the year’s fishing seasons. But fly tying doesn’t have to be a solitary affair. Throughout the region, fly shops and organizations schedule tying courses, classes, seminars and demos for beginners and advanced fly tiers.</p>
<p>An angling social butterfly of sorts, Mr. Milavic is active in Penn’s Woods West Trout Unlimited, its informal offshoot Bar Flies and the Upper St. Clair Fly Fishing Club, which he’s been managing since 2006. He also teaches fishing skills to novices at Venture Outdoors’ TriAnglers program and has helped to coach beginners during the Post-Gazette’s fishing bus trips.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, he taught tying techniques at the Upper St. Clair Municipal Building, focusing a camera on his vise while projecting the magnified image on the wall behind him. A half dozen men attended the meeting, which was free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Using vises, tools and materials provided by the club, they learned two entry-level nymphs: a Peeking Caddis, suggesting a caddis larva emerging from its stone or stick case, and a Mop fly with a body made from coarse, colored mop string.</p>
<p>Nick Forte of Venetia, a fly tier for five years, said that although fly tying videos can be downloaded from YouTube, he attends the monthly Upper St. Clair meetings because of Mr. Milavec’s patient mentorship and contact with the other students.</p>
<p>“You can’t get that on a computer,” he said. “It's good to come here to socialize. You talk with the other guys, maybe set up a fishing trip.”</p>
<p>In the next room, Dale Kotowski, a popular regional fly fishing and tying instructor, demoed the Killer Bug, suggesting a cranefly larva, and a Burlap Stonefly nymph during a private meeting of Project Healing Waters. The nationwide group incorporates fly fishing, fly tying and related activities in the physical and emotional rehabilitation of disabled military veterans.</p>
<p>Thomas Moore, 77, of West Alexander served in Vietnam in 1965-66. He said the Healing Waters experiences have helped him to get back into fly fishing while he continues to process his Army experiences.</p>
<p>“It’s helped me a lot. Other guys, too,” he said. “You focus your thinking on fly tying [and] it’s therapy for physical things, even depression. We don’t talk about our experiences, just fishing. There’s camaraderie at the meetings. We have each others’ backs.”</p>
