<p><strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Hello, hockey fans. We're going to try to talk Penguins today knowing that the NHL could announce this afternoon that the season could be suspended so the league can figure out how to proceed in regards to the coronavirus pandemic. I don't know much about what will happen next, but I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about that, or the usual ones about Jack Johnson and Matt Murray. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: As of right now, the Penguins are following the NHL's lead. They are operating as if they will play tonight's game in Columbus with no fans in the arena but are bracing for the other shoe to drop. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: So please send over a question if you have any and we'll get started here in a few minutes. Hope you're all OK and staying safe. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: OK. I'm ready to get started. Again, if you've got a question, fire away.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: I know we're talking about a 3rd pairing defenseman but why does Sully seem to dislike Juuso Riikola so much? How does he compare against Johnson analytically? He has to be better right? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: It's good to know we are still maintaining a sense of normalcy in this chat! Yes, Juuso's "advanced statistics" are much better than Jack's, obviously in a smaller sample size. Those actually paint a picture of Riikola having a positive impact. But what they don't show is the one or two major mental lapses that Riikola seems to have every game, and I'm guessing that's why the coaching staff hasn't trust him, fair or not. Plus, the Pens value Jack as a penalty-killer. Look at the work he did in New Jersey, especially during that 5-on-3. So it's hard to imagine the Pens taking Jack out of the lineup for Riikola.</p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: I get the NCAA. They make so much money from the TV rights for the basketball. The only ones on the court getting paid are the coaches and the refs. They need to hold the games and can afford to refund the ticket money and still do ok. But hockey, I suspect they need to have fans in the seats to be profitable. What are your thoughts on the economics of it, and please comment on the NBA and MLB if you can. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I'm not an expert on sports business, but I'd guess all sports need fans in the seats to be profitable. But yeah, I'd say that's especially so with the NHL. That said, we've reached a point where we have to stop worrying about making bucks and do what is best for our citizens, whether they care about sports or not, and the players, coaches, officials, etc. If the NHL does announce today that it is suspending its season, that's not the same as cancelling. The hope is that our country gets a handle on this pandemic, the league figures out a way to resume where everyone is safe and then they pick up where they left off or have a shortened regular season or postseason. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Say, hypothetically, the league is ready to resume six weeks from now. Just throwing a random number out there. Would they just call off the rest of the regular season and use the current standings to determine the playoff field? Would they do best-of-five series to make up for lost time? Is there any chance they would shrink the playoff field, maybe having eight teams get instead of 16? Like I said, these are all secondary concerns at this point. But this are the kinds of scenarios the league is probably already kicking around.</p>
<p><strong>pozone</strong>: Do you think the Pens need some size and grit or is it just me? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I have no problem with them leaning into their identity. They're betting they can win with speed, peskiness and obviously some elite offensive talent. That's how they won those back-to-back Cups. I think they tried a little too hard after those Cups to add some of the size and grit that you are coveting and they led to a roster, at least last season, that lacked some cohesion. Anyway, it's kind of late for them to do much about it now. The trade deadline has passed. They do have big but unproven players such as Anthony Angello in their system, though Angello is currently out with an injury.</p>
<p><strong>Skinny Dug</strong>: I hope they keep playing, but Yahoo apparently has a plan in place for cancelled games.<br> <br> Where do you think Conor Sheary ultimately will fit in? In his last stint, he seemed to have done fine as a top 6 guy but not so much as a bottom 6er. But if he's playing with guys like McCann, Hornquist, etc on a third line, those seem like guys he could do better with. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Not sure what you're referring to in your initial statement. Sorry. In response to your question, it sure looks like he'll be given every opportunity to play with Sidney Crosby. He's been on his right wing ever since they acquired him, perhaps just for the lack of a better option. I do think Sheary, with his speed and puck pursuit, could have some impact on any of their top three lines. It just comes down to Mike Sullivan and the Penguins finding the right fits. Right now, with Dominik Simon on the shelf, it seems like it's either Sheary or Patric Hornqvist as candidates to skate with Crosby and Jason Zucker.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Has Conor Sheary shown better defensive instincts than his last stint here? I seem to recall much puck watching and getting lost in his own end during his last stay. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Matt, I was not covering the team then so it's hard for me to say, though I was keeping tabs on them from afar. I will say that he hasn't wowed me with his defensive work in his current stint. He does have some tools. That will be important for him to remain on that line. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: One thought that my partner, Mike DeFabo, brought up in a conversation yesterday: If the season does get suspended and the playoff resume in, say, May, that might buy Jake Guentzel enough time to return from shoulder surgery. Again, there are much more important things in the world to worry about right now, but that could potentially be a silver lining for the Pens. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: In case you're wondering, Mike Sullivan said at some point in the past few days that Jake Guentzel remains on schedule in his rehab. The team announced in late December that he'd be out 4-6 months.</p>
<p><strong>Skinny Dug</strong>: Sorry I was saying Yahoo had a plan in place for fantasy hockey leagues...but I typed that in the wrong window, wasn't meant for you. Sorry about the confusion <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Ah! That makes sense. Yeah, hard to have a fantasy hockey league if there are no real-life games being played. Which reminds me, I also have a fantasy team. Haven't set my lineup in a few weeks. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Any more questions? If not, I'm going to get some more coffee in my system in anticipation of news from the league coming shortly...</p>
<p><strong>Skinny Dug</strong>: When is the NHL going to have their announcement? Keep hearing rumors from "credible sources" but nothing from actual sources <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Reports are the NHL will have something to say before 2 p.m. The Penguins, still here in Columbus, remain in a holding pattern. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: OK, looks like this is all we got for today's Penguins chat, which, given what is going on in the sports world and the world in general, is understandable. Stay tuned for news in the coming hours. I would be surprised if that news isn't that the NHL is going on a hiatus, too. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Stay safe and keep others in mind during these unsettling times.</p>
