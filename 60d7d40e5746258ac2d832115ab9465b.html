<h1>PNC selling its stake in Blackrock</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PNC Financial Services Group announced Monday that it plans to sell its roughly 22% stake in Blackrock Inc., the world’s largest money manager.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh-based PNC holds a total of nearly 35 million common and Series B preferred shares, which convert into common shares, in the New York mutual fund company.</p>
<p>The move would give the Pittsburgh bank a large chunk of cash that it could use for acquisitions, although CEO William Demchak has said in the past that PNC was not looking to take over a large bank.</p>
<p>Mr. Demchak said in a statement Monday that the time was right to “unlock the value of our investment.”</p>
<p>The sale would give PNC a substantial return on the investment, enhance its balance sheet and liquidity, and leave the bank “very well-positioned to take advantage of potential investment opportunities that history has shown can arise in disrupted markets,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition to the economic benefit of the sale, Mr. Demchak said the divestiture would “eliminate any regulatory obligations associated with the ownership of a large position in another diversified financial services company.”</p>
<p>PNC spokeswoman Marcey Zwiebel declined further comment.</p>
<p>PNC will offer the shares in a public secondary offering. As part of the transaction, Blackrock will buy back $1.1 billion shares directly from PNC. The bank also expects to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to buy an additional 10% of shares offered.</p>
<p>“If the offering and repurchases are completed and the underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares,” then PNC will have sold its entire holding in Blackrock, excluding 500,000 shares that it is retaining for a donation to the PNC Foundation by the end of the second quarter, the bank said.</p>
<p>PNC purchased a 100% stake in Blackrock for $240 million in 1995, selling off portions of its ownership over the years. Speculation has swirled for years about how long PNC would continue to hold on to the investment.</p>
<p>PNC’s announcement was made after the close of the stock market Monday. The bank’s shares rose in after hours trading.</p>
