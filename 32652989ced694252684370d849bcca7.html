<h1>Net Health: Doing a deal without losing focus in a world turned upside down by COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The usual butterflies of acquiring a business turned into heartburn for a Strip District company earlier this year with the outbreak of the biggest pandemic in more than 100 years.</p>
<p>Net Health and Baltimore-based Tissue Analytics Inc., like businesses everywhere, closed their offices in the spring and sent employees packing to work remotely as COVID-19 raged. Executives from both companies re-examined the core assumptions of Net Health’s plans to acquire the Maryland operation and considered whether it still made sense in a world turned on its head by the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>In the end, Net Health acquired Tissue Analytics in March, absorbing its 28 employees and picking up a leading role in marrying machine-learning and medicine.&nbsp;“We were able to manage through it,” said Jason Baim, chief strategy and development officer at Net Health. “It worked out surprisingly well.”</p>

<p>Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>In some ways, the timing of the Net Health-Tissue Analytics deal could not have been worse. Walloped by COVID-19, global merger and acquisition activity fell 28% in the quarter ending March 31 compared to a year ago, according to a report by data software platform company NXTsoft, which is based in Birmingham, Ala.</p>
<p>But the deal succeeded for the same reasons that any business deal works: Despite a rising tide of illness and economic turmoil caused by the disease, the fundamentals of the transaction were sound and nobody panicked and lost sight of that, executives from both companies said.</p>
<p>Net Health is generally seen as a Pittsburgh life sciences success story.</p>
<p>The company’s software crunches data on the best medical outcomes and uses them to recommend guidance to&nbsp;doctors and others involved with chronic wound care, physical rehabilitation and other medical specialties. In its 25 years, the firm has built up a client base of 14,000 medical facilities.</p>
<p>The company has been on a steep growth curve: In 2013, Net Health had 55 employees and $10 million in revenue; today, it employs 500 people, and revenue exceeds $100 million, executives said.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the company was acquired by a consortium consisting of&nbsp;the Carlyle Group, an investment firm; Level Equity, a software-focused growth equity investor; and Net Health management.</p>
<p>Tissue Analytics, which was founded in Baltimore in 2014 and has an office in Kansas City, developed its own treatment algorithms and added artificial intelligence-powered software to guide clinicians in the treatment of chronic wounds such as slow healing burns.</p>
<p>One jewel that attracted Net Health’s interest was Tissue Analytics’ smartphone app, which allows patients to photograph chronic wounds for remote evaluation by a doctor.</p>
<p>The Baltimore company was already offering use of the app for patients and clinicians without charge, which encouraged clinicians to try it. Doctors and nurses using the app could be potential customers for Tissue Analytics’ products in the future.</p>
<p>The app also was exactly the kind of thing Net Health had been planning to create. The company&nbsp;had long recognized machine-learning was the future for its products. It had been&nbsp;aware of Tissue Analytics’ work for several years and had become interested in buying the company as a strategic investment, said Net Health’s CEO, Josh Pickus.</p>
<p>In addition to the smartphone picture app, which allows wound healing pictures to become part of the patient’s electronic medical record, Tissue Analytics opened the door to inpatient clinicians and involvement in clinical trials. Net Health’s strength had been sales to outpatient clinics.</p>
<p>The pandemic and the associated economic slowdown did cause some hiccups in the deal, which included delays to allow for careful review of revenue and value projections.</p>
<p>“The simple answer to how do you do a meaningfully sized acquisition in the middle of COVID-19 is all about conviction,” Mr. Pickus said. “The hard part is: How do you stay the course? You can’t lose your nerve. You can’t lose faith just because of COVID. That’s the real learning.”</p>
<p>Staying the course meant Net Health doubling down on its due diligence: Would COVID-19 erode the value of Tissue Analytics’ products; was COVID-19 hammering the company’s sales; was it possible to fully assess the company’s culture without visiting its offices?</p>
<p>The same tools that each company was using to stay connected during the pandemic, such as Slack and Zoom, proved effective windows into their corporate cultures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“My biggest fear, the biggest unknown was the environment,” Net Health chief financial officer Patrick Rooney said. “A lot of customers are right in the middle of treating patients in this pandemic.”</p>
<p>A deal that was in the works well before the pandemic hit was already a learning experience for Tissue Analytics’ co-founder Kevin Keenahan who was new to acquisitions. So, he turned to board members who were familiar with dealmaking for advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, he concluded, “the deal would make sense regardless of COVID.”</p>
<p>Kicking the tires, peeking under the hood, the second and third look at the numbers in a rapidly changing market only underscored the value of the investment, Mr. Rooney said.</p>
<p>“In any transaction, once you know it’s good strategically, you need to make a decision and go,” he said. “The numbers will be the numbers. At some point, it’s about the belief this will make you better.”</p>
