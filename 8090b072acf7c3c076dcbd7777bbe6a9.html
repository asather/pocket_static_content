<h1>FDA warns about EpiPen malfunctions </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration is warning that Mylan’s EpiPen and EpiPen Jr. emergency auto-injectors could be prevented from properly injecting under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The warning — which also applies to Mylan’s authorized generic versions — follows a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/136389/download" target="_blank">March 23 letter</a>&nbsp;to health care professionals from Mylan and Pfizer, the manufacturer of the EpiPen. The letter details how the devices may activate prematurely if the blue safety release is removed using a sideways force. For example, users may try to hold an EpiPen with one hand and try to remove the safety release with their thumb.</p>
<p>A very limited number of devices also may have a blue safety release that is slightly raised, which could cause the auto-injector to activate prematurely, the letter said.</p>
<p>In addition, EpiPens may not slide out of their tube easily, or at all, due to&nbsp;a deformed rim&nbsp;on the carrier tube.</p>
<p>The letter also identified a number of user errors that could cause problems.</p>
<p>EpiPens are used to combat life-threatening allergic reactions, such as reactions to foods and insect bites.</p>
<p>The letter said it is important for health care providers, patients and caregivers to periodically review the EpiPen user instructions and practice using the EpiPen trainer.</p>
<p>Patients should contact Mylan customer relations at 800-796-9526 if they find an issue with their auto-injector to obtain a replacement at no additional cost.</p>
<p>FDA said it is aware of adverse event reports associated with EpiPen products. It is asking health care professionals and consumers to report any adverse reactions or quality problems to the FDA’s MedWatch program at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch-fda-safety-information-and-adverse-event-reporting-program" target="_blank">www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm</a>.</p>
