<h1>Rochester man gets decade in prison for recording sex with 14-year-old girl</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Beaver County man is headed to federal prison for a decade for possessing videos of himself having sex with a teenage girl.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Joy Flowers Conti imposed that term on Elijah Winchester, 23, of Rochester.</p>
<p>Winchester had previously pleaded guilty to possession of material depicting the sexual exploitation of a child related to explicit videos found on his phone in 2018.</p>
<p>He was 21 at the time, and she was 14.</p>
<p>The case began in the spring of 2018 when police in Beaver acquired evidence that Winchester was having sex with the girl. They questioned him and he denied it.</p>
<p>But when officers received more evidence, they got a search warrant for his phone.</p>
<p>On it they found 14 sex videos involving the girl. The faces of Winchester and the victim were visible in some and in others the girl was identified by her navel piercing.</p>
<p>All of the videos were created on May 16 and 17 in 2018.</p>
<p>In addition to the 10-year prison term, Winchester will be on probation for seven years.</p>
