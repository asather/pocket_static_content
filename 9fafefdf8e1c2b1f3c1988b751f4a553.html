<h1>Megabus carrying passengers from Pittsburgh to NYC crashes in New Jersey </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Megabus carrying nearly 50 passengers, some of whom traveled from Pittsburgh, was involved in an accident on its way to New York City early Tuesday.</p>
<p>The bus collided with a tractor trailer shortly after 5:30 a.m. heading eastbound in on Interstate 80 in Blairstown, N.J., according to Sgt. Jeff Flynn of the New Jersey state police.</p>
<p>The bus picked up passengers in Pittsburgh at 11 p.m. Monday on its way to New York. It had 48 passengers on board including the driver, Sgt. Flynn said.</p>
<p>Local visual artist Vanessa German, of Homewood, told the Post-Gazette that she was on her way to an art show at Park Avenue Armory in New York City when the bus crashed.</p>
<p>Ms. German first alerted her friends of the incident on Facebook at about 8 a.m., describing it as “scary,” and claimed that the driver had swerved across lanes hours before the accident just outside of State College, Pa.</p>
<p>“All of a sudden I heard people screaming,” she said. “I thought someone was having a medical emergency.” Ms. German, who was sitting on the upper deck of the bus, said after the bus swerved there were passengers in the front on the lower level who claimed the driver had fell asleep. The driver told passengers that the bus was having transmission problems, she said.</p>
<p>“After the bus swerved so bad and people were screaming, I didn’t think I was going to be able to go back to sleep.” But Ms. German did eventually doze back off, only to wake to the sound of the bus wrecking into the back of the truck.</p>

<p>New Jersey state police said only minor injuries were reported, but Ms. German said several riders were bleeding while others had head injuries as nearly a dozen rescue crews responded to the scene about 15 minutes later.</p>
<p>She said some riders chose to go to a hospital while others were fearful of getting stuck in New Jersey and continued their trip on to New York once Megabus sent another bus.</p>
<p>Sgt. Flynn said the incident was reported as a “minor crash” and did not have details on how many passengers were taken to the hospital from the scene.</p>
<p>Ms. German said both the bus driver and tractor trailer driver were OK.</p>
<p>Director Corporate Affairs for Coach USA Sean Hughes said in a statement sent to the Post-Gazette that Megabus.com was aware of the accident and was fully cooperating with the local authorities.</p>
<p>“The safety of our passengers and employees is our top priority,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Ms. German, who injured her knees in the accident, said no Megabus staff members spoke directly to passengers once they arrived in New York several hours later.</p>
<p>She was thankful that she fastened her seatbelt after the bus swerved, she said, as her injuries weren’t as severe as those who were lying down on their seats.</p>
