<h1>Mark Cuban wants to buy the Original Hot Dog Shop</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mark Cuban is trying to save a Pittsburgh institution. No, it’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/07/30/pittsburgh-pirates-owner-mark-cuban-dallas-mavericks-bob-nutting/stories/201907300055" target="_blank">not the Pirates.</a></p>
<p>Instead, the Mt. Lebanon native, Dallas Mavericks owner and “Shark Tank” star is working to revive the Original Hot Dog Shop in Oakland, a staple of the Pitt campus he once walked as an undergrad.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/food/2020/04/29/Original-Hot-Dog-Shop-Pittsburgh-restaurant-french-fries-closed-free-potatoes/stories/202004290002" target="_blank">The restaurant shuttered last month</a> after 60 years in business. Its iconic neon signs are now gone, to the dismay of many who spent their college days savoring its celebrated French fries inside its location at the intersection of&nbsp;South Bouquet Street and Forbes Avenue.</p>
<p>Cuban offered those folks some hope Thursday during an interview with Pat McAfee, himself a Pittsburgh-area&nbsp;native and West Virginia football alum who’s now an analyst for ESPN.</p>

<p>“We’re not done trying to buy the Dirty O, man,” Cuban said, using the restaurant’s nickname.</p>
<p>“I’m still out there trying to find a way to buy it. It’s not over yet for those Pittsburghers out there.”</p>
<p>McAfee responded by saying Cuban would be a “hero” if he completed the deal, at which point Cuban offered some caution.</p>
<p>“I’m trying,” he added. “It’s a longshot. They’re making it hard, bro. They’re making it hard. They’re closed. It’s easy, just sell me this stuff. And they’re like … they’re over-negotiating. So we’ll see what happens.”</p>
<p>Forbes estimates Cuban’s worth at $4.3 billion and ranks him as No. 414 on the list of the world’s richest people. Before making his fortune, he attended Pitt for one year before transferring to Indiana University, from which he graduated in 1981.</p>
