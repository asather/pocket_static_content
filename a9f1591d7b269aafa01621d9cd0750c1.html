<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh on Monday temporarily suspended the distribution of communion wine and instituted a no-contact policy for the ritual sign of peace during Masses in an effort to prevent <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/02/allegheny-county-health-department-coronavirus-preparation-pittsburgh-covid-19/stories/202003020074" target="_blank">the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>Bishop David Zubik also ordered that fonts of holy water be cleaned and drained weekly, and he said that anyone feeling ill is not obligated to attend Sunday Mass.</p>
<p>“It’s important to point out that there are no confirmed cases of the coronavirus illness in Pennsylvania,” Bishop Zubik said in a statement. “However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as local healthcare agencies, are encouraging preparation and precaution as the situation continues to be monitored.”</p>
<p>He said these are “preventative steps to help our faith community, and the region as a whole, stay healthy.”</p>
<p>The diocese is the largest religious body in the region, covering Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Greene, Lawrence and Washington counties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its churches hold scores of Masses each week.</p>
<p>Typically communion wine is given from a shared cup.</p>
<p>During the sign of the peace at Mass, worshipers typically greet other parishioners nearby with handshakes or other gestures such as hugs.</p>
