<p>WILKES-BARRE, Pa. — An altercation over a man’s refusal to remove a “Make America Great Again” hat triggered a recent active shooter scare at a Pennsylvania mall, police said.</p>
<p>The altercation started outside when a man confronted another man wearing the hat in support of President Donald Trump inside the Wyoming Valley Mall in Wilkes-Barre on Dec. 30, authorities said Tuesday. The man threatened to assault the Trump supporter if he did not remove his hat, and then tried to knock it off his head.</p>
<p>Police say the man wearing the hat then pulled a gun out and pointed it at the ground, prompting the other man to flee the scene.</p>
<p>The tense dispute spread on social media and caused a panic at the mall, the Citizens Voice reported.</p>
<p>Wilkes-Barre Township Police Chief Will Clark said firearms are not permitted inside the mall, but the altercation happened near the Macy’s inside the mall. The armed man had a concealed carry permit, and Clark said no charges will be filed against him.</p>
<p>Political differences prompted the altercation, Clark said, adding that the assailant is “obviously not a proponent of Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>Police have not identified either of the men involved in the row. Clark said police are looking for the other man involved in the confrontation.</p>
