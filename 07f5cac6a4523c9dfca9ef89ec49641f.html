<h1>Ron Cook: Steelers need to fix their running game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>James Conner? Benny Snell Jr.? Does it really matter? Both have to play better. Certainly, the Steelers’ run game has to be a lot better than it was Sunday against the Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>Mike Tomlin went with Conner as his starter after a week of heated debate from outsiders. Most observers preferred Snell, who ran for 113 yards on 19 carries in the win against the New York Giants last Monday night in relief of a yet-again injured Conner. Tomlin made the right call with Conner. You don’t give up on your “bell cow” — Tomlin’s words — after just one game. You don’t go to the lesser-experienced Snell, in just his second season, so quickly even though the Steelers had been 5-1 when he had at least 10 carries and 2-6 when he did not.</p>
<p>Conner justified Tomlin’s faith with a 59-yard run that iced the 26-21 win against the Broncos. Running behind pulling guard Matt Feiler and fullback Derek Watt — can you believe a fullback in a Steelers game? — Conner rumbled to the Denver 10 with 1:30 left. Two more plays and the Steelers left the Heinz Field lawn with an ugly win — if there is such a thing — and a 2-0 record.</p>
<p>It was hard to tell if Conner was more excited about contributing to the win with a big play or not pulling a hamstring or twisting an ankle or bruising a shoulder on the long run. You know his injury history. It is worse than any Alfred Hitchcock horror movie.</p>
<p>Conner started fast, his first carry going for 8 yards, which was just 1 fewer yard than he had on six carries against the Giants. He had another 11-yard gain on the Steelers’ second possession and completed it with a 2-yard touchdown run. That brought back memories of his 2018 season when he scored 12 rushing touchdowns.</p>
<p>But the Steelers’ run game struggled mightily after that. Between Conner’s touchdown and his 59-yard run, the team had 15 carries for 26 yards.</p>
<p>It was so bad that, after the Broncos pulled within five points with 7:43 left, Ben Roethlisberger threw on four consecutive plays before the Steelers punted. There didn’t appear to be any consideration to wrapping up the game on the ground the way the Steelers used to do regularly when Jerome Bettis was toting the pig.</p>
<p>Blame Snell a bit for that.</p>
<p>The Steelers had complete control of the game after a Denver safety on a botched punt gave them a 26-14 lead and then the ball at the Denver 48 after the free kick. But Snell, getting just his third carry of the game, fumbled on the first play after being hit by defensive end Shelby Harris. The Broncos made him pay for the turnover, scoring a touchdown to make the score 26-21.</p>
<p>Of all players, Conner probably felt Snell’s pain the worst. His fumbles in Cleveland and Denver in 2018 led to a tie and a crushing loss, and his late fumble at San Francisco early last season was primarily responsible for another loss.</p>
<p>It was the second game in a row that Snell fumbled. He got lucky against the Giants when JuJu Smith-Schuster seemed to outfight half of the Giants’ team to recover the loose football.</p>
<p>“I know that I’ve got some concern because we’ve got to maintain possession of the ball, particularly in those significant moments,” Tomlin said when asked about Snell’s fumbles. “He’s a young guy growing in terms of situational awareness of things like that. I’m sure there will be a growth experience for him, but we’ve got some work to do there.”</p>
<p>That’s why Conner was back in the game after the Steelers’ defense stopped Denver on third- and fourth-down plays from the Pittsburgh 15 in the final two minutes. Conner, clearly hanging on to the ball with both hands, ran for 4 yards and then broke the big play. He finished with a misleading 106 yards on 16 carries. His 15 carries, other than his big run, went for 47 yards.</p>
<p>The run game needs to improve. Maybe part of the problem was that the Steelers gave Chuks Okorafor just his second significant NFL start in place of injured right tackle Zach Banner and started rookie Kevin Dotson at right guard in place of injured David DeCastro. Tomlin said he needed to review the game tape before passing judgment on Okorafor, Dotson and the rest of his offensive linemen. Of course he said that, but he added their play “was good enough to win.” The Broncos, playing without injured All-Pro linebacker Von Miller, managed just one sack.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger ended up throwing 41 times, which is too many times. He threw nine consecutive times on one third-quarter drive. He talked afterward of needing to play better, but a little more production from his ground game would make his job easier and his offense more productive.</p>
<p>“The defense bailed us out numerous times,” Roethlisberger said. “They won the game for us, no doubt.”</p>
<p>You might not have agreed with Tomlin’s decision to start Conner instead of Snell and then, largely, stick with him, but you can’t possibly disagree with his postgame assessment:</p>
<p>“We’ve got a lot of growth ahead of us,” he said. “We were far from perfect. We’re thankful for the win.”</p>
