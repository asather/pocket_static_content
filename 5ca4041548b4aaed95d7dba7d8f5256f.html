<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Education on Tuesday announced&nbsp;more than $925,000 in competitive grants for schools across the state to&nbsp;purchase of new food service equipment for cafeterias.</p>
<p>The grants are funded through the&nbsp;U.S. Department of Agriculture and is awarded to schools which participate in the National School Lunch Program and have 50% or more of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals.</p>
<p>“Students perform better in school when they have access to regular, nutritious meals,” Pedro A. Rivera, Pennsylvania’s secretary of education, said in a statement. “These grants will help schools upgrade equipment so they can continue to provide the essential meals that students need.”</p>
<p>More than 10 schools in Allegheny, Beaver and Washington counties are among the 72 that received grants, including Homeville Elementary, Clara Barton Elementary and West Mifflin Area High School in the West Mifflin Area School District; Barrett Elementary and Steel Valley High School in the Steel Valley School District; and Trinity North Elementary in the Trinity Area School District.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schools will use the grants to purchase new refrigerators, freezers, stoves and dishwashers and other equipment.</p>
<p>The amount of money distributed to schools ranges from about $2,400 to more than $47,000.</p>
