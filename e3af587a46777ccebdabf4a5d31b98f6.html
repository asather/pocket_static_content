<p>In her usual routine, Kathleen Kehler called her husband on her way to church Sunday morning in Lebanon, Pa.</p>
<p>When her husband, Dennis, didn’t answer, she tried calling his co-worker,&nbsp;Daniel Kepner. The two&nbsp;UPS drivers were traveling together and had been on the road early Sunday and were headed toward Louisville, Ky.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He did the daytime driving, and his partner did night time driving,” Ms. Kehler said Tuesday.&nbsp;“I always called him on my way to church and he didn't answer, so I figured they got a late start. I tried to call his partner and he didn’t answer, so I just thought something came up.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t until after church and later that morning — as well as several missed calls later — that Ms. Kehler learned her husband of 14 years was among the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/01/05/Multiple-people-killed-crash-fatal-Pennsylvania-Turnpike-Westmoreland-County/stories/202001050147" target="_blank">five people killed in a multi-vehicle crash</a> on the Pennsylvania Turnpike before 3 a.m. Sunday. Dozens more were injured in the crash, whose cause remains under investigation.</p>
<p>That morning, a tour bus carrying 56 people and traveling westbound from New York City lost control and flipped over, resulting in a chain-reaction crash near mile marker 86 in Mount Pleasant, Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>Ms. Kehler’s granddaughter had tried to call her about seven times prior to church ending, but she missed the calls while attending service. Eventually, a friend of her husband’s&nbsp;spoke to her over the phone and asked if she was OK, and if she had seen the news.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘please don’t tell me my husband is dead,’ ” Ms. Kehler said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Kepner, 53, of Lewistown, Pa., had been with UPS for five years and Mr. Kehler, 48, served the company for 28 years, officials said.</p>
<p>Also killed in the crash were bus driver Shuang Qing Feng, 58, of Flushing, N.Y.; bus passenger Eileen Zelis Aria, 35, of Bronx, N.Y.; and bus passenger Jaremy Vazquez, 9, of Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>
<p>“I have my moments,” said Ms. Kehler, 61, as she discussed how she’s coping. “I'm good one minute, the next minute I cry. I just want to be able to tell people what kind of person [Dennis] was.”</p>
<p>The Lebanon native was a hunter and enjoyed fishing, Ms. Kehler said. His grandson and son-in-law would often accompany him. He also liked to spend his time&nbsp;shooting targets almost an hour north of the city in&nbsp;Schuylkill County, she said.</p>
<p>“He was outgoing, and always tried to make people laugh,” she said.&nbsp;“He was happy-go-lucky. It had to be really bad for him to get upset. He was just a guy who liked to enjoy life.”</p>
<p>Often hanging out with family and his&nbsp;“buddies,” Dennis had a&nbsp;“good-natured” spirit, his wife said.</p>
<p>“He would give his last dollar, he was just that kind of person,” she said. He leaves behind one 19-year-old daughter of his own, but he also took care of her two daughters, Ms. Kehler said. He has eight grand kids, a great grandson as well.</p>
<p>The bus involved in the crash had left Flushing, N.Y., about 10 p.m. Saturday and made stops in Manhattan, N.Y., and Hackensack, N.J. It was headed toward New Stanton — where there would have been a crew swap — but the crash occurred about 10 miles before it reached that destination.</p>
<p>The transit would then have traveled from New Stanton to Cincinnati and Louisville, Ky., before returning to Flushing.</p>
<p>Bus driver Shuang Qing Feng, 58, of Flushing, N.Y.,&nbsp;and passengers Eileen Zelis Aria, 35, of Bronx, N.Y.; and Jaremy Vazquez, 9, of Brooklyn, N.Y., were also killed in the crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Jersey-based Z&amp;D Tours, which operates the bus involved in Sunday’s crash, has been in operation since around 2013, according to the transit's attorney Dru Carey. She said she wanted to dispel any rumors that the bus company was careless. They had&nbsp;received a “satisfactory” rating from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in late 2018 and reported no crashes to the agency in the 24 months prior to Sunday, according to federal records.</p>
<p>"The company, as you can imagine, is very upset," Ms. Carey said. "They've lost their driver and passengers.&nbsp;We offer our sincerest condolences to the family members and everyone involved in the accident. Our first concern is safety. We are cooperating fully with authorities.”</p>
<p>Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/01/06/Pennsylvania-State-police-more-new-details-turnpike-tragedy-crash-bus-FedEx-UPS/stories/202001060057" target="_blank">began their investigation Monday</a>.</p>
