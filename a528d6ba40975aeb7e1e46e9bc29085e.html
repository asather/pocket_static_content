<h1>Chief U.S. judge suspends all Western Pa. jury trials until the fall to combat virus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>All criminal and civil trials have been suspended until September in the federal courts in Pittsburgh, Erie and Johnstown because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak on Friday extended the current restrictions, put in place in March, until Sept. 8. A similar provision is in place in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court.</p>
<p>Judge Hornak said other proceedings will continue as they have been, such as the filing of motions and video conferencing for criminal pleas, detention hearings and sentencings. The courthouses remain open but are operating with skeleton crews as most employees work remotely.</p>
<p>Jury trials in federal court require large pools of people from across numerous counties in the region to be gathered in close proximity at the courthouses, the judge said, subjecting them to risk from the virus. In addition, the judge noted that the "fragility of the current employment situation" for prospective jurors would increase the hardship on being summoned. That would increase the number of jurors who would need to be excused, increasing the need for larger and larger pools of summoned jurors and generating even larger gatherings.</p>
<p>The judge said another problem is that the detention centers and jails that house federal pre-trial detainees have had to curtail interactions between inmates and their lawyers, affecting the ability of defense attorneys to prepare for trials.</p>
<p>Special court programs, such as veterans' court and the RISE court, will also continue to be suspended.</p>
<p>The judge said the U.S. courts will continue to do what they can to mitigate the spread of the virus in accordance with the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
