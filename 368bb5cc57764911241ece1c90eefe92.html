<h1>Bullpen encounters more problems in Pirates’ loss to Indians</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CLEVELAND — A two-game sample size is hardly legitimate — yes, even when facing a 60-game sprint — but given what Pirates relievers have endured during the past two exhibition games against the Indians, it's also a little bit startling, especially considering that Pittsburgh needs its bullpen to be a strength.</p>
<p>Since the start of spring training 2.0, a previous area of depth has lost Edgar Santana (PED suspension) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/20/keone-kela-pittsburgh-pirates-closer-summer-camp-opening-day-covid-19/stories/202007200060" target="_blank">Keone Kela</a> (undisclosed), while their primary back-end guys have scuffled during a pair of losses.</p>
<p>At the sam time, it's also two games, and this was largely expected; while starters can build their arms through side work and conditioning, the only true way to replicate coming out of the bullpen is to ... well, come out of the bullpen.</p>
<p>"The one concern that is going to go throughout the league is just making sure your relievers stay ramped up," manager Derek Shelton said after his team dropped an 11-7 decision at Progressive Field. "It’s good for our guys to get work.</p>
<p>"We saw those guys in the middle against some really good hitters, and when we didn’t execute pitches, they put really good swings on them. Some of that has to do with the fact that the guys hitting in the middle of their order are really good."</p>
<p>The game turned in the middle innings with Richard Rodriguez and Michael Feliz pitching ... and giving up home runs, which has been a recurring theme for them.</p>
<p>Rodriguez coughed up nine during his first 26 appearances in 2019. Feliz closed the season by allowing six home runs in his final 14 times out.</p>
<p>They both endured really good parts, too. Feliz struck out 73 batters in 56 1/3 innings, while Rodriguez put together a stretch of 27 appearances where he allowed just one earned run and no extra-base hits.</p>
<p>So, it’s there. But it hasn’t been thus far, and the Pirates need it to arrive soon. Just consider these stat lines in the Pirates’ two exhibition games:</p>
<p>• Kyle Crick: 1/3 innings, two hits, four earned runs, two walks</p>
<p>• Nick Burdi: one inning, two hits, one earned run, two strikeouts, hit batter</p>
<p>• Rodriguez: one inning, three hits, four earned runs, one walk, one strikeout and two home runs</p>
<p>• Feliz: one inning, one hit, one earned run, two strikeouts and one home run</p>
<p>On a positive note, there was plenty to like in Trevor Williams’ final start before he takes the ball against the Cardinals for the second game of the season.</p>
<p>After throwing just 21 curveballs all of last season, Williams has focused on using that pitch more — and did so against the Indians. Of his 55 pitches, six were curveballs, including four at the start of a count.</p>
<p>The pitch had good action and was a solid complement to not only his slider but also his four-seam fastball, sinker and changeup.</p>
<p>“We were able to execute it in situations where we wanted to execute it and get a feel for it early in the game both from the windup and the stretch,” Williams said.</p>
<p>Monday also marked Cole Tucker’s first taste of the outfield, and he fared reasonably well — although after kind of an ironic start, with the very first pitch hit his way.</p>
<p>An inning later, after Tucker shifted to center field, he made a sliding catch at the wall, one that likely brought with it a momentary sense of panic from manager Derek Shelton.</p>
<p>“I felt athletic out there,” Tucker said. “That was exciting because I’ve never really done that, but it kind of felt natural and felt like second nature.”</p>
<p>Williams worked 2 2/3 innings and allowed one run on two hits. That came in the third inning when left fielder Bradley Zimmer doubled with one out, Williams reached his pitch count and Chris Stratton allowed a run-scoring single to Indians third baseman Jose Ramirez.</p>
<p>Indians shortstop Francisco Lindor tied the score, 2-2, with his double to center.</p>
<p>The Pirates built a 2-0 lead in the top of the second inning after Phillip Evans belted a two-run homer 410 feet into the seats in left-center field. It was a great at-bat from Evans, too, as he battled with two strikes and eventually drove an elevated fastball from Indians starter Mike Clevinger over the fence.</p>
<p>Another offseason addition, Guillermo Heredia, added a jolt of power in the fifth inning with a solo homer of his own. Also coming off Clevinger, Heredia found an 0-1 fastball — also up in the zone — and drove it into the right-field seats.</p>
<p>After a single and a walk put two men on, Rodriguez fed Lindor a slider on the inside part of the plate and a little down. It wasn’t a terrible pitch, but like many left-handed hitters in that spot, Lindor put the perfect swing on it to extend Cleveland’s lead to 6-3.</p>
<p>Former Pirate Jordan Luplow made it 7-3 with a solo shot later that inning, this time capitalizing on a four-seam fastball from Rodriguez that was in a much worse place: up in the zone.</p>
<p>"Adrenaline-wise, guys are going to have to get used to coming into a stadium with no fans in certain situations," Shelton said. "I think it’s just getting the work in."</p>
