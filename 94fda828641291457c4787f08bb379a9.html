<h1>Former player Rasir Bolton says Patrick Chambers' comments prompted transfer from Penn State</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former Penn State basketball player has cited comments from coach Patrick Chambers as the reason he transferred away from the university a year ago.</p>
<p>Rasir Bolton, now a guard at Iowa State, told <a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/noose-comment-by-penn-state-basketball-coach-points-to-larger-ncaa-problem/" target="_blank">The Undefeated’s Jesse Washington</a> in a story published Monday that Chambers first made a troubling remark while trying to comfort him during a slump in early 2019.</p>
<p>“I want to be a stress reliever for you,” Chambers told Bolton, then a freshman. “You can talk to me about anything. I need to get some of this pressure off you.</p>
<p>“I want to loosen the noose that’s around your neck.”</p>
<p>The reference to a noose bothered Bolton, who said spoke with his parents and an academic adviser about the incident. A pair of conversations with Chambers followed, and he expressed remorse for choosing that analogy, which carries racial connotations because of the use of nooses in lynchings.</p>
<p>Later, however, Chambers told Bolton “he was impressed with how ‘organized’ and ‘well-spoken’ his parents were,” Washington writes. Bolton found those comments problematic as well.</p>
<p>At season’s end, Bolton sought to transfer. After telling the NCAA of the incident, he was granted immediate eligibility at Iowa State, where he averaged nearly 15 points per game this past season.</p>
<p>For his part, Chambers repeated his apology in an interview with Washington last week.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize that word would hurt him, and I am truly, truly sorry for that,” Chambers said, citing his personal and professional roots in northern cities as a reason he was unaware of the symbolism of nooses in Black communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chambers’ inclusion on a National Association of Basketball Coaches panel addressing racial injustice prompted Bolton to speak out because he felt disrespected again. He also addressed the incident on his Twitter account Monday.</p>
<p>Chambers and athletic director Sandy Barbour released their own statements via Twitter as well.&nbsp;</p>
