<h1>McKees Rocks man charged with abusing 3-week-old baby girl </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A McKees Rocks man has been charged with aggravated assault and child endangerment after his 3-week-old daughter was physically abused and left in critical condition with head injuries last month. The young girl died Thursday morning, according to the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office.</p>
<p>Robert Andrews, 33, of Stowe, is being held at the Allegheny County Jail without bond following a March 12 incident where his daughter was hospitalized.</p>
<p>Just before 3 a.m. that day, Mr. Andrews called 911 and reported his child was unconscious and not breathing. The baby girl was taken to UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, where doctors determined the child had suffered major physical child abuse and head trauma, a criminal complaint said. Her injuries caused temporary and “likely permanent impairment, as well as substantial pain,” police said in a complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Andrews was charged and arrested March 23.</p>
<p>“Due to the vicious nature of these charges, steps have been taken to keep this defendant incarcerated,” said DA spokesman Mike Manko. The child’s cause of death is pending autopsy results.</p>
<p>Mr. Andrews was the sole caretaker of the girl on March 12, while the child’s mother was away at Saint Claire Hospital with an infection. The child was healthy, Mr. Andrews told police, and he had just taken the child to see her mother at the hospital the day before. He said he came home around 11:30 p.m., changed and fed the baby, swaddled her in a blanket and laid her on the couch, a criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>After moving from near the couch to smoke a cigarette in the basement doorway, Mr. Andrews told police he went back to the couch and tapped the child on her side. That’s when he learned she was unresponsive, a criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>Mr. Andrews said he called his mother, who was on the second floor of the house, for assistance. She took the child to living room and tried CPR until police arrived.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the criminal complaint, Dr. Adelaide Eichman said the child would have shown symptoms of abuse immediately following the injury.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“From a medical perspective, [the] child sustained injuries shortly before [the] cardiac arrest. If child was normal, as reported, while visiting her mother at the hospital, [the] child had not yet sustained her injuries,” Dr. Eichman said in police records.</p>
<p>Mr. Andrews is also currently awaiting trial on another set of aggravated assault and child endangerment charges stemming from a 2018 incident.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for April 21 before&nbsp;District Judge Bruce&nbsp;J. Boni.</p>
