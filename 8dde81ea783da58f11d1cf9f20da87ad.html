<h1>More American evacuees from China’s coronavirus epicenter arrive in the U.S.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Daisy Roth shepherded her two small daughters, Abigail and Adalynn, through the hushed city of Wuhan, China, past airport checkpoints and United States Embassy workers in hazmat gear, and onto a hollowed-out plane with bare white walls and dark blue seats, 10 across.</p>
<p>Back home in Neenah, Wis., Ms. Roth’s husband, Sam, was glued to his screens, tracking the plane’s progress online for hours, anxious for the flight arranged by the State Department to leave China and land in United States.</p>
<p>About 350 Americans who had been in Wuhan as the outbreak worsened and as ways to depart China grew rare were flown out on two government-arranged planes overnight on Tuesday, arriving in California before dawn on Wednesday. It was a second wave of American evacuations after an earlier flight arrived last week. At least one more government flight was expected later in the week to deliver passengers to bases in Nebraska and Texas.</p>
<p>The evacuees are caught up in a global health emergency that seems to worsen by the day. The little-understood coronavirus has killed nearly 500 people, mostly in mainland China, but it has also spread panic and anger around the world as the cases grow.</p>
<p>As thousands of hospital workers in Hong Kong went on strike to demand the border with mainland China be closed completely, the city announced that all people entering from the mainland, including Hong Kong residents, must be quarantined for 14 days. Tokyo Olympics organizers, meanwhile, said they are increasingly worried about the disruption the virus is causing ahead of the games, which open in less than six months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thousands of passengers were stranded on two cruise ships in Japan and Hong Kong on Wednesday due to reports of coronavirus infections on board</p>
<p>For the evacuated Americans’ part, days in quarantine on military bases were expected as part of a strict and highly unusual protocol federal officials have put in place to slow the spread of the outbreak.</p>
<p>But even some passengers on the flights seemed unsure exactly where their plane would land, where they would go next and how long they would be isolated from the outside world. In the hours before they departed China, speculation floated among the passengers, who posted rumors in the WeChat messaging app about the accommodations at military bases where they might be placed. Masks covering their noses and mouths — even for children — were ubiquitous.</p>
<p>For Mr. Roth, who works for a paper-goods manufacturer in Neenah, the flight brought both anxieties and risks. Ms. Roth and the girls seemed healthy, already isolated in Wuhan for weeks to avoid exposure to the fast-spreading coronavirus, but the experience of traveling for what was supposed to be a happy family reunion with her parents had left Ms. Roth exhausted.</p>
<p>And in some respects, a quarantine now was welcome: It would not go over well if Ms. Roth and the girls had been allowed to arrive in their community, fresh off a flight from Wuhan, the sprawling epicenter of the outbreak, Mr. Roth said. In the United States, 12 cases of coronavirus have been identified, including a new case that was confirmed in Wisconsin on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“To be honest, just because I don’t really want the backlash of people thinking that my family is bringing the disease here,” he said. “I’ve not faced any discrimination or negative comments directly, but reading the paper and just seeing certain xenophobic behaviors online, I can imagine that there are people around me thinking, ‘I don’t really want the coronavirus in my community.’ And I don’t blame them.”</p>
<p>Also on the evacuation flights that arrived on Wednesday were two sisters and a niece of Guanettee Colebrooke, a Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps instructor in suburban Washington. Ms. Colebrooke said she was prepared to welcome them to her home in Virginia whenever they might be allowed to leave quarantine.</p>
<p>Her sisters, LaVana and Luanettee, were studying for advanced degrees in Wuhan, and had spent weeks holed up in their apartments in that city with bottled water and canned food.</p>
<p>“They feel so sad that there are so many people who are unable to be evacuated,” Ms. Colebrooke said. Her sisters made a simple calculation, she said: “They were like, ‘If we can get out of here, let’s get out.’”</p>
<p>Ningxi Xu, a 30-year-old asset manager from New Jersey, said she was thrilled to be among the passengers permitted to fly out of Wuhan. She had tried to secure a seat on an earlier flight after getting stranded in Wuhan during a visit with family.</p>
<p>“I spent a lot of time and effort to get myself on an evacuation flight back as soon as possible but it didn’t happen until now,” she wrote in an email as she waited to depart Wuhan.</p>
<p>She said she was uncertain about what the days ahead — in quarantine — might hold.</p>
<p>“Do you know how the conditions at the Southern California quarantine site have been?” she asked. “Do you know or think they’d allow visitors while we’re in quarantine?”</p>
<p>Four military bases in California, Colorado and Texas, have been identified as able to house people evacuated from China.</p>
<p>Passengers from the evacuation flights were expected to be accommodated at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, Calif., and at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.</p>
<p>Ying Cheng, 61, who traveled to Wuhan from Dallas in January to visit her mother, was also on one of the evacuation flights, her daughter, Jiacheng Yu, said from Texas.</p>
<p>“It’s a major first step,” said Ms. Yu, 31, who is a lawyer.</p>
