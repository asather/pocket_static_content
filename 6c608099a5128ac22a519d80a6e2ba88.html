<h1>In a hopeful move, Pittsburgh Playhouse announces new reading series for 2020-21 season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With the hope that we will be gathering in theaters and classrooms come fall, Point Park University’s Pittsburgh Playhouse has announced a new Play Reading Series for the 2020-21 season.</p>
<p>The Playhouse is taking submissions of original plays and musicals, not previously produced, and will select six. Each work will be assigned a professional director and a cast of students from Point Park’s Conservatory of Performing Arts. Rehearsals of up to two weeks will culminate in a public reading/discussion in the Playhouse’s Rauh Theatre.</p>
<p>Steven Breese, artistic director and dean of COPA, noted that the COVID-19 pandemic began as the series was being planned. It is meant to extend the Playhouse’s commitment to presenting new works — the April 3-12 premiere of a musical adaptation of “Pump Up the Volume” was canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reading series adds to programming at the Downtown campus venue, which dropped the Playhouse Rep and Playhouse Jr. series that were staples of the former Playhouse in Oakland.</p>
<p>“We wanted to recognize the ongoing impact of the pandemic on our lives and will be actively seeking one new play to interpret this time, in a meaningful way,” said Breese.</p>
<p>Other suggested criteria include, multiethnic casts, strong female protagonists and contemporary social and political issues. The process is electronic submissions only, accepted June 1-July 1, 2020 at ArtisticDirector@pointpark.edu.</p>
<p>Selected plays are expected to be announced by Sept. 1, 2020. For details about formats and more, visit pittsburghplayhouse.com.</p>
