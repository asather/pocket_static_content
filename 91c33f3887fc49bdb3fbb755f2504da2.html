<h1>State task force seeks answers on health disparity in coronavirus's impact</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In mid-April, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and Lt. Gov. John Fetterman jointly announced the creation of a COVID-19 Response Task Force for Health Disparity to address growing concern that the novel coronavirus was disproportionately affecting minority populations in the state and adding to existing health disparity.</p>
<p>The task force has been meeting weekly in hopes of presenting short- and long-term recommendations to the governor this summer on how to remove obstacles to health equity for marginalized communities, said Julie Strickland-Gilliard, Western Pennsylvania regional director of Lt. Gov. John Fetterman’s office and a task force member.</p>
<p>Mr. Fetterman chairs the task force, which includes officials from the state Department of Health’s Office of Health Equity and representatives from the African American, Latino, Asian Pacific American, women and LGBTQ communities.</p>
<p>“We’re identifying issues related to COVID-19 so we can let the governor know what can be done right now,” Ms. Strickland-Gilliard said. “We are all connecting with stakeholders, anyone from the affected communities — activists, nonprofit and business leaders, elected officials — so we can share information.</p>
<p>“We are going to be examining what can be done in the short term, but we are also focused on long-term policy issues. How can we do things better to support these communities, not just short-term but in the long term?”</p>
<p>In its first month, the task force has succeeded in modifying data collection of COVID-19 cases by the state health department to include sexual orientation and gender identity. The information will be included by the health department in SARA Alert, a new demographic data-collection computer platform designed to aid in contact tracing.</p>
<p>Additionally, it has reinforced the mandate by Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine for health care providers to include race and ethnicity data for patients tested for the coronavirus. Compliance has risen from about 30-35% in the early stages of the pandemic to 70-75%, the task force reported.</p>
<p>The task force has highlighted the need for more accessible testing, including more locations, access for the uninsured, and nondiscriminatory providers. It has advocated for increased support for community health care providers and has worked to provide them and other community groups with state resources to improve their outreach.</p>
<p>More bilingual public service announcements are also on its to-do list. One recently tweeted by the state health department was created by second lady Gisele Fetterman. It says in Spanish and English: “You should wear a mask whenever you leave your house. My mask protects you, your mask protects me! ”</p>
<p>“We’re proud of the work we’ve done so far, and we’re thankful that Governor Wolf recognized the need for an entity like this task force,” Ms. Strickland-Gilliard said.</p>
