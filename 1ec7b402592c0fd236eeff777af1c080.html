<h1>Marathon runners are taking COVID-19 in stride</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After suffering a traumatic brain injury in a car accident nearly two years ago, Jenna Ann Nelson wasn’t sure she’d ever take a stroll without feeling dizzy.&nbsp; She certainly never planned on running a marathon.</p>
<p>Then eight months into her recovery, after working her way up from walking to being able to jog a few miles on a treadmill, she took a friend up on a friendly challenge to train for the 2019 Erie half marathon.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“I thought it would remind me of my strength,” she said.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old Cranberry resident loved the race so much she decided to run the full Pittsburgh marathon. Training gives her days structure and purpose, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pittsburgh-marathon/2020/03/16/pittsburgh-marathon-status-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak-running-clubs/stories/202003160096" target="_blank">May 3 marathon was canceled</a>&nbsp;because of the new coronavirus, and she and thousands of other registered runners had to decide: receive a refund or run virtually. She chose the latter.</p>
<p>“I’ve worked this hard and want to show my resilience in time of uncertainty,” said Ms. Nelson, a retreat coordinator for the nonprofit <a href="https://www.loveyourbrain.com/" target="_blank">Love Your Brain.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She will be physically alone on race weekend,&nbsp;but not mentally. Nearly 50 percent of all registrants opted for the virtual marathon, and everyone is supporting one another on their social media feeds, including through the hashtag #MOVEPittsburgh.</p>
<p>That makes Troy Schooley extremely happy. He’s the CEO of P3R, the organization behind the Dick’s Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon, one of only a handful of marathons&nbsp;across the country offering to refund entry fees.</p>
<p>“People trained for months and deserve that experience” of cheering spectators and the camaraderie of fellow runners, he said.</p>
<p>Some marathon directors have postponed their races. The Boston Marathon was originally scheduled for April 20 and is now set for Sept. 15. But many others can do little more than count registration fees toward 2021 races.&nbsp;The road race industry runs on very tight margins even during good times, Mr. Schooley said. So it’s tough for many events to continue when catastrophe strikes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You hope runners understand that and come back and support the race” the following year, he said.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh is luckier than many, he added, because it hosts&nbsp;<a href="https://p3r.org/races" target="_blank">several events</a>&nbsp;between May and November, including the 150-mile <a href="https://p3r.org/races/gap-relay" target="_blank">Great Allegheny Passage Relay </a>still set for June 19-20.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Race on Sept. 27 is also still a go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Postponing the half and full marathons wasn’t an option because it’s not as simple as just shutting down 26.2 miles of road, Mr. Schooley said. Everything from security to permitting to volunteers to ordering shirts and medals has to be planned — and paid for — many months in advance.</p>
<p>For this year’s virtual marathon, participants can register until 11:59 p.m. May 3 and have until around May 15 to complete their race. To keep runners at least 6 feet apart, the operations team has created several virtual course options in a <a href="http://www.strava.com" target="_blank">Strava</a> app.&nbsp;Finishers get medals, shirts and a pair of sunglasses along with a virtual goodie bag.</p>
<p>To keep runners motivated, the marathon on April 1 launched a <a href="/" target="_blank">virtual scavenger hunt</a>. Runners who post a photo collage of at least five finds get a chance to win one of 25 pairs of the new Brooks Running Launch 7 Pittsburgh Marathon shoe.&nbsp;They’re also encouraging the running community to participate in the #MOVEPittsburgh Spring Challenge on <a href="https://waybetter.com/runbet/games/628" target="_blank">Runbet</a>, a four-week game that challenges participants to run 3 miles (minimum), four times a week, at at least a 13 minute/mile pace.</p>
<p>Local running groups have had to adapt their training amid social distancing. <a href="https://www.fleetfeet.com/s/pittsburgh/" target="_blank">Fleet Feet Pittsburgh</a> routinely got 170 runners at its long Sunday runs,&nbsp; said race director Tim Lyman. All running club members now have access to virtual training throughout the week, with training tips, running maps, core workouts, live coaching sessions and YouTube videos.&nbsp;The store has also started virtual shoe fittings in addition to its online shopping with curb pickup.</p>
<p>Mr. Lyman said he hopes that the pandemic has a silver lining, that runners gain a little perspective on their training. With so many races canceled, they don’t have to fixate on a specific event or date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Everybody has the ability to take a more holistic approach to their running right now,” he said.</p>
<p>Annette Aho of the Strip District is one runner who’s taken it all in stride. Even though five of her six upcoming road races have been canceled, she hasn’t let it impact her training. Her routine is mostly the same, save for trips to the gym.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of online resources,” she said, and she’s using dumbbells and kettlebells at home for strength training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A technology consultant for HM Health Solutions, the 27-year-old prefers a real-time race experience to a virtual one. For now she’s happy to stick with her usual routine of both easy and hard workouts to keep her fitness level up.</p>
<p>“What motivates me is being the strongest and healthiest person I can be,” she says, noting that if the Anchorage Mayor’s Half Marathon goes on in June, she’ll be ready.</p>
<p>Mr. Schooley also is trying to maintain a glass-half-full view.&nbsp;With so many people out walking for exercise, some are bound to start jogging, he said.</p>
<p>“So we might see the third running boom on the other side of this. I hope runners stay engaged.”</p>
