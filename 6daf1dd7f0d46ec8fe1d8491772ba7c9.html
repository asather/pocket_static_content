<h1>People stepping up to support Amish abuse victims</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>LANCASTER — When Miriam Esh learned of a devastating case of child sexual abuse emerging last year in a Lancaster County Amish community, she traveled here from her Lewisburg, Pa., home to offer support to the victims.</p>
<p>As someone who also experienced abuse growing up Amish, she had a concise message for the girls: “I’m coming as a survivor, and I want you to know there’s hope, and there are people who will stand by you.”</p>
<p>It’s that hope that sustains those advocating for victims in Amish, Mennonite and related “Plain” Anabaptist communities.</p>
<p>Several of them traveled here from miles around on Friday to observe the sentencing of David Stoltzfus Smucker to what was effectively a life sentence after his convictions on 20 felony charges of molesting four granddaughters. Their mission is not just to see justice done in individual cases, but to work toward breaking a cycle of sexual abuse that crosses generations.</p>
<p>“It has to stop,” said Joanna Yoder of Mifflinburg. “We have to make that change. We have to be the ones making this change.”</p>
<p>Smucker, 75, was handcuffed and taken in his wheelchair to prison after the Friday hearing in Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas, where he was sentenced to 38 to 76 years in state prison. Several family and community members looked on as Smucker, patriarch of a large family with 65 grandchildren, showed no emotion and offered no statement.</p>
<p>The judge said he gives no discount for age or health in such a case, saying he couldn’t imagine “anything more offensive or evil than the conduct you have perpetrated.”</p>
<p>Those involved say the healing for the girls is beginning but will take a long time. Smucker abused them regularly for years beginning when they were 4 or 5. Now entering their teen years, their caseworker testified at the sentencing that they struggle with what’s known clinically as “sexually reactive” behavior. They have an unwanted compulsion to act out sexually on other children, and are currently housed separately and undergoing therapy.</p>
<p>There is hope for sexually reactive children, said Monica Cohu, a family training specialist at the FosterAdopt Connect Agency in Missouri, which helps youths and families navigate the complex child-welfare system. She is certified in training parents with children or teens who are sexually reactive or sexually aggressive.</p>
<p>“They can heal, but it’s going to take a very long time,” she said. Children in such situations need parents committed to them and to learning the skills to care for them.</p>
<p>Most children who grow up with trauma are “full of developmental gaps,” she said. “They may be 13 chronologically, but they may be 2 emotionally. Trauma affects every part of the brain and every part of development. They have learned to cope with the stress with these behaviors when they feel fearful and out of control.”</p>
<p>Ms. Cohu said hope lies in the fact that teenagers still have a lot of development ahead of them.</p>
<p>For the parents, it can be a lonely process. They might face stigma from outsiders who blame them for their children’s actions, and they might struggle to find specialists who understand their children’s needs.</p>
<p>“It’s very sacred work,” she said. “You’re literally rebuilding a life.”</p>
<p>She added: “If a kid has one adult to commit to them, they can make it. They can heal. We have to keep in mind it wasn’t these kids’ fault.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an increasingly vocal group of advocates, both inside and outside Plain communities, are striving to break such cycles of abuse, which some of those observing Friday’s sentencing knew of from first-hand experience.</p>
<p>The sentencing hearing showed “the reality of the aftermath of abuse in a closed culture,” said Diane Burkholder of Lancaster County, who with her family left the Old Order Mennonite movement and are rebuilding their understandings of healthy sexuality and family relationships.</p>
<p>Saloma Furlong of Virginia who was abused while growing up in an Ohio Amish community and who left the movement when she was a young adult, said that as she observed the court hearing, “I really wondered what had been done to David Smucker” in his own youth.</p>
<p>Victim advocate Audrey Kauffman, of Newburg, Pa., attended the sentencing in part to learn what to expect from upcoming court proceedings for her former husband, who faces multiple criminal charges in Cumberland County of sexually abusing their children. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>“Seeing justice done gives me hope there will be justice for us,” said Ms. Kauffman of her children. She formerly lived in Amish and Mennonite communities.</p>
<p>She said halting the cycles of abuse requires confronting power structures in a patriarchal church culture in which victims often have been shamed.</p>
<p>“It’s going to take a complete rewiring of the culture,” she said.</p>
