<h1>WPIAL boys basketball: Sto-Rox defense clamps down on No. 2 Springdale</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Springdale could have taken a two-game lead and closed in on its first section title since 1993. Sto-Rox had other ideas.</p>
<p>Malik Smith scored a game-high 21 points and the Sto-Rox defense held Class 2A No. 2 Springdale (14-2, 8-1) to 17 points below its season average and to its lowest output of the season as the Vikings (9-6, 8-1) moved into a tie for first place with the Dynamos in Section 1 with a 72-49 home victory.</p>
<p>Sto-Rox has now won six in a row and avenged an earlier 86-85 loss to Springdale in the process.</p>
<p>Demitri Fritch led Springdale with 17 points.</p>
