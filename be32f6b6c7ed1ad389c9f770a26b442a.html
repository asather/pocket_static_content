<h1>Broadway extends shutdown through Sept. 6; fate of PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh unclear</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Broadway will not be back before Sept. 6, the third extension of its closing due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>When the Great White Way shuttered on March 13, the Broadway League initially said the shows would not go on through April 12. The closing was later extended through June 7 before the most recent announcement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>New York City has been the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. As of today, 21,640 people have died in New York state of the coronavirus, although the curve for new cases and deaths has recently been on a downturn.</p>
<p>Sixteen shows never saw opening night when Broadway — and theaters nationwide — closed their doors on or near March 12. In New York alone, it is estimated that theater closings have put 96,000 people out of work.</p>
<p>The Broadway League announcement did not address touring Broadway shows. In Pittsburgh, a tour of “Ain’t Too Proud,” the Broadway hit about Motown’s Temptations, is scheduled to open the PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh series at the Benedum Center, opening on Aug. 25.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is expected to address Broadway’s decision later in the week, but the Pittsburgh dates are not listed on <a href="https://www.ainttooproudmusical.com/" target="_blank">the official tour site</a>. Pittsburgh is still listed as the third stop on the<a href="https://www.hadestown.com/tour.php#subscribe" target="_blank">&nbsp;“Hadestown” tour site</a>, due here on Oct. 27.</p>
