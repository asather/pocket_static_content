<h1>Local Scene: Pittsburgh Women's Music Festival launches and new music by Central Plains, Joy Toujours and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The inaugural​ Pittsburgh Women’s Music Festival​ was supposed to happen at Mr. Smalls Theatre and Funhouse in Millvale on March 28, which was about two weeks after the pandemic shut live music down.</p>
<p>The live festival, created by Liz Berlin (of Rusted Root, Mr. Smalls and Creative.Life.Support) with Deb Cook and Steel Kitty Productions, has been pushed to next year, but a virtual version, dubbed the Pittsburgh Women’s Festival: A Parallel Universe Livestream Event, will take place Saturday from 5 to 11 p.m.</p>
<p>Rather than just round up the usual suspects, Berlin and Cook did a call for submissions to uncover new talent.</p>
<p>“We wanted to put it out there for everybody in the city,” Berlin says.&nbsp;“We wanted to get the word out as much as possible. We could have just asked all the people we know, and there’s plenty of them to put a huge lineup together, but I think we ended up with such amazing diversity and a lot of artists I’ve never heard of before applied.”</p>
<p>It will feature a range from folk to rock to hip-hop to Indian classical with performances by Berlin, Brittney Chantele, Kelly Zullo, Jess Klein, HollyHood, Skye, Barbara Anndrea Arriaga, Kalawati-Carmen, Leila Rhodes, Anne Eliza, Cherylann Hawk, Leah Stevens, Lauren Judson, Julianne Wright, Carrie Collins, Sarah Halter, Special K, Katya, Rocket Loves Blue, Maleena, Sarah Halter, Gabriella Salvucci and Hemlock For Socrates.</p>
<p>There will also be a premiere of a music video for “#BigBrotherIsTrending!,” from Social Justice Disco, the group fronted by Berlin and Phat Man Dee.</p>
<p>The festival will highlight the artwork of Tonee Turner, a 22-year-old Pittsburgh artist who has been missing since Dec. 30. Turner, who taught at the Braddock Carnegie Library ceramic studio, worked in the mediums of illustration, paint, wire wrapping jewelry, metal, skateboard repair and design, ceramics and dance.</p>
<p>The festival organizers note in a press release, “According to a 2018 Pitchfork article, ​7 out of 10 artists on music festival stages are men.*​ In A Parallel Universe, there is a world where female visual artists are lauded and showcased prominently everywhere from coffee shops to museum walls.”</p>
<p>A tip jar will be provided for each artist to show support for them or the charity of their choice.</p>
<p><strong>On the Central Plains&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Nik Westman, who was part of the Pittsburgh scene for a decade before taking his Central Plains project to Brooklyn in 2011, has had a productive pandemic.</p>
<p>The indie-rock artist recorded guitar and vocals for the new EP <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6u0opZEkY1v8EilyVM1aih" target="_blank">“nimble minds”</a> in his apartment using Logic Pro and emailed the files to Sacramento where Matthew Kramer added bass and drums. From there, they went to Jon Miller of Pittsburgh’s Ice House Recordings, who did the final mixing and mastering.</p>
<p>Westman opens the EP with “walls,” a Southern gothic-flavored song on which he sings in a hazy drone, “We’re in this country that’s torn.” “nimble minds” continues in a dreamy psych-folk vein that brings to mind Kurt Vile and the Violators.</p>
<p>One of the songs, “Hole in My Head,” appears on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-508047858-858428814?fbclid=IwAR3GeVhdO_i9jRibwKX6qVassN9BowrCL2exDrzCuLdhiVe7Ue1OM3TvEf8" target="_blank">“Songs in Place: The Corona Tapes,”</a> Westman’s mixtape compilation of other artists from around the country and the world who have been working at home.</p>
<p>Westman says that writing and recording during the pandemic, “inspired me to reach out to all my music friends to see if they had anything that they wanted to share. It didn't take long until mp3s and Wav files started popping up in my inbox. So I just listened to all the songs and had to do a bit of ‘mastering’ to get the tracks at a consistent volume. I originally planned on putting them out via Spotify and Apple music but my subscription did not ‘support’ various artists so I just went [with] soundcloud. I'm feeling really pumped about cranking out content and getting all my shy talented musician friends to just put [stuff] out because it doesn't seem like there's ever a right time for relatively unknown artists to release stuff.”</p>
<p>Among those are Jahnke, The Happy Cowboys, Ben Schapiro, Emily Frembgen, David Bernabo and Mystic Seers, who contribute “Tired of Staying Home.”</p>
<p><strong>Rolling with Joy Toujours&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Joy Toujours calls the video for the new song “Giving Tree” “an intimate look into my less than binary viewpoints.”</p>
<p>It finds the Pittsburgh-based “experimental post folk” artist, in a half-dress/half-suit combo, blissfully skating under the disco ball at Belvedere’s in a purple haze while the song declares “The things I used to do for you/I now just do for me/Life is so much better now/I’m not a giving tree.”</p>

<p>Toujours, who has been running the Lawrenceville nightclub for the last 15 years, plans to leave Pittsburgh soon to focus on music, made in the wondrous vein of Magnetic Fields.</p>
<p>“I’m moving into a van,” Toujours says. “I’ve been outfitting it with a sink and toilet the past couple weeks. Thinking Nashville first, but I want to travel…”</p>
<p><strong>Live music returns</strong></p>
<p>With Lawrence County going green on Friday, there will be live music at the Koehler Brewery Pub, which has been closed since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>The Ellwood City brewery will present the classic-rock duo The Leftovers Band at 7 p.m. Friday and the Big Sewickley Band at 7:30 p.m. Saturday.</p>
<p>The club is allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity.</p>
<p>“Giving Tree” will appear on a forthcoming EP, delayed because of COVID-19, that also includes a cover of Cher’s “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down.”</p>
<p><strong>Clegg from home</strong></p>
<p>Clinton Clegg, the powerful singer who fronts soul-rock band The Commonheart, is teaming with Primanti Brothers and WDVE to do a concert from his home at 5 p.m. Friday to support Magee-Women’s Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman’s&nbsp;‘Highway’</strong></p>
<p>Ryan Hoffman is working on the full-length followup to “The Pines,” his impressive 2018 debut with The Pioneers.</p>
<p>The indie-folk singer-songwriter offers a good first taste with “Highway,” a single landing on Spotify this week.</p>
