<h1>State backs #ProtectYourBrain campaign and other campus anti-opioid efforts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Students at a campus in a county pounded by the opioid epidemic will soon start seeing, over and over again, a social-media-friendly message: #ProtectYourBrain.</p>
<p>Sometimes used in reference to sports-related concussions, the hashtag will now be an important part of an anti-drug-abuse push at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, recipient Wednesday of one of 13 state grants for opioid prevention programs at post-secondary institutions.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t say, ‘Don’t do opioids.’ It’s not a don’t-do message,” said Erick Lauber, director of community health and leadership at IUP’s Mid-Atlantic Research and Training Institute for Community and Behavioral Health. Negative messages don’t work well, he said. “It’s a think-long-term-and-protect-your-brain message.”</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf’s office and the state Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs announced the prevention grants to colleges and universities, totaling nearly $1 million. No school got more than $100,000, and IUP received $99,889.</p>
<p>Robert Morris University received $83,979, and Duquesne University $78,305. The other 10 recipients are in other regions of the state.</p>
<p>The money can be used for existing or new efforts to improve awareness on campus of the dangers of opioids, reduce the stigma surrounding use, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/01/02/Narcan-naloxone-Allegheny-County-pharmacists-reimbursement-Pennsylvania-Commission-Crime-Delinquency-UPMC/stories/201912300099" target="_blank">train people to use the overdose-reversing drug naloxone</a> (including the brand name Narcan), and help people to grieve.</p>
<p>The funding comes from a $55.9 million grant given to the state by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to address the prescription opioid, heroin and fentanyl epidemic that drove fatal overdoses to record highs in 2017.</p>
<p>“Educating college students on the risk of opioid use and training institutions of higher learning on how to administer naloxone are two ways we can save lives and lessen the impact of this crisis," Mr. Wolf said in a press release announcing the grants.</p>
<p>The effort comes as a growing number of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2018/04/21/alcohol-substance-opioids-college-west-virginia-university-penn-state-wvu-recovery-higher-education/stories/201804190194" target="_blank">post-secondary schools have begun to help students in recovery</a>, and in some cases to involve themselves in community efforts to address addiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Indiana County, with a population of 84,000, drug deaths peaked at 53 in 2016, dropped steadily to 23 in 2018, but rebounded to at least 36 last year. On a per capita basis, those rates are similar to Allegheny County's.</p>
<p>“Devastating would be a good word,” said Mr. Lauber, who has worked at IUP for more than 15 years. While opioid abuse is not especially prevalent on campuses, he said, “We have had people suffer from this. We also have students from families who have suffered from this.”</p>
<p>He co-led research, released this week, built on interviews with 50 drug users and 50 professionals who work to address addiction, all in Armstrong, Blair, Cambria and Indiana counties. Among other things, the research raised concern that narrow focus on opioids would miss new trends — from vaping to a methamphetamine surge to the combining of multiple drugs — that demand vigilance.</p>
<p>Thus IUP’s new, state-funded awareness campaign will be broad in scope. “We’re trying to show what it looks like to have a healthy lifestyle and a healthy brain,” said Mr. Lauber. The message will go out via the student-run newspaper, TV and radio stations, and social media.</p>
<p>The school will also bring in certified family recovery specialists who can talk with students whose loved ones are in addiction, and potentially guide them to help.</p>
<p>Robert Morris is still planning its use of the state grant funds, but expects the program to include an awareness campaign, plus opioid abuse prevention training and education to faculty, staff, and students, according to Jonathan Potts, a spokesman for the university.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs, Duquesne’s grant application focused on expanding its existing educational and referral programs for people at risk of addiction.</p>
<p>The grants reflect the department’s increased focus on drug abuse prevention, treatment and recovery, as well as reducing the stigma that often deters people from seeking help.</p>
<p>Highmark last year surveyed members and found that in the Pittsburgh market area, 86% of respondents believed that opioid addiction or dependence was at least somewhat the fault of the user. The health insurer's president Deb Rice-Johnson said in a release this week that opioid use disorder should be "viewed as a chronic disease, rather than a moral failing."</p>
<p><a href="https://justfive.org/highmarkblueshield/" target="_blank">The insurer is offering members short educational modules</a> created by the national addiction education nonprofit Shatterproof.</p>
<p>While drug deaths are down, the overall societal damage from the opioid epidemic continues to be formidable. The <a href="https://data.pa.gov/stories/s/9q45-nckt/" target="_blank">state recently posted online county-by-county estimates</a> of the annual lost wages related to opioid use, putting it at $335 million in Allegheny County and $24 million in Indiana County.</p>
