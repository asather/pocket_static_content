<h1>'Football will always be here for me': Ryan Shazier steps away from the game</h1>

<p><em><strong>This is a developing story and will be updated:</strong></em></p>
<p>“Superman” is putting away his cape.</p>
<p>In an emotional video Wednesday morning on Twitter, former Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier essentially announced his retirement from the NFL. Shazier was placed on the reserve/retired list by the team in March but has been on an inspirational journey attempting to come back from a life-threatening back injury sustained on the field in 2017.</p>
<p>“When you play the game of football the way I did, you convince yourself you’re Superman, that nothing can stop you,” Shazier said. “But then the moment I got hurt, I stopped being Superman, and that was difficult to make sense.”</p>
<p>Making a tackle in a Monday night game against the Bengals, Shazier damaged his spine and needed corrective surgery. Nonetheless, he has recovered to the point of being able to walk and work out, even serving as an unofficial member of the Steelers coaching and scouting staff since his injury.</p>
<p>Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert has maintained that Shazier will always be part of the team. Three days after his 28th birthday, Shazier is looking to the future.</p>
<p>“I’m going to step away from the game for a while and see what else life has to offer,” he said, later thanking his wife, Michelle, and two children. “I know football will always be here for me if I need it, but right now, I’m excited to explore some new challenges and different paths.”</p>
<p>Shazier is expected to address local media members Wednesday afternoon.</p>
