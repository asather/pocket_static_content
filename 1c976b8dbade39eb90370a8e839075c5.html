<h1>DA: Judge of elections in Lehigh County charged in darkening of ballot choices</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A judge of elections in an Allentown, Pa., ward is facing criminal charges for allegedly “assisting” voters by darkening the bubbles already filled out on about 30 ballots in this year’s primary election.</p>
<p>Erika Bickford, also known as Everett Edward Bickford and the Rev. Everett E. Bickford, has served as the elected judge of elections in the 3rd Ward of Allentown for at least the past ten years.</p>
<p>She was charged Monday with insertion and alteration of entries in documents and prying into ballots, both misdemeanors, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said.</p>
<p>Bickford voluntarily surrendered to detectives on Monday, was arraigned and released on her own recognizance, Martin said.</p>
<p>At issue are ballots in Allentown’s 3rd Ward and the contested Democratic primary between Peter Schweyer and Enid Santiago for Pennsylvania House of Representatives 22nd Legislative District, which covers part of Allentown.</p>
<p>Bickford is not accused of altering or changing a vote to favor one of the candidates, but “it appears clear beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Bickford ‘colored in’ or ‘darkened’ marks or ‘bubbles’ on the ballots of about thirty voters,” Martin said.</p>
<p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the primary election was postponed until June 2 this year.</p>
<p>The 3rd Ward’s poll that day was at the Lehigh County Government Center at 17 S. 7th St., and Santiago received 95 votes and Schweyer received 52 votes there, the district attorney said.</p>
<p>The certified election results had Schweyer winning with 2,197 votes over Santiago’s 2,142, a difference of 55 votes.</p>
<p>After the primary, Santiago filed a complaint alleging voter suppression and intimidation, and requested a special election to fill the seat. Part of her complaint was alleged irregularities at the 3rd Ward poll.</p>
<p>A public hearing was held July 29 before the Lehigh County Board of Elections to address Santiago’s allegations. The board found allegations of Bickford’s conduct during the primary merited being referred to the district attorney’s office and state attorney general’s office for investigation.</p>
<p>The board did not identify the specific actions of Everett Bickford which were found to be “suspicious,” Martin said.</p>
<p>Santigo told county investigators that while inside the poll at the government center, she noticed that Bickford had two ballots in her hand, one apparently voted ballot and one blank ballot. Santiago alleges she saw Bickford writing on a blank ballot.</p>
<p>Lehigh County Chief Clerk for Registrations and Elections Tim Benyo was present at the time, Martin said, Benyo reportedly admonished Bickford and told her that she had to stop and that her actions were not permissible.</p>
<p>Benyo testified he questioned Bickford, and she reportedly said she was “darkening the bubbles” because the machine couldn’t read them. Benyo stated he told Bickford to stop, that she couldn’t do that. Benyo asked Bickford where the voter was, and Bickford said that the voter had left or that she didn’t know, according to the hearing testimony.</p>
<p>Bickford testified she assisted approximately ten voters by darkening the bubbles on their ballots so that the machine could read the ballot and that she “trimmed” 10 or 20 ballots so that the machine would accept them.</p>
<p>In an interview with detectives, Bickford said that she altered no ballots, but that she darkened the dots that the voter chose.</p>
<p>When asked how many ballots she thought she darkened, Bickford reportedly said “not many, about thirty, maybe if that.”</p>
<p>The detectives examined all of the ballots from the 3rd Ward and found no evidence of tampering on the ballot; no indications of a double vote in any of the races listed on the ballot; and no “spoiled” ballots in the 3rd Ward.</p>
