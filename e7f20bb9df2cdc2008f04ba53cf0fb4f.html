<h1>Have a sparkling and fiery Fourth, even without the fireworks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s a bummer, isn’t it, that this year there will be no fireworks on July Fourth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s annual dazzling aerial show, along with the ones staged in dozens of community ballfields and municipal parks throughout the region, which are an honored tradition if not almost a religion, have been canceled.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;just because this year’s fireworks display will be limited to the sparklers and cherry bombs that you can buy at Target instead of the Zambelli pyrotechnics launched from a barge between the West End Bridge and Heinz Field, it doesn’t mean your Fourth of July celebration should not elicit oohs and aahs.</p>
<p>With a few bright and fiery choices, it’s easy to make your Independence Day picnic or barbecue spread sparkle <em>almost</em> as much as those brilliant and&nbsp;colorful aerial repeaters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every summer celebration should kick off with a great cocktail. Gin is often a first choice for the base because it’s light and wonderfully botanical, and it lends itself to any number of refreshing punches, gimlets, martinis and other mixed drinks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The folks manning the bar at Federal Galley, a food hall on the North Side, suggest mixing the clear spirit in a cocktail shaker with a bit of dry vermouth, a splash of the black raspberry liqueur, Chambord, simple syrup, and some fresh lemon or lime juice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They call it the River Sipper, and it’s exactly that — an easy-sipping daytime drink that will put everyone in a buoyant mood. The citrus makes it extra refreshing on a warm summer day, and the light blush hue from the raspberries adds a dash of color without being overly girly. It comes together in less than a minute and goes down almost — almost —&nbsp;as fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth of July parties also invariably include some type of potato on the picnic table, most notably a mayonnaise- or mustard-based salad.</p>
<p>This year, why not go for spuds that are a little more explosive and full of flavor? I like to toss cubed baby or fingerling potatoes in a little bit of olive oil with coarse salt, garlic and red pepper flakes and then roast them in a super-hot oven until crispy.</p>
<p>When ready to serve, I panfry the potatoes in a little more oil with even more red pepper flakes, and then drizzle them with a spicy, smoky salsa brava, which also can be used for dipping. It’s a take on the popular Spanish appetizer,&nbsp;<em>patatas bravas</em>, and it pairs just as well with pork as it does chicken, steak or hamburgers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the main dish, of course we go with the perennial holiday favorite of barbecued ribs.</p>
<p>Baby back pork ribs, in particular, made all the easier because they are roasted in the oven and finished (only if you want the extra step) on the grill. Here again we go for the fireworks, preparing the ribs with a chili-based rub and a fiery, spicy-sweet sauce made with habanero peppers.</p>
<p>They might not literally cause an explosion, but they are certain to turn up the heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>River Sipper</strong></p>
<p><em>PG tested</em></p>
<p>Herbal and refreshing, gin is a perfect spirit for summertime cocktails. This citrusy gin cocktail created by the bar staff at Federal Galley not only will help your guests beat the heat but also will create some sparkle with its pretty, pale-pink tint and bright lemon garnish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You probably might be celebrating the holiday in your backyard or on someone’s porch, but&nbsp;“imagine you are on a boat on a hot Fourth of July night watching the fireworks above you,” says bartender DJ Hitchman.&nbsp;“This is what I would want to drink — refreshing, easy to drink and versatile.”</p>
<p>It can be served straight up or over rocks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10½ ounces (about 1¼ cups) Citadelle gin (or any other botanical gin)</p>
<p>3 ounces Noilly Prat (or any other dry vermouth)</p>
<p>3 ounces fresh lemon or lime juice</p>
<p>1½ ounces Chambord (raspberry liqueur)</p>
<p>1½ ounces simple syrup</p>
<p>Prosecco or&nbsp; Champagne for topping off</p>
<p>Fresh lemon peel for garnish</p>
<p><strong>Combine</strong> all ingredients except Prosecco or Champagne into a large cocktail shaker with ice.</p>
<p><strong>Shake</strong> aggressively until the tin gets frosty to properly dilute the drink. If you don’t have a large enough cocktail shaker, combine the cocktail ingredients in a large Mason jar and shake in batches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strain</strong> into your favorite glass, either straight up or on the rocks. (You’ll need 6 glasses.)</p>
<p><strong> Using</strong> your thumb and forefinger of each hand, twist lemon peel over the glass, peel side down, to release the citrus oil onto the surface of the drink.</p>
<p><strong>Rub</strong> the peel around the rim of the glass to provide a little extra flavor. Top with a splash of Prosecco or Champagne and serve.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Makes</strong> 6 cocktails.</p>

<p><strong>Boom Boom Potatoes</strong></p>
<p><em>PG tested</em></p>
<p>Every July Fourth cookout includes potato salad. This dish forgoes the mayonnaise for a spicy sauce made with two kinds of paprika, garlic and onion in a take on the iconic Spanish tapas known as patatas bravas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I roasted the potatoes beforehand, then panfried them just before serving in vegetable oil to make them extra crispy. Drizzle the sauce on top or serve in a bowl for dipping.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For potatoes</strong></p>
<p>2 pounds small potatoes, baby Yukon gold, fingerling or red skin potatoes</p>
<p>2 cloves garlic, cracked away from skin</p>
<p>2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, enough to just coat potatoes</p>
<p>Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p>
<p>Generous pinch or two of crushed red pepper flakes</p>
<p><strong>For sauce</strong></p>
<p>⅓ cup of olive oil</p>
<p>½&nbsp;small yellow onion, minced</p>
<p>2 cloves garlic, minced</p>
<p>1 bay leaf</p>
<p>Pinch of sugar</p>
<p>1 tablespoon hot smoked paprika</p>
<p>1 tablespoon&nbsp; sweet smoked paprika</p>
<p>1 tablespoon flour or cornstarch&nbsp;</p>
<p>1½ cups of water, chicken or vegetable broth</p>
<p>Sherry vinegar, optional</p>
<p>Salt to taste</p>
<p><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 450 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>Scrub</strong> potatoes clean then cut in half or quarters (depending on size) and place on a cookie sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> cracked cloves of garlic. Coat potatoes and garlic with oil and season generously with salt, pepper and crushed red pepper flakes.</p>
<p><strong>Place</strong> potatoes on center rack of oven and roast 20 minutes until just tender</p>
<p><strong>For sauce:</strong>&nbsp;Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, and cook until translucent. Add bay leaf, sugar and paprikas, and stir until combined. Add flour or cornstarch and stir until combined.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> water or broth very gradually, stirring constantly. You may have to add more flour or cornstarch to achieve the desired right consistency, which needs to be velvety and smooth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reduce</strong> heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt to taste. Remove the bay leaf and then puree in a blender and pour into a glass jar. If desired, brighten the sauce with a splash of sherry vinegar.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When</strong> ready to serve, drizzle sauce over the warm roasted potatoes. For extra crunch and spice, panfry the potatoes in vegetable oil with a pinch or two of red pepper flakes just before serving.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Serves</strong> 4 to 6.</p>

<p><strong>Baked Firecracker Baby Back Ribs</strong></p>
<p><em>PG tested</em></p>
<p>This is perfect for family gatherings because most of the work is done before anyone arrives; the ribs are baked low and slow in the oven.</p>
<p>You can, however, finish the ribs on the grill if you want a smokier taste. After removing ribs from oven, spread the sauce all over both sides of the ribs. Grill on rack over medium heat for 15 minutes, brushing with additional sauce every 5 minutes, turning once. Adjust heat as necessary to prevent burning.&nbsp;For less heat, substitute jalapeno peppers for the habaneros.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 racks baby back pork ribs, about 2 pounds each, excess fat removed</p>
<p><strong>For rub</strong></p>
<p>1 cup brown sugar</p>
<p>½ cup white sugar</p>
<p>½ cup salt</p>
<p>2 tablespoons cayenne</p>
<p>1 tablespoon ancho chili powder</p>
<p>1 tablespoon chili pepper flakes</p>
<p><strong>For firecracker sauce</strong></p>
<p>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</p>
<p>½ onion, diced</p>
<p>3 cloves garlic, minced</p>
<p>2 cups apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>2 habanero peppers, minced</p>
<p>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</p>
<p>1 cup brown sugar</p>
<p>¼&nbsp;cup ketchup</p>
<p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p><strong>Prep</strong> ribs by removing the tough silver membrane on the back of the meat. Preheat oven to 300 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>For rub, </strong>combine sugars and spices in a small bowl. Place ribs on foil-covered baking sheet, sprinkle a generous amount of dry rub all over the ribs (both sides) and rub it in. Tightly wrap ribs in foil, and bake for 2½ hours or until very tender but not falling apart.</p>
<p><strong>While</strong> ribs are baking, prepare sauce: Heat oil in large pan, add onion and garlic and saute until soft, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Add</strong> vinegar and minced habaneros and bring to boil. When at rolling boil, add cayenne, brown sugar, ketchup and salt, and stir to combine. Cook sauce over medium heat until it's reduced to sauce-like consistency, about 30 minutes. Keep warm.</p>
<p><strong>After</strong> ribs are done cooking, remove ribs from foil and increase oven temperature to 400 degree. Brush ribs with sauce and place back in oven for one more hour, brushing the meat with sauce every 15 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Let</strong> ribs rest 5 minutes, then cut rack into individual rib segments and serve with more barbecue sauce, coleslaw and plenty of napkins.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Serves</strong> 3 to 4.</p>
