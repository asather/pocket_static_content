<h1>Letters from Pirates camp: The biggest lesson learned this week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Five years ago, David Koven started to ask himself a question. Koven was in his mid-40s. He was a husband and a father and had carved out a successful career as a dentist, but the monotony of every-day life got to Koven, a Toronto native who also happened to be the only Canadian at Pirates Fantasy Camp.</p>
<p>Koven wasn’t miserable with his life or anything like that, but he did know that something was missing.</p>
<p>“I just hit this spot where it felt like someone sucked the fun out of everything,” Koven said. “You have your responsibilities — your kids, your work, your bills, blah, blah, blah. And you’re like, ‘Is this it? Do I just keep doing this until I die? Because this isn’t fun.’</p>
<p>“Then I came down here, and it just started this cycle.”</p>
<p>After a week at Pirates Fantasy Camp, I know exactly what Koven means. It’s a good cycle, one that has used baseball to fill a certain void in our lives, and I’m guessing we’re not alone.</p>
<p>I could sit here and write about the food and facilities at this thing, and that would be fine. Both are top-notch, as I learned Friday when we bussed to Sarasota to play the Orioles’ fantasy campers. Community fields and a cramped cafeteria serving bad food only reinforced what I already knew: The Pirates’ version of this camp is run tremendously well.</p>
<p>But it’s not just about that. My week wasn’t just about listening to Steve Blass fine campers random amounts for the stupid stuff they did or didn’t do the day before. It wasn’t about meeting the other former pros, either, although that was certainly neat.</p>
<p>What I’ll take from this experience runs deeper. As I discussed with Koven Friday after our camp-closing banquet — leave it to the former hockey writer to befriend the Canadian guy — I think we all need some form of this in our lives.</p>
<p>From the time we’re little, we do things in groups. We work together toward a common goal and emphasize having fun. We meet people. We get to know one another and hopefully understand our similarities and differences. We learn to work through struggles. Not just in sports, either.</p>
<p>But as we get older and grow busier, we forget about this stuff. We act like it’s not a huge part of our lives when it has been the entire time. In that sense, Pirates Fantasy Camp is selling the live-like-a-major-leaguer stuff to campers, but it’s also offering a trip back to simpler days, when many of us used street lights as a curfew, drank from hoses and actually used our phones to call people, instead of texting.</p>
<p>I realized this while staring at the 8-by-10-inch team photo I received on Friday at the banquet, an image I can’t wait to frame and hang somewhere in our house. I’m proud to be in that photo. I’m proud to have spent the week with those guys, and I’m proud that I can tell you about them — who they are, what they do and how we improved with each game.</p>
<p>It was the most fun I’ve had playing baseball since … well, maybe ever, simply because I needed it so much, even though I didn’t realize I needed it until now.</p>
<p>Similar to most, my childhood friends have all moved on. One is military and lives in Hawaii with his wife and two kids. Another lives here but works all the time. He, too, has kids. A third is in Raleigh, N.C., where he and his wife recently had twins. There’s really only one person I played baseball with that I see for any length of time, and that’s usually at Penguins games, when both of us are working.</p>
<p>Pirates Fantasy Camp filled that void. Here, I found some of the best people I’ve ever met — baseball-loving, newspaper-reading sports nuts who are all unbelievably accepting and welcoming.</p>
<p>Mix it together, and you get a tremendous atmosphere at camp, one filled with sustaining friendships and a group of people who can’t wait until the next time they see one another. That was the cycle Koven mentioned.</p>
<p>“This brought my spirits way up,” Koven said. “I think about [fantasy camp] a lot. And it’s crazy if you don’t get it. If you don’t get it, it sounds nuts, right? My wife calls it ‘Nerd Camp.’ I’m like, ‘These guys are not nerds. They’re great guys.’ ”</p>
<p>Great guys I plan to stay in touch with, too. There’s a camp reunion the second week of May, and I wouldn’t miss it for the world. I honestly got a little emotional Friday leaving Pirate City, knowing it might be tough to do this again. And even if I can pull it off, it’ll never be as special as the first one.</p>
<p>Coming to Pirates Fantasy Camp did indeed produce a series of stories about a fantasy. Just not necessarily the one I imagined.</p>
<p>“Here’s what you can write,” Koven said. “Seven days ago, you didn’t know any of these people. Now, you can tell a story about each one of these guys. How cool is that?”</p>
