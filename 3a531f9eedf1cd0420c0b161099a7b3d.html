<h1>Feds seize money in fraud investigation of Texas charity providing meals for low-income children</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Federal prosecutors in Pittsburgh have moved to forfeit more than $100,000 as part of an investigation of a Texas charity accused of ripping off the federal food program for poor children in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In a forfeiture action to permanently seize $101,510 from a bank account, the U.S. attorney's office said that the money represents proceeds of a scheme by HOIN Inc., to defraud two feeding programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and administered by the state Department of Education.</p>
<p>HOIN is a Dallas non-profit incorporated in Texas in 2014 that received millions from two programs for low-income children to receive meals during the summer when school is out. Its director is listed in public records as Paige Jackson. No contact information was available for the entity and it's not clear from court records where HOIN operated in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that beginning in 2015 and continuing until May 2019, HOIN and its controllers defrauded the Department of Education by lying about its services and meals and submitting false documents so that it could receive reimbursement from the Summer Food Service Program and the Child and Adult Care Feeding Program.</p>
<p>Both are funded by the USDA.</p>
<p>The company received a total of $4 million.&nbsp;But at least some of it was illegally obtained, according to USDA agents.</p>
<p>Nonprofits and for-profit organizations participate as providers for the Child and Adult Care Feeding Program if they meet certain requirements. The Summer Food Service Program is open only to nonprofits.</p>
<p>The organizations set up operations in churches, recreation centers, schools and public housing facilities to provide the meals and then submit claims for reimbursement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prosecutors said HOIN falsely certified in its applications that none of its principals had been declared ineligible to participate in feeding programs, falsely inflated the number of meals it served at its sites, served meals that didn't contain all the necessary food and beverage items, submitted claims for sites where HOIN didn't serve any meals at all and fabricated invoices and purchase records to satisfy program auditors.</p>
<p>HOIN's principals "transferred tens of thousands of dollars out of the bank accounts where HOIN received [Department of Education] reimbursements for their personal benefit," prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The $101,000 was seized on May 28, 2019, from an account at Regions Bank.</p>
