<h1>Wilkinsburg jury asks judge: Who does DA allege held which weapon?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The jury deliberating in the Wilkinsburg mass shooting trial asked the judge two questions Tuesday afternoon:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;“Who does the prosecution allege held .40 caliber and rifle?”</p>
<p>●&nbsp;“Can we get copies of T-Mobile phone records and a Highlighter?”</p>
<p>Cheron Shelton, 33, of Lincoln-Lemington is charged with killing five adults and an unborn child on March 9, 2016, during an ambush of a backyard barbecue at 1304 Franklin Ave.</p>
<p>Investigators believe that Shelton was standing in a side alley firing a 7.62-caliber assault-style rifle through a fence as a co-conspirator firing a .40-caliber handgun herded people toward the house from the backyard. Ammunition that matched the caliber, but not from the same manufacturer, was found in the Homewood townhouse of Shelton’s mother.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/02/11/exhibits-evidence-heard-seen-jury-Wilkinsburg-mass-shooting-trial-deliberations/stories/202002110096" target="_blank">The jury</a> sent the two written questions to Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski shortly before 1:30 p.m. They had been deliberating since 9 a.m. after testimony and closing arguments ended late Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Judge Borkowski ordered the phone records to be provided to the jury. Upon request from Shelton’s lawyer, Randall McKinney, the judge agreed to provide full, rather than edited, versions of the records.</p>
<p>Communications between cell phones said to belong to Shelton and his former co-defendant, Robert Thomas, played a major role in the prosecution’s circumstantial case. Investigators believe that the two were in touch with one another shortly before and just after the shootings, but not when the murders occurred, around 10:53 p.m. An expert on cell phone towers placed the phones in the general vicinity of the shootings at the time of the attack.</p>
<p>As to who prosecutors allege held which gun, the judge told the jury,&nbsp;“That’s a question of fact that you must resolve from the evidence presented, the lack of evidence presented, the law I’ve instructed you on...”</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that Shelton fired 30 shots from a rifle and&nbsp;someone else — investigators believe it was Thomas — fired 18 shots&nbsp;from the handgun.</p>
<p>As the questions were read, Shelton was present in the courtroom along with Mr. McKinney and his co-counsel, Wendy Williams, Deputy District Attorney Kevin Chernosky and Assistant District Attorney Lisa Pellegrini.</p>
<p>The same strict courtroom security protocols that were in place during the trial — spectators had their cell phones secured and were wanded before entering — were underway Tuesday. With more than a dozen spectators (including a partially paralyzed John Ellis Jr., who was wounded in the shooting and uses a wheelchair), the process of filing into the courtroom took about the same amount of time as the brief hearing, if not longer.</p>
<p>Shelton could face the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder.</p>
<p>Investigators allege that he targeted a man at the cookout, Lamont Powell, whom he believed killed his best friend in 2013.</p>
<p>Powell was injured; his brother, Jerry Michael Shelton, his two sisters, Brittany Powell and Chanetta Powell, and his cousins Shada Mahone and Tina Shelton were killed. Ms. Powell was eight months pregnant; her also died.</p>
