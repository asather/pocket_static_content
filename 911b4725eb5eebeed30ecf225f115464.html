<h1>2020 Blue Chip Chat: South Fayette's Naman Alemada</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>NAMAN ALEMADA</strong></p>
<p><strong>School:</strong> South Fayette</p>
<p><strong>Year:</strong> Senior</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> 6-5</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 205</p>
<p><strong>Pos:</strong> QB</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>THE SCOOP</strong></span></p>
<p>Not many WPIAL quarterbacks throw for 3,000 yards and 30 touchdowns in the same season — let alone their first season as a starter — but that’s exactly what Alemada did in 2019, passing for 3,004 yards with 32 touchdowns while leading South Fayette to a 10-2 record. Alemada (6-5, 205) possesses the prototypical size and arm strength to spread the ball around to all areas of the field, and he’s not afraid to stand tall in the pocket and take a hit while making a throw.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>COLLEGE TALK</strong></span></p>
<p>Alemada earned his first Football Bowl Subdivision scholarship offer from Long Island University in the offseason, and is receiving some interest from a few other FBS programs as well, along with several Division II and Division III schools.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>OUR QUESTIONS, HIS ANSWERS</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Are you excited for the challenge of moving up to compete in Class 5A this year?</strong> Yeah, for sure, the 5A [classification] is definitely deep. In order to be the best, you’ve got to beat the best. Peters Township and everyone are top-end teams for sure. So having a chance to play a good opponent week in and week out is exciting, and something we look forward to, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>How many times have you replayed last year’s WPIAL semifinal loss to Belle Vernon in your head? Is it something you tried to bury away in your mind?</strong> It’s definitely something I tried to put away. For a long time I didn’t want to look at the game film. We were up at half, I think, and up going into the fourth quarter, too, and they just found a way to finish. Looking back, there’s a lot of things where I say, ‘I should have made that throw,’ or made this decision, but you can’t dwell on the past. You can’t change the past, so it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your go-to restaurant for a postgame meal after a big win?</strong> Favorite restaurant has to be Pep’s after the game. That’s the spot where everyone goes. The parents meet up and the kids get a booth in the back. That’s definitely the spot after games, Pepperoncini’s Pub.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing you did during the quarantine that you wouldn’t have done otherwise?</strong> I started working out a lot. I think I worked out six hours a day the first three months of quarantine. It wasn’t even heavy intense stuff. It was just a little bit of stretching and yoga, different ways to get my body ready without weights. I even changed up my diet a bit … just taking care of myself, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Do you play fantasy football?</strong> Oh yeah, we just had our fantasy draft last week.</p>
<p><strong>Who was your first-round pick?</strong> I think my first round pick was Saquon Barkley. I got the second overall pick. Of course the guy who ran our league, our league president got [Christian] McCaffery.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever won a fantasy football league before?</strong> I think I won two years ago. I feel pretty good coming into this year, but I grabbed Leonard Fournette in the fourth round, and that was like two days before he got cut … He went from like 20 [projected] points to six points.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>AND FINALLY</strong></span></p>
<p>If there was a WPIAL/City League fantasy football draft, would you deserve consideration for the No. 1 overall pick? I usually don’t pick a quarterback in the first round, so I’m trying to think. I think if it was last year it would have been Ben Jackson. Coming into this year, I don’t know. I’d definitely be up there with Charley [Rossi], Joey [Audia] and Ryan [McGuire] here. I know there’d be a bunch of boys in green and white definitely going early.</p>
