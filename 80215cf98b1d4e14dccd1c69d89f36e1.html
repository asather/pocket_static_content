<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While the city continues to grapple with how to contain the likely spread of COVID-19, leaders took another preventative step on Wednesday by announcing that all business travel for city employees has been suspended effective immediately,&nbsp;according to mayoral spokesman Timothy McNulty.</p>
<p>The emphasis will be on cancelling all business trips that include air travel, he said. The ban does not affect personal vacations.</p>
<p>"I was actually supposed to go to a conference next month, and I won't be doing that," said Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle after council's standing committee meeting.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto was scheduled to land in Pittsburgh at 3 p.m. Wednesday after traveling from Washington, D.C. where he attended a conference with other U.S. mayors.</p>
<p>Mr. McNulty said the office has no immediate concerns about the mayor's travel.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the city also <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/11/Pittsburgh-cancels-St-Patrick-s-Day-parade/stories/202003110107" target="_blank">canceled the St. Patrick’s Day parade</a>, city concerns about COVID-19.</p>
