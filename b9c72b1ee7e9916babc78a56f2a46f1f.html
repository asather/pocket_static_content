<h1>Hittin' the road in an RV is becoming popular again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Retirees Sharon and Dean Walters came to their first RV show at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center on Saturday looking for a motor home in the $100,000 range to put some adventure in their lives.</p>
<p>“We’re thinking of doing this lifestyle in a year or so,” traveling the country with their Great Dane, Mrs. Walters said after touring a one-room Jayco Redhawk with queen bed, dinette, enclosed bathroom and two slide-outs priced at $77,000.</p>
<p>The Marshall Township couple was discussing options, but didn’t plan to make a purchase just yet. “This is a dream day,” Mr. Walters said.</p>
<p>While the Walters’ weren’t ready to buy, the lure of the open road and the smell of new leather was expected to generate more than $3 million in sales over the nine-day show.</p>
<p>Show organizers were projecting a record crowd this year, buoyed by unusually warm weather and the lack of Steelers playoff games, according to Rob Young, who’s been producing the Pittsburgh show since 2007. The previous record, set in 2015, drew more than 30,000 visitors, he said.</p>
<p>The show has been filled to capacity for the last five years, covering nine acres over two floors.</p>
<p>“We would like it to be bigger, but there isn’t any more space,” said Mr. Young of Morgantown, W.Va., who sold his family’s RV dealership about 15 years ago and owns a Winnebago and a vintage Airstream travel trailer with the classic silver exterior that he is restoring.&nbsp;“The show is full and more dealers want in. ...That tells me times must be good” for the industry, he said.</p>
<p>Nationwide, shipments of motor homes and towables through November fell to about 380,000 units, down 17% from the same period in 2018, according to the RV Industry Association. Still, 2019 is expected to be among the best five years in the industry’s history. Currently shipments are more than double the 2009 recession low, said association spokesman Kevin Broom.</p>
<p>Shipments are projected to decline slightly in 2020, but the “long-term outlook is excellent due to the strong appeal of RVs among retiring baby boomers and millennials,” he said.</p>
<p>The most popular price range for a towable travel trailer is $30,000 to $40,000, Mr. Young said. Motor homes, which start at around $70,000 to $80,000, go up to about $500,000 or more, depending on the size and options. Custom coaches can cost $1 million or more.</p>
<p>“When you think about the last 30 years, everything is getting bigger,” Mr. Young said. “Motor homes that typically averaged 24 feet are now probably 34 feet” or more, he said.</p>
<p>While buyers often are retirees who have the freedom to travel, Mr. Young said he’s been seeing more young, childless couples buying motor homes because the Internet gives them the freedom to work while on the road.</p>
<p>Since RVs are really like homes on wheels, they reflect current home decorating trends, although they tend to be a few years behind, he said.</p>
<p>Flatscreen TVs, LED lighting and faux stone accent walls are popular, while the more luxurious models include stainless steel appliances, solid surface countertops, upscale flooring and state-of-the-art navigation, heating and entertainment systems.</p>
<p>Among the larger models at the Pittsburgh show was a big-as-a-bus, 37-foot 2019 Dutch Star motor home with a sticker price of $423,491, selling for $319,880. It included two leather couches, stainless steel appliances, designer faucets, LED touch controls, gas cooktop, central vacuum system and heated, polished ceramic tile flooring. It also sported two slide-outs on both sides, indoor and outdoor flat screen TVs, a diesel and electric hot water and heating system and a 100-gallon gas tank (necessary since it averages just 5 to 7 mpg).</p>
<p>An even bigger 2020 Dutch Star model selling for just under $400,000 included two bathrooms.</p>
<p>“You can have a big party in that one,” one vistor commented. “I don’t see a dishwasher,” said another. “For $400,000, it should have a dishwasher.”</p>
<p>Dishwashers are an option, but typically are small, only handling a setting for four.</p>
<p>Since they don’t have expensive motors, travel trailers can provide lots of space for buyers on a budget.</p>
<p>A 2020 Sunset Trail with a show price of $34,995 included two bathrooms, a master with king bed, a bunk room, couch, dinette, center island kitchen with stainless appliances and an outdoor kitchen.</p>
