<h1>Buying Here: Historic King estate in Highland Park on the market for $3.65 million</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Looking at Baywood, Frank and Maura Brown see 26 years of loving, laborious restoration to bring back the Gilded Age glory of the old King estate at <strong>5501 Elgin St.</strong></p>
<p>Their Highland Park neighbors see a neighborhood landmark, and, when it snows, one of the city’s best sledding hills.</p>
<p>“You can’t park on Elgin Street because of the crowds,” Dr. Brown said, laughing.</p>
<p>The couple made sure the hill remained public property when they bought this 22-room 1880 mansion and 1.8 acres in 1994. Their son, Frank, 28, and daughter, Meredith, 22, grew up here while the Browns and a battalion of artisans and contractors fought inch by inch to rescue the house from time, neglect and decay.</p>
<p>Their children are grown and the end is in sight; the restoration of the last of eight bedrooms is nearly finished. So why are they selling?</p>
<p>“The project is essentially done,” said the retired physician. “It was never about living in a mansion. It was about saving a piece of Pittsburgh's architectural heritage.</p>
<p>“The two of us don’t need 10,000 square feet. We can get lost in here.”</p>
<p>Late last week, they put the property on the market for $3.65 million (MLS No. 1434170) with Mark Jennings of Piatt Sotheby's International Realty (412-321-9999 or <a href="https://www.piattsothebysrealty.com/real-estate/5501-elgin-st-pittsburgh-pa-15206/138284802" target="_blank">www.piattsothebysrealty.com</a>).</p>
<p>Mr. Jennings says it is a privilege to market this piece of Pittsburgh history (<a href="http://www.baywoodmansion.com" target="_blank">www.baywoodmansion.com</a>). When he first toured the house last March, he was wowed “by the scope and scale and attention to detail.”</p>
<p>While gazing into an antique mirror in the parlor called the Gold Room, “I marvel to think who looked in that mirror,” he said.</p>
<p>It was a who’s who of Pittsburgh privilege that began with Alexander King, an Irish immigrant who made his fortune in glass, continued with his daughter, Jennie, and her son, Richard King Mellon, and ended in the 1950s with Robert Burns King, who deeded his family estate to the city in return for not building the Civic Arena here.</p>
<p>City ownership and the next 30 years were not kind to the Second Empire-style mansion with 4½ baths. When the Browns first saw it in 1987, its brick exterior and most walls were painted white and stripped of their architectural bounty. Mr. Brown started buying and storing antique furniture in hopes that he and his wife would be able to buy it.</p>
<p>“It was a little delusional,” Mrs. Brown, a pharmacist, once said.</p>
<p>Now that furniture — including an 1875 Brunswick Monarch pool table, beds that were once owned by Andrew Carnegie and pieces from every important Victorian American cabinet maker — will be part of the sale. Dr. Brown is keeping only two suits of armor and medical instruments, books and other family heirlooms inherited from his father and grandfather, both New Jersey doctors. The collection resides in the library, Dr. Brown’s “most special” room.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/homes/2005/10/01/Highland-Park-mansion-takes-a-bow-on-house-tour/stories/200510010143" target="_blank">He spent hundreds of hours on weekends and vacations carefully stripping white paint</a> from the library’s woodwork and a walnut staircase. Other refinishing was done by George Starz of Starz Interior Restoration, who was joined by woodworkers Wilson &amp; McCracken and&nbsp;Neshannock Woods &amp; Co., paper hanger Ken Kennedy, plasterer Dan McClelland, gilder Joseph Youss Kadri, muralists and restorers Boris Brindar and Celeste Parrendo, and her father, Nick, a stained-glass artist.</p>
<p>General contractor Richard Pelino started the project and after his death, Brian Darrah and Fisher Renovation took over. Mr. Darrah has worked at Baywood for 22 years.</p>
<p>“He’s like part of the family at this point,” Dr. Brown said. “He can do pretty much anything. He knows this house as well as I do.”</p>
<p>The house’s new owners will also receive plans by Strada Architecture for a two-story carriage house that matches Baywood’s architectural details. It’s a chance to leave their own mark on this spectacular piece of Pittsburgh history, and pass it on to others who will be its caretakers for centuries to come.</p>
