<h1>Pitt decides fall classes must stay online through mid-September</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh, where fall classes began Wednesday, has decided to extend online-only instruction beyond this week to Sept. 14 due to COVID-19, a move that comes one day after Carnegie Mellon University said its fall semester would begin for undergraduates online.</p>
<p>“Although I had hoped that after beginning the first week of the semester remotely we would move immediately to mostly in-person classes, we now think it prudent to extend the remote period until Sept. 14,” Provost Ann Cudd told campus in an email Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp;“This adjustment to the schedule will allow for the completion of staged arrival and shelter-in-place procedures so that all students can start in-person classes at the same time.</p>
<p>She said additional information about what in-person classes will take place while Pitt is in the “Elevated Risk posture” would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>Pitt students already have moved into residence halls, off-campus apartments and some $22 million in hotel rooms in Oakland that the university purchased to help reduce occupancy in its campus dorms.</p>
<p>Some 29,000 students attend Pitt’s main campus, and administrators have put in place a system in which the percentage of in-person versus online classes can adjust back and forth during the fall as virus conditions change.</p>
<p>Pitt reported low infection rates based on early testing of students who arrived on campus —&nbsp;less than 1% — but officials, including Dean of Students Kenyon Bonner,&nbsp;<a href="https://mailchi.mp/46300550c605/message-from-dean-bonner-socialize-responsibly-899898" target="_blank">are warning campus</a> that the university’s reopening plans are being jeopardized by large parties reported in the last several days where students were not wearing masks or sitting least six feet apart.</p>
<p>“Let me be clear: Your behavior is threatening a successful fall term for all of us,” he wrote in a campus note Wednesday.</p>
<p>The school, which tweaked its student code of conduct to include pandemic-related health behaviors, said it is prepared to bar offending students from buildings including residence halls, and issue suspensions. Like other schools, Pitt is requiring that face masks be worn on campus and that social distancing rules be followed.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the nation, colleges and universities have been forced to make adjustments, even after students moved in, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where classes as of Wednesday have been moved online. That school reported scores of infections and multiple clusters linked to residences and at least one fraternity house.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. has surpassed 170,000.</p>
<p>Pitt noted the North Carolina situation in its correspondence to students.</p>
<p>“Your actions have consequences,” Mr. Bonner said.</p>
