<h1>Best Pittsburgh concerts this week: Post Malone, Lumineers, Soul Rebels, Wallows and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>MONDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post Malone:</strong> He was in Pittsburgh three years ago to open for Justin Bieber, and now the face-tatted singer born Austin Richard Post comes back a superstar with such hits as “Rockstar,” “Better Now,” “Sunflower” and “Saint Tropez.” Posty, voted “most likely to become famous” in high school, has proven to adept at collaborations, whether it be with rappers like 21 Savage and Future or rockers like Ozzy Osbourne. He was working on something with Mac Miller right before the Pittsburgh rapper died in 2018, so it would be surprising if the occasion passed without a word about his influence and friend. With Swae Lee and Tyla Yaweh at PPG Paints Arena. 8 p.m. Sold out.</p>
<p><strong>The Toasters:</strong> Across the Mon from Post Malone, this New York band that played its first show opening for Bad Brains in 1981 will crowd into Club Cafe, South Side, to celebrate four decades of making third wave ska for the people. The constant has been 60-something British-born frontman Robert “Bucket” Hingley, who came here in the ‘70s and managed the Forbidden Planet comic shop in New York City before forming what would become a Warped Tour attraction. With iNCO FidO and Fubar. 8 p.m. $15; clubcafelive.com.</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lumineers:</strong> The Denver indie/Americana band famed for its hand claps and ho-heys ventured into darker territory on “III,” an album themed to the heartbreak of addiction. It was inspired in part by the brother of percussionist Jeremiah Fraites and close friend to singer Wesley Schultz losing a battle with heroin as a teenager. In light of the material, expect this PPG Paints Arena show to have its emotional and sonic ups and downs. With Mt. Joy and JS Ondara. 7 p.m. $37 and up; ticketmaster.com.</p>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wallows:</strong> The LA indie-rock band, with some throwback New Wave appeal, is fronted by singer-guitarist Dylan Minnette, who starred in the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why.” The trio showed its way with a hook on dreamy debut album “Nothing Happens,” produced by John Congleton (St. Vincent, Alvvays, Future Islands). With Penelope Isles. Mr. Smalls, Millvale. 8 p.m. Sold out.</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Soul Rebels:</strong> Three days after Fat Tuesday, we get the brassy, eight-piece party band that has a weekly gig at the Le Bon Temps Roule in New Orleans. If you watch college basketball, you’ve heard their single “Greatness,” which appears on the Rebels’ seventh album, “Poetry in Motion.” Blending soul, R&amp;B, hip-hop and New Orleans parade music, the group has also toured with the Wu-Tang Clan, opened for The Rolling Stones, collaborated with Katy Perry and Nas, and appeared on NPR's Tiny Desk series. With The Matteson 2. Thunderbird Cafe and Music Hall, Lawrenceville. 8 p.m. $17; roxianlive.com.</p>
<p><strong>Social Justice Disco:</strong> Pittsburgh divas Phat Man Dee and Liz Berlin (of Rusted Root) assemble the gang at Mr. Smalls, Millvale, for another round of SJD, this one with the theme of “Envision a Brighter Future." The playlist will include “I Will Survive” (Gloria Gaynor), “Your Racist Friend” (They Might Be Giants), “Have You Been to Jail For Justice” (Anne Feeney) and “All You Fascists Are Bound To Lose” (Woody Guthrie, Billy Bragg), plus originals like “#BigBrotherIsTrending” and “Jim Crow is Alive and Well.” SJD’s all-star lineup features bassist Patrick Norman, pianist Howard Alexander, guitarist Mark Strickland, flutist-percussionist Miguel Sague II, violinist Megan Williams, drummer Dennis Garner and the Steeltown Horns with Reggie Watkins, Rick Matt and J.D. Chaisson. There will be special sets from Watkins and Friends, Hollyhood, Pastor Deryck Tines &amp; The Lemington Gospel Choir. “The revolution may not be televised,” they note, “but it will have a solid groove!” It begins at 7 p.m. Tickets are $10 advance; $15 at the door; ticketmaster.com.</p>
<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Legendary Album Series:</strong> It went so well the first time, the Rex Theater revisits “O' Brother, Where Art Thou?” for the newest installment of the Legendary Album Series. An ensemble of Pittsburgh musicians will gather to play the Coen brothers’ film soundtrack, a bluegrass/Americana record featuring Ralph Stanley, Alison Krauss, Gillian Welch and others that won the album of the year Grammy in 2002. Performing it will be The Jakobs Ferry Stragglers, Well Strung, Echo Valley, and The Millbillys. 8 p.m. at the South Side venue. Tickets are $17; eventbrite.com.</p>
<p><strong>Starship Mantis:</strong> Never say never, but this could be, as billed, the Final Show on Planet Earth for the cosmic funk band whose members will be scattering around the country in the coming months. They formed at James Street Gastropub and Speakeasy and now go out having blown some minds and rocked some booties over the last three years. They leave behind two albums of adventurous sci-fi funk from the Parliament-Funkadelic school. Spirit, Lawrenceville. 8 p.m. With Clara Kent, Buffalo Rose, hunnycomb, and a late-night dance party with Michael Canton of the Soul Show. There will also be art and light installations by Redfishbowl. $10.69; redfishbowl.com.</p>

<p><strong>RJD2:</strong> The Columbus DJ/producer (born Ramble Jon Krohn) who derived his name from the “Stars Wars” droid, arrives at Mr. Smalls, Millvale, on a tour that precedes his first album in four years, “The Fun Ones.” RJD2’s seventh album, out April 17, will delve into funk and hip-hop with contributions from STS, Khari Mateen, Phonte Coleman, Homeboy Sandman, J-Zone, Kid Koala, Mr. Lif, and Son Little. The follow-up to “Dame Fortune” is advanced with the single, “Pull Up On Love,” Chalk Dinosaur and Buscrates open the show at 8 p.m. Tickets are $20 to $22; ticketweb.com.</p>
<p><strong>Space Jesus:</strong> The bio of Brooklyn-born, Boulder-based Jasha Tull says it all: “Space Jesus explores the electronic auditory universe in search of lower frequencies, future feels, and fire beats.” That exploration will continue at the Roxian, McKees Rocks, on the Moon.Landing Tour. 8 p.m. $25-$40; roxianlive.com.</p>
<p><strong>Brooke Annibale:</strong> While working on the follow-up to 2018’s acclaimed “Hold To the Light,” the acclaimed Pittsburgh singer-songwriter plays a home show on her East Coast and European tour at the Thunderbird Cafe &amp; Music Hall, Lawrenceville, at 8 p.m. With Anna Vogelzang. $15; eventbrite.com.</p>
