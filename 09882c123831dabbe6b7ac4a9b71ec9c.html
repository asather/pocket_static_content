<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was a basketball game with family matters.</p>
<p>Tim McConnell hit a big coaching milestone Monday night. His daughter helped get him there. And his sister ended up on the losing end of the game.</p>
<p>McConnell, the girls basketball coach at Chartiers Valley, got his 600th win when the Colts defeated visiting Trinity, 67-48, in a WPIAL Class 5A Section 1 game.</p>
<p>Tim McConnell coached the Chartiers Valley boys for 25 years and his record of 552-146 was 14th-best in WPIAL history. He took over the Chartiers Valley girls last year and has yet to lose a game in two seasons. He is 48-0 to give him a combined boys and girls record of 600-146, good for a .804 winning percentage.</p>
<p>Megan McConnell, a senior guard and Tim’s daughter, scored a team-high 21 points against Trinity. The first-year coach of Trinity is Kathy McConnell-Miller, who is Tim’s sister.</p>
<p>It was the second time Chartiers Valley (18-0 overall, 11-0 in section) beat Trinity (13-3, 9-2), the Post-Gazette’s No. 3 WPIAL Class 5A team. Chartiers Valley, the No. 1 team, won the first time by only 62-56, and things looked good for Trinity this time when it took a 10-2 lead. But Chartiers Valley came back to go ahead, 30-20,&nbsp;at halftime, and took a 42-31 advantage into the fourth quarter.</p>
