<h1>Oriental Market in Ross hit with consumer alert</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Oriental Market grocery store on McKnight Road in Ross drew a consumer alert from the Allegheny County Health Department for numerous health code violations.</p>
<p>Some of the violations included holding food at unsafe temperatures, problems with cleaning and sanitization, and problems with cross contamination.</p>
<p>“Certified person in charge does not appear to be enforcing basic food safety principles,” according to the inspection report.</p>
<p>The store also was cited for food in unsound condition. “Eight crates of sliced fish sitting directly outdoors [drying] under no protection in parking lot. Flies observed on the fish carcasses,” the inspection report said, noting that it was a repeat violation.&nbsp;“When inspector requested all fish be discarded, operator was hesitant and placed only a portion of fish in the dumpster and concealed rest of the fish from inspectors in the walk-in cooler.”</p>
<p>Manager Cindy Liu said the store will stop drying fish.</p>
<p>The inspection report noted that all employees were wearing face masks as required during the state’s green reopening phase.</p>
