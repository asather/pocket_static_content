<p>Pittsburgh police clarified Tuesday that tear gas was used in addition to smoke canisters to clear protesters in East Liberty on Monday following a march against police brutality.</p>
<p>According to a statement from police spokesman Chris Togneri, smoke canisters were used specifically to disperse a group that had splintered off around 7 p.m. at the intersection of Negley and Centre avenues from the main group, which had been protesting on Penn Avenue and had organized to end at that time.</p>
<p>A press conference was held by Mayor Bill Peduto, police Chief Scott Schubert, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich and other officials outside Pittsburgh police headquarters at 11 p.m. Monday.</p>
<p>Chief Schubert and other officials said that the “splinter group” began throwing rocks, bricks and water bottles at police, which prompted officers to use smoke — not tear gas — to disperse the crowd</p>
<p>However, police said they did use tear gas at other locations in East Liberty following the 7 p.m. incident after additional orders to disperse were issued to clear the streets. Still, an East End resident who spoke on condition of anonymity Tuesday evening said he found a used aerosol-grenade canister outside Szechuan Spice on Centre — a discovery that, he says, is contrary to official statements.</p>
<p>Mr. Togneri said police also used beanbags and sponge rounds Monday as crowd dispersal measures and did not use rubber bullets. He said use of rubber bullets by U.S. law enforcement is rare.</p>
<p>A bean bag round is a small fabric projectile filled with lead pellets. It is usually fired from a 12-gauge shotgun.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;sponge round is a bullet-shaped round with a sponge tip and a plastic body, designed to be shot over long distances, according to an article from the Wisconsin State Journal.</p>
<p>Both projectiles are considered&nbsp;“less lethal” weapons but could be deadly, especially from close range.</p>
<p>Mr. Hissrich said nine officers were injured in the clash at Negley and Centre, but that all have been evaluated and released from the hospital. He added that 20 people were arrested, four of whom are not from Pennsylvania.</p>
