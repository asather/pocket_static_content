<h1>Offensive mismatches, Au'Diese Toney's value and more observations from Pitt's win against North Carolina</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A single second had yet to elapse in Pitt’s game Saturday against North Carolina, but as the two teams took to the court, what the Panthers planned to do became that much clearer, at least to them.</p>
<p>The Tar Heels, down two of their top five scorers, brought out a starting lineup in which three players were 6-foot-8 or taller. Pitt, not gifted with the same level of size, countered with only one player taller than 6-foot-6. What the Panthers had learned 10 days earlier in a 73-65 victory at North Carolina was going to be applied again -- if they were, yet again, going to walk away with a win, it was going to be because they, yet again, used their speed and versatility to create mismatches and best a taller opponent.</p>
<p>It worked. In a 66-52 win Saturday at the Petersen Events Center, Pitt used an offensive explosion in the first half to create a 20-point gap going into halftime from which its opponent would be unable to recover.</p>
<p>That offense excelled in a way it hasn’t all season, at least not against an ACC foe, by forcing turnovers, yes, but by spacing out North Carolina and making its bigger players defend in that space against shorter, quicker opponents.</p>
<p>“I think we did a really good job of spacing the floor and spacing them out, making their big guys have to do a better job on the pick and roll,” guard Ryan Murphy said. “Trey [McGowens] and X[avier Johnson], they’re tough to guard in the pick and roll.”</p>
<p>The Panthers were buoyed by uncommonly good (for them) 3-point shooting in the first half, when they made six of their 15 shots from deep. Beyond capitalizing on those looks, though, there were several moments in which the Tar Heels -- one of the 30 tallest teams in the country, one that ranks among the top 50 Division I teams in percentage of points from inside the arc -- were stretched thin.</p>
<p>In many of these instances, there’s not a single Pitt player occupying the paint, even if it’s someone as long as 6-foot-10 Terrell Brown. It comes after a bit of a push against North Carolina’s Andrew Platek, but Justin Champagnie was able in the first half to find some open space near the corner and get an open shot he drilled.</p>

<p>About midway through the half, as Xavier Johnson held the ball at the midcourt logo, there was nobody in the paint and just four players below the top of the key. Part of that is due to a high ball screen from Eric Hamilton, which forced his defender, Armando Bacot, to follow him far out from the basket, but it opened up room for Johnson to drive to the basket, though he missed a floater.</p>
<p>Later in the half, Johnson was put in a similar position, albeit with Brown setting the screen this time, and converted, with the players who would normally block or contest such an attempt drawn far away from the hoop.</p>

<p>“It was a big emphasis,” Johnson said. “We’re a fast-breaking team. They have two bigs. We were trying to make them guard.”</p>
<p><strong>Au’Diese Toney helped make that focus on mismatches that much more effective</strong></p>
<p>Pitt’s larger margin of victory and relative ease in beating North Carolina in their second matchup, in contrast to what was a comeback win in the first meeting, could easily be tied to the difference between playing on the road and at home. A bigger factor, however, was the presence of Au’Diese Toney, Pitt’s sophomore forward who missed the first game with an elbow injury.</p>
<p>Toney is not only one of the team’s best defenders, but also one of the most versatile, allowing him to play on any number of North Carolina players, from 6-foot-5 Brandon Robinson to the 6-foot-10 Bacot. In a game in which foul trouble limited Champagnie to just 15 minutes, depriving the Panthers of one of their best and most flexible players, Toney’s availability became that much more valuable.</p>
<p>“We can slide him down and we can move someone else in,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “We can put him on a Robinson and feel like he can do a good job. We can put him on a Bacot or Brooks and feel like he’ll fight and he can do a good job. He has experience. He does nice things for us. It’s great to have him back.”</p>
<p>Offensively, he helped Pitt get off to its fast start, scoring six points in the first 6:47 to give his team a 14-7 lead. In the process, he showed off moves and shots that he hasn’t often this season -- like a drive with a hesitation move, jump step and slight pump fake that threw off his defender and allowed him to make an open shot in the lane -- perhaps demonstrating that his sometimes limited game on that end of the court is evolving.</p>

<p><strong>The difference in Pitt’s first-half offense and second-half offense was severe</strong></p>
<p>As excellent as the Panthers were in building a lead as large as 23 in the first half, they stumbled in the final 20 minutes and were fortunate North Carolina was never able to get closer than 10 points.</p>
<p>The splits between the two periods is drastic.</p>
<p><strong>First half</strong>: 43 points, 48.4% on field goals, 40% on 3s, 1.34 points per possession</p>
<p><strong>Second half</strong>: 23 points, 22.7% on field goals, 10% on 3s, 0.72 points per possession</p>
<p>The Tar Heels spent much of the second half in a zone, which Capel said forced his team to play “a little bit safe.” It’s a look against which Pitt continues to struggle. With a game at Syracuse in six days and with other opponents who may employ such a scheme left on the schedule, it’s something against which the Panthers are going to have to improve.</p>
<p>“It made us think and we couldn’t get into the same rhythm that we had,” Capel said.</p>
<p><strong>Numbers of note</strong></p>
<p><strong>37</strong>: Points Pitt outscored North Carolina by in the second half of its Jan. 8 game in Chapel Hill and the first half of Saturday’s win, a combined score of 88-51.</p>
<p><strong>21</strong>: Offensive rebounds collected by North Carolina, the most Pitt has allowed an opponent to get this season. Off those boards, the Tar Heels got 24 second-chance points, accounting for 46.2 percent of their total points.</p>
<p><strong>0.769</strong>: Terrell Brown’s shooting percentage in Pitt’s past three games, making 10 of his 13 shots and displaying a really smooth mid-range jumper. He had shot four of 14 in the four games before that.</p>
