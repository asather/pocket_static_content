<p>Watching YouTube videos can lead to great things.</p>
<p>Cranberry resident Ron Lyndon was watching “Shark Tank Australia” when he saw an idea he thought he could make his own. The show featured two mates pitching their company, Life-size&nbsp;Plans. The basic idea is that clients could walk through blueprints projected onto a large space&nbsp;before building a house. It solved a big problem for nonarchitects: visualizing&nbsp;a&nbsp;space before it is built.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I took the idea and adapted it after my wife and I talked about it,” Mr. Lyndon said.&nbsp;“This is the first of its kind in the United States.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>His company, Walkable Plans (<a href="http://www.walkableplans.com" target="_blank">www.walkableplans.com</a>), is based in a 5,000-square-foot space inside Pittsburgh Mills mall in Frazer that is essentially a giant projection room where architectural blueprints show up on the floor.</p>
<p>“It is full, life-size&nbsp;scale so an architect or builder can walk their clients through them and allow them to see their future space. This is not virtual reality or a 3D model. We project an exact scaled image of the floor plan&nbsp;onto our floor.”</p>
<p>Actually the projections are within 1 or 2% of the real thing.&nbsp;“That translates to a 1- or 2-inch difference.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walkable Plans allows builders and architects to take clients through everything from an addition to a full home. The cost to see your blueprints come to life is $1,200 per hour.</p>
<p>“The second hour is discounted to $800, but we do it in 15-minute increments so you just pay for what you need,” Mr. Lyndon said, noting that the cost for additions and other small projects is $600.</p>
<p>“Making changes at the blueprint stage is much cheaper than when the building starts,” he said.</p>
<p>Many homeowners have trouble visualizing size and space from blueprints. “The first clients who used the facility were building an 11,000-square-foot home, a significant house,” Mr. Lyndon recalled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our facility allows them to experience it in exact size including real furniture and walls.”</p>
<p>Sofas, chairs, a king-size bed, twin beds, tables and a coffee table are all on wheels so clients can get a feel for how things will fit into the rooms.</p>
<p>“We also have portable walls to help define the space,” he noted.</p>
<p>The response so far from architects, builders and&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;builders has been very positive, Mr. Lyndon said.&nbsp; “The&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;builders are particularly interested because you can bring all of the decision makers into this space at one time&nbsp;to&nbsp;look at the plans and sign off right here.”</p>
<p>The core principles of construction and design have always interested Mr. Lyndon.</p>
<p>“I helped design part of a house my parents were building when I was 12. I have always liked home theaters, projectors and equipment and networking.”</p>
<p>After architects send plans over, it takes us about an hour to set it up.</p>
<p>“It costs a lot more to change something once the walls are up,” he noted. “Clients will walk into the house mid-construction and find something that is wrong or that they didn’t understand from the floor plans. Change requests at that point get really expensive and cause delays.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>That can add up quickly on a large home, Mr. Lyndon said.</p>
<p>“The price of seeing your floor plans and walking through them is about the price of a refrigerator. When you are building a $400,000 or more home, this is cost-effective.”</p>
