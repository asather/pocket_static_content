<h1>Pirates' focus ahead of spring training: Internal improvement and a streamlined process</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Neither Pirates manager Derek Shelton nor general manager Ben Cherington were willing to define if the team was rebuilding or ready to compete in 2020 when they met with the media at PiratesFest Friday at PNC Park.</p>
<p>“We are focused on getting better,” Cherington said. “I think that’s really every kind of resource you can imagine whether it’s time, energy or dollars, will go into getting better. And that is not always a straight line, as we know, but … every day in 2020, we are going to spend on trying to get better.”</p>
<p>Cherington will keep his proverbial cards close to the vest for now. Frankly, it’s the right way to play the situation. As frustrating it is for fans not to know the direction, it behooves Cherington and the Pirates to move in silence.</p>
<p>Cherington addressed the lack of player signings so far but didn’t directly say when the team might make moves.</p>
<p>“There are several ways to make the team better,” Cherington said. “That can include player-related opportunities — it can consist of acquiring players, it may include trading players at some point. But it also includes a lot of other activities like working with the coaching group and looking into our scouting process — amateur, international, professional, etc., throughout baseball operations.”</p>
<p>Shelton voiced similar sentiments when asked about the Pirates needs heading into spring.</p>
<p>“Spring training is so important to us. We’re different than most clubs because we need to put eyes on our guys,” Shelton said. “We need to see people on the field and what they’re doing and how they’re doing it and how they react. You can watch video, or you can watch game simulation. It doesn’t go to the test. Until we get into that, it’s probably a better March 15/​March 17 question than it is January 24.”</p>
<p>The duo shed light on a few players and gave some insight into how this leadership group might differ from the previous group.</p>
<p><strong>Changing the culture</strong></p>
<p>Shelton has a good grasp on working with the modern athlete. He’s aware of the shortened attention spans. He indicated there would be fewer meetings at spring training.</p>
<p>“Number 1, players don’t like meetings. I don’t think they want meetings where there’s not a specific purpose,” Shelton said. “There are meetings that players have almost requested like we need to go over X, Y and Z. So we’ll facilitate that.”</p>
<p>Former Pirates manager Clint Hurdle conducted several meetings at camp. There was a lot of rigidness with how the hitting and pitching groups operated, with complicated charts that often confused players. Expect things to be less uptight with Shelton.</p>
<p>“When we have a meeting or something happens, it’s going to have a specific purpose because my experience with meetings or people that have a lot of meetings is, it loses its luster. It’s like yelling. If you yell a lot, then it becomes, ‘OK, he’s just yelling.’ If you yell every once in a while, it grabs someone’s attention,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>Playing pro baseball is a serious matter. It is still a game, though, and Shelton wants to bring that to camp and beyond.</p>
<p>“If you have a ton of meetings, then guys sit in meetings like, ‘Oh my God, we’re having another meeting,’ instead of like, there’s a sole purpose of what we’re doing,” Shelton said. “We’re going to be specific on how we’re doing it, what we’re doing and going about it. It’s going to be different because that’s how I am.”</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts on Archer</strong></p>
<p>Shelton expressed excitement about the progress of pitcher Chris Archer. Last season was rough for Archer, who came into spring training off a hernia surgery and never found a groove. Shelton expects a different Archer in 2020.</p>
<p>“The one thing about Chris Archer is he’s really good. But when he’s motivated, he’s even better. And I think Arch thrives on people telling him he can’t do things,” Shelton said. “He’s going to prove to you that he can. He didn’t have the year that he wanted last year. I’m excited about Chris Archer.”</p>

<p>Shelton and Cherington said pitchers Chad Kuhl and Edgar Santana are on track to be ready for spring training after each had Tommy John surgery. Outfielder Gregory Polanco also is expected to be ready for the season after being shut down in the summer with shoulder problems.</p>
<p>“He looks good,” Shelton said. “He’s healthy and he’s working toward being healthy, which is the most important thing.”</p>
