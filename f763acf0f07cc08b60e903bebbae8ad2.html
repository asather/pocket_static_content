<h1>Are seniors in nursing homes particularly vulnerable to COVID-19?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Seniors are particularly at risk from COVID-19, and a recent rash of cases and deaths in Pennsylvania nursing homes has grimly underlined this fact.</p>
<p>In Allegheny County, all coronavirus-related deaths to date have been in adults age 65 or older, although that age group accounts for only 20% of reported cases. Several of these deaths have been in nursing homes, and the number of infected residents in nursing facilities is rising rapidly.</p>

<p>Why are nursing homes so vulnerable, and are they actually riskier than living alone or with family?</p>
<p>Elizabeth O’Keefe, a geriatrician with UPMC, said that an elderly person’s immune system simply isn’t as effective as a young, healthy person, and chronic diseases and underlying conditions tend to accumulate with age.</p>
<p>“It’s just an easy setup for spread when people are close to one another,” she said, adding that there has not yet been a case at a UPMC-owned nursing&nbsp;facility.</p>
<p>“We all know that it’s probably going to come into all the nursing homes in the end,” Dr. O’Keefe said.</p>
<p>There are isolated cases of families removing residents from nursing homes, but Dr. O’Keefe said this could do more harm than good and is unlikely to become widespread.</p>
<p>The White House, in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, issued recommendations to state and local governments on April 2 regarding nursing homes and COVID-19, identifying such facilities as accelerators for the virus.&nbsp;The recommendations urge state and local leaders to consider the needs of long-term care facilities when apportioning equipment and tests, and that facilities follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding equipment and separate staffing teams.</p>
<p>Nursing homes now are focused primarily on keeping the virus out, as it’s difficult to prevent it from spreading once it enters. Visitation has been restricted for several weeks, and some facilities are requiring staff to work at only one facility to reduce the risk of cross-contamination by staff and ambulatory services.</p>
<p>Still, according to the CMS, surveys sent out to facilities nationally during the week of March 30 found that about one-third of facilities did not follow proper hand-washing guidelines and one-quarter failed to demonstrate proper use of personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>Nursing homes across southwestern Pennsylvania have tested positive for the virus, including Southminster Place, Rochester Manor and Villa, and Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center. At the Brighton facility, the virus has spread to more than 40 residents and already has caused five deaths.</p>
<p>“This is the perfect storm,” said Zachary Shamberg, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Health Care Association, an advocacy organization for elderly and disabled individuals that serves hundreds of senior care facilities.</p>
<p>The CDC estimates that Pennsylvania has roughly 700 nursing homes.</p>
<p>Mr. Shamberg said that facilities his organizations serves are constantly reporting a lack of personal protective equipment, and he worries that Gov. Tom Wolf’s April 8 executive order allowing the state to move equipment from one health care provider to another will exacerbate this issue. He also cited lack of testing for staff and residents as a concern, as facilities do not have the capacity to test all staff and residents.</p>
<p>Dr. O’Keefe said that while the nursing home statistics are terrible, without widespread testing, seniors who do not live in nursing homes could be dying in similar numbers.</p>
<p>“I don’t know that anyone has studied whether the death rate is actually higher in nursing homes,” she said.</p>
