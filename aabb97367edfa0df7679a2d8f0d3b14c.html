<p>ST. LOUIS — Sidney Crosby was put on notice Friday at Enterprise Center.</p>
<p>About three hours before the NHL All-Star skills competition began, a confident youngster from the 2030 draft class said he is coming for Crosby.</p>
<p>Alex Letang, the 7-year-old son of Kris Letang, said he hopes to wear No. 58 for the Penguins one day. But if his dad is still playing, he’ll take No. 87.</p>
<p>“If Crosby stops playing, I’ll be the number for Crosby,” Alex declared.</p>
<p>This, of course, got a hearty laugh from Kris Letang, clearly a proud papa.</p>
<p>“Tell Sid to retire,” Kris Letang joked. “Don’t say that. We still need him.”</p>
<p>The Penguins defenseman is in St. Louis for the sixth All-Star Game of his career. A year ago, the whole Letang clan attended the game in San Jose, Calif. This year, it was just Kris and Alex. They flew in Friday for the All-Star skills competition, where Alex would watch the events from the ice next to Kris.</p>
<p>First, they walked the red carpet together, then reported for Letang’s Q&amp;A session. Alex, who had a black-and-yellow Penguins cap pulled over his shaggy black hair, hopped up on Letang’s lap and began holding court as the cameras rolled.</p>
<p>“We made it just a trip for me and Alex,” Kris said. “And it’s already interesting.”</p>
<p>Added Alex, who at this point had drawn a crowd: “My mom didn’t want to come to the All-Star Game with my baby sister. Because the baby will scream. … We don’t want her to cry at the All-Star Game. I really want to listen to this.”</p>
<p>Needless to say, life is a little different for Letang since his first All-Star Game in 2011. Letang, in his fourth season as a regular in Pittsburgh, remembers arriving in Raleigh, N.C., for the game that year and being in awe most of that weekend.</p>
<p>“Life’s changed a lot,” he acknowledged. “But when you get there and you’re on the red carpet, most of those guys were guys I looked up to when I was younger, even before I was in the league. Having the chance to be on the same ice and all the skill, it’s something you watch as a kid on TV, it’s really exciting.”</p>
<p>Now, Letang is one of those older guys. Only two players here, Patrick Kane and Shea Weber, have been selected to more All-Star Games than the 32-year-old. And with Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals sitting out the game Saturday to rest, Letang is the captain for the Metropolitan Division.</p>
<p>That was of great interest to Alex Letang, who had heard that his dad would be the captain and was eager to see in St. Louis what exactly that entailed. Alex added that he is pumped to see players from his many favorite teams.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited to see the hockey players from Florida, the Sharks, Nashville, and the Pittsburgh Penguins. Those are my favorite teams. Kings,” Alex said. “That will make me happy because those are the teams I really like.”</p>
<p>Of course, his favorite player is still his dad. Like Kris, Alex is a defenseman, too.</p>
<p>“I already play hockey,” he clarified. “I’m not in the NHL but I still play hockey.”</p>
<p>Alex said he would be happy to “take my dad’s place” on the Penguins someday. But if Kris is somehow still in the NHL when Alex is 18, they can play together.</p>
<p>“My dad’s going to do the password, and I’ll just get in,” Alex explained, getting another big laugh from Kris and a still-growing group of media members.</p>
<p>After 11 minutes, Kris cut off Alex, explaining that he would chat away all night if they let him. Before they left the podium, Alex had one more thing to add.</p>
<p>“I just want to say hi to my friends if they see me on TV,” he said. “Hi, guys.”</p>
