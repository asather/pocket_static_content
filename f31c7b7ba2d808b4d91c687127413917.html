<h1>Dropped gloves, big scrimmage comeback put exclamation point on Penguins camp</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins on Saturday held their fourth and final intrasquad scrimmage of their postseason training camp. It was nearly a full-squad affair, with 14 skaters a side and all four goalies in uniform.</p>
<p>There was one notable absence.</p>
<p>Sidney Crosby, who practiced with the team Friday, was held out. He instead skated on an individual basis on the other rink for more than an hour, so we presume it was merely precautionary as he works his way back from whatever he is or was dealing with. Per NHL rules, the Penguins can’t share details.</p>
<p>With Crosby out, Evan Rodrigues was again between Jake Guentzel and Conor Sheary. That line wore white, as did the Teddy Blueger line. Tristan Jarry was their goalie. In black were the trios led by Evgeni Malkin and Jared McCann and the top defensive pair of Brian Dumoulin and Kris Letang, plus Matt Murray.</p>
<p>Here are six observations from the scrimmage, which got a little chippy before the black team won, 5-2, thanks to five unanswered goals in the third period.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> As the Penguins huddled at center ice at the end of Friday’s practice at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, coach Mike Sullivan told his players he wanted them to treat this scrimmage as if it were an actual game, both in terms of preparation and passion. Well, two guys took that a little too seriously. During the second period, McCann and Brandon Tanev dropped the gloves moments after McCann drove the net and Tanev stood him up. They were separated before haymakers were exchanged. Sullivan initially seemed irked, but he probably didn’t mind the end result. Both teams ratcheted up the intensity after that and the second half of the scrimmage felt like a game that had something at stake. That couldn’t hurt with Game 1 against the Montreal Canadiens now just seven days away.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> One thing Sullivan definitely couldn’t have been thrilled about was some of the decisions made at the blue line, one of the most critical areas on the ice. Whether it was forwards trying to dance around a defender at the offensive blue line or a careless pass exiting the zone, a bunch of plays Saturday were similar to ones that killed the Penguins in last year’s early playoff exit. Kris Letang was involved in a few of those plays in the scrimmage, including a breakout pass that was picked off by Anthony Angello. Letang screamed a four-letter word as he scrambled to get in position. Sam Lafferty’s shot from the slot thankfully sailed wide.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> It was fair to wonder about Patric Hornqvist’s game readiness after the power forward spent two weeks in quarantine upon returning from Sweden and then missed the first week of camp due to potential secondary exposure to COVID-19. Yeah, Hornqvist is going to be just fine. He had plenty of juice left during the third period when he scored a pair of goals, the first on a deflection and the second on a nifty move in front. He added a goal in a power play drill, just for kicks.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Can you believe I made it all the way to No. 4 before getting into the goalies? Murray was solid. He surely wishes he could have a five-hole goal by Angello back. But he made several quality saves, including a point-blank Guentzel one-timer and a Rodrigues breakaway. Tristan Jarry, on the other hand, fell apart in the third period. The first two goals that got by him were legit. But he should have shrugged off the long-distance Patrick Marleau wrist shot that gave the black team the lead. In total, Jarry allowed four goals Saturday. Overall, he had a pretty good camp. But it probably wasn’t enough to put Murray on the pine.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> John Marino did not forget how to play hockey during the pause. The blue-liner, who turned 23 in May, is rarely out of position and always seems to make a smart decision with the puck. In the first period of the scrimmage, Evgeni Malkin barged down the right wing, 1-on-1 with the rookie. Malkin didn’t have a great angle, so he dropped his shoulder and tried to barrel through Marino on his backhand. But Marino stood his ground and calmly poked the puck into the corner when he got an opening. Moments later, Marino was alone with three opponents in the corner and somehow emerged with the puck, flipping it up the ice to create an odd-man rush. I’ve missed watching Marino play. He makes everything look easy.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Prospects Samuel Poulin and Pierre-Olivier Joseph have a chance to be solid building blocks for the Penguins down the road. But neither looks ready to play a role in these playoffs. Which, duh. They’re 19 and 21, respectively. Poulin is really strong for his age and hasn’t gotten pushed around the last two scrimmages. And he already has an NHL-caliber shot, which Jarry saw firsthand when the youngster cracked him in the cage. But Poulin needs more polishing before he makes his pro debut. Meanwhile, the knock on Joseph has been that he’s not strong enough yet. That checks out. He also seemed nervous with the puck when pressured. Again, both kids rightfully have the Penguins excited. But they’re not ready yet.</p>
