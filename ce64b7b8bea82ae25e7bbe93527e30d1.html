<h1>Farmers could be biggest beneficiaries in new U.S.-China trade deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed a partial trade deal with China on Wednesday that includes commitments from China to purchase $200 billion in American goods and heads off an escalation in tensions between the world’s two largest economies.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, before signing the agreement alongside Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, called it “a sea change in international trade” and “the biggest deal anyone has ever seen.” The deal aims to hold China accountable on intellectual property protections for U.S. companies and sets a standard for currency manipulation.</p>
<p>A key component of the deal, Mr. Trump said, calls for China to purchase $50 billion worth of U.S. farming products annually. American farmers have been hit hard in recent months by plummeting commodity prices, partially caused by Chinese tariffs imposed in retaliation for the Trump administration’s trade aggressions.</p>
<p>“The farmers are going to be so happy,” Mr. Trump told a packed White House East Room before signing the agreement. “Go out and buy a larger tractor.”</p>
<p>The Chinese also agreed to spend $75 billion on American manufactured goods, $50 billion on energy products and $40 billion on services. It was not immediately clear how China intends to meet those goals.</p>
<p>In exchange, the U.S. agreed to cut tariffs on $120 billion of Chinese imports to 7.5% from the previous rate of 10%, Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p>U.S. tariffs of 25% will remain enforced on another $250 billion worth of Chinese goods coming into the country — and Mr. Trump said those will stay in place until the second phase of the trade deal is completed.</p>
<p>Negotiations toward a phase two deal will begin once phase one is rolled out, Mr. Trump said. He said he does not expect there to be more than two phases.</p>
<p>At the signing ceremony — which was filled to capacity with reporters, including many from Chinese media — both leaders spoke of mutual cooperation and hope that the U.S. and China can work together toward future goals.</p>
<p>“China has given us a lot of help, and we’ve given them a lot of help,” Mr. Trump said, noting that China is helping the administration on denuclearization efforts in North Korea and cracking down on shipments of fentanyl, the powerful drug that has flooded into the U.S. from China in recent years.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu, the Chinese vice premier, called the deal “mutually beneficial and win-win agreement.” Through an English interpreter, Mr. Liu framed the deal as positive as China shifts from “high-speed growth to high-quality development.”</p>
<p>“At times, there were setbacks in our trade talks because, on some issues, we don’t see eye to eye,” Mr. Liu said. But “our economic teams did not give up.”</p>
<p>Mr. Liu also read aloud a letter from President Xi Jinping, who sent his “warm greetings.” Mr. Xi wrote the deal “is good for China, for the United States, and for the whole world.”</p>
<p>He added, “I hope the U.S. side will treat fairly Chinese companies” as a matter of “mutual respect.”</p>
<p>“China is prepared to work with the U.S. in that direction,” Mr. Xi wrote.</p>
<p>The deal is a major development for the president, who is facing an impeachment trial in the Senate as soon as next week. The deal was signed shortly after the House of Representatives named its managers for the trial — news Mr. Trump referenced a few times in sometimes rambling remarks.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump appeared relaxed and in good spirits, spending the first half-hour introducing dozens of people in the room and cracking jokes. Those in attendance included much of his Cabinet, White House trade staff, Republican senators and representatives and other supporters, like Lou Dobbs.</p>
<p>The contingent included Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler. “What a friend,” he said of Mr. Kelly.</p>
<p>He then panned the room, pointing out current and former CEOs, including the leaders of Boeing, Dow Chemical, JPMorgan Chase, VISA, Citibank, Jeep, eBay, ConocoPhillips and Nucor, the Charlotte, N.C.-based steel company.</p>
<p>“We’ve been fighting the steel things,” Mr. Trump said to the Dan DiMicco, the former CEO and chairman of Nucor. “It was the fight of two people against the world,” he said, referring to himself and Mr. DiMicco.</p>
<p>Steel has driven much of Mr. Trump’s agenda on putting up trade barriers and renegotiating trade deals. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump referenced a campaign rally in Pennsylvania as the start of his ambitions to level the playing field with China.</p>
<p>“In June of 2016, in the great state of Pennsylvania, I promised that I would use every lawful presidential power to protect Americans from unfair trade,” Mr. Trump said. “Unlike those who came before me, I’ve kept my promise.”</p>
