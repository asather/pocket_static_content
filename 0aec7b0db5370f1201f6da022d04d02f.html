<h1>‘Bad apple’ police officers must be removed, Ohio’s Gov. DeWine says</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Tuesday said prevention of the type of police misconduct that led to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis must include a look back at officers with a history of bad behavior.</p>
<p>“It is interesting that if you are a nurse, if you’re a teacher, you get a license,” the governor said speaking in Columbus while cities the nation over continue to reel from violent clashes between police and people protesting Mr. Floyd’s death.</p>
<p>“And you can lose a license, and there is a central board that has that authority,” he said. “That is something, I think, we should look at in regard to police officers. This is a profession. It is a very noble profession, and it should, in my opinion, probably be treated as a profession.”</p>
<p>He plans to present more detailed recommendations for reforms on Thursday for the General Assembly to tackle.</p>
<p>“There needs to be some changes,” Mr. DeWine said. “It doesn’t mean that the vast majority of police officers aren’t great. They’re doing a good job. But you get one bad apple, and it ruins it for society, and you see horrible tragedies.”</p>
<p>His briefing with reporters on Tuesday, usually focused on the state’s response to the coronavirus crisis, focused primarily on the protests occurring in Ohio and across the nation in reaction to Mr. Floyd’s death while in custody of Minneapolis police.</p>

<p>But the news conference did occasionally return to the coronavirus that has plagued the state for three months:</p>
<p>● The governor announced that, barring a spike in infections, he fully expects K-12 schools, shuttered for this academic year, to return this fall with students physically in classrooms. Details on when and how are still to be worked out with many of the decisions to be made by local superintendents.</p>
<p>● Thursday will bring announcements for the reopening of of zoos, among the few institutions in the state still awaiting for word on when they can emerge from hibernation. A working group is preparing rules for how they can operate while minimizing transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>As Mr. DeWine spoke, Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers waited in the Statehouse atrium, their protective shields lined up along the walls in the adjacent Senate building, prepared for potentially a sixth night of protests. Ohio National Guard members clad in camouflage watched the streets of the state’s capital with military vehicles. Night curfews are in effect.</p>
<p>The governor expressed solidarity with local mayors to maintain and restore peace in the ongoing spate of protests and some related violence.</p>
<p>“That protesting, demonstrating is certainly not only understandable, but it is very appropriate.” Mr. DeWine said. “One of the sad things that we have seen is that some violent individuals, because of their violence, have drowned out some of the voices of reason and some of the voices of those who are talking about things that we all should be talking about.”</p>
<p>He said that mayors have told him that “the vast majority of demonstrators have been peaceful, want to talk, want to protest, want to get people’s attention about very legitimate issues,” and that a small number are interested in violence and vandalism.</p>
<p>The governor has already ordered the Ohio National Guard to support local police in Columbus and Cleveland — at their mayors’ requests. While 100 Ohio soldiers have been sent to Washington at the request of the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Mr. DeWine has not deployed guardsmen generally throughout the state except for on coronavirus-related duties.</p>
<p>“We stand ready to send in the National Guard and to make the highway patrol available for functions the patrol can do and will do,” he said. “All that is in support of the local government.”</p>
<p>Both the governor and his state health director, Dr. Amy Acton, said they are concerned about a possible increase in coronavirus infections because of the lack of social distancing seen in social media and news coverage of protests.</p>
<p>“Certainly protests, the First Amendment, have never been prohibited [in the state’s health orders],” Dr. Acton said. “We should just again ask that everyone do it as safely as they can. I see lots of pictures of folks trying to do it safely ...</p>
<p>“It will be weeks before we know what impact this might be having [on infections],” she said.</p>
<p>As on Monday, the state health department on Tuesday reported lower-than-average daily numbers for new cases of coronavirus and new hospitalizations.</p>
<p>Total cases number 36,350, up 366 from the previous day but below the 21-day average of 529 new cases. That’s the period that the governor and Dr. Acton have been watching for trends as they continue to work to reopen Ohio’s economy and people interact more.</p>
<p>There were 64 new hospitalizations, fewer than the daily running average of 78, for a total of 6,176. But it was an above average day for reports of fatalities. Fifty-two more people died for a new total of 2,258. The 52 is more than Monday and above the 21-day average of 39.</p>
<p>Dr. Acton drew a correlation between weaknesses in society that have been laid bare by the coronavirus crisis and the protests now occurring in Ohio streets.</p>
<p>“I am begging you, please use your voice, speak, most importantly listen to one another, but I beg of you not to hurt one another,” she said, choking back tears. “We cannot see the other person as that — as ‘other.’ ... When we think of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Aubery, I think the thing that will always live with me is that George called out to his mother.”</p>
