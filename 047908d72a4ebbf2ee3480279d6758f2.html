<h1>Penguins grab win against Flyers in OT, 4-3 </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jack Johnson has only been in Pittsburgh for a season and a half. But it’s long enough for him to have gotten wind of the damage his good buddy, Sidney Crosby, has done against the Philadelphia Flyers over his 15 years in the NHL.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve heard about that,” said the smirking blue-liner, who as a teenager first played prep hockey with Crosby at Shattuck St. Mary’s in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Crosby tormented the Flyers once again Friday, snapping a shot over Brian Elliott’s right pad 55 seconds into overtime. That gave the Penguins a 4-3 win after they blew a 3-1 lead in their first game in 10 days due to the All-Star break.</p>
<p>“We had a good view from the bench where we were sitting, kind of right behind him,” Johnson said of the winner. “When our guys crisscrossed, Sid got it and [the Flyers] got a little tangled up. He was walking in and we were all like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah. He’s going to put one in right here.’ And sure enough, he did.”</p>
<p>Crosby tallied three points in Friday’s win at PPG Paints Arena. The captain now has 105 points in 70 career games against their Keystone State rivals.</p>
<p>Much has been made, and it’s all warranted, about Crosby’s domination against the Flyers. But Evgeni Malkin has given them the business, too. Entering Friday, the 33-year-old had 70 points in 57 career games against Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Malkin had a hand in all three Pittsburgh goals during the second period and his line, with Bryan Rust and Patric Hornqvist on his wings, sparked the Penguins after a quiet first period with only three shots getting through to Elliott.</p>
<p>They buzzed around the Flyers’ zone for more than 30 seconds and finally broke through when Hornqvist’s shot from the boards hit a stick and bounced to Malkin at the right post. With his second whack, Malkin hit the back of the net.</p>
<p>Less than two minutes later, after the Flyers hauled down Jared McCann, Rust gave the Penguins a 2-1 lead with his team-leading 22nd goal. They had a 3-on-1 down low when Crosby corralled the puck with his skate and found Rust.</p>
<p>“All five guys might have touched it before it went in, or at least four guys,” Rust said. “Sid made a really nice play to me on the back door and I think it went over the goal line by two inches. … I kind of fanned on it, but a goal’s a goal.”</p>
<p>With 8:57 left in the second period, All-Star defenseman Kris Letang from an improbable angle banked a shot off of Elliott and in, making it a two-goal lead. That goal also came with the Flyers on the penalty kill, giving the Penguins multiple power-play goals for the fourth time in their last seven games.</p>
<p>“They have a high-pressure kill and I thought the guys did a great job,” coach Mike Sullivan said. “There was a lot of movement and I think for me, with just my experience coaching these guys over the last four or five years, when the puck’s moving and people are moving, that’s when our power play is at its best.”</p>
<p>The Flyers started fighting back late in the second period. Tyler Pitlick capitalized on a breakdown by the Penguins in front of their net, beating Tristan Jarry over his glove. Scott Laughton scored on a tap-in to tie it up early in the third.</p>
<p>“First and second period, we played pretty well,” Johnson said. “Third period, we got a little sloppy. We weren’t breaking out cleanly, causing some turnovers there. Turnovers in the neutral zone are usually the root of most problems.”</p>
<p>Jarry responded by stopping James van Riemsdyk from point-blank range. With about five minutes left in regulation, he kicked out his right pad to stop Michael Raffl. Jarry made 16 saves in the third to get the Penguins into OT.</p>
<p>“We didn’t give up a lot in the first two periods. But, having said that, the goals that they scored were high-quality chances,” Sullivan said. “In the third period, I thought he was at his best. He made some real big saves, especially in the last 10 minutes of the period, that gave us an opportunity to get to overtime.”</p>
<p>Jarry, who played in his first NHL All-Star Game last weekend, got the nod over Matt Murray between the pipes. Jarry entered Friday with a league-leading .929 save percentage. Murray, meanwhile, has won five consecutive starts.</p>
<p>Sullivan downplayed the decision, saying that Friday’s game was just one of 82 and that both goalies will be relied upon down the stretch. But the coach added that performance will ultimately dictate how often each goalie plays.</p>
<p>Jarry allowed three goals on 30 shots. None were bad. But Jarry, who has been beaten for exactly three goals in seven of eight starts, was once again steady but beatable. That could open the door for Murray to start Sunday, when they travel to face the first-place Washington Capitals for the first time this season.</p>
<p>The Penguins, by avenging their 3-0 loss in Philadelphia on Jan. 21, improved to 15-4-1 in their last 20 games. It was their league-leading 19th home win.</p>
<p>“Every point is crucial,” Crosby said. “This time of year, your team has to elevate your game. Everyone else is doing the same. So we’re going to try to do that.”</p>
