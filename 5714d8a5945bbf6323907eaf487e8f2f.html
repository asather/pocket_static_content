<h1>Pirates reliever Geoff Hartlieb is finally starting to harness his stuff</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Picking a lane may have finally helped Geoff Hartlieb get to where he’s been wanting to go.</p>
<p>In the process, it has given the Pirates a hard-throwing, late-inning option, someone capable of getting ground balls and strikeouts after figuring out a way to harness his stuff.</p>
<p>“Confidence is definitely growing,” Hartlieb said. “A lot of it comes from trusting my stuff and attacking.”</p>
<p>The 26-year-old right-hander has made nine appearances totaling 10⅔ innings, and he’s pitched to a 2.53 ERA. In his most recent outing, Hartlieb got four key outs in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/08/21/Bryan-Reynolds-shines-in-Pirates-victory-over-Brewers/stories/202008210142" target="_blank">Friday’s 7-2 victory over the Brewers</a>.</p>
<p>As he mentioned, the sinker has become his bread and butter. After alternating between sinkers and four-seam fastballs in 2019, pitching coach Oscar Marin basically told Hartlieb to pick one and stick with it.</p>
<p>That has resulted in Hartlieb throwing sinkers 50.3% of the time in 2020 compared to 29.5% last season. He has not yet thrown a four-seamer and probably won’t. Meanwhile, Hartlieb has upped the usage of his slider, from 20.7% in 2019 to 48.1% in 2020.</p>
<p>“The more you can mix and just be unpredictable, the better results I think you’ll have,” Hartlieb said.</p>
<p>There are a few different reasons why Hartlieb is seeing success, and a big one involves his arm slot. When he was throwing four-seamers, Hartlieb had a higher arm slot that would affect the movement on his sinker. Being at around 2 or 2:30 on a clock has helped his sinker dive.</p>
<p>The slider has played off of that because it comes from a similar arm slot, making it tougher for a hitter to decipher when they might see a sinker or slider. Before, a higher arm slot would tip Hartlieb’s four-seamer.</p>
<p>“The closer those two are, the harder it is for a hitter to pick it up,” Hartlieb said.</p>
<p>But even that doesn’t fully describe the steps forward Hartlieb has taken this season. Offseason foot surgery has literally helped him walk better and also hone his mechanics to where his delivery is more efficient and repeatable.</p>
<p>In October 2019, Hartlieb had foot surgery to repair a broken foot. Turns out he was born with an extra bone in his foot, and it caused a fracture on the inside of his right foot. Hartlieb actually pitched with the injury, trying different ways to compensate, but the results were wildly inconsistent.</p>
<p>His velocity was fine, but Hartlieb was often hit pretty hard. In 35 innings, Hartlieb gave up nine home runs and had an ERA of 9.00.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I understood how bad I was feeling with the foot,” Hartlieb said. “I wasn’t able to sit back on my foot and really push. I was really jumpy, getting out there ahead of myself, and it’s hard to find consistent release points out of that.”</p>
<p>The procedure has decreased Hartlieb’s velocity some. While his sinker averaged 95.0 mph in 2019, it has dipped to 93.8 mph in 2020. Hartlieb knows he has a little more to give, but it also hasn’t mattered.</p>
<p>The bigger thing has been trusting the sinker to do what it’s intended to do — dive at the last second and cause a lot of mis-hits, balls drilled into the ground that are fielded easily for quick outs.</p>
<p>“It’s finding that focal point where, if I start it here, I can get it to end up here. And it changes,” Hartlieb said. “It’s more figuring it out in the bullpen before you get in there, exactly where it’s going that day.”</p>
<p>As far as attacking hitters with his sinker, Hartlieb said he really likes watching Blake Treinen of the Dodgers, who had 38 saves and a 0.78 ERA with the Athletics in 2018. Treinen’s arm slot is higher, but Hartlieb likes the way Treinen trusts the movement with the pitch.</p>
<p>Hartlieb said he’s listened to a couple of podcasts with Treinen talking about how he likes to use his sinker and another with Adam Ottavino of the Yankees, where he nerded out on sequencing his sinker — how to best deceive hitters with what comes before and after the pitch and its placement.</p>
<p>“Those are the two big guys that I’ve really taken some stuff from and I like to work off of,” Hartlieb said.</p>
<p>It’s been a process for Hartlieb, but it’s been important for the Pirates to finally have a reliever making some meaningful progress, especially one with some pretty good stuff.</p>
<p>“It’s putting it in the zone and giving them a chance to attack it,” Hartlieb said. “It’s trusting that, even if they put the bat on the ball, the angle I’m creating with the pitch will, whether it’s hard contact or not, put it in the ground and let my defense make plays behind me.</p>
<p>“I’ve got the stuff to do that consistently. It’s just attacking with those pitches and trusting that it will happen.”</p>
