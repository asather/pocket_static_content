<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bryan McClendon, who was the former offensive coordinator and receivers coach at the University of South Carolina, is at the Steelers’ South Side facility Monday and is the latest candidate to interview for the position of wide receivers coach.</p>
<p>Former Steelers receiver Jerricho Cotchery, who was an assistant wide receivers coach for the Carolina Panthers the past three seasons, interviewed for the position Friday.</p>
<p>An ABC television affiliate in Columbia, S.C., reported Sunday that McClendon, 36, was expected to join Mike Tomlin’s staff as the replacement for Ray Sherman.</p>
<p>Sherman handled those duties last season on an interim basis after Darryl Drake passed away during training camp in August.</p>
<p>McClendon coached at South Carolina since 2015. He coached the receivers from 2015-17 before being named offensive coordinator for the 2018 season. He was demoted from coordinator back to receivers coach for the 2019 season.</p>
<p>From 2009-2014, he was the running backs coach at Georgia, his alma mater. McClendon played receiver for the Bulldogs and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Bears. He went into coaching after he was released.</p>
<p>Cotchery, 37, played for three teams in his 12 NFL seasons, including three with the Steelers (2011-2013). He was part of Ron Rivera’s staff in Carolina since 2017.</p>
