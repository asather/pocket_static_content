<h1>Gene Therapy: Life as a need-to-know proposition</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Thomas Edison, notable inventor, decided one day to invent a kind of reference point that would illuminate what humans actually know in comparison to the totality of what can be known.</p>
<p>“We don’t know a millionth of one percent about anything,” he said.</p>
<p>Eighty-nine years out from his death, it would appear, just lookin’ around, that Edison was being generous that day. And that was without so much as venturing an opinion on what we need to know, which is the bigger issue.</p>
<p>It’s only at the most elementary level that we humans can agree on what we need to know.</p>
<p>For example, do we need to know the exact height of the Washington Monument, 554 feet, 7 and 11/32nds inches?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do we need to know our blood type?</p>
<p>Yes, probably, but I don’t.</p>
<p>Since no one can know every available fact, regardless of its import, we’ve left it to educators and philosophers and doctors of philosophy, your Ph.D.s, to curate a kind of framework of things we need exposure to in order to have a chance at figuring out who we are and, as a result, what we need (and want) to know.</p>
<p>Again, just looking around the ol’ USA, it’s not going well.</p>
<p>Long before philosopher Allan Bloom wrote “The Closing of the American Mind,” in the late ’80s, this curating process began an earnest and often tedious hand-wringing that appears to have reached a kind of breaking point. A recent series of scholarly articles in the Chronicle of Higher Education could not have described it in more urgent terms.</p>
<p>“The academic study of literature is no longer on the verge of field collapse,” reads a summary entitled “Endgame.” “It’s in the midst of it.”</p>
<p>Educators leaped to, um, restate the mission.</p>
<p>“Liberal-arts education is not force-feeding,” G. Gabrielle Starr and Kevin Dettmar of Pomona College wrote. “We are not telling our students to sit down, shut up, and eat their vegetables. We are instead guiding our students in learning how to nourish themselves — and their communities — through feast and famine. Take the teaching that scholars of literature do. We encourage students to think aslant; to find both what seems clearly written in a text and what may be hiding just out of view. This is not a question of force-feeding. It is a practice of reciprocal thinking, questioning, and exploring perspectives very different from those you came in with. It is, as Henry Fielding wrote, about coming to a table that’s laden with many different foods and learning about hospitality, about culture, and about your own and others’ voracious need to understand.”</p>
<p>Outside of the academy, of course, America has rendered this discussion moot. We’ve decided the best thing to know is nothing. I believe “Nothing” beat out “Very Little” as our official position. And we’re no longer even embarrassed about it.</p>
<p>It’s no shock that the president of the United States thinks the Kansas City Chiefs play in Kansas, or that the Democrats in Des Moines had four years to figure out how to tabulate their caucuses and still bombed the test. I don’t blame them. Given centuries of exploding information, pockets of ignorance are going to be evident in the knowledge base of even the very stable geniuses.</p>
<p>The most depressing aspect of all this is the lack of anything resembling agreement on an intellectual starting point. Bloom’s argument, now long in the tooth, was sometimes called the “Great Books Dilemma.” His point was that the great books of Western thought, Plato’s “Republic,” Machiavelli’s “The Prince,” etc., have been devalued as a source of wisdom and, worse, that “our students have lost the practice of and the taste of reading.” This, he said, renders them unable to derive their beliefs from evidence or to think critically about current events.</p>
<p>This and one billion other things.</p>
<p>There persists, in literature, a canon of works sometimes referred to as “the best that has been thought and said,” but there is no longer such a thing as agreement on required reading outside of random syllabi. In an increasingly diverse culture, this is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>“There is a strong argument to be made that a culture with many different arenas of cultural literacy, each with its own, constantly evolving canon of art works (books, yes, but also movies, music, etc.), is a more democratic and pluralistic society than one in which every educated person is expected to know and have read the same things.”</p>
<p>That final quote is from Patrick Collier, Ph.D., chair, English Department, Ball State University. Full disclosure: Collier grew up in the same house I did, but he’s been saying things like that since he was about 9.</p>
<p>The simplest truth is that you can’t know everything, but you should, within that realization, try to know something.</p>
<p>I might even find out my blood type.</p>
