<h1>Jordan Montgomery teases new album with 'Favorite Rappers'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jordan Montgomery takes on the hazards of the rap game with his new single, <a href="https://song.link/i/1509525437" target="_blank">“Favorite Rappers.”</a></p>
<p>The title suggests that the Pittsburgh rapper and founder of Driving While Black Records might be doing a tribute or rundown of his influences, but he goes in another direction with the track, which drops on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“All my favorite rappers so dope / poppin’ champagne with the boat / poppin’ out the range of fur coats / ’til I found out they was broke,” Montgomery raps in the hook.</p>
<p>“The whole album,” he says, “explores how black art is often valued over black life. In the case with the song I tell the story of an upcoming artist who deals with the pressures of the music industry and how those pressures can make an artist conform to lifestyles that may have severe consequences.”</p>
<p>“Favorite Rappers” is the first single from new album “Thank You 4 Ur Purchase But We R Not For $ale,” which will be released on June 30.</p>
<p>Although the album wasn’t completed before the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown, Montgomery already had the parts that mattered.</p>
<p>“I recorded all of the tracks currently on the album prior to the pandemic,” he says. “I was able to send the tracks that still needed mastered to my engineer via email, which kept us on schedule. There were a couple bonus tracks I wanted to add but those will be recorded at a later time. Overall, I’m glad how it turned out.”</p>
