<h1>Highmark thanks EMS teams by donating 40,000 masks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In a time of COVID-19, you can never have too many masks.&nbsp;That was the thinking behind Highmark Health’s donation of 40,000 masks as a thank you to EMS first responders.</p>
<p>“It’s a part of what we have historically called our ‘good deeds’ campaign,” said senior vice president Tom Fitzpatrick as he presented the masks to emergency medical services teams from Plum and Monroeville on Monday in Plum. “It is National EMS Week so we were putting this together and thinking about our different partners.”</p>
<p>The washable cloth masks are meant to be worn for home and casual use. They’re green and blue — Highmark’s colors.</p>
<p>“The purpose of it, really, is to help the EMS providers save resources so when they are not treating patients, or when they are off duty, they can utilize these coverings, as opposed to [wearing an] N95 mask,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said.</p>
<p>The masks are to be distributed across the health system’s network, in Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“EMS professionals have been on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic since Day 1. We owe them an immense amount of gratitude for their ongoing partnership,” Highmark President Deb Rice-Johnson said in a statement.&nbsp;“It’s fitting that we can show our appreciation by providing them with face coverings that will allow for high-grade personal protective equipment to be preserved for when it’s needed most.”</p>
<p>Joe Sesta, administrative director of Plum Emergency Medical Services, said the 35-40 volunteers and paid personnel don’t often get a chance to talk with medical professionals and patients they encounter.</p>
<p>“It’s usually a quick interaction .. very in and out.&nbsp;So it’s kind of nice to be able to thank them for the jobs they do every day, going out and taking care of people.”</p>
