<h1>Expert: Flash in dark sky of Western Pa., Ohio was probably a random meteor</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A flash that lit up the skies over parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio in the early-morning hours of Wednesday was probably a random meteor, an expert said.</p>
<p>Many social media users around the Pittsburgh area reported seeing a streaking “fireball” anywhere from 4 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. It remained in the sky for a short time before disappearing from view.</p>
<p>A trucker heading west on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Bedford County captured what appeared to be a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truckerbeetlebailey/video/6878242449244949765?sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6878280802422736390&amp;is_from_webapp=1" target="_blank">quick streak of light on his dash cam</a>.</p>
<p>“There was also a sonic boom and it lit up the whole entire sky for about 3 to 4 seconds,” he said.</p>

<p>Well-known Pittsburgh photographer Dave DiCello was able to snap a few frames of the tail end of the flash shortly before 6:30 a.m.:</p>
<p>Around the same time, KDKA-TV cameraman Brian Smithmyer said he was on the West End Overlook when he caught sight of it.</p>
<p>The American Meteor Society, a nonprofit group, <a href="https://www.amsmeteors.org/2020/09/bright-fireball-caught-above-ohio/" target="_blank">said it received more than 260 reports</a> from 15 states of “a fireball event that occurred over Ohio” at 6:24 a.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert Lunsford, a society official, said the fireball was most likely a random meteor not associated with any known meteor shower.</p>
<p>It takes an object only the size of a softball to create a flash as bright as the full moon, Lunsford said. This object was probably a bit larger, he added, but more analysis would be needed to determine its size.</p>
<p>“It looks like the Southern Taurids are active right now as a possibility,” one person said on social media, referring to the annual meteor shower associated with the comet Encke.</p>
<p>According to the AMS, the Southern Taurids are a long-lasting meteor shower with “several minor peaks during its activity period.” The shower is active for more than two months in the fall — this year from&nbsp;Sept. 10 to Nov. 20&nbsp;— but rarely produces more than five shower members per hour, even at maximum activity.</p>
<p>“The Taurids (both branches) are rich in fireballs and are often responsible for increased number of fireball reports from September through November,” the society said.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service in Pittsburgh said it was aware of the reports of the flash but had no information. Officials at the University of Pittsburgh’s Allegheny Observatory did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>A security camera at a property owned by Mark and Rosemary Sasala in New Lyme, Ohio, northwest of Pittsburgh, captured a brief, bright flash partially obscured by clouds around 4:20 a.m.</p>
<p>About 50 people quickly took to Reddit earlier this morning to share their take on what it could be.</p>
<p>“I saw it! I was headed into Dunkin downtown when there was a giant flash of light and I looked up to see the giant fireball. And no one else around batted an eye...I questioned if I even saw it,” said another.</p>
<p>Another said he saw the sky light up while heading to work in New Castle.</p>
<p>“I was driving north on 279 around this time when I saw a bright flash in the sky. Thought it was lightning at first,” still another poster said.</p>
<p>Others went so far as to jokingly make an extraterrestrial connection.</p>
<p>“That’s it, 2020, the aliens have arrived! Only logical explanation!” one person mused.</p>
