<p>Pittsburgh native Michael Keaton will star in and executive produce “Dopesick,” an upcoming Hulu series written by Emmy-winner Danny Strong (“Recount,” “Game Change”).</p>
<p>Barry Levinson, who won an Oscar for “Rain Man,” will direct.</p>
<p>The eight-part series is based on Beth Macy’s New York Times bestselling book of the same name and delves into the opioid crisis in America.</p>
<p>Keaton plays an “old-school” doctor caught up in the secret tragedies of Big Pharma.</p>
<p>Given the renowned team involved in the project, “we have every reason to believe this important story will be one of the TV events of the coming year,” said Bert Salke, president of FOX 21 Television Studios said in a statement.</p>
<p>Keaton, a Montour High School graduate, was nominated for an Oscar as best actor in 2014 for “Birdman.” He has focused mostly on feature films, including starring in back-to-back Best Picture winners “Birdman” and “Spotlight.”</p>
<p>He occasionally has popped up on television, most recently in a cameo as Julian Assange on “SNL” and in IFC’s “Documentary Now!”</p>
<p>“Dopesick” marks his return to series television.</p>
