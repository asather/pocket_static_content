<h1>Fitzgerald, Peduto join Democrats in another plea for federal COVID-19 relief</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Members of Pennsylvania’s Democratic Congressional delegation along with state and local Democrats joined on Zoom Thursday to deliver a unified message to Republicans in Washington: another COVID-19 relief package is needed to keep people in their homes.</p>
<p>One after another, the officials shared frustration that talks have all but halted on the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or the HEROES Act, a follow-up to the $2.2 trillion relief package passed in March, which included stimulus checks, supplemental unemployment benefits, paycheck protection funds and other programs.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately while Congress and the president agreed on the need for action in the spring, and even as the virus continued to spread. ... The president and congressional Republicans decided that more relief for businesses and struggling families wasn’t needed,” said U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and other Republicans, say the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/09/10/US-Senate-fails-garner-votes-COVID-19-relief-package-deal-CARES-Act-filibuster/stories/202009100154" target="_blank">blame is on Democrats for holding up negotiations</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto joined the virtual press conference, titled&nbsp;“Western Pa. Making Housing Matter,” to appeal to Congress for local emergency funding — something that wasn’t available to municipalities with populations under 500,000 during the first round of relief.</p>
<p>“The economic destruction has been very painful for us here in this region,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “We don’t want people that can’t pay their rent, so then you force that on the small business landlord who has to pay the mortgage. This help is needed.”</p>
<p>Allegheny County received $212 million in CARES Act funding in the spring. Just over $57.8 million is to be spent on providing meals; housing, rent and utility assistance; and childcare program needs. To date $23.4 million has been spent, according to the <a href="https://tableau.alleghenycounty.us/t/PublicSite/views/AlleghenyCountyCARESActFunding/CountyPriorities?iframeSizedToWindow=true&amp;%3Aembed=y&amp;%3AshowAppBanner=false&amp;%3Adisplay_count=no&amp;%3AshowVizHome=no&amp;%3Aorigin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">county’s funding dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto, who has repeatedly joined other officials to call for local funding for smaller municipalities, said approving the funding should be a&nbsp;“no brainer.”</p>
<p>“This should be a simple way of understanding that during a global pandemic there will be those who will be adversely hurt. But instead, it’s being used a political tool around election day,” Mr. Peduto said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lawrence Swanson, executive director of ACTION Housing, U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans, D-Philadelphia, state Sen. Jay Costa, D-Allegheny County, state Rep. Jake Wheatley, D-Allegheny County, Michael Polite, Pittsburgh developer, and Sister Mary Scullion, executive director of Philadelphia’s Project HOME, also joined the call.</p>
