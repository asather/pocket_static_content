<h1>In New Hampshire, voters making their picks among a field of Democratic hopefuls</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Voters have been arriving at the polling stations for first-of-the-nation primary to help determine who will eventually emerge atop the field of Democratic presidential candidates. It has been a culmination of months of canvassing, door knocking and dollar spending in an effort to collect as many of the 24 delegates at stake here as they can.</p>
<p>It's also where Democrats have spent the past week arguing over each other about who can assemble the broadest and most diverse coalition of party loyalists, independents and moderate Republicans — a big tent they've agreed will be necessary to beat President Donald Trump in contests across the country this November.</p>
<p>Here’s the latest:</p>
<p><strong><em>Updated at 2:55 p.m.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Voters just looking for the best option</strong></p>
<p>CONCORD, N.H. — Three days ago, Daniel Swacha didn't anticipate that he'd be dropping by the Green Street Community Center on the day of the primary election to cast a vote for a Democratic presidential candidate.</p>
<p>But there he was Tuesday afternoon voting for Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, "the only candidate out there I could see worth voting for," he said.</p>
<p>If it weren't for Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Swacha said he would have voted for Donald Trump in the Republican primary. But as an undeclared voter — able to cast a ballot in the party of his choice, a status he shifted to after moving wards recently — he voted for the Democrat he said would be a better diplomat on the international stage and who can help his fellow New Hampshire residents get health insurance.</p>
<p>"I think the rest of them are a clown show," Mr. Swacha, a 56-year-old HR technology worker, said of the other Democrats in the race, calling the primary a "free fest" where everyone's trying to promise more taxpayer money to voters.</p>
<p>Ms. Klobuchar, he said, is compassionate, but isn't going to "give the world away" like other Democrats.</p>
<p>About a hundred feet down Green Street, retired New Hampshire state worker Charle Crompton walked out the front doors of Concord's City Hall, where she had just changed her registration from Republican to independent.</p>
<p>Ms. Crompton, a self-proclaimed "staunch Republican" who said she didn't vote in 2016, said she doesn't trust Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>"I'm a senior, and I don't like his Medicare policies," Ms. Crompton said. "I don't like what he wants to do with Social Security. I depend on my Social Security. I worked my whole life as a state employee for 35 years."</p>
<p>Ms. Crompton, whose father was a Republican state senator in Massachusetts, said she wrote-in former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg on the Republican ballot earlier this morning.</p>
<p>Though Bernie Sanders and Mr. Trump won New Hampshire's state capital in total in 2016, Concord's fifth ward went to Hillary Clinton and John Kasich in the primary.</p>
<p>State Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, a Democrat representing the 10th legislative district that includes Concord's fifth ward, voted for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I was a childcare provider for 45 years," Ms. Wallner said after she voted. "Her policies and plans on childcare and early education were just right on. She really has some good ideas."</p>
