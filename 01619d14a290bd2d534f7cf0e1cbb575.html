<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Another area campus is making a deeper investment in science, this time La Roche University, where officials Friday gathered to celebrate a $6.5 million renovation of the Palumbo Science Center on the McCandless campus.</p>
<p>Officials say the project will better position the university to address growing demand for instruction in the (STEM) fields of science, technology, engineering and math.</p>
<p>Health care, technology and science programming are included as priorities in the university’s capital campaign. Friday morning, officials gathered to celebrate a milestone in that effort —&nbsp;the center’s rejuvenated second floor with state-of-the-art labs, classrooms, common areas and faculty offices with a focus on interactive and hands-on learning.</p>
<p>Sister Candace Introcaso, president of La Roche, was among those in attendance. She said the updated facility enables the campus of 1,400 students to “experience an education that has the potential to change the world in which we live.”</p>
<p>She thanked supporters and donors, among them the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Hoddy and Mary Anne Hanna, S&amp;T Bank and George I. Alden Trust.</p>
<p>Science center construction and renovation are big business in the region, touching both private and public campuses.</p>
<p>La Roche officials noted that the Division of Natural and Behavioral Sciences is the fastest growing academic division at La Roche and that undergraduate enrollment in STEM majors is up 70% in a decade.</p>
