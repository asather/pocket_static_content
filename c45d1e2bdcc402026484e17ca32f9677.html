<h1>Wolf administration announces additional funding for tech industry</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the second time since the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted business operations across the state, Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration has announced additional funding for the technology industry.</p>
<p>The administration announced Friday it had awarded nearly $1.5 million in grants to each of the four Ben Franklin Technology Partners, which are organizations around the state that work to promote entrepreneurs, economic growth and innovation. In Pittsburgh, Innovation Works serves as the region’s tech partner.</p>
<p>In April, the state made a similar pledge, providing <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2020/04/24/Pennsylvania-Community-and-Economic-Department-funding-tech-innovation-startups-Ben-Franklin-Technology-Partners-Innovation-Works/stories/202004240107" target="_blank">$1 million in grants to each of the four tech centers.</a> That time, each partner pledged to match the funding and distribute $2 million to companies in their portfolio and to new ventures.</p>
<p>For startups, the pandemic has dealt many of the same challenges companies in every sector are facing: decreased revenue, a switch to remote work, adjustments to predicted yearly outcomes and hard decisions about layoffs or furloughs. The startup business model, which relies on investors taking a risk and doesn’t always turn a profit right away, has made it difficult for early stage companies to secure government funding and other support, some entrepreneurs have said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, others promote this type of disruption as the ideal time to come up with new innovative ideas and business plans.</p>
<p>“Our commonwealth’s economy is in active recovery from COVID-19 related impacts and this funding will continue to support Pennsylvania’s technology companies as they move forward,” Dennis Davin, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, said in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>“This industry has been an innovative leader in responding to the needs of the state as we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. “So continuing to support their efforts is critical.”</p>
<p>The latest funding announcement also included additional support for venture capitalists and startups in the region.</p>
<p>The Ben Franklin Technology Development Authority approved $1 million in funding for Riverfront Ventures LLC, which works with Innovation Works to invest in early-stage tech companies in southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The BFTDA board also extended the COVID-19 Venture Loan Program, which provides loans to venture capital firms in the region. The program, which was created in April, will now go through September.</p>
<p>The Venture Loan Program originally pledged $10 million to provide emergency funding to startups struggling with coronavirus related issues.</p>
