<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>LONDON — A man was shot dead by police officers after a number of people were stabbed in South London on Sunday, in what the authorities described as a “terrorist-related” incident.</p>
<p>The conditions of those stabbed were not immediately clear.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police wrote on Twitter on Sunday that they believed that “a number of people have been stabbed” and that the man had been shot by armed officers in Streatham, about five miles south of Westminster.</p>
<p>Images on social media showed the body of a man lying on the pavement outside a Boots store, the European pharmacy retailer, on Streatham High Road, while at least two officers pointed guns at him.</p>
<p>A video that circulated on Twitter on Sunday showed what appeared to be at least two undercover officers drawing their weapons as they took cover behind a police car. A flurry of yellow ambulances and police cars with blinking red and blue lights could be seen in other video footage of the busy street.</p>
<p>London was hit by a terrorist attack as recently as November, when a radicalized man was shot dead by the police after he killed two people near London Bridge.</p>
<p>The current terrorism-related threat level in Britain is classified as substantial, meaning that an attack is “likely,” according to the country’s Security Service.</p>
