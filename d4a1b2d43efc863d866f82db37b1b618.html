<h1>Another landslide closes Route 837 between West Mifflin and Dravosburg</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the second time in a month, a landslide closed Route 837 on Monday between the Boswell Oil Co. in Dravosburg and the McKeesport-Duquesne Bridge in West Mifflin.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said its geotechnical teams haven’t inspected the site yet, and it isn’t clear if the slide occurred in the exact area that closed the road for six days beginning March 28. The road reopened after Allison Park Contractors removed debris and installed barriers.</p>
<p>The road will remain closed in both directions until PennDOT evaluates the situation and determines how to correct the problem.</p>
