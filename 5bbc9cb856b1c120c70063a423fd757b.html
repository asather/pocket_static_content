<h1>Fishing Report: Crappies are biting throughout the region</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County) The spearhead of an eastward migration of walleye is nearing Presque Isle. ’Eyes were taken by anglers trolling off Walnut Creek in 10-20 feet of water. Smallmouth bass went for soft plastics east of the peninsula near shore. Lake trout were taken on plugs in 70-80 feet of water off North East. The public docks were put in at the North East Marina and Shades Beach.</p>
<p><strong>Pymatuning Reservoir</strong> (Crawford County) Crappies were taking live minnow and tipped jigs near Jamestown.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Wilhelm</strong> (Mercer County) The crappie bite was heavy around submerged trees and other structure. Successful anglers used tipped minnows weighted with a split shot under a float.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Arthur</strong> (Butler County) The crappie bite was hard and persistent. With the surface temperature at 71.8 degrees Wednesday, schools of white and black crappies were spread out in shallow flats and as deep as 12 feet, depending on time of day. Slabs were hard to find but hit on medium live minnows under a slip bobber or 1/32-ounce jig with a plastic black and chartreuse split-tail grub.</p>
<p><strong>Raccoon Lake</strong> (Beaver County) Trout and panfish were caught all over the lake.</p>
<p><strong>North Park Lak</strong>e (Allegheny County) Good numbers of trout and panfish were caught.</p>
<p><strong>Carnegie Lak</strong>e (Allegheny County) Largemouth bass took live bait.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny Rive</strong>r (Allegheny County) Crappies and small bass took live bait off the North Shore.

<p><strong>Monongahela River</strong> (Greene, Washington counties) Walleye went for midsize live shiners over rocky banks, near major tributaries and below locks and dams. Smallmouth and largemouth bass took top-water lures near shore around dusk.</p>
<p><strong>Cedar Fork Creek</strong> (Potter County) During a hatch of Green Drakes, Mike Domach of Bloomfield landed a beautiful brook trout that took a big No. 8 dry fly. A week earlier at the same location, he caught another on a small streamer.</p>
