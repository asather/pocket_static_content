<h1>BikePGH connects community to free bikes with new partnership</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BikePGH announced in early June the launch&nbsp; of a partnership with a national bike sharing program, Bike Match Network. With essential workers traveling to work every day, the organization states it believes the network can offer people a safer and cheaper commute during the pandemic with a bicycle.</p>
<p>The program is designed to pair people expressing a need for a bike with someone who has one gathering dust at no cost. Applications to donate or receive a bike can be submitted on Bike Match Network’s website, <a href="https://bikematch.network/" target="_blank">bikematch.network</a>. A person’s height, anticipated use of the bike and access are considered before a connection is made.</p>
<p>Kéya Joseph, director of events for BikePGH, said the organization has been planning the partnership since Allegheny County was in the red phase, which ended on May 15. While most exchanges happen in Pittsburgh, Ms. Joseph said the program isn’t confined to city limits.</p>
<p>“All requests and donations will be reviewed, and we will work directly with folks to make that exchange happen,” Ms. Joseph said. “For example, if there's a bike donor in Beaver County we would just say that person has to bring it into [Pittsburgh] to exchange it.”</p>
<p>One of the primary goals of the program is to ensure that commuters feel secure when they travel to work as many have expressed concerns about COVID-19.</p>
<p>“There are still people who definitely don’t feel safe on public transit right now, or want a way around without public transit,” Ms. Joseph said.</p>
<p>When the pandemic began sweeping the nation in March, many individuals were asked to telecommute to work. However, essential workers must work in person every day. According to a May 2019 research study conducted by the Port Authority on ridership, 83% of riders used public transportation to commute to work.</p>
<p>Mask requirements and vehicle capacity limits have been put in place, though Ms. Joseph said “noncompliance” remains an issue on public transportation. Some people submitting bike requests have reported passengers using their masks to enter a bus but taking it off after finding a seat, causing others to feel unsafe.</p>
<p>Adam Brandolph, a spokesman for Port Authority, said complaints about passenger noncompliance have been&nbsp;“significant” over the past few weeks. According to Mr. Brandolph, vehicle operators must pull over and wait for the rider to leave if they do not have a medical exemption for not wearing a mask. Operators must get a second vehicle to move passengers who are currently riding to or call Port Authority police if noncompliance persists.</p>
<p>Complaints about vehicle operators not wearing masks are being reported as well. Mr. Brandolph said it’s a “frustrating process” that has received “increased discipline” over the past week.</p>
<p>“These are certainly things we are mindful of. If you walk down the street not everyone is wearing a mask, on public transit it’s the same in some respects,”&nbsp;Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said Port Authority relies on the passengers to follow safety guidelines as they ride, because drivers are focused on safely operating the vehicle. Port Authority vehicles are disinfected on a nightly basis to keep riders safe as well.</p>
<p>Ms. Joseph said many low-income individuals depend on public transportation and are likely to be deemed essential workers.The same 2019 study reported that 30% of riders had an annual household income of less than $35,000. BikePGH believes the free program can give essential workers the ability to travel without sacrificing their health or finances.</p>
<p>Sara Tang is an essential worker at an independent market in Pittsburgh who “jumped” at the opportunity to receive a free bicycle for her everyday commute. She said she’s had an interest in using a bike to get around Pittsburgh for years, and the program was a reason for her to start.</p>
<p>Ms. Tang received her bike in June, though used it to commute to work for the first time on Monday. After receiving recommendations on the best bike lanes to use, Ms. Tang said she’s eager to recommend Bike Match and urban bicycling to anyone who’s interested.</p>
<p>The Bike Match Network was created in late March by Stephen Braitsch and Sam Sadle, two self-described longtime safe streets activists, in San Francisco. Mr. Braitsch got the idea from a New York City nonprofit connecting people with new bikes. With a background in technology, he decided to make a website that would make exchanges simple and fast.</p>
<p>Currently, Mr. Braitsch said, the Bike Match community is “thriving” as it’s made nearly 100 matches as of Tuesday across 12 major cities including Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Eventually, he hopes the Bike Match Network can make its way across the world.</p>
<p>Ms. Joseph is interested in seeing the partnership with Bike Match continue to grow in Pittsburgh beyond the pandemic. While BikePGH has made only a few matches since June, requests for bikes continue to be sent in every day.</p>
<p>“It’s something that I think still remains relevant, especially for people who have always been using single-use vehicles and are looking for a healthier way to get around,” she said.</p>
