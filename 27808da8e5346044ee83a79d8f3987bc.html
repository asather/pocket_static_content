<h1>Pirates fall to New York Yankees, 7-4</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. â€” Spring training games are generally ugly by nature. The contests are glorified practices where results are less relevant than the next tee time or making dinner plans. However, any time a pitching staff combines for 14 walks creates an extra odious day.</p>
<p>The Pirates lost 7-4 against the New York Yankees on a day when the starting pitcher Chris Stratton lobbed four walks. Stratton got the first two hitters he faced out before walking Miguel Andujar, Mike Ford, and Chris Iannetta to load the bases.</p>
<p>Stratton got out of the inning with no damage by striking out Chris Gittens. The second inning wouldn't be kind to Stratton. He walked Zack Granite to start the frame before Pirates manager Derek Shelton pulled him out.</p>
<p>"I'm still working on some delivery stuff," Stratton said after the game. "I feel like I'm searching at times out there, as you can see today. I wasn't as consistent as I'd like to be. But that's what spring training is for. It's about figuring this stuff out."</p>
<p>The Pirates hope that Stratton figures it out as camp rolls along. Stratton is one of the few guys in the bullpen that has long relief and starter experience. If he's healthy and pitching well, Stratton can be an asset to the team.</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Dovydas Neverauskas threw a scoreless inning in the fifth that caught the attention of Shelton.</p>
<p>"I thought Never was really good. He threw 11 pitches with eight strikes and worked quickly," Shelton said. "He throws 95 or 96. It was outstanding to see him go out and perform."</p>
<p>Michael Feliz, Richard Rodriguez, and Cody Ponce each had scoreless outings. Rodriguez has only allowed one run in his five relief appearances.</p>
<p>James Marvel had a day he'd like to forget. Marvel allowed six runs on three hits and three walks. Pirates farmhand Ike Schlabach also had a weird outing. Schlabach walked five, yes you read correctly, while oddly enough not allowing a run.</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>Gregory Polanco went 2-for-2 with two doubles, a walk, and drove in Jason Martin in the sixth inning. Martin flew around the bases on the ball and scored from first base.</p>
<p>"It was fun watching him run like that," Polanco said of Martin. "I knew he was fast but he took it another level. I was saying 'keep going' while he running the bases."</p>
<p>Martin has been working with new first base coach Tarrik Brock on his baserunning and it showed off on Saturday.</p>
<p>Josh Bell hit 1-for-3 and reached base safely in six straight games. John Ryan Murphy launched a ball into left field for his team-leading third home run. All of Murphy's hit in spring are homers.</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>Three of the runs that Marvel allowed came on a triple by Yankees' prospect Brandon Lockridge. The ball nearly hit first base umpire Jerry Layne who had to duck out of the way quickly. Socrates Brito attempted to make a play on the ball, but he slipped and fell. One of those spring training type plays.</p>
