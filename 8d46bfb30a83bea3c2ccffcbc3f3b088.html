<h1>Caring for Pennsylvania: Josh Shapiro, PNC launch laudable initiative</h1>

<p>The economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating implications for millions of Americans. More than 3 million people filed for unemployment last month, including more than 844,000 in Pennsylvania alone.</p>
<p>In a bid for some temporary assistance for Pennsylvania, state Attorney General Josh Shapiro has called on banks across the commonwealth to offer a package of relief measures that would take pressure off customers who are struggling financially, ensuring that people can sustain themselves during the difficult road ahead.</p>
<p>The package, known as “PA CARES,” would institute 90-day grace periods for mortgages and other consumer loans, and a 60-day moratorium on foreclosure, eviction or vehicle repossession. The measures would also include an expansion of small and medium business loan availability, 90-day relief from fees and charges such as overdraft fees, and no adverse credit reporting for accessing these relief measures.</p>
<p>While participation with PA CARES is voluntary, every bank and financial institution headquartered in Pennsylvania should prove its commitment to its customers and commonwealth by signing on to the program.</p>
<p>PA CARES is being administered through the attorney general’s bureau of consumer protection and will rely upon banks and other financial institutions signing onto the initiative. That effort received a big boost with the announcement that PNC Bank, Pennsylvania’s largest bank, would be the first bank to sign up.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, it is critical that we come together to support our customers, one another and the communities we serve,” said PNC CEO William S. Demchak.</p>
<p>Ensuring the stability and sustainability of our economy and, most important, our fellow citizens will require a collective effort, spanning many different industries, sectors and policies. For Pennsylvanians, PA CARES will provide critical relief in the months ahead, keeping people in their homes and alleviating some of the stress of the moment.</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro’s plan is laudable, as is PNC’s decision to step forward as the first bank to sign onto the initiative. Hopefully, its example will lead to even more institutions joining PA CARES, expanding access to relief throughout the state.</p>
