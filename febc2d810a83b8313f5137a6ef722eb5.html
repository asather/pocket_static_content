<h1>Penguins shut out by the Sharks as their losing streak hits six games</h1>

<p>SAN JOSE, Calif. – Maybe it was the warm weather. But as the losses continued to mount here in California, the Penguins maintained their sunny disposition.</p>
<p>They dropped the first three games of this winless road trip, two of them coming against NHL bottom-feeders. Still, they argued they were on the upswing. Stick together and keep working hard and the goals, and then the wins, would come.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’re digging ourselves a hole,” Patric Hornqvist said late Friday night, after the Penguins dropped to third place in the Metropolitan Division. “But we’re still in a good spot. … Let’s figure out what we’re made of [Saturday].”</p>
<p>If Saturday really showed us what they are made of, they may be in big trouble.</p>
<p>The Penguins, playing the second half of a back-to-back, were chum in the water for the rested San Jose Sharks, who beat them, 5-0, at the SAP Center. They have now lost six games in a row for the first time since the 2011-12 season.</p>
<p>Mike Sullivan’s team has been out-scored, 24-8, during this nightmarish skid.</p>
<p>“It’s a little bit of a head-scratcher. … Consistency this year has been one of the attributes of this group,” the coach said. “For whatever reason, we’ve hit a bump in the road here and we’ve just got to find a way to pull ourselves out of it.”</p>
<p>There were no silver linings in sight after maybe their worst game this season.</p>
<p>Saturday, the Penguins got a quiet night from their superstars. Summing that up was one sequence early in the third period while they were trailing, 3-0. Sidney Crosby was staring down an empty net from 28 feet out. He missed it.</p>
<p>“I think we understand what it takes to win. But I put it on myself. I’ve got to step up,” said the captain, who has just one point and a minus-8 rating during this losing streak. “Key situations, you’re down like this and losing games, you need big plays, big performances. And I haven’t done that. So that’s on me.”</p>
<p>Again, the power play didn’t provide the Penguins a spark. They went 0-for-4.</p>
<p>And they continued to lack secondary scoring from role players such as Jared McCann, Dominik Simon and Brandon Tanev. McCann hasn’t scored in 17 games. Simon and Tanev have each gone a dozen games since their last goal. None of their three trade deadline pick-ups have lit the lamp either.</p>
<p>Martin Jones, one the NHL’s shakiest starting goalies, was the latest to boost his stats against a Penguins team that was shut out for the second time in two weeks. With 30 saves, Jones earned just his fourth win since the start of December.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a lack of offense. The Sharks had the Penguins on their heels all night. Despite giving up five goals on 31 shots, Tristan Jarry was actually pretty good.</p>
<p>“It’s tough. … We’re getting behind in games and chasing it, and the puck’s not going in for us right now,” Crosby said. “And that’s a tough combination.”</p>
<p>Jarry was outstanding in the first as the Sharks peppered his pads with pucks and whizzed shots past his ears. They finally broke through late in the period.</p>
<p>As Marcus Pettersson made a break for the bench, Sharks defenseman Marc-Edouard Vlasic snapped a pass up the middle to Evander Kane. The Sharks winger, typically a headache for the Penguins, pulled the puck from his backhand to his forehand then flicked a shot past Jarry’s blocker for the game’s first goal.</p>
<p>In the second period, Timo Meier beat Jarry from the right circle. Three minutes later, Joel Kellman sneaked a shot between Jarry’s pads to push it to 3-0.</p>
<p>A month or two ago, when the Penguins were a resilient bunch that relished any opportunity to karate-kick adversity in the throat, they would have came roaring back to at least make it interesting.</p>
<p>But Saturday, one night after they lost by a goal to the Anaheim Ducks, the Penguins went down without a fight. Not long after Crosby missed that open net in the third period, Logan Couture put the game away. Joe Thornton’s goal, which went in off Jack Johnson, made it a laugher.</p>
<p>“We just weren’t very good tonight,” Sullivan said. “It’s my responsibility to try to get this team playing to its capabilities.</p>
<p>“I believe in the players we have. I know we’re a much better team than what we showed. And we’ve got to find a way to work together to make that happen.”</p>
<p>Sullivan was asked about the confidence level of the group. Yeah, it’s not at its peak.</p>
<p>“The nice thing about confidence is that you can get it back as quickly as you lose it,” he said. “It starts with one shift and then you’ve got to build on it. We just have to make sure that we, once again, pick ourselves up and make sure we go back to work when we go back home and have the right attitude for the next opportunity.”</p>
<p>The Penguins return to the ice Tuesday, when they host the floundering Ottawa Senators at PPG Paints Arena. That will be their first home game since Feb. 22.</p>
<p>“We [need to] understand it’s not easy to win,” Evgeni Malkin said. “It doesn’t matter against who we play. We’re not helping each other. … We have time. We have [18] games left. It’s a good time to change and fix our problems.”</p>
