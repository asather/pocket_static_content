<h1>Casey, 32 other senators call for $300 million in domestic violence funding</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON —&nbsp;Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., is demanding another $300 million for domestic violence programs, saying the National Domestic Violence Hotline has reported abusers taking advantage of the social distancing guidelines to isolate victims from their friends and family.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey, joined by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, <a href="https://www.casey.senate.gov/download/letter-on-hhs-dv-programs" target="_blank">led a letter</a>&nbsp;to Senate leadership and appropriators, urging them to allocate the funding in the next round of COVID-19 legislation.&nbsp;The letter, signed by a total of 33 senators from both parties, stated that some abusers are believed to be withholding financial resources or even medical aid.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The call for more funding comes amid abuse worries as families and children are cooped up at home, per government health guidelines.&nbsp;About 54 million K-12 students are no longer going to school and high unemployment has ravaged the country, the letter stated.</p>
<p>“Simply put, even though staying home is currently our best way to slow the spread of this deadly virus, home is not a safe place for people who experience domestic violence,”&nbsp;the senators wrote. “As a result, communities around the country are reporting increased demands on victim service providers, which are facing new difficulties and complexities in assisting survivors.”</p>
<p>The senators called for funding for shelters, resource centers and technical assistance to support victims of domestic violence, including an additional $100 million for programs funded by the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act,&nbsp;the primary federal funding source for domestic violence services like&nbsp;Domestic Violence Hotline.</p>
<p>The senators asked for another at least $100 million for the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention to&nbsp;coordinate language-accessible public outreach to hard-to-reach populations. They requested $101 million be set aside for tribes.</p>
<p>Domestic violence advocates praised the letter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“News reports from across the nation and across the globe have documented a significant increase in domestic violence incidences,” said Ruth M. Glenn, president and CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.&nbsp;“Our member programs are telling us that they do not have the resources to serve all of the survivors seeking help.”</p>
<p>Despite the wide support demonstrated in Mr. Casey’s letter, the Republican-controlled Senate has remained gridlocked on upcoming bills. Republicans and Democrats blocked each other’s proposals to replenish a small business loan program last Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congress’ first COVID-19 relief bill, signed into law in early March, lawmakers included $45 million to provide more support to family violence shelters and $2 million for the National Domestic Violence Hotline.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh domestic violence programs reported last week <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/04/09/Domestic-Abuse-hotlines-calls-down-decrease-child-neglect-domestic-violence-housebound/stories/202004080126" target="_blank">a decline in calls</a>. Advocates told the Post-Gazette they believe victims have less time alone to make calls for help or have the incorrect perception that the pandemic has closed the shelters.</p>
