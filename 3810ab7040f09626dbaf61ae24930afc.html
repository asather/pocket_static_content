<h1>Pittsburgh International Airport traffic plunges 89.4%, but some travel is coming back </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Passenger traffic at Pittsburgh International Airport plummeted 89.4% in May, but there are some glimmers of hope amidst the pandemic-related devastation.</p>
<p>The steep decline is actually an improvement over April, when traffic nosedived 96% as air travel all but disappeared as a result of COVID-19 and stay-at-home orders.</p>
<p>In fact, the number of people using the Findlay airport actually tripled — from 32,400 in April to 92,500 in May.</p>
<p>Still, Christina Cassotis, CEO of the Allegheny County Airport Authority, stressed to board members Friday that Pittsburgh International has an arduous journey ahead of it before it gets back to normal.</p>
<p>“We have a long way to go for recovery. So this is directly tied to COVID-19. I want to remind everybody that we were on track ... to a record year,” she said.</p>
<p>“And like every other aviation industry impact, this has been devastating for the airport. But I am confident that we are on our way back, slow as it may be.”</p>
<p>Ms. Cassotis found encouragement not only in the near tripling of passenger totals in May, mostly the result of leisure travel, but in the decision by JetBlue Airways to add nonstops to Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, Florida, in October.</p>
<p>While available seats offered by the airlines in Pittsburgh were down 72% in May, that’s better than airports in peer markets like Cleveland and Cincinnati, which experienced steeper drops.</p>
<p>Ms. Cassotis attributed that to the “diverse mix” of airlines serving the region. Year to date through May, traffic is down 51%, again the result of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The biggest growth has come on the leisure side, which started to trend upward during the latter part of May, Ms. Cassotis said.</p>
<p>That’s reflected in the fact that Allegiant Air, which hauls a lot of leisure passengers, carried 15% of the travelers from Pittsburgh last month. It typically would be carrying 5% to 6% in any given month.</p>
<p>While business travel has been largely sidelined by the coronavirus, one place where there are hopeful signs is at Allegheny County Airport in West Mifflin.</p>
<p>Air taxi operations fell about 17.3% in May, compared to 46.3% in April and 24.2% in March. Interestingly enough, traffic for the last week of May was actually 6% higher than it was for the same week in 2019.</p>
<p>Ms. Cassotis attributed the improvement to an uptick in private corporate travel.</p>
<p>That, she said, mirrors national trends that show the North American business aviation market is experiencing the strongest COVID-19-related recovery.</p>
<p>“Business aviation is recovering faster than commercial aviation when it comes to business travel, and North America is recovering faster than other countries,” she said.</p>
<p>While she doesn’t know why that is the case, she welcomes the improvement — and believes it could be an indication of things to come on the commercial side.</p>
<p>“I believe it signals that people are traveling for business. So that’s a good sign,” she said.</p>
<p>In other matters Friday, the authority board approved an increase of up to $19.9 million in the contract with Gensler + HDR for design work related to the proposed $1.1 billion airport modernization.</p>
<p>It also authorized another $1.7 million to Michael Baker International for design work related to the modernization’s multi-modal complex.</p>
<p>Ms. Cassotis said the spending does not represent increases in design costs but are planned allocations associated with the original contract amounts.</p>
<p>The proposed modernization includes a new terminal for ticketing, baggage handling and security, as well as a new parking garage and road network. The authority is planning to make changes in the design to reflect COVID-19 realities like social distancing.</p>
<p>It had hoped to start construction on the modernization this summer, but that work is on hold indefinitely because of the pandemic. Ms. Cassotis said that probably won’t change until the authority sees a “return to confidence in the market in airport bonds.”</p>
<p>Most airports, including Pittsburgh, have seen their credit outlooks changed from stable to negative because of COVID-19 and the impacts on travel.</p>
<p>The authority plans to float revenue bonds to pay for the project.</p>
<p>They would be repaid through fees and other charges levied on the airlines operating from the airport. The authority is still trying to finalize new long-term leases with the carriers that would take into account the cost of the modernization.</p>
