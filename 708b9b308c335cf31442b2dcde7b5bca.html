<h1>Meadowcroft won't open for regular season, citing pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village said Monday that the National Historic Landmark in Washington County will not open for its 52nd season this week due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The landmark will instead offer online education resources for “virtual visits,” including the use of interactive GigaPan technology available through the Heinz History Center’s History at Home online hub.&nbsp;GigaPan images are large panoramas containing billions of pixels, allowing users to zoom in and examine the subject in detail.</p>
<p>The 16th-century Monongahela Indian Village in Jefferson near Avella was set to open May 2.</p>
<p>It is the oldest site of human habitation in North America and features a massive rock overhang used by the region’s earliest inhabitants for shelter more than 19,000 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virtual visitors can explore the archaeological wonders of the Rockshelter from home using GigaPan images to teach about “the archaeological process employed during the Rockshelter's excavation, the evidence found of the natural and cultural history of the site, and its place in our understanding of prehistoric North America,” officials said.</p>
