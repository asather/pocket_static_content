<h1>DA drops charges against East Liberty protesters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office dropped charges on Thursday against 22 people arrested in connection to the protest that ended violently in East Liberty earlier this month.</p>
<p>The development comes several weeks after the district attorney’s office dropped charges for 39 people arrested at the protests in East Liberty on June 1 and in Downtown Pittsburgh several days prior.</p>
<p>“Until such time as we have evidence that is substantial and relevant, it is not appropriate to move forward with those complaints,” office spokesman Mike Manko said in a statement. “It is important to note that none of the cases in which charges have been withdrawn involves any violence or property damage.”</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto ordered an investigation into police conduct on the June 1 protest two days later.</p>
<p>Defense attorney Lisa Middleman helped organize a group of attorneys to represent the people arrested during the protests, pro-bono. Ms. Middleman and her colleagues declared victory in a statement provided by the group on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mr. Manko also said that charges have not been dropped for two people accused of throwing objects at police, but their preliminary hearings have been rescheduled at the request of their defense attorneys.</p>
