<h1>Woman accused of passing along drugs with a kiss during prison visit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A kiss between a prison inmate and his visitor wasn’t what it appeared to be, authorities said.</p>
<p>Somerset police allege that 21-year-old Jasmine Lanell Livingston of Manchester didn’t have romance on her mind on Jan. 23 when she was arrested for delivering — via a kiss — a tootsie-roll shaped package filled with drugs while visiting her boyfriend at SCI Somerset prison.</p>
<p>According to police, Ms. Livingston held the package in her mouth while visiting Anthony Jackson, 26. During a kiss goodbye, police said she transferred the package from her mouth to his.</p>
<p>Ms. Livingston said she received the package from a friend and was not prescribed the drugs, according to police.</p>
<p>She was charged with possession with intent to deliver and other offenses.</p>
<p>Ms. Livingston was held at Somerset County Jail until she posted a $10,000 bail on Jan. 27. A preliminary trial was originally scheduled for Jan. 30 and has yet to be rescheduled, according to court documents.</p>
<p>According to the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, inmates and their visitors are allowed a “brief kiss and embrace” at the beginning and end of the visitation.</p>
