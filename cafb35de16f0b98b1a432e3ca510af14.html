<html><head><title>Boys basketball rankings: Undefeated Fox Chapel moves to No. 1</title></head><body><p>One of Fox Chapel’s top players has yet to play this season because of an injury. But things are still perfect for Fox Chapel so far.</p><p>Fox Chapel is one of only four perfect teams in the WPIAL heading into the new year, and the Foxes take over the the No. 1 spot in WPIAL Class 6A in this week’s Post-Gazette rankings.</p><p>Fox Chapel’s Sam Brown, a senior guard, figured to be one of the top players in Class 6A this season, but he has missed all nine games because of an injury. He might play in Friday’s game at Hempfield. Even without Brown, Fox Chapel has rolled, winning seven of nine games by 10 points or more.</p><p>Defense has been a major reason for Fox Chapel’s success. Coach Zach Skrinjar’s team is allowing only 42.7 points a game, the best in Class 6A and third-best in the entire WPIAL. Only Eden Christian (42.0) and McGuffey (42.4) give up fewer points.</p><p>Fox Chapel took over the top spot this week from Butler, which had been ranked No. 1 since the preseason. Butler drops to No. 2. Butler lost two games in the C.J. Betters Tournament last week to Lincoln Park and Beaver Falls, but star senior point guard Ethan Morton (Purdue recruit) didn’t play in either game because of an injured ankle. He is expected to play Friday against North Hills.</p><p>Here are the Post-Gazette boys rankings for the entire WPIAL and City League:</p><p><strong>WPIAL CLASS 6A</strong></p><p>1.
