<h1>Keone Kela’s return a good thing for the Pirates’ future</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CHICAGO — The Pirates will soon have their best reliever back.</p>
<p>More importantly, Sunday’s news that Keone Kela finally produced the necessary negative tests for the coronavirus means the Pirates will regain one of their best trade-deadline assets.</p>
<p>Speaking before the series finale against the Cubs at PNC Park, manager Derek Shelton said Kela had been cleared and was working out at PNC Park.</p>
<p>How soon Kela returns to games remains unclear because, as Shelton said, “It’s more just now we have to — because of lost time — get back up to throwing volume, being off the mound, those kinds of things.”</p>
<p>Easily the Pirates’ best reliever, especially now, Kela has not yet pitched this season because of his bout with COVID-19. After testing positive at intake in late June, Kela told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/22/keone-kela-absence-pirates-summer-camp-2020/stories/202007220135" target="_blank">he was never symptomatic</a>.</p>
<p>Kela quarantined for more than three weeks, though he struggled to produce two negative tests at least 24 hours apart, the result of trace amounts of the virus remaining in his system.</p>
<p>Shelton said Sunday that Kela finally had the necessary negative results.</p>
<p>“He produced negative tests,” Shelton said. “He just went through the protocol. It was the negative tests. You have to go through the clearance from our doctors and Major League Baseball’s doctors. It’s just a regular clearance of Major League Baseball and testing."</p>
<p>Adding Kela to the bullpen will obviously help for the 2020 season. In 2019, Kela had a 2.12 ERA with 33 strikeouts and 11 walks in 29⅔ innings. That group has been beset by injuries in 2020, losing Kyle Crick, Michael Feliz and Clay Holmes, plus Edgar Santana to a suspension.</p>
<p>After returning from his second bout with arm issues in 2019, Kela allowed just one run over his final 18 appearances, walking seven and striking out 22.</p>
<p>On an expiring contract and extremely unlikely to re-sign in Pittsburgh, it's a good bet the Pirates will look to trade the talented reliever by the Aug. 31 deadline.</p>
<p>That’s tough, if not impossible, to do while Kela is sidelined. But if he’s able to come back soon and pitch well, the Pirates could flip the 27-year-old for a future building block.</p>
