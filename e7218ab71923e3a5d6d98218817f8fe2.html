<p>Heinz Field will briefly trade in its black-and-gold aesthetic for an all-blue hue Thursday night.</p>
<p>At 8 p.m., the Steelers and Pitt football’s home stadium will join the “more than 150 major sporting and entertainment venues, landmarks and historic buildings, sports, civic and arts organizations” nationwide that are <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200408005720/en/City-Skylines-Communities-Sports-Arenas-Honor-Essential#.Xo41SKTnSNk.twitter" target="_blank">participating in the #LightBlue campaign</a> meant to honor essential workers on the front line of the battle against COVID-19, according to Business Wire.</p>
<p>“We’ve been so inspired over the past few weeks by the cheers of our neighbors around the world — and we wanted to bring this collective gratitude to an even bigger stage here in the U.S.,” Thinkwell Group CEO and lead #LighbtBlue organizer Joe Zenas said in the Business Wire story.</p>
<p>“This is a heartfelt ‘thank you’ from those of us at home to those of us who are going to work each day to keep our country going,” he continued.</p>
<p>Heinz Field will join venues in at least 27 cities in going blue tonight, according to Business Wire. Participating cities include Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>This is the second time this week Heinz Field will light up in a show of solidarity with essential workers. Both it and PNC Park participated in <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/photos/2020/04/07/illumination-ovation-pittsburgh-lights-up-to-thank-frontline-employees/" target="_blank">Tuesday’s “Illumination Ovation” event</a> with the same purpose, flashing the campaign’s #LOVEFROMPGH message on one of its scoreboards.</p>
