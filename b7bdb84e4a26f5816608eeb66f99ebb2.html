<p>Mayor Bill Peduto is recommending the removal of the controversial statue of Christopher Columbus from its home in Schenley Park.</p>
<p>In making the recommendation that the statue be removed to a&nbsp;“new and private home,” Mr. Peduto is following the recommendation of the Pittsburgh Arts Commission, which reached the same conclusion after holding a public hearing on the question last month. The five-member commission <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/09/23/Pittsburgh-Arts-Commission-Christopher-Columbus-statue-remove-schenley-park/stories/202009230127" target="_blank">unanimously recommended the removal of the statue Sept. 23</a>.</p>
<p>In a letter to the commission, Mr. Peduto said the statue, which was erected in 1958, would be returned to the city’s Italian-American community</p>
<p>“After much thought and prayer I believe it is now time for us to return the Columbus statue to the Italian-American&nbsp; community that brought it into existence. They can preserve it in a manner than celebrates Italian-American culture, while acknowledging the wreckage that slavery and racism has done to America.”</p>
<p>The statue was vandalized in 2010, 2017, and twice more this year. An online petition calling for its removal gathered more than 14,000 signatures.</p>
