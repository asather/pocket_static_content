<h1>Flamingos and bats featured in new National Aviary program</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Exotic pigeons mingle with visitors, vividly hued flamingos dance and strut, and bats display their five-foot&nbsp; wing span in the new&nbsp;“Escape to the Islands” program at the National Aviary.</p>
<p>“Rare and vibrant” birds and bats&nbsp;“from islands around the globe” are featured in the program that runs through May 22 at the North Side facility.</p>
<p>Two Victoria Crowned Pigeons take what the staff calls a&nbsp;“royal stroll” at 11 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;Native to New Guinea, they’ve been practicing for weeks, walking from their Tropical Rainforest habitat and through the halls of the Canary’s Call, amidst delighted children and other visitors.</p>
<p>Visitors can feed and get close to 10 orangeish-pink birds in The Flamingo Island Adventure at 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m. in the Wetlands habitat. Though they’re called American flamingos, they are native to the Galapagos and Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>“Hang with the Bats” is what the Aviary calls the 3 p.m. program with four Malayan Flying Foxes. The mammals, native to islands throughout Southeast Asia, have been trained to open their leathery wings when asked to do so by Cathy Schlott, curator of behavioral management and animal programs.&nbsp; She trains birds in all the aviary programs and shows. Because bats are nocturnal, they usually sleep during the day, with wings tucked.</p>
<p>Feeding times for the little African penguins are at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. They’re endangered in their native habitat , which includes islands off the coast of South Africa.</p>
<p>“Escape to the Islands” is included with admission, which is adults $17, children 2-12 $16, seniors 60+ $16, Access card holders $2. Children under 2 get in for free.</p>
<p>The National Aviary is at 700 Arch St., Pittsburgh 15212. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days per week.</p>
