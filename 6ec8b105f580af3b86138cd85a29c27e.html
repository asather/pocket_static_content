<h1>'This guy is in the NFL?': Surinamese Steelers rookie hopes to be</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Corliss Waitman traveled to Suriname back in February, a visit to the <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/suriname/overview/" target="_blank">smallest country in South America</a> and one of the poorest. His maternal grandparents had died within days of each other, making it an unfortunate trip for a self-proclaimed Floridian who spends time in his mother’s homeland as often as he can.</p>
<p>“It was kind of a heavy week,” Waitman was saying last week as he sat in the stands looking out over Heinz Field. “They got buried together on Valentine’s Day. It’s a beautiful thing, but it was a sad thing at the same time.”</p>
<p>Nearly three months later, happier times awaited Waitman in the form of a phone call from Danny Smith, the Steelers’ special teams coordinator. A coach who grew up in Point Breeze was offering a punter born in Belgium the chance to sign as an undrafted free agent, making the NFL — or at least a shot at it — the next step in what’s been a journey through three countries, two languages and one life-changing loss.</p>
<p>Meet Waitman, a Belgian-born, Netherlands-raised, Surinamese left-footed punter who last played two years ago at South Alabama and is also a 25-year-old rookie competing for a roster spot. He’s also a Black punter, and trying to become <a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/in-football-its-harder-to-find-a-black-kicker-than-a-black-qb/" target="_blank">one of just a few in league history</a>&nbsp;to play in the regular season. Other than that, he’s just your typical NFL hopeful.</p>
<p>“I think I might be the first Surinamese player in the NFL,” Waitman said, not exactly going out on a limb. “I’m not 100% sure, but when I did get my shot as an undrafted free agent, they were over there in the newspapers <a href="https://www.waterkant.net/suriname/2020/04/26/american-football-speler-corliss-waitman-tekent-bij-pittsburgh-steelers/" target="_blank">like I got drafted</a>. They were like, ‘What the heck? This guy is in the NFL?’ ”</p>
<p>Not just yet. But coming this close is already one unique story.</p>
<p><strong>‘Hey, whoa, this is different’</strong></p>
<p>Waitman’s route to football isn’t all that unusual. Like many pro kickers and punters, he started off focused on soccer, then fell in love with America’s favorite sport. But he had better reason than most to be a late-comer to kicking.</p>
<p>His father, Jose Waitman, played college basketball at South Alabama, then carved out a pro career overseas. Jose was in Belgium when Corliss was born but spent most of his career in the Netherlands, where he met Adolphine Chaar and started a family. Corliss and his sisters would spend each summer with their dad’s side of the family in the Florida Panhandle and moved stateside permanently when Corliss was 15. Jose Waitman <a href="https://www.al.com/sports/2014/08/dads_memory_lessons_serve_as_e.html" target="_blank">died in 2013</a>, but he passed on his athletic gifts to his son, who uses them in an uncommon way.</p>
<p>Corliss played hoops, too, at Milton High School, but he blossomed as a kicker and punter — even if he may not look the part.</p>
<p>“I would be lying if I said it isn’t different, you know? When you’re in high school going to camps and you’re the only Black guy there, everybody’s looking at you like, ‘Hey, whoa, this is different,’ ” Waitman said. “It still is different.”</p>
<p>He points out that there’s only one other Black specialist in an NFL camp at the moment, Kaare Vedvik, a punter/kicker who’s half-Nigerian, half-Norwegian and was cut by Buffalo last week before signing with Carolina a day later. Vedvik kicked in one game last season for the Jets, but for the six years before that, Marquette King was a football oddity.</p>
<p>When Waitman started getting serious about punting in high school, King was breaking onto the scene in the NFL — an undrafted punter, a rookie and from a small school in Division II Fort Valley State, a historically Black university in Georgia.</p>
<p>Naturally, King became Waitman’s favorite athlete. So, Waitman did what a lot of ambitious teenagers would and reached out via social media. King responded and the two have kept in touch occasionally ever since. Waitman has researched the other Black punters in NFL history, from Greg Coleman to Rodney Williams to Reggie Roby, a two-time All-Pro.</p>
<p>“Your favorite player, you’re going to try to find a player you can really relate with. In high school, I could really relate with Marquette King,” Waitman said. “To me, I think I’m in a perfect situation because I’ve been in different countries, lived in different neighborhoods. I’ve always been a multicultural guy, so it’s easy for me to fit in anywhere and feel comfortable.”</p>
<p>That includes Pittsburgh. One of his favorite interactions in the locker room has been with a most unlikely teammate — at least on the surface.</p>
<p>Somehow, the 6-foot-2, 205-pound undrafted punter got to chatting with the 6-9, 320-pound starting left tackle. Alejandro Villanueva just so happens to be a Hispanic two-time Pro Bowler who learned to play football in Belgium.</p>
<p>“He could not believe that I was born in Belgium. I told him I speak Dutch; his mind was blown,” Waitman laughed. “He was like, ‘Bro, you’re my best friend now.’ ”</p>
<p><strong>Uphill battle</strong></p>
<p>First, Waitman has to make the team. Jordan Berry is back after spending the past five seasons as not just the Steelers punter but also the holder for kicker Chris Boswell. If any Steelers long shot could’ve made great use of a preseason, it just might be Berry’s competition, because Waitman has been patient.</p>
<p>Last year, Waitman was ruled ineligible at Mississippi State. He redshirted his freshman year at South Alabama, then played in just two games his second season <a href="https://www.pnj.com/story/sports/2020/04/26/milton-punter-corliss-waitman-signs-pittsburgh-steelers/3030019001/" target="_blank">because of a torn ACL</a>, so he thought he’d be good to get a waiver as a graduate transfer. But the NCAA didn’t approve his sixth year of eligibility, which means it’s been 641 days since Waitman kicked in a real game. He won’t have the opportunity to do so for a Steelers staff that still thought enough of his 42.7 yards per punt in college to bring him here.</p>
<p>“It would’ve been nice, but I try to not think like that,” Waitman said of missing out on the preseason, which is how Berry won the job five summers ago. “I try to just control what I can control, because at the end of the day, these coaches are going to help create environments to where they can see how we respond in pressure situations.”</p>
<p>Smith, Mike Tomlin’s special teams coordinator since 2013, didn’t mince words last week when he admitted it would take “a lot” for a newcomer to outdo the incumbent in these circumstances. Waitman feels a lot of eyes on him every time he and Berry alternate punts during a special teams period in practice, which is about all the coaches have to go on this year.</p>
<p>And there might be even more attention paid when Boswell lines up for field goals on the same grass he’ll kick from for half of the season. While on one hand it works in Waitman’s favor that he doesn’t have much of a playbook to learn or a significant physical adjustment to make like other rookies — “You either can punt or you can’t; it’s not hard to evaluate that,” he said — the snap-hold-kick rhythm is as crucial as any timing on a football field, and it’s a chemistry that comes with experience.</p>
<p>“Shoot, [with punting] you’re just talking about a portion of the issues relative to sorting that out. How about the holding element of it, as well, which is also a component of the job?” Tomlin said last week. “That’s the challenge that we’re all faced with. There’s a lot of those battles in terms of the division of labor that’s worrisome in this environment. We will push through it.”</p>

<p><strong>Soaking it in</strong></p>
<p>Each day that passes could bring the end of Waitman’s time in Pittsburgh, if Smith and Tomlin decide he won’t unseat Berry. But even making it to Aug. 25 might be a good sign, considering the team has cut more than a dozen players since the start of camp, including 10 just to get down to the 80-man reduced roster size.</p>
<p>Perhaps Waitman has survived this long because it helps to have an extra specialist in the mix, but there’s no backup kicker to Boswell, no No. 2 long-snapper to Kameron Canaday. This is the third year in a row the Steelers added a punter to push Berry, who had the second-lowest percentage of kicks that landed inside the 20-yard line in 2019 and is in the last season of a two-year deal.</p>
<p>“Realistically, just to be straightforward, of course it’s easier to cut a rookie specialist when you have to make cuts,” Waitman said. “I don’t really want to look into that too much, am I a ‘camp leg.’ All I can do is be the best, most consistent punter I can be, learn from these veteran guys, and soak it in.</p>
<p>“I just watch them. I watch Boswell, I watch Jordan, I watch Kam — how they move around the facility, their routine. They might not notice it, but I’m soaking all that in. They’ve been in the league for years, so why would I not do that? Anything they tell me, I’m writing that down. They don’t even know it, but I’m taking notes.”</p>
<p>That will serve Waitman well, because even if he loses the battle with Berry, he could stick around on an expanded practice squad in 2020. The NFL increased the numbers to 16 players per team, and it could help to keep a specialist employed here and there.</p>
<p>Waitman has been to nearly 10 countries, lived in three, saw his college career end unexpectedly and buried his father at 48. It all drives him, and he realizes what a rarity he’d be if he succeeds.</p>
<p>“Especially being a left-footed Black punter. I don’t know <em>any</em>,” he chuckled. “That’s probably the kicker right there.”</p>
<p>No, that’s the punter. The one who pulled on a No. 8 Steelers jersey with his name on the back Saturday night under the lights in an NFL stadium, even if it was just for a practice.</p>
<p>“You know, it’s funny when people say, ‘Do you stop and think?’ When I didn’t get to play, I could really stop and think,” Waitman said. “So many hurdles I went through, so many different countries, different settings I’ve been in, and I end up being here. It hasn’t been an easy road, but it was for a reason. I’m here now, and it feels great.”</p>
