<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 04.29.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ok, kids, we're going to start our chat soon so get those questions ready...I see several lined up already, as though Costco just got a shipment of hand sanitizer. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ok, everyone, let's get started....</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: I would give our draft and A+. Our #1 draft choice is already an All-Pro and should be for the next 10-12 years. I don't think any other team can match that. Do you think they will give out #83 to our new WR? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think you are being a bit presumptious about the All-Pro stuff, but I do think the guy has tremendous amount of potential to be very good because of his size, speed and production. This isn't Limas Sweed after all.</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: do you think ben will play the entire season or will he fail in his comeback, even though he wasn't that good anyway? only 3 playoff wins in 11 years doesn't seem too good to me !! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yeah, he was terrible. Next.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong>: Some Steeler fans are bemoaning the fact that the Raven had so many draft picks, which seems great for them. However there are only so many spots on the roster. Perhaps a good player or two could be cut and fall into our laps. Any thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I really don't think they are specifically monitoring the Ravens cuts, if that's what you mean. But if you mean they will monitor every team's cut and maybe get a player or two, well, they do that every year with every team.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Is Samuels the odd man out this year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think Kerrith Whyte might be.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Who do you think starts at LG &amp; RT? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Wisniewski and Feiler.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Is Wormley &amp; Alualu going to rotate at DT to replace Hargrave? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes, that's the plan. I think Wormley is a nice pickup. I don't think he's Hargrave, but I think he will be a good sub-package DE</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Not that I thought he was ever coming to Pittsburgh, but Jameis Winston said he signed with the Saints to get a 'Harvard education' in QB play. What kind of rep do you think Coach Randy has in the league for QB knowledge? He's been around the block plenty of times. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't know about how Fichtner is viewed, but what Winston is referring to, of course, is learning under Sean Payton and Drew Brees. I do not think Fichtner has been around the block a few times, at least, not in the NFL. He has never worked for another NFL team other than the Steelers.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Gerry doesn’t looks strange to you the NE Cheaters didn’t really do anything or tried hard to get any QB during draft or Free Agency so Far? Only Dalton &amp; Newton Left by the way.. I think this Cheaters are going to Cheat again for Trevor Lawrence and finish bad record this year.. enough to trade up to # one.. for me that is Cheating.. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Now THAT is a conspiracy theory. It's also preposterous.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: How realistic do you think we could have a NFL season with no fans in the stadiums? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Realistic enough that it has been discussed. If the season starts in September, as planned, I think it's a good possibility. But they're talking about delaying the start of the season until October, and that would be because of the fans.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Gerry, who is going to fill Mark Barron’s role on this team? It sure hopefully will not be their 6th round pick. Vince Williams is their run down LB. Is it UG3? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm with you Matt. That question has not been answered, at least, not as of now. I think you might see Marcus Allen get moved into that role and see how he performs. Gilbert is a possibility, too. They don't Vince Williams playing in their sub packages.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L</strong>: I don’t have a sister, but the Steelers draft kind of equates to to kissing her. That said, do you know why WR Mims fell? And, how in the world is it that every Ravens’ pick represented pure gold falling into their laps? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't know why Mims fell. Maybe he had a bad medical or something. As for the Ravens, I like their first two picks, especially Queen, but remember, they had a first-round pick and the Steelers did not. Let's say the Steelers had a first-round pick and they drafted, say, Jonathan Taylor, and then Claypool, and then Highsmith. Or they took Claypool (Kevin Colbert really wanted him) with a No. 1, then Dobbins, then Highsmith. All of a sudden everyone would think it was a tremendous draft.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Jane</strong>: Gerry we know drafts should be at least 2 or 3 years to judge.. I think ours was fine given the circumstances.. However the Ravens draft on paper looks honestly as the best I’ve seen in a long time and I mean it .. very deep and scary honestly.. Ten great picks too to bottom.. What say you? Thanks.. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Like you said MJ, I'll wait 2-3 years.</p>
<p><strong>grovecity_blackandgold</strong>: I always worry about kicking the salary cap down the road. No doubt that plays into the Steelers ability to bring in veteran help/depth. Then again, the Winston number was not exorbitant. Would the Steelers consider bringing in McCoy even to compete at RB? What about Alex Smith as an option as a backup QB? Are we no longer permitted to negotiate with Barron at ILB? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: At this point, there will be no LeSean McCoy. And they will not go back and re-sign Barron. The guy practiced one day a week all season because of injuries and never got comfortable in their defense. And, I'll say it again for the 50th time, the Steelers are NOT signing a veteran QB such as the ones everyone is suggesting unless -- UNLESS -- they get to August and see that Ben is not going to be ready for the season. And there is absolutely no evidence right now -- NONE -- that is or will be the case. So the next Cam Newton question, I promise, will have a much shorter answer than this one.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: The Steelers need to sign Cam Newton to back up Big Ben for sure this Year <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: And there you go....</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: I have no issue with McFarland as a player or a person but why do the Steelers keep throwing mid round picks at RB when they disdain the ground game to begin with? Who is he going to take snaps from and how many per game is he actually going to get? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not going to argue with you Scott. Do you remember Dri Archer and Chris Rainey?</p>
<p><strong>Lamberto58</strong>: Still no "true" nose tackle? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nope, which tells you how much they value one with the way they play defense anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: What new rules or tweaks to rules are in effect once , and if, the season gets started ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's still to be determined whenever the owners meet again. Those are usually done in March at the annual meeting and it was cancelled.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Gerry I dont understand the negativity towards the Steelers offseason, we got stronger at TE and FB are only major loss was Hargrave, we drafted a big WR, potential starters at OLB and G and added depth, what am I missing? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You're missing nothing. Ebron was a big signing for them. However, Claypool and Dotson are potential starters, but not now. Especially with no OTAs and maybe not even preseason games, certainly not all four (or five).</p>
<p><strong>Jake</strong>: Gerry, I know the Steeler's FO has been saying they are happy with their backup QB situation, but that is hard to believe. If Ben cannot go full speed they are trouble. With what Mason went thru last season he may never be right. They have to have some other options in place. How do you see it? Thank you. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I do not think Mason Rudolph is as bad as people want to think he is. He had never played in an NFL game, went 5-3 as a starter and, yes, wemnt through some very difficult times because of the knockout concussion against the Ravens, the Myles Garrett incident and the potentially very serious shoulder injury against the NYJ. Give the kid a break. 5-3 over a full season translates to 10-6 and that's good enough for the postseason. It is not fgair to expect him to be Ben.</p>
<p><strong>SteelfanSLC</strong>: Is Paul Zeise running out material? The majority of the guys hes calling busts at WR were 7th round picks, I get the Sweed and Coates arguments but the rest? To steal a line from MNF Come on man. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Sweed never had any kind of production at Texas, certainly not like Claypool. And Coates had issues, which is why he was drafted 87 th overall, nearly 40 spots lower than Claypool. Did you say he's running out of material???</p>
<p><strong>Mike J.</strong>: Who do you think will be the starting defensive tackle? Feel like that is the biggest question mark after the draft <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, when they are in their 3-4 defense, it will be Alualu as of right now.</p>
<p><strong>GPT</strong>: Claypool over Akers and Dobbins. Would you have, and why did the Steelers? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Because they had a much higher grade on Claypool than those other guys. Now, if they had a No. 1 pick, they might have still taken Claypool and then they could have used a No. 2 on Dobbins or Akers</p>
<p><strong>fredward</strong>: Are you surprised the Steelers went with Claypool over Dobbins or Akers in the draft? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>Go Matt</strong>: Due to the lack of depth at ILB, do you think Highsmith could help there? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nope. He's not an inside guy, he's an edge guy</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: I believe martyv was referring to Minkah as our first round pick. He has indeed been voted All Pro once already. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ahhhh....</p>
<p><strong>NYCJOHN</strong>: what do you think of addressing the running back need in the fourth round and not in the second round? Also what our your thoughts on basically not addressing inside linebacker. Thanks! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm a little surprised they didn't take an ILB, but I will say that was part of their thought when they took Brooks, a hybrid LB/S, on the sixth (remember, they didn't have a fifth). Look, they had six draft picks, their fewest since 2003. You can only address so many things.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: Shouldnt Tom Brady be penalized for meeting face to face with Leftwich? Whatever happened with the Patriots spying on the Bengals last year? I guess it is all being swept under the rug. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: By whom? The police? The league?</p>
<p><strong>Hoops McCann</strong>: Gerry - which new player, of the FA’s and draft picks will have the biggest impact this season and who has the highest upside? Ty! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think the easy answer is Claypool of the draft picks. But, of all the players, I think Ebron will have the biggest impact.</p>
<p><strong>NYCJOHN</strong>: How do you think our outside linebacker group compares to last year? I feel like it is stronger with the highsmith addition, I feel like chickolo was more special teams. Would love to hear your thoughts. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think Highsmith will be much better than what Chickillo gave them. They overpaid for him two years ago. Plus, I think Adeniyi will develop a little more too.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry</strong>: Is it true that Kevin Colbert offered AR to resign but that Rooney talked him into staying another two years? What happens at Ben's two year end? does Colbert and Tomlin move on do you think? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Where did you hear that nonsense? From the same yahoo who reported Steelers offered Winston a much bigger deal than Saints but he turned it down?</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: What percentage of plays was Barron on the field for the defense? Seems that the rookie Brooks or Allen or one of the other sub-LBs could pick up the slack without much issue... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Barron was on the field for nearly 70 percent of the plays (750 snaps). Only Bush played more among the ILBs. Well, there would be a very big issue for Allen and especially Brooks -- learning the position in the Steelers defense.</p>
<p><strong>Mike M</strong>: Were there any running backs that if they fell the Steelers at pick 49, the Steelers would have drafted no matter what? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Maybe Jonathan Taylor. Maybe D'Andre Swift. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Gerry - who is the backup center now with Finney gone? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's still to be determined. I don't think he's on the roster just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Zack B.</strong>: Seems to me that ILB ans safety depth is a concern. Do you think we would bring in a vet or trade for a higher pedigree player that didnt work out for another team? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, their track record for signing that hybrid LB type the past two years -- Bostic, Burnett, Barron -- have not exactly turned out to be the Killer B's. This is part of the problem with no OTAs -- they cannot get an early look at what they have or don't have at those spots before going to training camp.</p>
<p><strong>TX Steeler</strong>: Think we start looking at someone like Clay Matthews now? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think Matthews has the speed to play the inside position the way they would like.</p>
<p><strong>Cade</strong>: What do you think is the biggest need for the Steelers after the draft? And do you think they will address this need before the season begins? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they still have to determine who is going to be their inside linebacker when they don't use Vince Williams in run situations. Brooks would seem to be the ideal guy because he is part safety, part linebacker, but let's not forget he was a sixth-round pick, probably because teams weren't convinced he could excel at either position.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Gerry - who is the starting NT when they are in the base defense now? I know he is a 7th rounder, but is that something Carlos Davis grow into in a year or two? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Right now it's Tyson Alualu. Yes, Davis could grow into that position, literally, but his greatest asset is his speed and athleticism, and I don't think they want to compromise that with 15-20 extra pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Seattle Art</strong>: If there were no season this year, would next years draft stay in the same order and would we have a 1st round draft choice, all things being equal? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There will be a season.</p>
<p><strong>ZO</strong>: Surely Switzer has to be the odd man out in the WR Room! Correct? I mean the man looked like he was wearing cement boots once he caught the ball last year before he got hurt. At least Cain has pedigree and upside. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I like Cain. He's more than able.</p>
<p><strong>Buzzard Bill</strong>: It sure appears that the Steelers have rolled the dice on the 2020 season with their draft picks all playing support roles for a playoff run involving a healthy BR. If Ben goes down, do you see some blowback among fans who feel they should have addressed the backup QB issue? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Blowback from fans? Second-guessing? Nah, would never happen.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: I’m still struggling to understand why Duck, Big Dan and Switzer are still on the roster? They may be good teammates but I see no impact and low ceilings. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Relax, the season hasn't started yet.</p>
<p><strong>BIG TEX</strong>: Can Buggs get snaps at DT? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Colin</strong>: What about looking at a guy like Hassan Riddick? AZ is trying to get rid of him. Another idea would be a big safety like Eric Reid. There are trade or FA options. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There are always options.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: To follow-up, The learning curve would be a real hurdle, but my bigger point was a that plan of replacement tailored to the strengths of multiple players for given situations seems like a direction Tomlin and company might go. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Agreed. And I'm sure they have a plan. I hate to tell you this, but they know more about football than you and me.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Now that FA signings don’t count against the comp pick formula, signing a serviceable vet at ILB seems fairly obvious if they like who’s out there? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think the new comp pick policy has anything to do with who they sign or when, or even if they do.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: One thought I had was they drafted Edmunds instead of an ILB the year after Shazier was injured. It turned out poorly and then the following year they scrambled to make up for it with the Devin Bush.<br> I feel this year is very similar with the Safety Hybrid they picked instead of an ILB...Again. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, Edmunds was never drafted to be a Shazier or Bush-type player. He was drafted as a strong safety, not a hyrbid linebacker. There is no comparison between Brooks and Him.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Will Andy Dalton be released? Would be a nice backup if the price was right. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: If Ben is unable to play.....perhaps. I still think he's headed to NE.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Hi Gerry...it’s my understanding that the Steelers really liked Travis Etienne and were disappointed when he chose to return to Clemson. Do you think Etienne may be a viable option in next year’s draft? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: And, Jordan, who told you that? Hey, I like Travis Etienne, too. He could be their top pick next year.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: percentage chance JJ Watt plays for the Steelers at some point? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You have a better chance.</p>
<p><strong>Jake</strong>: Gerry, Do you think another punter will be signed before camp? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They always do.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: I hope Colbert didn't want Claypool because of the ND connection, a school which doesn't regularly put ou all pros? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think he wanted him because he really liked him, no matter what school he played for. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: And, yeah, that Tuitt's a bum, too.</p>
<p><strong>Zack B.</strong>: Wasnt big on signing Winston, but just read he signed for 1.1 million. Hell, I would have signed him for that. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yeah, he was a WalMart special at that price.</p>
<p><strong>Lamberto58</strong>: wouldn't a walk on free agent from a div 2 school be a better option than mccullers?? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Certainly Carlos Davis is. He at least has a chance to develop. That ship has sailed -- or should I say barge -- with McCullers. Did I ever mention he's had 41 tackles in six seasons?? That's combined now.</p>
<p><strong>Hugh DeMann</strong>: Sounds like they were so enamored with Claypool, they never considered trading down out of 49 to get an extra pick? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That is correct. But they tried to trade into the fifth round.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: 10 WRs taken before Claypool. Did they reach ... and does it really matter if they did? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They don't think so. They were gonna take him if only 5 wide receivers were taken ahead of him. Maybe only 4. It was not a reach on their part.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Lynn</strong>: Hey Gerry, love the chats. Would an abbreviated nfl season or no season at all affect the salary cap when play is resumed? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't know the answer to that. It won't affect the cap this season.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Gerry - what do you see as the Steelers biggest need after FA and the Draft? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: ILB</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: See anymore lower level free agent moves that make sense? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, I think they're done there for now because there are no OTAs and who knows when there might even be training camp -- that is, the new shortened version of training camp. I don't see any way conceivable they will go to Saint Vincent College this year. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, kids, that's all the time we have today. Thanx for the questions.</p>
