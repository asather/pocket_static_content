<h1>California Gov. Newsom says science, not political will, dictates when state can reopen</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The governor of California, the first state to put a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/world/coronavirus-outbreak-intl-hnk" target="_blank">coronavirus</a> stay-at-home order in place, told his 40 million residents that the key to going back to work and play depends on six factors -- but it's still too early to tell how soon that will be.</p>
<p>"Science, not politics must be the guide," <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/politics/california-economy-coronavirus-newsom/index.html" target="_blank">Gov. Gavin Newsom said</a>, joining a growing number of states that are taking it upon themselves to figure out how to get back to normal. "We can't get ahead of ourselves .... I don't want to make a political decision. That puts people's lives at risk."</p>
<p>Newsom's remarks Tuesday come as the death toll from the coronavirus in the United States passed 25,000 -- according to Johns Hopkins University -- and as governors across the county discuss the options for reopening businesses and schools in their states.</p>

<p>There have been signs that the US is nearing the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/13/health/us-coronavirus-updates-monday/index.html" target="_blank">peak of its coronavirus outbreak</a>, with the number of deaths reported each day and the number of new cases leveling off. Tuesday was a step back, though, with a record number of 2,353 Covid-19 deaths reported.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has social distancing guidelines in effect through the end of the month. President Donald Trump said Tuesday it will be up to the governors when to reopen but he thought the federal government would give a date to them. Some states might open before April 30, he predicted.</p>
<p>California officials during this phase of the pandemic are looking toward means of Covid-19 suppression, herd immunity and, ultimately, a vaccine, but it will be "perhaps the most difficult and challenging phase of all," Newsom said.</p>
<p>The governor said that was saying a lot because the phase that has brought 734 deaths and new cases was very challenging.</p>
<p>Herd immunity is when so many people in the community have had the virus and become immune that it largely prevents further spread.</p>
<p>The new parameters Newsom outlined Tuesday suggested the state must meet a high bar before walking back the order.</p>
<p>Newsom emphasized that reopening schools is the priority.</p>
<p>"We need to get our kids back to school. I need to get my kids back to school," he said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>The governor said he doesn't envision any mass gatherings at sporting events or concerts until there is a vaccine and sufficient herd immunity.</p>
<p>The six things that need to happen before a stay-at-home order is lifted involve the state's ability to: expand testing and track the infected, protect vulnerable people, meet the needs of medical caregivers during the most trying times, to have drugs for treatment, to have businesses and schools comply with social distancing, and to be able to reinstate a stay-at-home order, if need be.</p>
<p>Newsom told reporters to check with him in two weeks to see whether he had a better idea on a timeline for reopening.</p>
<p>California is part of a compact with Oregon and Washington that is looking at how to reopen. The leaders in those three contiguous West Coast states and in seven Northeastern states said they would <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/13/politics/states-band-together-reopening-plans/index.html" target="_blank">regionally plan an incremental release</a> of stay-at-home orders.</p>
<p>By Tuesday, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/" target="_blank">more than 608,000 cases of the virus</a> had been reported in the US. At least 25,992 people have died.</p>
