<h1>Wiz Khalifa's hypeman Chevy Woods tells his story on debut album</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Like just about everyone else on the planet, Chevy Woods isn’t having the 2020 he planned.</p>
<p>When the pandemic hit in March, he was on tour with Wiz Khalifa, for whom he’s played hypeman for more than a decade.</p>
<p>But this was also the year when, after a string of mixtapes and the “48 Hunnid” EP, Woods was set to roll out his long-awaited full-length debut album and be out there to back it up.</p>
<p>With touring out of the picture, “Since Birth,” out Friday, is there to speak for itself, and it does that in commanding fashion. Through 13 songs, written over the last three years, the 38-year-old Hazelwood rapper who first hit the streets as Kev Tha Hustla unveils his story, from gangsta life (“Switch Sides,” “Gang Wit Us”) to international success (“Make It Last”), with some hints on how he got there (“Game Winner”).</p>
<p>Woods’ rap game has long been intertwined with his street life. Coming out of South High School, he got his first shot with an athletic scholarship at Robert Morris University. That didn’t work out, as he’ll explain in this interview, and a year later, he was back in Hazelwood, hustling and selling CDs out of his trunk.</p>
<p>His second shot came when he met the young Khalifa in the mid-’00s. They formed Taylor Gang in 2008. Now, they live a short drive from each other in LA and hook up regularly for their studio work and worldwide touring.</p>
<p>Wiz drops in on the song “Alive,” Tdot Illdude helps out on the title track and that’s it for the features. The rest of “Since Birth” is Woods taking the listener into his world, with production from RMB Justize, Sledgren, Yak Beats, Yung Lan, Ke On The Track, ID Labs, Soul Professa and Ty Made It.</p>
<p>Along the way, he pays homage to lost friends, including Nipsey Hussle and Mac Miller, and addresses Black Lives Matter with “Hands on the Dashboard,” a police encounter reminiscent of Jay-Z’s on “99 Problems,” but one that’s very real to him.</p>
<p>This week, we caught up with Woods at his home in California, where he’s been sheltering and also shooting cooking videos for his YouTube channel.</p>
<p><strong>So, what’s <em>your</em> year been like?</strong></p>
<p>[laughs] Like everyone else. Being in the house is kind of easy for me, because I just do my cooking and if I gotta chill, I play video games. Being in the house is the easy part. So, I’m cool with the quarantine. Not being able to go out to see people and touch people and let people live with the album is a bit difficult.</p>
<p><strong>What was your year <em>going to be</em> like?</strong></p>
<p>Amazing. Still is, because I’m dropping my first album, but, at the same time, I didn’t celebrate my birthday, was quarantined. But I don’t know. I deal with it, day by day. I’m not one of those people who’s like, “Damn, man, everything’s f--ed up.” I just deal with it day by day. I”m not overwhelmed by it.</p>
<p><strong>So, you do some great work on “Since Birth.” How do you differentiate this from the mixtapes that you’ve done?</strong></p>
<p>I think with mixtapes, me and you talking right now, I could literally get off the phone and go make a mixtape in a day. I could walk in, pick the beats I want and just rap over them and not write anything down. With the album, it’s like me putting pen and paper together with my emotions instead of just rap-rap-rap. It actually has content in it that went on in my real life. I wanted to wait for this platform to release those feelings, so now that we’re here, people are going to hear — not that they didn’t hear the real me before — but my story, I thought I should wait to tell it for the big platform.</p>
<p><strong>So, what did you want to communicate on this record?</strong></p>
<p>Me being with Wiz and him being one of my best friends is like, they look at his superstar status and then they try to connect me to that by saying “Oh, this ain’t this, this ain’t that, this sounds like so and so.” There are only two features because I wanted to get across that I can stand on my own, but that’s my dog and we’ll do anything for each other. People think it’s a negative that he’s my friend and say, “You only got put on because of him,” but I’ll tell you right now, if I wasn’t doing hard work, he wouldn’t do what he does. If I was f---ing up, he wouldn’t be at this point.</p>
<p><strong>The street stuff on the album. How much is that written from personal experience?</strong></p>
<p>I’m from Hazelwood. I’m sure you know what goes on. It’s dangerous. It’s ‘hood. I was in the streets for a good while after college. And I was still in music when I was in the streets years ago, but now it’s just like cold- turkey, full-on music, expressing the stuff I went through.</p>
<p><strong>“Hands on the Dashboard” really speaks to the moment. What was the origin of that?</strong></p>
<p>That was written in 2017 when all the police brutality started coming into play. It’s always been in play, but now it’s on the TV, so you see it. And I had to go back and get that record and I played it for my manager and he was just like, “Go! This is for right now. We gonna get this mixed up and do everything we got to do to put it out.” And it was perfect timing. And I told him with the proceeds, we’re still looking for a foundation or something to put that towards. I wanted to do something different with that record because it wasn't just for me. I did that out of my heart instead of just for cash.</p>
<p><strong>What is your reaction to what you’re seeing right now on the streets?</strong></p>
<p>As far as being black in America, this is nothing new. It's just on the TVs and phones now. You can pull your phone out and record this s--t and cops have video cameras on their vests, so now it's just televised. Of course, we used to hear about it. You might get the cases here and there that pop up on the news and you see it, but now you can turn on Instagram and Twitter and everybody's advocating about it and it's just right in your face.</p>
<p><strong>Was it something that you went through a lot personally living in Hazelwood or even now in LA?</strong></p>
<p>Not in LA so much now, but in Hazelwood, yeah, because the police officers and the task forces that come out there, they're out there every damn day. They're not even trying to build a positive rapport with people. They're trying to build a negative rapport with people and just see how many times they can catch you doing something or bothering you. You could just be riding down the street and they know your car and they just pull you over just because they think you live on the drug block and your selling drugs, But I have plenty of friends that are like high-skills businessmen that I hang with and they used to come to the neighborhood and chill and stuff like that, and it's like, everybody’s not that way and you’re harassing people. You're gonna get a different side of people when you go about it that way.</p>
<p><strong>You throw a bunch of references on here, like Jay Z. Seems like he was a big influence on you. Is that something you and Wiz share?</strong></p>
<p>I think so. I think so. It was just that it was a different time in music that we listened to Jay Z. For me, it was “Reasonable Doubt” and all the way up from there. I mean Wiz is younger than me, so he probably still listens to ‘Reasonable Doubt,’ but he probably got Jay Z when it was “The Dynasty” album. So, it's like different times with different people, and that stuff just spoke to me in my street life when I was coming up.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, people probably think that you and Wiz like went to Taylor Allderdice High School together.</strong></p>
<p>They definitely do. You know what's funny: People never ask me my age. They just know that we came up together on the internet, so obviously we went to school together and we hung together, we’re the same age, we got the same friends. They think everything is the same.</p>
<p><strong>So, going way back, when did you first start putting things out?</strong></p>
<p>I had projects before ID Labs. I had like three or four projects in my neighborhood circling that. I put my own money into it, got my own CDs pressed up, was riding around with boxes in different neighborhoods, because I seen Ludacris say that's the way that he did it, So I was just like alright, let me take this pattern. I know everybody from different neighborhoods because I've been playing basketball everywhere, so I can just pull up and sell them, and that’s what I was doing at first, and then ID Labs came into place. I think it was like 2008, 2009, and that's where I met Wiz. My homey Freeze introduced us and we liked what each other was doing, and in the same day we made this record called “Me.” We made a record and we became friends and that's how it began.</p>
<p><strong>What happened with basketball?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, I was like super dope in football too, so after high school, basketball, even though I was playing in summer leagues, I put it on the back burner and was really focused on football. I went to Robert Morris and it was for a year and it was on Prop 48, so I couldn't practice, so I got kind of discouraged on what I was there for, like my purpose. It was 40 minutes from the city, so I could go home and get whatever I need and come back and sell it. You know what I'm saying. So I was going back and getting weed and going back to the dorm and selling it and then people started knocking on my door for it, and then the RA found out and he starts snitching and, there you go, I'm out of here.</p>
<p><strong>So, that was kind of it for sporting life?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that was it, but the people that I play with in the summer leagues are the same people from high school, so my s--t was always respected anyway. Even though I didn't go to college for basketball, the level of play was still on collegiate level, so I was still playing with my homies, I was still taking part in that, I just wasn't on the school tip because at the time I wouldn't be able to balance, like, being in school and doing what I was doing, because I had jumped straight into the street life. So I just started hustling and playing basketball when I could.</p>
<p><strong>How tall <em>are</em> you?</strong></p>
<p>Six-four.</p>
<p><strong>You and Wiz the same?</strong></p>
<p>I’m not gonna lie. He's almost like an inch taller than me. He be like, “Nah man, you’re taller.” I’m like, “Nah, bro, you’re taller.”</p>
<p><strong>Well, you’re both like giants. So, you also reference Nip and Mac on there. Talk about the work you did with them.</strong></p>
<p>I did one record with Nipsey and I did three records with Mac. The record with Nipsey was called “Neighborhood.” With me and him, we just talked a lot. We talked about life and stuff like that. The night that we recorded the record, I mean, it was an eight-hour session. We probably talked for three or four hours before we even got to do a song. So, that was cool. And me and Mac’s friendship is from day one, from him asking me to be on the record and him knowing me from going to school with my little cousins and stuff like that. And he's like, “Yo, Kev Tha Hustla’s your cousin?” So, he started popping up at ID Labs and we started working and we wanted to see each other win from Pittsburgh. And I knew he could rap his ass off but I didn't know that he was gonna take it to where he took it to. You know what I mean? So, I was just just on the sidelines cheering him on, and when he asked me to do something or he needed me or I needed him, it was always mutual.</p>
<p><strong>So, that must have been a rough year, 2018.</strong></p>
<p>Man, getting those phone calls. When you say their names, I immediately think about when I got the phone call. When anybody says those names, I think about where I was at, the situation, what I was thinking. It all just drives me back into that world, so the “Flowers” record [on “Since Birth”], I really wanted to get that out because it’s a whirlwind in my mind, like how do I speak on those two? Then I figured it out finally, and it was like, you know, when you pass away everybody brings flowers and it's like, why don’t you just give people the flowers now?</p>
<p><strong>What is it like to just have finally have this thing out there, such a long time coming?</strong></p>
<p>Man, it's the best feeling ever. Honestly. People always ask me and my emotions are all over the place just because I'm excited about it coming out, and we did all the work and I’m thankful for the squad. There's also people missing, you know, either dead or in jail or something like that. Through this whole situation, there were relationships with friends of mine that went sour, that I'm not cool with no more, that I didn't care to fix and things like that. I just kept moving because I was going somewhere and nobody really wanted to team up and be like, “Yeah, I'm gonna do this for you, so that we get to this place.” It was the same way I did with Wiz. I put everything I had to the side and said, “Yo, I’m gonna be the hypeman” because on stage we need to do this and da-da-da-da. So, we putting this album out right now, and the homies and everybody behind it and we’ve all been together, living this album.</p>
