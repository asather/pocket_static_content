<p>Ross Township commissioners Monday approved a three-year contract with its police union.</p>
<p>Commissioners also introduced an ordinance establishing an athletic advisory board, which may be the first in the area, and appointed several residents to township boards.</p>
<p>The police contract includes a 3% raise, and includes minor language changes requested by both sides “to make things run smoother,” said commission President Steve Korbel.</p>
<p>The union already ratified the deal. There are 41 officers in the union.</p>
<p>The contract was approved 8-0 with member Patrick Mullin absent.</p>
<p>An athletic advisory board would consist of nine people, including two representatives each from the West View/​Ross and North Hills athletic associations and North Hills Soccer.</p>
<p>There will also be three at-large positions and a liaison from the commissioners.</p>
<p>The board would make recommendations on maintaining the township’s fields, said Commissioner Joe Laslavic.</p>
<p>Mr. Laslavic said he believes that the board would be the first of its kind in the northern suburbs.</p>
<p>“We have to do something. We’re aware of that. And we think this is a good first step,” he said.</p>
<p>Commissioners reappointed Tara Howey to the zoning hearing board and Jennifer Deemer to the planning commission.</p>
<p>They also appointed seven residents to the newly established environmental advisory council: Kim Stelmach, Susan Hockenberry, Bradley August, Barry Rush, Caitlin Klotz, Kristen Schawalder and Ms. Deemer.</p>
<p>Terms will be staggered from one to five years.</p>
<p>A motion to appoint Sandra Miller to the equal opportunity board failed 2-6 with Jeremy Shaffer and Jack Betkowski voting in the affirmative. Ms. Miller ran unsuccessfully for commissioner in November.</p>
