<h1>PPS employee tests positive for COVID-19, forces closure of Mifflin PreK-8</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools has shut down its Mifflin PreK-8 school in Lincoln Place&nbsp;after a staff member tested positive for COVID-19, the district said Monday.</p>
<p>The school will be closed until Wednesday to&nbsp;allow the district’s facilities team to deep clean the building, officials said.</p>
<p>Students are taking online classes during the first nine weeks of the school year.</p>
<p>Because of the closure, however, grab-and-go meal service will be suspended at the building until Wednesday. Students and families can instead go to Greenfield PreK-8 or Carrick High School, where meals will be available from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district also announced Monday that the school board will add three instruction days to the school calendar to ensure the city schools meet the state’s 180 days requirement after the start of the academic year was delayed by a week.</p>
<p>The district <a href="https://www.pghschools.org/calendarvote?fbclid=IwAR2BlaatZSNAniwuciUCKt0WBQwjNm2656HA-O67twwYsv97U73rGRR62Hk" target="_blank">created a survey</a> allowing families to vote on which three student-only vacation days will become independent, asynchronous learning days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The board will vote on the additional days at its Sept. 23 legislative meeting.&nbsp;</p>
