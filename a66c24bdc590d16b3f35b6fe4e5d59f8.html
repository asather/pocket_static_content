<h1>Steelers mailbag: When to start worrying about the 2021 salary cap?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Brian Batko’s offseason-occasional Steelers mailbag. You’re more than welcome to email him at bbatko@post-gazette.com, tweet him @BrianBatko or slide into his DMs to inquire about the Steelers, NFL or anything out of bounds. </em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started, and don’t forget to join us on our weekly all-sports podcast, <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="_blank">The North Shore Drive</a>, whether you use Apple, Spotify or any of the other major podcasting platforms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rich from Indio CA:</strong> If the 2021 salary cap is based on 2020 revenue there is going to be a huge problem for teams at or near the current cap (hockey and NBA, too). Have you heard an discussion about that or is that a problem for down the road</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> It’s a problem for down the road that is inextricably linked to the most immediate problem, which is of course when, how <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/05/13/Florida-governor-sports-pro-teams-play-coronavirus/stories/202005130148" target="_blank">and possibly where</a> to start the 2020 NFL season. If you’re looking for much clarity in any matters regarding game scheduling, Hall of Fame induction ceremonies or, to your question, revenue streams, you won't find much <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2020/05/04/pro-football-hall-fame-game-ceremony-coronavirus-postpone/3082316001/" target="_blank">other than “contingency plans”</a> and the <a href="https://apnews.com/3f092f628ee726aabec51fbad6347f5f" target="_blank">NFL’s memo to teams</a> that it’s extending the virtual offseason through the end of May. If it continues through June, that’s virtually the whole offseason.</p>
<p>But yes, it would be prudent for teams to operate as if the usual salary cap increase is not in the cards for the 2021 season. Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/how-nfl-teams-and-players-are-preparing-for-a-major-salary-cap-hit-because-of-covid-19/" target="_blank">had a thorough piece Wednesday</a> about the ramifications of a potentially canceled or at least truncated 2020 campaign, and specifically mentions a prominent Steelers player therein.</p>
<p>“First, you'd see a greater willingness for teams to extend the franchise tag to top players set to become unrestricted free agents, sources on both the player and team sides told me,” Jones writes. “The formula for the non-exclusive tag is tied to a percentage of the cap, and should the cap decrease, so would the tag number. A player like JuJu Smith-Schuster would get the short end of the stick here.”</p>
<p>Interesting. The story goes on to reference how teams with high-priced veterans — does that sound familiar? — could be affected even more by a much lower cap. Of course, the Steelers already get busy every offseason restructuring contracts and converting base salary to signing bonuses, so they're one franchise already well-versed in what could become an even more necessary process.</p>
<p>So, those are the some of the particular hurdles that the Steelers might have to deal with in the event of a dwindling cap, but the advice here is to not worry about it all that much. Through TV money and rights deals, the NFL might find a way to keep its numbers up regardless. If not, plenty of teams — successful teams, mind you — would be in the same predicament as the Steelers. The Rams, Falcons, Patriots, Buccaneers, Chiefs and Cowboys have less cap space at this exact moment than the Steelers, <a href="https://overthecap.com/salary-cap-space/" target="_blank">according to overthecap.com</a>, and you’d likely rather be sharing a plight with that half-dozen as opposed to the likes of Cleveland, Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Cincinnati — at least in the short term.</p>
<p><strong>Paul from Sacramento:</strong> Hi Brian, I really like your chats and insight.. Do you see any QB's in next years draft that would be considered by the Steelers in a possible late 1st round?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Thank you, Paul, both for the compliment and keeping the sunny California vibe alive in this mailbag. Surely, there will be quarterbacks the Steelers take a shine to in the 2021 draft, but when it comes to evaluating that, we don't even know what we don't know. As is the case with the team’s fortunes on the field in 2020, so much of its future, too, rests on what we see from Ben Roethlisberger coming off his elbow injury. His success, or lack thereof, will give us a better gauge of whether the Steelers need to address his position one year from now or two.</p>
<p>If for whatever reason — perhaps if Roethlisberger comes out and says he’s retiring after his current deal, or if he and/or Mason Rudolph struggle — the Steelers go into next offseason feeling like they need to find their next franchise passer, it’s still too early to tell who might be in their wheelhouse. Outside of Clemson wunderkind Trevor Lawrence and (probably) Ohio State’s Justin Fields, you won't find much of a consensus from draft gurus about the best quarterback prospects for this season, assuming there is a college football season, which would be another curveball entirely.</p>
<p><strong>J.P. G.:</strong> Brian, why is the national media such a Big Ben hater? He has given them no ammo over the last several years. Thanks</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> It’s as simple as this, J.P. — like many quarterbacks around the league, especially the starters, Roethlisberger is one of the more recognizable names in the sport. He’s been around as long as any of them not named Brady or Brees at this point, which contributes not only to being well-known but also becoming someone everyone has formed an opinion about by now. And most of the “national media,” of which you speak, have a platform that rewards strong thoughts, big opinions, hot takes.</p>
<p>So, “ammo” is a subjective term. When your livelihood depends on bloviating about sports topics, an aging quarterback remarking that he’ll simply “point to the playbook” as his way of helping a third-round pick at his position becomes an arrow in the quiver. If you attempt to say nothing, saying anything about Antonio Brown — especially combined with what he’s saying about you — becomes fodder for talking heads. Even something you can't control, such as a season-ending elbow injury, can have pundits calling for you to retire. That’s just the nature of being an NFL player and, in Roethlisberger’s case, a future Hall of Fame quarterback. If you can't bear to see or hear people “hating” on him in 2020, just steer clear of the TV, radio and Internet.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
