<p>The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank is handing out more food to Pittsburghers in need with another drive-thru distribution at its warehouse site in Duquesne on Monday.</p>
<p>The distribution will take place from noon to 3 p.m. at the intersection of South Duquesne Boulevard and South Linden Street. The food bank is asking people not to arrive before 11 a.m.</p>
<p>The nonprofit said it plans to serve up to 1,000 vehicles at this distribution, and that each vehicle will receive two boxes of food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are asked to stay in their vehicles and to unlock their trunk or backseat door so volunteers can place the food into their car.</p>
<p>Those needing more food help should contact their local food pantry or contact the food bank for help in locating a pantry near where you live, according to the nonprofit.</p>
