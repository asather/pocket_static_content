<h1>Cranberry company donates 65,000 respirators to Highmark for use throughout the region</h1>

<p>Allegheny Health Network and its parent company, Highmark Health, said a partnership with Cranberry-based MSA Safety has netted the health care provider — and Pittsburgh —&nbsp;with 65,000 donated N-95 respirators.</p>
<p>The announcement made Sunday in a news release said the shipment of these face masks will support “the greater Pittsburgh region’s response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.”</p>
<p>Donald Whiting, AHN’s chief medical officer, will help coordinate with the chief medical officers at other local hospitals to “develop a distribution strategy for the masks.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the AHN team will work with Allegheny County to help support the needs of first responders, EMS and other health care providers.</p>
<p>The masks will involve a collaboration with several hospitals in the region, including “St. Clair, Washington, Butler [Health System], Excela Health, Heritage Valley and UPMC,” said Dr. Whiting. “As this evolves, it’s going to take an entire regional effort from all hospitals and all their capacity to work as a unit and as a team.”</p>
<p>He said he has heard rumors of shipments of masks being hijacked and sold on the black market. As a precaution, he&nbsp; said, the process was covert.</p>
<p>“It was fairly confidential until they arrived, as they were coming across the country and from out of the county,” he said. “Once they got here [on Saturday], we had a conference call with the other [hospitals] to reach out to them.”</p>
<p>Mark Deasy, an MSA spokesman, said the masks originated in Mexico. Originally, the masks were allotted for MSA customers who use them for industrial applications. MSA sources the masks from a manufacturer in China, he said.</p>
<p>“Prior to all this happening, we did have stock of those [N-95 masks] in different parts of the world,” Mr. Deasy said. “So we started putting some aside — for employees or other industrial customers. We had stock in Mexico. Then, when [the pandemic] started to accelerate and we saw where it was going, we knew we had to do something to help stop [the spread], and we were able to make them available in Pittsburgh.”</p>

<p>MSA doesn’t make or sell equipment to the medical or health care industries, Mr. Deasy said. So when David Holmberg, the president and chief executive officer of Highmark Health, reached out to MSA’s president and CEO, Nish J. Vartanian,&nbsp;“it was real out-of-the-box thinking,” Dr. Whiting said.</p>
<p>“David called us and said,&nbsp;‘Hey, you’re in the safety business …, ’” Mr. Deasy said.</p>
<p>As to why the company donated the masks, worth about $50,000?</p>
<p>“Well, we’re a 105-year-old company based in Pittsburgh,” Mr. Deasy said.&nbsp;“During that time, our mission has never changed. Our mission is protecting people at work, so they can do their jobs safely. This is what we do. So it was a no-brainer. That’s our DNA.”</p>
<p>With the masks in hand, Dr. Whiting said collaboration will be instrumental in getting them to the right people.</p>
<p>“There needs to be a collaboration between hospitals. A collaboration about beds, ICU beds and critical equipment,” he said. “The traditional thinking in Pittsburgh is that it’s a competition between one institution vs. another. There’s literally no room for that now. This situation won’t allow for competition or posturing.</p>
<p>“This truly is a regional response to a worldwide pandemic.”</p>
