<h1>NCAA's eligibility decision leaves Pitt spring athletes with unexpected choice</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last fall, Pitt’s life skills program held a seminar aimed at preparing athletes for an inevitability for anyone who ever picks up a ball, bat or pair of sneakers — the end of your career.</p>
<p>When the games end, there’s a life looming beyond those fields and courts that looks drastically different than everything they had known to that point. With that comes an adjustment, one with which some athletes struggle for years.</p>
<p>As Kaitlyn Kruger, a softball player in her senior year at Pitt, walked out of the room, she turned to Penny Semaia, the school’s career and life skills coordinator and a former Pitt football player.</p>
<p>“There’s no way I’m going to be OK when softball is over,” Kruger recalled saying.</p>
<p>Semaia reassured her, drawing from his own experience, but the sentiment remained. Kruger loves softball, even more than she should, an admission that elicits a self-conscious laugh as she says it. Imagining a life without a sport she had played for nearly two decades was, well, unimaginable.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, Kruger, her fellow senior spring-sport athletes at Pitt and thousands of others like them across the country have been faced with perhaps an even more difficult mental exercise — a choice.</p>
<p>On March 30, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of all remaining events on the college sports calendar for the 2019-20 academic year, the NCAA announced it was giving spring-sport athletes an additional season of eligibility. Seniors could either extend their careers that had been temporarily ended or they could, for an array of possible reasons, opt to move on and enter a world away from college that awaited them.</p>
<p>It wasn’t solely the uncontrollable force of time that would determine when their career was over; it would be themselves.</p>
<p>Over the past month, it’s a consequential decision Kruger and 25 other seniors at Pitt have mulled.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to feel like that, that I had to stop this work because I couldn’t control it anymore and it was out of my hands,” said Dante Watson, a senior on Pitt’s track and field team who had chosen to return for another season. “It was just very weird. I was anxious, having to wait around and not knowing what the next steps are because it’s a unique situation. We’ve never had this happen before. There was just a lot of uncertainty.”</p>
<p>The existence of such a decision came after a period of doubt.</p>
<p>From the time that the ACC canceled the remainder of spring sports competitions to the NCAA’s ruling, 13 days elapsed, a stretch in which impacted athletes had no way of knowing what came next. They spoke often with coaches, who could offer some sense of comfort, but even they weren’t certain of what the NCAA might do. There was a fear, as was the case for Pitt pitcher Chris Gomez, of putting too much of a focus on one outcome. If he devoted most of his energy to finding a job, he may be unprepared for the resumption of his academic career. If that same time were spent getting ready for a second senior year that may never come, he risked entering the job market at an inherent disadvantage.</p>
<p>Once the NCAA’s permission was granted, there came a logistically complex, emotionally wrought dilemma that goes beyond a simple pro/con list, helpful as those may be. As much as some athletes may have wanted to return, the financial toll of another year of schooling had to be considered as the vast majority of players are only on partial scholarships. They didn’t want to feel as though they were abandoning their teammates, friends and coaches if they chose not to return.</p>
<p>“I want them to be happy,” Pitt baseball coach Mike Bell said. “I don’t ever want to make a decision for a young man. I try to provide the facts and not try to skew them one way or another. I try to provide them the information and ultimately let him and his family make that decision. But I want them to know they always have a home.”</p>
<p>Even with the NCAA’s blessing, there was some question about whether the home they had come to know was still there for them. Schools weren’t required to grant financial aid at the rate they previously had. An athletic department as large and profitable as Wisconsin prohibited seniors from pursuing the extra year they were granted. The Ivy League, which has long not allowed athletes to compete as graduates, reached a similar conclusion.</p>
<p>Pitt and athletic director Heather Lyke, a former spring-sport athlete herself, gave the Panthers’ affected athletes the green light some of them so desperately desired.</p>
<p>“I have empathy for the kids in this entire situation, young and old,” Lyke said. “Student-athletes, they’re missing out on things we just can’t recapture.”</p>
<p>Some athletes are trying to reclaim whatever it is they lost over the past two months.</p>
<p>Of the 26 seniors between the Panthers’ baseball, softball, and track and field rosters, at least nine have opted to return, with others still considering it as a possibility. Among those who will take advantage of the NCAA’s allowance, there is a common sentiment. The ending they had envisioned for their career had been stripped from them. People accustomed to control were deprived of any sense of it. The abrupt cancellation of the season left many without a sense of closure, which they hope another year and another season could provide.</p>
<p>They wanted, more than anything else, to end their respective careers on their own terms.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go the rest of my life thinking of my best times and how unique the college experience was and I cut it short when I had the opportunity to come back for one more year,” Gomez said. “I didn’t want to live with regret.”</p>
<p>That pull was so strong that, for some, their decision was made virtually the second the NCAA’s was publicized.</p>
<p>“I didn’t even think twice about it,” said Aysha Muhammad, a senior hurdler on the track and field team.</p>
<p>The path back for others wasn’t so straightforward.</p>
<p>In the case of some athletes, there was a life beyond campus waiting for them, namely in the form of a job. On the day of the Panthers’ ACC opener, Kruger had to miss her team’s game to fly to Chicago for a final round of interviews for a position as a health-care consultant with Guidehouse, an opportunity Kruger described as her dream job. A few days later, about a week before the season was canceled, she received the call she had been eagerly awaiting — she got the gig.</p>
<p>With little idea about what would unfold in the weeks to come, Kruger accepted the offer. A metaphorical door had opened for her with an additional season of eligibility, but her decision had been made. She was the team’s top hitter in an abbreviated season, but her competitive softball career was over.</p>
<p>“My career path is something I’ve worked for for years,” Kruger said. “Yes, I love softball and I’ve enjoyed it these past 17 years that I’ve played it, but there’s a time for everything. Softball is coming to a close for me. Because this lined up perfectly, it seemed so clear to me that it was for a reason.”</p>
<p>Beyond post-college professional opportunities that solved their dilemma, some seniors, like Genaya Johnson, have chosen not to return due to a feeling of physical and mental exhaustion.</p>
<p>A senior sprinter, Johnson spent much of the past four years engaging in an endless balancing act. There were academic commitments. There was everything that came with track, from meets to practices to weight-lifting to service hours to treatment sessions. It was, as she put it, “a full-time job where you work overtime and don’t get paid for working overtime.” Johnson loved track and had been running in some form since she was six, but at a certain point, it became onerous.</p>
<p>“It was just such a draining time,” Johnson said. “It was fun, I appreciated it and I benefited so much from it, but it was just so much of a responsibility — how you represent yourself, what you’re doing constantly. It’s like your world revolves around athletics, which is kind of hard. I feel like I gave it all I could and I gave it all I had. I think it was just time for me to go. I love the sport and I love watching the sport, but I don’t think doing the sport is for me anymore.”</p>
<p>The five seniors on Pitt’s baseball team have faced a different kind of predicament. While Gomez has opted to return, teammates David Yanni and Nico Popa are waiting to see the results of June’s MLB draft, which was shortened from its usual 40 rounds to five, before making a final decision.</p>
<p>For as much as players have been told not to strain themselves or over-analyze their situations, it’s difficult to resist doing just that.</p>
<p>“It’s scary, man,” Yanni said. “This is something I never would have expected. Hopefully, that wasn’t the last game I ever played, but it may be a reality.”</p>
<p>For many who will be returning to Pitt, their second chance at a senior season will come with a renewed sense of appreciation.</p>
<p>Some will get the chance to pursue master’s degrees with some financial assistance. Of course, there are also the sports and spots on a roster that, for an agonizing two weeks, they feared would no longer be there, making it something akin to a college sports version of “It’s a Wonderful Life.”</p>
<p>“Honestly, from my point of view, as soon as things open up, I’m going back to Pittsburgh to start practicing and working out with the guys and working to come back,” Gomez said. “I miss the team. Being a senior and seeing my career was done, it makes you realize what you lost. Now coming back, this will be a whole different experience.”</p>
<p>There’s a different reality for those not coming back. Even for those like Johnson who are ending their college careers on their own volition, the decision didn’t come easily. For much of their lives, these sports had dictated their calendars, forged friendships and even shaped identities. Now, they’ll never be a part of their lives in the same way.</p>
<p>Compounding that pain is the abruptness of the conclusion. There won’t be a senior day, at least not a traditional one. There won’t be that final meet or game that they enter realizing that this may very well be it.</p>
<p>Following what would be Pitt’s last softball game of the 2020 season, an 11-2 loss at Charlotte on March 11, the team rode on a bus for 10 hours back home. Shortly after returning to Pittsburgh, and with all remaining classes that semester being conducted remotely, Kruger packed up her apartment and flew home to California, leaving behind everything she had come to know over the past four years in what felt like a blur. The end she had dreaded for so long had arrived.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to just let it go,” Kruger said. “You’ll never have that last at-bat, that last out, that last time playing on Vartabedian Field. I’ll never have that. That’s really hard.”</p>
