<h1>Beginning Monday, Turnpike will stop using toll collectors, but the trip won't be free</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Turnpike temporarily will quit using toll collectors and won’t accept cash payments at 8 p.m. Monday to help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>As a result, any customer who usually pays by cash will become a Toll-By-Plate customer, which means the turnpike will take a photo of their license plate when they pass through a toll booth and send them a bill by mail within 30 days. They can pay online, by phone or by mail.</p>
<p>There will be no change for customers who use the prepaid E-ZPass transponder.</p>
<p>The move is designed to reduce direct interaction between motorists and toll collectors. About 600 toll collectors will not report to work but will continue to be paid, spokesman Carl DeFebo said.</p>
<p>“This temporary measure is critical to enable us to support the Commonwealth in its efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” turnpike CEO Mark Compton said in a news release. “I want to be clear that we will return to normal toll-collection operations as soon as it becomes practical.”</p>

<p>Motorists who don’t have an E-ZPass account should continue to pass through toll booths marked “tickets” at entry and “cash,” at exit, where license plate photos will be taken, but they should keep moving rather than stopping. The turnpike urged motorists to be extra cautious because there may be some confusion as this change begins.</p>
<p>Tolls will be calculated at the higher cash rate, but when motorists pay the bill they have the option of creating an E-ZPass account that would instantly charge them the discounted E-ZPass rate.</p>
<p>If motorists don’t pay the first invoice within 20 days, they receive a second bill with an additional fee of $5 or 1.5% of the amount owed, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Tolls still can be paid by cash on the Mon-Fayette Expressway, which uses automated payment machines.</p>
<p>The turnpike is in the process of changing to an all-electronic payment system in the fall of 2021.</p>
<p>The turnpike also took steps last week to limit services at the King of Prussia and Valley Forge service plazas to reduce contact between motorists and employees. All restaurants and bathrooms inside the plazas are closed and portable toilets are available outside.</p>
