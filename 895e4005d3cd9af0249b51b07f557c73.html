<h1>The decision to self-isolate is tough on contractors — as is not having the option</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Erik Hoolihan likes to hold up a cell phone and remind his kids how many thousands of people had to work to make it possible. His point — that every part of the supply chain is essential.</p>
<p>But on Monday, Mr. Hoolihan, who is president of Tech Insulation in West Deer, was struggling to keep up with how the definition of essential work is shifting in the face of COVID-19.</p>

<p>As a union contractor, he knows that if his employees don’t work, they don’t get paid. And if they don’t work for long enough, they may lose health and pension benefits, which typically depend on reaching a certain number of working hours.</p>
<p>“That’s quite a scary situation for a lot of the guys, if this extends multiple months and we have a workforce that cannot meet the hours to get their healthcare.”</p>
<p>The government is giving orders for two-week windows, he said — Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday ordered all non-essential businesses to shut down for 14 days — but Mr. Hoolihan can’t manage his projects in two-week spurts, especially if he doesn’t know when it will end.</p>
<p>At this point, no one knows that. As the new coronavirus crisis was unfolding in recent weeks, Tech Insulation, like many other employers, was leaving the decision of not working to prevent the spread of infection up to the workers.</p>
<p>Everyone has to do what they feel is in their families’ best interests, Mr. Hoolihan reasoned.</p>
<p>The difficult decision of whether to follow the advice of public health experts — and Mr. Trump, who advised that people should not gather in groups of more than 10 — or risk life without a paycheck for some indefinite amount of time, falls on individuals.</p>
<p>Some in the construction industry are wishing they still had that choice.</p>
<p>UPMC notified its contractors on Monday that it is suspending all&nbsp;non-critical construction work. PennDOT halted all of its current projects as did the Pennsylvania Turnpike.</p>
<p>The two transportation agencies comprise nearly all the work of Plum Contracting in Salem Township, which laid off all of its field staff and some shop workers — more than 100 people total — on Monday night.</p>
<p>Jack Mills, president of the company, said that in most instances, his workers would have been able to observe the 6-foot distance recommended to prevent virus particles from being exchanged, but what puzzles him most is that construction work was specifically listed as an essential service in Mr. Wolf’s directive.</p>
<p>The Associated General Contractors of America, a Virginia-based industry group, issued a statement on Tuesday saying that&nbsp;“halting construction activity will do more harm than good for construction workers, community residents and the economy.”</p>
<p>It urged project owners to reconsider such moves and, if they must delay construction, the association asked that they pay their contractors as scheduled and consider it a down payment for work that will be finished later.&nbsp;</p>
