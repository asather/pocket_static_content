<p>California University of Pennsylvania President Geraldine Jones&nbsp; informed students and employees Monday that she will retire in January after a 46-year career at her alma mater where she became a dean, provost and ultimately the chief executive.</p>
<p>Ms. Jones, 69, a first-generation college student, cited the approach of her 70th birthday as the reason she announced plans now to step down after the fall semester from the presidency she has held for eight years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say good-bye when our University, and our world, are facing such acute challenges. But I have always planned to depart on my own schedule,” she wrote in a message to the campus. “This winter, when I mark a milestone birthday, is the right time for me to begin a new chapter in my life.”</p>
<p>Cal U and 13 other state-owned universities belonging to the State System of Higher Education are undergoing a redesign process complicated by a pandemic that has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/04/28/Will-Pa-state-owned-universities-have-a-regular-fall-inspite-of-COVID-19/stories/202004280068" target="_blank">added to enrollment and financial pressures.</a></p>
<p>Ms. Jones’ departure on Jan. 29 will trigger a search for her successor. The chair of Cal U’s Council of Trustees will form a panel of employees, students, trustees and alumni that will forward recommendations to the State System in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>Ms. Jones received a&nbsp;bachelor’s degree in education from California State College in 1972 and her master’s degree, also in education, in 1980. She taught briefly in the Albert Gallatin Area School District in Uniontown, then returned to Cal U in 1974 as a faculty member and administrator.</p>
<p>She directed the Upward Bound college access program for 20 years and served 11 years as chair of the Department of Academic Development Services. Next, she became associate dean of the College of Education and Human Services for two years and later the dean from 2000-2008.</p>
<p>Four of her years as president were in acting and interim roles before being named permanently in April 2016.</p>
<p>During her tenure, Cal U introduced academic programs supporting <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2017/02/11/Facing-State-System-review-Cal-U-to-emphasize-science-and-technology/stories/201702100215" target="_blank">its special mission in science and technology,</a> including drone technology, molecular biology and veterinary technology.&nbsp;The university also assumed operation of the former Washington Health System School of Radiologic Technology, based at Washington Hospital in Washington, Pa.</p>
<p>Ms. Jones said she was honored to work with the campus community and watch students develop.</p>
<p>“Over more than four decades I have come to know this University’s resilience, and I have seen firsthand the countless ways that Cal U changes lives, including my own.”</p>
