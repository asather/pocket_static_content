<h1>District's 2020-21 school calendar spelled out </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Peters Township School Board approved the district’s 2020-21 school calendar at its meeting Tuesday but not without resistance from some board members.</p>
<p>Prior to the board approving the school calendar by a vote of 7-2, board member Minna Allison suggested the board consider an alternate calendar that would have included a full week of spring break.</p>
<p>“We would have a solid spring break week in March,” Ms. Allison said, adding that the full week off would be “valuable to students,” particularly high school students who may want to visit the college to which they were accepted during that week or parents who take their kids on vacations.</p>
<p>Ms. Allison’s suggestion of having March 29-April 2 as the designated spring break — that would have included five weekdays and four weekend days — was met with pushback from the board and district administrators. </p>
<p>Deputy Superintendent Jennifer Murphy said adding an entire week off would impact the middle school more than any other school because it runs on a different course schedule.</p>
<p>“It impacts the content they cover,” Ms. Murphy said, adding that a weeklong spring break would make the third quarter at the middle school shorter and the fourth quarter longer by a few days, which could impact the way courses are taught.</p>
<p>Board member Lisa Anderson said the weeklong break may not help students wanting to visit colleges because they may not get their acceptance letters until after the first week of April.</p>
<p>Board member Rolf Briegel added he could not see adding the week of spring break just for the high schoolers who may visit colleges if it would potentially disrupt learning at the middle school.</p>
<p>The board eventually approved a school calendar that provides for a spring break running March 31 through April 6. The calendar passed 7-2 with Ms. Anderson, Mr. Briegel, Rebecca Bowman, Ronald Dunleavy, Jamison Hardy, Thomas McMurray and Daniel Taylor voting in favor and Ms. Allison and Jennifer Grossman dissenting.</p>
<p>In addition to the spring break, the calendar calls for the first day of school to be on Aug. 19, a winter break that runs from Dec. 17 through Jan. 6, 2021, and graduation set for June 11, 2021.</p>
