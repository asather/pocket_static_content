<h1>Menuette to pop-up permanently in Brookline</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Menuette, a popular pop-up restaurant and caterer, will move into a permanent location at 600 Brookline Blvd. later this year, per an announcement on the business’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>The concept, founded by Rebecca Nicholson and chef chef Christian Schulz, was already a regular in the neighborhood, where they served their upscale fare at the 802 Bean Company coffee shop. Hitchhiker Brewing and the Korner Pub in Mt. Lebanon have also been frequent staging areas.</p>
<p>The name Menuette is a play on “minuet” and&nbsp;“is based on Mr. Schulz’s past as a musician and a student of music,” the Post-Gazette reported in 2018.</p>
<p>Ms. Nicholson studied hospitality at Penn State University before working at hotels, restaurants and catering businesses in New York, California and back home in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The two Dormont residents met in 2015 while working at the former Block 292 in Mt. Lebanon and later at Senti in Lawrenceville. Previously, Mr. Schulz had also worked for the now-shuttered Crested Duck Charcuterie and Root 174.</p>
<p>Menuette will take the place of the former Parker’s sandwich shop. In late 2019, owner Luke Parker moved a few doors down to 542 Brookline Blvd. to open Red’s Good News, a neighborhood bar that began serving food last month.</p>
