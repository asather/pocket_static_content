<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation announced Tuesday it is reopening indoor facilities at 23 of its 30 rest stops with additional cleaning and maintenance, one week after it closed all indoor facilities to help curb the spread of COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>The reopened facilities will include the 13 areas that have had portable toilets and handwashing facilities since March 17. Trucking organizations and some elected officials had complained about closing the rest areas.</p>
<p>“While unnecessary travel is discouraged as we all do our part to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, we understand that some trips are necessary and that access to rest areas is important,” Acting PennDOT Secretary Yassmin Gramian said in a news release. “We are constantly evaluating our actions and services in responding to this emergency and will make adjustments where we can safely do so.”</p>
