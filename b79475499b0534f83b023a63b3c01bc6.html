<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Big Something/Andy Frasco &amp; The U.N.:</strong> The Royal Rumble Tour pairs the Phishy, electronic band from North Carolina with Frasco and his more swinging, good-time funky vibe. Rex Theater, South Side. 8 p.m. $22; eventbrite.com.</p>
<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lower Dens:</strong> The Baltimore synth-pop band, led by gender-fluid singer Jana Hunter, sets up at The Funhouse at Mr. Smalls, Millvale (down-scaled from the bigger theater), supporting their fourth album, “The Competition.” Drawing comparisons to Roxy Music and New Order, the band has an elegant, lush and melodic sound over which Hunter addresses subjects both personal and political. Ami Dang opens at 8 p.m. $18 advance, $20 day of show; ticketweb.com.</p>

<p><strong>Soulive:</strong> The jazz/funk trio from Woodstock, N.Y., which built its following opening for the likes of The Rolling Stones, The Roots and Dave Matthews Band, bring its intoxicating, organ-drenched jams to the Roxian, McKees Rocks. ​Mike Dillon Band, led by the percussionist, a vibraphonist from Texas, opens at 8 p.m. $23; roxianlive.com.</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Durand Jones &amp; The Indications:</strong> The old-school soul revival band has no shortage of appropriate material for a Valentine’s Day gig at Spirit Hall, Lawrenceville. The group, inspired by the sound of Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and the like, formed as students at Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music and recorded its first album for $450. The Indications return on the tour behind “American Love Call,” a more accomplished second album that captures sound and spirit of soul’s heyday. Variety wrote of the live show, “...I can attest that witnessing Jones live is very much akin to how I imagine the early shows of his heroes from the ‘60s and ‘70s – tight as hell, bursting with raw emotion and drenched in sweat.” 8 p.m. $16; ticketmaster.com.</p>

<p><strong>Queensryche:</strong> Guitarist Michael Wilton and bassist Eddie Jackson are the lone members from the 1980 lineup of this West Coast progressive metal band. Todd La Torre, who replaced Geoff Tate in 2012, said on the MetalSucks Podcast, “Some people go, 'Oh, they're only down to two [original] members right now.' Well, so what? We wish that Scott [Rockenfeld] would have come back earlier. But Alice in Chains has two [original] members. Accept has one member. Judas Priest has two members. Fates Warning has one member... There's a lot of bands still putting out really great music that are kicking ass.” Wilton says that Queensryche’s latest, 15th album “The Verdict,” “is the most metal and the most progressive record we have made in a long time.” They play the Roxian, McKees Rocks, with John 5 and Adam to Eve. 8 p.m. $30; roxianlive.com.</p>
<p><strong>Zoso — The Ultimate Led Zeppelin Experience:</strong> They don’t just play the hits and peace out. This “ultimate” tribute band goes deep into Zep’s torrid blues and psychedelic jams. They even look like them. It’s an Experience, for sure, and the price is nice. Stage AE, North Shore. With Kiss the Sky. 7 p.m. doors. $15 advance; $20 door; ticketmaster.com.</p>
<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joshua Redman:</strong> The saxophonist, who grew up in Berkeley, Calif., the son of jazz legend Dewey Redman, almost went to law school before he turned his focus to music. He then came to fame in the early ‘90s after winning the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition and worked with players like Pat Metheny, Charlie Haden, Christian McBride, Jack DeJohnette and Clark Terry. Redman debuted in 1993 and earned a Grammy nomination with his first album. Last year, he released “Come What May,” his first album with the Joshua Redman Quartet in almost two decades. He brings his band to the August Wilson Center, Downtown.&nbsp;8 p.m. $38.75; aacc-awc.org.</p>

<p><strong>The Cadillac Three:</strong> The Nashville Southern rock band, which had a former life as American Bang, is fronted by Jaren Johnston, who’s co-written hits for Keith Urban, Tim McGraw and Jake Owen. They debuted TC3 on Big Machine in 2012 and now come with a fourth called “Country Fuzz,” so named, Johnston told Billboard, because “We got sick of being called Southern rock or too rock for country. So, we gave everybody something to call us that we actually thought was cool and made sense.” They play Mr. Smalls at 8 p.m. with Boy Named Banjo. $24.50; ticketweb.com.</p>
<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinners:</strong> The Detroit group, dating all the way back to 1954, filled the airwaves with some of the most timeless R&amp;B hits of the ’70s including “I’ll Be Around,” “Could It Be I’m Falling in Love” and “Then Came You,” not to mention “One of a Kind (Love Affair),” “Games People Play” and “The Rubberband Man.” After lead singer Bobby Smith died in 2013, the group’s lone surviving member, Henry Fambrough, decided to keep it going. The 81-year-old leads a group of relative youngsters to the Palace Theatre in Greensburg. 3 p.m. $43-$75; thepalacetheatre.org.</p>
<p><strong>Saint Motel:</strong> The LA indie band, known for its sly, funky sound, high-energy and visually dazzling shows, arrives at the Roxian, McKees Rocks, having just released “Van Horn,” the first single from forthcoming project “The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack: Part 1.” With Kolars. 8 p.m. $25; roxianlive.com.</p>
