<h1>PennDOT resumes a few area road projects, expects a big push beginning May 1</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and contractors are gearing up to resume road construction projects with a flourish next week under Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan for restarting an economy that has been brought to a near standstill by the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>A handful of projects resumed last week and this week after contractors completed a series of safety meetings with PennDOT officials to make sure they’re familiar with a new, 31-page packet of safety protocols. As many as 100 more are expected to resume after May 1, Jason Zang, assistant district executive for construction for PennDOT’s District 11, which includes Allegheny, Beaver and Lawrence counties, said Monday.</p>
<p>“They’re not all going to happen on May 1,” Mr. Zang said.&nbsp;“The contractors are anxious to get started, but there are a lot of steps they have to take care of first. Once all of that happens, they can get started.”</p>

<p>In addition to new safety procedures&nbsp;— which include social distancing and taking temperatures before workers leave home and again when they arrive at work —&nbsp; some contractors have to assemble work crews and redeploy equipment removed from job sites after work was shut down March 16. In some instances, they also have to order supplies such as asphalt, gravel and other road materials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These projects generally follow the same critical, safety-related criteria of 18 projects that resumed two weeks ago, Mr. Zang said. The handful of additional projects approved to resume are:</p>
<p>• $3.54 million project to rehabilitate the Noblestown Road Bridge over Interstate 79 in Collier. (Resumed April 22.)</p>
<p>• $4.37 million to replace bridges, improve drainage and install turning lanes on Route 88 in Bethel Park and South Park Township. (Resumed Monday.)</p>
<p>• $3.79 million for a landslide repair on Route 136 in Elizabeth Township. (Resumed Monday.)</p>
<p>• $29.34 million for the Interstate 579 cap project to build a 3-acre park over the top of the highway to reconnect the Hill District with Downtown Pittsburgh. (Resumes Tuesday with overnight lane and shoulder restrictions 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. weeknights between the Bedford Avenue and Webster Avenue bridges starting in the northbound direction.)</p>
<p>• $14.6 million for improvements to Route 19/51 between the West End Circle and the Parkway West exit. (Finishing work resumes Wednesday.)</p>
<p>Mr. Zang said the Route 88 project highlights the issues PennDOT and contractors have faced since the March shutdown. Contractor&nbsp;C.H. &amp; D. Enterprises Inc. was called off the project during drainage work and had to be called back for emergency conditions several times created by heavy rain.</p>
<p>“If we’re sending the contractor out there every week anyway, why not have them work?” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The projects that started two weeks ago have gone relatively smoothly so far, Mr. Zang said. Contractors and workers alike seem to have gone out of their way to follow safety procedures, he said.</p>
<p>“All in all, I’m hearing everybody is taking [social distancing and other safety requirements] very seriously,” he said. “As long as that happens, we’re going to be in good shape.”</p>
<p>Those included repaving a 3.5-mile section of Route 22 from Route 48 in Monroeville to the Westmoreland County line and a series of landslide repairs that often involve heavy machine operators but few laborers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Zang said among the biggest challenges is bridge construction, where in the past groups of workers scurried to install bolts to secure beams when they are put in place.</p>
<p>“In those situations, we’re making sure everyone is wearing masks and keeping the number of workers to a minimum, two if we can,” he said. “I think everybody’s aware of the rules and stepping up as best as they can.”</p>
<p>Mr. Zang said the district hasn’t made any final decisions on how many other new projects it might tackle this season. The department continues to advertise for bids, but it wants to see how the continuing projects proceed before beginning more.</p>
<p>“Those are still being evaluated,” he said.</p>
