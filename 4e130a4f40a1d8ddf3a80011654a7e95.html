<h1>Despite record harvest, Pennsylvania has more bears than ever</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>White-tailed deer were regionally extinct in Pennsylvania in the early 1900s, but there are too many in some areas today. Three bald eagle nests were known in the state in 1980. Now some 300 nesting pairs are confirmed including four in once-polluted Allegheny County.</p>
<p>Both populations represent world-class conservation achievements accomplished in highly industrial, highly populated Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Here’s another: There are more black bears in Penn’s Woods than when European settlers arrived in the 1600s. Bear density was carefully grown from about 5,000 in 1980 to 20,000 today, pushing back against 40 years of massive habitat loss with modern wildlife management techniques. The primary tool used to accomplish this remarkable turnaround was regulated hunting.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2019, Pennsylvania hunters dropped 4,653 black bears, setting a new state record. The increase (3,153 bruins were taken in 2018) followed the largest suite of bear hunting opportunities ever approved in a single license year in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“There were 30 days of bear hunting across all bear seasons in 2019. The last time that happened was in 1931,” said Mark Ternent, a Game Commission biologist.</p>
<p>Now that the bear population is at what is believed to be the state’s maximum carrying capacity, Mr. Ternent is no longer the agency’s bear biologist and has taken a new position there.</p>
<p>Last year, hunters took 1,629 bears during the general firearm season; 1,340 in muzzleloader and special firearms seasons; 1,117 in the extended firearms season and 561 in archery bear season. Record harvests were set in the muzzleloader, extended and archery seasons.</p>
<p>“The muzzleloader harvest was higher than we expected,” said Travis Lau, Game Commission spokesman. “We saw a sizable number of adult females taken, around double the yearly average. In those two weeks [of muzzleloader bear season], a lot of pregnant females were probably still moving around and feeding.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lau said despite the unexpected harvest, the long-term average remained within an acceptable range.</p>
<p>“Wildlife is managed through long-term population trends, not one point on a chart,” he said. “Even though we’ve had a relatively stable bear population for five years, we’re coming off a couple years in a row where the bear harvest fell short of expectations because of rough weather.”</p>
<p><strong>Flies on film</strong></p>
<p>The annual Fly Fishing Film Tour, which benefits Casting for Recovery, will screen at The Oaks Theater in Oakmont on Sunday. Doors open at 2 p.m.; showtime is 3 p.m. Admission is $20, $15 in advance at International Angler in Robinson (412-788-8088).</p>
<p><strong>Ice fishing</strong></p>
<p>No ice. Hardcore hardtop anglers remained hopeful that the last weeks of February might blow in an arctic vortex. But generally it takes a week or more of steady cold to make the recommended 4 inches of safe ice.</p>
<p>The Western Pennsylvania Hardwater Tournament Series canceled its ice fishing tournaments at Lake Arthur and Lake Wilhelm. The Pymatuning Ice Fishing Tournament was scrapped, and events at Presque Isle Bay (Feb. 22) and Edinboro Lake (Feb. 23) remain on thin ice pending safety reviews.</p>
<p>At fishing shops, owners and managers are looking ahead to spring and wondering what to do with all that unsold ice fishing gear.</p>
<p>“Ice fishing is not a huge moneymaker, but it pays the bills in the winter when there’s not much going on,” said Glenda O’Donnell, co-owner of O'Donnell's Sports Supplies in Portersville, near Lake Arthur. “This year all that stuff didn’t sell. We thought about offering some ice fishing discounts to get it off the floor, but it wouldn’t be very fruitful because not many people are coming in. And we just got 80 boxes delivered for our spring order.”</p>
