<h1>Black bear spotted roaming through Cranberry yards and Graham Park </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As Cranberry Township residents celebrated Memorial Day, a large furry visitor decided to join in on the festivities and catch some sun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cranberry police responded to a call that a black bear was spotted in the backyard of a home on Robinhood Drive at about 1 p.m. Monday. Sgt.&nbsp;Chuck Mascellino said Tuesday that shortly after police arrived, the bear climbed a tree and proceeded to&nbsp;“laze about” for the next few hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s not really a protocol [to responding to bear sightings],” Mr. Mascellino said.&nbsp;“We go and try to see the bears ourselves and make sure it isn’t causing a disturbance. Yesterday, there were a lot of kids out and that neighborhood has a lot of homes with yards that are fenced in. So we wanted to let people know to keep the kids and animals inside.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few doors down, Heather Kreke and her children were playing in her backyard pool when an officer pulled up and alerted them that there was a bear up the street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Kreke said she walked down to see the bear and later posted photos of it to her Facebook page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It was there all day, at least eight or nine hours,” she said.&nbsp;“There were people all day driving past, stopping and looking.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms. Kreke, 38, who has lived in Cranberry the last 16 years, said that was the first time she had seen a bear in her neighborhood. The person who owned the house where the bear camped out was not home at the time, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Kreke said the sighting brought about some much needed quarantine excitement for her kids.&nbsp;“They weren’t scared. My 7-year-old was a little nervous that it was going to come swim in the pool, but other than that they were pretty excited. We took a bunch of walks down there during the course of the day to check it out and see what it was doing,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mascellino said officers advised on behalf of the Game Commission that residents keep a safe distance from the bear and leave it be, as it would eventually move on elsewhere.</p>
<p>Cranberry police got a call just after 10:30 a.m. Tuesday that the bear was spotted again near the entrance of&nbsp; Graham Park which is only about a mile away from Robinhood Drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If you see a bear, the best corse of action is to leave it alone,” Mr.&nbsp;Mascellino said.&nbsp;“Do not approach it. Keep pets and children inside and they’ll move on eventually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The only time the police department or Game Commission needs to be notified is if the bear is causing a disturbance or causing any damage like getting into trash.”&nbsp;</p>
