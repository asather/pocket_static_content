<h1>Ron Cook: Jimmy Morrissey is Pitt's perfect role model</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Give a lot of credit to Shivaun Morrissey for setting the right tone for her three kids in their Philadelphia home.</p>
<p>“She made it known that it wasn’t acceptable to get bad grades in our house. I didn’t challenge my mom,” said son Jimmy, grinning, perhaps at how ridiculous that admission sounds coming from a man who is now a hulking 6-feet-3, 305 pounds.</p>
<p>Jim Morrissey deserves an assist, as well, for encouraging his son that he could play major college football even after Jimmy had emailed every Power 5 head coach and not received a single response.</p>
<p>“I told him it wouldn’t be worth it,” Morrissey said of summer camp visits that his dad set up for him at Temple, Pitt and Boston College. “It was super discouraging not hearing back from anyone. Feeling that kind of rejection, I didn’t want to waste my time and get rejected even more. I guess my dad and my mom both believed in me a little more at the time than I did.”</p>
<p>Pitt owes a big thank you to Shivaun and Jim Morrissey.</p>
<p>I’m talking about chancellor Patrick Gallagher and the academicians. There is not a better representative of the university than Jimmy Morrissey. He graduated in 3½ years in December with a degree in finance and marketing and is taking classes toward his MBA at Pitt’s Katz Graduate School of Business. He is a three-time All-ACC Academic choice. He has served on Pitt’s prestigious Blue-Gold Society as an ambassador for the university and its alumni association.</p>
<p>I’m also talking about Pat Narduzzi and the football staff. With spring practice starting Monday, Morrissey is in line to be a four-year starting center and two-time captain. He was All-ACC first team last season and is being counted on by coaches and teammates to lead the program to its best season in decades in 2020.</p>
<p>No, Morrissey is not your typical student-athlete.</p>
<p>“It’s the only thing I’ve known,” he said of juggling school and football. “I really don’t think of it as a big chore. We do have full-time jobs as football players, but I love my full-time job. That makes it all worth it.</p>
<p>“My offensive line coach, coach [Dave] Borbely, when he got here after my redshirt freshman season, he said, ‘You have to take care of your business off the field to take care of your business on the field. Things that you do off the field reflect what you do on the field.’ That was a message that I took to heart. Love that guy.”</p>
<p>Morrissey’s academic achievements are not surprising. He considered Lehigh, Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Colgate, Bucknell and Dartmouth before deciding to walk on at Pitt in the fall of 2016.</p>
<p>Morrissey’s football success is another matter. To make his dad happy, he attended that summer camp at hometown Temple before his senior year of high school and played poorly. “I played against Philly competition,” Morrissey said. “I’ll let it be known that Philly ball is a lot better than Pittsburgh ball.”</p>
<p>Morrissey also came to Pitt’s summer camp and did a lot better. “I probably didn’t lose a one-on-one.” Pitt’s then-offensive line coach, John Peterson, liked Morrissey as a prospect. Then-offensive coordinator Jim Chaney did not.</p>
<p>“He said I was too short for him even though I had one of the best camp performances he’d seen from an offensive lineman,” Morrissey said. “He said that right to my face in the weight room. I remember it like yesterday. It was ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Morrissey had a chance to get a scholarship to Dartmouth, but, perhaps feeling his father’s push and knowing Chaney had moved on to Georgia, he asked Narduzzi if he would get a fair shot to play if he came to Pitt as a walk-on. Narduzzi told him yes and lived up to his word. Morrissey redshirted as a freshman in 2016 and became the starting center in 2017. He didn’t allow a sack last season and was Pitt’s best run blocker before going through the NFL draft evaluation process in January.</p>
<p>“They tell you first round, second round or go back to school,” Morrissey said. “They told me to go back to school. I knew, deep down, that I needed another year of development. I don’t think, personally, I played as well last season as I could have. My ankle still wasn’t totally healthy.”</p>
<p>That goes back to his injury late in a game at Wake Forest in 2018. Pitt was about to win the game and an ACC Coastal division championship when the play call “Sprint Right London” came in from the sideline. It was a trick play designed for quarterback Kenny Pickett to roll right and throw back across the field to left tackle Stefano Millin. Morrissey was blocking downfield when Millin dived for the end zone, Millin’s helmet crashing into the outside of Morrissey’s right ankle. Millin scored a touchdown and celebrated. Morrissey didn’t get up.</p>
<p>“The worst memory of my life. It was a pain I had never experienced before,” Morrissey said. “I remember Dan Marino and Jimbo Covert were there. They walked off the field. I crutched off behind them. My dreams were crushed.”</p>
<p>Pitt’s offense wasn’t the same without Morrissey. It scored just three points the next week in a loss at Miami. It was crushed by Clemson, 42-10, in the ACC championship. It lost to Stanford, 14-13, in the Sun Bowl.</p>
<p>“The only thing I really wanted that season was to play Clemson in the ACC championship game, especially because of the D-line that they had,” Morrissey said. “I thought it would be a good opportunity, if I had a good game, to put my name on the map.</p>
<p>“It was heart-breaking. Just recently, I changed my screen saver. It was the picture of the [42-10] scoreboard. Every time I looked at it … Things like that motivate me. I looked at it every day. It just became too much.”</p>
<p>Morrissey hopes to get one more shot at Clemson — his final shot — in the ACC championship after the 2020 season. He likes Pitt’s chances of getting there, likes that Pickett is back for his senior season, likes that offensive coordinator Mark Whipple is back for his second season and likes that all of the starting offensive linemen return.</p>
<p>“And our defense!” Morrissey gushed. “Our defensive line is just ridiculous. We might have the best D-line in the country. The majority of games are still won in the trenches.”</p>
<p>Morrissey will get his shot at the NFL next spring as long as he stays healthy. Narduzzi believes in him. Borbely believes in him. His teammates believe in him. Two people in Philadelphia definitely believe in him.</p>
<p>“Mom and Dad,” Morrissey said in a soft voice for such a giant of a man, the love and appreciation clearly coming across. “They’re the two greatest people I know. They’re never going to bail on me.”</p>
