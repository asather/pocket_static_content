<h1>Synagogue massacre case’s deadlines extended because of virus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The federal judge overseeing the case of Robert Bowers, accused of gunning down 11 worshipers at Tree of Life synagogue in 2018, has ordered that filing deadlines for new pretrial motions by the defense will be extended for 90 days.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowers' defense team, which said it intends to challenge the indictment and the government's notice of intent to seek the death penalty, had on Monday requested a suspension of all deadlines because of complications arising from the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>The government objected to a suspension, suggesting instead that the defense be given an extension of one or two weeks. In light of other issues still pending, including motions to suppress and legal procedures related to Mr. Bowers' mental health, the U.S. attorney's office agreed to the 90-day extension but noted that the virus crisis is not an adequate basis to "completely suspend orderly progress towards trial."</p>

<p>The defense team indicated it should be able to file its challenges to the indictment by early June.</p>
<p>In addition to the extension, U.S. District Judge Donetta Ambrose said other deadlines that had already been pending will be suspended until May 30.</p>
<p>The parties also addressed the contention by the defense lawyers, raised on Monday in their motion to suspend deadlines, that they have been unable to meet with Mr. Bowers in person at the Butler County Prison because of the virus.</p>
<p>Federal marshals indicated, however, that lawyers can still meet with Mr. Bowers at the jail as long as they take protective measures, according to the U.S. attorney's office.</p>
<p>For months, Mr. Bowers and his lawyers have repeatedly sparred with the prosecution over deadlines, delays and discovery issues.</p>
<p>Last week, however, the defense lost a significant legal battle. They had challenged the constitutionality of the federal death penalty on numerous grounds, saying it violated various amendments. Judge Ambrose rejected them all.</p>
