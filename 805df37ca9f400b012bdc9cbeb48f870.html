<h1>Is it Trump? Biden? Nope. It's Jo Jorgensen</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With a presidential election 94 days out, it’s no surprise that a bus was idling at Pittsburgh International Airport Saturday afternoon waiting to shuttle its candidate through a barrage of Western Pennsylvania appearances, including one in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>But the words splashed across the bright blue motor coach were neither that of incumbent Donald Trump, nor his chief rival, Democrat Joe Biden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, it was a less-than-household name: Jo Jorgensen, 63, a Clemson University professor and the Libertarian Party’s candidate. She and her vice-presidential running mate,&nbsp;Jeremy “Spike” Cohen, are stumping separately through eastern and western parts of Pennsylvania this weekend, seeking the required petition signatures by Aug. 3 to place them and other Libertarians on Pennsylvania’s election ballot.</p>
<p>The threshold is 5,000 signatures, but in reality, it means gathering 7,000 to 10,000 to withstand challenges, Sam Robb, the campaign’s Pennsylvania coordinator, said by phone Saturday as he drove with his family toward a campaign stop. He acknowledged difficulties created by Tuesday’s court ruling against granting additional time or assuring alternative parties a ballot spot given the the pandemic, but he insisted the campaign will prevail.</p>
<p>“I am about 100 percent convinced we are going to meet or exceed what we need,” he said.</p>
<p>Ms. Jorgensen scratched an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as logistical issues prompted cancellation of a midday appearance at the Washington County Fairgrounds. But Mr. Robb said Ms. Jorgensen was pressing ahead, with Saturday stops at Cedar Creek Park in Belle Vernon; Meadville's Diamond Park Square, along with Allegheny Commons on Pittsburgh’s North Side at 5 p.m.; then on Sunday, stops at the Erie County Courthouse in Erie, Veterans Memorial Park in Clarion; Sandy Township Recreational Park in DuBois; and Godspeed Hostel in State College.</p>
<p>Ms. Jorgensen, has worked in the software industry and as a consultant, taking time off to raise her two daughters, now grown. Currently, she is a senior lecturer in psychology at Clemson in South Carolina and has taught there full time since 2006.</p>
<p>She holds a 2002 doctorate in industrial/organizational psychology from Clemson, a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Baylor University and an MBA from Southern Methodist University, both in Texas.</p>
<p>A native of Libertyville, Ill., was the party’s 1996 vice presidential nominee in an election year that saw Democrat Bill Clinton secure a second White House term.</p>
<p>This year, her position points range from disproportionately high incarceration rates of racial minorities to harm that tariffs inflict on farmers.</p>
<p>On her website, the candidate asserts that the Democratic and Republicans parties have failed Americans and produced a legacy $26 trillion in debt; ongoing involvement in “expensive and deadly foreign” wars, soaring health care costs, top imprisonment rate in the world and a retirement system “unable to pay promised benefits.”</p>
<p>Face masks encouraged by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have emerged as a political issue, with Republicans and others on the right balking at being required to wear them in an effort to slow COVID-19’s spread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Robb could not predict what share of her supporters would be wearing masks for Saturday’s North Side rally.</p>
<p>“She has no problems with wearing a mask. She has no problem with not wearing a mask if that’s appropriate,” he said. “That’s something that should be left to the individual and individual businesses.”</p>
<p>He said he has not spoken with Ms. Jorgensen about Mr. Trump’s suggestion that the Nov. 3 presidential election be be delayed, but added,&nbsp;“I don’t see any reason why we should delay ...” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Jorgensen’s platform calls for ending the war on drugs, bringing U.S. troops home from foreign wars, drastically slashing federal spending and allowing for a truly free market in health care, with competition and the resultant lower prices.</p>
<p>Her campaign asserted that the Libertarian Party&nbsp; was on the ballot in 2016 and 2018, evidence of support that has become harder to solicit given COVID-19 fears and shutdown orders in various states. But the Third Circuit federal court ruled otherwise on their appeal.</p>
<p>“It seems that every other state has realized that physical petitioning in COVID times is a bad idea," said Mr. Robb. "It’s going to be hard, but if we keep up the pace we've been seeing over the past week, we will make it — and provide Pennsylvania voters a candidate they can vote for enthusiastically."</p>
