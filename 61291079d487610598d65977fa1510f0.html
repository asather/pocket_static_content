<h1>Penn State lands commitment from 4-star OL Landon Tengwall</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In an uncertain world, there was a bit of normalcy at State College on Thursday. Landon Tengwall, rated a four-star offensive tackle by Rivals, has committed to Penn State, choosing the Nittany Lions over Notre Dame.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-6, 300-pounder out of Olney, Md., was also recruited by such Power Five schools as Auburn, Alabama, LSU, Florida, and Ohio State.</p>
<p>Tengwall is a top-100 recruit on several of the significant sites. Rivals has Tengwall at 27th overall and the fifth-best offensive tackle. 247Sports has him 77th overall and ESPN ranks him at 84th.</p>
<p>If there is a football season in 2020, there is a good chance Tengwall could contribute on the field as a true freshman.</p>
