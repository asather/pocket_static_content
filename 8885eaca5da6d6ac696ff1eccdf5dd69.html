<h1>Syracuse blows out Pitt on home court for Panthers' fifth consecutive loss</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt entered its game Wednesday against Syracuse as a desperate team, hungry not only for a win to snap a four-game losing streak, but restless to try to make something of a season that has careened in recent weeks.</p>
<p>With just three games left in the regular season and at two games over .500, the Panthers have only so many opportunities remaining. After Wednesday, none of those comes at home, where they’ve been significantly better this season. If there was going to be a meaningful push to make this season something more palatable, based on everything that had transpired to that point, it was going to be this game on this night.</p>
<p>It never came, and the team that Pitt should have been in such a situation — that its coach believed it should have been — never showed itself.</p>
<p>In what was possibly the most winnable game remaining on its schedule -- given where it was taking place and its opponent, which had gone 2-5 in its previous seven games -- Pitt was dominated in virtually every aspect of the matchup that it could have been, falling 72-49 to Syracuse at Petersen Events Center in a contest the home team was favored to win by one.</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed in our performance,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “I don’t think we had the required and necessary energy to start the game and throughout the game that’s necessary to win, especially for a team that has lost four games in a row.”</p>
<p>It was the Panthers’ fifth-consecutive loss and eighth in their past 10 games, a stretch that began with a 69-61 loss at the Orange on Jan. 25. In that time, their record has dropped from 13-6, which came with warranted optimism and hopes of a postseason appearance, to 15-14, with both of those aforementioned things dwindling to the point of vanishing. Only one of their past five losses -- a 59-56 setback last Saturday against Virginia, a game in which they trailed by 13 with fewer than four minutes remaining -- was decided by single digits.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom, perhaps incorrectly, dictates that a team, especially a relatively young one like Pitt, improves over the course of a season, as players get more familiar with one another, develop a shared bond and are hardened by the challenges thrown their way. Over the past couple of months, Capel hasn’t seen that from his group.</p>
<p>“I don’t,” he said when asked if he believes his team has improved in that span. “Over the past couple of months, no. A little bit. Slightly. Certainly not over the past month, I don’t think we have.”</p>
<p>It was also their seventh-consecutive loss to Syracuse, which they had beaten in six of the seven prior matchups, many of which came under former coach Jamie Dixon, who developed a penchant for dissecting the Orange’s 2-3 zone in the final years of his 13-year head-coaching tenure at the school.</p>
<p>The most recent of those stumbles came on a night in which, as Capel noted, the Panthers seemed to lack anything resembling intensity or urgency. It was something seen well beyond a single aspect of the game; it was everywhere, visible in virtually every motion a Pitt player made.</p>
<p>“As a team, we've got to come out the gate with more energy,” freshman forward Justin Champagnie said. “It probably starts with the warmups. We have to go through the warmups harder. We have to not move through the motions so slow and pick up the energy.”</p>
<p>Pitt’s offense continued to struggle in a way that makes such a word seem too light. It made just 29.1% of its shots, matching its worst single-game showing this season and marking the fifth-consecutive game in which it failed to go better than 39% from the field. In those games, it has shot just 34.4%. Additionally, it scored only 49 points on 70 possessions (an average of 0.7 per possession) Wednesday.</p>
<p>Champagnie, the team’s leading scorer and rebounder, had a team-high 13 points and 17 rebounds for the Panthers, even getting praise after the game from no less an authority than Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, who said the Brooklyn native is as good as any freshman in the ACC. But, as Capel said, “there’s more he can do.” Those numbers, great as they look on a box score, only tell so much of the story to his coach.</p>
<p>Though Pitt only led for 41 seconds, the game wasn’t always so lopsided and unsightly for it, as it trailed by just five, 24-19, after a 3-pointer from Ryan Murphy, his <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/02/24/pitt-panthers-basketball-ryan-murphy-syracuse-orange-jeff-capel-xavier-johnson/stories/202002240126" target="_blank">first made shot</a> from&nbsp;beyond the arc in more than a month, with 5:55 left in the half.</p>
<p>From there, however, the night became what the final score reflected. The Orange ended the half on a 13-2 run, getting nine of those points from the free-throw line while four Pitt players were saddled with two fouls apiece in the opening 17:23. By the end of that burst, Syracuse had built a 16-point lead going into the half, draining whatever enthusiasm and energy had previously been in the building.</p>
<p>The Panthers were unable to recover in the second half, never getting closer than 11 and trailing by 20 or more for 10:32 of the final 20 minutes.</p>
<p>It was an undeniably dispiriting showing for a team that needed something much more. From the opposite sideline, though, Boeheim sees a program moving on from the depths of the misery that Capel inherited.</p>
<p>“It just doesn’t happen overnight,” Boeheim said. “To say they were rock bottom isn’t even a close approximation of where they were when Jeff took over. They were below that.”</p>
<p>The Panthers are in a better spot where they once were. Even with the five-consecutive losses, they have nearly matched their ACC regular-season win total from the previous three seasons combined.</p>
<p>That doesn’t make nights like Wednesday easier to accept, though, and for Capel, for all he is paid and for the stature he has, there’s only so much he can do to conjure something out of his team as it languishes toward the end of the season.</p>
<p>“There has to be self-motivation, too,” he said. “That has to be a part of it. We obviously didn’t see that tonight.”</p>
<p>If anything, that early success provided a glimpse at what might be possible, making these last several weeks that much harder to digest than if such hopes had never sprouted at all.</p>
<p>With only two games remaining before the ACC tournament, Pitt is in a predicament of its own making. Whether there’s a way out of it will be up to them and their ability to recapture something that appears, at least at this point, to be lost.</p>
<p>“I’m worried about everything and I’ve been worried about everything since we’ve been losing,” Capel said. “I think a coach’s nature is to worry. When things aren’t going right, you probably tend to worry a little bit more. Even when things are going well, you worry that ‘Man, I hope it continues to go well. We have to keep this.’ These seasons are long. As you get into February, that becomes the grind for every team, every program in the country. You have to be mentally tough enough and physically tough enough to be able to push through.”</p>
