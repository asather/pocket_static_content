<h1>State high court to weigh in on Mount Washington billboard fight</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court will jump into the battle over a controversial Mount Washington billboard.</p>
<p>In an order issued Monday, justices agreed to hear part of the city’s appeal of a state Commonwealth Court panel’s ruling which found that a vinyl advertising banner draped over the billboard was legal.</p>
<p>However, in the order, the high court stated that arguments would be limited to one issue: Whether the Commonwealth Court decision was inconsistent with a separate ruling involving Lamar Advertising and Monroeville.</p>
<p>In that case, another three-judge Commonwealth Court panel concluded that electronic billboards and static vinyl billboards could not be substituted for one another because they are different uses.</p>
<p>The fact that the state Supreme Court will hear the case is a victory for the city in its fierce battle with Lamar over the Mount Washington billboard, which Mayor Bill Peduto has dubbed “an eyesore.” The city lost appeals at both the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court and state Commonwealth Court levels.</p>
<p>“We’re happy that the Supreme Court is taking this appeal,” said Timothy McNulty, Mr. Peduto’s spokesman.</p>
<p>Jonathan Kamin, Lamar’s attorney, was geared up for the latest round in the heavyweight bout.</p>
<p>“We’re happy that the Supreme Court took the case and look forward to defending the decisions of the Commonwealth Court and the trial court, both of whom found in our favor,” he said.</p>
<p>In August, a three-judge Commonwealth Court panel upheld a 2018 ruling by Common Pleas Senior Judge Joseph James, who reversed a city Zoning Board of Adjustment decision involving the billboard.</p>
<p>The zoning board had ruled that installing a 7,200-square-foot black and yellow vinyl static advertising banner for Sprint over a nonconforming 4,500-square-foot electronic sign violated a section of the zoning code.</p>
<p>But neither Judge James nor Commonwealth Court bought that argument.</p>
<p>In its appeal to the state Supreme Court, the city maintained that the ruling by the three-judge panel “directly contradicted” a separate decision by the same court involving Lamar billboards in Monroeville.</p>
<p>Only by ignoring that decision was the panel in the Mount Washington case able to conclude that the Pittsburgh zoning board erred in declaring that the vinyl banner violated the law, the city asserted.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Kamin maintained that the panel was right to disregard that ruling.</p>
<p>“We do not believe the Monroeville case is applicable to this situation. It’s a different municipality with a different ordinance and involved the erection of a new sign. We look forward to defending our position, once again, in court,” he said.</p>
<p>Lamar has contended that the Monroeville matter involved removing existing sign faces on billboards and replacing them with new LED sign faces. The court found that would result in&nbsp;“significant structural alterations,” by Lamar’s account.</p>
<p>On Mount Washington, by contrast, the vinyl sign is the same size as the existing billboard face, the electronic aspects of the billboard remain and have not been altered or removed, and the structure itself has not been altered or enlarged, the company maintained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The black-and-yellow Sprint banner on the Mount Washington billboard has since been replaced by a red, white and blue National Flag Foundation advertisement.</p>
