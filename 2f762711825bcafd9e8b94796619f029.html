<h1>How COVID-19 has hit close to home for Pitt assistant Tim O'Toole</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In Tim O’Toole’s office in Petersen Events Center is a collection of photographs that go as far back as 1987.</p>
<p>Inside each frame is a group shot of a college basketball team for which the Pitt assistant was a coach. Each snapshot serves a purpose. They’re a reminder that O’Toole isn’t getting any younger, but more than that, they’re a source of appreciation and a valued connection to the past. Each individual in each photo holds a memory and a story.</p>
<p>As the years and decades have passed, some of the coaches and even players with whom he stood for those photos are now dead. For some, it was old age. For others, some of whom perished on 9/11, their deaths were more sudden, unexpected and emotionally jarring.</p>
<p>“You see these things and it’s not supposed to happen,” O’Toole said. “They’re your teammates or guys who were younger than you or guys you coached. It hurts.”</p>
<p>Among that sea of faces frozen in time is a loss that’s still raw. Last month, Jonathan Duck, a forward who played at Iona College while O’Toole was an assistant coach at the school in the early 1990s, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/sports/basketball/coronavirus-college-basketball-players-ncaa.html" target="_blank">died at age 50 of COVID-19</a>, making an unfolding global pandemic resonate and hurt in a way it may not have otherwise.</p>
<p>Duck was one of two former college basketball players — the other being Lee Green, a guard at St. John’s in the early 1990s — from the New York City area who died from the novel coronavirus within two weeks of attending a March 14 birthday party for a friend at a cigar bar in Scarsdale, N.Y.</p>
<p>While together at Iona, O’Toole bestowed Duck with the nickname “Big Hands.” As it was with other players, O’Toole hoped it would be an identity he would embrace, almost like an actor immersing themselves in a role. He found himself drawn to a young man with an underdog spirit that he admired.</p>
<p>“He was just a space-eater,” O’Toole said. “He was built like Charles Barkley. He was probably 6-5, 260. Anything you threw in there he was going to grab with these monster hands. He had a love for the sport. He always had a big smile. A lot of big guys, you often see them and you’re scared of them. But once you really got to know him, he was a giant teddy bear.”</p>
<p>Shortly after Duck’s death, O’Toole came across an Instagram post from a New York-area AAU program expressing “our deepest condolences to the families of Jon Duck, Lee Green and Dave Edwards.” Later, someone passed along a New York Times story to him with the same, unbelievable bit of news.</p>
<p>“All the things you hear about the elderly and those are the people who are most vulnerable — Jon was in his late 40s,” O’Toole said. “Lee Green was late 40s. This wasn’t typical of what you might have thought about this virus.”</p>
<p>The seriousness of coronavirus, the danger it can present and the immense personal toll it can carry had, in reality, not been lost on O’Toole prior to Duck’s passing.</p>
<p>On the morning of Pitt’s March 10 victory against Wake Forest in the ACC tournament, O’Toole’s younger sister, Tiffany, was brought to Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she had been treated for her ovarian cancer, to be tested for COVID-19 after her oxygen levels had been dropping. With a compromised immune system after undergoing cancer treatments for the better part of two years, there was an overriding fear of what a positive test would mean for her.</p>
<p>“I just remember thinking that night here she is battling ovarian then she had a relapse then she’s running back down and being tested for corona,” O’Toole said. “I’m like ‘Man, enough’s enough.’ ”</p>
<p>Following the Panthers’ win, which snapped a seven-game losing streak, there was euphoria for the customarily high-energy O’Toole, but with that was a sense of dread for what might await him when he checked his phone in the team’s locker room. Nine years earlier, O’Toole had received a call from his sister informing him their older brother, Brendan, had died from an aortic rupture. He was just 55 years old.</p>
<p>In that moment, it was hard to focus on what his team had just accomplished. His mind was consumed by the fear that, yet again, he would grab his phone only to hear a sibling had died.</p>
<p>“Everyone around is fired up and rightfully so,” O’Toole said. “Then there was that grave realization that my phone might tell me something different. I was really, really scared.”</p>
<p>As he checked his phone, that panic vanished. Tiffany’s test had come back negative.</p>
<p>While the nightmare with his sister he had envisioned — the same one tens of thousands of families across the county have been forced to live through during the pandemic — didn’t materialize, the sense of loss O’Toole experienced with Duck and the panic he felt with his sister helped reinforce some of his beliefs.</p>
<p>“The reality is this — all of us need to appreciate what we have,” O’Toole said. “We all know, and it doesn’t matter your age, that one day, it could all be gone.”</p>
