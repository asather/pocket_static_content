<h1>Are you essential? Allegheny County mostly leaving it up to businesses to decide</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County, along with the state of Pennsylvania, have called upon all “nonessential businesses” to voluntarily close in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. But it’s still unclear exactly how county officials are determining who falls into that group.</p>
<p>That’s by design, said Allegheny County communications director Amie Downs.</p>
<p>“We’re not defining it. That’s something we’re encouraging businesses to take into consideration themselves,” she said.</p>
<p>Without knowing the ins and outs of every company and institution, “We’re very much reliant upon businesses making decisions that are in the best interest of their employees and clients,” she said.</p>
<p>If a company’s employees are still healthy, the county wants those businesses to still be able to practice social distancing — a new term that generally refers to keeping about six feet of space between you and other people to prevent the spread of the contagious virus.</p>
<p>People who work in small group settings can still continue to work “provided that there is space to remain separated from each other,” the county said in a press release Sunday announcing the recommendation.</p>
<p>The county’s recommendation was aimed at areas where people congregate together, including child care centers, senior centers and community and recreation centers.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County guidelines follow similar recommendations from the state, though Gov. Tom Wolf provided more concrete definitions of&nbsp;“essential” and&nbsp;“nonessential” institutions Monday night.</p>
<p>Nonessential businesses include&nbsp;“public facing industries” such as entertainment, hospitality and recreation facilities, according to a press release from the state.</p>
<p>Essential services include:&nbsp;“food processing, agriculture, industrial manufacturing, feed mills, construction, trash collection, grocery and household goods (including convenience stores), home repair/hardware and auto repair, pharmacy and other medical facilities, biomedical and healthcare, post offices and shipping outlets, insurance, banks, gas stations, laundromats, veterinary clinics and pet stores, warehousing, storage, and distribution, public transportation, and hotel and commercial lodging.”</p>
<p>Though these businesses can stay open, Mr. Wolf still advised them to employ social distance practices.</p>
<p>Other businesses — including&nbsp;“legal services, business and management consulting, professional services and insurance services” — are encouraged to have employees work remotely, the press release said.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a decision that I take lightly at all,” the governor said at his administration’s daily briefing on Monday. “It’s one that I’m making because medical experts believe it is the only way we can prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed by patients.”</p>
<p>Asked about daycare centers, the governor indicated that they fall under the shutdown order, but said his administration will not enforce their closure.</p>
<p>“At this point, we are calling for child care facilities to close, but we are not sending out the State Police or the National Guard to enforce this,” he said. “This is what they ought to do.”</p>
<p>As the number of COVID-19 cases in Pennsylvania continued to grow, Mr. Wolf extended his shutdown order to the entire state Monday afternoon. His announcement later that night stated that Philadelphia had separately provided guidance for businesses and businesses in Philadelphia County should follow the city’s guidance.</p>
<p>As of Monday afternoon, Allegheny County did not have a marker for when, or if, the voluntary closure recommendation could switch to a mandate, Ms. Downs said.</p>
