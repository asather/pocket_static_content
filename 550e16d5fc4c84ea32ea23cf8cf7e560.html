<h1>Women's Marchers urge importance of 2020 vote</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Though they were motivated by a variety of causes and candidates, the hundreds gathered Downtown Saturday for the Women's March had one overriding message: Vote.</p>
<p>The march, now in its fourth year, has been one of the most visible expressions of Trump-era women's political activism.</p>
<p>Several marchers carried American flags and many held hand-letters signs on poster board with slogans like, “A woman's place is in the White House,” “Rise up,” “No War,” “Vote Blue No Matter Who,” and “Only 289 Days until Nov. 3.”</p>
<p>Bundled up in hats, coats and ponchos against the rain and cold, the crowd gathered at the City-County Building before marching to Market Square.</p>
<p>“It's a beautiful day to change the system,” said Emily Kinkead, a candidate for the state House, to cheers from the crowd.</p>
<p>She was one of a host of candidates and elected officials who spoke Saturday.&nbsp;Among them were Democratic office-holders, and in some cases, the Democratic primary candidates looking to unseat them, such as State Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Forest Hills, and his challenger Bill Brittain.</p>
<p>“In 2018, we flipped the U.S. House, in 2020, we are going to flip the Pennsylvania House and the Pennsylvania Senate, with your help,” said state Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Squirrel Hill, referring to Republican control of both legislative chambers in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>Among the speakers were two officials who have <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2019/04/03/democrat-pam-iovino-pennsylvania-state-senate-raja-suburban-women/stories/201904030187" target="_blank">benefited from a surge of suburban women activists and volunteers, state Sen. Pam Iovino, D-Mt. Lebanon, and Congressman Conor Lamb</a>, D-Mt. Lebanon, who both thanked the crowd.</p>
<p>“I love you all for what you do and for who you are,” Ms. Iovino said.</p>
<p>Marcher Becky Jones said she was there because she fears an emboldened President Donald Trump, should he win a second term in November.</p>
<p>Rev. Patricia Brown, of Wilkinsburg, said she was marching because of the importance of the 2020 election and “the importance of getting the vote out.”</p>
<p>Between events in Washington D.C., and those locally, Saturday was the fourth Women's March Lori Holt has attended, though she also stressed the importance of other political activities to get voters to the polls, such as canvassing for candidates.</p>
<p>“It's not just the march,” she said.</p>
