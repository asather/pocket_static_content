<h1>'Who gets to tell the story?': Decolonizing history at the Racial Justice Summit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>&nbsp;If decolonizing history sounds like a lot for one day, the Pittsburgh Racial Justice Summit was jam-packed with trying.</p>
<p>“Who gets to tell the story?” was a question repeated and reframed throughout the halls of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary on Saturday, during workshops on environmental justice, housing discrimination, art representation, and even algorithms.</p>
<p>Carl Redwood Jr., a community organizer in the Hill District who grew up around the corner from the Highland Ave. venue, opened with an example from his youth.</p>
<p>Everyday, he’d walk past a sign that declared the establishment of Highland Park, “settled in 1778.”</p>
<p>The story that sign told was about Alexander Negley, a Swiss soldier and blacksmith who became the first white settler to make a home in this part of East Liberty, an area that is now, again, quickly gentrifying.</p>
<p>The indigenous people who were here before Negley and who were displaced from this river valley by similar settlements aren’t considered in that sign, Mr. Redwood said.</p>
<p>“Who gets to tell the story? All of us get to tell the story,” proclaimed Tarek Abuata, a Palestinian-born activist who moved to Houston when he was six.</p>
<p>His history of the founding of the State of Israel was much different than the history that Rabbi Brant Rosen, of Chicago, learned from stories of his parents and grandparents.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosen, sitting next to Mr. Abuata, talked about how that history changed over time, as he started to listen to the stories of individual Palestinians.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Racial Justice Summit, in its 22nd iteration this year, is put on by the Black and White Reunion, an organization founded in 1996, a year after the death of Jonny Gammage. Mr. Gammage, a black driver, died of asphyxiation in the custody of police in suburban Pittsburgh during a traffic stop.</p>
<p>This year, the gathering was dedicated to a mainstay of the Black and White Reunion, Ann Mason, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2019/11/20/ANN-FLOBERG-MASON-obituary/stories/201911200157" target="_blank">who died in November.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“She was just a human being who bridged the gap between races,” <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/thedigs/2016/02/24/tim-stevens-singing-activist/" target="_blank">Tim Stevens</a>, a co-founder of the summit and CEO of the Black Political Empowerment Project, said of his friend. “Today you’re here to emulate the work of Ann Mason.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The organizing committee initially intended to name the summit “1619 to 2020,” a reference to the year when African people were brought to the United States as slaves and the subject of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/19/magazine/history-slavery-smithsonian.html" target="_blank">massive New York Times project</a> that frames all major aspects of modern American life as a linear result of 246 years of slavery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, the title was changed to 1492 to 2020, to take into account the indigenous people who were displaced and colonized with the arrival of Christopher Columbus in North America at the end of the 15th Century.</p>
<p>It was a theme of the day to pan out further.</p>
<p>Alex Jackson, a student at Carnegie Mellon University, drew a line from history into the digital future in a workshop about the biases built into algorithms that govern increasingly more aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>“Data [is] most the valuable product we have right now,” Ms. Jackson said.</p>
<p>When data reflects the results of institutions that were built on racism and inequality, using biased data to make predictions will lead to biased predictions, she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Jackson spoke about predictive algorithms used by police departments and judges to inform which neighborhoods get more enforcement or which individuals in the criminal justice system are likely to offend again.</p>
<p>“You’re basing these algorithms on historical trends,” she said, which perpetuates a loop. Except “now you have it with this ‘objectivity’ — a computer is telling me I should be going out and policing these neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>Algorithms that assume the less an insurance company has paid out, the healthier the insured must be, are being used to make decisions about interventions and treatment that end up biased against minority populations that have historically received worse healthcare and worse health insurance coverage, Ms. Jackson said.</p>
<p>“Discrimination from our past is now being encoded,” she said.</p>
<p>The results of red-lining and credit discrimination are now encoded into algorithms that govern bank loans and interest rates.</p>
<p>“Those things have never been corrected in our society and so they’re going to show up in algorithms,” Ms. Jackson cautioned.</p>
<p>Speakers drew attention to historical patterns but urged participants not to resign to them. Mr. Stevens has asked for a list of action steps from each workshop that he hopes to post of the website of the Black and White Reunion in the near future.</p>
