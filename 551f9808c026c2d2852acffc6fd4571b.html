<h1>Want a Pa. voter mail-in ballot? Here's how you can get one. </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Though the Pennsylvania legislature postponed the state’s primary election until June 2, state and local officials continue to advise voters to apply for mail-in ballots if they feel uncertain about voting in person.</p>
<p>Even before the spread of COVID-19 and its impact on social gatherings, the 2020 primary was going to be the first election in Pennsylvania in which mail-in ballots were allowed. Now, they’re being framed as the logical alternative for those who don’t want to wait to see if in-person voting is viable come June.</p>
<p>So, how do you do it?</p>
<p>First, you have to make sure you’re registered to vote in Pennsylvania by typing your name, date of birth, county and zip code into <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx" target="_blank">this online portal</a>. If it says you’re&nbsp;“active,” you can vote by mail. If not, you have until May 18 to register to vote by filling out <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx" target="_blank">this online application</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you’re registered, you have until May 26 at 5 p.m. to apply for a mail-in ballot. Unlike traditional absentee ballots, you aren’t required to list an excuse for why you want to vote in this manner.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to apply:</p>
<p><strong>Apply online.</strong></p>
<p>To do this, go to <a href="/VotesPa.com/ApplyMailBallot" target="_blank">VotesPa.com/ApplyMailBallot</a> and fill out the online form. Make sure you have your Pennsylvania driver’s license or PennDOT-issued photo ID handy. You’ll need it to apply. If you don’t have either of those, or cannot provide the last four digits of your Social Security Number, you can submit an acceptable photo ID from the list <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Documents/DOS_Identification_for_absentee_voting.pdf" target="_blank">found here</a>, or consult <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Mail-and-Absentee-Ballot.aspx" target="_blank">this page’</a>s FAQs&nbsp;for a list of exemptions.</p>
<p>Remember, you must complete this form by 5 p.m. on May 26. That’s the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Fill out a paper application and mail it to your county elections office.</strong></p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/election/2020?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/05/2020-election-banner-insert-landing-page" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>For people who don’t have a computer or are facing other complications with the online form, you can download a paper application and fill it out by hand.</p>
<p>Here is the application <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Register-to-Vote/Documents/PADOS_MailInApplication.pdf" target="_blank">in English</a> and here it is <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Register-to-Vote/Documents/PADOS_MailInApplication_Spanish.pdf" target="_blank">in Spanish</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, you’ll have to write in your driver’s license number or PennDOT photo ID card number. If you don’t have those, the last four digits of your Social Security number will suffice. If you don’t have that, you’ll have to attach a photocopy of an acceptable ID from the list&nbsp;<a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Documents/DOS_Identification_for_absentee_voting.pdf" target="_blank">found here</a>,&nbsp;or consult&nbsp;<a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Mail-and-Absentee-Ballot.aspx" target="_blank">this page’</a>s FAQs&nbsp;for a list of exemptions.</p>
<p>Once your application is complete, mail it to your county elections office. Addresses for each election office <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Resources/Pages/Contact-Your-Election-Officials.aspx" target="_blank">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>You also can apply in person at your county election office, or by sending a signed letter that includes the same information requested in the application.</p>
<p>Once your application is approved, your county election office will send you instructions on how to officially obtain the ballot.</p>
<p>During the application process, you also will have the option to request to be added to a list of annual ballot requests, which will ensure that you receive an application to renew your mail-in ballot every year — making it so you don’t have to submit a new application for each separate election.</p>
