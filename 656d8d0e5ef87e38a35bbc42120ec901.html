<h1>Paul Zeise: Eventually, the Pirates will need to spend some money to win</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Trading Starling Marte to Arizona was the right move for 2020. The Pirates absolutely needed to restock their minor league system, and they aren’t close enough to winning to justify Marte’s price tag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are officially rebuilding, but there are already some solid young players on the roster to build around. That means the Pirates shouldn’t need four or five years to get this turned around.</p>
<p>A caller on my radio show Monday night, though, posed an important question in all of this: “What is the Pirates’ endgame?”</p>
<p>I’m not sure anyone can honestly answer that based on the precedent that has been set. The Pirates say their endgame is to deliver a World Series championship, but is ownership really willing to do what it takes to make it happen? The past suggests no, but I’m willing to be open-minded that the future will be different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pirates need to continue to acquire young talent; whatever happens this year in terms of wins and losses is meaningless. The Pirates should look to move any veteran they think can bring back something in the form of prospects. Those trades can happen now or at the trade deadline, whenever the best deals come along.</p>
<p>At that point, the Pirates will be stripped down to the bare minimum and looking to actually begin the process of building a championship team. The young players who remain will serve as the foundation for that process.</p>
<p>It’s a pipe dream, however,&nbsp;to believe that all of these prospects and young players are going to turn into legitimate major league players. It’s also a pipe dream to believe they can all be ready to produce at the same time or stay healthy and avoid major injuries.</p>
<p>That’s where Bob Nutting will be on the clock. And that’s when we can answer the question of whether or not he is willing to do what it takes to win a World Series. At that point he needs to be willing to spend money — real money&nbsp;— on real players to fill holes to try and put them over the top.</p>
<p>The Milwaukee Brewers are a great example of what I’m talking about. They did the “Strip it down and rebuild” routine a few years ago. They acquired prospects, traded their bigger name veterans and tried to save some money for the day when they were ready to win.</p>
<p>One thing they did differently, though, is lock up Ryan Braun to a long-term deal in hopes that he would be the backbone of the team and the player they could build around. The deal was for five years, $105 million, and that is far bigger than any deal the Pirates have ever offered a player.</p>
<p>A second thing they did differently is, as they began to get better, they used their prospects and money to fill holes. They made trades to get Christian Yelich and Mike Moustakas. They signed Lorenzo Cain to a five-year, $80 million deal. Then they needed a catcher and signed Yasmani Grandal to a one-year $18 million deal.</p>
<p>Milwaukee hasn’t won a World Series with that core, but they’ve won a division title (the Pirates haven’t done that since 1992) and a playoff series (the Pirates haven’t done that since 1979) and got to the NLCS. They’ve done all this despite being a&nbsp;“small market” team.</p>
<p>The Pirates have never shown this kind of commitment to winning under Nutting, and there will be a point where they will need to do something similar in the near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it’s fair to ask: is Bob Nutting going to be willing to pay a player $15 million to $20 million to fill a hole? Is he going to be willing to take the payroll to more than $110 million if that’s what it takes? Is he going to be willing to lock up one of the team’s young superstars to have a foundation player to build around?</p>
<p>All of these questions are impossible to answer now. The “endgame” is a few years off, but if that doesn’t include spending some real money on the payroll, then the Pirates are wasting all of our time.</p>
