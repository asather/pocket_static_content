<h1>WPIAL wrestlers dominate quarterfinals of PIAA individual wrestling championships</h1>

<p>HERSHEY, Pa. — Nobody is safe in Chocolate Town in the first week of March.</p>
<p>Year in and year out, several unheralded WPIAL wrestlers make their way into Giant Center and unleash chaos on the opening day of the PIAA individual wrestling championships. This year was no different.</p>
<p>Hempfield junior Ethan Berginc wasted no time busting the 113-pound bracket in Class 3A. After pinning Liberty’s Javien DeLeon in his pigtail match to advance to the round of 16, Berginc (34-6) stunned No. 2 seed Ben Monn of Cumberland Valley, 3-2.</p>
<p>“I did a lot of research on him the whole week,” Berginc said. “I knew I had a chance. He’s really good defensively, but I knew if I was able to create angles, I would be able to set up at least one shot, and it happened.”</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, Waynesburg sophomore Cole Homet (41-13) pinned Spring Ford’s Quinn Tobin in his pigtail match at 132 pounds, then used a dramatic third-period comeback to knock off No. 2 seed Matt Sarbo of Altoona, 9-6.</p>
<p>“I just kicked it into another gear,” Homet said. “I ran my hips through him and I got him on his back, and I just laid on him for the rest of the time.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a pair of top-five seeds went down on day one at 138 pounds courtesy of WPIAL wrestlers.</p>
<p>Norwin junior John Altieri (38-5) eliminated No. 5 seed Dominic Frontino of Shippensburg by way of a 7-2 decision, while Seneca Valley junior Chanz Shearer (37-9) took out Central Dauphin’s Bryce Buckman, 11-5, in his pigtail match before routing No. 3 seed Kibwe McNair of Methacton via a 16-6 major decision.</p>
<p>“It’s my first time wrestling here. I couldn’t be more grateful,” Shearer said. “Last year, breaking my wrist and not being able to wrestle in the postseason, and then coming here and wrestling as hard as I can and just hoping I can achieve my goals. ... It was nerve-racking.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t even imagine that it was real.”</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it — the WPIAL brought plenty of known commodities to Hershey as well. Of the 14 weight classes in Class 3A, half of the No. 1 seeds were WPIAL wrestlers — and all seven advanced to Friday’s quarterfinal round.</p>
<p>Defending state champion Carter Dibert (38-2), a junior from Franklin Regional, defeated Connellsville’s Mason Prinkey (33-8), 9-0, in his first-round match at 113 pounds. Another top seed, Seneca Valley junior Dylan Chappell (46-4), then eked out a 1-0 decision against Canon-McMillan junior Costa Moore (30-13) at 120 pounds.</p>
<p>At 126 pounds, Norwin senior Kurtis Phipps (37-1) got his final trip to Hershey off to a scorching start with a 16-1 technical fall against Bethlehem Catholic’s Andrew Harmon. Phipps is a two-time PIAA runner-up.</p>
<p>Seneca Valley junior Alejandro Herrera-Rondon (40-3) is seeking his third PIAA title in as many years, though he bumped up three weight classes to 132 pounds this year. He advanced to the quarterfinals with a 9-1 major decision against Strath Haven’s Chase Barlow.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely a big jump, but I think I feel like I’m getting more used to it,” Herrera-Rondon said.</p>
<p>The other top seeds to advance from the WPIAL were Hempfield junior Ty Linsenbigler (39-2), Canon-McMillan senior Gerrit Nijenhuis (44-0) and Mt. Lebanon senior Luke Stout (39-0). Linsenbigler defeated Penn Manor’s Dylan Coleman via 13-3 major decision at 145 pounds, while Nijenhuis and Stout scored pins at 182 and 195 pounds, respectively.</p>
<p>All in all, 34 WPIAL wrestlers reached the quarterfinals in Class 3A.</p>
<p>Burgettstown’s Riley Kemper hoped to end his career with back-to-back WPIAL titles, but had those dreams dashed when Laurel’s Mitch Miles pinned him in the finals of the WPIAL Class 2A championships. Now, after a third-place finish at the Southwest Regional, he’s turned his attention to making it onto the podium in Hershey for the first time.</p>
<p>So far, so good for Kemper, who came back from a 3-2 deficit in the third period of his first-round match against Mifflinburg’s Emmanuel Ulrich to send it to overtime. There, the 285-pound senior drove Ulrich to his back to score a pin and earn his first trip to the quarterfinals, where he’ll face No. 1 seed and defending PIAA champion Colby Whitehill of Brookville on Friday morning.</p>
<p>“He’s the top guy in the nation. He’s the top dude. Everyone is chasing him,” Kemper said. “The goal is to be a state champ. If not, you shouldn't be here.”</p>
<p>While Kemper provided the most exciting finish among WPIAL wrestlers in the opening session, each of the district’s top-seeded wrestlers advanced without much drama.</p>
<p>At 160 pounds, Frazier senior Thayne Lawrence (22-0) rolled into the quarterfinals with a first-period pin against Brockway’s Noah Bash as he attempts to win his third consecutive PIAA title. Meanwhile, Ellwood City senior Austin Walley (42-1), the No. 1 seed at 182 pounds, defeated Slippery Rock’s Vito Polisi in his first-round match via a 21-6 technical fall.</p>
<p>The WPIAL’s remaining Southwest Regional champions, South Park junior Joey Fischer (42-2) and Elizabeth Forward senior Ryan Michaels (43-2), also cruised past their first-round opponents on Thursday morning to reach the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Overall, 11 WPIAL wrestlers advanced to Friday’s quarterfinals in Class 2A.</p>
