<h1>County responds to community speculation about the death of McKeesport woman</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As rumors continued to circulate regarding the circumstances of a transgender woman’s May 26 death in McKeesport, Allegheny County released information Monday regarding the investigation</p>
<p>The county, which typically does not release details about a person’s death unless there is a crime or the suspicion of a crime, said “in this case an exception is being made given the high-profile nature of the event” and questions that&nbsp;“surfaced in the community.”</p>
<p>Aaliyah Johnson, 32, died after falling out of the window to her ninth floor apartment at a building on Sinclair Street.</p>
<p>While police maintained that foul play was not suspected, members of the community said Ms. Johnson had been receiving death threats.</p>
<p>More than a week after Ms. Johnson’s death, protesters marched through McKeesport calling for a more thorough investigation.</p>
<p>The county said security video showed Ms. Johnson exiting the elevator on the ninth floor and entering her apartment at 7:04 a.m. The door and hallway are clearly visible in the video, the county said. It also said the video revealed “that no one else either entered or exited her apartment during the night, or during the time between her return to her apartment until police arrived at the apartment at 8:28 a.m.</p>
<p>“As a result,” the county said,&nbsp;“detectives can say conclusively that she was alone at the time she exited the apartment window.”</p>
<p>According to the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office, Ms. Johnson died from blunt impact injuries of the head and neck. The manner of death was ruled a suicide.</p>
<p>“Our hope is that this definitive determination along with additional investigative details will provide some answers to the family and loved ones of Aaliyah Johnson,” the county said.</p>
<p><em>An earlier version of this story misstated the time Ms. Johnson entered her apartment. Also the agency that ruled on the manner of death is clarified.</em></p>
