<h1>Meadows Racetrack &amp; Casino to reopen Tuesday </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Meadows Racetrack &amp; Casino has announced plans to reopen Tuesday for the first time in nearly three months, which would make it the first of the state’s 12 casinos to do so since they were ordered closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In a statement, Meadows General Manager Tony Frabbiele said the Washington County facility plans to reopen at noon.</p>

<p>“We have been working closely with the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, state and local leaders, and public health officials to finalize comprehensive reopening protocols and new health and safety precautions. We look forward to sharing details of our property-specific procedures in advance of reopening and welcoming back our team members and customers,” the statement read.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the PGCB said the Meadows is able to reopen because Washington County is among 16 counties scheduled to go to the state’s green phase of reopening with restrictions as of Friday.</p>
<p>The Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh is expected to announce soon, possibly as early as today, its plans for reopening. Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin in Farmington, Fayette County, the only other casino in a county that will turn green Friday, has not indicated to the PCGB its plans for reopening.</p>
<p>Among the state’s restrictions for reopening casinos and other entertainment facilities such as theaters and shopping malls is that they allow only 50% occupancy.</p>
<p>In a 10-page list of protocols for reopening sent to casinos last month in anticipation of the lifting of restrictions, the PGCB said it “desires to assure that reopenings occur in a manner which promotes the safety of casino patrons and employees alike as well as assure an environment conducive to proper regulatory oversight.”</p>
<p>All patrons and casino employees will be required to wear masks, social distance, limit personal contact while the casino enforces strict cleaning and disinfecting regimens to comply with all guidance and protocols issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Pennsylvania Department of Health.</p>
<p>Additionally, these protocols apply:</p>
<p>• The casino shall place signage at each entrance point reminding patrons of CDC guidelines for social distancing practices, proper washing of hands, use of sanitizers, wearing masks, and to stay at home if feeling ill or sick.</p>
<p>• The casino shall consider implementing methods for identifying persons who have a fever or other symptom of illness and not permitting those persons to access the casino gaming floor.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The casino staff stationed at entrance points shall receive training in recognizing possible signs of persons who may be ill, and shall be instructed to routinely ask such persons if they have had a fever, had contact with anyone with the COVID-19 virus within the past 14 days, and whether they are feeling ill. An affirmative answer to any of these questions shall result in refusing admittance to the casino on that day.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The casino shall place sanitizer stations at each entrance as well as throughout the casino floor which shall include hand sanitizer solution as well as sanitizing wipes for patrons to use both on themselves as well as on surfaces with which they may come into contact.</p>
<p>• The casino shall place markings on the floor in all areas in which patrons may form lines for entry or services. The marking shall be designed to maintain a social distancing of six feet in between patrons.</p>
<p>• The casino shall place markings and or queueing devices outside the entrances of the casino in areas in which patrons may form lines or queues for entry to the casino. The marking or queuing devices shall be designed to maintain a social distancing of patrons.</p>
<p>• Patrons not complying with protocols shall be warned and if they do not comply shall be asked to leave the casino.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The casino shall implement procedures to ensure facility occupancy rates are sufficient to maintain social distancing guidelines consistent with CDC and PA DOH guidance.</p>
<p>Each casino must identify a Pandemic Safety Officer who will report any employee with a confirmed or presumptive case of COVID-19 to the PGCB and the state health department.</p>
<p>As for slot machines, casinos are required to promote social distancing by one or more of the following:</p>
<p>• Installing a plexiglass barrier between machines</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Removing chairs from certain machines</p>
<p>• Disabling certain slot machines to create distance between operating machines.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Other methods as approved by the PGCB executive director.</p>
<p>Table games will be operated in a manner to maintain increased distance between players at each table and in a manner to prevent persons not playing at a table from congregating in close proximity to those who are.</p>
<p>Poker rooms are not authorized to operate under the COVID-19 protocols. And valet services will be discontinued until revised guidance is received.</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt the casino industry an unexpected and unprecedented blow over the last few months,” the protocol document concludes. “The board is committed to assisting each of Pennsylvania’s licensed casino operators and facilities to reopen in a safe and efficient manner consistent with CDC and PADOH guidelines.</p>
<p>“We fully anticipate that we will work together to rebuild this industry to again be a leading economic engine for Pennsylvania and to restore the first-rate entertainment facilities each of our licensees have developed.”</p>
