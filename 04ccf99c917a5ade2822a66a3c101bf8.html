<h1>Mohawk girls win first WPIAL Class 3A championship</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mohawk had never played in the WPIAL girls basketball championship game, but the Warriors certainly made the most of their first appearance.</p>
<p>Junior guard Nadia Lape scored five of her game-high 14 points in the second quarter to lead a balanced Mohawk (22-3) attack as the second-seeded Warriors won their first title in school history with a 44-26 victory over Section 1 rival and No. 1 Beaver (21-4) in the WPIAL Class 3A final at Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>Beaver and Mohawk had played twice in the regular season and split the two meetings.</p>
<p>Mohawk took control of the game in the second quarter when Beaver opened the period 0 for 8 from the floor and 2 for 13 in the quarter. The Warriors, meanwhile, opened the second quarter on an 8-0 run and, eventually led 21-9 at the intermission.</p>
<p>Emma Pavelek led Beaver with 10 points.</p>
