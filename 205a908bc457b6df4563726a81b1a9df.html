<h1>'Pittsburgh kid' Neil Walker's next task: surviving Philadelphia</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If the hockey team that plays its games across a few parking lots from where Neil Walker will work this summer ever invites him and his teammates to a game, Walker has a pretty good idea how that will go.</p>
<p>For a proud Pittsburgher who will soon call Philadelphia home, at least for the summer, Walker will probably remain quiet.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah. I’m going to keep my opinions about the Penguins and the Flyers on the down low when I’m over there,” said Walker, who signed a minor-league deal Wednesday with the Phillies, one that includes a spring training invite to big-league camp. “But I’m definitely excited. I think it’ll be a good opportunity.”</p>
<p>The deal makes a decent amount of sense for Walker, 34, who slashed .261/.344/.395 in 381 plate appearances over 115 games with the Marlins last season. After many of the bigger free agents signed, Walker and his agent took stock of which teams might need a veteran bench piece, and Philadelphia was atop the list.</p>
<p>A big part of that was the Phillies having plenty of talent — more than their .500 record in 2019 would indicate — but it also meant seeing a few familiar faces.</p>
<p>Andrew McCutchen will return from a torn ACL. Francisco Liriano also signed a one-year deal Wednesday. Josh Harrison, who signed with the Phillies in November, is one of eight or so players with whom Walker will compete for one of two remaining bench spots. Together, they’ll surely talk about their time together with the Pirates.</p>
<p>“It’ll be really cool,” Walker said. “Obviously we were all pretty close from 2013-15. We had a really good camaraderie, so I’m really looking forward to getting back in touch with them on a more personal level. I know some front-office people and scouts, too. The familiarity is pretty good as far as that’s concerned.”</p>
<p>The Phillies could use Walker’s versatility. Over the past two seasons, Walker has played first base, second base, third base, left field and right field. Last year, he went 11-for-34 (.324) in 33 games where he entered as a substitute, posting a 1.013 OPS. Over an 11-year career, Walker has a .267 batting average with 149 home runs, 606 RBIs and a .766 OPS in 1,288 games.</p>
<p>Playing this season will likely enable Walker to eclipse 10 years of service time, which serves as an important marking point. And although Walker will turn 35 in September, he’s not calling this a farewell tour.</p>
<p>“If I’m healthy, I’ll probably going to continue to try and play,” Walker said. “If I slow down, I feel beat up and get hurt, then maybe I might consider doing something else. But I don’t have it in my brain that this is my last year. That’s just not something that I’m entertaining at this moment.”</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, it seemed plausible that Walker could return to Pittsburgh, perhaps on a one-year deal to finish his career here. Given the aforementioned versatility, Walker — who in 2019 upped his OPS by 75 points from the previous season — could possibly have played an important role helping some of the Pirates’ younger position players mature.</p>
<p>However, even though Walker had some cursory conversations with Pirates general manager Ben Cherington, those talks never really got off the ground. Walker also seemed to hint that Cherington has a couple moves coming.</p>
<p>“It just didn’t add up,” Walker said. “We did talk a little bit, but it was pretty vague. It sounded like Ben had a lot on his plate from the time he took over, and he just wasn’t able to commit a spot.</p>
<p>“It sounds like they still have some things in the works. He didn’t know what the roster was going to look like with all those things combined. We did have a little bit of communication, but it was very minimal. Just like, ‘Is there a possibility that this could work?’ When we both were looking at it, it just didn’t make a ton of sense. Maybe that changes moving forward into next year. It just didn’t really add up going into this year.”</p>
<p>The first and last months of the baseball season might be a little tough on Walker, who remains a Penguins season ticket holder and used to play in their staff hockey games, held during the afternoons of weekday home games.</p>
<p>Walker is also neighbors with Penguins assistant general manager Jason Karmanos and makes no bones about where his hockey loyalties lie. They’re definitely not in the eastern part of the state.</p>
<p>“If I have to go to a Flyers game,” Walker said, “I’m going to be sitting in the back row pretty quiet, no doubt about that.”</p>
