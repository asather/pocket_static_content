<p>WASHINGTON —&nbsp;The U.S. Senate voted Wednesday to confirm&nbsp;Christy Wiegand, an assistant U.S. attorney based in Pittsburgh,&nbsp;as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The confirmation fills the 10-judge&nbsp;Western District bench for the first time since April 2013, after a flurry of appointments by President Donald Trump pushed through by a Republican-controlled Senate in recent years. Ms. Wiegand is the fifth judge confirmed to the district court by the Senate since last July.</p>
<p>Ms. Wiegand, 44, of Pittsburgh, was confirmed by an 82-14 vote.&nbsp;Both Pennsylvania senators, Republican Pat Toomey and Democrat Bob Casey, voted to approve the nomination and released a joint statement after the vote.</p>
<p>“Her many years of experience as an Assistant U.S. Attorney demonstrate her dedication to public service,” Mr. Toomey stated.&nbsp;“I am confident Ms. Wiegand’s experience, intellect, and dedication to a just and fair legal system will serve her and the people of Pennsylvania well.”</p>
<p>“I am pleased that Christy Wiegand has been confirmed to serve on the federal bench in Pennsylvania's Western District,” Mr. Casey added. “She has the intellect, experience and integrity to faithfully and independently administer justice for the people of the Commonwealth.”</p>
<p>Ms. Wiegand has served since 2004 in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, where she has prosecuted a variety of crimes, including large-scale drug trafficking, child exploitation, illegal firearms and fraud.</p>
<p>Ms. Wiegand recently prosecuted a case against a Pittsburgh man accused of distributing heroin and fentanyl that resulted in the deaths of drug users.</p>
<p>Previously, Ms. Wiegand served as a law clerk to Judge D. Brooks Smith of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. She received her undergraduate degree from Princeton University and her law degree from Cornell Law School. She was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/02/05/Trump-nominates-assistant-U-S-attorney-to-federal-judgeship-in-Western-Pennsylvania/stories/202002050140" target="_blank">nominated to the federal bench</a> in February.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has been working for years with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to reshape the U.S. judiciary with conservative judges.</p>
<p>In recent years, as many as six of the 10 judgeships were left empty at one time, requiring semi-retired judges to step in and address the caseload, Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who regularly follows Pennsylvania judicial nominees, told the Post-Gazette in July.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Senate has confirmed four other Western Pennsylvania district judges over the last year or so.</p>
<p>William Scott Hardy, a Pittsburgh attorney who represents businesses on labor and employment matters, was approved by a 65-30 vote in July.</p>
<p>In December 2019, senators voted 66-27 to confirm Robert J. Colville, a 54-year-old judge on the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, to the federal bench.</p>
<p>That followed the unanimous confirmation in September 2019 of Stephanie Haines, a 49-year-old assistant U.S. attorney based in Johnstown, and the 80-14 vote to confirm J. Nicholas Ranjan, a 41-year-old Pittsburgh lawyer, in July 2019.</p>
<p>But federal judges, who in Senate confirmation hearings pledge to be impartial, are not guaranteed to side with the president who appointed them or the political party that confirmed them.</p>
<p>In June, the Trump campaign joined Pennsylvania Republicans in Congress to file a federal lawsuit in Pittsburgh challenging the state’s mail-in voting system. The case was assigned to Judge Ranjan, who&nbsp;demanded the Trump campaign submit evidence of widespread fraud caused by mail-in voting.</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/08/23/Trump-campaign-files-its-evidence-in-mail-voting-suit/stories/202008220065" target="_blank">Trump campaign’s filing</a>, Judge Ranjan put the case on hold pending the outcome of lawsuits in state courts.</p>
