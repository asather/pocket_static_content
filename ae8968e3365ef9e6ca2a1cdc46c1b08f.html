<h1>Warner Bros. postpones ‘Tenet’ release in U.S. in sign of coronavirus concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Warner Bros. announced Monday that it will not release its much-anticipated Christopher Nolan movie “Tenet” in the United States on Aug. 12 as planned, delaying the American debut until at least September as coronavirus pandemic continues ravaging much of the country.</p>
<p>The announcement, however, suggested that the film might open earlier overseas - a development that would be a major break with recent practice. The move marks a hoisting of a white flag for a studio that had hoped to charge ahead while many other studios had long since surrendered. Disney, the only other major studio with a movie scheduled in the next six weeks, is also expected to postpone its two August films, “New Mutants” and “Mulan.”</p>
<p>With coronavirus cases surging in California and other large states, no major new films are likely to be released in the United States until at least September, depriving consumers of entertainment and theaters of badly needed revenue.</p>

<p>Warner Bros. executives said they had no choice as they looked at the landscape.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful for the support we’ve received from exhibitors and remain steadfast in our commitment to the theatrical experience around the world,” Toby Emmerich, chairman of the studio’s Pictures Group, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the pandemic continues to proliferate, causing us to reevaluate our release dates.”</p>
<p>Another planned late-summer Warner Bros. release, “The Conjuring 3,” will move to next June, the studio announced</p>
<p>The moves do not alter the long-term calendar. “Wonder Woman 1984” remains on schedule for Oct. 2, and “Dune,"a splashy new take on the science-fiction novel, is on track for a Dec. 18 release. Competitor Paramount Pictures plans to release “A Quiet Place Part II” over Labor Day weekend.</p>
<p>But the “Tenet” postponement deals a blow to any hope that one of the country’s premier forms of public entertainment would soon return to anything approaching normal.</p>
<p>Movie theaters have found themselves in a pandemic purgatory - potentially safe enough to plan a reopening, but grouped by many states with bars and restaurants, among the first to close down and the last to reopen. About three-quarters of the country’s 5,000 movie theaters remain closed, even in areas that have been reopening, because studios have not released any new films to make reopening worthwhile yet.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, theater giant AMC, which earlier had said it had enough cash to last into the fall, restructured its debt to give it breathing room into 2021. Still, the move will add to an already highly leveraged balance sheet and does little to address the company’s longer-term ability to pay its creditors.</p>
<p>Other theater owners may need their own forms of creativity.</p>
<p>About 10 days ago, the regional chain Classic Cinemas, which has about 115 screens at 15 locations in Illinois and Wisconsin, closed down after reopening last month. Traffic, the company’s executives said, was just too low amid the lack of new releases and fears about the virus - with receipts at about 10% compared with the same weekends in 2019.</p>
<p>The theaters will stay shuttered until “Tenet” or a comparable big release comes on the calendar. The cost of running the theater for so little revenue does not make it worthwhile, said Chris Johnson, the company’s chief executive.</p>
<p>Johnson said that the firm technically has enough money to make it until the end of the year but that it will require some creativity if Hollywood can’t make good on its promise for fall films.</p>
<p>“I think there’s a way of navigating through, but we’re going to have to pull some creative levers,” he said. And beyond December? “That’s a worst-case scenario.”</p>
<p>The release backstory of “Tenet,” which stars John David Washington as a man trying to prevent a worldwide disaster, has become almost as mind-bending as one of its director’s films. Originally scheduled for July 17, the film held onto that date even as many other films moved, in large part on Nolan’s hopes that the film could reopen movie theaters across the United States. Coronavirus surges across the country forced a push to July 31 and then Aug. 12.</p>
<p>The decision by Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week for all theaters to remain closed indefinitely led to contingency plans. Los Angeles is the second-biggest movie market in the country after New York, with San Francisco also in the top echelon.</p>
<p>John Fithian, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theatre Owners, said studios will have to adopt new and often bolder strategies involving fewer available screens than the usual 3,000 or 4,000.</p>
<p>“Waiting until everything will be open won’t work because what happens if there’s a massive spike somewhere?” he said in an interview. “These things come and go. You have to find a safe way to open a movie during the era of a pandemic.”</p>
<p>He said that by the group’s calculation, 43 states will be sufficiently open to accommodate moviegoing by the beginning of August. That should be enough for many studios to feel comfortable going ahead with their release plans in the fourth quarter - a period that also includes “West Side Story,” the Pixar film “Soul,” the Marvel installment “Black Widow” from Disney, the James Bond picture “No Time to Die” from MGM and Universal, and a host of other big-budget releases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the question about the overseas release is a tricky one. Over the past decade, studios have moved more toward globalization, releasing movies in an ever-greater number of countries, usually simultaneously with the U.S. to stave off piracy and plot leaks and to maximize marketing budgets.</p>
<p>The staggered “Tenet” plan is an attempt to roll that back. But there remain many questions over whether the strategy could work in normal times, let alone during a pandemic. That Warner Bros. will almost certainly have to further bisect the United States itself by region with lower and higher outbreaks only adds to the uncertainty.</p>
<p>“Tenet” faces an addition hurdle in China, the world’s second-largest movie market, where many theaters will reopen this week. But the government is requiring that movies run no longer than two hours, to limit social interactions. “Tenet” clocks in at about 2 hours 30 minutes.</p>
<p>It is not expected that “Tenet,” which cost about $200 million to produce, will start with an online release in the United States, despite fan demand. Such a move, even at a high rental price, would limit the film’s economic upside and would be rejected by Nolan, one of the theatrical experience’s most fervent advocates.</p>
<p>There is little chance that collecting 80% of a $20 or $30 digital rental, as a studio does, can rival box office numbers that in 2019 reached $42.5 billion worldwide and $11.4 billion in the United States. Warner Bros. would rather collect half of a $1 billion gross worldwide even if it means waiting months or longer.</p>
<p>Theater owners do not have that luxury, say owners. On entrepreneur, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive financial information, said banks probably will apply more pressure to theaters, potentially causing closures.</p>
<p>“There was hope we could open and start generating revenue. Now these guys have to start pushing,” the owner said.</p>
<p>Fithian noted that such pressure was building. “Every month a theater stays closed adds to the strain,” he said.</p>
