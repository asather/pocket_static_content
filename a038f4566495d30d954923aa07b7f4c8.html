<h1>Checkout scanners, self-ordering kiosks part of new speed game at PPG Paints Arena</h1>

<p>The Pittsburgh Penguins are always looking to get faster on the ice. Now, they are trying to do the same in the stands and concourses at PPG Paints Arena — in an effort to combat COVID-19 and to speed up concession waits for fans.</p>
<p>Team officials are partnering with concessionaire Aramark to introduce self-checkout scanners, self-ordering kiosks, mobile ordering and touch screen technology at the venue.</p>
<p>“Now, more than ever, it’s imperative we provide a safe and enjoyable environment for everyone we serve,” Mike McDonald, district manager, Aramark’s sports &amp; entertainment division, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The improvements are being made even though the start of the next National Hockey League season is still very much up in the air and there are no guarantees fans will be able to attend games because of COVID-related restrictions on large gatherings.</p>
<p>Among the new technologies, self-checkout scanners utilizing state-of-the-art Mashgin artificial intelligence are being set up throughout the arena. Fans simply can place the items they are buying on the unit for scanning and quick payment.</p>
<p>In addition, self-ordering kiosks will be installed at some locations where fans can customize and pay for their orders.</p>
<p>Fans will be able to place an order from their seats and retrieve it at designated stands by using mobile ordering available through the Penguins mobile app.</p>
<p>A week after announcing they would be teaming with Rivers Casino to build a sportsbook-style bar and betting lounge at PPG Paints Arena, the Penguins are advancing some new concession-related concepts.</p>
<p>They include The King Penguin, a sports bar on the main concourse featuring big screen TVs and a bar; Market in section 116, providing three food stations and grab-and-go food and beverage; and Fan Favs Express in section 119, offering popular food items like hot dogs, popcorn, nachos and beverages combined with self-checkout scanners.</p>
<p>Drink MKT in sections 101, 105, 109, 204, and 215 will feature a self-serve beverage market for premium and craft beer, spiked seltzers, canned cocktails and wine as well as grab-and-go snacks.</p>
<p>Finally, Connected Concepts in section 205 will provide a one-stop shop to grab some of the most popular items around the arena at one location.</p>
<p>Kevin Acklin, the Penguins senior vice president, said the team and Aramark are paying for the improvements.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh-Allegheny County Sports &amp; Exhibition Authority — owner of the arena, Heinz Field, PNC Park and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center — has applied for about $15.2 million in federal and state funding to help try to virus-proof all the venues.</p>
<p>Possible improvements include renovations to high-touch public areas, the reconstruction of food service and retail areas, upgrades to air filtration systems to block the spread of the virus and other safety measures.</p>
<p>“The Penguins and Aramark are bearing the costs of these initial improvements,” Mr. Ackin said of the renovations announced Wednesday. “There are substantial additional arena improvements relating to providing a safe post-COVID environment, which are part of the SEA application for funding.”</p>
