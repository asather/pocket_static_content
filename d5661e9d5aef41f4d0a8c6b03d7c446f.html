<h1>Wolf's budget proposal seeks increased public school funding, charter school law reform </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf’s 2021 budget proposal released Tuesday calls for more than $400 million in funding for public schools and pressured state legislature to seek comprehensive charter school law reform.</p>
<p>It also includes a plan to remove asbestos, lead and mold from public schools and raise the minimum wage for educators from $18,500 to $45,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf proposed $100 million for basic education and $25 million for special education funding.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania State Education Association said it commended the governor’s investment in public education and the “significant step in the right direction” on charter school reform.</p>
<p>“Gov. Wolf’s budget plan continues to make public education a top priority,” Rich Askey, PSEA president, said in a statement. “There is nothing more important than investing in public schools and the students who learn there. Gov. Wolf has been a leader on these issues, and PSEA looks forward to partnering with him and lawmakers to ensure our students are successful.”</p>
<p>The governor’s office said that the charter school law reform proposed in the budget would make another $280 million available for school districts.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Republican-majority state legislature has shut down charter school law reform when it has been brought up in recent years.</p>
<p>The National Coalition for Public School Options, a pro-charter school group, said that the charter school reforms proposed by Mr. Wolf show that the governor is “out of touch” with parents across Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“The governor was fortunate to have the resources to attend the schools of his choice, but his proposals would deny countless Pennsylvania families whose children are trapped in failing school districts their own options,” the coalition said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania School Boards Association raised concerns about teacher salary increases.</p>
<p>A statewide increase, the association said, could result in pay compression, leading to increased salary costs for all teachers. That increase would not only be felt by the schools in increased salary costs, but also in increased pension and charter school tuition costs, according to the association.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The association, however, applauded the governor’s&nbsp;initiative to assist school districts with their response to lead and asbestos in schools.</p>
<p>“Schools have been struggling with maintenance and facility upgrades for years, leading to the current crisis we find ourselves in,” PSBA CEO&nbsp;Nathan Mains said in a statement. “PSBA is encouraged that the Governor and many legislators are focusing on this issue. This effort must be a priority as we move forward – our students and families are counting on us to address this crisis.”</p>
