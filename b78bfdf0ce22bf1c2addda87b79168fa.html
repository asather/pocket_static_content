<h1>Morgantown trust donates $1.3 million in protective equipment to West Virginia hospitals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A charitable trust has purchased $1.3 million worth of personal protective gear, including hundreds of thousands of face masks, for several West Virginia hospitals and first responders.</p>
<p>The Hazel Ruby McQuain Charitable Trust of Morgantown bought the equipment for West Virginia University Medicine hospitals, Wheeling Hospital, Weirton Medical Center and others. The donation comes at a critical time: West Virginia hospitals have been staggered by providing nearly $1 billion in unreimbursed care to victims of the opioid crisis during the last five years and hospital admissions that more recently have fallen between 35% and 50% as the result of a ban on nonemergent medical procedures due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>“This is an incredibly kind and generous donation and the timing of it could not be better,” Albert L. Wright, West Virginia University Health System president and CEO Albert L. Wright said in a prepared statement. “This gift will save lives.”</p>
<p>West Virginia University Health System operates under the brand name of WVU Medicine.</p>
<p>WVU Medicine had contacted the Federal Emergency Management Agency and various state and federal government officials to try to get the protective equipment without luck, Mr. Wright said. WVU Medicine then registered as an importer with the Food &amp; Drug Administration to contract directly with suppliers in China and Vietnam through the hospital’s group purchasing organization.</p>
<p>“We were exhausting all of our resources internally,” Mr. Wright said.&nbsp;“We had all kinds of conversations with FEMA and the state and federal government. They were helpful, but they couldn’t provide the level or the amount of equipment we needed.”</p>
<p>Included in the purchase were 1.1 million procedural masks, 163,025 surgical masks, and 116,120 N-95 respirators. Other recipients included the Mountain State Health System, Thomas Health System and Minnie Hamilton Health System.</p>
