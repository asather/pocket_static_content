<h1>Riverhounds know importance of each match during shortened season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Riverhounds SC hadn’t lost a regular-season match at Highmark Stadium since July 21, 2018 — that is, until Indy Eleven forward Tyler Pasher blew through the back line in stoppage time on Wednesday, delivering a blast that sealed a 1-0 victory for Indy.</p>
<p>“It was tough for us to sleep at night,” Riverhounds defender Jordan Dover said Friday. “Right now it feels like that loss is lingering, so we just want to get onto the next one and get back in the win column.”</p>
<p>Another thing the Riverhounds haven’t done since 2018? Lose twice in a row. Their chance for redemption comes Sunday on the road against the New York Red Bulls II.</p>
<p>The Red Bulls are 1-2 so far in the young USL Championship season but are coming off a 5-1 victory over the Philadelphia Union II. Although New York was shut out in both of its losses, the Riverhounds won’t be complacent. They’re aware of how explosive the Red Bulls can be offensively.</p>
<p>“When they get into the attack, they always throw a lot of numbers forward and they can turn a game on its head like that,” Dover said.</p>
<p>The Riverhounds’ back line appears to be up for the challenge. Dover and fellow defenders Ryan James, Skylar Thomas and Thomas Vancaeyezeele have put together a solid campaign thus far, conceding only two goals through three matches.</p>
<p>Even with a strong defensive effort,&nbsp;it will be important for the Riverhounds’ attack to match the Red Bulls’ intensity.</p>
<p>Following the loss to Indy, coach Bob Lilley said he wants to get Dover and James more involved offensively. That means the team must complete the easy passes and maintain possession so the outside backs feel comfortable playing higher.</p>
<p>“[There were many] times we had simpler options and we gave the ball away,” Lilley said. “You’re not going to tire them out or create chances with one hero ball.”</p>
<p>The Riverhounds are at nearly full strength heading into the weekend. Every man on the roster is available, and forward Steevan Dos-Santos, who had groin surgery during the four-month break from play, is starting to receive more minutes as he returns to playing shape.</p>
<p>A victory Sunday is much-needed, even this early in the season. With only 16 games on the schedule as opposed to the usual 34, each tally in the win column is that much more crucial, and 3-1 looks much different from 2-2.</p>
<p>“New York will try to get a win on their home field and put us at two losses and open the door for everyone,” Lilley said. “Regardless of what their record says now, I know their personnel, and they’ll be a good team.”</p>
