<h1>Ron Cook: Penguins appear to be overconfident with a fully healthy squad</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An early 3-0 hole that felt like it was the size of a canyon. A wasted 5-on-3 power-play opportunity for 1:25 that produced just one shot. A total of 13 shots on goal through two periods. A failed penalty shot by Jared McCann, who hasn’t scored a goal in 20 games since Jan. 14. A combined minus-7 by the top defensive pairing, Kris Letang and Brian Dumoulin. One odd-man break after another that contributed significantly to five, much-too-easy goals against, including one short-handed.</p>
<p>It’s baffling how the Penguins could play so poorly in a big game against their biggest rival with plenty at stake.</p>
<p>The 5-2 home loss to the Washington Capitals Saturday afternoon was nothing short of an embarrassment.</p>
<p>Give Evgeni Malkin credit, hard as that might seem to do on a day when he was a minus-3. At least he tried to explain the Penguins’ inexcusable no-show.</p>
<p>“When we have five or six guys injured, we play so much better. Everybody steps up. It’s like we understand we have to play better,” Malkin said.</p>
<p>“Now, everyone is back. Everyone is healthy. [Dumoulin] is back. [John] Marino is back. We think we have so much skill right now. Every game, like we [are going] to score every shift. No …</p>
<p>“We try to play easy. It’s not our game. It’s a little bit hard to understand right now.”</p>
<p>Malkin might be on to something.</p>
<p>The Penguins went 7-4 when Malkin missed 11 games in October.</p>
<p>They went 18-6-4 when Sidney Crosby missed 28 games between mid-November and mid-January.</p>
<p>They hung in despite the lengthy losses of Dumoulin, Marino, Letang, Justin Schultz and, most hurtful, 40-goal man Jake Guentzel on Dec. 30.</p>
<p>They didn’t just hang in, they excelled enough by playing a conscientious 200-foot game and getting strong goaltending to take over first place in the Metropolitan Division on Feb. 18.</p>
<p>But the Penguins went through a six-game losing streak immediately after that. They won games against a bad Ottawa team and a bad Buffalo club despite playing less than their best. Then, there was that hideous loss Saturday, which left them five points behind Washington in the division standings and three behind Philadelphia before the Flyers played Saturday night.</p>
<p>“I think we just kind of chased a mistake with another one,” Crosby said of the Capitals scoring three first-period goals, including the first by Nic Dowd just 1:52 in. “It’s very similar to the playoffs. One little mistake and it’s in the back of your net. We’ve got to understand that.”</p>
<p>Matt Murray, getting a third consecutive start, never had a chance against the Capitals, who had numbers on each of their five goals. That doesn’t all fall on Malkin or Dumoulin (minus-3) and Letang (minus-4). But the mistakes have to be corrected soon, preferably before the Penguins line up at 1:30 Sunday afternoon against Carolina on the PPG Paints Arena ice. That game will be the second of 10 consecutive games against Metropolitan Division opponents for the Penguins. In fact, they will play 14 of their 15 remaining games against division teams. If you look at the standings, you know there will be no easy ones.</p>
<p>“I’ve said all along the challenge is, as we get healthy, that we maintain a clear understanding of how we had success and the identity that we’ve built here,” Mike Sullivan said. “It’s rooted in simplicity. It’s rooted in a straight-ahead game where we can leverage our foot speed and give our talent the opportunity to be the difference. I think it’s more about understanding how we have to play in order for us to be our best.</p>
<p>“We’ve got capable people. We’ve got the depth that we need. We’re trying to utilize four lines. It’s more about collective effort, trying to play the right way and paying attention to the details. That’s what it boils down to. We’ve got to make better decisions, both with the puck and without the puck. When we do that and we get locked in, I think that’s when we’re hard to play against and we’re a lot stingier.”</p>
<p>The final words come from Malkin, who knows the Penguins haven’t just dropped into third place in the division but aren’t all that far from sinking out of a playoff slot.</p>
<p>“Now, we’re a healthy team. We have everything to win. We need to start to work.”</p>
