<h1>Chevron to buy Noble Energy for $5 billion in rare oil-bust deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Chevron Corp. agreed to buy Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion in shares as the oil giant looks to beef up in the Permian Basin amid the wreckage of the worst-ever crude crash.</p>
<p>The takeover is the industry’s first major deal since the coronavirus triggered a severe slump and the largest since Occidental Petroleum Corp. outbid Chevron to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp. for $37 billion last year.</p>
<p>Chevron and Noble both had sizable footprints in Marcellus Shale in Appalachia. Noble exited the basin in 2017 after selling its stake in a joint-venture with CNX Resources. Chevron hung on longer, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2019/12/11/Chevron-to-leave-Appalachia-marcellus-shale-oil-and-gas-fracking/stories/201912110131" target="_blank">announcing plans to sell its Appalachian assets in December</a>&nbsp;after the holdings resulted in more than $5 billion in impairment charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Noble deal will grow Chevron’s presence in both the Permian, once the main driver of the shale boom, and the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Colorado. Its proved reserves will rise by about 18%. Buying Noble also enlarges Chevron’s footprint in the Eastern Mediterranean by adding the Leviathan gas field off the coast of Israel.</p>
<p>“These are high-quality assets at a fair price,” Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday. “This isn’t just about the Permian Basin. Noble’s got a very impressive position in the Eastern Mediterranean, West Africa, a nice position in Colorado.”</p>
<p>Noble was up 5.8% to $10.21 at 11:37 a.m. in New York. Chevron dropped 1.3% to $86.06.</p>
<p>Consolidation in the shale patch has been largely non-existent this year as the combination of a severe oil-price slump and pressure on companies from investors to return cash leaves explorers with little firepower to make deals. Globally, energy mergers and acquisitions total about $132 billion so far this year, including the Chevron deal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down by almost 60% year on year.</p>
<p>“Chevron’s acquisition of Noble Energy comes early in the crude price and credit-tightening cycles, which makes its returns on capital reliant on a recovery in U.S. oil prices and, consequently, slower growth from peers,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Fernando Valle said.</p>
<p>On a conference call to discuss the takeover, Noble CEO Dave Stover was quizzed by analysts over why he accepted Chevron’s offer, given just five months earlier his company had a market value of nearly $9 billion, 80% higher than what the supermajor agreed to pay.</p>
<p>“The way we looked at it is, in a stock-for-stock transaction, it maintains the upside exposure and minimizes the downside risk,” he said. “Scale really matters here.”</p>
<p>Analysts at RBC Capital Markets were unimpressed. “Our conversations with investors indicate that most see the acquisition premium as a bit low and are left wondering why the board of directors sold at that valuation,” RBC analyst Scott Hanold wrote in a note.</p>
<p>Chevron has shown interest in buying up distressed shale producers before. Mr. Wirth said it was the unique combination of Noble’s nearby, high-quality Permian assets, the huge Israeli gas operation as well as the DJ Basin that got the deal done.</p>
<p>“We get asked a lot about pure-play Permian,” Mr. Wirth said on the call. “We’re already big in the Permian. Getting bigger isn’t necessarily the goal; getting better certainly is important.”</p>
<p>Last year, Chevron lost the takeover battle for Anadarko but ultimately walked away the victor with a $1 billion break-up fee as oil prices plunged. Occidental won with a higher bid, but has subsequently struggled with the large debt pile resulting from that deal. Its shares are down about 75% since the Anadarko saga began.</p>
<p>After Anadarko, Noble was among the top four potential candidates that Chevron could have gone after as it closely resembled Anadarko’s portfolio at a smaller scale, Bob Brackett, an analyst at Bernstein, said Monday in a note to investors.</p>
<p>“We still don’t embrace the Permian M&amp;A theme as a money maker,” Mr. Brackett wrote.</p>
