<h1>Pelosi says negotiators 'close to an agreement' on coronavirus relief, hopes for vote Friday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Top negotiators were unable to clinch a final agreement on a sweeping legislative package to address the economic fallout of the escalating coronavirus crisis Thursday night, pushing talks into Friday as they sought to close out a handful of outstanding issues.</p>
<p>After hours of talks and trading of proposals, including eight separate phone calls over the course of the day between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, President Donald Trump's point person on the talks, negotiators are still attempting to iron out differences on specific language over a package that is expected to include paid leave, expanded food assistance, extended unemployment insurance and free coverage for coronavirus testing.</p>
<p>"It's fair to say we're close to an agreement, subject to the exchange of paper, and hope to have an agreement tomorrow," Ms. Pelosi told reporters outside of her office Thursday evening. "We've resolved most of our differences and those we haven't, we'll continue the conversation because there will be other bills."</p>
<p>Asked if she was confident that there would be a vote on a deal on Friday, Ms. Pelosi responded: "One way or another."</p>
<p>The speed by which Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin are working won't be matched by the Senate, however. The chamber has left town for the week, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced earlier in the day the next week's scheduled recess has been canceled so the Senate can take up any agreement reached by Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin.</p>
<p>One of the primary hurdles to a final deal has been a Democratic provision to implement paid leave. Republicans have said such a provision would create a federal mandate by requiring employers to let workers accrue an extra seven days of leave on top of 14 days of immediate paid time off in the event of "any public health emergency" — something the business community, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has voiced significant opposition to on account of the potential cost burden it would apply to small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>Negotiators have agreed to narrow the scope of the mandate, while agreeing to offset the cost for small- and medium-sized businesses through a tax credit. Negotiations have also included whether to include funding for Small Business Administration loans that are a priority for Mr. Trump, though a final agreement on that piece has not yet been reached.</p>
<p>Key elements from the original Democratic proposal, which was released publicly Wednesday night, are expected to be maintained, including expanded food assistance, extended unemployment insurance and free coverage for coronavirus testing. The details of how those would be implemented in a final deal were still being hammered out Thursday evening.<em style="font-size: 1.17em;"><br></em></p>
