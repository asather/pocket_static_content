<h1>Belle Vernon Area teachers issue strike notice to school district</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The union that represents teachers and other staff in Belle Vernon Area schools announced it will go on strike next week unless a contract can be reached with the district.</p>
<p>The Belle Vernon Area Education Association, which represents 161 teachers, nurses, counselors and education specialists, issued a strike notice to the district and school board on Monday indicating that a work stoppage would begin March 13.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until then, the union will perform under a “work to rule” designation, meaning that teachers will not perform duties outside of their contractual obligations, such as sponsoring clubs and after-school tutoring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The union and the Belle Vernon Area School District have been negotiating a contract since January 2019. Teachers have been working without a contract since June 30.</p>
<p>In a statement, BVAEA President Daneen Watson expressed frustration with the school board after it canceled a negotiation session last Wednesday in which the union was hoping to reach a tentative contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When our members learned that the board had cancelled the session, they had a lot to say and, in a word, they saw this antic as another piece of&nbsp;‘gamesmanship’ from a board that they don’t believe is sincere in seeking a settlement,” Ms. Watson said.&nbsp;“Our team has worked hard to find a resolution. We have made significant concessions in a number of areas and have met the board in issues that were important to them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ira Weiss, solicitor for the school district, said in a statement that the&nbsp;“unfortunate and ill-advised” decision to strike would harm students and families.</p>
<p>“The district and the association have been involved in bargaining over a new labor&nbsp;contract for more than one year. Unfortunately, those negotiations have not resulted in a&nbsp;new contract and right now both sides have firmly held positions,” Mr. Weiss said. “The district faces very&nbsp;tough financial challenges and is attempting to address many issues in the current&nbsp;proposal with the goal to ensure that the district lives within its means and operates&nbsp;within current — and future —&nbsp;financial realities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The actions by the association immediately means drastically limited activities for our&nbsp;students and disruptions in the daily enrichment activities in our schools,” his statement continued. “It is&nbsp;unfortunate the association has placed the adult issues in negotiations ahead of the&nbsp;welfare and best interests of students and families.”</p>
<p>Mr. Weiss said the district was prepared to meet with the union at the direction of a state mediator in an effort to avoid the work stoppage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Watson said that the union was willing to negotiate as often as necessary to resolve the contract issue.</p>
<p>“Negotiations are a difficult process which require hard work and good faith from both parties,” she said.&nbsp;“But at a point where most parties would be working hard to find a way to succeed on a resolution, the board’s team seems to be searching for ways to prevent a resolution. Our members have made it clear: playing games will have consequences. Our team will show up when directed or asked ready to work hard. We hope the board’s team shares that mentality.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Belle Vernon Area School District spans 42.2 square miles in Westmoreland and Fayette counties about 25 miles southeast of Pittsburgh and has an enrollment of more than 2,500 students.</p>
