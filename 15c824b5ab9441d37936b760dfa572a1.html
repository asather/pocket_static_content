<h1>Police charge man, 19, with shooting into Mount Oliver house</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police arrested a Mount Oliver man believed to have shot into a house last month during an exchange of gunfire.</p>
<p>Kyreese Thomas, 19, is charged with discharging a firearm into an occupied structure and a drug offense.</p>
<p>Allegheny County police apprehended Mr. Thomas at his home Tuesday. They searched his house and said they found two handguns — one of them reported stolen —&nbsp;and heroin.</p>
<p>Police said they linked Mr. Thomas to a Feb. 26 incident in which shots were fired in the 100 block of Ormsby Avenue around 12:02 p.m. and a house was struck</p>
<p>Officers found three different calibers of spent casings at the scene.</p>
<p>In a news release, police said that while no victims were found on Ormsby, they learned that a short time later, a person went to UPMC Mercy with a gunshot wound.</p>
<p>That person was treated and released.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if the injured person was shot during the incident on Ormsby Avenue. County police Lt. Michael O’Keefe declined to provide more detail, saying only that the shooting remained under investigation and detectives continue to analyze evidence.</p>
<p>Detectives developed two possible suspects and looked at surveillance video of part of the incident.</p>
<p>Anyone with information can call&nbsp;the Allegheny County Police Tipline at 1-833-ALL-TIPS (1-833-255-8477).</p>
