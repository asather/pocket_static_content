<h1>Western Pa. reports 4 new deaths, all in Allegheny County</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There were four new deaths reported in Western Pennsylvania on Tuesday. All were in Allegheny County and three occurred in a nursing or long-term care home, according to the latest data released by the state health department.</p>
<p>The three nursing home deaths likely represent the three fatalities reported Monday by the county at the Kane Community Living Centers’ Glen Hazel facility. The center’s death toll had jumped by three (to 16 total) from its previously reported total of 13 on Friday. Countywide, the virus has impacted 36 facilities, with 368 cases being reported among residents and 104 cases being reported among employees. According to the state, 97 people have died at nursing homes or long-term care homes in Allegheny.</p>
<p>With the new figures, Allegheny has a total of 1,526 cases — 1,451 confirmed and 75&nbsp;probable — of COVID-19 since the first case was reported March 14.</p>
<p>A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to the county. Dr. Levine said that positive antibody tests are being counted as probable cases in the state’s figures as well.</p>
<p>There are now 127 deaths attributed to COVID-19 in Allegheny County — 117 confirmed and 10 probable. At least 94 of those deaths have occurred at nursing or long-term care homes. On Monday, the&nbsp;reported separately that three more deaths had occurred at Kane Community Living Centers’ Glen Hazel facility, bringing its total to 16.&nbsp;The total is an update from the 13 the facility reported Friday.</p>
<p>The county said 280 people, past or present, have required hospitalization. There have been 117 people admitted to an intensive care unit, and 667 of them have required mechanical ventilation. So far, there have been 21,488 tests administered.</p>

<p>Also on Monday, the state reported 837 new cases of COVID-19 and 75 deaths related to the disease.</p>
<p>The state has had 57,991 cases and 3,806 deaths from the virus. Philadelphia continues to have the highest totals in the state, with 15,218 cases and 871 deaths.</p>
<p>On Monday, Dr. Levine said data for individual nursing homes may be released as early as this week. In response to a question about a recent order from New York governor Andrew Cuomo to test all nursing home staff twice a week for COVID-19, Dr. Levine said that a similar order is under consideration and may also be released this week.</p>
<p>Additionally, as more counties and regions progress to the “yellow” phase of reopening — large swaths of northeast and north-central Pennsylvania opened on Friday, and much of the southwest will open on May 15 — Dr. Levine indicated a focus on the expansion of testing. She highlighted RiteAid, which is now providing free testing to anybody, regardless of symptoms, at 15 locations across Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“Getting tested helps us identify outbreaks, so it is essential that we have accessible and available testing sites in communities across Pennsylvania,” Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>Most of the RiteAid sites are in the southeast region, which continues to see the highest case growth. In Western Pennsylvania there is one each in Monroeville and Erie.</p>
