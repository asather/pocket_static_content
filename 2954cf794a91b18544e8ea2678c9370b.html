<h1>Taking stock of the Penguins' prospects after the Jason Zucker trade</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins, looking to solidify themselves as Stanley Cup contenders here and now, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/10/pittsburgh-penguins-trade-minnesota-wild-alex-galchenyuk-jason-zucker/stories/202002100139" target="_blank">got their man Monday in Jason Zucker</a>, a solid two-way winger with wheels, a good shot and a chance at his fifth 20-goal season in six years.</p>
<p>To acquire Zucker from the Minnesota Wild, they sacrificed two of their top five future assets in blue-line prospect Calen Addison and a first-round pick.</p>
<p>Some talking heads questioned whether general manager Jim Rutherford gave up too much to get Zucker. Chris Peters, an NHL draft and prospect analyst for ESPN, was not among them. He believes it was “a good trade for both sides.”</p>
<p>Peters feels Zucker will be a good fit and pointed to the fact that he is under contract at a reasonable salary through 2022-23 to argue that Zucker was worth the Penguins giving up multiple assets. He would not have felt the same way had they done that for a rental such as Chris Kreider of the New York Rangers.</p>
<p>“When you get a guy who has a 30-goal season in his back pocket with term on his contract, that’s the kind of move a win-now team should be making,” Peters said Wednesday. “And the Penguins are in their perpetual win-now mode.”</p>
<p>While it’s tough to question Rutherford’s desire to do whatever it takes to win as many Cups as possible while Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin are still in their prime, one can also acknowledge it will cost the Penguins down the road.</p>
<p>They already had one of the NHL’s shallowest prospect pools prior to the trade. They are low on assets if they want to add another forward or make a move to help out their banged-up blue-line corps before the Feb. 24 trade deadline.</p>
<p>Peters was among the many who felt Addison, an offensive-minded defenseman currently playing in the Western Hockey League, was their top prospect.</p>
<p>Addison did not make Peters’ list of the top 100 NHL prospects last summer. But Peters said he has risen these past few months with a strong showing for Canada in the World Junior Championships and improved decision-making and defense at the WHL level, though he said Addison still has a ways to go.</p>
<p>“He is a guy who has a chance to be a pretty good offensive defenseman in the NHL,” Peters said. “He still has some development time ahead of him. I don’t think he’ll play in the NHL next season. But he’s a guy that I think has NHL skill. So that’s a tough loss, but it’s one you don’t necessarily mind too much.”</p>
<p>With Addison gone, Peters says Samuel Poulin is now Pittsburgh’s top prospect.</p>
<p>The Penguins got the 18-year-old with the 21st overall pick last summer. At that time, Peters pegged Poulin as a second-rounder, questioning his hockey IQ and motor. In 39 games this season, the 6-foot-2 winger has put up 30 goals and 38 assists for Sherbrooke of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.</p>
<p>“He’s had a really strong season,” Peters said. “I saw him earlier in the year at the [CHL Canada-Russia Series]. Some of the things that I didn’t love about his game were still evident there. But you look at the production, and he’s an offensive leader. He definitely has skill. I think I underrated his skill last year.”</p>
<p>Right behind Poulin are, in order, forwards Nathan Legare and Filip Hallander.</p>
<p>Peters raved about Legare’s “elite” release and his ability to fire pucks through traffic. The 19-year-old winger has 82 goals in 178 career QMJHL games. His skating remains a question mark. Hallander is a “highly skilled, creative player” who has missed most of his Swedish Hockey League season due to injury.</p>
<p>Peters mentioned Sam Miletic, Jordy Bellerive, Valtteri Puustinen and Justin Almeida as prospects with a chance to become NHLers. The problem is they’re all forwards.</p>
<p>He is not thrilled about any of the Penguins’ blue-line prospects. He “has never been a huge fan of Pierre-Olivier Joseph” and isn’t sure about his future.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to say that the Penguins have nothing,” Peters said. “Because those first three guys are players that I am pretty fond of and I think that all three can be impact prospects down the line depending on how they pan out.”</p>
<p>He also noted that the Penguins have a strong track record of finding gems in the later rounds of the NHL draft and slowly polishing them over time. Look no further than Cup winners Jake Guentzel, Bryan Rust and Matt Murray.</p>
<p>Peters said trading away another first-round pick, like giving up Addison, does sting a bit. But he didn’t think it is a “huge loss” for the Penguins either.</p>
<p>Barring a late-season collapse that keeps them out of the playoffs, the Penguins will send the Wild this year’s first-round pick. It’s a star-studded class led by Alexis Lafreniere. But Peters said it’s not as deep as last year, when he felt there were quality prospects still on the board between picks 20 and 50.</p>
<p>“It’s still early. A lot can happen and opinions can change. But my sense is that if you’re not in the lottery, you’re not getting a high-end prospect,” he said.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh doesn’t have a second-round pick in 2020. It was traded to Vegas to ensure that Vegas claimed Marc-Andre Fleury in the 2017 expansion draft.</p>
<p>These win-now moves might leave little behind whenever Crosby and Malkin hang up their skates. But that’s the price the Penguins are understandably willing to pay to win another Stanley Cup. Going forward, those two superstars may not get a better chance than the one staring them in the face.</p>
<p>“They’ve only had two first-round picks in the last eight drafts including 2020, so it’s really hard to build a [deep prospect pool],” Peters said. “But, at the same time, how many teams have two of the best players in the world?”</p>
