<h1>Lawyer for Oneil Cruz rips reports linking Pirates prospect and alcohol</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The lawyer for Oneil Cruz argued on social media that his client had not been impaired by alcohol before a fatal car accident Monday that killed three people in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post made Friday but detected Saturday morning, Yajaira Gomez Ortiz criticized “false reports” that said Cruz had alcohol in his system at the time of the early-morning crash.</p>
<p>The translated version of the post basically says that reports of the incident are intentionally trying to harm Cruz and damage his character while also ignoring his mental health; however, there’s a reason why Cruz and alcohol have been linked, and it traces back to the Dominican government.</p>
<p>After Monday’s crash, a press release from the attorney general’s office-Public Ministry said that, “according to investigations, the accused had ingested alcoholic beverages prior to the accident.”</p>
<p>However, during Cruz’s arraignment Friday, the subject of alcohol never came up. The same for a subsequent press release issued by the same office.&nbsp;Also, according to a Pirates source, the organization so far has received no indication that Cruz had been drinking.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette contacted the attorney general’s office on Friday afternoon, seeking an explanation, and a spokeswoman offered two points of clarity.</p>
<p>The first involved how and why Cruz was accused of drinking, as the spokeswoman said that Cruz “smelled of alcohol.” But she also said that no sobriety tests were ever performed due to a “procedural error.”</p>
<p>As part of his Facebook post, Cruz’s lawyer provided a document from the Public Ministry that includes no mention of alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Gomez Ortiz also said reports of the accident omitted an important detail — that the motorcycle carrying three people had no lights. The Post-Gazette, in all of its coverage of the Cruz case, has written that the motorcycle did not have lights.</p>
<p>The crash occurred early in the morning, after a COVID-19-related curfew had been put in place. Cruz was driving a white Jeep on Sanchez Highway between Bani and San Cristóbal. Both vehicles were traveling in the left lane when the Jeep struck the motorcycle, killing three people ages 19, 20 and 23.</p>
<p>Gomez Ortiz, in his post, praised Cruz for calling 911 after the crash.</p>
<p>The initial investigation was handled by the General Directorate of Traffic Safety and Land Transportation, which is known in the Dominican Republic as DIGESETT.</p>
<p>That group did not perform a Breathalyzer test, a DIGESETT spokesman confirmed. He further explained that, after the traffic end of the crash was investigated, Cruz was detained and "handed over to the Public Ministry, the body in charge of continuing the corresponding investigations and legal actions."</p>
<p>According to the Public Ministry's release on Friday, Cruz is not jailed but must check in with authorities periodically as a condition of bail. There's also no known court date at this time.</p>
<p>Cruz has been with the Pirates since 2017, after he was acquired in a trade with the Dodgers for reliever Tony Watson. He’s considered their third-best prospect by MLB Pipeline and the 60th-best in Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-7 shortstop spent the 2020 season at the Pirates' alternate training site in Altoona. However, when that group disbanded last week, Cruz was sent back to the Dominican Republic instead of the Pirates bringing him to Pittsburgh.</p>
