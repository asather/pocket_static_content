<h1>Prospect Ke’Bryan Hayes also missing from Pirates workouts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Add third-base prospect Ke’Bryan Hayes to the list of Pirates players who have not yet participated in summer camp.</p>
<p>Speaking on a Zoom call Thursday night, manager Derek Shelton confirmed that Hayes has not been on the field at PNC Park, although he did not elaborate.</p>
<p>When asked on Wednesday, Shelton said closer Keone Kela <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/08/Derek-Shelton-Keone-Kela-work-out-Pirates-Hector-Noesi-Kyle-Crick/stories/202007080170" target="_blank">had also not yet practiced</a> with the team. No reason was given for either absence, and Shelton said Thursday that “we won’t do a daily update on who is and who isn’t [practicing]. When we adjust that, we’ll let you know.”</p>
<p>Hayes’ absence became especially noticeable on Thursday, when the Pirates appeared to go through infield drills with at least the top two players at each position.</p>
<p>Colin Moran and Philip Evans took the reps at third. Josh Bell and Jose Osuna were at first. Adam Frazier was at second base, Kevin Newman played shortstop and Cole Tucker, JT Riddle and Erik Gonzalez rotated in behind them.</p>
<p>Hayes is a slick-fielding prospect who’s won three consecutive Gold Gloves in the minor leagues. There was an outside chance he could compete for a starting spot, although the Pirates to this point have shown little interest in using Hayes, 23, in the major leagues.</p>
<p>This current delay — no matter the cause — almost assuredly means Moran will be the Pirates’ opening day third baseman.</p>
<p><strong>’Twas raining then</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates tried to play an intrasquad game on Thursday, but a couple serious storms forced the first rainout of the season.</p>
<p>First opening day 1.0 for Shelton. Now, this.</p>
<p>“I can’t even get an intrasquad game in,” Shelton joked.</p>
<p>Trevor Williams was supposed to start for one of the teams but was pushed back to Friday, which Shelton explained was Williams’ choice.</p>
<p><strong>Strat-a-matic</strong></p>
<p>Steven Brault and Chad Kuhl might not be the only starting pitchers the Pirates use in a piggyback role.</p>
<p>Shelton said that Chris Stratton, who has started 41 games in his career, could also fall into that category.</p>
<p>The Pirates acquired Stratton from the Angels for cash on May 11, 2019, and he seemed to find a home here in a long relief role.</p>
<p>That seemingly could continue — with Stratton looking to go three-four innings — or the right-hander could function as the first part of a piggyback.</p>
<p>“We’re going to get creative with that spot,” Shelton said, repeating a phrase he’s used often in the past couple weeks. “He’s a guy that could jump into it with some other guys.”</p>
<p><strong>Ears out</strong></p>
<p>Appropriate in the COVID-19 era, third-base coach Joey Cora may have to adjust his signs to ensure he doesn’t repeatedly touch his face.</p>
<p>Shelton said Cora has been wearing a face shield and joked that “he’s going to perform some surgeries at some point.”</p>
<p>The Pirates are following protocols and asking everyone to wash their hands when they come off the field, though developing a new sign system would be a fairly significant step.</p>
<p>“I may adjust our signs a little bit to stay away from the face,” Shelton said. “I’m not going to tell you what our signs are for two reasons. We have not decided what they are — probably the biggest one — and I just don’t want you to know.”</p>
