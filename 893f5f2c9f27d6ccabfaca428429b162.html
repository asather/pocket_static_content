<h1>National briefs: Trump OKs role to fight trafficking; Accuser says Weinstein raped her twice; Conn. woman sets off chase near Mar-a-Lago</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday creating a position within his domestic policy team dedicated solely to fighting human trafficking. The order, signed during a White House summit on the issue, also proposes an additional $42 million in funding for service programs and prosecutions.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump was joined by Vice President Mike Pence and first daughter Ivanka Trump. Ms. Trump’s office organized the summit to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which established trafficking as a federal crime.</p>
<p>Some anti-trafficking organizations decided to boycott the event, citing the administration’s treatment of trafficking victims who are immigrants. Among them was Polaris, the organization that runs the national human trafficking hotline.</p>
<p>“Nobody has done more than what we have been doing on human trafficking,” Mr. Trump claimed.</p>
<p>Statistics from the Department of Justice show otherwise. Prosecutions of sex and labor traffickers, which fluctuated during the Obama era, are down from 531 in fiscal year 2016 to 343 in fiscal year 2019.</p>
<p>The proposal in Mr. Trump’s executive order would increase the budget for those investigations and prosecutions by $4 million.</p>
<p><strong>Accuser says Weinstein raped her twice</strong></p>
<p>A key accuser in Harvey Weinstein’s trial testified Friday that he raped her twice, once bellowing, “You owe me!” as he dragged her into a bedroom.</p>
<p>The first time, the heavyset Hollywood tycoon trapped her in a New York hotel room in March 2013, angrily ordered her to undress as he loomed over her, then raped her, she told jurors.</p>
<p>Then, eight months later, he screamed “You owe me one more time!” she told jurors. She said she begged him not to take off her clothes, but he said, “I don’t have time for games” and raped her.</p>
<p>The once-powerful film producer, 67, is charged in New York with the March 2013 rape and also sexually assaulting Mimi Haleyi, a former “Project Runway” production assistant, in 2006.</p>
<p><strong>Conn. woman sets off chase near Mar-a-Lago</strong></p>
<p>An “impaired” Connecticut woman fleeing from a Florida Highway Patrol trooper breached Secret Service blockades in place to protect President Donald Trump and his Palm Beach estate and — apparently unintentionally — set off a car chase and an officer-involved shooting Friday, officials said.</p>
<p>Hannah Roemhild wasn’t targeting Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said, and no one was hurt.</p>
<p>Security chased Ms. Roemhild in cars and helicopters. Sheriff Bradshaw said officers shot at her car, fearing she was targeting pedestrians or carrying a car bomb.</p>
<p>Ms. Roemhild, 30, an opera singer, faces federal and state charges of assault on an officer and deadly assault on law enforcement.</p>
