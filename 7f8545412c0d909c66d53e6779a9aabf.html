<h1>Chris Archer on his haircut, bouncing back, the Pirates' new vibe and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — The easy story line here would probably be to make Chris Archer lopping off his dreadlocks, as he did last week, about some sort of fresh start, a new beginning, the line of demarcation where the Pirates pitcher can forget the troubles he’s experienced in Pittsburgh thus far.</p>
<p>If we’re being honest, though, that would be a lie.</p>
<p>Archer said he had been kicking around the idea of a haircut, something he had avoided for five years, and he woke up last Thursday a little extra motivated to end his three-year relationship with the dreadlocks. It wasn’t anything existential or trippy. It was simply time for a change.</p>
<p>“I was just over it,” Archer said. “One thing I’ve learned over the years is that you can’t do everything for other people. There are certain things you have to do for yourself. If it was up to other people and other peoples’ opinions about me needing a fresh start, I would have cut [the dreadlocks] a long time ago.”</p>
<p>And now, Archer would explain, he loves it, whether it’s putting his head under the shower and feeling the water hit his scalp or simply running his fingers through his hair. It has, without a doubt, been a welcomed change.</p>
<p>“My head feels so much lighter,” Archer said. “It’s the true definition of light-headed … in a good way.”</p>
<p>But don’t let Archer fool you. He tried his best to tamp down why he cut his hair, saying it was a simple thing, but there's at least something bigger at play here, which Archer later admitted.</p>
<p>Archer’s 2020 season — now all of one day old after most pitchers and catchers arrived at Pirate City on Monday — will be nothing short of huge for the Pirates, who are still chasing the ghost of when they acquired the right-hander for Austin Meadows, Tyler Glasnow and Shane Baz, waiting for their midseason acquisition to truly become what they thought they were getting.</p>
<p>Archer showed signs last season, when he rediscovered a former version of himself, but a late-season shoulder/biceps injury short-circuited that progress. Now, as he made a similar move to that of Andrew McCutchen five years ago, Archer will be looking for a different result.</p>
<p>“It kind of ties into the whole getting back to being yourself,” Archer said. “As long as you’re handling your business, you have to do things your way because when it’s all said and done and you look back at your career, in whatever profession you're in, the mistakes and successes were all me. I didn’t make a mistake because I was trying to do something that wasn’t who I was.”</p>
<p>So, who is Archer, then? For one, he has a history of being a very good strikeout pitcher, someone who has relied a lot on his four-seam fastball and devastating slider to rack up punch outs.</p>
<p>That guy, Archer has insisted, is still there. The slider remains deadly, and the fastball velocity is more than good enough to get outs. The issue, more often than not, has been Archer pretending to be something he’s not.</p>
<p>Too often since the Pirates acquired him — before rebooting in the middle of last season — Archer tinkered with throwing sinkers and pitching to contact instead of attacking hitters with his best weapons.</p>
<p>Once Archer reverted back to his old form, the results started to come.</p>
<p>So far this spring, new pitching coach Oscar Marin has talked to Archer about being more athletic on the mound. There’s obviously a physical aspect to that, but Archer’s interpretation is more mental, for him to think less about what he’s doing and to simply believe in who he is and the weapons that he has.</p>
<p>“A lot of us in here are blessed with natural ability,” Archer said. “When you try to hone it in too much, and you start thinking about where you’re at in space too much, it takes away from why you’re actually here.</p>
<p>"It’s like when you have a sprinter who’s super fast and you try to tweak his form but he loses power and speed. It’s similar to that. When I start thinking about my delivery too much, I’m not as fluid. That takes away from how the ball comes out of my hand.”</p>
<p>Already Archer feels different. Last spring, because of hernia surgery, he had two weeks of strength training. This year, Archer has had 15. He also switched his offseason training, choosing to work with Zach Ray, who’s a trainer/physical therapist based in Westlake Village, Calif.</p>
<p>“The program is very specific,” Archer said. “We were able to set a really solid foundation and build on top of that. I feel really good about where I’m at.”</p>
<p>Where Archer used to be is another part of who he is that warranted discussion Monday, as Archer was asked about the Pirates’ overall expectations while carrying a $48.3 million payroll, the third-lowest in Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>To answer the question, Archer referenced what the Rays did in 2013, how they reached the ALCS despite having the third-lowest payroll in baseball.</p>
<p>“Teams with low payrolls make playoff pushes,” Archer said. “In 2013 we had the lowest attendance in the league, and we had the lowest payroll that made the playoffs. I know it’s possible.”</p>
<p><strong>Don't cheat me</strong></p>
<p>Among the other topics Archer discussed was the Astros' sign-stealing scandal, calling the whole thing "disheartening" but also saying everyone should probably move on.</p>
<p>"You heard some rumors, but I don’t think anyone expected it to be to that extent,” Archer said. “Especially when you know these dudes on a personal level, and to find out I was a part of them being successful, it was definitely disheartening. It’s bad for the game.</p>
<p>"It is what it is at this point. ... At some point we have to let it go because the season’s going to start here in a month and a half.”</p>
<p><strong>Different approach</strong></p>
<p>Although these days are fairly informal, Archer said there's been a different vibe around the Pirates with Derek Shelton in charge as opposed to Clint Hurdle.</p>
<p>The biggest change involves focusing on more baseball-related activities as opposed to "little things off the field, little things that don't matter."</p>
<p>"It’s just more of an open, newer mindset," Archer added. "It’s hard to put into words. It’s more of a vibe. It’s not as hard-nosed. There’s still grit. There’s still intention behind everything we do. But it’s baseball, man. We’re not lining up and trying to knock each other out. It’ll be fun, though. It’ll be fun."</p>
