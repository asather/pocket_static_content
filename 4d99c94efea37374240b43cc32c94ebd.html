<h1>Pirates on pause: Is this catching group good enough to compete?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jacob Stallings deserves ample credit for what he did last season. After the Pirates designated him for assignment in May, Stallings hung around and wound up having a terrific defensive season, the combination of his framing, blocking and throwing among the best in Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>At a position where the Pirates are thin throughout the organization, they’ll need another surprise or two like that in 2020 if they’re going to replicate the playoff success they achieved from 2013-15, when Russell Martin and Francisco Cervelli combined to make catching one of Pittsburgh’s unquestioned strengths.</p>
<p>“I had no intention of being a starting catcher in the major leagues last year,” Stallings said during PiratesFest. “That’s what ended up happening. Anything I can do to help the team win, obviously I would love the opportunity to be a starter. I’ll do whatever I need to do.”</p>
<p>What Stallings and offseason acquisitions Luke Maile and John Ryan Murphy must do is fairly sizable. They must help improve a position group that finished last in MLB in home runs (9, tied) and RBIs (47). Pittsburgh was also 28th in MLB and last in the National League in OPS (.620).</p>
<p>Though Stallings actually had a respectable offensive season, slashing .262/.325/.382 and producing a .708 OPS — Yadier Molina, a nine-time All-Star with the Cardinals, wasn’t far off at .711 — but the problem was Stallings had little help.</p>
<p>Elias Diaz hit .194 with four extra-base hits after the All-Star break and finished the year with a .603 OPS, second-worst in baseball among catchers with at least 300 plate appearances. Meanwhile,&nbsp;Francisco Cervelli played only 34 games for the Pirates because of concussion problems before they granted him his release, allowing the fan favorite to pursue other opportunities.</p>
<p>Since the time he was hired, general manager Ben Cherington has acknowledged that the Pirates would like to add to the catching position, while many fans and analysts theorized that maybe they’d actually plunk down a few dollars on free agents such as Jason Castro, Robinson Chirinos or even Austin Romine.</p>
<p>It didn’t quite work out that way.</p>
<p>The Pirates instead prioritized defense, signing Luke Maile despite the fact that he hit just .151 in 44 games last season, relying more on the fact that he finished 16th among all MLB catchers in adjusted fielding runs above average in 2019 according to Baseball Prospectus.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Maile does everything you could want defensively, but he hasn’t shown a ton with his bat; his best offensive season came in 2018, when Maile slashed .248/.333/.366 and had an OPS of .700.</span></p>
<p>That, the Pirates had to figure, would be good enough for an improvement here, in large part because the bar was so low.&nbsp;But is it enough? Doubtful.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Back when the Pirates made three consecutive playoff appearances, they found a competitive advantage behind the plate. Whether it was Martin or Cervelli, Pirates catchers from 2013-15 had an OPS of .735 that was fifth-best in all of baseball and No. 3 in the NL.</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, only the Giants (.280) had a better batting average than the Pirates (.270), while Pittsburgh backstops also finished second to San Francisco — because of Buster Posey — in catcher WAR, 21.3 to 19.7.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The “worst” season in there came in 2013, when Pirates catchers were worth a combined 4.6 WAR, but even that dwarfs what the group did in 2019, when it was worth minus-0.4 WAR, down from 4.2 the year before.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">For the Pirates to surprise some people from behind the plate, they’ll need Maile to recapture what he did in 2018, when he enjoyed a hot start and settled into a groove.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Maile said shortly after he signed that a consistent problem has been trying to do too much because he feels like he needs to reverse any offensive issues all at once, which will elongate his swing and throw everything out of whack.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">As for Murphy, who tied for the Pirates’ spring training lead with three home runs, he’ll need a pretty big bounce-back year after hitting .175 and .202 the past two season, though he did have a career-high nine home runs and 24 RBIs with the Diamondbacks in 2018.</span></p>
<p>“I tried to learn as much as I could about myself, especially as far as how my body’s moving,” Murphy said of his offseason work. “Once I did that, I paired that with all the data that I’ve put on tape the last two seasons and tried to figure out a plan from there.”</p>
<p>Still, the bulk of the offensive uptick — assuming there is one — will have to come from Stallings, the unlikely starter. Stallings appeared in just 24 MLB games before last season, when he saw action in 71 and had 210 plate appearances.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">After a year of getting comfortable, the Pirates are likely hoping to see more offensive production from Stallings in the year ahead.</span></p>
<p>“Hitting did not come easy to me,” Stallings said. “It’s something I really worked at. It was cool to do well last year. Working with [hitting coach] Rick [Eckstein] was huge for me. I was so excited when I heard he was coming back.</p>
<p>“I’ve always felt like I have a good swing. Getting in a position to hit with my big, lanky body has been challenging for me. Working with him on that was huge for me.”</p>
<p><strong>STATISTICALLY SPEAKING:</strong> While Pirates catchers combined for an MLB-worst 47 RBIs in 2019, seven teams had their backstops drive in 100 or more, including the Rays and Brewers.</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THIS:</strong> Of the top 10 teams in catchers’ OPS in 2019, five made the postseason. When looking at the bottom 10, only one — the Rays — advanced to the playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>HE SAID IT:</strong> “He’s got me in a position where I feel like I can do damage again. I can’t wait to see where it goes.” — Maile on working with Eckstein this spring.</p>
