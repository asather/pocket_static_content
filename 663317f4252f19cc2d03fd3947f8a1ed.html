<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Country singer Cady Groves, who was only 30 years old, has died of apparent “natural causes," her brother said in a statement Sunday.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma native, best known for her 2011 hit “This Little Girl,” had some medical problems last fall and the family believes they may have resurfaced. Her brother Cody Groves said an autopsy conducted over the weekend found no signs of foul play or self-harm.&nbsp;She wasn't tested for COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Cady was really looking forward to the next few months and release of her new album,” he wrote. “Our latest in depth conversation (since most were witty banter) was her sending me songs to critique and give feedback on.”</p>
<p>Born in Emporia, Kan.,&nbsp;Groves first found success in 2009 and 2010 with a pair of acoustic-pop albums, "A Month of Sundays" and "The Life of a Pirate." The albums, particularly fan favorite "The Life of a Pirate," earned Groves notable online exposure and aided in her signing with RCA Records.</p>
<p>During her major label career, Groves released a number of empowering pop singles, including "This Little Girl," "We're The S***" and "Love Actually." She shared the stage with notable pop-punk and pop-rock acts at the time of her emergence, with Good Charlotte, Boys Like Girls and All Time Low among them.</p>
<p>Groves' latest music, the independently-released EP "Dreams," debuted in 2015. It featured the singles "Oil &amp; Water" and "Crying Game."</p>
<p>According to the statement, Groves was working on new country music with songwriters at Nashville-based publishing company SMACKSongs.</p>
<p>Groves "had recently signed with the Thirty Tigers label, with a summer 2020 release in the works," the statement said. Groves' family hopes to posthumously release the music.</p>
<p>The singer-songwriter, who lived in Tennessee, is the third sibling in the family to die at a young age. The other two suffered from prescription drug abuse and both died at age 28, The Oklahoman reported in 2014.</p>
<p>One of many people to pay tribute to Cady Groves on social media was Time magazine editor Sam Lansky, who was friends with her for nearly a decade and described her music as “big, anthemic country-tinged power pop.”</p>
<p>“My friend Cady Groves died yesterday, which is strange because Cady was more alive than maybe anyone I’ve ever met,” Lansky wrote Sunday in an Instagram post. “She was so wild and funny and fiery.</p>
<p>“She was one of the most gifted songwriters I’ve ever met, and her voice could communicate the subtlest longing, go from bratty to heartbreaking in an instant,” he added. “Every song she wrote sounded like the song the heroine in your favorite teen movie sings at the climax… I don’t understand why the world never got to hear so many of those songs.”</p>
<p>Singer Brian Dales called her a “truly underestimated masterclass of talent.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never worked with any songwriter who could open a vein and get vulnerable the way Cady Groves could,” he tweeted. “We wrote a lot of songs together for a while and I was inspired by her time after time.”</p>
