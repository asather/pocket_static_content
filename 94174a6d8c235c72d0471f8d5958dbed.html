<h1>Obituary: Jim Hoey, a former fly shop owner, told some of the best fishing stories</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Some fishermen cherish the solitude they find in moments alone on the water. Others enjoy reeling in the company of other anglers.</p>
<p>The former owner of two Pittsburgh-area fly shops, Jim Hoey was a prominent member of the regional fly fishing community who enjoyed his status as bearer of some of the best fish stories. Mr. Hoey died July 12 from heart failure at a hospice in Colorado. He was 76.</p>
<p>A resident of Dormont, Mr. Hoey closed his first Perry Highway store in McCandless and reopened Hoey’s Fly Fishing Shop several miles to the south in Ross. He followed customers browsing through the long narrow space offering advice about the tying materials displayed on the walls. Often he would lean against a center display table to swap news about fly hatches and discuss preferred patterns.</p>
<p>“He was a very personable man. I knew him through Trout Unlimited,” said Ron Milavec, manager of the Upper St. Clair Fly Fishing Club. “He was a grand old gentleman who always had a story to tell.”</p>
<p>Christian Shane, an officer with Penn’s Woods West Trout Unlimited, said while it can be difficult to find lasting fishing buddies, he enjoyed fishing with Mr. Hoey.</p>
<p>“He fished the way I fish. He tied his own flies, was a catch-and-release guy and he wasn’t just catch, catch, catch. He was a&nbsp;patient angler. He liked to appreciate his surroundings. Sometimes, we’d just sit and watch.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hoey combined his passions for fishing and writing. He reviewed books about fly fishing and penned outdoors poetry and dark fly fishing fiction for the TU chapter’s newsletter.</p>
<p>“Last time I fished with him was during the big cicada hatch in 2012,” said Mr. Shane. “We were up on Spruce Creek and the [Little Juniata River in Huntingdon County] with some flies we got from the local fly shop. They weren’t working. I pulled out some big flies from my trip to Utah that floated higher on the water, and we started catching fish. Jim caught a really nice rainbow [trout]. I remember him holding it up, and we were just giddy.”</p>
<p>James Caldwell Hoey was the youngest child of Peter Francis Hoey and Mary Elizabeth Caldwell. He lived most of his life in Crafton, Monroeville and Dormont and studied journalism at Robert Morris College. In October 1982, he married Shari Rheam, mother of Kim and Kara Hemphill.</p>
<p>“He was always telling&nbsp;‘dad’ jokes and loved puns,” said his daughter Kim Hemphill Erdner, of Bellevue.&nbsp;“I always thought that if [he] lived in the Old West he’d be one of those guys sitting outside the drugstore playing checkers and talking to everyone who went by. He just loved hanging out and talking fishing with the guys and taking fishing trips.”</p>
<p>He attended North Way Christian Community Church in Oakland and West Ridge Christian Church in Coraopolis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Semi-retired after closing the fly shop, Mr. Hoey worked in the fishing department at Field and Stream in Cranberry before retiring with his wife in Colorado.</p>
<p>He was preceded in death by his father, mother, brother Francis and sisters Clara, Marie and Joan. He is survived by his wife Sharon Hoey, who has remained in Colorado Springs, and daughters Kim Hemphill Erdner and Kara Hemphill, of Colorado, as well as son-in-law Ken Erdner, sister-in-law Jill (Dallas) Brown and nephew Josh Brown, and nieces Amy (Gregg) Cale and Corrie (Tim) Macneil.</p>
<p>Due to COVID-19 restrictions, a memorial is not expected to be held until autumn. Mr. Hoey’s ashes are to be scattered into Colorado trout streams. Send condolences to Sharon Hoey, 5353 Palomino Ranch Point, Unit 204, Colorado Springs, CO 80922-6117.</p>
