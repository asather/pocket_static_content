<h1>Pirates mailbag: Will they settle on a fifth starter or stick with the piggyback?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Hello, everyone. Here’s my inaugural Pirates mailbag. As always, Jason Mackey will continue the weekly Pirates chat, but I’ll be manning the mailbag going forward on Mondays. If you read this and are inspired to ask your own question, you can do so on Twitter @MikeDPersak or via email (<a href="mailto:mpersak@post-gazette.com" target="_blank">mpersak@post-gazette.com</a>). Hope to keep things light and fun around here. We’ll see if we can do that:</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. VanNorstrum (@DrNorstrum):&nbsp;</strong>Here’s one: Why do a Pirates mailbag?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>Light and fun, Doc! I said light and fun!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Logan Carney (@Lucky9_9):&nbsp;</strong>With no fans in the stands, making the games quieter, will we see more ejections similar to the Derek Holland one this season?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>Manager Derek Shelton was actually asked if Holland’s ejection may have resulted from the lack of fans drowning out his voice. Shelton didn’t care to speculate. I, however, do care to speculate! Basically, I think the answer is yes, simply because we already saw it once. Players have obviously been ejected from the dugout before, but I mean, Holland was sitting farther down the line and out of view of the broadcasters at least. People didn’t even immediately know who was ejected. I don’t think players are going to get tossed left and right all season, but even a few more player-ejected-from-the-stands-or-dugout situations this year would be more than usual.</p>
<p><strong>Ray Greyfox (@RayGreyfox):&nbsp;</strong>Can you name the current players on the Bucs active roster who were added via the trades of&nbsp;McCutchen,&nbsp;Cole,&nbsp;Baz,&nbsp;Meadows,&nbsp;Glasnow,&nbsp;Marte?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>Sure! Bryan Reynolds and Kyle Crick came over from San Francisco in the Cutch trade. Joe Musgrove, Colin Moran, Michael Feliz and Jason Martin were the four players in the Cole Trade. The Glasnow-Meadows-Baz deal netted Chris Archer. The Marte deal got Liover Peguero and Brennan Malone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the nine players the Pirates acquired, six of them are on the current roster, Archer is out for the year after surgery and the Marte pieces are young minor leaguers. Peguero is, however, working out in Altoona with the alternate training squad.</p>
<p><strong>Elena Graves:&nbsp;</strong>What is the current status of Socrates Brito? Did he elect to become a free agent or report to Altoona? When is the deadline for his decision?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>Brito is in Altoona. The deal here is that the Pirates would have had to promote him to the 40-man roster for him to start the season with the Pirates. But with Gregory Polanco coming back soon, they would have then had to put Brito on waivers to send him back to Altoona, which would risk losing him to another team. Jason Martin, who did join the team seemingly until Polanco comes back, can just be sent down to Altoona without any waiver stuff. It comes down to service time sort of stuff, but Brito is still an option if they need him later in the year.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas (@TeznasGV):&nbsp;</strong>Earlier there was some noise that the Pirates should trade for Clint Frazier. Do you think that would be in the best interests of the club at this point? And what would a trade look like to you?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>I don’t, honestly. If we were talking a year or two in the future, then sure. To me, the Pirates have three everyday outfielders when Polanco gets back. Dyson would have to be the odd man out if Frazier were to come over. Then, who do you put in center? Bryan Reynolds has done it, but I think the defense takes a big hit if you run out Frazier-Reynolds-Polanco, even if the offensive upside does improve.</p>
<p>I’m not even sure how to hazard a guess at what a deal might look like. It isn’t like the Yankees are thirsting for big-league talent, and I think it would take a substantial haul of prospects to land Frazier I think somebody needs to give Frazier a shot soon. I don’t think it should be the Pirates, because the timeline isn’t quite right to justify the price.</p>
<p><strong>Nathan (@NateMutzka):&nbsp;</strong>Do you expect a true fifth starter or do you think they will piggyback all year?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>I think it’s going to have to be a fifth starter. Unless the piggyback works incredibly well, I don’t think the Pirates will keep such a specific role player on the team once they have to cut the rosters. Now, I do think they could keep both Steven Brault and Chad Kuhl, assuming those are the piggybackers, and perhaps alternate them in the fifth rotation spot, piggyback if both happen to be rested and on schedule for the same game or just use one as a long reliever. They have some time to figure that out, even if it isn’t a lot of time.</p>
<p><strong>Brandon (@branrussell9): Nick&nbsp;</strong>Burdi has to be the closer after that showing right?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>His stuff looked awfully closer-esque, didn’t it? That role is still Keone Kela’s when he comes back, but I would personally like to see Burdi get his shot at it. May take some lumps along the way, but I think he may have the most shutdown, nasty stuff out of the bullpen.</p>
<p><strong>dundermifflin (@jma343):&nbsp;</strong>What is Cole Tucker’s future with the organization? Seems like there are plenty of shortstops coming up with higher ceilings.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>We will see how the Great Tucker Outfield Experiment plays out. What is going to define Tucker’s future is his bat. If he finds his hitting stroke, maybe the Pirates let Adam Frazier, who is on a one-year deal but is arbitration eligible again next offseason, walk in the near future and bring Tucker back to the infield. Maybe they keep both and use Tucker as the Dyson replacement in center field. Tucker will get plenty of opportunities around the diamond, because the Pirates believe in him and want to see what he’s got. The ball is in his court, though, in that he needs to hit to stick around.</p>
<p><strong>Teddy Gutkin: (@teddygutkin):&nbsp;</strong>Compare everyone in the Pirates starting lineup to a Super Smash Bros. character.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>I don’t think I can do this in full, but Josh Bell is undoubtedly Samus. Same sized shoulders.</p>
