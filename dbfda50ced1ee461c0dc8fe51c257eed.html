<p><strong>Superintendent Edward Wehrer, Steel Valley School District.</strong></p>
<p>Edward Wehrer, 53, is Munhall born and bred. So are his parents, three of his four grandparents and all of his wife’s family. He lives there today with his fraternal twin 10-year-old daughters. Mr. Wehrer grew up in a family of mill workers who were employed at the U.S. Steel Homestead Works. He graduated from Steel Valley as valedictorian in 1984, which he proclaims to be the greatest class the district ever had, unlike the Class of 1985, he said, which included his former high school football teammate Jim Tomsula, now a defensive line coach with the Dallas Cowboys. Mr. Wehrer proudly notes that two former players he coached at Steel Valley are also with the NFL — former quarterback Luke Getsy, who now coaches the Green Bay Packers’ QB Aaron Rodgers, and Jeff Blasko, an assistant offensive line coach for the Cowboys. Mr. Wehrer went to Yale and casually drops references to Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy and Plato.</p>
<p><strong>It was announced at the end of last month that two members of your district traveled to active coronavirus areas? How are they?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>“We have to be careful talking about personnel, but they are well. School got closed before they had the opportunity to come back. We took what we thought were prudent measures to protect our staff and students. The past couple of weeks have proven that was a good decision, but those folks are well.”</p>
<p><strong>Last year you dealt with bedbugs in the district. This year it’s coronavirus. What could be next?</strong></p>
<p>“I don’t know. Are those two of the signs of the impending apocalypse? I’m not sure.”</p>
<p><strong>How is everyone coping with the school closure?</strong></p>
<p>“The shift to what appears to be a new normal has been unsettling, I think, for everybody, whether you’re a parent, whether&nbsp;you’re a student, whether you’re an employee of the district. There’s a lot of uncertainty right now. There’s uncertainty in terms of the virus, there’s uncertainty in terms of our lives. A lot of people worrying about, ‘Will I get paid? Will have a job? What’s going to happen during this time period?’ When you have times of crisis I think communities bond together, and that’s what I think what ours is doing. But for those who had a disadvantage before the crisis, it has a bigger impact. ... We’re an area that’s proudly working class, but we know we have some folks who are really going to be struggling during this time frame.”</p>
<p><strong>What is the situation with internet connectivity in your district and how will you tackle remote learning?</strong></p>
<p>“I believe this is an ethical quandary for districts and for the commonwealth as a whole. Our community is an example that not everybody has internet access, not everybody has devices, or if they have devices, are they reliable or do you have a data plan on your phone where at some point during the month do you run out of data? And there’s also students with disabilities. They have a broad spectrum of different needs, and it’s our responsibility to meet those needs on a daily basis when they are in school. How you provide that unique individualized support, that’s a huge challenge, and so I think that’s what is confronting people at the state Department of Education. How do you face the needs of all your learners when there’s a huge disparity between what their needs are and what your resources are at home? We’re&nbsp;all wrestling with the same thing. It’s a formidable challenge and very complex.”</p>
<p><strong>How is the education department doing?</strong></p>
<p>“They’ve been doing a fine job of trying to communicate. ... We’ve got to understand this is new ground for them, too. I don’t expect to have 100% clarity. We’re all on some level of a steep learning curve together, so I think you need to have some patience with that.&nbsp;What I’ve seen from the state is they’re learning and figuring things out, but they’ve been in regular communication. That’s all that you can really ask for at this point, is keep us informed. The state&nbsp;has 500 school districts that are dealing with different topics. Most of the state is rural, so they’re dealing with even greater diversity of challenges than I am, so I try to have an understanding mind about that.”</p>
<p><strong>You hold a bachelor’s degree in biology from Yale University. How did you get to such a prestigious school?</strong></p>
<p>“Somebody back in 1984 wasn’t using their brain very well. But yeah, they let me into the joint.</p>
<p>“There was a high level of expectation in my household. I think that’s a kind way of saying if you came home with less than stellar grades, dad was not going to be pleased. It was the sum of my family and my teachers and my coaches and my neighbors. I would hope that all of them would take a little bit of pride that they had an impact on me growing up. I&nbsp;was fortunate enough to be class valedictorian, and when I spoke at graduation the big part of what I said at graduation was to always remember where you came from, and if you have the opportunity, give back. I‘m trying to make sure kids growing up in this area have the same opportunities that I did.”</p>
<p><strong>You’ve worked for GNC, UPMC and nonprofits. What are some of the lessons derived from working in such diverse arenas?</strong></p>
<p>“I would like to think that I’m a learner and I’m been demonstrating that since I was very young. Each one of those stops, I gained in something along the way. In college, there’s a certain rigor of thought you need to be in science and to do it well. When I was at GNC and UPMC I was doing software development and project management. Project management is both a science and an art. You have not only the technical tasks that need to get done but the communications that need to be done to bring a project to a successful implementation. Throughout my life I’ve suffered setbacks and I’ve failed at things. The first year I was a football coach at Steel Valley we only won two games, and the second year we only won two games. Those are doses of humble pie I did not enjoy, but you learn and grow from there. Take the risks and be bold and shoot for the stars, and if you fall short, that’s not really failure, that’s just not being as successful as you would like. Failure is an option, but quitting is not.”</p>
<p><strong>In 1998, Mr. Wehrer shadowed former University of Pittsburgh football coach Walt Harris at practices and met Tom Osborn, former head coach of the University of Nebraska, who spoke about needing a personal philosophy.</strong></p>
<p>“I&nbsp;had no such thing as my personal philosophy. At that time of my life, I was really into reading Russian authors, especially Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy. You’d come across the word ‘cadre.’ A cadre of nihilists would overthrow the czar. The word cadre, I had seen it multiple times. I looked it up in the dictionary. I thought what it was going to tell me was a small group. Actually, what the definition is was ‘foundation.’ And I was like, hmm. That word resonated with me. I ended up making that my personal philosophy — the character ‘C’ is for character. The character ‘A’ is for attitude. The ‘D’ is for discipline. The ‘R’ is respect. And the ‘E’ is education. ”</p>
<p><strong>You coached football for many years. What are your thoughts on CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and whether football, particularly youth football, should still be played with full contact?</strong></p>
<p>“The easiest way for me to answer that is to share my own story. When I was young, I wanted to play youth football. My dad, who went to Arizona State to play football ... would not let me play when I was young. In seventh grade I was going to be one of the young kids on the midget team. I was too scared. All these kids had been playing for years. I didn’t want to play. So after bugging my dad for years, when he was finally willing to relent, I said, ‘No.’ [In eighth grade] he says,&nbsp;‘You’re going to play on the ninth grade team.So I ended up playing on the ninth grade team as an eighth grader. There was obviously nothing about CTE in the ‘70s when i was trying to decide,&nbsp;‘Can I talk my dad into playing football?’ I think my dad had the thought that you need to develop your strength level, your size level, your maturity level in order to be able to play the game of tackle football. I think if you’re taught the game properly that you can play the game safely. There is some risk. It’s a violent game. I will tell you I loved the violent part of it. I’m not going to shy away from that.&nbsp;The collisions that are part of the game really appeal to me. I’m not sure what it says about me, but it does. I think it can be played safely. ... I don’t think that CTE should drive all families to decide there’s better things to do than play football for their sons.”</p>
<p><strong>How are your kids holding up during the COVID-19 crisis?</strong></p>
<p>“I think all of our students are really finding out how much they like school. It’s one thing to have Christmas break because that’s planned. But to have it taken away from you when the expectation is that you’re going to be there, that’s a rude slap to the face. I think it was either Monday evening or Tuesday evening my one daughter was telling me how much she wanted to go to school the next day. And that was only after a day or two. Adjusting to this new normal for kids, it’s extremely tough. As much as school provides an educational setting, it provides a social setting, it provides a health setting. I’m concerned about the learning needs of our students. I’m more concerned about their emotional needs, their social needs and the needs of their families and the community overall. How are my daughters chewing up their time? Unfortunately, I think there’s a little more television than I would like. They are using their technology to FaceTime their friends. We have a piano in the house. One does saxophone, the other does the clarinet. Part of their day is taken up by practicing their instruments and the piano also.”</p>
