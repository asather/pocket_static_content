<h1>Joe Biden declares victory in South Carolina: ‘This campaign has taken off’</h1>

<p>COLUMBIA, S.C. — Joe Biden’s supporters who gathered in an athletics center here didn’t have to wait very long.</p>
<p>Within minutes of the polls closing, Mr. Biden, the former vice president, was declared the winner of the South Carolina Democratic primary.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden led with 48.6% of the vote in the Palmetto State, with nearly all precincts reporting as of 11:30 p.m. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was in second with 19.8%, and businessman Tom Steyer came in third with 11.4%. About 98% of precincts were reporting.</p>
<p>Mr. Steyer announced late Saturday night that he was dropping out of the race for the nomination.</p>
<p>South Carolina delivered a crucial first win for Mr. Biden, who had said his run for the Democratic presidential nomination hinged on winning — and by a significant margin — in the Palmetto State.</p>
<p>“Just days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead,” said Mr. Biden, all smiles, to hundreds of supporters in the Carolina Volleyball Center at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, the state capital.</p>
<p>“Now thanks to all of you — the heart of the Democratic party — we just won and we won big,” he said. “We are very much alive.”</p>
<p>“This campaign has taken off,” he declared.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s victory was widely expected in the “First in the South” election, where he led by double-digits in the polls for months. He was buoyed by his popularity among black voters, who make up roughly 65% of registered Democratic voters in South Carolina.</p>
<p>But Mr. Biden’s margin of victory was even larger than recent polling indicated. Mr. Sanders, as he scooped up the most delegates from the first three state contests, had eaten into Mr. Biden’s lead this month.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, if his share of the vote holds, likely will be awarded about 39 of the state’s 54 total delegates. That would put him in the lead in total delegates heading into Super Tuesday on March 3.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders would receive the other 15 delegates. The Democratic primary process awards delegates to candidates who garner at least 15% of the vote in each state.</p>
<p>“Tonight, we did not win in South Carolina,” Mr. Sanders told supporters in Virginia, one of 14 states to vote next week. “A lot of states in this country — nobody wins them all. Now we enter Super Tuesday.”</p>
<p>After the speedy result, supporters watched an MSNBC broadcast of the numbers rolling in. Mr. Biden was leading in all of South Carolina’s 46 counties.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden took the stage around 8:50 p.m. for a 10-minute victory speech. He was introduced by Rep. Jim Clyburn, a top House Democrat who has represented the South Carolina Lowlands in Congress since 1993. Mr. Clyburn endorsed Mr. Biden on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“This year is about the goodness of America,” Mr. Clyburn said. “And we have, as our candidate, a real good man.”</p>
<p>“You do not have to be bombastic in order to get your point across,” he said. “You do not have to call people names in order to have your positions understood. You don’t have to tell falsehoods in order to make headlines.”</p>
<p>He portrayed the upcoming Super Tuesday contests, in which voters in 14 states go to the polls, as determining the outcome of the primary.</p>
<p>“This is the moment to choose the path forward for our party,” Mr. Biden said, adding that moment arrived “maybe sooner than anyone guessed it would.”</p>
<p>“The decision Democrats make all across America in the next few days will determine what this party stands for, what we believe and what we’ll get done,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden promised he would “build the legacy” of former President Barack Obama, who selected him as his running mate in 2008, saying that America deserved a real “Obama-Biden Democrat.”</p>
<p>As he has all along, Mr. Biden urged the country to unite behind him in rejecting President Donald Trump, who he said has divided the country.</p>
<p>“If the Democrats nominate me, I believe we can beat Donald Trump,” he said, adding, “We have the option of winning big or losing big. That’s the choice.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump used Mr. Biden’s victory to take a dig at Mike Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, on Twitter.</p>
<p>“Sleepy Joe Biden’s victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg’s Joke of a campaign,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates, Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters, taking many away!”</p>
<p>The South Carolina outcome was the biggest indicator yet of black voters’ preference. African-Americans made up more than half of all voters in preliminary exit polling data. Black voters’ share was 11% in Nevada and 3% in New Hampshire’s primary and Iowa’s caucuses.</p>
<p>Voting across the state on Saturday was fairly smooth, aside from some confusion over changes in polling locations — the Saturday election meant that usual weekday polling stations had been closed or merged with others.</p>
<p>The number of absentee ballots processed by the state also swelled.</p>
<p>Total absentee ballots returned by voters totaled 75,209, an increase of 39% compared to the 2016 Democratic primary, according to data released Saturday by the South Carolina State Election Commission.</p>
