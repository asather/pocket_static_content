<h1>Penguins on pause: Will Patrick Marleau get another shot at a Cup run?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>Two Olympic gold medals. One of the NHL’s longest Iron Man streaks. More than 1,700 games played and enough goals to crack the top 25 all-time list.</p>
<p>Patrick Marleau really has done it all during his 22-year NHL career. Well, everything except hoist the Stanley Cup.</p>
<p>On the NHL’s deadline day, the Penguins acquired Marleau from San Jose in exchange for a conditional 2021 third-round pick, giving the veteran one of his last chances to join a Stanley Cup contender. The pick becomes a second-round draft choice if the Penguins win the Stanley Cup, something all parties involved are rooting for.</p>
<p>At 40-years-old, Marleau isn’t necessarily the same player who scored 44 goals during the 2009-10 season. He’s been in the league about as long as 22-year-old rookie defenseman John Marino has been on Earth.&nbsp;Yet, despite his age and the wear on his tires, the Penguins still believe Marleau has the wheels to play in Mike Sullivan’s speed-oriented system.</p>
<p>Marleau was still settling into the Penguins’ system when the season was paused on March 12. He had recorded one goal and an assist in eight games.&nbsp;For the most part, Marleau played in the top-six alongside Evgeni Malkin. He also earned some time on the second power-play unit.</p>
<p>With the Penguins getting healthier, Marleau’s presence should add quality depth to the lineup, no matter where he ultimately plays.&nbsp;Now, only time will tell if or when Marleau will get a shot to capture the Cup that’s eluded him.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> During the first period of a 6-2 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes, Conor Sheary found Marleau just as he was crossing the offensive blue line. Marleau skated through three Canes and backhanded the puck past goalie Alex Nedeljkovic, showing the speed and skill that made the Penguins confident in the rental.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> Marleau has played in 854 consecutive games, the fifth-longest streak in NHL history. He trails only Keith Yandle (866), Steve Larmer (884), Gary Unger (914) and Doug Jarvis (964).</p>
<p>Should the NHL choose to go directly into the postseason or cancel the rest of this season entirely, Marleau will have missed out on the opportunity to add 13 more regular season games to a streak that dates back to April 9, 2009.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> The Penguins are getting healthier. Jake Guentzel’s return, in particular, could bump Marleau out of a top-six role. But no matter where Marleau ultimately settles, he’ll add quality depth and veteran experience.</p>
<p>If the season doesn’t resume, the situation is more interesting. The Penguins gave up a draft choice with the expectation that Marleau would be here for a playoff run. The NHL might have to work out some type of compensation system for teams that gave up assets for rentals that they never got to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Marleau, who counts just $700,000 against the cap, will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of this season. Despite his age, Marleau said he “definitely” would like to play another season. But where?</p>
<p>Marleau said he believes the “door is open” for another return to the Sharks, which makes San Jose the most likely option. However, if Marleau again agrees to a $700,000 deal, the Penguins won’t find too many players of Marleau’s caliber for that price tag. And Marleau won’t find many places with a better chance to finally win a Cup.</p>
