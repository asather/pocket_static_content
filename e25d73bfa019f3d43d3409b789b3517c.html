<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County has one new death — a woman over the age of 70 —&nbsp;and 17 new cases of COVID-19, according to the latest figures released Tuesday by the county health department. A new death also was reported in Washington County.</p>
<p>With the new data,&nbsp;Allegheny County’s death toll from the coronavirus is 144 people — 133 confirmed and 11 probable.</p>
<p>Since the county’s first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 14, it now has had 1,658 cases — 1,569 confirmed and 89 probable. A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to the county.</p>
<p>Additionally, there have been 304 past or present hospitalizations related to COVID-19. Of those, 121 have required admission to the intensive care unit and 67 needed mechanical ventilation.&nbsp;Allegheny County has administered 25,048 tests, with 682 in the last 24-hour period. County health department director Dr. Debra Bogen has said that the county has the capacity to administer roughly 2,000 tests per day.</p>

<p>The number of those infected with COVID-19 in Pennsylvania jumped by 610 cases on Tuesday, bringing the statewide total to 63,666, according to the state Department of Health.</p>
<p>Monday marked a change in how deaths are being reported throughout the state. Dr. Rachel Levine, the state’s health secretary, said Pennsylvania has made a switch from the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) to the Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS), which brings it into alignment with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Levine said the switch allows the state to record deaths in two different ways:</p>
<p>• A person’s death will be counted in the county in which they had a permanent residence.</p>
<p>• If that person required care at a health facility or nursing home, that person’s death will also be tied to that facility, which may be in a different county from the person’s permanent address.</p>
<p>“It’s not double reporting,” Dr. Levine said,&nbsp;“but two different data sets.”</p>
<p>On Monday, the state health department reported 87 new deaths, bringing the statewide total to 4,505. In the data below, particular in the listings of deaths by county and nursing homes, there may be large changes in the data compared to the previous day. That is reflective of the adjustment to the new EDRS system.</p>
