<h1>Gov. Wolf will allow some outdoor businesses — like golf courses and fishing tours — to reopen</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A number of outdoor activities, closed to help mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be allowed beginning Friday in a new order issued by Gov. Tom Wolf.</p>
<p>The updated list to life-sustaining businesses now includes golf courses, marinas, privately owned campgrounds and guided fishing trips to help&nbsp;“maintain positive physical and mental health.”</p>

<p>The businesses must follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/visitors.html" target="_blank">updated federal guidance</a> so that&nbsp;“recreational industries can resume activities while prioritizing public health and safety.”</p>
<p>Campgrounds in state parks will remain closed through May 14, the statement said.</p>
<p>“Pennsylvanians have remained resilient throughout this COVID-19 crisis, and as we successfully continue to flatten the curve to protect our physical health, it is critical that we also focus on our physical and mental health during these extraordinary times,” Mr. Wolf said.&nbsp;“As the weather warms and daylight lengthens, enjoying time outdoors is an important way to manage stress. As we start to take measured, limited steps to reopen our commonwealth, reopening these industries will help to rebuild our economy and strengthen our mental health.”</p>
