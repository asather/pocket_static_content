<h1>Landon Alexander, Central Valley roll past Keystone Oaks to stay unbeaten</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of these weeks the Central Valley starters might actually finish a game.</p>
<p>It certainly didn’t happen against Keystone Oaks.</p>
<p>By the end of the game, several of the Warriors starters were standing on the sideline watching younger players gain experience, their job finished early. And it was a job well done.</p>
<p>Central Valley (5-0, 3-0) shrugged off an early turnover and scored on their final six possessions of the first half — throwing in a safety and a blocked punt for a touchdown for good measure — as the Class 3A No. 1-Warriors decimated No. 4 Keystone Oaks (3-2, 2-1), 65-14, in a running clock win that had first place on the line in the Northwestern Six Conference.</p>
<p>“Here’s the thing, our guys have been so excited to get in an atmosphere game and I think a lot of high school kids think the same way,” Central Valley coach Mark Lyons said. “This was the first time we got our student body here, we had a nice crowd, but at the end of the day, our kids love Friday nights and they had an atmosphere and an opportunity to perform in front of the home crowd with a little buzz.”</p>
<p>This was the first week teams played after Gov. Tom Wolf relaxed crowd restrictions because of COVID-19, and Landon Alexander certainly played to the crowd as he ran over, around and through the Keystone Oaks defense throughout the first half. The junior running back racked up a career-high 201 yards and two touchdowns on just eight carries, including a 69-yard burst up the middle on the first play of the second half.</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to get to 200 but I have to thank my linemen because I really can’t do it without them and I always thank them in the huddle because without them, I can’t run like that,” Alexander said. “It’s different with coronavirus and because it’s obviously a setback and we’re just fortunate to have a season and, having the fans, here and the student section on the hill, having the fans here is just great.”</p>
<p>Central Valley owned the ground game in the first half as it opened a 255-30 edge running the ball thanks to Alexander and a 63-yard jet sweep for a touchdown from senior wide receiver Myles Walker. It didn’t help that Keystone Oaks squandered a couple of opportunities, including a dropped pass down the right sideline on what would have been a first-half touchdown.</p>
<p>“We kind of shot ourselves in the foot a little bit and, when you play a good team like this, you can’t kill yourself,” Keystone Oaks coach Greg Perry said. “We had a drop, we had a couple missed blocking assignments up front, we had a tipped ball get intercepted and, when you come in and play the level of athletes they have, you can’t beat yourself and, in that first half, we made too many mistakes.”</p>
<p>Central Valley quarterback Ameer Dudley threw an interception on his first attempt of the game, but he overcame the early wobble and completed 6 of his next 7 for 68 yards and two touchdowns, including a perfect 11-yard slant to Walker midway through the second quarter.</p>
<p>Outside of the early turnover, Keystone Oaks couldn’t generate any rhythm on either side of the ball. Central Valley outgained the Golden Eagles, 323-108, in the first half and 63 yards of that was generated in a late first-half drive capped by a 10-yard Kevin Drew touchdown run that ended the shutout bid.</p>
<p>Central Valley has scored at least 49 points in all five of its games this season, but this was the team’s second-highest offensive output all time and best since a 67-0 victory Sept. 5, 2014 against Blackhawk. It was also the most points Keystone Oaks had allowed since a 77-49 loss on Sept. 23, 2016 to Beaver.</p>
<p>Although rolling to big victories is nice, there is going to come a time when Central Valley will have to play a full 48 minutes. And the team is extremely cognizant of that fact.</p>
<p>“They’re veterans and we talk every day about understanding that, at some point, you’re going to get into a dogfight,” Lyons said. “They know that and it’s tough to make sure they get their work, but the week of practice prepares them.”</p>
