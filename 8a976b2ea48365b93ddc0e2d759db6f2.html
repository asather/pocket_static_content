<h1>So, interested in a little information on COVID-19, or a lot?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For many college students and their parents, simply knowing a campus has a well-laid COVID-19 safety plan might suffice. No point counting up every mask in the supply closet, right?</p>
<p>But for those who need more detail to rest easy — right down to cough and sneeze etiquette and how long disinfectant spray should remain on surfaces —&nbsp;Robert Morris University has a 26-page manual.</p>
<p>Titled <a href="https://www.rmu.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/rmu_ready_plan.pdf" target="_blank">“RMU Ready Plan,</a>” it is just one example of the mountain of wordage produced by colleges and universities that are under pressure on the one hand to hold in-person classes, but on the other, to demonstrate that arrivals are not at undue risk —&nbsp;even amidst a pandemic.</p>
<p>Choose almost any campus —&nbsp;big ones like the University of Pittsburgh and smaller ones such as Washington &amp; Jefferson College. You will find web pages filled with advisories, updates and explainers on a pathogen unheard of less than a year ago.</p>
<p>In its manual, Robert Morris says anytime someone tests positive for the virus, the school activates a response protocol developed by the Emergency Management Subcommittee of RMU’s Safety Committee.</p>
<p>Actions include:&nbsp;Initial investigation and coordination with university health services, medical provider(s), and the Allegheny County Health Department; quarantine/isolation, as appropriate; testing; cleaning of affected area(s); contact tracing, and communication with affected students, faculty and/or staff.</p>
<p>An infected individual’s dorm room is not automatically closed off, though it could be, said RMU spokesman Jonathan Potts.</p>
<p>“We would make that determination on a case-by-case basis,” he said. “Cleaning could include their residence hall room, classroom, or other campus facilities we deem necessary.”</p>
<p>The same applies to rooms where an infected employee spent time.&nbsp;That’s in addition to regular cleaning to thwart the virus.</p>
<p>“Classrooms are disinfected twice daily,” Mr. Potts explained. “In addition, in high-traffic buildings, areas such as restrooms, building entrances, door knobs, light switches, etc. also get disinfected twice daily.”</p>
<p>According to the manual, enhanced cleaning and disinfecting means use a product approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>“All classrooms will have a ready-to-use disinfectant and paper towel dispensers,” the manual states. “The product can also be misted and allowed to air dry. It is recommended that the product stays in contact with surfaces for one minute before being wiped down.”</p>
<p><strong>Getting the message out</strong></p>
<p>Make no mistake, a pandemic that has claimed 187,000-plus lives in the U.S. is serious business. Case spikes at many colleges —&nbsp;some well into the hundreds —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/09/02/Lock-Haven-University-coronavirus-COVID-19-state-system-Pennsylvania-fall-classes-Pignatello/stories/202009020083" target="_blank">have forced in-person fall classes online</a>, and sent some students home.</p>
<p>One school, Gettysburg College asked its students last week&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gettysburg.edu/opening/status/" target="_blank">to stay in their rooms</a> for&nbsp;all but takeout meals, restroom breaks and COVID-19 testing, as tests revealed 32 infections out of 896 tested by the school with 2,600 students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Campuses sometimes deliver their safety messages with a light touch, such as the upbeat, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EhlMOKsggE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=CarnegieMellonUniversity" target="_blank">five-minute video</a> at Carnegie Mellon University whose narrator gamely reminds individuals about required social distancing of six feet.</p>
<p>As she speaks, two men stand at opposite ends of a narrow beam holding up six replicas of CMU’s foot-long Scottish Terrier mascot, “Scotty.”</p>
<p>“That’s six Scotties apart,” she says.</p>
<p>Penn State University deployed its own star power in a video featuring the<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2016/04/01/Penn-State-s-Mike-the-Mailman-calls-it-quits-after-48-years/stories/201604010076" target="_blank"> iconic but now-retired “Mike the Mailman,”</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;a postal employee at University Park familiar to Penn Staters for half a century.</p>
<p>Clad in a blue-and-white Penn State shirt instead of his familiar postal uniform, <a href="https://twitter.com/penn_state/status/1300463585253101574?s=11" target="_blank">Mike Herr implores students</a> to support the university’s “Mask up or Pack Up” campaign by social distancing so they can have a real Penn State residential experience. He then pulls a mask over his face and delivers the punchline: “So easy a mailman can do it.”</p>
<p>For months, the state’s flagship public university has churned out on its website&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/covidtesting" target="_blank">material about pre-</a> and post-arrival <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/629170/2020/08/21/campus-life/random-surveillance-testing-begins-penn-state-students-employees" target="_blank">virus testing</a>, <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/625930/2020/07/16/campus-life/inn-serve-classroom-space-eastview-terrace-host-isolation-space" target="_blank">where infected students can isolate</a> (one of 400 singles set aside in Eastview Terrace buildings), plus <a href="https://psu.app.box.com/v/COVIDResearchVisits" target="_blank">standards for protecting from infection researchers and human subjects</a>, and even daily <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/626715/2020/07/24/campus-life/cata-announces-fall-2020-service-plans#:~:text=Individuals%20will%20need%20to%20determine,be%20limited%20to%20essential%20trips.&amp;text=For%20questions%20related%20to%20CATA,email%20cata%40catabus.com." target="_blank">disinfecting of Centre Area Transportation Authority buses</a> with industrial electrostatic cleaning and sanitation.</p>
<p>There, Penn State tosses in a note of caution:&nbsp;“Individuals will need to determine if use of CATA services during the COVID-19 pandemic is right for them, but it is strongly encouraged that use be limited to essential trips,” one post advised. “Students, faculty and staff living closer to campus are encouraged to walk or bike where possible.”</p>
<p>Penn State even has <a href="https://virusinfo.psu.edu/faq/story/what-is-the-difference-between-isolation-and-quarantine-and-why-are-there-different-time-requirements" target="_blank">an 820-word explainer </a>on differences between pre-arrival self-quarantine (at least seven days before getting to campus); official quarantine (at least 14 days for those who believe they were exposed) and isolation (at least 10 days for students and employees who test positive or are showing symptoms while waiting for test results).</p>
<p>Pitt has been busy, too.</p>
<p>For months, the university has described in Zoom briefings and online reconfigured classroom plans, a modified fall calendar and its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.provost.pitt.edu/students/student-success-flexpitt" target="_blank">flex@pitt strateg</a>y that allows the&nbsp;34,000-student university to pivot — as virus threat levels change — between degrees of in-person and remote classes, while enabling students to live in dorms “de-densified” by placing some students in hotels around Oakland.</p>
<p>Pitt says on its website that <a href="https://www.coronavirus.pitt.edu/student-learning-living/quarantine-and-isolation" target="_blank">those testing positive</a> go to university-supported isolation housing where they will have access to a dedicated care team. In addition to completing the daily COVID-19 health check app, “These students will have daily check-ins with medical professionals and a support team, meals delivered and other resources …”</p>
<p>It spells out Pitt’s protocol for contact tracing in which infected individuals or those suspected of having the virus <a href="https://www.pittwire.pitt.edu/news/contact-tracing-helps-prevent-campus-community-spread-covid-19-0#:~:text=Who%20to%20contact,Bradford%3A%20814%2D362%2D5272" target="_blank">are asked about their close contacts </a>48 hours before and after showing symptoms. That way individuals can be approached by Pitt or outside health agencies.</p>
<p>But planning based on medicine and science rests heavily on how closely students follow the rules — if not for their own health, then for the sake of peers, professors or neighbors whom they might unwittingly put at risk, Pitt chancellor Patrick Gallagher recently told a gathering of new students.</p>
<p>“These health requirements are not like recommending you wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle or a bike,” he said. “That’s your head if you decide not to follow that advice. This is collective risk.”</p>
<p><strong>The 72-hour waiting period</strong></p>
<p>In general, colleges say their practices are guided by the CDC, Pennsylvania or county health departments and the World Health Organization. But approaches vary, as well as how information is shared.</p>
<p>For instance, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, which as of Friday had reported four cases, stated on its <a href="https://www.iup.edu/news-events/coronavirus-information/covid-19-dashboard/" target="_blank">COVID-19 dashboard</a> precisely how many isolation beds are available: 169. Bloomsburg University, with 249 cases as of Friday, simply says it <a href="https://bloomu.edu/coronavirus" target="_blank">has “a limited number of isolated rooms.”</a></p>
<p>But Bloomsburg is specific on whether it closes off campus rooms of students testing positive.</p>
<p>“We lock the room and close it off for 72 hours (the virus doesn’t live past 72 hours), then it is disinfected,” spokesman Thomas McGuire said in an email response last week.</p>
<p>Testing philosophies vary, too.</p>
<p>Some schools such as Allegheny College developed plans to test all arriving students and retest them after quarantine, while other campuses opted for randomized surveillance testing and sent students pre-arrival tests if coming from COVID-19 hot spots. Surveillance testing included symptomatic only or asymptomatic too, depending on the school.</p>
<p>As part of an enhanced cleaning plan, Washington &amp; Jefferson says, “Each building will have a checklist provided to the custodians to reference cleaning methods and frequencies for daily and weekly cleaning tasks.” Its plan to track and monitor maintenance of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems includes “changing of necessary filters in accordance with manufacturer’s guidelines and CDC recommendations.”</p>
<p>How to protect against a visitor carrying the virus to campus?</p>
<p>The 37-page <a href="https://covid19.duq.edu/Images/Resources/master-plan-july-10-2020.pdf" target="_blank">Reopening Duquesne University master plan</a> says until further notice university access points are reduced to Bluff and McAnulty streets, Shinglish Street, Seitz Street and Magee Street will be closed.</p>
<p>“Employees and students must display valid hang tags on their vehicles,” the plan states.</p>
<p>But the challenge may be best summed up by this note on Bloomsburg’s COVID-19 dashboard: “Due to the global pandemic, it should be assumed that the potential for COVID-19 exposure is everywhere.’’</p>
