<h1>Fans won't be allowed at Allegheny County fall high school sports</h1>

<p><em><strong>This is a developing story and will be updated:</strong></em></p>
<p>Allegheny County’s capacity limit on outdoor gatherings has been adjusted to accommodate high school sports this fall, but spectators will not be permitted to attend events.&nbsp;Those are the key points of a joint statement made Friday by the Allegheny County Health Department and WPIAL.</p>
<p>The PIAA board of directors gave the go-ahead Friday afternoon for fall high school sports in Pennsylvania to proceed despite Gov. Tom Wolf’s recommendation that school and recreation sports be postponed until Jan. 1. High school football games and contests in other fall sports will take on a much different look due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Last month, the health department mandated that outdoor gatherings include no more than 50 people.&nbsp;That limit for K-12 sports-related activities remains in place, albeit with some adjustments. Contests will be broken up into three “pods” of no greater than 50. Two of the pods consist of the sidelines (players, coaches and staff) on both sides of the field, and the other consists of the players engaged in play on the field.</p>
<p>“We are appreciative of the county being willing to work with us within the confines of their restrictions,” WPIAL executive director Amy Scheuneman said. “That will put all of the schools, at least in the WPIAL, on the same field, at least as far as maximum gathering limits. Our goal was to have all the schools on the same field.”</p>
<p>While the accommodations will come as a relief to those hoping for a season, the ban on spectators will likely not. Bands and cheerleaders will be allowed in pods of 50 as long as the total facility capacity doesn’t exceed 250.</p>
<p>“Having no fans is still under the guidance of the Pennsylvania Department of Education for the entire state. That’s not from Allegheny County,” Scheuneman said.</p>
<p>Scheuneman had phone conversations with county officials this week.</p>
<p>“Our focus was on the student-athletes first,” she said. “We’re opposed to spectators attending, but we want to have the events first. That’s been our focus.”</p>
<p>The statement lists five measures:</p>
<p>• Spectators are prohibited from attending in-person K-12 sports-related activities.</p>
<p>• Personal health assessments are expected of each participant on the day of any game.</p>
<p>• Physical distancing of 6 [feet] is required at all times when not actively engaged in competition.</p>
<p>• Coaches and staff should be masked at all times unless they meet one of the exceptions in the state’s universal face coverings order.</p>
<p>• Participants may not share uniforms, towels, apparel or equipment, and are expected to bring their own water bottle or rehydration beverages.</p>
<p>The WPIAL includes schools from nine other counties besides Allegheny. As of now, those counties are expected to adhere to the outdoor&nbsp;gathering limit of 250 people issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health in July.</p>
