<h1>Pittsburgh councilman Coghill’s district shows a united front at parks tax hearing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A united crowd of Beechview, Brookline and Carrick residents showed up in council chambers Thursday night wearing matching bright green District 4 T-shirts and holding signs that read “We Deserve Our Fair Share.”</p>
<p>The share they want is one-ninth of the new parks tax revenue, the subject of an hourslong public hearing.</p>
<p>“Carrick is certainly an underserved neighborhood,” said Laura Doyle, a Carrick resident and volunteer in the neighborhood.&nbsp;“No money is coming to my park, and there are serious needs. ... I don’t have a problem [with the tax]. I’ll pay my fair share. I just want to see my community benefit.”</p>
<p>Forty-two speakers — a majority from Councilman Anthony Coghill’s district — shared with council an assortment of concerns, including skepticism over the nonprofit Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy’s roughly $800,000 campaign to support the November ballot referendum. On the hearing agenda were two bills: a formality-type ordinance to create the tax, and a contentious bill on how to use the tax revenue.</p>
<p>Patrick Gianella, of Mount Washington, criticized Mayor Bill Peduto, who supported the conservancy’s efforts. Mr. Gianella called the tax referendum a&nbsp;“sneaky backdoor home rule charter change. Jim Boland, of Carrick, said the administration&nbsp;“didn’t have a backbone to introduce their own [tax increase].”</p>
<p>Voters approved the parks tax ballot referendum by a narrow margin in November. Property owners will now pay an additional $50 on every $100,000 of assessed real estate value to fund the city’s 165 parks.</p>
<p>The tax increase is expected to pull in an additional $10 million annually and matching private funds are promised in the charter’s new language.</p>
<p>Eight council members were present, some for only a portion of the meeting. Councilman Ricky Burgess, who introduced a third and separate bill relating to the parks tax revenue, was absent due to another commitment.</p>
<p>Former Councilwoman Darlene Harris was met with smiles and waves from some audience members. She registered public comment, urging her former colleagues to use their final voting power to wholesale reject the tax increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If I was on council only three months, I sure wouldn’t be voting on a tax increase,” she said, directing her comments to current District 1 representative Bobby Wilson.</p>
<p>Councilman Bruce Kraus, at the end of the hearing, said that the idea to&nbsp;“in any way undo the referendum” would set a&nbsp;“terrible precedent.”</p>
<p>Other members said they are hearing pain from District 4 and District 1, but&nbsp;“ultimately dividing it up equally would be shooting yourself in the foot,” said Councilwoman Strassburger, who said her neighborhoods, including Shadyside and Squirrel Hill, do not need the funds as badly as other districts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Mr. Coghill answered her plea with his own idiom.</p>
<p>“I’ve said that often [that] we have bigger needs, I feel, than probably a lot of the other districts. ... I am fighting for an equal distribution,” he said. “I ask that you respect our wishes. ... There’s an old saying, ‘one in the hand is better than two in the bush.’”</p>
<p>Roughly a dozen residents spoke in favor of the tax and of dividing the money according to need as opposed to district.</p>
<p>Zinna Scott, of Homewood, said that while several who spoke before her commented on poor park bathroom conditions or portable toilets, her neighborhood’s parks&nbsp;“don’t have bathrooms to [be] improved.”</p>
<p>“Three of our parks are on the top of that [Parks Conservancy priority] list, and that’s because the city hasn’t done anything for us, and that’s a real issue,” she said.&nbsp; “Racism in this city is alive and well.”</p>
<p>Brenda Smith, of the Nine Mile Run Watershed Association, said she found it&nbsp;“distressing to hear the rancor and suspicion” of the Parks Conservancy’s agenda and praised their&nbsp;“very detailed rubric of how to prioritize the [parks’] needs.”</p>
<p>But “no matter how wonderful we think the people who work [at the conservancy] are today, it’s still not a public body,” said Councilwoman Deb Gross, advocating to keep the financial decisions in council’s hands.</p>
<p>Council President Theresa Kail-Smith, who opposed the referendum, said that she wants to see all nine members&nbsp;“sticking together.” She said council is expected to bring the plan back to the table in two weeks.</p>
<p>No representatives from the Parks Conservancy spoke.</p>
<p>The conservancy declined to comment following the hearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto’s office did not have comment following the hearing.</p>
