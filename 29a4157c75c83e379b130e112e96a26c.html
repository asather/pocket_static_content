<h1>Analysis: Mike Sullivan makes the right call by showing 'faith' in embattled Penguins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If Mike Sullivan at any point over the last two days tuned into Pittsburgh sports talk radio, took advantage of <a href="https://my.post-gazette.com/purchase/" target="_blank">his Post-Gazette digital subscription</a> or logged into his burner Twitter account, he would have been bombarded with enough lineup suggestions to make his smartphone start smoking in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>Play Patric Hornqvist all 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Stick Jack Johnson on the 30th pair.</p>
<p>Start Tristan Jarry. Or Casey DeSmith. Or Emil Larmi. Anyone not named Matt.</p>
<p>And is there still a way to reacquire Carl Hagelin, Nick Bonino and Phil Kessel?</p>
<p>The Penguins gave away Game 1 of their five-game series against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday, going 1-for-7 on the power play, wasting a penalty shot and putting just two of 41 shots past Carey Price in a 3-2 overtime loss. There was no doubt they were the better team, though. Price made the difference.</p>
<p>Back in Pittsburgh, the people demanded changes to the lineup that Sullivan spent, like, literally four months thinking about. But up there in the Toronto bubble, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/08/02/Pittsburgh-Penguins-Montreal-Canadiens-Carey-Price-Mike-Sullivan-Brian-Dumoulin/stories/202008020163" target="_blank">the Penguins coach struck a positive tone</a>, both with his players and the media. He backed it up Monday by running back the same lines, defensive pairs and goalie.</p>
<p>The result was an imperfect performance but a reassuring 3-1 victory that evened the five-game qualifying-round series with the Canadiens at one win apiece.</p>
<p>After the game, Sullivan said he wasn’t trying to send a message to his players by keeping the lineup intact. But what came across to them was unmistakable.</p>
<p>“It shows a lot of faith,” John Marino said.</p>
<p>In Game 1, the fourth line was on the ice for two Canadiens goals, including the overtime winner. In Game 2, Teddy Blueger was on the ice in the final minute, asked to take the biggest faceoff of his young NHL career. He won it clean from Phillip Danault, the Penguins cleared and Jake Guentzel hit an empty net.</p>
<p>In Game 1, Jack Johnson essentially checked the first Canadiens goal into his own net and was caught in the corner when Jeff Petry scored in overtime. In Game 2, he remained in over Juuso Riikola and Chad Ruhwedel and was not on the ice for a single high-danger chance against during 5-on-5 play, per Natural Stat Trick.</p>
<p>In Game 1, Matt Murray whiffed on a Nick Suzuki shot that the other goalie might have grabbed with his glove and kicked out rebounds like a basketball backboard at your local playground. In Game 2, Murray went save for save with Price.</p>
<p>In terms of redemption, the list continued. Conor Sheary <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/08/03/Stick-taps-chirps-and-observations-from-Penguins-Canadiens-Game-2/stories/202008030127" target="_blank">setting up Jason Zucker for the game-winner</a>. The third line stabilizing. Brian Dumoulin bouncing back.</p>
<p>Add it all up, and the Penguins gutted out a narrow win to avoid a 2-0 deficit.</p>
<p>“We believe in the group that we have and we felt as though in Game 1 there was a whole lot to like about the game that we played,” Sullivan said. “You can’t always control whether or not the puck goes in the net. There were some areas where we knew we needed to get better and try to improve and we addressed those.”</p>
<p>Keeping Sidney Crosby in the lineup proved to be a savvy decision, too.</p>
<p>He gave the Penguins the lead 4:25 into the game. He took a hit to clear the zone, bounced off the boards then beat Joel Armia up the ice. As Guentzel pulled up inside the Montreal zone and turned back toward the boards, a pair of Canadiens drifted toward Sheary. Might want to cover Crosby next time, fellas.</p>
<p>Guentzel displayed great vision by flipping a cross-ice pass to a streaking Crosby. In all alone, Crosby froze Price with a flick of his stick then quickly fired five-hole. The goal looked a lot like his shootout winner in the 2008 Winter Classic.</p>
<p>Sullivan said it was “core” veterans like Crosby who set the tone between Game 1 and Game 2 at Toronto’s Scotiabank Arena, the Eastern Conference hub.</p>
<p>“You have to have a short memory. You have to learn from the experiences but you can’t dwell on them,” he said. “This core does a real good job of that.”</p>
<p>That core, at least for now, includes Murray. Sullivan stuck with the goalie who twice helped him hoist the Cup. Had Murray struggled, the coach might have had to turn to Jarry. In that event, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/04/13/pittsburgh-penguins-goalies-matt-murray-tristan-jarry-nhl-offseason-trade-rumors-jim-rutherford/stories/202004130060" target="_blank">with an uncertain offseason looming</a>, there’d have been a non-zero chance it was Murray’s last game in black and gold.</p>
<p>But he stopped 26 shots to earn his first playoff win in more than two years.</p>
<p>He wasn’t tested until early in the second period, when he snagged Armia’s tip-in try then moments later fought off with his blocker or paddle an against-the-grain shot from Tomas Tatar on an odd-man rush. He stuffed Tatar on a 2-on-1 on the first shift of the third, too. It was the first of his 13 saves in the final frame.</p>
<p>Murray was better positionally than in Game 1, as was his rebound control. The only goal he allowed came with 2:10 left, when Artturi Lehkonen’s shot changed course on the way to Murray and kicked off his pad to Jesperi Kotkaniemi.</p>
<p>From there, the Penguins locked it down and essentially iced out a win.</p>
<p>“We felt pretty good about our game. We were generating good chances,” Crosby said. “They still had that push. They still had a few chances. [Murray] had to make some big saves, especially in the third there. You have to expect that. But for the most part I thought we did a pretty good job of playing the same way.”</p>
<p>Scanning the box score, you might think they played the same way on the power play, too. But the one significant personnel tweak that Sullivan did make resulted in a few flickers of hope, despite the Penguins going 0-for-5 on the night.</p>
<p>Armia took three of those Canadiens penalties. When the game ended, the big winger was seen Googling how to get his mail forwarded to the penalty box.</p>
<p>Hornqvist, who <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/08/01/penguins-canadiens-game-1-recap-overtime-penalty-shots/stories/202008010068" target="_blank">surprisingly was a bystander on special teams</a> during Saturday’s loss, was back on the top unit Monday. He did his usual break-dancing routine just outside the crease. Had he done the “Running Man” or “The Worm” one more time he may have gotten a goalie stick snapped over his head.</p>
<p>That net-front mayhem gave the top unit life and a little more space. If not for Price, the Penguins would have scored on their first and third power plays.</p>
<p>The Penguins still need work when it comes to breakouts and zone entries on the power play. But Sullivan thought they did a “much better job” when they did get set up. They fired 14 shots on those five power plays, including a brief 5-on-3.</p>
<p>“They had some real good looks,” Sullivan said. “There were a lot of pucks lying around the crease that we couldn’t get to. Some of the ones we could get to, Price made some big saves on them. … The power play was much improved.”</p>
<p>Game 3 of the qualifying-round series is scheduled for 8 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gonna go out on a limb here and predict that we see this lineup again.</p>
