<h1>Charleroi schools addresses students fighting on Instagram</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Instagram account that was apparently created to display videos of fights between Charleroi School District students has been taken down and the students responsible have been disciplined, the district’s superintendent said.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.charleroisd.org/" target="_blank">In a letter posted to the district’s website Thursday</a>, Superintendent Edward Zelich said the account was created just one day earlier but included videos from incidents that, in some cases, happened weeks or months ago. Zelich also said the district had worked&nbsp;“intently” since Wednesday to determine who was responsible for the account and to get it taken down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This afternoon, we were able to determine who was responsible for the Instagram page; the page has now been deleted and the videos are no longer available to be seen,” Mr. Zelich said in the statement. “While we cannot explain student discipline issues further than that, we can assure you that all appropriate steps to investigate and stop this matter were taken immediately.”</p>
<p>Mr. Zelich also said the fights displayed were known to district officials, and that the students involved had already been disciplined for their conduct.</p>
<p>Charleroi students, parents and community members can anonymously report incidents of violence or other problems at the district’s Safe2Say hotline, Mr. Zelich said. It can be reached at&nbsp;1-844-SAF2SAY, or online at <a href="http://www.safe2saypa.org" target="_blank">www.safe2saypa.org</a>.</p>
<p>“The most preventive measure our learning community can employ is to obtain information about potential threats before an individual decides or begins to take action,” Mr. Zelich said. “We continue to encourage and ask our students, staff, and community for their support by reporting concerns to an administrator or through our Safe2Say School Hotline.”</p>
