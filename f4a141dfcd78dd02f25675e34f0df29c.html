<h1>Judge's ruling could mean extra food assistance </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A federal judge's order Friday could mean hundreds of thousands of the most low-income Pennsylvanians would be able to receive additional pandemic-related government food assistance benefits.</p>
<p>The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, passed in March, aimed to give emergency extra food stamps during the pandemic and economic fallout resulting from pandemic-induced closures. However, a lawsuit alleges the U.S. Department of Agriculture — by capping the benefits low-income people can receive — is not correctly interpreting the law.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania had asked the federal government for permission to give food stamp recipients additional benefits, but that was denied by the USDA, the federal agency that oversees the program. The agency is only allowing the extra aid to bring food stamp recipients up to the maximum benefit amount, while the lowest-income people — who were already receiving the maximum benefit due to their low incomes — are receiving no additional aid.</p>
<p>But a preliminary injunction Friday by Judge John Milton Younge, of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, would stop the USDA from denying the emergency benefits while the lawsuit continues through the courts. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/07/17/Lawsuit-says-federal-agency-is-wrongly-denying-emergency-food-stamps-to-poor-Pennsylvanians/stories/202007170086" target="_blank">The lawsuit was filed in July in Pennsylvania; one plaintiff lives in Pittsburgh and one in Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>“Nearly 40% of Pennsylvania SNAP households, including many elderly people, families with young children, and people with disabilities, currently receive no emergency SNAP at all due to the USDA’s violation of the law,” attorneys for the plaintiffs said when the lawsuit was filed, referring to the food stamp program by its formal name, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</p>
<p>More than 1.9 million Pennsylvanians are currently enrolled in SNAP, a number that's increased by about 101,500 people since February, according to state statistics.</p>
<p>The litigation was filed by Community Legal Services of Philadelphia and law firm Morgan Lewis on behalf of plaintiffs Latoya Gilliam, of Philadelphia, and Kayla McCrobie, of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Neither state nor USDA officials could be immediately reached for comment Friday.</p>
<p>“As the Court recognized, our clients – individuals and families struggling to access nutritious&nbsp;food during an unprecedented global crisis – need emergency SNAP benefits to get by during the&nbsp;pandemic,” Louise Hayes, supervising attorney at Community Legal Services, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Even in normal times, SNAP benefits are too low to meet families’ food needs, and&nbsp;they are even less adequate during a pandemic that has raised food prices and limited food&nbsp;access. This affects everyone, especially those with the lowest incomes.&nbsp;USDA’s mistaken guidance put a nonsensical cap on emergency allotments. Under the USDA’s&nbsp;interpretation of the [Families First Coronavirus Response Act], the poorest SNAP recipients got no help during the pandemic, while&nbsp;the least-poor SNAP recipients received the most help. The Court agreed with us that this&nbsp;exclusion of the poorest households from emergency help cannot have been what Congress&nbsp;intended.”</p>
