<h1>Like other races, 2020 Liberty Mile is going virtual</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Liberty Mile is the Pittsburgh running community’s latest race to shift formats.</p>
<p>Organizers for Pittsburgh Three Rivers Marathon, Inc., which oversees the race,&nbsp;announced Thursday that the 1-mile event scheduled for July 24 in Downtown Pittsburgh has been nixed in favor of a virtual offering due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;Competitors can complete the distance anywhere and at their own pace.</p>
<p>Those who participate will receive a race medal and shirt. P3R organizers will also sponsor contests and activities related to the event via email and social media.</p>
<p>“While we will miss the runners in downtown this year, we are excited to see them complete their Fleet Feet Liberty Mile from all across the country,” said Troy Schooley, P3R CEO. “Whether you’re running your very first mile, trying to set a personal record, or plan to cross your own special finish line as a family — we invite you to be part of this year’s Fleet Feet Liberty Mile.”</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Marathon, another P3R race, was completed virtually earlier this month, and organizers for the Great Race announced last week that they would follow that model for their September event as well.</p>
