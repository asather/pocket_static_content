<h1>Report: MLB considering proposal for drastically shortened season, prorated player salaries</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It isn’t quite baseball yet, but in the constant push and pull of negotiations between MLB and the MLBPA over the past months, another step was taken Monday.</p>
<p>ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported that MLB is considering proposing a season of around 50 games, with the players receiving a full prorated salary for those games. This report comes just a day after the players proposed a 114-game schedule in which they would receive 70% of their salaries.</p>
<p>On the surface, it would be easy to view that 64-game gap between proposals as a big hurdle to overcome. Perhaps it is, but it is important to note that the prorated salary portion of this considered proposal is a large step in the right direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of the bickering between MLB and the players association has come over differing interpretations of the deal the two parties agreed to in March. The players believe that that agreement entitles them to prorated salaries no matter what the season looks like. The owners disputed that assertion.</p>
<p>However, the fact that owners are now willing to offer a prorated salary, even if it is for a very short season, seems like an olive branch of sorts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, prorated salaries over a 50- or 60-game season is still likely to be a no-go for the players, since it would mean the players would make less than a third of their usual salaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of Passan’s report includes the idea that MLB believes the March agreement gives them the power to determine the number of games in the season, given they pay a prorated salary.</p>
<p>The understanding seems to be that MLB doesn’t necessarily want to do that, instead hoping to continue to negotiate with players to find an amicable solution to this.</p>
<p>Now, baseball fans will have to continue to wait and see. The two sides are running out of time if they still hope to start their season around the beginning of July, as was previously reported, which means the wait to see what the season will look like may not be as long as one might think.</p>
<p>If this most recent news is any indication, the middle ground here may be a concession on either season length or salary.</p>
