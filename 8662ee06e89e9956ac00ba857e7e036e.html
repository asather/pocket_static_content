<h1>Rex Theater sells memorabilia to raise money for employees</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, Ben Penigar, founder of Grey Area Productions, was in The Rex Theater on the South Side packaging up about 50 pieces of memorabilia for shipping.</p>
<p>The items, mostly posters, some autographed, were from the personal collection he acquired over the last 11 years of his company booking the Rex.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Mr. Penigar was selling them, online via auction on Facebook, as a fundraiser to pay the theater’s 27 full- and part-time employees.</p>
<p>“We have at least 12 people that work each show,” he says. “More for high-risk shows.”</p>
<p>The Rex shut down due to the coronavirus threat during that second week of March, which would have climaxed on the St. Patrick’s Day Parade that Saturday with a big sold-out party by Bastard Bearded Irishmen.</p>
<p>“I am so thankful that we pulled the plug on those shows,” Mr. Penigar says.</p>
<p>Especially considering that one of the Rex employees has been suffering from COVID-19.</p>
<p>“He was being aided by a ventilator as of [Friday],” Mr. Penigar says. “Healthy, less than 35 years old, and in great shape when I saw him just last month at work. He has since been taken off of the ventilator and is showing signs of improvement. We are hopeful he will recover.”</p>
<p>The auction, which ended Sunday and raised $7,000, included tour posters of bands that have played the Rex, like Railroad Earth, Greensky Bluegrass, Turkuaz and Rubblebucket. The biggest seller was a Bootsy Collins-signed bass that went for $1,420.</p>
<p>The Rex is also doing limited edition REX T-shirts that benefit the employees of The Rex and CommonWealth Press, who will print and ship more shirts once they reopen. That effort has raised $11,000.</p>
<p>They’ve added $5,000 from the online merch store (<a href="/store.greyareaprod.com" target="_blank">store.greyareaprod.com</a>) and $3,000 in direct donations from friends, family, and fans, so the Rex Staff Relief Fund is at just over $20,000. They made a first round of disbursements of $500 each to Rex employees, and plan another later this week or next week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of now, all of the Rex shows are postponed through April and into May.</p>
<p>“No one has any real idea when things will go back to normal,” he says. “If everyone's finances have been drained, where does the money come from to spend on unnecessary purchases like concert tickets, dinners out, and drinks at shows?”</p>
<p>Mr. Penigar says the theater has filed for Small Business Association loans, but that “loans are not the answer. I don't need loans that I won't be able to repay. They're not a solution for businesses that already have tiny margins like mine. Over half of my 11 years have not been profitable. This could very possibly end my business, but my only concern right now is the wellbeing of our employees. I can get another job down the road, but these people need to feed their families now.”</p>
