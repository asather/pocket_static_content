<h1>Researchers studying a variety of COVID-19 treatments in the pipeline</h1>

<p>The puzzle continues over whether much-ballyhooed drugs actually work against COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine that President Donald Trump has lauded and, eventually, remdesivir, which has shown success against other RNA viruses.</p>
<p>But recent studies suggest there are other new and existing drugs and treatments with potential to battle SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, even if each also has its challenges.</p>
<p>Convalescent plasma, already proven helpful in treating Ebola, is antibody-rich blood plasma drawn from people who recovered from infection and used to boost the immune system of severely ill patients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now comes the FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug ivermectin that’s been shown in laboratory cultures to readily kill SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh and UPMC have launched their revolutionary UPMC-REMAP-COVID19 fast-track clinical trial, using multiple combinations of drugs, with ongoing results through artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The trial is unique in analyzing multiple drugs all at once while treating everyday patients rather than limiting treatment to selected participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within a matter of weeks or coming months, UPMC officials say, they hope to know which drug or&nbsp;drug cocktail best reduces the COVID-19 severity and death toll, with ever more patients receiving the better performing treatments as results become clearer.</p>
<p>For now, 100 clinical trials are underway worldwide to test COVID-19 treatments, said Dr. Derek Angus, a professor and chair of Pitt’s Department of Critical Care Medicine.</p>
<p>He was a key member of the team that developed the fast-track methodology for clinical trials after the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic hit with no available treatments.</p>
<p>During a Thursday news conference, he said other promising drugs, if not already scheduled for use in the UPMC-REMAP-COVID19 trial, could be rolled in later. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For nearly a century, the randomized clinical trial has served as the best scientific method to test drug safety and efficiency. But such trials typically&nbsp;take years to complete.</p>
<p>“We don’t have the luxury of time so we must learn while we’re doing it,” Dr. Angus said.</p>
<p><strong>Tonic water? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Quinine, a key component of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, is the flavoring in tonic water.</p>
<p>“Quinine is what’s in gin and tonic and has been used to treat malaria for 100 years,” Dr. Angus said.</p>
<p>In his commentary published March 30 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, he proclaimed the need “to&nbsp;throw out old ways of thinking and fuse clinical care and clinical research into one extremely efficient system.”</p>
<p>“The world faced a similar epidemic in 1918, and millions died. And now facing another, it is useful to reflect that physicians tried to treat the Spanish flu with quinine,” he said. “A century later it is shocking to still be asking the same question about the same drugs. An integrated approach of learning-while-doing is essential.</p>
<p>“This is an unprecedented pandemic and we need an unprecedented response,” he said.</p>

<p>Remdesivir, a drug developed to battle Ebola, MERS-CoV and the original SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 in China, could hold potential against COVID-19. But a&nbsp;UPMC spokeswoman said remdesivir won’t be included in UPMC’s initial drug treatment regimen but likely will be added later.</p>
<p>An Irish study published April 6 in the journal Cureus describes the “potent interference” that remdesivir causes a SARS-CoV-2 enzyme.</p>
<p>Eight clinical trials are underway in China, France and the United States, it said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Blood cure</strong></p>
<p>Other drugs that UPMC doctors said they’ll test include steroids and medications called immuno-modulators that alter immune-system response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two other treatments are drawing attention and for good reason. They are existing treatments now being tested against SARS-CoV-2 as potential treatments for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Convalescent plasma — what Dr. Angus called convalescent serum —&nbsp;works by providing a high volume of antibodies to severely ill patients, as though reinforcements appear from nowhere to boost the immune response and rout the virus.</p>
<p>The problem is, no pharmaceutical company is producing the serum.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about rolling it out — when we can get it,” he said.&nbsp;“As soon as there’s a product, that’s the perfect example of one that we’ll be rolling in” to the drug regimen used in the “learning-while-doing” trial.</p>
<p>There’s reason for excitement.</p>
<p>“Infectious diseases remain one of the top 10 global health threats as announced by the World Health Organization,” states a&nbsp;China-based study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences journal. “The emergence of new pathogens for which there is no effective treatment has redrawn the attention to the usefulness of convalescent plasma.”</p>
<p>The treatment “can be&nbsp;an alternate and fast therapeutic option in outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Chikungunya, Ebola and Zika.”</p>
<p>“This study showed [convalescent plasma] therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing [virus in the blood] in severe COVID-19 cases,” it said, noting, however, that “[t]he optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of [convalescent plasma] therapy,&nbsp;needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.”</p>
<p><strong>Lice and COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>The drug ivermectin has been available since the 1970s&nbsp;to treat lice and scabies, among other parasitic infections in animals and humans and already is FDA approved.</p>
<p>But it has yet to undergo a randomized clinical trial to test for safety and efficacy in treating COVID-19, with some suggesting that significantly higher doses than those used against parasites would be necessary.</p>
<p>Still, an Australian study says it has potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ultimately, development of an effective anti-viral for SARS-CoV-2, if given to patients early in infection, could help to limit the viral load, prevent severe disease progression and limit person-person transmission,” according to the study recently published online in the Antiviral Research journal.</p>
<p>“Bench-marking testing of ivermectin against other potential antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 with alternative mechanisms of action would thus be important as soon as practicable,” it says.</p>
<p>The report “raises the possibility that ivermectin could be a useful antiviral to limit SARS-CoV-2, in similar fashion to those already reported,” it says, noting that “until one of these is proven to be beneficial in a clinical setting, all should be pursued as rapidly as possible.”</p>
<p>A 2011 report published in the Proceedings of the Japan Academy says ivermectin, developed in the 1970s in Kitasato Institute in Tokyo, has benefited billions of humans worldwide, which parallels the benefits of penicillin and aspirin.</p>
<p>Originally a veterinary drug, it is used regularly against multiple parasitic infections with its grandest success in eradicating river blindness, caused by repeated black-fly bites and leading to itching, rashes and skin damage.</p>
<p>The report even says ivermectin’s success in treating livestock, pets and humans “has led many to describe it as a wonder drug.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Caution required</strong></p>
<p>“There are many such studies underway currently throughout the world. We urge extreme caution in interpreting or promoting these studies done in the laboratory in cells. Right now, the data we have is very limited.”</p>
<p>So says Dr.&nbsp;Gavin Harris, a UPMC infectious disease expert, noting&nbsp;“extremely limited clinical data” concerning ivermectin’s effects against SARs-CoV-2. In addition there are no clinical trial results showing its impact on COVID-19</p>
<p>“Everything is very observational at this point,” he said. “Extrapolating data from experiments in cells directly to humans can be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>“Without true randomized, controlled trials, results achieved in the laboratory can be relatively meaningless,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Tom Walsh, an Allegheny Health Network infectious disease specialist, said he and colleagues are&nbsp;“very closely monitoring all available literature and carefully weighing all data” used in AHN treatment procedures for COVID-19.</p>
<p>“There are currently more than two dozen potential therapeutics that are being investigated, and we are considering all of the pertinent data for each of these,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivermectin, he said, can inhibit in a laboratory setting the replication of several RNA viruses in lab cultures, with 50% inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication over a period of two days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the maximum dose of ivermectin produces concentration levels that are 50 times less than what the Australian study showed to be necessary to reduce viral replication by half.</p>
<p>For now, available data doesn’t support widespread use of ivermectin in treating COVID-19, Dr. Walsh said, “but it creaks open the door to consider further investigation.”</p>
<p>Dr. Harris from UPMC also recommended caution in assuring that “we have sound clinical science driving treatment.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, like in the Ebola Crisis in 2014,” he said, “we will be left without sound results and guidance for future events.”&nbsp;</p>
