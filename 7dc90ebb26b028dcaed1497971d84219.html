<p>LOS ANGELES — Kobe Bryant and the rest of the stellar 2020 Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame class will have to wait for enshrinement, with the ceremony set to be postponed until early 2021.</p>
<p>Hall of Fame chairman Jerry Colangelo said the announcement won’t be formalized until a June 10 board meeting, but the postponement because of the coronavirus pandemic “appears certain.”</p>
<p>Bryant, who died in January, was set to headline a Hall of Fame class alongside Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett. The ceremony was originally scheduled for Aug 29.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Colangelo said the Hall would “follow the leader” when it comes to the NBA’s scheduling calendar in scheduling a new date.</p>
<p>“It’s dominoes,” he said. “When does the NBA resume? When does it end? When does the new season begin? When does that end?</p>
<p>“There are so many ramifications.”</p>
<p>Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan and five others all got into the Hall in their first year as finalists, as did WNBA great Tamika Catchings.</p>
<p>The other members of the Class of 2020 were two-time NBA champion coach Rudy Tomjanovich, longtime Baylor women’s coach Kim Mulkey, 1,000-game winner Barbara Stevens of Bentley and three-time Final Four coach Eddie Sutton — who died this past weekend.</p>
