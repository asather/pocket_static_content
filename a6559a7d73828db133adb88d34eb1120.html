<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Seven alleged drug dealers have been charged with transporting cocaine and methamphetamine from Philadelphia to Indiana County following a federal wiretap investigation.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office said Tuesday that the seven are named in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court, although it had yet to be placed on the public docket.</p>
<p>The defendants are Jelahn Williams, 35, Malik Byers, 28, Dayton Melton, 22, all of Philadelphia, along with Ahmed Doumbia, 26, Romello Johnson-Holland, 24, and Tamir Washington-Jenkins, 23, all of Indiana. A seventh defendant, Isaiah Daniels-Wheeler, 24, is from Elkins Park, Pa.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Scott Brady and the district attorney in Indiana County, Bob Manzi, said in a statement that the arrests were part of a joint federal-state effort to disrupt drug traffickers preying on communities Indiana County.</p>
<p>Agents and police said that the alleged dealers conspired to transport crack cocaine from Philadelphia from Jan. 7 to April 18.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams, Mr. Byers and Mr. Doumbia made multiple trips from Indiana to Philadelphia to buy crack from Mr. Melton and Mr. Daniels-Wheeler and others and drove it back to stash locations in Indiana, including an apartment rented by Mr. Johnson-Holland, according to a complaint. The crack was then distributed to customers and street-level dealers.</p>
<p>In a separate complaint, agents and police said they completed a controlled buy of meth from Mr. Washington-Jenkins on Oct. 10 in which he provided the 54 grams of the drug to a confidential source in exchange for $1,600.</p>
