<h1>'Are we going to know?' Pat Narduzzi worried about COVID-19 testing turnaround</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pat Narduzzi joked (or maybe half-joked) Thursday afternoon that he would say a couple rosaries later that night. And no, it’s not Austin Peay’s triple-option offense that has him praying.</p>
<p>Pitt is set to complete its third and final round of weekly COVID-19 testing Friday afternoon ahead of its season opener at 4 p.m. Saturday at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>The Panthers “feel good” about where they’re at after Sunday’s testing, the first session of the week. Narduzzi declined to disclose any data, in keeping with how Pitt’s athletic department has handled the virus since athletes returned to campus.</p>
<p>Narduzzi also said he isn’t sure if and when Pitt would acknowledge publicly — with a short statement or otherwise — the players who might miss Saturday’s game due to COVID-19. A Pitt spokesman said the ACC does not have a uniform policy on announcing non-participants due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>But when speaking to reporters Thursday afternoon, Narduzzi did reveal something: He had yet to receive results from Wednesday’s testing. So naturally, Narduzzi, a self-proclaimed “worrywart” still in the dark about the status of his players, expressed concern over Friday’s testing that will take place 26 to 28 hours before kickoff.</p>
<p>“If we test on Friday and we have a 4 o’clock game ... are we going to know? I don’t like it at all,” Narduzzi said. “We need some rapid testing. It has to happen quicker. There are going to be some anxious players. And I don’t think it’s good for anybody. I’m going to have an ulcer after game two.”</p>
<p>If Friday’s results aren’t turned around faster than Sunday and Wednesday’s, the stress will mount sooner than that.</p>
<p>The Panthers are undergoing PCR nasal swab tests for COVID-19 three times a week, per a recent ACC mandate. The Sunday and Wednesday tests are handled by BioReference Laboratories in New Jersey — a decision made by Pitt athletics, partnering with the same company the Steelers are using. Meanwhile, Friday’s testing is administered by the ACC, with the conference employing MAKO Medical, a lab in North Carolina.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the team had to test before 11 a.m. in order for BioReference’s labs to receive them the day of, which didn’t happen. Narduzzi said he didn’t want to alter his players’ schedule and have them come to the South Side facility earlier than usual. So testing occurred later Sunday, the tests didn’t arrive in New Jersey until Monday and Pitt received its results Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Panthers tested earlier. Narduzzi was first in the door, getting tested at 6:30 a.m. His assistant coaches and staffers were tested within the next half hour, while players were tested between 7 and 8 a.m. before practice. While offensive players met with their position coaches, defensive players were tested, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Friday, though, will be different. Between noon and 2 p.m., the Panthers will basically be tested twice. Narduzzi said MAKO Medical staffers will go up the left and right nostril with one nasal swab, put it in a vile, close it up and then repeat the process.</p>
<p>If a team member’s initial test turns up positive, the North Carolina lab will test the second swab. Should the second swab come back positive, the player is ruled out. If the second swab comes back negative, MAKO Medical will deem the first test a false positive, allowing the team member to participate on game day, Narduzzi said.</p>
<p>Austin Peay’s players will undergo the same testing in a hangar at Pittsburgh International Airport when they arrive Friday. Both teams’ tests will then be sent down to North Carolina.</p>
<p>“I hope that plane doesn’t get delayed. Otherwise, it could delay the results even more,” Narduzzi said. “We’ll get a GA to drive those things down if we have to.”</p>
<p>Anything to avoid an early-season ulcer — or worse, Saturday’s game being delayed.</p>
<p>“I’m sure ESPN or the ACC Network would love that,” Narduzzi said Thursday. “We can’t put anybody out there that’s going to risk anyone else’s health. Player safety’s got to be the key. ... But again, this is uncharted territory.”</p>
<p>“These are anxious moments for these poor kids. It’s hard. Three times a week they’re waiting to see if they’re good. It’s not easy.”</p>
