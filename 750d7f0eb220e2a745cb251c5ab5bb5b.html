<h1>In times of crisis is when America makes its biggest mistakes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One by one, the man who’s poured decades into constitutional law rattled off a litany of what he considers to be some of America’s most notorious civil liberty violations.</p>
<p>The first dated back to World War II, when the Supreme Court upheld President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s decision to move thousands of Japanese-Americans from the West Coast into internment camps in the middle of the U.S., out of fear that some of them could be saboteurs.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Then, there was the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, when the National Security Agency —&nbsp;with the authorization of President George W. Bush —&nbsp;secretly intercepted the calls and emails of American citizens communicating with people abroad and the U.S. government picked up alleged enemy combatants from the battlefield of Afghanistan, some of whom were U.S. citizens, and held them in military custody on American soil without allowing them basic rights.</p>
<p>It just goes to show — said Duquesne University President Ken Gormley —&nbsp;that during times of crises are when America makes its biggest mistakes.</p>
<p>Now, as America finds itself in the midst of another crisis in which millions of citizens are facing governmental restrictions on their travel, their work and their ability to congregate, U.S. policymakers and public officials are having to walk a thin constitutional tightrope between protecting the rights of citizens and protecting the public from the spread of COVID-19, Mr. Gormley said.</p>
<p>“You’d be hard pressed to find any constitutional experts who say that COVID-19 isn’t a real crisis,” Mr. Gormley said this past week. “The question becomes, what steps are necessary and warranted to deal with it? What rights — to take care of this crisis — might legitimately have to give way, and for how long?”</p>
<p>Rights under the constitution have never been absolute, Mr. Gormley noted, and it has been well established that the government can’t possibly be expected to protect its citizenry without curtailing freedoms at certain times.</p>
<p>More than a century ago, the Supreme Court upheld Massachusetts’ right to require all residents to get a vaccine for smallpox, even though the plaintiff had a fear of needles and thought the state was overreaching.</p>
<p>“It’s what we call in constitutional law ‘police powers,’” Mr. Gormley said. “It’s [the government’s] power to ensure the health, safety and welfare of its broader citizenry.”</p>
<p>Though state, local and federal governments have enhanced powers to restrict the citizens for their collective good, they can’t single out certain individuals or businesses for harsher treatment, Mr. Gormley said — adding that he hasn’t yet seen that in the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>But overreach is possible, he warned, and as Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson wrote in 1952 — responding to President Harry Truman’s invoking of emergency powers in his administration’s seizure of steel mills — “Emergency powers can beget emergencies.”</p>
<p>To ensure that the response to the virus is proportional, governmental bodies must put appropriate deadlines on restrictions to rights, then continue to re-evaluate their measures with input from the community, Mr. Gormley said. So far, Gov. Tom Wolf, Mayor Bill Peduto and County Executive Rich Fitzgerald have been “extremely deliberative” and “extremely collaborative” at every stage, he insisted.</p>
<p>Decisionmakers, so far, have acted within their power, he said. State and local authorities are the first responders, while Congress and President Donald Trump largely facilitate and support the work of state and local bodies.</p>
<p>Congress can exercise its power by passing relief packages, which it’s done, while the president is tasked with serving as a symbolic leader and unifying the country around a common vision, Mr. Gormley said.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump does have the power to invoke the Defense Production Act, a power granted to presidents by Congress that would allow him to mandate that companies produce essential supplies like ventilators, face masks and protective equipment.</p>
<p>But if Mr. Trump were to try to order a national lockdown or a widespread quarantine, it wouldn’t be enforceable, Mr. Gormley said.</p>
<p>“The extent to which the president can snap his fingers and start running the whole country as if it’s a battlefield, I just don’t see that anywhere in the Constitution,” Mr. Gormley said.</p>
<p>“But I don’t see that the Trump administration has been trying to do that,” he added.</p>
<p>Mr. Gormley said he’d be concerned if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to take on enhanced powers, perhaps to detain individuals. He said that would cross a line.</p>
<p><strong>Smartphones as bracelets</strong></p>
<p>What is likely to happen, he said, is that citizens’ right to privacy could be tested during this crisis.</p>
<p>Governments in China, South Korea and Italy have started to collect data on their citizens more aggressively to deal with the epidemic, Mr. Gormley noted — in some cases, by analyzing smartphone data to see if people are really sheltering at home.</p>
<p>Addressing reports that the Trump administration is consulting with tech companies about using cell location data to help with their surveillance of public health, Mr. Gormley said he doesn’t think the government has the inherit right to be able to use data in that fashion.</p>
<p>“I don’t think any of us, in buying a smartphone or buying one for our kids, intend for it to be used like a bracelet monitor that would be put on prisoners on house arrest,” Mr. Gormley said, noting that a measure like that would usually require a warrant and Fourth Amendment protections.</p>
<p>“Could they get away with it if things got very severe and if there was some sort of lockdown in the country that required very firm measures? The reality is, they probably could get away with it, at least for a limited time” he added.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>Mr. Gormley said he doesn’t see any of these extreme overreaches yet, and commended public officials for reacting in a “measured” fashion that has been proportional to the emergency at hand. But the longer the pandemic continues, the more challenges there will be to authority, he anticipates — especially because the federal government’s response was “sluggish” to start, a flaw that could facilitate a piecemeal, day-to-day strategy.</p>
<p>The public will have to sound the alarm if they see excesses, Mr. Gormley said, and in most cases, issues of overreach aren’t addressed until after the crisis is over.</p>
<p>“In the end, no one likes, as long as this goes on, to be told they can’t keep working and making money because it could destroy them in a different way.” Mr. Gormley said. “The longer this goes on, [the more] I think we’ll see challenges to the power and authority of different branches.”</p>
