<h1>City, union reach 5-year agreement for Citiparks employees, park rangers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The city of Pittsburgh has reached a five-year agreement with its unionized parks employees, including its park rangers that work within the Department of Public Safety.</p>
<p>The roughly 60 employees, represented by the Service Employees International Union Local 668, will now receive paid parental leave; paid “safe” leave in the case of domestic violence; the ability to donate paid time off to co-workers for medical reasons; and a salary increase&nbsp;“in line with compensation offered by peer cities that support family sustaining wages for the city's workforce,” according to the city’s Monday announcement.</p>
<p>The Citiparks employees include senior and community recreation center directors, program coordinators, the Schenley Rink leader, recreation leaders&nbsp;and park rangers.</p>
<p>The contract, signed with the union,&nbsp;“changed all gendered pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers) to gender neutral pronouns (they/them/theirs) in an effort to be more inclusive for all gender identities,” according to the city.</p>
<p>The agreement term is from January 2020 through December 2024.</p>
<p>SEIU Local 668 could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
