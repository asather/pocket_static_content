<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Derry woman was killed after a man fired into the wrong house in a retaliatory shooting over a botched drug transaction.</p>
<p>Police on Thursday arrested Nathan Quidetto, 20, of&nbsp;Latrobe, and charged him with homicide in the death of Tracy Marie Squib, a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/07/20/Westmoreland-County-woman-killed-homicide-derry-township-chest-wound-Tracy-Squib/stories/202007200104" target="_blank">52-year-old teacher</a> at&nbsp;Grace Bible Church in Derry.</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint, Mr. Quidetto told police that he drove a friend’s car to Ms. Squib’s house on Pandora Road on Monday. He stopped in front of the residence, exited the car and fired multiple shots in the direction of Ms. Squib’s residence.</p>
<p>He got back into the vehicle and drove back to his friend’s house, the complaint reads. Mr. Quidetto told police that he fired into the home as revenge for a drug transaction gone wrong, but the intended target does not live at the Squib residence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“No members of the Squib family were identified by Quidetto as being involved in said transaction,” Pennsylvania State Trooper Paige Shreffler wrote in the criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Court records did not list a lawyer for Mr. Quidetto.</p>
<p>Ms. Squib was asleep in bed with her husband when a bullet entered the residence and hit her, police said. She told her husband that she thought she was bitten by something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorities transported Ms. Squib to Latrobe Hospital, where she was pronounced deceased just before 5 a.m. Monday morning. The cause was determined to be a gunshot wound to the upper chest.</p>
<p>Police discovered multiple bullet holes on the outside of the Squib home in the area of Ms. Squib’s bedroom, the complaint reads.</p>
<p>She and her husband had two children, who also were in the home during the shooting.</p>
<p>PA Crime Stoppers&nbsp;on Wednesday put out a <a href="https://www.crimewatchpa.com/crimestoppers/316/cases/10000-reward-shooting-kills-one-derry-township-westmoreland-county-do-you-know-anything-we" target="_blank">$10,000 reward</a> for information on the killing.</p>
<p>In addition to homicide, Mr. Quidetto is facing three counts of recklessly endangering another person, four felony counts of discharging a firearm into an occupied structure and a felony charge of carrying a firearm without a licence.</p>
