<h1>Pirates shut down Steven Brault due to left shoulder muscle strain</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>DUNEDIN, Fla. — The Pirates received some bad news before Monday’s game against the Toronto Blue Jays at TD Ballpark as Steven Brault’s battle for the fifth starter role hit a snag.</p>
<p>Brault was shut down from throwing with a left shoulder muscle strain. He last pitched on Friday against the Orioles at LECOM Park, when he allowed two runs on four hits.</p>
<p>Brault also posted three strikeouts in the game. He will remain with the team during his rehab progression and will be re-assessed by the Pirates in two weeks to determine his throwing status.</p>
<p>Brault’s injury and rehab could clear a path for Derek Holland to make the opening day roster as the fifth starter. Holland, whom the Pirates signed in late January, has seven strikeouts in 4⅓ innings this spring.</p>
<p>It’s the second announced injury to a Pirates pitcher since the weekend. As manager Derek Shelton revealed Sunday,&nbsp;Clay Holmes will be in a walking boot for about four to six weeks. Minnesota’s Nelson Cruz hit a groundball that bounced off Holmes’ right foot on Saturday. Holmes pitched scoreless innings in his first two outings before the Cruz at-bat.</p>
<p>It’s a tough break for Holmes, who was looking to compete for a spot in an already tight bullpen. Holmes is one of the four right-handers who are out of minor league options.</p>
<p>If there is a positive for Holmes, it’s that his injury will delay the Pirates having to decide on keeping him or designating him for assignment. The team won’t have to worry about keeping him on the roster until he’s been activated from the injured list.</p>
<p><strong>Pitcher Koehler retires</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re Michael Jordan or if your athletic glory days were in the fifth-grade tiddlywink tournament. There will come a day when your body betrays you to the point of no return. Your mind and spirit may still be willing, but you know your body can’t perform at the highest level anymore.</p>
<p>That day came Monday for Tom Koehler. The 33-year-old right-hander anticipated eventually competing for a spot on the Pirates but has decided to retire.</p>
<p>“There comes a time when you realize that you’ve pushed it as hard as you can. Two years ago today was the initial injury date,” Koehler told reporters at LECOM Park in reference to a right anterior capsule sprain of the shoulder. “I tried pushing through. I tried throwing bullpens. I threw a sim game yesterday that was kind of my last test.</p>
<p>“I was either going to get through it and pitch like I wanted to throw or I was going to push it to a point where my arm no longer could reach that point. Now it’s time to move on and figure out what that next chapter is for me in the game.&nbsp;The surgery I had doesn’t come with a huge success rate. There aren’t a lot of people that I can call who’ve had the surgery to tell me what it would be like. It’s not like it’s a Tommy John where people have it and bounce back. It was always going to be tough.”</p>
<p>Koehler was making steady progress during camp. Unfortunately for him, the good times were short-lived.</p>
<p>“It’s tough because when I came to spring, I felt great. My first two bullpens felt great,” Koehler said. “You can talk to the pitching coaches they were like ‘OK, the guy is back. This is the guy we signed.’ But once I threw the first live BP, things went in the opposite direction. It’s tough to be a pitcher when you can’t throw the ball. Unfortunately, that’s where I’m at now. I don’t have the energy to get caught into the rehab process anymore.”</p>
<p>Koehler ends his career with a 4.39 ERA in 161 games (133 starts) between 2012-17 for the Marlins and Toronto Blue Jays. Koehler had a 36-55 record with 6.9 strikeouts per nine innings and 1.39 walks and hits per inning in his career. His season-low ERA was 4.08 in 2015.</p>
<p>He wants to remain in baseball and is open to front office and coaching positions. But in the immediate future, he’s already got plans for Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I have a softball game I have to help coach for my daughter. I’ve gotta now devote the same energy and time to my family that I dedicated to the game of baseball,” Koehler said. “I’ve been playing pro ball for 12-13 years. Every day of my life has been scheduled around what I need to do baseball-wise.”</p>
<p>Now Koehler will go home and be a family man.</p>
<p><strong>Archer update</strong></p>
<p>Chris Archer threw a live BP on Monday at Pirate City. Archer was scratched from his start last week with neck tightness, but the Pirates feel confident that Archer will be ready for the season. It’s still unknown when Archer will pitch in Grapefruit League play.</p>
