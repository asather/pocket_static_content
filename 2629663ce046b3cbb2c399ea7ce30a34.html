<h1>Joe Starkey’s mailbag: Is the Pirates’ bullpen the raging disaster it appears to be?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lee Lacy and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>al, @dispatcher44:</strong> over/under on the pirates bullpen era 10.50</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Well, it’s over at the moment, Dr. dispatcher. Somewhere around 13 through two exhibition games, I believe. A small sample size, yes, but here’s the bad news: THE WHOLE SEASON is a small sample size, and bullpens will be more important than usual (and they were already kind of important).</p>
<p>Not long ago, I was bullish on this group, but that was before the Keone Kela mystery and the Edgar Santana suspension.</p>
<p>This is alarming stuff as the Pirates ramp up for a short season where, as manager Derek Shelton recently said, “I definitely think bullpens will be utilized more. You may see leverage guys used a little sooner in games. It could be more on par with how teams have run their bullpens during a playoff series or during a pennant stretch.”</p>
<p>Kyle Crick, Richard Rodriguez and Michael Feliz have shown talent but also some serious blowup ability. Nick Burdi remains an unknown commodity.</p>
<p>I don’t like the looks of it, Al. Not one bit. I’d still bet the under on 10.50 — but not with overwhelming confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Dobson, @dobber7466:</strong> What Steelers rookie will have the greatest impact? I understand that with limited offseason work the rookies will be at a huge disadvantage. I think it will be Anthony McFarland based on his speed.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I loved the McFarland pick, Mr. dobber7466. I think the Steelers will get the McFarland from his first year at Maryland, not the player who struggled with an ankle injury his second year.</p>
<p>However, my gut tells me Chase Claypool will have the biggest impact this season. You’re right, rookies across the league will have a tough time acclimating to the NFL because of the lack of offseason activity — including, apparently, no preseason games — but Claypool has a specific skill set that translates to immediate success: He can win jump balls in the red zone, based on his size and freakish athletic ability.</p>
<p>And he will.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry O’Donnell, @PittMsie:</strong> Will there be college football this fall?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Ron Cook tackled this issue the other day and answered with a resounding no, Dr. O’Donnell. I’m still thinking big money combined with political backing could make for conference-only games among the big boys. Not a great chance. But a chance. There is just so much money at stake and so much economic damage on the horizon — to colleges and college towns — if there is no football. Maybe a season in the spring is the ultimate answer, but I’m not ruling out fall.</p>
<p><strong>Connie McGinley, @StanceLey:</strong> Which fan base do you feel is the most annoying: New England Patriots, Philadelphia Flyers, Cleveland Browns or Washington Capitals? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Wonderful question, Connie. And while I’ve had issues with all four (mostly in good fun, sort of), I have found Patriots fans to be the most arrogant and defensive. Not all of them, of course. Just the ones who contact me every time I refer to “Spygate” in a column. They seem to believe nothing nefarious happened there.</p>
<p>I always wonder: Why did the Patriots do it for so long, then, and why did Roger Goodell have the tapes destroyed?</p>
<p><strong>tim rickenbach, @TimRickenbach:</strong> over / under on Pirates 60 game season.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> You mean wins or games played, Tim? I will assume wins — and Vegas seems to have the number pegged at 25.5. I’m going under. Not enough pitching. Already two key players (Kela, Polanco) with uncertain availability, and that’s on a team with precious little depth. Vibe not good.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Rizzer, @PSUPill:</strong> Why are the national rags picking Pitt to be 4th in the Coastal Div &amp; the local guys are saying a Pitt might go 10 and 2? I can’t reconcile the two.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> First, I enjoy the term national “rags,” Richard. It’s an oldie but a goodie. Second, which “local guys” do you speak of? People were picking Pitt to go 10-2?</p>
<p>That probably cannot happen now, because the schedule’s shrinking. The Richmond game is gone — and I think we’ll be lucky to get a conference-only season in.</p>
<p>But I will say this: If the over/under on Pitt’s win total was 6.5 on a 12-game schedule — and that is what I saw — I would have gleefully picked the over. The Panthers won seven games against a harder schedule last season and have a better team returning.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have picked 10-2, but Pitt seemed like a lock for at least seven wins. Probably nine. They were a great bet to beat 6.5 wins.</p>
<p><strong>not a pirate, @RevD98:</strong> Is AB done? Does it matter where a MLB team plays if there are no fans? When is the next time the Bills lose another Super Bowl?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yes, based on the construct of a team in a given ballpark.</p>
<p>Next season.</p>
<p>And thank you for the questions, Mr. not a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Reese, @BuStA607:</strong> Would the Penguins still get past Montreal without Sid?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Yes, Bobby, although I don’t get the impression that Sidney Crosby’s situation is anything to worry about. (Then again, we’ve all seen hockey situations go from nothing to something in a hurry.) The Penguins are simply way better than the Canadiens, even without Crosby, and remember the Geno Factor. When Crosby has missed time over the course of his career — including this season — Evgeni Malkin always seems to go wild.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Lohr, @brilohr7:</strong> Will Antonio Brown be a first ballot Hall of Famer?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Not first ballot, Mr. Lohr. Maybe not at all, although I believe he absolutely belongs (I’m not a voter). Two or three more typical years and his career numbers would make an inarguable case.</p>
<p>At this point, if it all ends now, I could see voters keeping him out — or at least making him wait a very long time once he becomes eligible.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Fleming, @JasonFleming54:</strong> The World of Outlaw Sprint cars are at Lernerville Speedway Tuesday night. NASCAR driver Kyle Larson will be racing, he's composed perhaps the most impressive string of finishes in series' history, yet you guys once again fail to make any mention of local motorsports news. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Because this is the first I’ve heard of it, Dr. Fleming. I will mention it today. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Dwight Newton, @bundlesofluv:</strong> Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I am Joe.</p>
