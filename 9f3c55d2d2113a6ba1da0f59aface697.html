<h1>On-site alcohol sales in Pa. to be extended one hour to 11 p.m.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In a change from their original order relaxing some COVID-19 restrictions, Gov. Tom Wolf and Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine have announced that restaurants can now sell alcohol on-site until 11 p.m., one hour later than previously ordered.</p>
<p>This will go into effect Monday and will apply to restaurants that self-certify and move to 50% capacity that day, as well as to restaurants that choose to stay at the 25% limit.</p>
<p>When the governor had originally announced that restaurants could change their capacity limits to 50% after a self-certification process, the order said that alcohol sales had to stop at 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf and Dr. Levine signed the new order on Thursday.</p>
<p>“As we continue to take critical steps to continue to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, we also recognize that this pandemic has taken a significant toll on the food services industry, so we must balance public health and economic recovery,” Mr. Wolf said in a news release. “These orders give restaurants the ability to increase indoor occupancy safely while giving customers confidence when deciding to patronize a restaurant.”</p>
<p>The self-certification documents will be available online on Monday.</p>
<p>Restaurants are being told they should complete the online self-certification process by Oct. 5, when enforcement relative to 50% percent occupancy will begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, the state reported 760 new cases of COVID-19, and 21 more virus-related deaths.</p>
<p>Western Pennsylvania accounted for 188 of the state’s new cases, with Allegheny County having the largest daily increase with 68 new cases, followed by Mercer County with 21 new cases.</p>
<p>The 68 additional diagnoses in Allegheny County&nbsp;come from 833 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests taken between Sept. 3 and Sept. 16.&nbsp;Those recently testing positive range in age from 1 to 98, with a median age of 33.</p>
<p>The new cases bring the county total to 11,578 since the pandemic started in March.&nbsp;Statewide, cases total 148,683.</p>
<p>With the addition of Friday’s newly reported deaths, 7,934 people have so far died of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. Of the 21 latest deaths, the Pittsburgh region reported seven: four in Allegheny County and one each in Armstrong, Beaver and Washington counties.</p>
<p>The four new deaths in Allegheny include one person in their 60s, one in their 70s and two people in their 80s. The deaths occurred between Sept. 4 and Sept. 11, and two deaths are associated with a long-term care facility, according to the county health department.&nbsp;The county death toll now stands at 370.</p>
