<h1>PPG sees 'positive signs' as China reopens economy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PPG is closely watching the restart of China’s economy for lessons about what to expect as the rest of the world attempts to reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, and forced the shutdown of businesses and schools across the country weeks before a significant number of cases were detected in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p>

<p>As PPG’s 12 coatings factories in China have come back on line recently, including one in Wuhan, the company has seen “measured recovery and demand,” PPG Chairman and Chief Executive Michael McGarry told Wall Street analysts Tuesday.</p>
<p>“We’ve learned a lot from the restart in China,” he said during a conference call to discuss first-quarter results.</p>
<p>The Downtown-based coatings giant on&nbsp;Monday said second-quarter sales could drop by 30% to 35% because of the global economic shutdown.&nbsp;The company said it is taking aggressive cost-cutting actions including executive salary reductions and temporary employee furloughs to deal with the impact.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, sales were about $3.4 billion, 7% below the year-ago quarter.&nbsp;Net income fell to $243 million, or $1.02 per share, down from $312 million or $1.31 per share in the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>Shares were down 5% in early afternoon trading Tuesday.</p>
<p>PPG’s factories in China have been running at 70% to 80% capacity the last several weeks and “positive signs” happening there, said Mr. McGarry, include increased vehicular traffic as people return to work, and fuller domestic flights.</p>
<p>Those trends should help PPG which makes automotive and aerospace coatings.</p>
<p>After major customers including Ford, GM and Boeing shut down production lines to tame the spread of COVID-19, PPG took a dramatic hit in China and elsewhere.</p>
<p>But it’s already seeing an upswing in sales in China as that economy reopens, Mr. McGarry said.</p>
<p>Some Chinese cities and provinces have offered consumers cash subsidies as high as $1,400 to buy cars, according to a report from CNN.</p>
<p>Mr. McGarry said the industry could also benefit from people buying cars to avoid mass transit because of virus fears.&nbsp;“People may shun public transportation for some time,” he said. “That will be a positive for us.”</p>
<p>Pent-up demand for house paints has helped boost retail paint outlets that were closed throughout Europe as the pandemic spread, Mr. McGarry said.</p>
<p>In places like the United Kingdom and France, there’s been “latent demand and a pop” when stores reopen, he said.</p>
<p>Most paint stores in the U.S. have remained open and those closed by local government regulations offer delivery options at other locations, said Mr. McGarry.</p>
<p>PPG company has 47,000 employees worldwide and about 2,400 in the Pittsburgh region.&nbsp;It did not provide details of how many workers have been temporarily furloughed or specifics on executive pay cuts.</p>
<p>On Monday, PPG said it withdrew financial guidance for the year because of a “heightened level of uncertainty over global economic demand.”</p>
