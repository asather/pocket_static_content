<h1>Former Hopewell star Shatori Walker-Kimbrough preparing for 'grueling' WNBA season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Getting traded during a global pandemic is enough to send a professional athlete into a tailspin. But switching teams twice in the span of two days would test anyone’s mental fortitude.</p>
<p>That’s what happened to Shatori Walker-Kimbrough, the Aliquippa native and former Hopewell High School basketball star coming off <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2019/11/06/Shatori-Walker-Kimbrough-WNBA-champion-Washington-Mystics-Hopewell-basketball/stories/201911060002" target="_blank">her first WNBA championship win</a> with the Washington Mystics. <a href="https://liberty.wnba.com/news/liberty-trade-charles-in-three-team-deal/" target="_blank">She was traded</a> to the New York Liberty on April 15 as part of a three-team deal that included the Dallas Wings. Two days later on draft night, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/wnba/mercury/2020/04/17/mercury-pick-virginia-wing-jocelyn-willoughby-wnba-draft-first-round/5150594002/" target="_blank">she was dealt</a>&nbsp;to the Phoenix Mercury for the No. 10 overall pick.</p>
<p>The 5-foot-9, fourth-year guard is now firmly entrenched with the Mercury and has been preparing for a whirlwind WNBA season that’s set to tip off Saturday in the league’s “bubble” at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. The shortened season will involve 22 regular-season games per squad with little rest between them, a marathon for every one of the league’s 12 teams.</p>
<p>“I’m just praying for everyone’s health,” Walker-Kimbrough said. “Not just COVID, but with the grueling season we have ahead.”</p>
<p>The WNBA’s 2020 season was supposed to begin May 15 but, like most American pro sports, was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The campaign starts with a noon game on ESPN between the Liberty and Seattle Storm before a 3 p.m. contest on ABC featuring the Mercury and Los Angeles Sparks.</p>
<p>Walker-Kimbrough spent most of the last few months in the Pittsburgh area visiting family and staying in shape “to be as ready as possible” before the league nailed down a new start date. She hasn’t officially moved to Arizona yet, but it turned out she didn’t have to worry about that this year with the league opting to play all its games in Florida.</p>
<p>She did travel to Phoenix pre-bubble for about two weeks and experienced the “extended nose swab” COVID test that she described as being “probably the longest four seconds of my life,” though ultimately not too bad. In Florida, Walker-Kimbrough is being tested everyday, mostly with shorter nose swabs and mouth-throat swabs that only take about 30 seconds.</p>
<p>All these measures have given her confidence in the WNBA’s ability to pull off a full season despite all the challenges COVID presents.</p>
<p>“We wish we had more information on COVID, but it is what it is,” Walker-Kimbrough said. “Just take necessary precautions, wear your mask and try to social distance, just the things we can control. I think we’ll be OK.”</p>
<p>Her one medical concern about the WNBA’s restart doesn’t involve her, but rather former Mystics teammate Elena Delle Donne.</p>
<p>The Washington forward has <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/elena-delle-donne-wnba-season-lyme-disease" target="_blank">suffered from chronic Lyme disease</a> since 2008, and her personal physician advised her that she is “at high risk for contracting and having complications from COVID-19,” <a href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/29456487/wnba-kicks-breanna-stewart-sabrina-ionescu-matchup" target="_blank">Delle Donne told ESPN</a>. The WNBA informed her July 13 that her request to opt out of the 2020 season due to that medical concern was denied, forcing her to choose between playing despite those health questions or opt out and not receive a salary this season.</p>
<p>“If she can’t opt out, how is anyone able to opt out?” Walker-Kimbrough said. “What are the requirements? I was just such in awe. I consider her a really close friend, and I thought it was a no-brainer. ... I just hope that she makes the right decision for herself and doesn’t feel pressured at all to do anything that she doesn’t feel comfortable doing.”</p>
<p>In addition to staving off COVID, WNBA players are also figuring out how to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/2020/06/20/wnba-players-union-nneka-ogwumike-protest-racial-inequality/3212305001/" target="_blank">best use the league’s return</a> to convey their support for the recent nationwide protests over racial inequality and police brutality following the death of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others.</p>
<p>Though the Mercury players haven’t discussed any team-wide plans yet, Walker-Kimbrough said the organization is allowing players to design specialized shoes with social messages on them. She isn’t exactly sure what hers will look like, but the imagery will invoke Black Lives Matter, Floyd and the #SayHerName campaign that began in the wake of Taylor’s death in Louisville, Ky.</p>
<p>“I do like the direction it’s going,” Walker-Kimbrough said of the country’s newfound social conscious. “I still don’t understand how Breonna Taylor’s murderers aren’t arrested. But continue to apply that pressure and say her name.”</p>
<p>With everything the WNBA is doing to get its players ready to play, Walker-Kimbrough just hopes people will tune in to the six nationally televised games the Mercury has on either ESPN or ABC to watch her and superstar teammates Diana Taurasi,&nbsp;Brittney Griner and Skylar Diggins-Smith compete for what would be her second title in two seasons.</p>
<p>She especially hopes her friends and family around Pittsburgh — especially Aliquippa — will watch her on the court during this strange WNBA season.</p>
<p>“They’ve seen me from a little kid dribbling the ball up and down the street,” Walker-Kimbrough said. “I’m super blessed that they’ve followed me and supported me through my years at Hopewell, University of Maryland, D.C., and now the Mercury.</p>
<p>“All their prayers and support comes a long way, and I’m super thankful to have that backbone.”</p>
