<p>A male was arrested Friday night after SWAT and police arrived at the scene responding to reports of a domestic dispute at a residence on the 600 block of Lenora Street around 9 p.m. in the Larimer neighborhood, according to Public Safety spokesperson Chris Togneri.</p>
<p>When Zone 5 officers tried to make contact with the male, police say he refused to exit the home.</p>
<p>SWAT was then called to the scene and neighboring residences were evacuated.</p>
<p>Police say the man climbed through a window and onto a roof of the two-story house. Around 10:30 p.m., SWAT officers gained access to the roof and took the man into custody without incident, Mr. Togneri said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man was arrested on an outstanding warrant for an unrelated domestic incident.</p>
