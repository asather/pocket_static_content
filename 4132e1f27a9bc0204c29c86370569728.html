<h1>Steelers-Giants: Brian Batko's Week 1 scouting report</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>When Giants have the ball</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Key performers:</strong> QB Daniel Jones, RB Saquon Barkley, RB Dion Lewis, WR Sterling Shepard, WR Golden Tate, WR Darius Slayton, TE Evan Engram, LT Andrew Thomas</p>
<p><strong>What’s been working:</strong> Despite finishing 4-12 last year, the Giants were the NFL’s sixth-best rushing team at 4.8 yards per carry. You can chalk that up to having a generational talent in the backfield in Barkley, who also ranked sixth in the league with an average of 2.8 yards after contact. Jones could’ve done much worse as a rookie thrust into a starting role, throwing for 3,027 yards and 24 touchdowns to 12 interceptions after taking over for Eli Manning as the starter in Week 3.</p>
<p><strong>Who’s hot (or not):</strong> The tight end tandem of Engram and 2019 sixth-round pick Kaden Smith could be sneakily effective this season. Engram, a first-round pick in 2017 with freakish athleticism, was off to his best start as a pro before knee and foot injuries ended his third season. In his stead, Smith — who’s much more of a traditional tight end — finished the year with 14 catches, 133 yards and two touchdowns in Weeks 16 and 17.</p>
<p><strong>Game plan:</strong> Speaking of Engram and Smith, look for a lot of two-tight end sets from offensive coordinator and play-caller Jason Garrett. Not only did he use plenty of 12 personnel as the Cowboys head coach, but his new boss Joe Judge was in New England at the end of the Rob Gronkowski-Aaron Hernandez years. But hey, they've also got arguably the most dynamic back on earth, so expect Barkley to be used often as a rusher and receiver, with former Pitt star Dion Lewis spelling him enough to keep him fresh for a full season.</p>
<p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> The whole Giants offensive line. At left tackle they're starting rookie Andrew Thomas, who was the fourth overall pick but was expected to begin his career at right tackle until Nate Solder opted out of the season. Thus, at right tackle they’ll roll out Cameron Fleming, a journeyman with 26 career starts, including just three last year in Dallas with Garrett. Oh, and at center is Nick Gates, an undrafted rookie two years ago who started three games last season at tackle and guard. Good luck against that Steelers front, fellas.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>When Steelers have the ball</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Key performers:</strong> DE Dexter Lawrence, DT Leonard Williams, NT Dalvin Tomlinson, MLB Blake Martinez, OLB Markus Golden, CB James Bradberry, SS Jabrill Peppers, DB Logan Ryan</p>
<p><strong>What’s been working:</strong> Not enough to avoid spending big money on two free-agent additions in the offseason. After allowing the eighth-most yards per game last year, the Giants spent $75 million on Martinez, the NFL’s second-leading tackler in 2019, and Bradberry, who had eight interceptions in four seasons with Carolina. The Giants did rank sixth in the league in rush defense thanks to Lawrence, Williams and Tomlinson holding down the fort up front.</p>
<p><strong>Who’s hot (or not):</strong> A year ago, Corey Ballentine was entering the NFL as a sixth-round pick out of Division II Washburn College. Now he enters his second season as the starting cornerback opposite Bradberry on the Giants depth chart and has struggled at times in training camp. Deandre Baker, a first-round pick last year, should’ve been the man for the job but got arrested in May, then waived this week. Sam Beal could’ve started, too, but opted out of this season.</p>
<p><strong>Game plan:</strong> Defensive coordinator Patrick Graham had the Dolphins 11th in the league in blitz percentage last year, and he has better personnel to work with now in the Big Apple. It all starts up front and Lawrence regularly occupies two blockers at 342 pounds, which can create gaps for Williams and Tomlinson, who need to provide more production than their four combined sacks last year. Expect Bradberry to shadow JuJu Smith-Schuster and try to press him at the line of scrimmage while the versatile Peppers moves around the secondary.</p>
<p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> A couple new chess pieces. Ryan won two Super Bowls with New England and was highly productive the past three years in Tennessee, but where will he be deployed? He could see time at both slot corner and safety, but rookie fourth-rounder Darnay Holmes also has impressed in camp and may be used in various packages when the Giants flood the field with defensive backs.</p>
<p><strong>Special teams</strong></p>
<p>If you think the Giants offensive line and secondary sound shaky, check out their kicking game. Aldrick Rosas, second-team All-Pro two years ago, was charged with a hit-and-run in July and subsequently released, so they're going with former Panthers Pro Bowler Graham Gano, who spent all last season on injured reserve. … Punter Riley Dixon was a master of fakes in college at Syracuse but had two punts blocked last year. … Tate is listed as the No. 1 punt returner, but the veteran wideout didn't do much damage there last season.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Keys to victory</strong></span></p>
<p><em><strong>To win, the Giants must…</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Get it right the first time.</strong> New coach, new play-callers, new cogs on both sides of the ball must come together quickly after an abbreviated offseason.</p>
<p><strong>Take a big shot.</strong> Jones and Slayton flashed deep-ball potential last year, and burning this Steelers defense once is much more likely than moving the ball consistently.</p>
<p><strong>Be the stranger.</strong> Use unfamiliarity as an advantage in a year no one saw you in the preseason and can only speculate what you might do on offense, defense and even special teams.</p>
<p><em><strong>To win, the Steelers must…</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap Captain Saquon.</strong> Barkley can get the Giants by with his burst and speed alone, so run to the ball and don’t let him be a one-man show.</p>
<p><strong>Start the fire up front.</strong> Facing an unproven line and a QB who led the NFL in fumbles lost last year, T.J. Watt, Bud Dupree and Co. should be licking their chops for strip sacks and big stops.</p>
<p><strong>Get in a New York state of mind.</strong> Going on the road during a pandemic is a first this week for the Steelers and 15 other teams, but they can't let it be a distraction or reason for a slow start.</p>
