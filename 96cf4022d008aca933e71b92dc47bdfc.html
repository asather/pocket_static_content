<h1>Carnegie Mellon moving all research away from campus, closes libraries, pare operations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University is shifting all research activities off-campus, closing its libraries at 6 p.m. Friday and will curtail services and operations except those needed to maintain safety and remote instruction, president Farnam Jahanian <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/alert/coronavirus/communications/mar-19a-2020.html" target="_blank">told campus</a>&nbsp;late Thursday.</p>
<p>The relocation and reduction of campus presence is similar to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/18/University-Pittsburgh-COVID19-coronavirus-closing-reductioin-Gallagher-Bradford-Greensburg-Johnstown-Titusville/stories/202003180154" target="_blank">an announcement Wednesday</a> covering all five University of Pittsburgh campuses, including Oakland. Carnegie Mellon officials said the move in general affects all its locations and is in keeping with health and government officials’ instructions to combat the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus.</p>
<p>’As soon as is practicable and no later than Wednesday, March 25 at 5 p.m. local time, we are moving all research activities to remote operations,” Mr. Jahanian said in a campus message. “Where that is not possible, on-campus research activities will be placed on hold and replaced with related off-campus work through at least the end of April.”</p>
<p>He added, “… only very specific functions including sustaining living organisms and perishable specimens and maintaining the facilities and equipment necessary to allow remote operation, will be permitted.”</p>
<p>He said workers unable to do their jobs remotely (except for those in collective bargaining agreements) will be shifted to other duties able to be done off campus. “In&nbsp;the event remote work is not possible, we will work with those employees on a case by case basis to try and address their situation, so they are able to earn their compensation,” he said.</p>
