<h1>Pitt football notebook: Pat Narduzzi on injuries, N.C. State, Steelers' postponement</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Like most in his profession, Pat Narduzzi doesn’t like talking about injuries. But on Thursday afternoon, the Pitt coach sounded optimistic about a pair of players who left last weekend’s Louisville game and didn’t return.</p>
<p>Gabe Houy, Pitt’s starting right tackle, is “ready to roll” on Saturday against N.C. State, and running back A.J. Davis is expected back on the field “very, very, very soon,” Narduzzi said on a Zoom call with reporters.</p>
<p>Houy, a former Upper St. Clair standout, practiced this week after suffering what seemed to be a hand or wrist injury in the second quarter of last Saturday’s 23-20 win. Narduzzi confirmed the injury that kept Houy out was unrelated to the lineman’s offseason shoulder surgery, which would’ve sidelined him throughout spring ball if the COVID-19 pandemic didn’t cancel most of camp.</p>
<p>Houy started six games at guard and chipped in at tackle last year before moving outside full-time. The 6-foot-6, 300-pound redshirt junior beat out Hampton transfer Keldrick Wilson and classmate Carson Van Lynn in August for the starting role at right tackle.</p>
<p>Growing alongside Butler native and right guard Jake Kradel, Houy was missed against Louisville when he went down. Wilson was inserted in his place but was replaced in favor of Van Lynn after just two plays, on one of which he allowed a speed rush past him en route to Kenny Pickett.</p>
<p>Pitt’s quarterback could have Davis beside him in the shotgun helping him out on Saturday after Narduzzi said the tailback might return as early as the N.C. State game. “Never know,” the coach added with a curious grin.</p>
<p>Whether or not A.J. Davis can go, expect Vincent Davis — Pitt’s leading ball-carrier through three games — to continue getting opportunities. True freshman Israel Abanikanda could get an extended look, as well, after rushing for 41 yards on nine carries against Louisville.</p>
<p>As for two other starters — tight end Lucas Krull and middle linebacker Wendell Davis — Narduzzi reiterated on Thursday that their injuries are not season-ending. Krull and Wendell Davis, after playing against Syracuse, didn’t dress for the Louisville game and were seen on the sidelines on crutches.</p>
<p><strong>QB dilemma?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone knows Pickett will line up at quarterback for Pitt. But N.C. State doesn’t quite have that clarity at the moment. When asked on Thursday who will start under center, Wolfpack coach Dave Doeren said “we’ll find out on Saturday.”</p>
<p>N.C. State has two quarterbacks, redshirt sophomore Devin Leary and redshirt junior Bailey Hockman, that might get the nod. Leary is more likely than Hockman to start after the latter threw a pair of interceptions in N.C. State’s 45-24 loss to Virginia Tech last weekend.</p>
<p>Leary, who started the Wolfpack’s final five games of 2019, replaced Hockman and completed 12 of 16 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown against the Hokies.</p>
<p>“Looking at Leary, he knows how to really get the ball out. He knows where to go with the football,” Narduzzi said. “I think he’s got a strong arm. I think he throws a nice deep ball. He’s mobile enough to get out of the pocket and make something happen with his feet, kind of like a Kenny Pickett-type of guy. ... I think he’s their best quarterback at this point. I think they kind of know that.”</p>
<p><strong>A not-so-subtle reminder</strong></p>
<p>The team Pitt shares its South Side facility with isn’t playing football this weekend as originally planned. That struck a chord with Narduzzi.</p>
<p>The Steelers’ Week 4 game against the Tennessee Titans was officially postponed on Thursday, the first NFL postponement during the coronavirus pandemic. The decision was made after several members of the Titans’ organization tested positive for COVID-19 this week.</p>
<p>Narduzzi said the postponement was a reminder of “how fragile the world is right now,” something he expressed to his players.</p>
<p>“I talked to them about how you’ve got to play this game like it’s our last game,” Narduzzi said. “We’re blessed to go out there and get Number 4 in this week. ... I’m harping on those details, that we wash our hands, wear our masks when around people and keep our distance. I’m sure Tennessee was doing that, but something got in the bubble. Somehow, someway. It can happen that quickly.”</p>
