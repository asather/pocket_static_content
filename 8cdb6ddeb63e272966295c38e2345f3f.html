<h1>Youngstown prison contractor tests positive for COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A contractor for the company that operates the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, which houses some inmates for the U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh, has tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>According to a letter from Warden Michael Phillips sent to inmates on Tuesday, he received notice that a contractor for CoreCivic tested positive, and had been inside the Youngstown facility on April 2.</p>
<p>A spokesman for CoreCivic said the contractor worked for TransCor, which provides transportation for prisoners.</p>
<p>Neither the spokesman nor letter said how many people may have been exposed to that employee.</p>
<p>In his letter, Warden Phillips said the company had enacted its emergency response plan which identifies staff and inmates who may have had close contact with the contractor, and require isolation.</p>
<p>“This response enables the facility to take the steps necessary to ensure the facility is properly disinfected for your health and safety,” the letter said.</p>
<p>The warden noted, too, that local public health officials had also been notified.</p>
<p>All social visitation at the facility was canceled as of March 12.</p>
<p>The facility is housing about 1,800 inmates and has a capacity of about 1,900, said employee Carey Thake.</p>
