<h1>Paul Zeise: Pirates' best players need to play better, but they also need to play more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates are 2-7 and off to a rotten start at the plate as a team. They’re hitting so terribly that you aren’t sure if you are looking at their batting averages or the midterm grade point averages of the Delta fraternity from&nbsp;“Animal House.”</p>
<p>And even though there isn’t anyone at the Blutarsky level of zero-point-zero, there are a number of guys who seem to be flirting with it. I mean, close your eyes and then recite this list in your best Dean Wormer voice and you’d swear the Pirates are getting ready to be put on double secret probation.</p>
<p>“Mr. Polanco, zero-point-seven one.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Heredia, zero-point-seven seven.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Gonzalez, zero-point-eight three.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Dyson, zero-point-nine-five.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Stallings, one-point-four three.”</p>
<p>“Now I want you to tell Mr. Bell (.189), Mr. Newman (.179) and Mr. Frazier (.167), exactly what I am about to tell you now ... .”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, you can open your eyes now and we can get back to reality. We don’t need to expel any Pirates yet, but, goodness, those are some really ugly batting averages. The team batting average entering Monday was .177 and the slash line was in the neighborhood of embarrassingly bad (.177/.241/.299).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scary thing is this: hitting is supposed to be one of the things the Pirates do reasonably well. No, they aren’t blessed with power, but they have enough players who have proven they can hit major league pitching, so they shouldn’t be hitting this poorly. There are slumps and then there’s whatever this is, which is something far worse.</p>
<p>The Pirates aren’t a good team and we all knew that going into the season. They have some talent deficiencies, they lack depth, they don’t have a great bullpen and their starting rotation is average at best. But their offense should be better than it has been, and they should be producing runs at a little higher clip.</p>
<p>One thing that is frustrating about this team, however, is that we haven’t seen the best lineup given the chance to play every day for an extended stretch. Every day seems to bring a new and head-scratching lineup from Derek Shelton and his staff.</p>
<p>I am sure there are some analytics behind what it is they are doing — though I would love to see whatever the numbers are that suggest a lineup with Erik Gonzalez at third, Guillermo Heredia in right field, Cole Tucker in center and Phillip Evans in right is a good idea. It seems like they are forgetting actual players play these games, not robots.</p>
<p>The Pirates have a small group of legitimate everyday players, and they need at-bats, they need to to get into a rhythm, they need timing and they need to feel comfortable in their role from day to day. All of this shuffling around and sitting and resting guys — in a 60-game season with multiple days off&nbsp; — is not helping.</p>
<p>Gregory Polanco needs to be in the lineup every day. Jose Osuna needs to be in the lineup every day. Bryan Reynolds needs to be in the lineup every day. Colin Moran, Kevin Newman, Josh Bell and Adam Frazier all need to be in the lineup pretty much every day. Why? Because they are the team’s best hitters and all of them need the lion’s share of the at-bats.</p>
<p>I know they aren’t hitting yet, as illustrated by their averages, but at the same time, I don’t know that they have had an opportunity to get on track. This is a strange year and players are all trying to find a comfort zone, and that could take some time. The Pirates aren’t good enough to not play their best players daily.</p>
<p>I laugh when I hear the rationale of some of the decisions as trying to find out what they have. Heredia, Evans and Dyson are all veterans and we know exactly what they are and what they are capable of doing. And none of them figure to be a part of the Pirates’ long-term plans, so why are they being put out there if the goal is to find out what players are capable of?</p>
<p>Tucker is a player who may or may not be a part of the future and he is someone the Pirates need to figure out. When Ke’Bryan Hayes gets to the major league roster, I would say the same thing about him. Those are players the Pirates need to give starts as much as possible, not veterans that were brought here to plug holes.</p>
<p>The Pirates can still get on a little bit of a streak and get going, but they are already so they are running out of time to figure it out. Shelton and company need to put their best lineup out there every day and give the team the best chance possible to win games because winning is the point of playing competitive sports in the first place.</p>
