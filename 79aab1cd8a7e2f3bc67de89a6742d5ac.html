<h1>In Pittsburgh speech, Biden says Trump foments fear and violence</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In his first major speech since formally accepting his party’s presidential nomination, Democrat Joe Biden, speaking in Pittsburgh, accused President Donald Trump of building his reelection campaign on fear, instigating the violence that’s erupted on American streets and failing to protect the country in times of crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, delivering prepared remarks on Monday at Hazelwood Green’s Mill 19, questioned why anyone believes that a second Trump term in the White House would alleviate violence — when really, the president “sows chaos rather than providing order,” he said.</p>
<p>“The current president wants you to live in fear. He advertises himself as a figure of order,” Mr. Biden said. “He isn’t — and he’s not been part of the solution thus far. He’s part of the problem.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s speech comes at a time of unrest in many U.S. cities, as protesters take to the streets to call for justice and change after a white police officer in Kenosha, Wis., shot a Black man, Jacob Blake, seven times — one of several instances of police violence against Black people in recent months.</p>
<p>The former vice president denounced the use of “excessive force” by police, as well as the “violence of extremists and opportunists — right-wing militias, white supremacists, vigilantes — who infiltrate protests carrying weapons of war, hoping to wreak havoc, and to derail any hope and support for progress.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden also denounced acts of rioting and looting, claiming they’re not forms of protest but of “lawlessness, plain and simple” and worthy of prosecution.</p>
<p>Violence, Mr. Biden said, “will not bring change,” but destroy businesses, hurt working families and divide the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has “fomented” violence, Mr. Biden added.</p>
<p>“He may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is,” Mr. Biden said.</p>
<p>The Democrat framed his own candidacy as a solution to the crises America faces, including COVID-19 and its impact on the economy. It’ll start with getting rid of Mr. Trump, whose tenure he deemed a “toxin.” It’ll also mean not believing in the labels that Republicans attach to him, he said.</p>
<p>“Do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters? Really?” Mr. Biden asked. “I want a safe America. Safe from COVID. Safe from crime and looting. Safe from racially motivated violence. Safe from bad cops.”</p>
