<p>Duquesne Light reported a series of power outages across Pittsburgh to its website on Monday as high temperatures continue to bake Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The outages are currently affecting about 4,000 customers in about 20 different municipalities in the Pittsburgh area, according to Duquesne Light communications director Hollie Geitner, with the majority of the people affected in Lawrenceville.</p>
<p>“With extremely high temperatures expected to continue this week, Duquesne Light is preparing for potential outages in our service territory as more stress is placed on the electrical system,” the website said. “We are increasing our staffing and adding extra shifts in all of our Field Operation work groups to ensure that any outages will be addressed as quickly and safely as possible.”</p>
<p>Ms. Geitner also said that crews are replacing power cables in the area and that the company plans to have an estimated restoration time soon. Work crews, meanwhile, are adhering to public safety guidelines by practicing social distancing at job sites.</p>
<p>Nearly 1,700 people in Lawrenceville are affected by the outages, with several hundred more each in Bloomfield, Morningside and Stanton Heights and the rest spread throughout the remaining municipalities.</p>
<p>Any Duquesne Light customers who experience an outage are encouraged to report it to Duquesne Light’s website or call 412-393-7100.</p>
