<h1>Drug dealer admits to selling deadly fentanyl in Westmoreland</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Fayette County drug dealer admitted Tuesday that his drugs killed a man in 2017.</p>
<p>Jarrel Williams, of Washington Township, pleaded guilty to fentanyl distribution charges before U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak.</p>
<p>A grand jury had indicted him in June 2017 following an investigation by police and the DEA after the family of a man identified in court as M.S. found him dead on his bed in a Westmoreland County home on Jan. 18, 2017.</p>
<p>He was 33. Next to his body, police found stamp bags marked "It's Hot."</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Haller said agents examined the victim's phone and identified a friend who had used the drugs with him the day before. Through that friend, they were able to identify Williams, 29 at the time, as the supplier of the "It's Hot" stamp bags and set up a controlled buy from him.</p>
<p>That led to a search of his house in Arnold City on Jan. 19. An examination of his phone confirmed he was the dealer who sold the drugs on Jan. 17.</p>
<p>He said nothing in court except to answer the judge's questions about his guilt.</p>
<p>As part of his plea deal with the government, he'll be sentenced in June to 162 months in federal prison. The judge will also order him to pay restitution to the victim's family for the cost of his funeral.</p>
