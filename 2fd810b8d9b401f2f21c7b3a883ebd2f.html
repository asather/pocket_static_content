<h1>CMU cancels fall sports due to COVID-19 concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Carnegie Mellon made a tough decision Wednesday, opting to <a href="https://athletics.cmu.edu/generalnews/2019-2020/cmu2020fallstatement" target="_blank">cancel its slate of fall sports</a> due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The decision affects multiple Tartan athletics programs, including football, volleyball, men’s and women’s soccer, men’s and women’s cross country, men’s and women’s golf, and men’s and women’s tennis. No decision has been made yet regarding the status of winter sports.</p>
<p>“Over the past few months, we have explored every possible avenue for a safe return to play,” CMU athletic director Josh Centor wrote in an email to athletes that was also shared in a press release. “In the message that I wrote to you last month, I noted that the health and safety of our students, staff and community members are at the forefront of every decision we make. With that as our guiding principle, we cannot appropriately return to sport at this time.”</p>
<p>The Tartans’ move came on the same day the Ivy League also decided to forgo fall sports in 2020, according to reports.</p>
<p>Additionally, the University Athletic Association — the Division III conference in which CMU competes — also announced its intention to “move away from a conference-adopted schedule” for fall athletic competitions.</p>
<p>“While it is heartbreaking to contemplate a fall semester without UAA competition, our commitment to student health and safety is at odds with a conference schedule that would require travel at significant distances,” said Farnam Jahanian, CMU president and chair of the UAA Presidents Council.</p>
<p>“We look forward to a return to play within the UAA as soon as we can, and I am confident that we will be stronger than ever when we can once again compete.”</p>
