<h1>Business owner and political novice challenging state Senate Democratic leader in primary </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A political newcomer is challenging a longtime state senator from a well-known political family in the Democratic primary for the 43rd district.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, 62, is facing first-time political candidate Bill Brittain, 38, who co-owns Shadyside Nursery. Mr. Costa has served as Senate Democratic leader since 2011.</p>
<p>Mr. Brittain, of Forest Hills, says he is running to counter the effects of big money on the political system. He got involved with political activism through his business, which led to involvement in the Pennsylvania Farmers Union and working on marijuana policy and farm policy.</p>
<p>“As a normal citizen, I felt compelled to run,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Costa, who has been in the state Senate since 1996, has served as the Democratic leader there since 2011. He’s one of the most prominent Democrats in Harrisburg and one of the few high-profile Democrats from the western part of the state. He served as Allegheny County Register of Wills in the 1990s before his election to the state Senate.</p>
<p>Mr. Costa is the last member of his political family holding elected office. His relatives —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2017/11/08/pennsylvania-election-Democratic-socialist-candidates-defeat-incumbents/stories/201711080125?cid=search" target="_blank">Ron Costa, who was a district judge</a>,&nbsp;former state Rep. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2018/05/15/Paul-Costa-Dom-Costa-Summer-Lee-Sara-Innamorato-incumbents-lose-state-House/stories/201805150126" target="_blank">Dom Costa, and former state Rep. Paul Costa&nbsp;— all lost re-election bids after challenges by more left-leaning candidates</a> who were endorsed by the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America.</p>
<p>Mr. Costa said he is running to continue to be a voice for his constituents in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>Among the top issues he has championed, he cites his work on health care — from working on a consent decree and resolution in the UPMC-Highmark dispute, to championing the expansion of Medicaid for low-income Pennsylvanians during the administration of Republican Gov. Tom Corbett, to fighting to ensure the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2018/12/20/State-Senate-Dems-will-introduce-health-care-bills-in-light-of-ACA-ruling/stories/201812200133" target="_blank">protections of the Affordable Care Act remain in place, even if the law is struck down in an ongoing federal court case</a>.</p>
<p>“As we speak today, we are continuing to fight to make sure Pennsylvania has many provisions of the Affordable Care Act,” Mr. Costa said.</p>
<p>He also cited his work on environmental issues such as working with Gov. Tom Wolf on greenhouse gas issues and his work on campaign finance reform.</p>
<p>While other Costas were defeated by challenges from the party’s progressive wing, Mr. Costa says he believes he’s in step with today’s Democratic party, as evidenced by a slew of endorsements, such as from labor organizations, environmental groups, anti-gun violence groups, LGBT community groups such as the Steel City Stonewall Democrats, and Planned Parenthood PA PAC.</p>
<p>“That’s indicative of my record,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Brittain said in some ways he is running to the left of Mr. Costa, although not across the board.</p>
<p>He said he did seek the endorsement of the Democratic Socialists, but because he is a small business owner, “we weren’t a good fit necessarily.”</p>
<p>If elected, he says he would champion issues such as ending the drug war and issues felt acutely by those in his generation such as the need for student loan relief or a higher minimum wage.</p>
<p>“[I’m] arguing for a more aggressive and younger Democratic Party,” he said.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Britain also says he would be in agreement with his opponent on many issues.</p>
<p>“We’re not enemies or anything,” he says of Mr. Costa, who lives a few blocks away from him in Forest Hills, and cites issues such as the need for a higher minimum wage on which they agree.</p>
<p>“He makes the argument against me that it’s a Republican legislature, which is right,” Mr. Brittain said. Republicans hold a 28-22 majority in the chamber.</p>
<p>In a campaign video on his website, Mr. Brittain doesn’t even mention Mr. Costa by name, although he does allude to his opponent’s long tenure in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>“We live in a state where the same politicians are elected over and over again because they are backed by corporate money,” his video states.</p>
<p>Mr. Brittain has had some donations, campaign finance reports show, but he notes he has never asked for money.</p>
<p>“[I’m funding] the vast majority of this myself. I’m putting my money where my mouth is,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Costa’s most recent campaign finance filing shows more than $500,000 available, compared to about $10,000 for Mr. Brittain.</p>
<p>With restrictions to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic still in place, neither candidate is holding in-person events, although both say they are using tools such as social media to campaign.</p>
<p>The district includes many neighborhoods in Pittsburgh’s South Side, East End communities such as Oakland, Bloomfield, Shadyside, and Squirrel Hill, Eastern suburbs such as Oakmont, Verona, Penn Hills, Wilkinsburg, Edgewood, Swissvale, and Forest Hills, and parts of the Mon Valley such as Homestead, West Homestead, and Munhall.</p>
<p>No Republicans are running for the seat in the fall general election.</p>
<p>The election is Tuesday, June 2.</p>
