<h1>Ex-West Penn Hospital employee faces additional 83 charges with filming co-workers in bathroom</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former West Penn Hospital employee who was originally charged in July after, police say, he filmed co-workers without their consent last December is now facing an additional 83 charges after police recovered more videos of employees and patients.</p>
<p>Guy Caley, 52, of Canonsburg, was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/07/17/West-Penn-Hospital-Allegheny-County-District-Attorney-Stephen-A-Zappala-Jr-Highmark-Police/stories/202007170100" target="_blank">originally charged in July </a>with three counts each of invasion of privacy and illegal use of wire or oral communications after police say he used a small video camera to record employees in the bathroom. When charges were placed, Mike Manko — spokesman for Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. — said there is a concern there may be additional victims.</p>
<p>Over a month after the initial charges, Mr. Caley&nbsp;faces an additional 41 counts of intercept communications and 42 counts of invasion of privacy — a sum total of 89 charges.</p>
<p>On Dec. 17, Highmark police officers at the Bloomfield hospital responded to a report by an employee that a suspected small video camera was taped to the side of a chair directly across from the toilet in the third-floor bathroom, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Once police obtained the video camera and analyzed its contents, they found multiple videos of employees recorded “in a state of partial nudity” as they were changing in the bathroom, according to a complaint. The victims told police they did not consent to any videos or audio taken of them.</p>
<p>The video also captured Mr. Caley taping the camera to the bathroom chair, the complaint states.</p>
<p>Police interviewed Mr. Caley on Jan. 7, during which he allegedly admitted placing the camera in the bathroom Dec. 17. He also told police he&nbsp;used the same camera “several other times in the past” to capture video and audio of other employees and other people who may have used the same bathroom, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Caley told police he recording unsuspecting patients while in the radiology department, according to the complaint. Mr. Caley identified the room housing the MRI and other imaging equipment as the area where most — if not all — recordings of patients took place, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Police say they learned that Mr. Caley had a laptop computer containing downloaded videos and deleted videos from the hidden camera recordings. When Mr. Caley turned over his computer and several external hard drives, police say, investigators reviewed the materials and found dozens of files containing videos of employees and patients.</p>
<p>When asked why he would record such videos, Mr. Caley allegedly told police he was&nbsp;“curious” about what he would capture on camera.</p>
