<h1>Pittsburgh Public feeds the need for 'Little Shop of Horrors'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There’s a 21st-century appetite for live performances of the 1980s musical “Little Shop of Horrors.”&nbsp;It could be the excitement of watching a good horror yarn from the safety of a theater seat —&nbsp;we know the curtain will eventually come down on the mean green bloodsucking alien that is hellbent on world domination.</p>
<p>And vegetation that can belt out a show tune can’t be all bad, can it?</p>
<p>Well, maybe it can, but the curtain continues to rise on “Little Shop of Horrors” long after its 1982 stage premiere and the 1986 movie that remains a cult classic.</p>

<p>When Marya Sea Kaminski chose “Little Shop” for her musical directorial debut with Pittsburgh Public Theater, opening in previews Thursday, she was thinking, “It hasn’t been done for a while and it might be a little dusty.”</p>
<p>“And then when I dug into it,” she says, “it has everything: It has love, it’s got adventure, it’s got a moral underpinning told in the creepiest, most satirical way. So what really made me want to program it was, it’s a great story.”</p>
<p>Then suddenly, as if the seeds of the same idea had been sowed from coast to coast, the Alan Menken-Howard Ashman musical was taking root like it was the ‘80s all over again.</p>
<p>A much ballyhooed production starring Jonathan Groff and Christian Borle has been running off-Broadway since October and spawned a new cast album. It followed another starry version, at the Pasadena Playhouse, with George Salazar ("Be More Chill"), MJ Rodriguez ("Pose" on FX) and Amber Riley of "Glee" fame voicing the monstrous plant, Audrey II.</p>
<p>The long-rumored movie remake of "Little Shop of Horrors" recently was revealed as one of the recipients of California’s Film &amp; Television Tax Credit Program, which&nbsp;started tongues wagging about the cast. Website Collider was among those reporting that <a href="https://collider.com/billy-porter-little-shop-of-horrors-audrey-ii-voice/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh native Billy Porter is in talks to voice man-eating plant Audrey II </a>and Lady Gaga as a possible Audrey.</p>
<p>“It’s having a moment, isn’t it?” says Kaminski, the Public’s artistic director.</p>
<p>She is having a grand time in rehearsals, working with Grammy-winning musical director John McDaniel and a cast of eight that includes Carnegie Mellon University graduate Philippe Arroyo, who recently finished a three-year stint in the touring company of “Aladdin.”</p>
<p>Arroyo played one of Aladdin’s buddies, but now he has the lead as Seymour Krelborn, a self-described schlub who works for hard-hearted boss Mr. Mushnik — Marc Moritz of “The Scottsboro Boys” at Playhouse Rep — in a sad little flower shop. Seymour adores co-worker Audrey (Lauren Marcus of Broadway’s “Be More Chill”), but she’s dating a sadistic dentist (Pittsburgh actor Patrick Cannon) … you probably think you know the rest from the movie, but there are differences between the film and stage musical.</p>

<p>What doesn’t change is that Seymour’s fortunes rise when he comes into possession of an exotic plant. And, of course, as in all things that seem too good to be true, there’s a catch —&nbsp;just one of the lessons to be learned when you enter the&nbsp; “Little Shop of Horrors.”</p>
<p><strong>Suddenly, he’s Seymour</strong></p>
<p>Playing Seymour is a dream come true for Florida native Arroyo, which he revealed when Kaminski and cast members shared their “ ‘Little Shop’ moments.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember when Netflix used to rent out DVDs? They would ship them to your house?” asked Arroyo, who at 26 seems too young to remember. “It was right when I was getting into musicals, and I had just seen ‘The Sound of Music’ for the first time, and my dad was very supportive of that. He rented ‘Little Shop’ and we watched, and he told me who these people were and how this movie was kind of a cult classic, like ‘Rocky Horror.’ And I loved it!”</p>
<p>The Public Theater auditions were Arroyo’s fourth time trying out for the role of Seymour, and No. 4 was the charm.</p>
<p>Preparations included the demands of three years on the road in a lavish Disney production and some help from Aladdin himself — Telly Leung, who starred in the Broadway production and who showed the young actor the ropes as his CMU alumni mentor.</p>
<p>“I thought it might never happen and then it clicked with me,” he says of landing the role. “I got certain things about it maybe I hadn’t before. And I’m so glad it did! It’s a role that’s so juicy. It’s a role any actor would want to play.”</p>
<p>Kaminski’s “moment” came while watching the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and hearing the Urchins — “Little Shop’s” girl-group chorus (Melessie Clark, Tavia Riveé and Abigail Stephenson in the Public’s production).</p>
<p>“I was what, 15? And I was like, ‘What is this? This is amazing!’ “ she recalls.</p>
<p>Voicing Audrey II, which grows to monstrous proportions during the course of the show, is Monteze Freeland, with fellow Pittsburgh actor J. Alex Noble acting as the puppeteer.&nbsp;The plant, in its man-eating stage, is meant to dwarf its surroundings, a challenge in the high-ceilinged O’Reilly Theater.</p>
<p>The most recent production in New York is housed in a tight 299-seat space, an homage to the original vision for the musical.&nbsp;Kaminski acknowledges that Menken and the late writer Ashman never wanted the show in a Broadway-sized venue.</p>
<p>“They wanted to keep it in a small house because that plant felt so huge. Different productions have solved that in many different ways,” she says, then gives some hints of how it will be solved in the O’Reilly. The scenic designer is Timothy Mackabee, who also is an associate designer for Disney’s “Frozen” on Broadway.</p>
<p>“He did something really amazing,” Kaminski says. “You know, we have those side seat banks in the O’Reilly, and he actually brought them closer and built a fire escape around them, so he’s also made a smaller, more intimate space. When you see the puppets he’s built, it’s almost like an aperture. There’s little space for much else.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Somewhere That’s Green’</strong></p>
<p>For Arroyo, returning to Pittsburgh is like a homecoming, and he expects to see his CMU professors in the house. There also will be a contingent from Florida, including dad&nbsp;Efrain, “my biggest support and best friend,” and “hopefully” his mother will come as well.</p>
<p>“Sometimes she is intimidated by the weather,” he says, mimicking her in the most delightful way, saying, “It’s too cold; I can’t,” and adding, “She’s such a Florida girl.”</p>
<p>Her son, meanwhile, was enduring winter’s cold while digging into the character he has longed to play since childhood.</p>
<p>“I kind of thought of Seymour as an archetype, in terms of the lovable, unexpected hero, and it’s so easy to just fill that role,” he says. “Now I’m realizing how much conflict is in this guy and more of his reality. The book is so well written … that it’s easy to find these juicy details, and I’m finding the whole experience so joyful.”</p>
<p>Kaminski has been diving into the details as well, mining the richly structured songs, with their ‘50s vibe, comic timing and emotional highs and lows.&nbsp;Then there are the “zinger lines” and “sweet little treasures” in the script that include references to the show’s spooky origins.</p>
<p>“At one point,” she notes, “Mr. Mushnik says, ‘Make sure Corman gets his wolfbane,’” a nod to B-movie king Roger Corman, who directed the 1960 movie that included a little-known actor named Jack Nicholson and gives the musical its title.</p>
<p>‘<strong>Feed Me, Seymour’</strong></p>
<p>Fascination with cannibalistic plants goes back way before Corman and Charles B. Griffith’s movie, which is thought to be based on the 1932 short story "Green Thoughts" by John Collier. Other possible influences were sci-fi master Arthur C. Clarke's "The Reluctant Orchid," which was inspired by H.G. Wells’ "The Flowering of the Strange Orchid,” circa 1905.</p>
<p>Kaminski posits that the bloodsucking plant that wants more, more, more can be interpreted as the lengths we’ll go to when we hunger for something.&nbsp;Seymour also craves all he has been previously denied: success, love, acceptance, and suddenly Seymour (pun intended) is faced with the killer dilemma at the center of “The Little Shop of Horrors.”</p>
<p>“It has been so damn fun to be inside this musical and work with these actors and see them play and have fun with it,” Kaminski says. “Howard Ashman and Alan Menken are such geniuses, and I feel Howard in the room, and I feel like we are building up a beautiful, effervescent adventure-style production of this show.”</p>
<p>You might even say, it’s delicious.</p>
