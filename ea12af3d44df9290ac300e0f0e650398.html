<h1>Republicans sweep 3 special elections for Pennsylvania House</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>HARRISBURG — Republicans are claiming victory and Democrats conceding defeat in three special elections Tuesday to fill empty seats in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.</p>
<p>All three seats had been held by Republicans who vacated them after winning elections to county offices last November, and Tuesday’s election maintains the 110-93 Republican majority in the state House.</p>
<p>Eric Davanzo won in a Republican-leaning district in Westmoreland County and Tim Bonner won in a Republican-leaning district based in Mercer County, while K.C. Tomlinson won in a district in politically divided Bucks County.</p>
<p>Democrats had criticized the decision by House Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, to hold the special elections apart from the April 28 primary, and then they criticized his decision not to postpone the special elections after Gov. Tom Wolf ordered a shutdown of non-essential government services to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>House Democratic Leader Frank Dermody, D-Allegheny, called the elections a “disgraceful power grab” by Republicans and Mr. Turzai, and said the results don’t reflect fair elections.</p>
<p>In a statement, state GOP chairman Lawrence Tabas said the elections show the strength of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and have fortified the party’s majority in the state House.</p>
