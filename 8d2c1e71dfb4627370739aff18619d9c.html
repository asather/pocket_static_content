<p><strong>1:15 p.m.:&nbsp;Mornings at the U.S. Capitol are for messaging</strong></p>
<p>The Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump is underway with an opening procedure that, after four days, has become strangely routine: the Senate chaplain’s prayer, the pledge of allegiance, the Senate sergeant-in-arms warning all 100 senators there to stay at their desks and remain silent.</p>
<p>In the hours before the trial, however, the U.S. Capitol is buzzing with spin. Reporters scrambled around to reach senators — some of whom make themselves readily available each morning — and get their latest take.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a fierce defender of Mr. Trump, held a press conference ahead House Democrats’ third and final day of arguments for the removal of the president. (Democrats have 7 hours and 53 minutes left to make their case.)</p>
<p>Mr. Graham slammed the argument that Mr. Trump was corrupt when he requested Ukraine to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running against Mr. Trump in this year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>“The bottom line here is that when it came to President Trump’s assistance that someone look at what happened with the Bidens and the Ukraine — I think he’s right,” Mr. Graham said. “I think somebody should.”</p>
<p>“I think that this is a legitimate inquiry” into the Bidens, Mr. Graham said. “There may be no criminal liability. … I don’t know, I want somebody to look.”</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., meeting with reporters in his office this morning, repeated his stance that removing a president months before an election is a “very, very high bar.”</p>
<p>House Democrats have to “make the case that we should, that 67 senators should decide that we are going to remove the president from office for the first time in the history of the republic,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey faulted Democrats’ arguments that Mr. Trump should be removed because he has attempted to invite foreign influence into U.S. election and will do so again.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the impeachment provision in the Constitution is meant to be a prophylactic protection against future offenses we think that somebody might commit,” Mr. Toomey said. “Whatever one may think about this president — his character, his behavior — I think there’s a very powerful presumption that it’s the American people’s decision.”</p>
<p>He said he will make a final decision on witnesses after senators complete their round of questioning next week.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that there should be an automatic presumption that there have to be witnesses,” he said. “Much of what would be discussed among fact witnesses is not in dispute in the first place.”</p>
