<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday announced a $450 million loan program for Pennsylvania’s hospitals to help them weather the financial strain expected due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The Hospital Emergency Loan Program (HELP) will offer eligible licensed hospitals loans up to $10 million each, at an interest rate of 0.5 %, for costs incurred between March 1 and Sept. 1.&nbsp;The money is intended to act as a financial bridge until funding from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is dispersed.</p>
<p>Many hospitals have lost revenue from postponed or canceled elective surgeries as they prepare&nbsp;for an expected influx of COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>“The combination of increased costs and reduced revenue has hurt many hospitals financially,” said Mr. Wolf in a release. “We must support our hospitals through this unprecedented time. When this pandemic finally ends, we’re going to need hospitals to care for our regular medical needs, like heart attacks and broken bones.”</p>
<p>Applications will be available on the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development website beginning at 10 a.m. Monday.</p>
