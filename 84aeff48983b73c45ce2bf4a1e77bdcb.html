<h1>'Circles' will be the first posthumous album from Mac Miller archive</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Here is the news that Mac Miller fans have been waiting for: “Circles,” a companion album to 2018’s “Swimming,” will be released on Jan. 17, according to an Instagram post by his family.</p>
<p>They write that he was working with star producer Jon Brion, “who dedicated himself to finishing ‘Circles’ based on his time and conversations with Malcolm.”</p>
<p>Although there have been a few leaks here and there, this will be the first official release since the September 2018 death of the Point Breeze rapper, whose given name was Malcolm McCormick.</p>
<p>Brion, who co-produced the Grammy-nominated “Swimming,” is known for his work with the likes of Fiona Apple, Kanye West, Frank Ocean, Spoon and Katy Perry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The McCormick family writes in the Instagram post,&nbsp;“At the time of his passing, Malcolm was well into the process of recording his companion album to&nbsp;‘Swimming,’ entitled ‘Circles.’ Two different styles complementing each, completing a circle —&nbsp;‘Swimming’ was the concept.</p>
<p>“We simply know that it was important to Malcolm for the world to hear it,” they add, referring people to the Instagram account <a href="http://instagram.com/92tilinfinity" target="_blank">@92tilinfinity</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Rolling Stone called&nbsp;“Swimming,” which came in the wake of the rapper’s split with singer Ariana Grande a few months before, “the most impactful album of his career.”</p>
<p>“Circles” will arrive two days before what would have been his 28th birthday on Jan. 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s been important to the family that fans celebrate the day of his birth rather than assembling on the day of his death. Independent of his family, The Mac Miller Memoir and small.w0rlds are presenting A Birthday Celebration for Mac Miller at The Club at Stage AE on Jan. 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is some fan reaction:</p>
