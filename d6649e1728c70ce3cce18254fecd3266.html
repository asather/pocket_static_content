<h1>Mark Rylance's 'Steel,' about the Battle of Homestead, is now a commissioned six-part cycle</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Oscar- and Tony-winning actor Mark Rylance's long-gestating theater project about the Battle of Homestead has found two homes outside of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“Steel,” by Rylance and Peter Reder, has been commissioned by the Guthrie Theatre of Minneapolis and American Repertory Theater at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
<p>In 2017, Rylance came to Pittsburgh to help commemorate the 125th anniversary of the 1892 Battle of Homestead,&nbsp;the strike by locked-out steelworkers that culminated in a violent clash with Pinkerton guards hired Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick.</p>
<p>Rylance, the first artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre and winner of a supporting actor Oscar for “Bridge of Spies,” came to Munhall and was joined by local actors in performing Shakespeare monologues and texts and songs that marked the Homestead anniversary.</p>
<p>Researching “Steel” brought Rylance to Pittsburgh on and off for more than a decade, and now will be a six-part American history cycle, directed by Rylance’s wife, Claire van Kampen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.americantheatre.org/2020/02/28/guthrie-art-announce-mark-rylance-co-commission/" target="_blank">The online story by American Theatre Magazine</a> Friday that announced the co-commission quoted Rylance as he spoke at the Carnegie Library of Homestead during a reading of his work. He said the history of Pittsburgh steel “is a story worthy of Shakespeare. We should never forget the role of labor and industry and what it’s done for a nation. This story is essential to American culture.”</p>

He brought his Globe Theatre company here twice, in 2003 playing Olivia in “Twelfth Night” and in 2005, playing the Duke in “Measure for Measure.”</p>
