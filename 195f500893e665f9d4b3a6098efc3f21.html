<h1>Langston Moses, high school basketball standout, transfers to Central Catholic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Langston Moses averaged more than 20 points a game for the Winchester Thurston basketball team last season as a sophomore and led the Bears to their first two WPIAL playoff wins in school history. But Moses will not be back for more next season.</p>
<p>Moses has transferred to Central Catholic. The WPIAL board of directors will meet Monday afternoon, review Moses’ transfer paperwork and then decide his eligibility. Under a PIAA rule that went into effect two years ago, Moses will not be eligible for the postseason at Central Catholic unless he meets special circumstances. The WPIAL could approve his transfer and make him eligible for the regular season, or the league could decide to bring Moses in for a future hearing, if it has questions about the reason for the transfer.</p>
<p>Moses, a 6-foot-3 forward, was the 16th leading scorer in the WPIAL during the 2019-20 regular season and he finished with a 22.8 average for a team that lost to Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in the WPIAL Class 2A semifinals. He was a WPIAL Class 2A all-section pick.</p>
<p>Moses’ departure from Winchester Thurston, a private school in Shadyside, will mean the Bears will not have their top player or coach returning this season. Jordan Marks resigned as coach shortly after the season.</p>
