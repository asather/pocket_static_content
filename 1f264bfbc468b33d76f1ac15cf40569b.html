<h1>City school board looks to amend remote learning grading guidelines</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools board will vote next week on grading guidelines for students during the remote instruction that will continue for the remainder of the academic year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several school board members speaking Wednesday at an agenda review meeting, though, said they want to make changes to the guidelines that the district proposed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some of us have received input from other stakeholders,” school board member Terry Kennedy said in a phone interview following the meeting, which was held via video conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the school district’s proposal, students still would receive a letter grade. But as long as students are sufficiently engaged in instruction, they would not receive a grade of less than 70%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, courses that are not covered in remote learning would be graded based on the average of the students’ grades from the first three quarters of the school year.</p>
<p>The proposal also includes the cancellation of final exams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any student who did not meet the expectation for engagement would be assessed a grade of&nbsp;“incomplete,” according to district spokeswoman Ebony Pugh.</p>
<p>Ms. Kennedy said she has received negative feedback about the proposed guidelines, including one teacher who told her that if students would earn no less than 70%, then all grades would be&nbsp;“meaningless.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kennedy said the district should provide students with more options. She said that she plans to propose that the district give students the choice of either a pass/incomplete or letter grade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If we don’t consider all options, then we’re not doing right by people,” she said.&nbsp;“I have no idea how people will respond, but I think putting the choice in the hands of students [is a good idea].”</p>
<p>David May-Stein, the district’s chief of school performance, said last week that administrators considered a number of grading systems, including pass/fail or no credit. They were concerned, however, that moving to a pass/fail-type system could decrease the level of engagement students would have if they did not believe they had to show the same amount of effort as they would to get an “A.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kennedy said she was concerned about students who had issues with access to technology or faced other roadblocks, such as English language learners. Even beyond those barriers, she said, the rapid move to remote instruction likely will cause the district “to have problems getting it right.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>School board member Cynthia Falls said in the meeting that she had discussed grading guidelines for remote learning that centered on equity with the Pennsylvania School Board Association.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re all pulling from all different resources so that we can do the best and the most equitable grading system that we can all put our heads together and do,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Board member Pam Harbin said during the meeting that she also would like to see adjustments made to the proposed guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I know we’re all working in a completely new environment, and it is not like being in schools,” Ms. Harbin said. “So coming up with a policy that will acknowledge that everybody independently is trying their best during these times, including our teachers, who also maybe have students at home and trying to manage all that [is important].”</p>
<p>Ms. Kennedy said her plan to provide students with options was similar to what she has seen some colleges and universities do as their facilities shut down amid the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as transcripts go, she said she believes colleges and universities will be understanding of the challenges students faced this semester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think there’s a lot of leeway,” she said,&nbsp;“and I don’t think we need to be stressing people out.”&nbsp;</p>
