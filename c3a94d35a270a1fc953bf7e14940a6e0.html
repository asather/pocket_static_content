<h1>North Hills School District to form diversity task force </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The North Hills School District will form a diversity task force and review all its policies, including on the use of force, in light of recent social justice protests.</p>
<p>School board President Allison Mathis read a statement on behalf of the board and Superintendent Patrick Mannarino at the beginning of the board’s June 4 virtual meeting.</p>
<p>“Over the past week, our nation and community have been grappling with the tragic death of George Floyd and other similar incidents of racism. There is a lot of pain, anxiety, hurt and fear. The path forward requires open and honest conversations,” he said.</p>
<p>The district also will publish a list of anti-racism references and resources for families; identify achievement gaps and work on closing them; partner with community groups, families and leaders that represent the racial, ethnic and cultural diversity of the district; and work on attracting minority teachers and administrators, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Board member Deanna Philpott said that the racial and ethnic makeup of the district has remained steady in the 20 years since she graduated.</p>
<p>“I think it is time for us to really prioritize diversity and racial justice,” she said.</p>
<p>In other business, Mr. Mannarino said he is forming a “reopening planning committee,” made up of teachers, administrators and school board members, to address the county being in the red, yellow, green and no restrictions phases, and will include “a hybrid model if necessary.”</p>
<p>Also included would be calendar options that would start school before Aug. 25 for students “to get the most possible time with their teachers in case COVID spikes in the fall and winter,” he said.</p>
<p>The committee also will identify a coordinator and decide on protocols for face masks, social distancing, symptom monitoring and “what constitutes a large gathering,” he added.</p>
<p>Lindsay Radzvin, director of food service, said during her annual report that they will be emphasizing prepackaged and individually wrapped items, and are considering order forms for lunches, which could be delivered to classrooms if the cafeterias cannot open.</p>
<p>Also, board member Kathy Reid addressed her frequent absences from board meetings. Mrs. Reid said that she was in the hospital and a nursing home, and had a toe amputated.</p>
<p>“I’m doing everything I can, and I want to remain on the board,” she said. “To me, I bring the history on the board.”</p>
