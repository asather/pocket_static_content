<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania health officials on Tuesday reported 13 deaths due to COVID-19 and 451 new cases, the 16th straight day with fewer than 1,000 cases.&nbsp;In Western Pennsylvania, there were no new deaths and 25 new cases reported.</p>
<p>The state Department of Health now reports 68,637 total cases and 5,152 deaths.</p>
<p>Allegheny County reported no new deaths due to COVID-19 and 11 new cases, according to the latest data released Tuesday by the county health department.</p>
<p>With the new figures, the county’s pandemic death toll stands at 150 deaths — 139 are confirmed and 11 are probable. However, the state lists Allegheny County with 160 deaths.</p>
<p>Since the county’s first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 14, Allegheny has had 1,816 cases — 1,709 confirmed and 107 probable cases. A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to the county.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, 319 people in Allegheny County have been hospitalized because of the highly infectious disease. Of them, 126 required a stay at the intensive care unit, and 67 required mechanical ventilation. Allegheny County has administered 28,859 tests, 20 more than the previous day. The county health department said it has the capacity to administer roughly 2,000 tests per day.</p>

<p>The continuing reduction in the number of new cases spurred Gov. Tom Wolf to reduce restrictions Friday for 16 counties mostly in the northern tier of the state, moving them from the yellow category to green and planning to move all counties out of the most strict red category by June 5. Counties in the yellow category can have some businesses open on a limited basis and those in green can have restaurants open at half their normal capacity and businesses such as salons can see customers by appointment.</p>
