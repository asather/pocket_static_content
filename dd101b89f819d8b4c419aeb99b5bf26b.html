<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mathias Barnwell had plenty of time needing to decide where he would play college football, but the 15-year-old is getting it out of the way early.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Spotsylvania, Va., native&nbsp;announced via Twitter on Monday that he’s committing to Penn State. The 6-foot-5 tight end is&nbsp;first recruit committed to Penn State’s class of 2023. He held 15 offers and picked the Nittany Lions over schools including Pitt, USC, Virginia Tech, Nebraska and Tennessee.</p>
<p>Barnwell attended the Michigan game at Beaver Stadium in 2019. A few days later, Penn State offered him a scholarship.</p>
<p>Barnwell’s impact on his Spotsylvania program was immediate. He had 10 catches for 154 yards as a freshman season and also converted six two-point conversions.</p>
