<h1>Retirement gig 'a dream come true' for Uptown native Mike Collins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — When Mike Collins retires as the longtime public-address announcer at Notre Dame Stadium this coming fall, he’ll sign off, get in his car and drive home. As for when Collins leaves his other job, as the voice of LECOM Park?</p>
<p>“I told them the only way I’m leaving is you’re taking me out on a stretcher,” Collins said. “Find some volunteers. I don’t weigh much at all. You’ll just have to drag me and fit me in the elevator.”</p>
<p>Collins, an Uptown native who has been the voice of Pirates spring training baseball for the past six years, isn’t going anywhere soon, although he is retiring from his other job, the one working for his alma mater, at the end of this upcoming football season.</p>
<p>Collins grew up a block or so from PPG Paints Arena and later moved to Ellwood City, graduating from Riverside High School before attending Notre Dame, where he graduated in 1967. This season will be Collins’ 39th behind the microphone at the iconic venue after he started in 1982, for Notre Dame Stadium’s first-ever night game.</p>
<p>“I wanted to get out with good health, on top of my game,” said Collins, who will turn 75 on March 1. “I would never want to stay over my time limit and do something that would embarrass me or my alma mater.”</p>
<p>Asked why he didn’t do another year just to make it an even 40, Collins deadpanned, “I don’t believe in artificial deadlines.”</p>
<p>No, but he does believe in doing the job well and being a little different, and one game at LECOM Park will show that he’s successful on both fronts. Collins does have a distinctive style, especially when comparing the beautiful weather here to the ugliness back home, which always draws a reaction from the crowd.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the inflection of his voice or his phrasing, Collins provides an upbeat soundtrack to Pirates spring training games, sprinkling in the perfect amount of light-hearted flair with a terrific delivery you can tell has been honed over time.</p>
<p>At Notre Dame, Collins coined the phrase “Here come the Irish” while introducing the team before a 1993 game against Florida State, something that has stuck to this day and has become something of a signature line for him.</p>
<p>“I like being quirky,” Collins said. “My wife [Melissa] will confirm that I’m quirky.”</p>
<p>It’s ironic how Collins got the Pirates job because it’s similar to how he got the Notre Dame gig — at the last minute.</p>
<p>In South Bend, longtime PA man Frank Crosiar stepped down shorty before the 1982 season. Sports information director Roger Valdiserri asked Collins if he could work the game — Notre Dame Stadium’s first-ever night game, against Michigan.</p>
<p>Collins had some hockey but never football. But by Nov. 21, after Notre Dame hosts Louisville, he will have done 233 consecutive home games.</p>
<p>“It keeps your mind going because especially in football, and even to a great degree spring training baseball, things can happen really fast,” Collins said. “You have to be on top of your game. I think I like that the most. I also like free hot dogs.”</p>
<p>Collins said he expects to feel “a little melancholy” when he ultimately steps down, but he doesn’t second-guess the decision. He’s excited to bounce back and forth between Bradenton and South Bend and continue calling games at LECOM Park.</p>
<p>“People have been asking me, ‘What are you gonna do?’ ” Collins said. “I don’t have a clue. I could check out the fall colors, I guess.</p>
<p>“But I’m at peace with my decision. Very at peace.”</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s because of the Pirates gig, where Collins gets to work for his favorite team and experience baseball’s equivalent of Pleasantville — where everything is always happy.</p>
<p>“You can leave Pittsburgh,” Collins said. “But you’re always from Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Six years ago, Mike and Melissa Collins decided to buy a winter home down here, as Mike retired from a career in broadcast journalism, where he worked as a reporter, producer, news director and anchor for a pair of South Bend, Ind., TV stations.</p>
<p>In the process of moving to Bradenton, Mike wrote a letter to Pirates director of baseball communications Jim Trdinich, offering to keep stats or call games if they ever needed help. Similar to how he got the job at Notre Dame, Collins’ predecessor quit a week before spring training.</p>
<p>“Jimmy Trdinich called me up,” Collins said. “I thought he was making up a story.”</p>
<p>That led to an “interview” of sorts, although with 30-plus years at Notre Dame, how rigorous could that have been? The funny part was the exchange with Melissa after Mike was told he got the job. It brought Mike back to when he was 5 years old, when his father took him to his first game at Forbes Field.</p>
<p>“When they offered me the job a week before the season started six years ago, I got home, and my wife was so happy,” Mike Collins said. “She said, ‘Hey, how much are they going to pay you?’ I said, ‘You know what, I forgot to ask.’ I would have done it for free, but don’t tell them that now.”</p>
<p>With only the Pirates job to focus on, Mike and Melissa Collins can spend more time with their two boys: Tim, a longtime video coordinator for Notre Dame athletics, and Matthew, a financial analyst in New York.</p>
<p>Mike can also keep his head on a swivel for the stretcher, although that’s highly unlikely to appear any time soon.</p>
<p>“When I was a kid in Pittsburgh, spring training was like a fantasy to me,” said Collins, whose best friend growing up was former Mayor Tom Murphy. “There was always something special about coming down here, then the first season we came down, a miracle occurred. It really has been a dream come true.”</p>
