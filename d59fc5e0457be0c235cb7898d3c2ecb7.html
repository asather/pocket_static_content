<p>The Allegheny County Health Department on Wednesday&nbsp;fined U.S. Steel $361,400 for over 300 air pollution and permit violations at the Clairton Coke Works dating back to October.</p>
<p>The violations outlined in the <a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Health_Department/Programs/Air_Quality/Enforcement/USSteel-Stipulated-Penalty-Demand-Letter-Q4-2019-Q1-2020.pdf" target="_blank">health department’s letter</a>&nbsp;include fines for coke oven processes such as pushing and soaking. Those fines are based on the numbers laid out in a&nbsp;June 2019 <a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Health_Department/Resources/Legal/Docket/USS-ACHD-Settlement-Agreement-and-Order-190604.pdf" target="_blank">consent agreement</a>.</p>
<p>U. S. Steel is reviewing the county’s request for payment and verifying that the data are consistent with the agreement. The company is&nbsp;“committed to working with ACHD and all stakeholders on improving air quality,” officials wrote in a release.</p>
<p>The six-figure fine follows a $743,625 penalty <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/01/17/U-S-Steel-fines-health-department-pittsburgh-clairton-coke-works-pollution/stories/202001170122" target="_blank">levied against the company</a> in January for more than 400 air pollution violations between April and September 2019.</p>
<p>“U.S. Steel’s environmental performance is continuing to improve, as a result of the hard work and dedication of our Mon Valley Works employees,” reads a statement from U.S. Steel spokesperson Meghan M. Cox. “The Clairton Plant had a record-breaking month in April for battery stack opacity compliance, which is monitored 24 hours, seven days a week.”</p>
<p>Matthew&nbsp;Mehalik, the executive director of the clean air advocacy organization Breathe Project, has been unsatisfied with the fine system that has come out of the 2019 agreement.</p>
<p>“It’s less expensive for them to pay the fine than it is to actually raise the capital and do the necessary repairs so that all of those pollution emission stop,”&nbsp;Mr. Mehalik said. The need for clean air is even more urgent during the COVID-19 crisis, since air pollution has been found to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/04/19/COVID-19-fatalities-linked-air-pollution-coronavirus-Harvard-study-PM25-particulate-allegheny-county/stories/202004140148" target="_blank">make the disease more deadly</a>.</p>
<p>“What’s required is repairing coke batteries that are very old, that leak and release emission that reach outside of what U.S. Steel is allowed to emit,” Mr. Mehalik said.</p>
<p>Per the consent agreement, 90% of the penalties, totaling $325,260, should be paid to the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2020/02/10/US-Steel-Allegheny-County-environmental-trust-fund-emissions-Mon-Valley/stories/202002100126" target="_blank">Community Benefit Trust</a>, which benefits&nbsp;Clairton, Glassport, Liberty, Lincoln and Port Vue.&nbsp;The remaining $36,140 of the potential penalties&nbsp;is to be paid to the Allegheny Clean Air Fund.</p>
<p>U.S. Steel has 30 days to make the payment.</p>
<p>The Clairton Coke Works is the largest in the country. It employs 1,200 people, and produces about 4.3 million tons of coke every year.</p>
