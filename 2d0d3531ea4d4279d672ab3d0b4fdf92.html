<p>A company that provides residential rehabilitation services for disabled adults in the Pittsburgh area has been ordered to pay $400,000 in back wages, damages and penalties for violating federal employee overtime payment and payroll recordkeeping requirements.</p>
<p>Heart II Heart LLC, which operates 13 one- and two-person homes in the area, reached the settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>
<p>The chief executive said the case arose from mistakes that she made in classifying workers.</p>
<p>An investigation by the government’s Wage and Hour Division found that Heart II Heart misclassified all workers who performed direct care. They were deemed independent contractors, resulting in the failure to pay overtime to 99 employees when they worked more than 40 hours a week.</p>
<p>The Fair Labor Standards Act requires payment of time and a half the regular rate of pay in excess of 40 hours a week.</p>
<p>Heart II Heart founder and CEO Toni Duncan, a Crafton native and psychotherapist living in Jacksonville, N.C., said the case resulted from mistakes she made in designating employees as contractors when she opened the business in 2015.</p>
<p>“It was an absolute, absolute accident,” Ms. Duncan said. “It has been ridiculous. It’s really horrible it’s turned into this. I just took a loan out and paid it. I’m so happy it’s over.”</p>
<p>Ms. Duncan was ordered to pay $182,624 in back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages. The government also assessed a civil penalty of $34,752.</p>
<p>“Employers have an obligation to pay employees in compliance with the law,” Wage and Hour District Director John DuMont said in a prepared statement.</p>
