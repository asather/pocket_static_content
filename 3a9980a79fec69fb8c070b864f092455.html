<h1>Florida Gov. DeSantis calls scientist’s data-manipulation claim a ‘nonissue’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Facing an explosive charge that his administration is manipulating coronavirus data to help make the case for reopening Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis played down the controversy Tuesday as a "nonissue."</p>
<p>Florida's COVID-19 death toll topped 2,000 Tuesday, underscoring the serious threat posed by the coronavirus and the potential consequences of not giving people accurate information on the risks involved.</p>
<p>Health experts say the milestone should serve as a sobering reminder to exercise caution as the state reopens, and DeSantis has presented his reopening plan as a "safe" and "step by step" approach. But the accusations levied by Rebekah Jones, a data expert at the Florida Department of Health, could undercut the governor's reopening push.</p>

<p>Jones wrote in an email last week that she no longer was overseeing the state's COVID-19 dashboard, which she built and managed for two months.</p>
<p>Citing "reasons beyond my division's control," Jones said her office is no longer managing the dashboard, is no longer involved in publication, fixing errors or answering questions "in any shape or form."</p>
<p>She warned that she does not know what the new team's intentions are for data access, including "what data they are now restricting."</p>
<p>"I understand, appreciate, and even share your concern about all the dramatic changes that have occurred and those that are yet to come," she wrote.</p>
<p>"As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months. After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it."</p>
<p>Jones did not respond to emailed requests to comment.</p>
<p>But DeSantis said Tuesday that Jones sent an email to her supervisor saying the comments were being misinterpreted.</p>
<p>"I don't know who she is but they gave me an email that she sent to her supervisor, said that, 'Uh-oh, I may have said something that was misrepresented,'" DeSantis said, adding Jones went on to write that: "I said they've got a team working on it now and what I meant when I said don't expect the same level of accessibility is that they are busy and can't answer every single email they get right away and that it was ridiculous that I managed to do it in the first place and that I was tired and needed a break from working two months straight."</p>
<p>DeSantis added that the state's COVID-19 dashboard is "a heck of tool" and said "I'm proud of the folks who work on it."</p>
<p>Jones told FLORIDA TODAY that she was fired on Monday. And she said in an email to the CBS12 television station in West Palm Beach that she faced blowback because she refused to "manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen."</p>
<p>The governor's office released a statement Tuesday saying Jones was terminated after a "repeated course of insubordination... including her unilateral decisions to modify the Department's COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors."</p>
<p>"Accuracy and transparency are always indispensable, especially during an unprecedented public health emergency such as COVID-19," the statement continues. "Having someone disruptive cannot be tolerated during this public pandemic, which led the Department to determine that it was best to terminate her employment."</p>
<p>Asal M. Johnson, an assistant professor of Public Health at Stetson University, told FLORIDA TODAY that she worried DOH is trying "to undermine evidence-based decision making to prioritize (the) economy."</p>
<p>Florida Democratic Party Chair Terrie Rizzo called for an independent investigation into the alleged data manipulation.</p>
<p>"Allegations that Florida's government may have tried to manipulate or alter data to make reopening appear safer is outrageous," Rizzo said. "These kinds of actions are dangerous and, frankly, should be criminal."</p>
<p>Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only statewide elected Democrat, wrote a letter to DeSantis requesting that members of his administration appear at the state's next Cabinet meeting to answer questions about the accusations levied by Jones.</p>
<p>"These actions undermine public trust in our government, are extraordinarily dangerous to public health, and are absolutely inconsistent with the transparency and accuracy that Floridians expect and deserve during this pandemic," Fried wrote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data access has not worsened further, yet, but researchers are sounding the alarm in response to Jones' email.</p>
<p>Restricting the data, UCF's Larsen said, is the equivalent of cutting off hurricane forecasts as a storm approached.</p>
<p>"It's all of us being denied access to what we need to know to be safe," she continued, adding "it's just absurd that this is being treated differently than any other threat to Floridians."</p>
<p>Professor Ben D. Sawyer, who is the director of LabX at UCF -- a team of researchers, data scientists and engineers working to understand patterns in Florida's COVID-19 data that have practical applications -- fears the data will become less available.</p>
<p>"The ability of scientists to help is directly related to how much access we're given to data," he said, warning that with less raw data, scientists will be able to produce less accurate, less useful work.</p>
<p>There's also "the worry that the scientists within government who can access the full data are being actively censored," he said."That's a real worry."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Florida Department of Health reported 55 more COVID-19 deaths Tuesday, bringing the statewide total to 2,052.</p>
<p>"In a rather short period of time we lost over 2,000 people in Florida to COVID-19, a disease we hadn't even heard of before this year," said Dr. Marissa Levine, a professor of public health and family medicine at the University of South Florida who leads the school's Center for Leadership in Public Health Practice. "As we work to reopen Florida it is critical for us all to remember that we each have a role in controlling this pandemic. Our individual and collective actions will determine the course of this pandemic in our own communities and will be the key as to whether we experience an even greater spike of disease and death in the coming months."</p>
<p>Florida health officials reported the state's first COVID-19 death on March 6, meaning it took 74 days to top 2,000 deaths.</p>
<p>The novel coronavirus has become one of the leading causes of death in Florida in just over two months. Based on 2018 death totals, 2,052 deaths would rank 16th among Florida's top causes of death, above homicides and HIV.</p>
<p>Influenza and pneumonia killed 3,082 people in Florida in 2018. The coronavirus could top that this year.</p>
<p>Florida health officials are reporting a steady stream of new coronavirus cases, and more deaths are sure to follow.</p>
<p>The state's coronavirus case total rose by 502 Tuesday to 46,944.</p>
<p>Floridians should be careful as they emerge from a monthlong lockdown, said Levine, who previously served as Virginia's state health commissioner.</p>
<p>"We know the virus is still circulating in our communities in Florida as well as around the nation and the globe," Levine said. "Although we don't have complete information, our best estimates tell us that many in our communities still remain vulnerable to the virus. Given Florida's demographics and the burden of chronic disease in the population, many of us are at high risk of serious complications and even death."</p>
<p>DeSantis began lifting Florida's lockdown earlier this month. He has focused on the fact that the state's health care system has not been overwhelmed, as some models predicted, and hospitals have plenty of available beds.</p>
<p>DeSantis touted his reopening strategy during a press conference in Orlando Monday. He has branded it the "Safe. Smart. Step by Step." plan as he seeks to avoid criticism that he is moving too fast, something public health officials are warning against.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said during a U.S. Senate hearing last week that "the consequences could be really serious" if states reopen "prematurely."</p>
<p>"I'm just looking forward to helping bring us back," DeSantis said Monday. "Obviously we still have issues with public health; that's not going to go away, but I think we have a pathway to get Florida moving again."</p>
<p>DeSantis is pushing a phased reopening that accelerated this week when gyms, libraries and museums were allowed to welcome people at 50% capacity. Restaurants and other retail establishments were allowed to increase from 25% to 50% occupancy.</p>
<p>The governor also allowed barbershops and hair salons to reopen last week, and many municipalities have reopened beaches.</p>
<p>Public health experts worry that the number of new cases and deaths could spike if the state reopens and people don't continue to practice social distancing and take other precautions.</p>
<p>"Our only tools to deal with this have remained the same: physical distancing (including cloth face coverings) and aggressive hygienic practices," Levine said. "Our ability to adapt and incorporate those practices into our everyday lives will determine the success of our reopening. I am hopeful that we will not interpret reopening as a return to the normal we once knew, but rather to a new normal that incorporates the adaptations we need to implement to protect one another."</p>
