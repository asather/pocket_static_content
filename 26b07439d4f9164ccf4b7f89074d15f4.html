<h1>Need access to resources amid COVID-19? This hotline has groceries delivered, essential items brought to your doorstep</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Not everyone is able to access the resources provided by food banks, pantries and other organizations that have stepped up to help in recent weeks as the novel coronavirus spreads.</p>
<p>Those who have struggled to find transportation options, particularly in Allegheny County, can now call the&nbsp;“Community Delivery Hotline,” created by&nbsp;Hazelwood resident Shanon Williams, 31. Whether it’s food, household items, medical supplies or baby items — county residents can call the hotline and an appointment will be arranged for a driver to meet the need, while social distancing of course.</p>
<p>“It’s great there are many food distribution days now, and some where you sit in a car and a long line, but not everyone has access to that,” said Ms. Williams, who founded a housekeeping service in 2017 and emergency assistance organization The Wellness Collective last year.&nbsp;“Even if it's a matter of ‘I have my money, but I can't get to a store,’ we wanted to make sure we helped people reach the resources that are available.”</p>
<p>The hotline was created nearly two weeks ago, and currently has about 12 active volunteer drivers who use their own vehicles to make deliveries. Ms. Williams currently handles the calls that come in, but said she hopes to start a handful of other switchboard operators next week. Service times are based on distribution sites, Ms. Williams said. Deliveries are assigned the day before to make sure enough people are on schedule to make the trips.</p>
<p>In practicing social distancing, clients are contacted by drivers as they are en route, and their items are placed in an accessible place on the property.</p>
<p>Nearly 60 people have been assisted in the roughly two weeks the hotline has been active, Ms. Williams&nbsp;said. The group has a&nbsp;waiting list with several people they are working to serve. Calls are usually taken around 11 a.m. until around 7 or 8 p.m. Ms. Williams said she hopes to&nbsp;get funds fromfoundations. The hotline&nbsp;has collaborated with several food and resource distribution sites, including Gallery on Penn, Confluence Catering, People’s Indian Restaurant, The Hill Consensus Group and her own company, The Wellness Collective.</p>
<p>“Some folks who use EBT (public assistance benefits such as food stamps) can't use it online. We have designated drivers assigned to people with EBT, so they take the cards, do the shopping and bring it back,” Ms. Williams said.&nbsp;“A lot of folks are food insecure because they can't get to what they need. We're not making any food for people. We help connect them with what they need. A lack of access to resources already existed before the virus, but it's just been exacerbated now.”</p>
<p>The Wellness Collective created an&nbsp;Allegheny County Resources &amp; Support Amid COVID-19 Facebook page last month that has garnered nearly 8,000 members. Its purpose is for community leaders and members to share resources and feedback from state and local health officials, Ms. Williams said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Community Delivery Hotline can be texted or dialed at 412-568-3579.&nbsp;</p>
