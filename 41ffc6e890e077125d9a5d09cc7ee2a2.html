<h1>Mt. Lebanon’s Equal Opportunity Board purpose under review </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Members of Mt. Lebanon’s Equal Opportunity Board questioned the municipality’s board of commissioners about the board’s role during a Sept. 8 meeting.</p>
<p>The Equal Opportunity Board was established by ordinance in 2017 and formed in 2019. It comprises five members, and its purpose, as indicted on Mt. Lebanon’s website, is to initiate, receive, investigate and pass upon complaints charging unlawful discriminatory practices taking place in Mt. Lebanon.</p>
<p>Equal Opportunity Board chairperson Kristin Meier said at the meeting the board serves to “protect classes of individuals which are not protected at state or federal levels.”</p>
<p>“The ordinance is paramount to showing this community and the region that Mt. Lebanon takes the work of equal opportunity seriously — that discrimination has no place here,” Ms. Meier said.</p>
<p>However, in July, Mt. Lebanon solicitor Phillip Weiss advised commissioners that the board is a quasi-judicial body and its work would need to be limited to waiting for any hearings that may come before it.</p>
<p>Ms. Meier and other members of the Equal Opportunity Board who spoke at the meeting were concerned the board may be dissolved as they were asked last month if they would like to continue to serve on the Equal Opportunity Board under the new quasi-judicial guise or resign their posts.</p>
<p>In an email to the Post-Gazette, Equal Opportunity Board member Josephine Posti said Mr. Weiss indicated that the Sept. 14 meeting of the Equal Opportunity Board would be its last before it became dormant, pending any hearing that might come before it.</p>
<p>She added there is currently “no mechanism for a hearing to come before the board.”</p>
<p>Commissioner Leann Foster, who serves as liaison to the board, said at the Sept. 8 meeting, “There is no intent to dissolve the Equal Opportunity Board.”</p>
<p>“There has been a legal clarification made so that the board is focused on its quasi-judicial role in the community, and that move was made in fact to support the work of the EOB,” she said.</p>
<p>“We were directed by our solicitor to ask members if they wanted to continue to serve in a quasi-judicial fashion, and if they wanted to work on diversity, equity and inclusion issues they could move over to the ad hoc commission we talked about tonight,” Ms. Foster said.</p>
<p>At the commissioners’ discussion session earlier that same evening, the board moved forward with creating an ad hoc commission — a subcommittee of the municipality’s Community Relations Board — to focus on diversity and inclusion in the community.</p>
