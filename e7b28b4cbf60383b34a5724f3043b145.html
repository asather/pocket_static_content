<h1>Downtown's Law and Finance Building hits the market</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Law and Finance Building, a fixture Downtown for nearly a century, is up for sale.</p>
<p>Built in 1928 — a year before the start of the Great Depression — the 21-story office tower at 429 Fourth Avenue is being marketed for sale by SVN Three Rivers Commercial Advisors.</p>
<p>It is seeking $12.6 million for the property, which is 82% occupied. The building, at the corner of Fourth and Cherry Way, is living up to its name with current tenants that include law firms and finance-related businesses.</p>
<p>Law and Finance is one of three buildings Downtown being put up for sale by their owner, the Ewing family. The others are 4 Smithfield, at the corner of Fort Pitt Boulevard and Smithfield Street, and 100 Ross, which is already under contract to be sold.</p>
<p>Jason Campagna, managing director of SVN Three Rivers Commercial Advisors, said the Ewings are looking to move into industrial real estate.</p>
<p>“They are shifting their portfolio to other asset types, other investment opportunities,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition to the office and finance tenants, the Law and Finance Building is home to Bruegger’s Bagels and a Central Blood Bank office.</p>
<p>The Ewing family bought the property for $3.2 million in 2006.</p>
<p>Mr. Campagna said the asking price of $12.6 million is in line on a square footage basis with other recent sales Downtown, including Convention Tower at Penn Avenue and 10th Street, which sold for $7.7 million.</p>
<p>Despite the slowdowns and construction stops caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, he is optimistic that the Law and Finance Building and 4 Smithfield will attract attention.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of people looking at these buildings equal to or greater than there were three months ago,” Mr. Campagna said.</p>
<p>The asking price for the 12-story 4 Smithfield building, with a 73% occupancy rate, is $5.85 million. It was purchased for $450,000 in 1996. It was built in 1920.</p>
