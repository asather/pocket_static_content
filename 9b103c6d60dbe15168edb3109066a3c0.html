<h1>New gun owners flood shooting ranges; restrictions at most conceal-carry offices</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The United States, including southwestern Pennsylvania, has experienced no pandemic-related panic in the streets. But at shooting ranges, gun shops and concealed-carry application centers business was booming Wednesday.</p>
<p>“We have been slammed,” said Todd Edmiston, owner of A&amp;S Indoor Pistol Range in Youngwood, Westmoreland County. “On the range it’s usually thin this time of year but there are a few more people, more first-time handgun owners asking about training. On the store side they’re buying a little bit of everything. A lot of people are talking about self-protection.”</p>
<p>At Keystone Shooting Center in Mars, Butler County, demand for indoor shooting space grew on pace with management’s concern for the welfare of its customers and staff. A salesman who spoke on the phone said the retail gun shop was “super busy, exceeding our Black Friday sales.” The store was restricted to 25 customers and rationing ammunition. Each customer was limited to two boxes of shells, or four boxes including two for immediate use on the shooting range.</p>
<p>Keystone’s 24-lane indoor shooting space is temporarily restricted to one shooter per lane. The range is equipped with a high-tech ventilation system that maintains high-quality air in each three-lane shooting bay, something owner Ty Eggemeyer suggested was coincidentally advantageous during an airborne viral pandemic.</p>
<p>“The air gets pushed beyond shooters to the front of the bay to keep them from breathing in particulates after firing,” he said. “Under normal conditions, I tell people the air in our bays is cleaner than it is in their kitchen. … Now, it’s the cleanest air you’re going to get outside a hospital.”</p>
<p>Mr. Eggemeyer said many new gun owners were scheduling shooting time.</p>
<p>“What we’re finding is first-time [gun] buyers are a high percentage of our [firing range] customers,” he said. “People who would not normally be gun owners are thinking they must now protect their homes.”</p>
<p>Official firearm sales figures at the state and national levels will be released in a few months, but a National Shooting Sports Foundation summary of gun sales processed through the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Instant Criminal Background Check System reported an increase of 300 percent Monday compared to the same day in 2019. Daily volumes are roughly double what they were a year ago. A spokeswoman said, “the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System Section remains fully operational and will continue to process requests.” The FBI processes background checks for 30 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Pennsylvania State Police said it regretted inconveniences related to the occasional crashing of the Pennsylvania Instant Check System Tuesday. The system provides required background checks for purchases, transfers, evidence returns and license-to-carry applications in the state. The PICS system processed 1,359 transactions on March 17, 2019. Between breakdowns it successfully processed 4,342 transactions Tuesday.</p>
<p>COVID-19 was posing a growing inconvenience for gun owners who want to be discreetly armed. To carry a gun out of sight, qualified gun holders are required to have a concealed-carry permit. Also called a “license to carry” in Pennsylvania, the permit costs $20, lasts for five years and is valid for six months after expiration.</p>
<p>In six of the 10 southwest Pennsylvania counties, sheriff-operated concealed-carry permit offices were closed or restricting service to new and renewing customers. Below is the license-to-carry application status in each county:</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny County</strong>: Closed for at least two weeks starting Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Armstrong:</strong> Applications through postal mail only through May 31. Customers will be notified of approval status by phone, and photos and signatures will be taken in the office. Mail a copy of driver’s license and check or money order for $20 to Armstrong County Sheriff, Armstrong County Courthouse, 500 East Market Street, Suite 106, Kittanning, PA 15601.</p>
<p><strong>Beaver:</strong> Concealed-carry applications by appointment only. Call 724-770-4614.</p>
<p><strong>Butler, Fayette, Greene, Lawrence</strong>: Open.</p>
