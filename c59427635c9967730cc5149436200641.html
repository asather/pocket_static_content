<p>Brian Dumoulin and John Marino are back. The two injured defensmen returned to the Penguins lineup Tuesday against the Ottawa Senators at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
<p>Their return came <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/03/02/penguins-injury-updates-brian-dumoulin-john-marino-losing-streak/stories/202003020127" target="_blank">not a moment too soon</a> for the Penguins, who entered the day on a six-game losing streak. Without two of their top defensemen in Dumoulin and Marino, they have been forced to use Jack Johnson on their top defensive pair and rely on Chad Ruhwedel, Juuso Riikola and Zach Trotman in recent games.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan reunited Dumoulin with All-Star defensemen Kris Letang on the top pair in Dumoulin’s first game back.</p>
<p>“They’re a little different in their strengths,” he said. “I just think Dumo is a really good defending defenseman. They’re both mobile guys; they can really skate. Dumo’s a guy that can get back to pucks quickly and makes a good outlet pass. I think it allows Tanger to be a little bit more instinctive with his play.”</p>
<p>Dumoulin has been sidelined since undergoing ankle surgery Dec. 1. Sullivan was asked if the Penguins would “ease” Dumoulin back in with fewer minutes.</p>
<p>“In theory, you’d like to ease him back in, but I don’t even know if that’s possible with the way today’s game is being played,” he said. “These guys are ready to play. They’ve been in [three] practices. They’re in great shape. Our strength and conditioning guys have done a real good job making sure that they’re ready.”</p>
<p>Marino, who had surgery Jan. 10 to fix broken bones in his face, had missed the previous 11 games. The rookie partnered up with Marcus Pettersson, with Johnson and Justin Schultz on the third pair.</p>
<p>Ruhwedel and Riikola were both healthy scratches Tuesday. Trotman, meanwhile, was sent down to the team’s American Hockey League affiliate Monday.</p>
<p>In other news, Sullivan said Brandon Tanev is sick, sidelining the winger against the Senators. Rookie Anthony Angello replaced him in the lineup.</p>
