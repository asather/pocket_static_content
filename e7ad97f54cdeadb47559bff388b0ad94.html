<h1>Hostile response: Mike Pompeo blasts reporter over tough questions </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s hostile response to tough questions from a National Public Radio host and the State Department’s subsequent removal of an NPR reporter from covering his trip to Europe and Central Asia is an attack on the quality journalism Americans deserve.</p>
<p>Two days after a clash with NPR host Mary Louise Kelly, NPR correspondent Michele Kelemen was denied her turn as a pool reporter on the weeklong trip that began Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelly asked Mr. Pompeo why he hadn’t done more to defend Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who was ousted from her post last year.</p>
<p>After saying, “I’ve defended every single person on this team,” Mr. Pompeo was asked for specific remarks defending her, a legitimate question. He cut off the interview, and, according to Ms. Kelly, cursed at her for asking about Ukraine.</p>
<p>Mr. Pompeo then released a statement on State Department letterhead that blasted Ms. Kelly as a liar for asking him about Ukraine after agreeing not to do so.</p>
<p>Emails between Ms. Kelly and the Pompeo aide who set up the interview prove Ms. Kelly committed no deception, showing the two agreeing on an open-ended conversation including Ukraine.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump, unfortunately, congratulated Mr. Pompeo on Tuesday at the White House, calling his rudeness to Ms. Kelly “impressive,” and saying, “I think you did a good job on her.”</p>
<p>The reaction of Mr. Pompeo and the president to Ms. Kelly’s tough questioning disrespects not only NPR and its employees but the American people. Journalists are tasked with holding public officials accountable; the Trump administration needs to accept that and answer uncomfortable questions with grace and civility.</p>
