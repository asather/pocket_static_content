<h1>Pittsburgh Public Schools' students celebrate graduation at drive-in ceremony</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rather than walking across a stage, shaking hands and smiling for photos to commemorate high school graduation, students this spring turned to virtual ceremonies and socially distant celebrations.</p>
<p>On Saturday, students graduating from Pittsburgh Public Schools celebrated another way —&nbsp;drive-in style.</p>
<p>From their cars, students accepted congratulations on their behalf and honked their support for fellow classmates as speakers reminded students to stick to their future plans, regardless of COVID-19-related disruptions.</p>
<p>“You guys have missed an awful lot but I’m here to challenge this group...you cannot let these trials define you and your ability to contribute to society,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said in a video message to the students. “Let the standard remain the standard. Be the squeaky wheel. So that your big picture opportunities and goals don’t fall victim to these short-term circumstances.”</p>
<p>“It puts the plan on hold, it doesn’t derail the plan,” said Saleem Ghubril, executive director of the Pittsburgh Promise, an organization that funds scholarships for post-secondary education and works with students to form post-graduation plans.</p>
<p>Graduating students from Pittsburgh Public Schools were invited to participate in the drive-in style event, which was hosted by The Pittsburgh Promise and the Penguins at the PPG Paints Arena Saturday.</p>
<p>Though not an official graduation ceremony, the&nbsp;event replaced a similar annual celebration that usually takes place at Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Hall &amp; Museum in Oakland and is usually a part of the student’s school day, Mr. Ghubril said.</p>
<p>Every year, the event serves as one of the few chances students from across PPS gather together, he said. This year, it doubled as a reunion for kids who hadn’t seen their friends in months and a celebration for making it through a particularly challenging end to high school.</p>
<p>“It was just really nice being here and hearing about how people believe in us,” said Joseph Jones, a recent graduate of Taylor Allderdice High School in Squirrel Hill.</p>
<p>“And also kind of telling us that this is a [expletive] up situation but we know you will get through it,” he said. “That’s nice, having more people say that.”</p>
<p>Mr. Jones said he was “not as on the ball” with his schoolwork as he normally would have been.</p>
<p>Being cooped up in the same room for eight hours and lacking the stress (that serves as motivation, he said) of the actual school building, made it hard to focus. Even more so during long Advanced Placement exams where he had to strain to remember any material before the pandemic hit in full force in March.</p>
<p>Brothers Teshir Aliston and Khalil Schaeffer agreed that finishing high school online was difficult, dubbing it tedious and annoying.</p>
<p>For reasons unclear to them, teachers would block assignments or say an assignment wasn’t finished when they believed it was. If they ran into technical problems when submitting their work, the teachers would dock them points for being late. If they reached out to teachers with questions, they sometimes didn’t hear back for weeks, they said.</p>
<p>The brothers are happy to be done and moving on to future plans —&nbsp;two-years at Community College of Allegheny County to study game design before transferring to a four-year university for Mr. Aliston and enrolling at Carlow University to study early childhood education for Mr. Schaeffer.</p>
<p>Anticipating that COVID-19 would make an already difficult time even harder for students, the Pittsburgh Promise hired three new staffers and raised more than one million dollars for a COVID-specific fund.</p>
<p>Those funds are earmarked to help students who are food insecure, students who need mental health services and students who need help paying for college courses.</p>
<p>The money is meant for students who were counting on a summer job to pay the bill for courses they already completed this spring and are now having trouble finding work or for students who have to retake a course because COVID-19 impacted their success, Mr. Ghubril said.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Promise wanted to help students furnish their dorm rooms and provided each student at Saturday’s event with about $120 worth of new bedding, including a pillow, pillow case, extra-long sheets and a mattress cover.</p>
<p>The bedding came from Duquesne-based American Textile, Mr. Ghubril said.</p>
<p>In the past 11 years, the Promise has given out $145 million in scholarships to 10,000 kids, he said.</p>
<p>The graduating students of this year’s class had 165 different post-grad plans, ranging from taking a gap year to going to beauty school to attending a four-year college to enlisting in the military.</p>
<p>Some students were staying close by and attending Chatham University, Point Park University or the University of Pittsburgh while others were planning to travel as far away as Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Sophie Levitt, who is planning to attend The College of Wooster in Ohio, said her graduation from Obama Academy in East Liberty, didn’t feel real until she received her diploma.</p>
<p>Before the drive-in celebration, Ms. Levitt had participated in a virtual ceremony and a drive-by parade, where seniors decorated their cars and drove by family and friends while teachers read their names and future plans.</p>
<p>The parade was such a success that families are requesting it become an annual tradition, said Karen Levitt, Sophie’s mother.</p>
<p>One of 11 valedictorians in her class, Sophie gave a speech during her school’s virtual graduation. She focused her message on embracing future endeavors, channeling a motto from the school’s former principal: “whatever you do in life, do it so well that no one living, no one dead or yet to be born can do it any better,” she said.</p>
<p>Speaking during a virtual ceremony was surreal, she said, but probably easier —&nbsp;and cooler — than speaking in front of hundreds of people on a hot summer day. “I don’t know how I would have done that,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones, from Allderdice, is attending Gettysburg College in the fall. The school recently announced the students would be able to come to campus next semester for a mix of online and in-person classes.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones is excited while his mother, Yasmin Dada-Jones, is excited and nervous at the same time.</p>
<p>“I’m just a cauldron of mixed emotions right now,” she said.</p>
<p>To celebrate the end of high school, the family had planned trips to Japan and Egypt, both of which were cancelled as a result of the global health crisis.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Jones is planning a different kind of trip with his father. This time, they’re heading to Delaware.</p>
