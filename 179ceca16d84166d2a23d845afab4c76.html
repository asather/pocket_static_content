<h1>Pirates on pause: What is the ceiling for the outfield in 2020?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With MLB hoping to return soon, the Post-Gazette’s Jason Mackey and Mike Persak will analyze 20 issues related to the Pirates — think 20 Thoughts or questions about the team. They’ll run each weekday online through May 22 and will appear in print (or via other P-G digital platforms) on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</em></p>
<p>For the first time since 2011, the Pirates will be without Starling Marte.</p>
<p>In his wake is a mixed bag of outfielders on the Pirates’ big-league roster. Some have a proven pedigree, some have dealt with injuries, some have both.</p>
<p>So what is the best case scenario for the remaining group? Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>We’ll start with left fielder Bryan Reynolds, who is the obvious bright spot. The 25-year-old led the Pirates in batting average (.314) and on-base percentage (.377) in 2019, finished second on the team in defensive runs saved (5) and finished fourth in the National League in Rookie of the Year voting. He is now one of the team’s most valuable building blocks.</p>
<p>Reynolds, if he can remain healthy and solid, figures to be the Pirates’ everyday left fielder. There’s obviously a chance he experiences a sophomore slump, but given that we’re dealing with the outfield’s ceiling here, it’s fair to expect him to be a .300 hitter again. In fact, if we’re talking best possible outcome, you could see Reynolds bumping his home run numbers up from 16 to the low 20s and knocking in a few more RBIs than the 68 he had last season.</p>
<p>The rest of the group is where things get interesting.</p>
<p>Jarrod Dyson, 35, is the presumed starter in center field. He has had injury troubles, undergoing two surgeries since he left the Kansas City Royals in 2016. His numbers have also depreciated a bit since then, coming up short of the high standard he set with the Royals.</p>
<p>He bounced back a little in 2019, hitting just .230 but walking at an above-average 10.4% clip and leading the Diamondbacks with 30 stolen bases in 130 games. Dyson can at least fill that base-stealing role that Marte had taken on in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>What hasn’t wavered is Dyson’s value in the field. He finished second in Arizona in both defensive runs saved and defensive wins above replacement, with 14 and 1.4, respectively. Those marks would have tied for the team lead on the Pirates.</p>
<p>Dyson has a lot to prove. He admitted in spring training that the free agent market wasn’t plentiful for him this offseason, and he’s on a one-year deal in Pittsburgh. The ideal scenario for him would be to improve his hitting a bit, maintain that walk rate, wreak havoc on the basepaths and do what he always does in the field.</p>
<p>What this may all come down to, though, is right field. Gregory Polanco is healthy again after playing just 42 games in 2019, but what exactly does that mean?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/27/pittsburgh-pirates-2020-season-colin-moran-gregory-polanco/stories/202004270012" target="_blank">As Jason Mackey noted on Monday</a>, the Pirates could use what power is left in that smooth, left-handed swing. The question is, how patient people will be with half measures? In Polanco’s best season, he hit 23 homers, and he has never hit for a particularly high average. What’s more, the speed and base-stealing factor that Polanco had a few years ago hasn’t resurfaced since 2016.</p>
<p>In the field, things were bad for Polanco in 2019. In just 42 games, he was worth minus-5 runs saved and accrued a mnus-0.7 defensive WAR.</p>
<p>But we’re working in best case scenarios here, and while it’s hard to see Polanco putting together a career year, it’s not crazy to hope he’ll be better. With that, it’s fair to say that an optimist could hope to pencil Polanco in for a .250-ish season at the plate with a regression to the mean in terms of power. He’s only ever had a positive defensive WAR once in his career, so those numbers may be in Polanco’s past, but it’s fair to expect him to at least look a little more comfortable out there with a healthy throwing shoulder.</p>
<p>Guillermo Heredia and Jason Martin will also factor into this picture, though it’s unclear exactly how. They figure to be the obvious fill-in, pinch-hit type of guys in this scenario. Both of their best major league seasons at the plate came with .250 batting averages and little-to-no home run power. Heredia’s best was in 2016 with the Seattle Mariners, and Martin’s was last season in an up-and-down year with the Pirates that ended in shoulder surgery.</p>
<p>Martin’s ceiling is likely higher, given that he’s just 24 years old and could possibly play a part in the Pirates’ long-term future. Whatever either can positively contribute this year would be a welcome sign for the Pirates because depth is badly needed in the outfield.</p>
<p>All of that is to say that the outfield is a little bit hard to predict. Reynolds should be good, and you ideally know what you’re getting out of Dyson. The rest may very well hinge on what Polanco does. If he struggles or if injuries flares up again, then Martin and Heredia are thrust into more prominent roles. But if Polanco finds his footing again, then the outfield becomes much easier to figure out for the Pirates.</p>
<p><strong>STATISTICALLY SPEAKING:&nbsp;</strong>Jarrod Dyson is one of only three players to finish in the top 10 in the MLB in stolen bases, along with Billy Hamilton and Dee Gordon</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THIS:&nbsp;</strong>The last Pirate to finish as high as fourth in NL Rookie of the Year voting was Jung Ho-Kang in 2015.</p>
<p><strong>THEY SAID IT:&nbsp;</strong>”We are watching video of [Polanco] throwing both short and distances that stretch it out that the outfielder needs to do. We’re very encouraged with how Gregory is taking advantage of his time.” — Pirates director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk</p>
