<h1>Public will get chance to voice opinions on future of Columbus statue in Schenley Park</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Art Commission unanimously voted on Wednesday to schedule a special hearing for the public to voice their opinions on the potential removal of the Christopher Columbus statue in Schenley Park.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto asked the commission in a letter Tuesday to begin a public review to determine the future of the statue.</p>
<p>The statue, which was erected in Schenley Park in 1958, was vandalized in 2010, 2017 and most recently again in June and July as part of nationwide protests against monuments honoring Columbus.</p>
<p>After the statue was vandalized in June, an online petition was created calling for its removal.</p>
<p>Following a discussion about the procedure of buying, placing and removing city-owned art — which included an argument between some commissioners and Assistant City Solicitor Lorraine Mackler on the autonomy of the commission — the commission approved the special hearing, which will allow members of the public to voice their opinions to the commission directly.</p>
<p>A date for the new hearing was not immediately available, though commissioner Andrew Moss commented that he hoped it would happen within the month if possible.</p>
<p>Once the review process is completed, Mr. Peduto has requested a final report, including the public comments and a final recommendation from the commission.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto also called upon the commission in 2018 to offer a recommendation of what to do with the controversial Stephen Foster statue in Oakland.</p>
<p>That statue was ultimately removed after unanimous approval by the commission.</p>
