<h1>There is water on Mars! SodaStream Super Bowl promotion promises bubbles for borough residents</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The citizens of Moon Township are going to be so jealous they weren’t picked for this.</p>
<p>In an out-of-this-world promotion, SodaStream is offering a free device to any resident of Mars, Pa. who tweets at <a href="https://twitter.com/SodaStreamUSA" target="_blank">@SodaStreamUSA</a>&nbsp;any time on Super Bowl Sunday.</p>
<p>As part of the promotion, the fizzy water company has a 30-second ad that will run during the Chiefs-49ers game, featuring a “Mars exploration.”</p>
<p>The borough of Mars, in southern Butler County, has a population of around 1,700. Anyone tweeting must prove residency in order to take delivery of a SodaStream, which is a do-it-yourself way of making carbonated beverages.</p>
<p>The offer also extends to others in the Mars area, which includes Adams Township, parts of Seven Fields Borough, Callery Borough, a bit of Allegheny County and possibly other areas in the 16046 ZIP code umbrella.</p>
<p>Bill Nye, known as&nbsp;“The Science Guy” in some quarters, is part of the promotion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Along with providing a great way to have all the sparkling water you need, SodaStream is using this platform to bring attention to an alternative to plastic bottles in a playful approachable way,” he said in a statement.&nbsp;“In this spot, we even celebrate exploring Mars!</p>
<p>“We’re living at a pivotal time. We have to preserve Earth’s environment, and water is our most precious resource. The sooner we switch to more sustainable, everyday water options like SodaStream, the better.”</p>
<p>Mars’ mayor, Gregg&nbsp;Hartung, said the borough is “excited to have Bill Nye the Science Guy say something about Mars.”</p>
<p>A life-long resident, the mayor said he’s used to the “Oh, I guess there really is water on Mars” sort of humor associated with small towns that have unusual names. Mars takes a certain pride in its name; why else would there be a statue of a flying saucer at the intersection of Pittsburgh Street and Grand Avenue?</p>
<p>Mr. Hartung said he plans to take advantage of the promotion&nbsp;— his daughter, Maria Hartung will tweet for him.</p>
<p>But Bonnie Forsythe, the borough’s secretary-treasurer, said she cannot.&nbsp;“Sadly, I don’t live in Mars.” Given her daily service to Mars, perhaps someone can make some sort of galactic exception.</p>
<p>SodaStream&nbsp;is carrying a full-page ad in the Butler Eagle on Sunday announcing the promotion.</p>
