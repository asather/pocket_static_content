<h1>Joe Starkey: Resurgent Kevin Colbert still the right man for Steelers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>He’s not perfect. No general manager, in any sport, is perfect. None is close.</p>
<p>I could point to several puzzling moves from the past year alone that prove Kevin Colbert makes mistakes — and this was a resurgent year for him. A renaissance year, even.</p>
<p>He signed Donte Moncrief.</p>
<p>He left the Steelers incredibly vulnerable at free safety to begin the season, which is why Kam Kelly was matching wits with Tom Brady in Foxborough.</p>
<p>He left the Steelers incredibly vulnerable at tight end, which seemed obvious from a million miles away (when Goal-Line Grimble is your primary backup, you got problems).</p>
<p>But in judging Colbert, or any general manager, a compartmentalized view often delivers a false read. The big picture provides truth. And while Colbert should never be exempt from criticism, his long game speaks for itself.</p>
<p>It speaks to him being one of the very best in the business, actually, and Steelers fans should feel lucky that he is sticking around.</p>
<p>That became official Wednesday, after periodic speculation that Colbert, 63, might retire or move on to another challenge. His <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/05/kevin-colbert-contract-extension-steelers/stories/202002050150" target="_blank">new one-year deal</a> — he prefers to go year-by-year these days — will take him through the 2021 draft.</p>
<p>To truly appreciate Colbert, one must go back to the dawn of the millennium, when he was hired. It was a tumultuous time in Steelers history. The team was coming off consecutive losing seasons for the first time in more than a decade. The coach and general manager were at each other’s throats.</p>
<p>Bill Cowher won that power struggle over Tom Donahoe, who was forced to resign. Seven candidates were interviewed to replace Donahoe, and the Steelers, as usual, made the right choice.</p>
<p>Just look at their record since Colbert climbed aboard.</p>
<p>This is a vicious, win-at-all-costs business, remember. A bottom-line business. In Colbert’s first 10 years — the 2000s — these were the NFL’s four winningest teams:</p>
<p>1. Indianapolis: 115-45</p>
<p>2. New England: 112-48</p>
<p>3. Steelers: 103-56-1</p>
<p>4. Philadelphia: 103-56-1</p>
<p>In Colbert’s next 10 years — the 2010s — these were the NFL’s four winningest teams:</p>
<p>1. New England: 125-35-0</p>
<p>2. Green Bay: 102-56-2</p>
<p>3. Steelers: 102-57-1</p>
<p>4. Seattle: 100-59-1</p>
<p>How’s that for consistency? Now consider that because the Steelers have been so successful — one losing season in 20 years — they usually draft low, and yet Colbert almost always constructs a roster more talented than most.</p>
<p>Try to find somebody who matters in the NFL and ask them what they think of Colbert. I promise they’ll tell you he ranks with the best in his field.</p>
<p>None of this makes for incendiary talk-show fodder. It’s just true. And yes, it’s also true the Steelers need to get back to the business of winning playoff games, though it’s instructive to remember that Super Bowl wins aren’t easy to come by.</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs just went 50 years between them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Colbert also has proven to be adaptable. As mentioned earlier, this was a resurgent year. A different year. The Steelers stepped out of their comfort zone more than once.</p>
<p>They threw big money (for them) at a free agent, and cornerback Steven Nelson repaid them with excellence.</p>
<p>They moved way up in the draft to satisfy a position of great need (inside linebacker).</p>
<p>They traded a first-round pick — something they hadn’t done since Colbert was a 12-year-old at North Catholic (or headed there, anyway) — and came up with a gem in Minkah Fitzpatrick.</p>
<p>Most amazing of all, Colbert was able to procure something of value for the rapidly deflating balloon that was Antonio Brown.</p>
<p>Oh, and the general manager bet on Bud Dupree and looked pretty smart in doing so. Dupree is paired with T.J. Watt, a bona fide star Colbert snagged with the 28th pick in 2017 (right after the Cleveland Browns took tight end David Njoku, I feel compelled to add).</p>
<p>Colbert was quoted thusly in a team-released statement Wednesday: “It’s hard to quantify how fortunate I am to have been a part of this organization for the past 20 years.”</p>
<p>Yes, well, the organization has been pretty fortunate, too.</p>
