<h1>Pittsburgh ad agency Marc USA merges with two companies</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh-based advertising agency Marc USA has merged with two agencies, one in South Carolina and another in Alabama, to form marketing company 9Rooftops.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;" data-mce-mark="1">The combined firm will boast over 300 employees, with around 200 at Marc USA’s Station Square office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;" data-mce-mark="1">The name signifies the number of offices between Marc USA and BFG Communications, based in Hilton Head, S.C., and BLR Further in Birmingham, Ala.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Kevin Meany, BFG founder and now CEO of 9Rooftops, said each of the agencies brings something to the merger: Marc USA offers a large media group, while BFG offers its in-house content studio and BLR provides a health care specialty, now known as 9Rooftops Health.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Though they have openings to fill in data analytics, human resources and copywriting, Mr. Meany said the company hasn’t planned any major staff moves post-merger.</span></p>
<p>Locations in Pittsburgh, Chicago and Hilton Head will serve as the main company offices.</p>
<p>In a marketing and advertising industry that’s been decimated by the pandemic, 9Rooftops’ leaders feel lucky to have maintained the clients they have.</p>
<p>“If you’re in an agency that’s heavy in retail or heavy with sports teams, it’s going to be a tough go right now,” Mr. Meany said.</p>
<p>9Rooftops’ combined list of clients includes Honest Tea, Qdoba, Barilla, Conair Man, Turner Broadcasting, South Carolina Tourism, Bellin Health System, Carle Health, Glanbia, Coca-Cola and the Pennsylvania and Maryland state lottery agencies.</p>
<p><span>Mr. Meany said COVID-19 has altered the market for consumers, bringing new challenges for advertising companies.</span></p>
<p>“We’re in a market where buying patterns have changed, the competitive landscape has changed for retailers, and there’s a fear in the market by many consumers. Most brands require a complete reset at this point,” he said.</p>
