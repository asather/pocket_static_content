<h1>Residential power usage up as employees continue to work from home</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With more people working from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic, residential power usage is up 5-10 percent, according to a spokeswoman for the Duquesne Light Company.</p>
<p>However, commercial and industrial power usage is down about 15-20 percent as people continue to work remotely from home instead of large office buildings and factories which require massive central air conditioners for workers and sensitive equipment such as computer terminals.</p>
<p>Despite the two trends seemingly balancing out, scores of Pittsburgh residents have been left in the dark in recent days as a heat wave continues to grip the region. Several hundred Pittsburghers were left without power on Tuesday after nearly 4,000 residents in neighborhoods such as Bloomfield and Lawrenceville experienced a blackout on Monday.</p>
<p>Temperatures are forecast to reach the mid-90s at least until Saturday, according to the National Weather Service’s Pittsburgh office. Duquesne Light spokeswoman Ashley Macik said it’s not uncommon to see rolling power outages during such extreme heat waves.</p>
<p>“With the increase in power and temperatures not dipping below 70, even overnight, the system is not able to recover as quickly as it normally would. In this heat wave, it’s running at high levels continuously 24/7,” she said.</p>
<p>Air conditioners draw far more energy than other appliances and, as people stay home to work, they keep their homes cooler than they would if they were at the office all day, Ms. Macik said. The extra draw is a big strain on the electrical grid.</p>
<p>Duquesne Light is addressing the blackout problem by increasing staffing and adding extra shifts to Field Operation teams, which work outside to restore power. In the long run, the company is looking to add more troubleshooter positions.</p>
<p>The company recommends residents turn their thermostats up to 78 degrees from 2-6 p.m., peak hours for the electrical grid, to draw less electricity and help prevent rolling blackouts.</p>
<p>To prepare for a blackout, residents should keep cell phones charged, maintain an emergency preparedness kit with water, non-perishable food and a battery-powered radio, and to avoid opening refrigerator and freezer doors to keep food fresh.&nbsp;</p>
