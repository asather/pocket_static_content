<h1>Dave DeCastro, Diontae Johnson miss Steelers practice; Stefen Wisniewski in line to start</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers will be featuring two new starters on the offensive line and a third player in a new position Monday night when they open the season at the New York Giants.</p>
<p>David DeCastro did not practice again Thursday and is not expected to play. Stefen Wisniewski would start for DeCastro in his first game with the Steelers, joined by new right tackle Zach Banner. Matt Feiler, who played right tackle the past two seasons, is now the starting left guard.</p>
<p>“I think anytime you have a piece that is changed up front there is always that little bit of angst, if you will, at least from my perspective,” offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner said Thursday after practice. “I don’t think it’s from their perspective. They work together. They have unique communication. [Maurkice] Pouncey ties that whole thing together. I think if you would have said Pounce wasn’t sitting there in the middle, I’d probably say my feelings would be a lot greater for me. But I do know these guys are preparing themselves, and they’ve done a nice job.”</p>
<p>Banner has worked with DeCastro, Wisniewski and rookie Kevin Dotson throughout the shortened training camp. He said he has gained a comfort level with Wisniewski over the past few days.</p>
<p>“When you talk about Stefen as a player, he knows all of his X’s and O’s,” Banner said. “He’s going on 11 years. It’s crazy. He’s a smart guy. He works really hard and communicates really, really well. We’re both excited. He texted me congratulations when it was announced. It’s one of those things where you put your hard hat on and show up to work.”</p>
<p><strong>Johnson out</strong></p>
<p>Receiver Diontae Johnson was the only other player on the injury report for the Steelers. Johnson is listed with a foot injury.</p>
<p>If Johnson was unable to play, the Steelers would have to adjust with their other young receivers. It would mean more playing time for James Washington and possibly rookie second-round pick Chase Claypool.</p>
<p>“Chase is unique physically for the position,” Fichtner said. “To his credit, he did the necessary things he had to do in the offseason. He didn’t get a chance to do it with us. He didn’t get a chance to work with him in the weight room or on the grass. He learned how to be a professional prior to getting here. He came into camp in awesome shape. His body hasn’t failed him. His mind hasn’t failed him because he’s conditioned. He’s put himself in the talk of being useful for us early in the season and a lot earlier than you would probably expect.</p>
