<h1>Large majority of PPS union staff support police in schools, survey shows</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The union that represents staff of the Pittsburgh Public Schools on Thursday released the results of a survey about police in schools that showed its members strongly believe the district should keep its officers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 1,300 members of the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers responded to the survey between June 25 and June 30, and 96.1% of them said&nbsp;police should be not eliminated from the city’s schools.</p>
<p>“I am gratified to note that so many of our members recognized the value of our school police officers,” PFT president Nina Esposito-Visgitis said in a statement. “Our survey is an opportunity to continue the needs-based conversation we have begun between our members, parents, students and the diverse communities we serve.”</p>
<p>The conversation around removing police from schools is not new, but it has gained traction in the weeks since a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd. The school districts in Minneapolis and other major cities across the country have cut ties with police departments since Mr. Floyd’s death in May.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/06/12/Coalition-calls-for-removal-of-police-from-Pittsburgh-Public-Schools/stories/202006120115" target="_blank">A coalition of more than 10 social justice and civil liberties groups</a> in June called upon the Pittsburgh Public Schools to remove police officers and exchange them with more counselors, nurses and mental health professionals. The coalition said the district should work to combat the school-to-prison pipeline by putting more focus on restorative-justice interventions.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools employs 20 police officers who are not armed but have arresting powers. The district’s police officers are represented by the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers.</p>
<p>The federation represents about 2,400 teachers, more than 500 paraprofessionals and other staff members in the district.</p>
<p>While those who responded to the survey showed strong support for school police, they also asked for more support for the social and emotional needs of students. Respondents said they would like more counselors, social workers, nurses and mental health staff, as well as community mental health and resiliency services.</p>
<p>They also sought full-staff training in&nbsp;de-escalation and trauma informed care,&nbsp;supports and training for the implementation of restorative practices and anti-racism training and counseling.</p>
<p>A total of 1,340 federation members responded to the survey. Of them, 925 said they worked in a school that did not have an officer assigned to it. Nearly 45% of the 925 said their school should have an officer assigned to it; 51.5% said their school does not require one, but schools that need an officer should have one.</p>
<p>Other results from the survey showed that slightly more than 80% of the respondents said they felt their students were safe in school every day, regardless of whether an officer was present.&nbsp;About 96% of respondents who had police at their school every day said the officer enhanced their feeling of safety.&nbsp;And&nbsp;94% of respondents believed school officers treated students, staff and visitors with respect.</p>
<p>Public comments during a school board meeting last week reflected a divide in the community over the subject of police in Pittsburgh schools.</p>
<p>Many asked what a school was supposed to do in the face of an immediate violent threat if an officer was not nearby. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/06/23/Pittsburgh-Public-Schools-district-board-hearing-remove-police-officers/stories/202006230116" target="_blank">Several officers also addressed the school board</a> and told members about the relationships they have formed with students and the efforts they make to avoid filing charges against students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others, though, said school police disproportionately file charges against Black students and are not equipped to deal with students suffering from mental health issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>School board members Devon Taliaferro and Pam Harbin last week <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/06/24/Pittsburgh-Public-Schools-board-transparency-police-officers-district-safety/stories/202006240146" target="_blank">introduced a resolution seeking more transparency</a> from the district’s department of safety. The resolution, however, did not ask for police to be removed from schools.</p>
<p>Ms. Esposito-Visgitis defended school police in comments before the school board last week, saying&nbsp;calls to remove police from schools are “wrongheaded and [ignore] the progressive and diverse safety department PPS has.”</p>
<p>“Our police know our students, have specialized training in de-escalation techniques and restorative practices and are a vital part of our school communities,” she said. “They do not carry firearms. They enhance safety in our schools by being problem solvers, risk managers and an overwhelming force for good.”</p>
