<h1>Walkabout: Seeing positivity even in homelessness</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last autumn, Scott Haushalter walked out of Bethlehem Haven in Uptown with the aid of a walker.</p>
<p>He had spent eight weeks in the hospital with an aneurysm and needed two surgeries and seven weeks in respite care. During that time, his landlord threw his stuff out. Scott&nbsp;hadn’t been able to pay his rent while he was incapacitated.</p>
<p>He had nothing and no place to go. He had lived for years with his daughter, but days before he was hospitalized, he said, “I had to get out of there.”</p>
<p>He didn’t want to talk about that situation. But he was willing to talk about the seven months he has spent living in a tent.</p>
<p>My long-time friend Randy Strothman, a photographer and videographer, befriended Scott last autumn in Allegheny Commons Park and stayed in touch with him. Randy told me that Scott impressed him, even inspired him, because of his gratitude and generous worldview.</p>
<p>Since we all live in different parts of the North Side, the park was where Randy and I waited for Scott on a beautiful day last week. He pedaled up on a bicycle, wearing a Pirates jacket over a white hoodie. He shrugged out of his backpack after pulling up his mask.</p>
<p>He apologized for being late. He had stopped for something to eat at the Light of Life Rescue Mission.</p>
<p>“There are so many great organizations that give you food, so if you’re on the North Side and you’re hungry, you’re lazy,” he said, citing the generosity of the Light of Life, New Hope Church, the Salvation Army, and a group of high schoolers and a congregation in Mars that bring food to the park on weekends.</p>
<p>Early in his homelessness, he found a secluded wooded area in which to pitch the tent that he got from Operation Safety Net. It was too cold, so he found other accommodations.</p>
<p>“Right now, I am living in an abandoned house” in Perry South, Scott said.</p>
<p>He lives in his tent in the house.</p>
<p>He said he rejected the places that Bethlehem Haven and social workers from UPMC had suggested he could live in. They were all far away.</p>
<p>“The North Side is my comfort zone. I didn’t think I could survive in any of those other places,” he said.</p>
<p>He grew up in Perry South and graduated from Oliver High School. He had worked more than 30 years in construction, and also as a state constable and a bail bondsman. He earned a regular paycheck but said he was unhappy and, at times, depressed.</p>
<p>He still gets depressed, he said, “but not like everything is hopeless.” In fact, he said, being homeless “is one of the best things that has happened to me.”</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>“It has restored my faith in human nature,” he said. “Because of people like him,” he said, motioning at Randy. “I saw how loving and caring some people still are. I’ve learned a lot about myself, too. I’ve learned how to be more resourceful.”</p>
<p>A minister gave him a solar light and battery pack so that he can have light in his tent. An ex-girlfriend with whom he has remained friends bought him his cellphone.</p>
<p>“I watch my phone a lot,” Scott said. “There are movies on YouTube. I stay to myself, away from all the trouble and the drug use.”</p>
<p>Since his surgeries last year, he continues to deal with congestive heart failure and other conditions that he seems to be defying. He is 57.</p>
<p>“Since I started riding the bike, I am in better shape,” he said. “I ride at least 20 miles a day, and 50 isn’t a stretch.”</p>
<p>He even cut his own hair and beard with an electric razor recently, thanks to his solar battery pack.</p>
<p>He began rummaging around in his backpack.</p>
<p>“My backpack is like my house. I have everything in it,” he said.</p>
<p>He pulled out the battery pack, which looks like a cellphone, its screen filled with solar cells.</p>
<p>For many weeks, Scott could be seen near an exit ramp off Interstate 279 in East Deutschtown. He panhandled and also cleaned up litter.</p>
<p>On days when he made more panhandling than he needed, he said he shared it with people on the streets or in shelters.</p>
<p>As he filled garbage bags with litter, drivers would stop and hand him money. One driver handed him work gloves, another gave him garbage bags. One gave him hand warmers. One handed him a bag of food from Red Lobster.</p>
<p>“A lot of police officers would drive by and say, ‘Be careful,’ and ‘You’ve made it look nice,’ but two cops single us out,” he said. “They hate the homeless. One fined me for panhandling and obstructing traffic. How can I obstruct traffic at a stop sign?”</p>
<p>The fine was $640.</p>
<p>“He said he would keep fining me until he got me in jail,” Scott said.</p>
<p>Fining people for panhandling is an exercise in futility and inhumanity. If a guy wants to ask for money and another person wants to give him some, that’s a matter between two people. Panhandling is a way for people who have nothing to make a little something. A person who doesn’t need money isn’t likely to humble himself in this way anyway.</p>
<p>Scott said he no longer panhandles because he believes the cop wants to put him away.</p>
<p>Scott related tales of woe from people he has gotten to know on the streets. He knows some who use their panhandling money for drugs.</p>
<p>“I thought I had a sad story, but not compared to so many of theirs,” he said. “I’m not as miserable as I thought I was.”</p>
