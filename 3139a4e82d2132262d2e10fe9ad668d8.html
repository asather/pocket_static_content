<h1>Amish, Mennonites heeding restrictions on COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just before the mid-March shutdown of public buildings and gatherings, when many Pennsylvanians were still going to work and school with an added attention to hygiene, a group of Amish gathered for a community event at a municipal building in Wilmington Township, Mercer County.</p>
<p>Stationed at the entrance was an Amish boy providing hand sanitizer for all who arrived.</p>

<p>It was just one indication that the Amish are aware of the coronavirus and are taking it seriously, township Administrator Cindy Black said.&nbsp;“The word is pretty much out there,” she said. “They all know.”</p>
<p>Similar reports are coming from communities in Pennsylvania and Ohio, which have the nation’s largest populations of the self-described Plain communities of Amish and conservative Mennonites.</p>
<p>News of the coronavirus is spreading through their version of social media —&nbsp;word of mouth.</p>
<p>Most or all church services have been canceled in the Plain communities. Because of local church autonomy, some could still be open, but they would be outliers. Networks of bishops are in regular contact and are aware of the state and federal cautions against large gatherings.</p>
<p>“Word of mouth is still very effective in the old conservative community,” said Allen Hoover, an Old Order Mennonite who works with civic authorities on child-welfare issues. “There’s not a lack of information. Most of our Plain churches are completely shut down.”</p>
<p>As with the overall population, compliance isn't perfect, with some social gatherings persisting in pockets.</p>
<p>“We’re giving the counsel,” said Police Chief Steven Echternach of Strasburg Borough in Lancaster County, who regularly communicates with local Plain community leaders. “Whether they actually adhere to it is subject to some scrutiny.”</p>
<p>He’s seen at least one wedding taking place with a large crowd, and he’s heard of churches that, while not holding worship, still plan smaller meetings of youth groups.</p>
<p>“My counsel is to cancel” any such gatherings. For weddings, “I said, do it with 10 people or less in somebody’s backyard if you’ve got to do it.”</p>
<p>The statewide school committees for the Amish and Mennonites began canceling in-school instruction for their hundreds of schools across Pennsylvania around the same time that other schools did.</p>
<p>The committees have conference calls each Friday to assess the situation, said Sam Brubaker of Lancaster County, who heads the school committee for the Old Order Mennonites.</p>
<p>“We’ll wait and see if this virus makes its bell curve and it’s on the down curve,” he said.</p>
<p>Their students, like those elsewhere, are still getting assignments — but not online.</p>
<p>Schools have discretion on how to handle lessons, Mr. Brubaker said. In some cases, one child from each family will go to the schoolhouse to pick up packets of assignments for all the children in that family, while in others, the teacher might stop by each home to deliver assignments and pick up completed school work.</p>
<p>The nation’s largest Plain population resides in and around Lancaster County, and there are several other sizable settlements in Pennsylvania ranging as far west as the Amish community in Mercer and Lawrence counties. Other large settlements are centered in Holmes and Geauga counties, Ohio.</p>
<p>The self-described Plain People are Christian groups that, among other characteristics, emphasize modest dress, male authority, cultural separatism and a general but not universal shunning of modern technology. They conclude their education around the eighth grade, typically going into farming or trades.</p>
<p>Still, the Plain communities maintain contacts and business ties with the outside world, and they’re well aware of the virus and its threat.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health “has community health nurses that work regularly with the Amish community, and have excellent relationships with these communities,” such as in boosting vaccination rates, press secretary Nate Wardle said. They are now distributing information regarding the coronavirus, and the department is working with other caregivers that work with the Amish, Mr. Wardle said.</p>

<p>Wolfgang Miggiani, a Mennonite and physician from Holmes County, Ohio, said as far as he knows,&nbsp;all the Amish and Mennonite schools are closed there.</p>
<p>“My daughter teaches at a Mennonite school, and she goes in weekly, on Fridays, to check tests and assign the next week's assignments to parents, who are scheduled throughout the day, so as to not have any large assembly,” he said.</p>
<p>The Plain churches, meanwhile, don’t have the options for livestreaming or holding Bible studies via Zoom.</p>
<p>“Our church and people are very relationship oriented, so how does one maintain and cultivate a relationship oriented community without contact —&nbsp;especially within those that don't use electronic media?” Dr. Miggiani said via email. “I'm certain we'll find a way, but it will take some added creativity.”</p>
<p>So far, Plain community leaders in Lancaster said they aren’t aware of COVID-19 cases in their communities, although Lancaster County has a significant number of cases like its eastern Pennsylvania neighbors.</p>
<p>“It’s just a matter of time” before some members get sick, Mr. Hoover said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said community members typically have stores of canned foods at home, and they are drawing on their faith in God’s sovereignty, or ultimate control.</p>
<p>“We hear that over and over,&nbsp;‘This didn’t take God by surprise,’” he said.</p>
