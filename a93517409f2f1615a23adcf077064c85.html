<p>SAN FRANCISCO —&nbsp;Uber announced thousands more layoffs on Monday, the latest round of cuts for a business that has been devastated by the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The company said it was laying off 3,000 workers and shuttering or consolidating 40 offices across the globe, including a large office in San Francisco that would be absorbed by a new headquarters.</p>
<p>Combined with earlier cuts of 3,700 employees this month, the latest layoff means Uber has trimmed its workforce by 25% since the coronavirus outbreak. It says rides have been down 80% and have only just begun to recover.</p>
<p>Uber has made up for some of that lost business with a surge in its food delivery service, Uber Eats, but the business hasn’t been enough to keep the struggling app afloat.</p>
<p>“I wanted there to be a different answer,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in an email to employees, which was shared by the company. “Ultimately, I realized that hoping the world would return to normal within any predictable time frame, so we could pick up where we left off on our path to profitability, was not a viable option.”</p>
<p>For Uber, the layoffs were the latest blow to a business that was under pressure to cut costs and improve efficiency after going public last year, in a late spring stock market listing. The initial public offering was followed by three rounds of layoffs, internal belt tightening and escalating prices as consumers saw heavily subsidized trip discounts disappear.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has put pressure on the company to cut back on experimental projects and unproven businesses in areas such as self-driving and micromobility, which represented longer investments with little immediate upside for the company’s bottom line.</p>
<p>Mr. Khosrowshahi announced Uber would reorganize certain teams around its core businesses: giving rides and making deliveries.</p>
<p>Tech companies that are based on the so-called sharing economy, including Uber, Lyft and Airbnb, have taken a hit amid the coronavirus outbreak as consumers have opted to heed shelter-in-place orders. That means consumers have also been less likely to share rides with strangers, ride in private vehicles or lodge in homes and apartments listed by independent hosts.</p>
<p>Uber’s layoffs follow similar cuts at rival Lyft, which announced a 17% reduction in its workforce in April. Airbnb laid off 1,900 earlier this month.</p>
