<h1>Clairton residents, activists protest air pollution</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the second Christmas season in a row, Mon Valley residents experienced air so bad they couldn’t take a healthy breath, and some vented their anger and frustration Friday, first at a news conference and then at the Allegheny County Board of Health meeting Downtown.</p>
<p>The county’s health board, its Health Department air quality program, its elected leaders and U.S. Steel Corp. were the targets.</p>
<p>Art Thomas joined other Clairton residents and about 100 environmental activists at a news conference in front of the City-County Building, Downtown, where he blamed the health board for his town’s having the worst air quality in the nation during a late December weather inversion that for seven days trapped air pollutants and made the air unhealthy to breathe.</p>
<p>During that December week health department data shows fine airborne particulates and hydrogen sulfide at unhealthy levels.</p>
<p>A year ago, on Dec. 24, 2018, a massive fire at U.S. Steel Corp.’s Clairton Coke Works knocked out the facility’s coke gas desulfurization system causing multiple violations of the sulfur dioxide emissions standards in the days and months that followed as repairs were made and the company continued to operate its coke works.</p>
<p>“People in Clairton are ‘nose blind’ to bad air, but it's killing us,” Mr. Thomas said. Later at a Health Board meeting that lasted for more than three hours and was attended by an overflow crowd of more than 50, he told the board, “It’s on you guys. You can do a lot better than what you’re doing.”</p>
<p>Howard Rieger, a Squirrel Hill resident, complained the Health Department failed to notify the public about the unhealthy air until days after the inversion started and said the county needs new regulations aimed at mitigating air pollution emergencies.</p>
<p>“The Health Department is our air steward, but it’s lost the public trust,” Mr. Rieger said. “They need to stop playing politics and do their job.”</p>
<p>Rachel Filippini, executive director of the Group Against Smog and Pollution, echoed a number of speakers who called on the Health Department to quickly enact new regulations that will enable it to order staged reductions of industrial emissions during strong temperature inversions that produce unhealthy air quality.</p>
<p>She said existing county rules that would allow such emergency pollution controls are 25 years old and so woefully out of date that they don’t contain provisions for regulating fine airborne particles.</p>
<p>“We also need new, stronger coke oven emissions rules,” Ms. Filippini said. “We have acute and chronic air quality problems. We all deserve clean air and it’s the Health Department’s job to make sure we have that.”</p>
<p>More than one of the 20 speakers at the board meeting urged the department to act quickly on the coke oven and emergency emissions reduction rules, but the county’s Deputy Director of Environmental Health Jim Kelly counseled patience.</p>
<p>“We’ve only got 50 people working in the health department operation and they're working on an (emergency) emissions rule, on the coke works fire and a settlement agreement,” Mr. Kelly said. “The fire set work on the new coke oven rule back.”</p>
<p>Taking note of signs held by some Clairton residents and environmental activists that demanded “Clean Air Now,” Mr. Kelly said it doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p>“Clean air doesn't happen now, not immediately. Our air is getting better but it’s because of what happened years ago with regulations and staffing,” Mr. Kelly said. “We’re on our way. We’re doing more than any air agency in the country, but we have to go through due process and the regulatory process.”.</p>
<p>But Myron Arnowitt, state director for Clean Water Action, said the two-year timeframe to enact new county rules is too long.</p>
<p>“We need something in the meantime. Clairton coke is about to bring its Battery 15 back from hot idle and we’re going to see more problems from that,” Mr. Arnowitt said. “We need a policy on how to warn the public about bad air levels.”He suggested that the health department be required to give public notice within six hours after higher pollution levels occur due to an inversion.</p>
<p>Michael Rhoads, plant manager at the Clairton Coke Works, told the health board the inversion-caused pollution levels “illustrate the complexity of the issue,” and said the company is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new environmental controls and steelmaking processes that will reduce emissions.</p>
<p>U.S. Steel issued a press release Friday afternoon saying the Pittsburgh-based steelmaker will support the health department’s development of a new meteorological program to better forecast temperature inversions and their intensity, and “do its fair share” to propose actions that mitigate high pollution levels during such events.</p>
<p>Matt Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, a coalition of more than two dozen environmental organizations, said U.S. Steel should be held accountable for the pollution it caused after the December 2018 fire and the recent December inversion.</p>
<p>“We want to be able to live,” he said, “in an Allegheny County without risks of cancer and other diseases that now affect the health of its residents.”</p>
