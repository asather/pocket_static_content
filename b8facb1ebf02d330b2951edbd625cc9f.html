<h1>Steelers rookie guard Kevin Dotson might be forced into the spotlight</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Coach Mike Tomlin said there might be “some angst” if the Steelers are forced to use rookie guard Kevin Dotson because of injuries. Well, he might want to keep the antacids readily available.</p>
<p>The Steelers view Dotson, their fourth-round draft choice, as a future starter, but they certainly didn’t need it to be right away after he missed two weeks of training camp on top of no spring practices or preseason games.</p>
<p>But, with Pro Bowl guard David DeCastro still hampered with a knee injury and the pectoral injury sustained by guard Stefen Wisniewski expected to keep him out for at least a couple games, Dotson might have to jump into the starting lineup as soon as Sunday against the Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>DeCastro is not expected to play against the Broncos after missing the past three weeks, including the season opener against the New York Giants. He did not practice Wednesday, according to the team’s official injury report. If he doesn’t play, it’s possible he could return for the Week 3 game against the Houston Texans.</p>
<p>But Wisniewski will not play and could miss three to four games, even though his injury is apparently not as serious as the pectoral injuries that ended the seasons of Cam Heyward and Stephon Tuitt in recent years.</p>
<p>Because the NFL instituted a new injured reserve list policy due to the COVID-19 pandemic that allows a player to return after three weeks, the Steelers could place Wisniewski on IR and sign a player without sacrificing a spot on the 53-man roster.</p>
<p>That leaves Tomlin with two options if DeCastro is unable to return: use Dotson or center/guard J.C. Hassenauer at that position. Hassenauer, who was on the Steelers practice squad last season, is “a guy that we are comfortable with in terms of knowing what to do and having an understanding of his skill set,” Tomlin said.</p>
<p>But there is less familiarity with Dotson, who is still trying to get acclimated to his assignments after limited practice time and no preseason games.</p>
<p>“There is some angst there, so if he is called upon this week, it is going to take a tremendous effort by him and by us,” Tomlin said. “And by us, I mean us putting him in the very best position to perform, so there is some dual responsibility there.”</p>
<p>Offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner acknowledged there’s always going to be some amount of angst when a rookie has to be thrust into the lineup with such limited work. But he said he’s “excited” to see Dotson get an opportunity based on what he’s witnessed in practice.</p>
<p>“He’s naturally really strong, I don’t know how better to say it,” Fichtner said. “He’s a strong, tough guy. It was all over his (college) video. The natural thing for him to do is get physical. Now, match the technique and fundamentals that makes his job so important, that allows you to achieve better success, those are going to have to come with time.”</p>
