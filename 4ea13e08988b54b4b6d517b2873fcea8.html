<h1>Allderdice and Obama will play in City League basketball championship</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After an 0-4 start, not many peo­ple would have ex­pected Obama to reach Satur­day’s City League cham­pi­on­ship game at Peter­sen Events Center.</p>
<p>Not only are the Eagles (13-8) go­ing to their first city cham­pi­on­ship game since 2017, they’re look­ing like a se­ri­ous con­tender to win their first city ti­tle in school his­tory af­ter ad­vanc­ing with a 57-48 win Tues­day against Brashear (8-10) in an intense semi­fi­nal matchup.</p>
<p>“We’re still a lit­tle nicked up, but they fought hard,” Obama coach Devas Sim­mons said. “Brashear played re­ally well. We’d get on a nice run, then they’d get on a nice run.”</p>
<p>Se­nior guard Na­tel Bles­sitt and fresh­man guard Tariq Francis each led the way for the Eagles with 15 points apiece, while se­nior guard Sean Snead added 10. Mean­while, Da­mon New­ton led the Bulls with 13 points, and Jayden Vin­cent and Ta’Mere Robin­son each scored 12.</p>
<p>Obama held Brashear se­nior guard Cheron Coll­ing­ton to just nine points af­ter Coll­ing­ton fin­ished as the City League’s lead­ing scorer this sea­son with an av­er­age of more than 25 points per game.</p>
<p>“His team­mates re­ally came through big for him. They hit some big shots, and they kept him in the game, and then he was able to get go­ing a lit­tle bit,” Sim­mons said. “But we def­i­nitely made sure we kept an eye on him through­out the game. Every time we played him, we kept an eye on him.”</p>
<p><strong>Other boys semi­fi­nal</strong></p>
<p><strong>All­derd­ice 89, West­ing­house 54:</strong> Se­nior guard Tony Hen­der­son led the Dragons to their sev­enth con­sec­u­tive berth in the City League cham­pi­on­ship game with a game-high 20 points. Rob Jones scored 13 points and Blake Haber added 12 for All­derd­ice (18-5), while se­nior guard Rafeik Sim­mons led the Bull­dogs (9-11) with 16 points in the de­feat. The Dragons have won a record six City League cham­pi­on­ships in a row and will face Obama at Peter­sen Events Center at 2 p.m. Satur­day.</p>
<p><strong>Girls semi­fi­nals</strong></p>
<p><strong>All­derd­ice 85, Car­rick 14:</strong> The two-time de­fend­ing City League cham­pion Dragons (21-2) steam­rolled the Raid­ers (5-15) on their way to a fourth con­sec­u­tive trip to Peter­sen Events Center on Satur­day. Se­nior point guard Emma Waite and senior guard Sophia North led all play­ers with 16 points, while fel­low se­niors Brook­lyn Jones and Nau­tica Bur­well fin­ished with 15 points apiece.</p>
<p><strong>West­ing­house 41, Obama 30:</strong> The Bull­dogs (15-5) jumped out to a seven-point lead af­ter the first quar­ter against the Eagles (10-12) and car­ried that mo­men­tum the rest of the way to punch their ticket to the City League cham­pi­on­ship game Satur­day at noon against All­derd­ice. Obama’s Ra­lyn Creigh­ton led all scor­ers with 14 points, while Khamille An­drews scored 10 points to lead the way for West­ing­house.</p>
