<h1>Steelers mailbag: Why draft a wide receiver first?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Brian Batko’s offseason-occasional Steelers mailbag. You’re more than welcome to email him at bbatko@post-gazette.com, tweet him @BrianBatko or slide into his DMs to inquire about the Steelers, NFL or anything out of bounds. </em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started, and don’t forget to join us on our weekly all-sports podcast, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/09/05/The-North-Shore-Drive-podcast-Best-and-worst-memories-of-the-Patriots-Steelers-rivalry/stories/201909050092" target="_blank">The North Shore Drive</a>, whether you use Apple, Spotify or any of the other major podcasting platforms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jim in Utah:</strong> I just can’t bring myself to believe the first pick should be a WR. As it stands today, he would be seventh in line for touches behind the top three WRs, both TEs, and Conner. I could see RB if they have no plans to keep Conner, but I prefer OL or LB. Am I wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well, Jim, you’re merely offering an opinion, so you’re not wrong. But there are holes in your thinking, just as there are for any position the Steelers might use their second-round pick in. Let’s just go one-by-one down your list now that we’re a week away from the start of the draft.</p>
<p><strong>WR —</strong>&nbsp;Yes, this would be yet another high-ish choice invested in this position. It would actually be unprecedented for the Steelers, who have never used one of their first two picks on a wide receiver four years in a row. But here’s the flipside of that: While JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Washington and Diontae Johnson were all second-rounders or a high third the past three drafts, the Steelers also haven't used their No. 1 pick on a receiver since 2006 (Santonio Holmes). They've essentially already used this year’s first-rounder on Minkah Fitzpatrick, too. And the receiving corps, while young and promising, is far from an impenetrable group. With Washington, what is he great at through two seasons? With Johnson, he’s excellent at making defenders miss with his shiftiness, but has he shown enough to be a No. 2 receiver? And even with Smith-Schuster, his production dropped off massively without Antonio Brown’s presence in the passing game. Now, it must be noted that all three weren't playing with Ben Roethlisberger last season, but only three teams had fewer pass plays of 50-plus yards in 2019. That’s not all on the quarterbacks. The idea drafting one at No. 49 is that you're going to find a wideout good enough to force his way up the pecking order for touches as a rookie, rather than settle for being seventh on the totem pole. Plus, Roethlisberger’s going to want four-and-five-receiver sets, which at this point means Ryan Switzer or Deon Cain will be counted on to make plays.</p>
<p><strong>RB —</strong>&nbsp;It only makes sense to draft one if you’re getting a true home-run hitter. As much as the receivers struggled to pop for chunk plays last year, the backfield did as well. The Steelers were one of 13 teams without a run longer than 45 yards. They were one of four teams without three runs of 25-plus yards. Benny Snell’s bread-and-butter is running between the tackles and wearing down a defense. Jaylen Samuels is a versatile pass-catcher. James Conner can do both. But who can outrun a defense to the end zone? Maybe Kerrith Whyte, but he’s no guarantee to make the team as a change-of-pace option. There are backs in this draft with long speed, but who can't do much else, so they aren't worth a second-round pick. Wisconsin’s Jonathan Taylor might be the only prospect with the right combination of traits for the Steelers, but if you can't get him at No. 49, don't bother.</p>
<p><strong>OL —</strong> If you're worried that a receiver would be seventh in line for touches, then you should also have that concern about using a second-round pick on a lineman who would be eighth in line for snaps, by the same logic. You’ve got the four returning starters, developmental tackle Chuks Okorafor, then Stefen Wisniewski and Zach Banner, both of whom the Steelers made conscious decisions to bring in or bring back this offseason. They need to add another young body here, maybe even two, but not necessarily in the second round. It’s a strange way to build a team, and perhaps partially responsible for the Steelers missing the playoffs in back-to-back years.</p>
<p><strong>LB —</strong> Quick, when was the last time the Steelers used their top pick on an offensive player? It was David DeCastro in 2012, and now in 2020, their first-rounder went toward acquiring another defensive piece in Fitzpatrick. If the Steelers make their second-rounder a defender next week, they will become just the third team in NFL history (modern era) to use their highest draft pick on the same side of the ball eight years in a row. The Packers are actually on a current streak of taking a defensive player first in eight consecutive drafts, but Aaron Rodgers might quit football if they don't get him some offensive help in the first round this year. Other than Green Bay and the Steelers, no NFL team is on a run of even four years in a row of making their first pick a player from the same side of the ball.</p>
<p><strong>Moshe in Cleveland:</strong> Any chance we sign Clay Mathews or Everson Griffen?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Matthews would be an interesting signing, considering his pedigree, and was fairly productive last year with eight sacks in 13 games for the Rams, who cut him in the middle of a two-year deal to save cap space. He has a lot the Steelers like: he was a first-round pick like eight of their other defensive players, he’s durable, he wins a lot and he has NFL bloodlines. One big “but” though: Matthews turns 34 next month, and the Steelers don't make a habit of signing late-state free agents. James Harrison was about to turn 37 when he came back for his forgettable second stint, but other than him, you’d have to go back to Flozell Adams in 2010 to find the Steelers taking a chance on a player at that age (punters not included). If the price is right, you could do a lot worse than making Matthews the new Anthony Chickillo, although playing him on special teams might be unlikely.</p>
<p>As for Everson Griffen, the longtime Vikings standout is 32 and would be a questionable fit. Sure, he also had eight sacks a year ago, but as a defensive end. Griffen has operated in Minnesota’s 4-3 defense his whole career, and while he could potentially transition to more of a stand-up edge-rusher, would he be open to doing that — as a backup — at this point? Not to mention Griffen seems to be looking for quite the pay day on what could be his final contract, and he <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001109048/article/free-agent-everson-griffen-says-2018-incident-changed-his-life" target="_blank">doesn't have the greatest reputation</a>. Another team figures to make a move on him eventually, but without a starting role, it’s tough to imagine it being the Steelers.</p>
<p><strong>Michael O.:</strong> Can we look a little closer at the Mason Rudolph question? Based on contributors to the PG chats and other internet drivel, MR nonbelievers seem to outnumber MR believers by a large margin. But I did a little research on the stat lines of QBs drafted in 2018 in their first year as a starter. MR actually had better stats than Sam Darnold and WAY better stats than Josh Allen in their respective first years as starters. Plus, Darnold and Allen both went through training camp as presumed starters, so they got starter reps. MR went through training camp as a backup, and then had to work with a Steelers offense depleted by injury. Bottom line — if the Steelers need a different QB of the future based on first year performance, then so do the Jets and Bills (based on the logic of the MR non-believers).<span style="text-align: center; font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br><strong>Brian:</strong> “Can we look a little closer at the Mason Rudolph question?” are words heard in my nightmares at this point, Michael, but you were nice enough to include this handy chart, so you won't be ignored.</p>
<p>Something tells me that the Rudolph dissenters would take umbrage with a few of your arguments. No. 1, that you can't consider his second season his first, even though he essentially “redshirted” as a rookie. No. 2, that Rudolph’s advanced stats are worse than the conventional numbers above, and that those two — especially Allen — offer much more as runners. And No. 3, some might just say that Allen and Darnold aren't even anything special to begin with.</p>
<p>Certainly, though, both would be viewed as better backup options for the Steelers than Rudolph. And they should be, considering they were first-round picks and Rudolph was a third-rounder. Your best point is that many of Rudolph’s detractors aren't being particularly fair to a guy who was not a first-rounder, even if Kevin Colbert — regrettably, probably — threw out the now infamous “first-round grade” line after he was drafted. He was a mid-round selection, and yes, 2019 was his first real, meaningful NFL action. He’s played six full regular-season games, some OK, some bad, none great. It’s not outlandish for the Steelers to be hesitant to give up on him. Those who say Rudolph will never be a reliable No. 2, let alone a future starter, may well be right, but that’s different than claiming we have enough evidence to know that at the moment.</p>
