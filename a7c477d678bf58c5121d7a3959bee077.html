<h1>Brookline urban farm idea on hold</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Councilman Anthony Coghill’s idea to quickly transform a 1.2-acre <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/26/Anthony-Coghill-urban-farm-Brookling-park-site-Grounded-Strategies-Deb-Gross/stories/202004240109" target="_blank">field in Brookline Memorial Park into an urban farm</a> will have to wait a little longer.</p>
<p>The city’s law department advised against entering into an agreement with the Larimer-based Grounded (formerly GTECH) Strategies without first putting a contract out for bid, according to a summary of the opinion provided by council members.&nbsp;(City code allows for 14 exceptions to the competitive bidding process, some of them new as council approved and the mayor signed into law in March additional categories to waive competitive bidding exceptions.)</p>
<p>“It’s not a complete momentum killer,” Mr. Coghill said.</p>
<p>The councilman presented a $40,000 plan from Grounded Strategies that included soil testing for the Brookline plot as well as identification of other plots in Councilwoman Deb Gross’ district. The two members co-sponsored the bill.</p>
<p>Council voted to recommit the bill on Tuesday; on Wednesday Ms. Gross motioned to hold for a week to see if a plan can be worked out with the administration.</p>
<p>“The goal is to get started,” Ms. Gross said. “...They need to tell us to take&nbsp;‘steps 1, 2 and 3’ to get city farms up and running.”</p>
<p>The administration remains supportive of urban agriculture, according to the mayor’s office.</p>

<p>Council gave an affirmative recommendation Wednesday to two bills that direct the city’s departments of Finance and City Planning to create a pilot farming program and provide incentives for urban agriculture.</p>
<p>Council also gave a nod of approval to a multiyear plan that allows the Allegheny County Conservation District to begin lead remediation at no cost on six city-owned vacant lots in the city’s eastern neighborhoods.</p>
<p>A final vote on those bills is expected Tuesday.</p>
