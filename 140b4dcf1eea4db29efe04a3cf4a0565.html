<h1>Pa. Department of Education 'encourages' enforcement of crowd limits</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Education “encourages” schools to still follow gathering limits for sports events because of COVID-19 concerns.</p>
<p>The department published a letter on its web site Friday afternoon entitled “Message to School Communities.” The letter states that schools should voluntarily continue to follow Gov. Tom Wolf’s order from earlier this summer for gathering limits of 250 outdoor and 25 indoor. The limits are for high school sports events, including football games.</p>
<p>Friday’s letter from the department of education came days after Monday’s ruling by U.S. District Judge William S. Stickman IV, who ruled Wolf’s restrictions on gatherings are unconstitutional. Wolf applied for a stay of Stickman’s order and appealed his decision.</p>
<p>The department’s letter to schools states, “We understand that you may be wondering how this development might impact your operations in the intervening time until the litigation comes to a resolution. The ruling was not a blanket end to the mitigation orders put in place to protect residents.</p>
<p>“School entities remain responsible for enforcing the face covering order and requiring social distancing at school and at all school events, including school sporting events. The administration encourages schools to voluntarily enforce the 25-person indoor and 250-person outdoor gathering limitations while all of us wait for the court to rule on the stay request.”</p>
<p>But on the opening night of high school football season last Friday, some schools in the WPIAL had more than 250 people in the stadium. More schools this week have decided to allow more than 250 fans in the stadium.</p>
<p>In another sidebar story related to the crowd issue, the state House and Senate recently passed a bill that would give schools the authority to decide the number of fans that can attend a sporting event. Gov. Wolf received the bill Sept. 11 and has 10 days to pass it or veto it. Wolf has said he will veto the bill. If he does, the House and Senate can override the veto.</p>
