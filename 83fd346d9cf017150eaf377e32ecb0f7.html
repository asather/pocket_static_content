<h1>Rochester's Alexis Robison repeats as first-team all-state selection</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Alexis Robison led Rochester to the WPIAL Class 1A title and was a first-team all-state pick in 2019.</p>
<p>A year later, Robison did it again.</p>
<p>Robison found her name on the Class 1A first team Wednesday when the Pennsylvania Sports Writers All-State teams for Classes 2A and 1A were released. Robison was the only WPIAL player to receive a first-team nod in either class.</p>
<p>A 5-foot-7 junior guard, Robison averaged 19.1 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.6 assists a game while leading Rochester to its second consecutive WPIAL title and to the PIAA quarterfinals for the first time before the season was shut down due to COVID-19. The Rams finished 26-1.</p>
<p>“She was spectacular,” Rochester coach C.J. Iannini said. “One of the biggest things for her was that she knew she would see extra attention. For her to do that and still have success, that’s a testament to the hard work she’s put in.”</p>
<p>Robison, who shot 45% from the field and 83% from the free throw line, was one of two Rochester players named all-state. Sophomore point guard Corynne Hauser was selected to the second team. Hauser, who already has several Division I offers, averaged 16 points a game.</p>
<p>No other WPIAL players were chosen in Class 1A, but two were selected in Class 2A. Ellis School junior point guard Natalie Jasper made the second team and Bishop Canevin senior guard Diajha Allen was a third-team pick.</p>
<p>Jasper finished third in the WPIAL in scoring with 22.9 points per game and helped Ellis reach the WPIAL semifinals and PIAA quarterfinals for the first time in school history. She averaged 29.3 points in three WPIAL playoff games.&nbsp;Allen is a Saint Francis recruit who helped Canevin its third WPIAL title in four years. She averaged 17.7 points a game and scored more than 1,000 in her career.</p>
<p>Bellwood-Antis senior Alli Campbell, a Notre Dame recruit, was named Class 2A player of the year, while Kennedy Catholic senior Malia Magestro, a Youngstown State recruit, was selected Class 1A player of the year.</p>
<p>The coaches of the year were Bishop Guilfoyle’s Kristi Kaack in Class 2A and Jenkintown’s Jim Roman in Class 1A.</p>
