<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An airman with the&nbsp;911th Airlift Wing tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, <a href="https://www.pittsburgh.afrc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2140513/911th-airlift-wing-airman-tests-positive-for-covid-19/" target="_blank">according to Sgt. Marjorie&nbsp;A. Schurr</a>, public affairs chief for the 911th.</p>
<p>The 911th Airlift Wing serves from the Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station military base next to Pittsburgh International Airport in Moon. Sgt. Schurr announced it was the first confirmed case of COVID-19 that involved the installation.</p>
<p>The airman, identified as a traditional reservist with no high-risk travel history, hadn’t been at the station in&nbsp;“almost two months” and hadn’t recently interacted with other personnel on base, Sgt.&nbsp;Schurr said.</p>
<p>The airman is currently quarantined at home.</p>

<p>The base has not changed its level of restrictions in response to the case and continues to follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease and Prevention, Sgt. Schurr said.</p>
<p>“Steel Airmen continue to take deliberate and prudent measures to protect themselves, each other, and fellow Americans while still executing our mission in defense of this Nation,” Col. John F. Robinson, 911th Airlift Wing Commander, said in the release. “COVID-19 continues to pose a threat, and we will continue to collaborate with local, state, and federal agencies to protect our people and our communities.”</p>
