<h1>Penn State asks students if they want to be responsible for shutting down fall semester</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State University calls it "Mask Up or Pack Up," a <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/628355/2020/08/13/coronavirus-faq-what-mask-or-pack-campaign" target="_blank">campaign to drive home </a>the importance of safely reopening the sprawling University Park campus in a pandemic.</p>
<p>But after crowds of largely maskless students — who, by the way, apparently were not social distancing —&nbsp;gathered outside the East Halls complex Wednesday night, Penn State President Eric Barron on Thursday put out <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/629021/2020/08/20/campus-life/president-eric-barron-shares-message-community" target="_blank">a different kind of message:</a></p>
<p>"I ask students flaunting the university’s health and safety expectations a simple question: Do you want to be the person responsible for sending everyone home?”</p>
<p>In this case, "everyone" would be University Park’s nearly 50,000 students —&nbsp;the largest campus of Pennsylvania’s flagship public university system. Fall classes there begin Monday.</p>
<p>Penn State is the latest high-profile university to warn students that reopening plans are being jeopardized by students partying and otherwise shunning social distancing rules. A day earlier, the University of Pittsburgh’s dean of students, Kenyon Bonner, said as much.</p>
<p>Each instance adds to a national debate about the importance of restarting campuses for the educational benefits versus risks to student, employees and the surrounding community, and whether such plans are realistic given the highly unpredictable spread of the coronavirus and young people’s behaviors.</p>
<p>One Pennsylvania campus, Kutztown University, was expected to be the site of a protest by faculty and others Thursday. Organizers planned to show up outside the president’s residence wearing&nbsp;“plague doctor” masks, reflecting concerns about the university’s plan.</p>
<p>Other schools, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have seen cases spike on and near campus as students arriving for fall were drawn to fraternity and other gatherings. UNC Chapel Hill this week abruptly moved the undergraduate semester online, sending many students home little more than a week after they arrived.</p>
<p>At Penn State, officials did not specify the crowd’s size, if anyone was sanctioned or if police were called.</p>
<p>“We intervened, and the crowds dispersed," was all Mr. Barron said.</p>
<p>“This behavior cannot and will not be tolerated,” he said. “We have said from the beginning health and safety is our priority, and if the university needs to pivot to fully remote instruction we will.”</p>
<p>He noted that many on campus and in the State College area are wearing masks and adhering to social distancing. He alluded to judicial sanctions that await violators, but added,”Ultimately, this is not about sanctioning. It is about protecting individual and community health.’”</p>
