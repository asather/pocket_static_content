<h1>3 injured, 1 critical, after Westmoreland County tanker truck explosion</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three people were injured, one critically, Friday when a fuel tanker truck exploded inside of a commercial garage in Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>East Huntingdon emergency officials responded to the explosion just after 4:20 p.m. in the area of 1500 New Stanton Ruffsdale Road.</p>
<p>“When we pulled on scene we had the heavy smoke and fire. We made an initial heavy attack on the inside because we thought someone was inside, but we learned everyone was out. Then the ceiling started to collapse. ... About 30 to 40 minutes into the incident we had a second explosion inside the building,” said James King, East Huntingdon Emergency Management Association director.</p>
<p>About 20 agencies, including HAZMAT teams, responded to the large blaze, and Mr. King said crews called for 12 back-up tankers of water.</p>
<p>Firefighters were able to gain control of the fire just after 6 p.m., but remained on scene until just before 11 p.m., Mr. King said.</p>
<p>The cause of the explosion will be determined by a state police fire marshal, Mr. King said, but an initial investigation points to a possible valve failure when employees were performing maintenance on a truck carrying either butane or propane.</p>
<p>Two men were flown to UPMC Mercy’s Trauma and Burn Center. One of the men is in critical condition, the other is serious, according to fire officials. A woman was taken by ambulance to UPMC Mercy in&nbsp;“moderate condition,” Mr. King said.</p>
<p>The garage is located roughly 2 ½ miles from the Pennsylvania Turnpike and I-70 interchange in New Stanton.</p>
<p>The facility is owned by Grammer Industries Inc., which in April acquired former owner North Carolina-based Sterling Transport, a liquid natural gas and dry bulk goods trucking company.</p>
<p>Grammer is headquartered in Columbus, Ind., and hauls ammonia, liquid petroleum gas, nitric acid and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>The company did not immediately respond to phone calls.</p>
