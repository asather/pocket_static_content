<h1>Judge closes jury selection to public in Wilkinsburg mass killing case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The judge presiding over the capital case of two men <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/06/wilkinsburg-mass-shooting-jury-selection-allegheny-county-cheron-shelton-robert-thomas/stories/202001060061" target="_blank">accused of killing five people at a 2016 Wilkinsburg cookout</a> on Tuesday closed jury selection to the public —&nbsp;including the media — after one of the jurors seated in the case complained that&nbsp;“vital information,” about them was published.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attorneys for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Tribune-Review have filed petitions to intervene in the case and asked Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski to reconsider.</p>
<p>“Total closure, your honor, should be very rare —&nbsp;in exceptional circumstances,” argued attorney Brandon Verdream, who represents the Post-Gazette. “We don’t think it’s required in this case. We don’t think it’s justified in this case.”</p>
<p>Judge Borkowski said he would take the matter under advisement.</p>
<p>Jury selection in the case against Cheron Shelton 32, of Lincoln-Lemington, and Robert Thomas, 31, of Homewood, began on Monday morning, and two jurors were selected — a man and a woman. They are part of a panel of 12 jurors and four alternates who are expected to hear the case, beginning with opening statements on Feb. 3.</p>
<p>During the first day of selection, attorneys for the prosecution and defense questioned nine potential jurors, explaining to them the process in a capital case, and inquiring about the individuals’ work and education, as well as family members.</p>
<p>Media representatives from local newspapers and television stations covered the day’s events and published stories about the two jurors selected, who include a man who served during the Vietnam War and a woman who works in education. Neither juror was identified by name or with the use of any images.</p>
<p>However, on Tuesday morning, Judge Borkowski said that one of the two people seated on Monday had contacted his tipstaff Monday evening.</p>
<p>“The juror was extremely upset. The juror was contacted by friends, family members and co-workers asking if the juror was empaneled in this case,” the judge said.</p>
<p>He said the juror was scared, but said he would not reveal the reasons why.</p>
<p>“If the juror knew this type of identifying information — which the juror described as vital information — was going to be disseminated, the juror would not want to be selected,” Judge Borkowski said. "The juror feels something could happen to the juror because of the exposure."</p>
<p>Judge Borkowski said he reviewed the stories published by local news outlets Monday night and that what he saw and read corroborated the juror’s portrayal.</p>
<p>Because, the judge said, he wanted to protect the defendants’ rights&nbsp; to a fair trial and a citizen’s right to serve as a juror, he ordered that the courtroom be closed to the public throughout jury selection.</p>
<p>"Although there's a presumption of openness, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has supported closure in certain circumstances,” he said. "A reasonable alternative to closure cannot adequately protect that right."</p>
<p>Mr. Verdream asked the judge to consider a less restrictive option that would allow for selection to remain open. He proposed prohibiting the media from reporting the panelists’ name, phone number, address, employer or educational institution.</p>
<p>Mr. Verdream argued that the case against Shelton and Thomas is high-profile and of significant public interest.</p>
<p>Deputy District Attorney Michael Streily also asked the court to find a less-restrictive method to protect the process.</p>
<p>“Closure really is the most restrictive measure,” he said. “The public really does have an interest.”</p>
<p>Mr. Verdream asked Judge Borkowski to halt the selection process while the media’s motion was pending, but the judge denied the request.</p>
<p>Melissa Melewsky, in-house counsel for the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association, said the U.S. Supreme Court has clearly decided that jury selection must be an open process. Complete closure of it, she said, is highly unusual.</p>
<p>"I think it damages the process because secrecy creates suspicion of wrongdoing — even if everything is being done above board."</p>
<p>Having a public process, she said, instills confidence in the judicial system and ensures fairness to the parties.</p>
<p>"The court system doesn't function properly without it," she said.</p>
<p>The closure, she continued, raises the appearance of impropriety.</p>
<p>Part of the problem in this case, Ms. Melewsky said, is that the prospective jurors weren't made aware that the selection process is a public one, and that the media has the right to report what occurs there.</p>
<p>"In Pennsylvania, jurors' names are public record presumptively," Ms. Melewsky said. "There needs to be a better understanding on the part of jurors: 'Jury service is a public process. There will be media here.'</p>
<p>"I think the court missed an opportunity there to avoid this particular problem."</p>
<p>Ms. Melewsky said she does not believe the judge's ruling would survive an appeal, and if that's the case it is possible that any jurors seated during the closed-process could be removed.</p>
<p>Judge Borkowski also addressed photographs of the defendants that were taken by the Post-Gazette on Monday as the men were being led into the courtroom by sheriff’s deputies during the afternoon session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the judge, the photos were in violation of the state rule of criminal procedure that prohibits taking photos or videos of any judicial proceedings, or courtroom, as well as a local rule.</p>
<p>In an order dated Nov. 19, 2007, the judges of the criminal division wrote that the use of all electronic devices, including cameras, was limited to only specifically designated areas of the third and fifth floors.</p>
<p>Judge Borkowski cited that order and said that he may initiate an investigation and pursue contempt proceedings relative to the photos.</p>
<p>Mr. Verdream argued that the Post-Gazette photographer who took the pictures was in the designated area on the fifth floor when the images were captured, and that the images do not depict any courtroom, witness or juror.</p>
<p>“There was no intent by our photographer to circumvent any rules,” he said. “He was in an area that was not restricted.”</p>
<p>Photography from inside the designated space — looking outside of that space — is not specifically prohibited by the 2007 order, Mr. Verdream said.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday morning, Judge Borkowski issued a separate order in the Wilkinsburg case, which reads “that no photographs or video of the defendants, prospective or empaneled jurors, or witnesses, be taken, transmitted or published in this matter.”</p>
<p>Attorneys for the Post-Gazette said that that order was overbroad and would limit the publication of any photos of the defendants. Judge Borkowski agreed with them during the afternoon argument. He accepted suggested language that would limit photography of any prospective or empaneled juror, but also said he might further modify the order.</p>
