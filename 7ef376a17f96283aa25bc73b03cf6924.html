<h1>Brian O'Neill: The Ice-Ball Man cometh </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gus Kalaris is back at the spot he’s been since he was a 2-year-old at his daddy’s knee, back behind his ice-ball cart in Allegheny Commons Park on the North Side.</p>
<p>He got a late start this year but, apart from his mask, gloves and the painted lines on the sidewalk so customers might give each other space, it is as it has always been since 1934: A man with a ready smile scrapes a big block of ice, puts the shavings in a cup, pours flavored syrup over it and folks are tasting summer again.</p>
<p>I talked with Gus just after 8 a.m. on what would be a gorgeous, sunny Wednesday, just the kind of day that has been attracting Pittsburghers to his orange cart “Since Your Dad Was a Lad.” He’d pulled his purple van with the license plate “PAPOU” (Greek for “Grandpa”) hard by the alley door of the building where he keeps his wares. It takes hours each day for him just to set up with his 75-pound blocks of ice, syrup bottles and such. But one or two calls of “Gus!” and he was out — then back in to grab some old photos of his beloved North Side that he wanted to share — and out again.</p>
<p>He’s 88 and doesn’t look it, though he can rattle off a string of past surgeries — heart, kidney, knee, prostate — that might have convinced a lesser man to retire. Not this guy. He’s long said he wants his epitaph to be “I’d Rather Be At The Park,” and even has the headstone picked out.</p>
<p>He returned to his traditional spot by the tennis courts on West Ohio Street on May 15, when Allegheny County moved to the yellow phase of the state’s reopening from pandemic lockdown. But business has been “good because nobody’s working so they’re all coming to the park.”</p>
<p>Indeed, about four hours later, a little girl in a princess dress, was on the street side of the cart, ready to field the all-important question of what flavor she wants.</p>
<p>“Um, rainbow please,” Ariana, 6, said.</p>
<p>Her mom, Carly Carabello, got a lemon-lime and an orange-cherry-pineapple, for her husband, Armando, back home in Etna. She also got popcorn for everyone. She grew up in Plum but her dad grew up in the city and would take her to see Gus every summer when she was a kid. “It’s tradition,” she said, as her daughter takes a small taste of her dad’s choice before concentrating on her rainbow icy and the trek home.</p>
<p>Melika Beasley, 30, who grew up in the Mexican War Streets, was on a bench with her two godchildren, Kenkre, 8, and Kendrick, 2, with all three of them dipping plastic spoons into their frozen treats. I asked for their take on the first ice balls of the season.</p>
<p>“It feels like summer’s coming,” Ms. Beasley said. “It feels good. It feels nostalgic.”</p>
<p>The children’s mom, Tiffany Holmes, of the South Side, a personal care assistant, was soon joining them, in uniform, for a mid-day break. She got a pineapple icy, her first in years, and it didn’t come a moment too soon.</p>
<p>Customers like that are the reason Christina, Gus’ younger daughter, helps her dad a few afternoons a week. From behind her mask, she said with a shrug, “I grew up in the park. I’m really a North Sider. I only go home [to Whitehall] to sleep.”</p>
<p>In a glossy color photo from the 1960s that Gus showed me, the cart proclaimed that popcorn boxes came in 15-cent and 30-cent sizes, as did the ice balls. Now the icies run from $1.25 to $2.25, peanuts are $1.25 and popcorn is $1.75, but if you could time-travel a North Side family from the Kennedy Era to now, they’d feel like they’d never left. Almost.</p>
<p>The cart says “Gus and Yia-Yia’s.” The latter is the Greek nickname for Grandma. The first Yia-Yia was Pauline, Gus’ mother, who died in 1992. Then came Stella, Gus’ wife, who died at 81 in 2016. These gracious women are still missed.</p>
<p>But life goes on. Ryan Bickert, 21, of Observatory Hill, says he became a regular customer when he was old enough to walk. His dad took him then, but now he’s in his eighth summer working for Gus. He loves the work (and a cherry-pineapple icy) because every day is different. The one thing that doesn’t change is that Gus likes to handle the ice scraper himself. “It keeps him young,” Ryan said.</p>
<p>I recalled for Gus a line he first told me in 1998, when he was recovering from the removal of a kidney, an appendix and part of his colon in his successful battle with cancer. When I visited the Kalaris home in Brighton Heights that summer, a neighbor was saying he tried using Gus’ ice scraper and it wasn’t 10 minutes before his arm hurt and his hand froze.</p>
<p>Gus told him, “Rub a couple of twenties on it.”</p>
<p>I asked if that still worked.</p>
<p>“I used to use twenties,” Gus said. “I have to use fifties now with inflation.”</p>
