<h1>UPMC develops COVID-19 virus test; plans to start select specimen collection next week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A UPMC virology team has developed a test for the virus that causes COVID-19 and will use it to diagnose select cases, the health system announced Saturday.</p>
<p>It said it plans to ramp up testing capacity and dangled the possibility of being able to test hundreds of patients per week&nbsp;“in the near future.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such a move would fill a&nbsp;“critical gap” before commercial tests become available, according to UPMC.</p>
<p>“Developing this test for a never-before-seen virus in the midst of a pandemic was a tremendous challenge, even for our academic medical center with its long history of such developments,” Alan Wells, medical director of the UPMC Clinical Laboratories and a pathology professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“But testing capabilities are absolutely essential to managing a pandemic. If the communities we serve see a surge in severe illnesses, we must be able to diagnose people quickly to give them the appropriate care while protecting our staff and the broader community.”</p>
<p>UPMC also said that on Tuesday it would start directing patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 to a specimen collection site on the South Side.</p>
<p>The site is not open to the general public.</p>
<p>Patients must have a doctor’s referral approved by its infection prevention team. They also will need an appointment to have the specimen collected for testing by UPMC or public health authorities.</p>
<p>Other facilities for specimen collection could open in&nbsp;Harrisburg, Erie, Williamsport and Altoona as testing capacity expands and UPMC learns from experience at the South Side location.</p>
<p>“Testing capabilities for COVID-19 in the U.S. have been delayed and limited, creating anxiety for the people we serve and impairing our ability to optimally guide the public health response,” said Donald Yealy, chair of emergency medicine for UPMC and Pitt. “By creating our own test and collection centers, we can both help our patients and the overall community. We seek getting a diagnosis in hours, not days.”</p>
<p>UPMC noted that the U.S. has lagged in COVID-19 testing capacity.</p>
<p>While collecting specimens in negative pressure rooms by using a nasal swabs, UPMC staff will wear personal protective equipment including masks or respirators, UPMC said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specimens will go to&nbsp;the UPMC Clinical Laboratories, and results will come back within 24 hours in most cases.</p>
<p>The test followed guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is validated under a federal program, UPMC said.</p>
