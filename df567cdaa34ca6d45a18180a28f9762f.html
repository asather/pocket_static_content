<h1>Pirates waste two rallies as Reds take both games of doubleheader</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CINCINNATI — Twice on the precipice of losses, the Pirates fought back against the Cincinnati Reds on Monday.</p>
<p>In the first game, they trailed by a run heading into the seventh and final inning, and first baseman Colin Moran launched a homer to right to tie it up.&nbsp;In the nightcap, they trailed by two in the top of the fourth, and first baseman Josh Bell homered to center. Third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes followed in the fifth with a two-run blast to take the lead.</p>
<p>In the end, in both games, those rallies were not enough. A walk-off home run from Tyler Stephenson in the bottom of the seventh ended the first game, 3-1. And a three-run home run from Mike Moustakas snatched the lead away from the Pirates in the second one before the Reds eventually pulled away, 9-4.</p>
<p>The rallies are just footnotes in an otherwise bad day. The Pirates (14-32) struck out 25 times in 14 innings, the most strikeouts for a Pirate offense in a doubleheader since 1901. Their pitchers walked nine Reds in the second game alone. They lost their fifth and sixth consecutive games.</p>
<p>“The things that bother me the most are the strikeouts. No. 1, we can’t strike out 25 times, or whatever it was, in essentially 14 innings,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “And we can’t walk [nine] batters in a seven-inning game, and I think we walked four in the first game. We have to execute better. That’s the thing that bothers me the most.”</p>
<p>Perhaps what’s most discouraging for the Pirates is that some of their most reliable pitchers struggled to get key outs.</p>
<p>Left-hander Sam Howard entered Monday with a 2.25 ERA and allowed the walk-off to Stephenson. Left-hander Nik Turley’s ERA was slightly higher, but he had been a steady southpaw, especially in late innings. He gave up the Moustakas bomb.</p>
<p>Then, after already trailing 6-4, right-hander Geoff Hartlieb came in to pitch the sixth, sporting a sub-2.00 ERA of his own. He allowed three runs on four walks, a hit batter, a wild pitch and was subject to a fielding error by shortstop Erik Gonzalez.</p>
<p>“All three of those guys have been really good executing. Tonight, we didn’t execute,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>That meltdown in the end overshadowed the return of right-hander Mitch Keller to the Pirates’ rotation.</p>
<p>Keller had his velocity back to 95-ish miles per hour, which is a positive sign because it had dipped dramatically before his stint on the injured list with an oblique injury. Keller said he identified some mechanical issues with his delivery during his rehab that helped bring back the velocity he lacked.</p>
<p>That being said, he still struggled with his command Monday, accounting for four of the Pirates’ nine walks and allowing two home runs of his own before exiting Game 2 after three innings.</p>
<p>“Felt really good,” Keller said. “I think I was just a little bit too amped up coming back from being on the injured list for the first time in my career in the big leagues. Just really excited to get back out there. I don’t know if that kind of played a role in the four walks, but I didn’t feel like I was shaky command-wise.”</p>
<p>Cody Ponce, who was called upon to start yet another game in a Pirates doubleheader, was solid in the first game, pitching four innings and allowing just one hit, a home run to Joey Votto.</p>
<p>Both of those starts paled in comparison to what Reds right-hander Trevor Bauer did to the Pirates’ offense in Game 1.</p>
<p>After facing a little bit of stress in the first two frames, he struck out 12 hitters through 6⅓ innings, including one stretch during which he got five straight Pirates batters out on strikes.</p>
<p>When Bauer trotted out for the seventh and final inning, his team holding onto a one-run lead, it seemed to spell trouble for the Pirates. Moran’s homer saved them for a moment, but it was not to be in the end.</p>
<p>Bauer’s outing set the stage for those 25 strikeouts Monday.&nbsp;It was a day that could have been salvaged if the Pirates backed up their rallies by holding the Reds’ bats at bay themselves. But as with so many things for the Pirates this season, it was not to be.</p>
