<h1>Pa. will get $1.988B in funding for eviction relief, Sen. Casey announces</h1>

<p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., announced Monday that Pennsylvania will receive $1.988 billion in funding for eviction relief.</p>
<p>The funding comes from Community Development Block Grants as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and will focus funds on places with households facing a higher risk of eviction, according to the announcement.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dozens of cities, townships and counties in the state are set to each receive various shares of the funding. Pittsburgh will receive $3.1 million, while Allegheny County and Westmoreland County will receive over $6.1 million and nearly $2 million, respectively.</p>

<p>“Many Americans have lost their jobs during this pandemic and are facing the possibility of being evicted, through no fault of their own,” Mr. Casey said. “This funding is essential to providing support for Pennsylvanians who need temporary financial assistance to pay rent and weather the eviction crisis that the COVID-19 pandemic has created.”</p>
<p>The funds can be used to provide renters with temporary assistance to pay rent for up to six months, the announcement said, and are geared specifically at the following types of communities:</p>
<p>The announcement comes nearly two weeks after an order to halt evictions nationwide from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went into effect Sept. 4.</p>
<p>The CDC order aims to prevent qualifying renters from being evicted from their homes until Dec. 31, to help stem the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania eviction and foreclosure moratorium, meanwhile, expired Aug. 31. The statewide moratorium was first imposed by the state Supreme Court in March and was extended by Gov. Tom Wolf via executive order twice — first to mid-July and then to late August — after it was originally set to expire in May.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf’s office said at the end of August that while it had explored the possibility of extending the moratorium until December, it had determined after a legal review that the governor does not have the legal authority to further extend the moratorium through executive order.</p>
<p>The announcement also comes only days after the U.S. Senate failed to pass a second COVID-19 relief package Thursday.</p>
<p>The $500 million measure, put up by Senate Republicans, would have included federal aid for small businesses, an extension of supplemental unemployment benefits and vaccine development — but it is a scaled-back version of an at least $2.2 billion bill desired by Democrats.</p>
<p>The bill was approved by a 52-47 vote, but fell short of the 60 votes needed to bypass a filibuster.</p>
