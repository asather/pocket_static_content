<h1>August Wilson to receive 2021 star on Hollywood Walk of Fame</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>August Wilson has gone Hollywood — and not just on-screen. The award-winning Pittsburgh playwright will receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>
<p>Ceremonies are on hold due to COVID-19 restrictions, so many members of the Class of 2020 — including Pittsburgh native Billy Porter — are awaiting their big day under the California sun.</p>
<p>However, the coronavirus lockdown did not stop the announcement of 35 new celebrities who will receive their stars somewhere along the long stretch of Hollywood Boulevard and of Vine Street, including the late playwright Wilson, named in the category of "live theater/live performance."</p>
<p>"Fences," the first major motion-picture release of a Wilson play, earned the Pulitzer Prize-winner another posthumous Hollywood honor in 2017 — an Oscar nomination for the adapted screenplay of his award-winning play.</p>
<p>"Fences" was the first of his 10 plays in the American Century Cycle filmed in Pittsburgh. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2019/07/09/Ma-Rainey-Black-Bottom-Viola-Davis-Pittsburgh-North-Side-Chicago-George-Wolfe/stories/201907090104" target="_blank">Director George C. Wolfe filmed "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"</a> on the North Side and other Pittsburgh sites in July of last year. Netflix is expected to released the movie, starring Oscar-winner Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman, some time this year.</p>
<p>Selections, made by fellow Walk of Famers, were revealed on June 18.&nbsp;Recipients would usually have two years to schedule star ceremonies from the date of selection, with dates announced at <a href="https://walkoffame.com/" target="_blank">www.walkoffame.com</a>.</p>
