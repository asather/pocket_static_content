<h1>Michael Sriprasert named president of city's oldest preservation organization </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Michael Sriprasert has been named president of Pittsburgh History &amp; Landmarks Foundation, the city’s oldest preservation organization.</p>
<p>Mr. Sriprasert, 46, of Lawrenceville, joined PHLF in 2006. He starts his new job on Aug. 10.</p>
<p>He succeeds&nbsp; Arthur P. Ziegler Jr., who started the organization in 1964 with the late Barbara Drew Hoffstot and James D.&nbsp; Van Trump.&nbsp;Mr. Ziegler, 83, lives in Avalon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am very pleased to announce that Michael Sriprasert, our vice-president, who also heads two of our subsidiaries —Landmarks Community Capital and Landmarks Development Corporations — will become president of this organization. ... I will then assume a new role as President Emeritus,” Mr. Ziegler said in an emailed newsletter sent Friday.</p>
<p>In his announcement, Mr. Ziegler said the organization and members of its boards began discussing new leadership in 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2013, six individuals who served on the Landmarks board sued the organization, Mr. Ziegler and two board members over issues of governance. When the case settled this month in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court, the agreement and court documents were sealed at the request of attorneys for Mr. Ziegler, board members Mark Bibro and Jack Norris and PHLF.</p>
<p>Mr. Sriprasert led preservation and community development initiatives in Wilkinsburg, where PHLF has created 67 units of affordable and subsidized housing in restored buildings for people who have low or moderate incomes. The&nbsp;initiative entailed cleaning up blighted vacant lots, planting community gardens, establishing an education center, providing loans to small businesses and nonprofits, awarding grants to historic churches, and creating two National Register Historic Districts.</p>
<p>Mr. Sriprasert, the announcement said, “led our efforts in lending, preservation real estate development, and advocacy in Downtown Pittsburgh, in the historic North Side, Hill District, South Side, and Hilltop neighborhoods in the city.”</p>
<p>A native of Maryland, Mr. Sriprasert grew up near Washington, D.C., and came to Pittsburgh in 2002 to pursue a Coro Fellowship in public affairs. A graduate of Kenyon College, he earned a master’s degree in public policy and management from Carnegie Mellon University and an MBA from its Tepper School of Business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I have been extremely fortunate to have been immersed in the culture of PHLF over the past 14 years, working as partners with Arthur over the past nine years as president of two of our subsidiaries,” Mr. Sriprasert said in a prepared statement.</p>
