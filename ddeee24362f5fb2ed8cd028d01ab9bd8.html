<h1>Pirates unveil early look at new alternate jerseys</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates have gone through a lot of changes this offseason, including the addition of some new threads.</p>
<p>Their official Twitter account posted a sneak peak of the team’s new alternate jerseys for the 2020 season Thursday night.</p>
<p>Pirates <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/23/josh-bell-contract-extension-pirates-2020/stories/202001230163" target="_blank">first baseman Josh Bell</a> also posted a photo of him in said new jersey on Instagram. The uniforms appear to be all black with a yellow Nike logo on the right shoulder and the word “Pittsburgh” scrawled on the chest in yellow script.</p>
<p>The full jersey announcement is scheduled for tomorrow, so this is just a small taste of what’s to come. Of course, that didn’t stop social media from reacting to what’s already available to the masses.</p>
<p>The dominant sentiment: The jerseys are cool, but that doesn’t change the lack of faith many Pirates fans have in the club’s ability to win actual baseball games.</p>
<p>Tough crowd. To be fair, some folks were more unabashedly positive about the team’s new look.</p>
<p>New year, new faces, new uniforms. What can possibly go wrong?</p>
