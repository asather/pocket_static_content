<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: Will the Pirates damage right-handed pitching?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Larry Smith and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Ezera Lenk, @ezlenk:</strong> Over/under 7.5 different DHs for the Pirates this season? I say over.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I think you’re right, Mr. Lenk. I asked Derek Shelton about prospective designated hitters last week, and I swear he mentioned at least three people I’d never heard of.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Matich, @PghMatich:</strong> Do you think Josh Bell or Colin Moran will see regular at bats as a DH this season?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I think both, and several others, will receive regular at-bats as a DH. Bell would be an obvious choice if you believe Jose Osuna is a better defensive option at first base.</p>
<p>Osuna, incidentally, hammered right-handed pitching last season after hitting lefties much better (in limited time) the year before. He’s a clear choice as DH, too, when the Pirates face a righty.</p>
<p>And when the Pirates face righties, which will be most of the time, they could cause some trouble. How about this for a lineup, with numbers vs. righties last season …</p>
<p>No. 1: Newman, SS (.824 OPS, 11 HR in 367 AB)</p>
<p>No. 2: Frazier, 2B (.781 OPS, 9 HR in 411 AB)</p>
<p>No. 3: Reynolds, LF (.931 OPS, 11 HR in 347 AB)</p>
<p>No. 4: Bell, DH (1.002 OPS, 28 HR in 384 AB)</p>
<p>No. 5: Polanco, LF (In 2018: .864 OPS, 19 HR in 336 AB)</p>
<p>No. 6: Osuna, 1B (.849, 8 HR in 169 AB)</p>
<p>No. 7: Moran 3B (.764 OPS, 11 Hr in 389 AB)</p>
<p>Center field and catcher are problem spots on offense, unless you move Reynolds to center for a day — but you still need another outfield bat. Which brings us to …</p>
<p><strong>LongLiveMLK, @Specialk186:</strong> Why didn’t the Bucs re-sign Melky Cabrera? He was a fan favorite last year and played awesome! Also who are these catchers on the roster? We had a good run for a little while?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Melky Cabrera is a professional hitter. He slowed down a bit late in the year (brutal August) but wound up hitting his usual .280, including .286 against righties. If the Pirates didn’t make a play for him — he just signed with the Mets — they should have. Same goes for Yasiel Puig, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/26/Pirates-Yasiel-Puig-analysis-should-sign-outfielder-Dodgers-Reds-Polanco-ownership/stories/202006260097" target="_blank">who is still out there</a>. I mean, why not? He would represent a clear upgrade, a bat you could put in the middle of this lineup. It’s not as if the Pirates have overspent on players. They could afford him. He’s desperate. So are they.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Noll, @PittPanther42:</strong> If and when AB makes the HOF. How will Steeler Nation react. Does he go in as a Steeler? Will the organization embrace him?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> The first question is ‘if,’ Mr. Noll (good name for Steelers questions, by the way), and right now, Antonio Brown’s career numbers fall in the Rod Smith-range. He’s 28th in career receptions, 35th in yards and 34th in touchdowns. He just lost a prime year of his career and given the events of the past year-and-a-half is no lock to play another game.</p>
<p>Three more typical AB years would have put him in the top 10 in yards and touchdowns and top five in catches. Think about that. He had a realistic chance to move into No. 2 all-time behind Jerry Rice in catches. Instead, he’s stuck between Smith and Larry Centers. There’s no shame in being 28th all-time, but are Brown’s numbers HOF-worthy?</p>
<p>That said, Brown is easily among the best five receivers I have ever seen. He could and probably should get in on the Terrell Davis, Gale Sayers plan — pure greatness over cumulative stats — but that would hardly be a guarantee.</p>
<p>To your next question, the Steelers would absolutely embrace him when and if the time comes. They have taken the high road all the way through. As to whether Brown would “go in” as a Steeler, what else could he possibly do? Go in for his one game as a Patriot with Tom Brady as his presenter?</p>
<p>Enter as a Raider and drop into the ceremony in a hot-air balloon?</p>
<p>I don’t dare predict what this dude will do later today, let alone 15 years from now.</p>
<p><strong>james hoey, @jhhoey:</strong> Joe, who won in your 3-point shot contest with Julius Page ? Did anybody make nine in a row?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey</strong>: Let’s just say, not me.</p>
<p>And no, nobody made nine in a row. Or even four in a row. It was windy.</p>
<p><strong>Mike D, @TheRealMikeD3:</strong> Do you think the Pens have a better chance of drafting #1 (12.5%) or winning the Cup?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Wonderful question, Mike D. But they don’t have a 12.5% chance to draft first. Not at this moment. That’s only if they lose to Montreal — and the chances of that are minimal. So I would say their chance to win the Cup is better than their chance to lose to the Canadiens, if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>Does that make any sense?</p>
<p><strong>Just a boy with a monkey on his shoulder, @SlowPeeps:</strong> What was your last concert?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I believe it was the Mavericks, Dr. SlowPeeps. My wife’s a big fan.</p>
<p>Top five concerts of all-time (years an approximation):</p>
<p>5. Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers, 1986? Giants Stadium. Complete insanity. The music was good, too.</p>
<p>4. Rusted Root, Lots of Times, Graffiti. Greatest dance nights of all-time.</p>
<p>3. 10,000 Maniacs, 1990, Soldiers and Sailors: Natalie Merchant in her prime.</p>
<p>2. Richie Havens, 1985, University at Buffalo (yes it’s the University “at” Buffalo, which makes me irrationally angry). Made the mistake of mixing wine and beer that night.</p>
<p>1. Bob Dylan, 1990, Ithaca College. I was maybe 30 feet away. He was intelligible for once. And he played the piano that night.</p>
<p><strong>D’yer Mak’er, @JoeMill68469097</strong>: Did you ever see Dr. J play in person?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> To my eternal regret, I did not, Dr. Mak’er. But that brings up the five basketball players I wish I’d seen in person:</p>
<p>5. David Thompson</p>
<p>4. George Gervin</p>
<p>3. Wilt Chamberlain</p>
<p>2. Dr. J</p>
<p>1. Pistol Pete</p>
<p><strong>Jake Corcoran, @Jake_Corcoran:</strong> Will there/should there be pierogi races at Pirate games this summer?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Yes, Mr. Corcoran, as long as they are six feet apart.</p>
