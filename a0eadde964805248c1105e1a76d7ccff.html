<h1>Munhall native Gabby Barrett to perform 'I Hope' on ACM awards show next month</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gabby Barrett will be among the performers when the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards are handed out Sept. 16 on CBS.</p>
<p>The program was originally scheduled to broadcast live from Las Vegas in April but was moved to September. When it became clear a traditional awards show could not be held, producers worked out an alternate schedule in which acts will perform remotely from three iconic venues in Nashville: the Bluebird Cafe, the Grand Old Opry House and the Ryman Auditorium.</p>
<p>Barrett is among the 2020 nominees for best new female artist of the year. That award has already been presented, to Tenille Townes. Munhall native Barrett, who recently announced her pregnancy with husband Cade Foehner&nbsp;— whom she met when they were on&nbsp;“American Idol&nbsp;— is expected to sing her No. 1 hit,&nbsp;“I Hope” from the Ryman.</p>
<p>Also of local interest are Dan Smyers, a McCandless native and Carnegie Mellon University graduate, with Shay Mooney. The Grammy-winners known as Dan + Shay are up for best country duo. With Justin Bieber, their&nbsp;“10,000 Hours” is up for song of the year, music event of the year and music video.</p>
<p>The ACM Awards will also be streamed live on CBS All-Access.</p>
