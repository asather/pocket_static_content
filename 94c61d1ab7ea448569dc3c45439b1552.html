<h1>Federal law, evolving HR practices control what happens after a COVID-19 diagnosis</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>So you’ve been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus.&nbsp;What happens now?</p>
<p>First, testing positive for this virus speeding its way around the globe will mean quickly separating yourself from others until the risk of spreading the disease is passed —&nbsp;with that separation most often voluntary, Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine said at a recent news conference.</p>
<p>On a basic level, that means not going to work or school or church, of course.</p>
<p>What happens after that is controlled by a 24-year-old federal law and evolving employment practices, as health care providers try to take steps to stop the spread of the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>First, your doctor is required to report your test results to state health authorities — COVID-19, like tuberculosis and syphilis, is a reportable disease.</p>
<p>Since enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, personal health care information has been protected from disclosure.&nbsp;But some caveats apply during public health emergencies such as this one.</p>
<p>Doctors will notify public health officials of a coronavirus infection, which is information critical to ensuring public health and safety, according to an article in Monday’s HIPAA Journal.&nbsp;“In such cases, personal health information may be shared without obtaining authorization from the patient. The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits disclosure of personal health information to individuals involved in the care of a patient, such as friends, family members, caregivers and other individuals that have been identified by the patient.”</p>
<p>The push to contain the spread of the virus means tracking its route.</p>
<p>In the U.S., state and local health authorities will identify people who have been in contact with the infected person to limit spread of the disease. That may include telling the person’s clients and colleagues about the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Employers are bound to the privacy rule only when they learn of the diagnosis from the employee’s health insurer. Conversations about health problems with your employer are not covered by HIPAA’s privacy rule, so the employer is not bound to secrecy if the infected person — rather than insurer, doctor or law enforcement official —&nbsp;discloses positive rest results.</p>
<p>Release of information to the media is limited to the individual’s general condition, with the minimum necessary information released to achieve the “purpose for which the information is being disclosed,” according to the HIPAA Journal guidelines.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are a number of things that are still unclear.</p>
<p>Craig Brooks, partner and head of employment and labor law group at the Downtown law offices of Houston Harbaugh P.C., worried whether an infected employee could face liability for not informing the employer directly. Litigation may be necessary to set a standard.</p>
<p>“You sure have a moral obligation to tell them,” Mr. Brooks said. “There could be criminal liability for putting others at risk.”</p>
<p>In Italy, which has been hard-hit by the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus, the country’s National Institute of Health on Monday reported the virus’s lethality was more than six times higher than for seasonal flu for people between the ages of 60 and 69, lower for younger people.</p>
<p>Experts say the mortality rate may ultimately be lower overall when results of more aggressive testing become available.</p>
<p>Companies and others touched by this health crisis are learning as they go.</p>
<p>Human resource practices in the age of COVID-19 are quickly evolving, said Bob Floreak, president of Marshall-based consultant Acuity Human Resources.</p>
<p>“We haven’t had that many cases of coronavirus in Western Pennsylvania, and none of our clients have experienced that,” Mr. Floreak said.&nbsp;“Many of our clients are struggling to find answers, and they’re having a hard time because the answers don’t exist.”</p>
