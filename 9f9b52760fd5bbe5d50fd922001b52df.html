<h1>As losses continue to pile, Pirates hope to prevent negative clubhouse environment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After the Pirates wrapped up their 16th loss in 20 games against the Cleveland Indians on Wednesday night, catcher Jacob Stallings was asked about the team’s psyche right now.</p>
<p>More or less, Stallings said he thinks it’s easy for players to be negative with how the season has gone to this point, and he is guilty of it, too.</p>
<p>Stallings went on to say that he didn’t have the answers for how to flip that feeling, noting that if he did, the Pirates would have done it already.</p>
<p>Really, though, it isn’t Stallings’ job to turn the team around. That is manager Derek Shelton’s job.</p>
<p>Shelton has coached under now-Angels manager Joe Maddon, who is known for abnormal tactics in keeping the clubhouse mood light. He has, among many other things, hired magicians and brought in animals like penguins and snakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shelton isn’t ready to go there just yet, but he does feel the pressure of keeping things positive and the difficulty of doing so with a team that has started a season so poorly.</p>
<p>“Honestly, for me, it’s making sure I stay who I am,” Shelton said Thursday. “We knew we were in a situation this year where we were going to have to evaluate, and I’m not going to change my personality. Regardless of what we’re doing or how we’re doing, we’re going to stay the same. We’re going to continue to work. It’s really important to me that our effort level stays up, and I think it has done that. It’s my job to continue to make sure that we find ways to have fun.”</p>
<p>Of course, the real solution would be to win more games.</p>
<p>The Pirates are obviously trying to do that, but things have been tough. A team that entered this season with measured outside expectations has suffered injuries, cancellations of games, and offensive/bullpen struggles, to name a few things.</p>
<p>They’ve been close in some games and lost. Some have not been so close. The uniting factor is that there have been a lot of losses, and no matter who the manager is, that can wear on a roster.</p>
<p>“When you're in a situation like this, especially a shortened season when everything's heightened — you know, one loss feels like four or five — it just feels so much bigger,” pitcher Chad Kuhl said Thursday. “We just need to do a little better job of winning those close games and piling on good at-bats and good outings. That’s our biggest weakness right now.”</p>
<p>That grind can be even tougher on hitters like Stallings. Rather than a starting pitcher, who at worst could struggle every five days, it’s a daily thing for position players.</p>
<p>Shelton gave right fielder Gregory Polanco, left fielder Bryan Reynolds and second baseman Adam Frazier the day off against Cleveland on Thursday. Maybe that rest can help turn things around for those three hitters, who are all batting .176 or worse.</p>
<p>For this season, it might not matter. What does matter is that in a losing skid like the Pirates are experiencing, negative feelings can metastasize. The only way to stop that is to win. That’s easier said than done.</p>
<p>“It’s (about) getting to that point where baseball is fun again, everybody relaxes a little bit and you, hopefully, start a winning streak,” Kuhl said.</p>
<p>“No magicians planned, though, if that’s what you’re asking,” Shelton added. “Or snakes. [Maddon] had snakes one time. Snakes scare the hell out of me.”</p>
<p><strong>Kuhl</strong><strong>&nbsp;happy to be working</strong></p>
<p>Kuhl would rather nobody ask him how his arm feels.</p>
<p>After undergoing Tommy John surgery in late 2018 and regaining full health this season, he understands it’s natural for people to be concerned about his arm’s health.</p>
<p>Since throwing five innings in his last start against the Cincinnati Reds, though, he feels he’s back to a full workload. So he hopes that is joined by lowering concern in his health as he tries to become just another member of the Pirates’ starting rotation.</p>
<p>“I think Tommy John guys, you get really good at celebrating those small victories and everything that goes along with coming back from the surgery,” Kuhl said. “It’s just a good feeling. You want to just be normal. I’ve said that 100 times, you want people to stop asking how your arm is. You want people to kind of forget that that whole thing happened and just move on from it.”</p>
<p>While that is a valid feeling for Kuhl, Shelton may not be ready to stop asking quite yet.</p>
<p>He said Thursday that, despite Kuhl’s ability to throw five innings without a hitch, he may not be completely off the leash yet. It’s something that the Pirates will play by ear.</p>
<p>To do that, Shelton will continue monitoring Kuhl’s health, as he does anyone else.</p>
<p>That will be accompanied by words of encouragement, too, which have been common between Shelton and Kuhl this season. The manager has frequently spoken with Kuhl during or after starts to give him affirmation, knowing that Kuhl wants to pitch as much as possible and that it’s tough for any pitcher to be limited by pitch or inning limits.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, it’s something that’s really cool,” Kuhl said. “I’m one of the guys who have had Tommy John surgery and have made a successful comeback to the major leagues. So really cool at the end of the day just for him to recognize that, and it’s awesome to have that affirmation for me. It’s really cool.”</p>
