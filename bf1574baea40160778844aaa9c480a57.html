<h1>Seahawks edge thin Eagles in NFC wild-card game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PHILADELPHIA — After Jadeveon Clowney knocked out Carson Wentz, Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks knocked off the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>Wilson threw a 53-yard touchdown pass to DK Metcalf, Marshawn Lynch had a rushing score and the Seahawks beat the Eagles, 17-9, in the wild-card round of the NFC playoffs on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Making his first career playoff start, Wentz lasted two series before exiting with a head injury after a helmet-to-helmet hit from Clowney.</p>
<p>Nick Foles wasn’t around to rescue Philadelphia this time.</p>
<p>Forty-year-old Josh McCown stepped in, the oldest quarterback to make his playoff debut. He couldn’t lead the Eagles (9-8) into the end zone.</p>
<p>The Seahawks (12-5) lost three of their final four games, including a 26-21 loss against San Francisco last week that cost them the NFC West title.</p>
<p>But they traveled to Philadelphia for the second time in six weeks and became the third team to win on the road this weekend, improving to 8-1 away from home this season.</p>
<p>Wilson threw for 325 yards and led the team with 45 yards rushing. Metcalf had seven catches for 160 yards.</p>
<p>The Seahawks had a season-high seven sacks from six players.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to step it up in the playoffs,” Clowney said. “We knew it was going to be an upfront game, the whole game. They’ve got a great offensive line, great veteran players.”</p>
<p>Wilson drove Seattle 82 yards late in the second quarter. Lynch powered in from the 5 for a 10-0 lead.</p>
<p>Wilson connected with Metcalf for 26 yards and David Moore for 38 on third-down catch-and-run passes to extend that drive.</p>
<p>McCown finally got the offense going on the opening drive of the third quarter. He connected with Zach Ertz for 32 yards and Boston Scott ran 15 yards to the 5. But a false start, fumbled snap and sack followed. Jake Elliott’s 26-yard field goal cut the deficit to 10-6.</p>
<p>The Seahawks answered quickly. Metcalf stretched to catch Wilson’s deep pass, got up and tumbled into the end zone for a 17-6 lead.</p>
<p>“I caught the ball, I didn’t feel anybody touch me,” Metcalf said. “I got back up and I wanted a touchdown. I wanted a touchdown, real bad.”</p>
<p>Down 17-9, Eagles coach Doug Pederson passed up a 42-yard field goal attempt with 6:24 left and went for fourth-and-4 from the Seahawks 24. Miles Sanders couldn’t catch McCown’s pass.</p>
<p>Philadelphia had another chance after Shelton Gibson, just signed earlier in the week, drew a 39-yard pass interference penalty to the Seahawks 13.</p>
<p>On fourth-and-7 from the 10 with two minutes left, Clowney sacked McCown.</p>
<p>The Eagles were decimated by injuries throughout the season and had to rely on five players off the practice squad during a four-game winning streak that sealed the NFC East title.</p>
