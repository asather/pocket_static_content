<h1>Missing Whitehall woman's remains found in garbage bag at Plum dumping site</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In September, Douglas Berry was charged with killing a Whitehall woman who went missing a year ago.&nbsp;It was the first homicide case since 2007 that Allegheny County authorities had prosecuted without a body.</p>
<p>That’s no longer the case.</p>
<p>Police announced Monday afternoon that the remains of Elizabeth Wiesenfeld, who disappeared April 30, were found Sunday morning in Plum.</p>
<p>A police officer on patrol in an area known for illegal dumping and off-road vehicle use found a garbage bag with a shoe visible through a tear.</p>
<p>The remains were identified Monday as Ms. Wiesenfeld, 67.</p>
<p>Police have built what appears to be a strong circumstantial case against Berry, a handyman who had done work for Ms. Wiesenfeld, including evidence that shows him withdrawing cash at an ATM using her debit card 13 hours after her disappearance in April. That same card — in pieces and melted — was later found by detectives inside a Miller Lite beer can in the trash at Berry’s home in Liberty</p>
<p>At a news conference in September, District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. said that even if Ms. Wiesenfeld were not found, he believes the case against Berry is solid.</p>
<p>"There has been an extensive effort that’s been coordinated through county police to try to find Betsy," District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. said in September upon announcing charges against Berry, noting investigators had searched numerous wooded areas.</p>
<p>The official determination that Ms. Wiesenfeld’s death was a homicide, and the manner in which she was killed, will come from the&nbsp;Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office.</p>
<p>Anyone with information is asked to call county police at&nbsp;1-833-ALL-TIPS (1-833-255-8477).</p>
