<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh International Jazz Festival is the latest festival to be postponed due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>The annual event, presented by August Wilson African American Cultural Center, was set to take place Downtown on the weekend of June 18.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In its first 10 years, the festival has become a hallmark of our city, a beacon for some of the world’s greatest musicians, and a destination for their most devoted fans,” AWAACC director Janis Burley Wilson said in a statement. “However, your health and safety—along with the health and safety of our staff and the musicians—remain our highest priority.”</p>
<p>The Center hopes to move the festival to a later date, to be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Wilson added that it is looking at ways to bring people jazz online that weekend.</p>
<p>They’ve also launched <a href="https://aacc-awc.org/visit/galleries-spaces/" target="_blank">virtual tours of the two visual arts exhibitions </a>that closed early in response to COVID-19: “Vanishing Black Bars &amp; Lounges: Photographs by L. Kasimu Harris” and “I came by Boat so Meet me at the Beach: Ayana M. Evans and Tsedaye Makonnen.”</p>
<p>Beginning April 27, they will present Lit Fridays, a new conversation series, in celebration of what would have been August Wilson’s 75th birthday.&nbsp;The first session will feature actors Ruben Santiago-Hudson and Nathan James, poet jessica Care moore, and August Wilson scholar Dr. Sandra Shannon in conversation with Curator of Literary Programs Deesha Philyaw.&nbsp;It will continue on the final Friday of each month.</p>
