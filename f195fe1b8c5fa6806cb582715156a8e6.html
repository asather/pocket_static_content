<h1>Sales tax hit means 20% cuts to libraries, museums, arts groups and more in Allegheny County</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Facing a pandemic-driven steep loss of sales tax revenue, local libraries, museums, arts and culture groups and more, will soon feel a serious budget hit.</p>
<p>Board members of the Allegheny County Regional Asset District voted unanimously to approve a 20% across-the-board reduction for all 2020 grantees starting June.</p>
<p>“We are very conscious of the difficulties that all of our assets are in, from the libraries, to the museums, to the Cultural Trust, to the ballet, ... we understand it. The smaller assets, I think, are feeling this especially acutely,” said Dusty Elias Kirk, RAD board chairperson, during the meeting.</p>
<p>With the proceeds from half of a 1% sales tax in Allegheny County, RAD funds a vast array of organizations and nonprofits — 46 different local library systems including the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, arts and cultural organizations, museums such as the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh and Children's Museum, regional parks, and transit.</p>
<p>The other half of the sales tax proceeds go to Allegheny County and municipal governments; that funding goes directly to local governments from the state.</p>
<p>March RAD sales tax revenue was $7.18 million — $1.82 million lower than RAD's budgeted projections. But, as board member Daniel Griffin noted during Thursday's online meeting, that only reflects about two weeks worth of stay-at-home orders that took effect mid-March. Collections for April — those figures aren't yet available — will likely be "at all-time low," he said.</p>
<p>“No one could have imagined such a devastating situation,” he said.</p>
<p>The group's 2020 budget, put forth late last year, authorized grants totaling $109.5 million to 106 organizations. About 31% of funds in the budget go to libraries; with another 31% to parks and trails.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the board also voted to suspend 2020 capital funding to the assets it funds until further notice.</p>
<p>If matters improve, some funding could be restored, Ms. Kirk said. Similarly, if finances worsen, “we have to reevaluate.”</p>
<p>“The last time we had an economic downturn, we were able to restore some of that money as things got better,” she said.</p>
<p>Between the widespread closures that dried up sales tax and parking revenue, and high unemployment, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to impact all levels of government funding. The state has already said it expects to have a serious budget shortfall, and the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/05/04/pittsburgh-peduto-adopts-hiring-freeze-covid-19-pandemic/stories/202005040062?cid=search" target="_blank">city of Pittsburgh has already instituted a hiring freeze and announced it will leave a number of positions vacant</a>.</p>
