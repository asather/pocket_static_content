<h1>Peters Township's Breylen Carrington breaks out in win vs. Penn-Trafford</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Peters Township has a roster loaded with talent and household names. And if Breylen Carrington wasn’t one of them before, he certainly is now.</p>
<p>Florida recruit Donovan McMillon and Miami of Ohio recruit Corban Hondru receive most of the headlines for the Indians, but it was Carrington who put together the performance of a lifetime Friday night in the Class 5A No. 4-ranked Indians’ 24-21 win against No. 5 Penn-Trafford (1-1). The senior intercepted four passes and returned two for touchdowns, adding two carries for 32 yards to lead Peters Township (1-0) to a huge non-conference win at home to open its season.</p>
<p>“Our team just played well, and that’s all that I’m really happy about, that we won,” Carrington said. “We all played well. It wasn’t just me, it was everyone else.”</p>
<p>The Indians waited almost 10 full months to take the field since last season’s devastating 21-20 defeat to Gateway in the WPIAL Class 5A championship, and they wasted no time taking out all their pent-up aggression on the Warriors.</p>
<p>McMillon made his presence felt on the first play from scrimmage, sacking Penn-Trafford quarterback Ethan Carr at the 1. Two plays later, Carrington intercepted Carr over the middle and returned it 28 yards for a touchdown to give Peters Township an early 7-0 lead.</p>
<p>Carr quickly put the costly mistake behind him, though, promptly leading the Warriors downfield for an eight-play, 80-yard scoring drive capped off by an 18-yard strike to Chase Vecchio.</p>
<p>The Indians then responded with a scoring drive, as senior running back Vinny Sirianni scored from 11 yards to put Peters Township back on top. Senior quarterback Logan Pfeuffer again led the Indians right down the field on their next possession, but Cole Mains intercepted Pfeuffer in the end zone to keep it a one-possession game.</p>
<p>Penn-Trafford put together a couple of promising drives late in the second quarter, but Carrington put an end to both of them with two more interceptions to preserve Peters Township’s 14-7 lead going into the break.</p>
<p>“I didn’t even know he had four interceptions until after the game,” Indians coach T.J. Plack sais. “He had a great game. He was a kid who was injured for us last year and came back for the last four or five games. He did a good job on defense for us.”</p>
<p>Peters Township kicker Andrew Massucci missed a 43-yard field goal after the Indians defense forced and recovered a fumble by Carr, but the junior would redeem himself later. Meanwhile, Carrington added his second pick-6 of the game on the very next play after Massucci’s miss, stretching Peters Township’s lead to 21-7.</p>
<p>“[College] coaches need to see him,” McMillon said about Carrington. “I’ve always seen him as a ballhawk. He’s a huge playmaker for us.”</p>
<p>This one was far from finished, though.</p>
<p>Carr tossed a 37-yard touchdown pass to senior Brad Ford early in the fourth quarter to trim the Warriors’ deficit to seven, and it didn’t take long for them to tie the score. On the second play of the ensuing drive, senior Cole Darragh intercepted Pfeuffer and returned it for a 30-yard touchdown, shifting all the momentum squarely in Penn-Trafford’s favor.</p>
<p>That’s when Pfeuffer and the Indians responded with their biggest drive of the game, a 12-play series that took up a huge chunk of the clock and resulted in a go-ahead 36-yard field goal by Massucci. Senior defensive end Austin McKinnon then intercepted Carr on the first play of the Warriors’ next drive, setting Peters Township up with great field position and a chance to ice the game.</p>
<p>Instead, Penn-Trafford’s defense forced a turnover on downs, but the Indians defense returned the favor by forcing a three-and-out on the Warriors’ final drive to clinch the victory.</p>
<p>“They’re so well-coached. I call it a pleasure, because I think they’re a great coaching staff and they’ve got great ballplayers,” Plack said about Penn-Trafford. “We weren’t sure this game was going to happen until like 10 days ago, and then to plan for them, our defensive staff did a great job.”</p>
