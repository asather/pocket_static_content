<h1>Sidney Crosby does not practice in Denver after 'some really strong days'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>DENVER — Sidney Crosby, after pushing himself in a pair of workouts in Las Vegas, did not join the Penguins for Thursday’s practice at Pepsi Center, nor did he take the ice with injured teammates Nick Bjugstad and Justin Schultz.</p>
<p>Mike Sullivan explained that Crosby was given a scheduled day off.</p>
<p>“Sid’s going through a rehab process. The nature of this injury, it’s an evolving process,” the Penguins coach said. “Part of that process is introducing him to the team environment. And then obviously we see how he responds to the team environment and the medical staff makes decisions accordingly.”</p>
<p>Sullivan remains encouraged by where Crosby is in that process.</p>
<p>“He’s had some really strong days. You can see him getting stronger with each day that he’s out there,” he said of Crosby, who skated the previous two days.</p>
<p>Given that Crosby has still not practiced without contact restrictions, which he has said is the next step in his rehab after sports hernia surgery, he is not expected to return to the lineup Friday against the Colorado Avalanche.</p>
<p>Sunday’s game in Arizona is also in question. But even if Crosby is not ready to play against the Coyotes in the last game of this week-long trip, Sullivan said it has been “great” to have Crosby back on the road with the Penguins.</p>
<p>“Just his presence around the team, everyone looks up to him. He has a great presence. He’s a great teammate. He’s close friends with these guys,” Sullivan said. “So for him to be around the team like this is terrific for all of us.”</p>
<p>The upcoming schedule will present a challenge to the Penguins as they try to further reintegrate Crosby — and also Bjugstad and Schultz — into the mix.</p>
<p>They are scheduled to practice Saturday in Arizona. They then play six games in 10 days and may practice only once or twice over that span, noteworthy with Crosby needing to practice with contact to receive full clearance.</p>
<p>“That’s part of the challenge,” Sullivan said. “It’s one of those things that’s really out of our control. ... The challenge for the guys that are in the rehab process and [with] reintroducing them into the team environment is trying to get them into team practices and get them the workload that they need.”</p>
<p><strong>Jarry ‘still soaking in’ honor</strong></p>
<p>Two days later, Tristan Jarry still can’t believe <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/01/07/Penguins-Tristan-Jarry-Kris-Letang-NHL-All-Star-game-Jake-Guentzel/stories/202001070163" target="_blank">he was named</a> an All-Star.</p>
<p>The goalie, who leads the NHL in both goals-against average and save percentage, was selected as an injury replacement for the All-Star game, which takes place in St. Louis on Jan. 24-25. Kris Letang is also going as an injury fill-in.</p>
<p>The media relations staff told Jarry earlier this week that the NHL was considering adding two Penguins to the Metropolitan Division roster. Hours before starting in Tuesday’s 4-3 win over Vegas, Jarry learned he officially made it.</p>
<p>“It’s something you dream of,” he said. “You watch every year on TV and you see all the great players that play in it. So it’s pretty neat. It’s still soaking in.”</p>
<p><strong>Marino and Makar meet again</strong></p>
<p>John Marino of the Penguins and Cale Makar of the Avalanche are both among the league leaders in points by a rookie defenseman this season. Makar leads all rookie blue-liners with nine goals and 32 points. Marino is fourth with 20 points and his plus-14 rating was second among all rookies entering Thursday.</p>
<p>“He’s a really smooth skater,” Marino said of Makar. “Dangerous shot. He’s smart. He closes on people fast defensively. He’s pretty active. He’s a good player.”</p>
<p>Marino would know. While at Harvard last spring, Marino skated against Makar. Makar’s University of Massachusetts team ended Harvard’s season.</p>
<p>“We played him last year in the [NCAA Northeast Regional]. One of the guys on our team had a breakaway. [Makar] was at the blue line and our guy was at the far blue line. And he caught him, lifted his stick and went back the other way with the puck,” Marino recalled. “He just makes it look effortless.”</p>
<p><strong>Praise for the Blueger line</strong></p>
<p>Sullivan on Thursday was asked about Dominik Kahun earning a role on the top line. Midway through his answer, he pivoted to give unsolicited praise to his pesky third line of Teddy Blueger, Zach Aston-Reese and Brandon Tanev.</p>
<p>Those three have opened a game on the same line in 27 of 43 games.</p>
<p>“We’ve really liked Teddy Blueger’s line. That’s why we’ve kept it together,” he said. “They’ve got a unique identity. They’re a great checking line. We utilize them in a certain capacity that helps us. And they’ve helped us offensively.”</p>
<p>Tanev scored the game-winner in each of the team’s last two wins.</p>
