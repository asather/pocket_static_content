<h1>"White plague" program shows how we did social distancing 100 years ago</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>DoorsOpen Pittsburgh is holding a virtual discussion Saturday about the impact of tuberculosis, known as the “white plague” in 1915.</p>
<p>To participate in the online event from 10 to 10:40 a.m, go to <a href="https://app.gopassage.com/events/whiteplague" target="_blank">https://app.gopassage.com/events/whiteplague</a>.&nbsp;A donation of at least $1 is required.</p>
<p>Curator Pam Gianni will provide the inside story behind the disease and how it ravaged Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>"Like the coronavirus pandemic today, the disease we now call tuberculosis changed everyday life forever," said Bonnie Baxter, founder of DoorsOpen Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>There were two hospitals only for people with tuberculosis because no other hospitals would take them, she said. There was no cure then for tuberculosis, spawning fake cures and conspiracy theories. In the 1940s, a cure was discovered that killed the bacteria causing the disease. TB&nbsp;spreads from person to person through the air.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s 1900 or 2020, the similarities between how people reacted then and how they are reacting now are striking,” Ms. Gianni said. "We’ll show you what social distancing and unproven treatments looked like and the social changes from 1915 we’re still living with today, long after the disease was cured.”</p>
