<h1>7 red-carpet fashion trends from the 2020 Golden Globes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Golden Globe Awards’ red carpet produced a cornucopia of fashion trends as the lead-in to Hollywood awards season, with the always unpredictable Grammys&nbsp; (Jan. 26) and the Oscars (Feb. 9) following in the Globes’ glamorous heels.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of trends from the night that saw many a grand entrance, including Billy Porter’s regal white tux with a feather train, Jason Momoa rocking a velvet blazer and tank top and Jennifer Lopez, wrapped in white and green and tied together with a giant gold bow.</p>

<p><strong>Skin:&nbsp;</strong>Plunging necklines, thigh-high slits and overflowing bodices — or none at all — ruled the red carpet. Presenter Kerry Washington wore a jeweled harness with a black blazer and silk skirt that left little to the imagination; Saoirse Ronan (“Little Women”) wore a glittery Celine slip gown with lots of leg; presenter Gwyneth Paltrow showed off her figure in a sheer, tiered gown by Fendi.</p>
<p><strong>Monochrome:</strong> Tiffany Haddish in a pink dress by Galia Lahav, Scarlett Johansson in a scarlet Vera Wang ballgown with a plunging neckline, Jodie Comer (“Killing Eve”) swathed in emerald green (complete with references to the internet’s adorable favorite Baby Yoda); Nicole Kidman in a red strapless sheath and Reese Witherspoon (“Big Little Lies”) all in white; and best actress winner Renee Zellweger (“Judy”) in&nbsp;a baby blue strapless gown by Armani Privé,&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Puffy sleeves:</strong> Comer and Cate Blanchett (“Where’d You Go, Bernadette”) in Mary Katrantzou, along with best actress in a TV drama winner Olivia Colman (“The Crown”), Dakota Fanning; Beyonce —&nbsp;with golden wings and lots of skin —&nbsp;and many more.</p>
<p><strong>Black and white:</strong> Cynthia Erivo (“Harriet”) in a body-hugging beaded Thom Browne gown, plus a $3 million Bulgari necklace; director Greta Gerwig (“Little Women”) in off-the-shoulder Proenza Schouler; Zoe Kravitz in polka dots large and small, by Saint Laurent; Margot Robbie, whose top included another trend: intricate embellishments, which apparently took 4,750 sequins and 225 hours to construct.</p>
<p><strong>Works of art:</strong> Joey King (“The Act”) in an Iris van Herpen creation that seemed to ripple and flow in a graphic optical illusion, and Blanchett in a rippling yellow gown with a daring woven diamond bodice by Mary Katrantzou.</p>
<p><strong>Men in velvet:</strong> So many and all ages, from Lifetime Achievement honoree Tom Hanks to nominee Eddie Murphy, from presenters Ansel Elgort and Chris Evans to youngest nominee Roman Griffin Davis (“JoJo Rabbit”).</p>
<p><strong>Women in suits:</strong> Phoebe Waller-Bridge (“Fleabag”), who won best actress in a TV comedy; presenter Kate McKinnon; honoree Ellen DeGeneres and wife Portia de Rossi.</p>
