<h1>Space junk? 2 satellites could collide high above Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two defunct satellites could collide Wednesday evening about 560 miles above Pittsburgh — a collision that would generate thousands of pieces of space debris, according to LeoLab Inc., a California-based satellite tracking company.</p>
<p>In a tweet late Tuesday, the company placed odds of a collision of satellites IRAS and GGSE 4 at 1-in-1,000, a ratio that was tightened as the objects got closer. Officials in&nbsp;Menlo Park, Calif., squeezed the odds to 1-in-20 after “adjusting our calculations to account for larger object sizes” from 5 to 10 meters.</p>
<p>The odds were changed again in a LeoLab tweet before 11 a.m. Wednesday:&nbsp;“Our latest update this morning for IRAS/GGSE 4 shows a 12-meter miss distance, with a probability of collision back to 1-in-100,” it said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That would mean the satellites would miss each other by as little as 13 yards — or&nbsp;three yards longer than a first down in football.&nbsp;The time of closest approach of the two satellites is 6:23:35&nbsp;p.m. Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither LeoLab nor NASA officials could be reached for direct comment. <a href="https://www.space.com/satellite-near-collision-miss-over-pittsburgh.html" target="_blank">Space.com</a> said the satellites are traveling at 32,800 mph and if they do collide, debris would remain in space for decades. So area residents need not seek cover, at least for now.</p>
<p>The IRAS — Infrared Astronomical Satellite —&nbsp;“was the first mission to put a telescope in space to survey the sky in infrared,” <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/infrared-astronomical-satellite-iras/" target="_blank">NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> states on its website.</p>
<p>“It made a number of unexpected discoveries” — six new comets, the core of our galaxy, and evidence of solid material around the stars Vega and Fomalhaut, which strongly suggested the existence of planetary systems around other stars.”</p>
<p>After a 10-month mission, the space telescope used up its cryogen, a substance used to create low temperatures, and ceased operations Nov.&nbsp; 21, 1983, it said.</p>
<p>NASA’s website states that the GGSE 4 — a Gravity Gradient Stabilization Experiment test satellite — was launched in 1967 by the U.S. Air Force from the Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a Thor Agena-D rocket.</p>
<p>“This series developed designs and deployment techniques” later applied to reconnaissance satellites, it said. It is not clear when it stopped functioning.</p>
