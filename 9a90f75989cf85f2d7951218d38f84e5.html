<h1>Penn State's Jordan Sutherland enters uncertain season with plenty of motivation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Motivation comes in different forms for athletes. Some are motivated by dreams of professional success, the thrill of competing at the highest level drives others.</p>
<p>Penn State safety Jonathan Sutherland finds inspiration from a letter that would've discouraged a lot of men. Last season, a Penn State alum sent the 5-foot-11, 198-pounder a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/psu/2019/10/08/penn-state-football-jonathan-sutherland-letter-alumni-james-franklin/stories/201910080147" target="_blank">dispatch that referred to his dreadlocked hair</a>&nbsp;as awful, among other vulgar words about his appearance.</p>
<p>Sutherland told reporters on Thursday that he still has the letter that was signed by an alleged fan. He keeps as a reminder of how vicious the world can be when it comes to its treatment of Black people.</p>
<p>"Honestly, when I first read the letter, it was upsetting and everything," Sutherland said via Zoom conference. "But you know, I feel like just having it as a reminder, it reminds me of all the support that I've got behind my back and how much we, as a society, need to progress in the right direction."</p>
<p>Sutherland keeps the letter because he knows that it's yet another example of a Black man's life in America. He's glad to discuss it because he knows that even as a football player, something as trivial as his hair could cause ire.</p>
<p>"We have guys from all different cultures, all different ethnicities on the team," Sutherland said. “We've had great dialogue with one another, expressing the concern. We show how we may be feeling or whatnot. We talk about what we can do to educate ourselves overall and try to fight this racial inequality that's going on in this country.”</p>
<p>Sutherland spoke to reporters less than an hour before the Big Ten conference announced that the schools would play a conference only schedule. The season was slated to start with Kent State. Now that game is gone, along with matchups with San Jose State and Virginia Tech. Sutherland expressed a bit of cautious optimism about the upcoming season while acknowledging that more cancellations could be coming.</p>
<p>"If the season doesn't end up happening, obviously, not even for me, the whole team, we put in so much work here, and not being able to play, it would be horrible," Sutherland said. "Because you know that hard work kinda went into nothing."</p>
<p>Sutherland was also open to not playing in the fall and waiting until the spring for games.</p>
<p>"As far as the season occurring in the spring," Sutherland said, "if that's what we have to do, then that's what we have to do."</p>
<p>Sutherland left his Ottawa home a couple of weeks ago to return to Penn State. He's working out and hoping for a season — hoping to support his teammates on the field the way they helped him off it.</p>
<p>"I feel like the support I got from my teammates and everyone in this organization was great," Sutherland said. "I didn't feel alone at all. I felt like everyone had my back. Everyone was willing to fight for me. I appreciated it for sure."</p>
<p>Events like the murders of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor have run rampant in the news with the pandemic as the backdrop. Sutherland noted that several teammates wanted to talk about the world, and he was thankful that head coach James Franklin facilitated the dialogue.</p>
<p>"Coach Franklin and his staff do a great job of being open and having those tough conversations with us," Sutherland said, "We've had Zoom meetings with more than two-thirds of the team joining to discuss these issues going on.</p>
<p>"I don't think a lot of programs in the country have done that. So that's just one example out of many of our coaches, you know, being great role models and allowing us to have these conversations that need to be had."</p>
