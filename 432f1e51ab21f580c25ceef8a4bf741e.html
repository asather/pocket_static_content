<p>A drag race driver was killed Friday afternoon when the vehicle he was operating on the track at Keystone Raceway in Derry Township made an abrupt right turn, struck a guiderail and a light pole, then overturned multiple times, Westmoreland County Coroner Kenneth A. Bacha reported.</p>
<p>Killed was James R. Baker, 69, of Alpine Drive, Monroeville. He was pronounced dead at 3:36 p.m. at&nbsp;Excela Latrobe Emergency Department.</p>
<p>Keystone Raceway, which has featured professional and amateur car races since 1968, was hosting the weekend CARS Protection Plus 660 Bulb Nationals on&nbsp;its 1/4-mile drag strip at 538 Stone Jug Rd.</p>
<p>According to the coronerâ€™s office, Mr. Baker was&nbsp;the operator and lone occupant of a non-street legal 1936 Ford Roadster when the accident occurred. Mr. Baker was&nbsp;utilizing a helmet, a harness and&nbsp;other safety equipment.</p>
<p>The cause and manner of death are pending an autopsy Sunday by&nbsp;Dr. Cyril H. Wecht and Pathology Associates, and an investigation by state police. The Vaia Funeral Home in Delmont will be in charge of arrangements.</p>
