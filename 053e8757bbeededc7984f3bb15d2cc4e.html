<h1>Bloomsburg fair criticized for transphobic dunk tank mocking Pa. health secretary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pennsylvania fair has come under fire for featuring a dunk tank that mocked State Health Department Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bloomsburg Fair hosted a Fireman’s Relief Carnival on Friday and Saturday. On Monday, the fair posted photos to its Facebook page of a dunk tank with a man wearing a wig and a dress meant to resemble Dr. Levine, a transgender woman.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Dr. Levine? Thank you. You were a hit and raised a lot of money for the local fire companies,” the caption read.&nbsp;“Wonder why so many were trying to dunk you.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bloomsburg is located in Columbia County, about 40 miles southwest of Wilkes-Barre.</p>

<p>After social media backlash from groups like the Pennsylvania Equality Project, the post was taken down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Today the Bloomsburg Fair decided to dress a man up in woman’s clothing in a sad attempt to personally attack our wonderful Secretary of Health, Dr. Rachel Levine,” PEP said in a Facebook post. “They called it a fundraiser but you should know, they also call their fair “Family Friendly”. After today’s action, it’s obvious they are not family friendly.”</p>

<p>The state Department of Health said in an emailed statement that Dr. Levine does not have any comment on the dunk tank. The department referred inquiries to <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/the-pennsylvania-commission-on-lgbtq-affairs-defends-health-secretary-dr-rachel-levine-and-denounces-transphobia-in-the-commonwealth/" target="_blank">a June press release</a> from the Pennsylvania Commission on LGBTQ Affairs in regards to Dr. Levine’s efforts and denouncing transphobia in the commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Dr. Levine always serves at the pleasure of the Governor and will continue to serve under his leadership as Secretary of Health,” the statement said. “She remains laser-focused on protecting the health and well-being of Pennsylvanians as we navigate this ongoing pandemic.”</p>
<p>The offices for the Bloomsburg Fair were not open when reached for comment and their voicemail was full.</p>
<p>The fair issued a statement to WOLF-TV. In it, the fair told the Fox-affiliated station that the dunk tank was not meant to poke fun at Dr. Levine’s gender identity, although it did misspell her name throughout:</p>
<p><em>On behalf of the Bloomsburg Fair, we are responding to a series of inquiries and comments regarding using the likeness of an individual dressed as Dr. Rachel Lavine in a dunk tank at the Columbia Montour County Fireman’s Relief Carnival. The sole purpose of the dunk tank, which was operated by the Bloomsburg Fair, was to utilize the likeness of a public figure in an effort to raise monies for local fire companies. The fundraising activities of such organizations have been greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental restrictions which have been imposed, accordingly, our intention was simply an effort to raise money to assist these organizations. At no time was it the intention of the Bloomsburg Fair, anyone affiliated with the Fair, including any sponsors of the Carnival, to knowingly utilize the likeness of Dr. Lavine in a dunk tank as any form of commentary on Dr. Lavine’s transgender identity. The Bloomsburg Fair and the sponsors of the event do not endorse any comments which arose subsequent to the event which disparage Dr. Lavine’s transgender identity or any other discriminatory comments.</em></p>
<p>On Monday, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., reacted to the news on Twitter, saying, “Dr. Levine is an honorable public servant whose tireless work to keep PA safe and healthy has saved countless lives. She is owed an apology.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>State Rep. Brian Sims, a Bloomsburg University alum, said in a tweet Monday that he was&nbsp;“disgusted” by the fair’s actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“...I can’t begin to say how disgusted I am with the transphobia that occurred at, and was subsequently promoted by, the @BloomsburgFair today,” Mr. Sims said. The representative went on to call for the resignation of Randy Karschner, the president of the fair’s board of the directors.</p>
<p>Community members started <a href="https://www.change.org/p/randy-karschner-bloomsburg-fair-board-diversity-equity-inclusion-training?recruiter=450283386&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_abi&amp;utm_term=share_petition&amp;recruited_by_id=6d02daa8-d8a8-417a-9d3f-d2d62431087a&amp;utm_content=fht-23590630-en-us%3A0" target="_blank">a Change.org petition</a> calling for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion training for Bloomsburg Fair board members on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This training is necessary so that all members of the community are not only acknowledged at the fair, but also welcomed,” the petition read. It had nearly 1,100 signatures Tuesday morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June, Scott Commissioner Paul Abel <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/06/17/Scott-official-who-made-comment-about-Dr-Levine-resigns/stories/202006170130" target="_blank">resigned amid backlash</a> for his remarks aimed at Dr. Levine during a public meeting when he said he was&nbsp;“tired of listening to a guy dressed up like a woman.” The township later issued an apology letter.&nbsp;</p>
