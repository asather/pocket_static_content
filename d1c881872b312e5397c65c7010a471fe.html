<p>“As expected, we found the overwhelming majority of people and businesses across the commonwealth are voluntarily complying with the order and doing their part to stop the spread of COVID-19,” Commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police, Col. Robert Evanchick said. “This process is two phased beginning with warnings to gain voluntary compliance, followed by enforcement as necessary.”</p>
<p>If businesses do not comply with the warnings, Mr. Wolf said further enforcement could include citations, fines or license suspensions.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf has also directed the Liquor Control Board, the Department of Health, the Department of Agriculture, municipal police and local officials to use their resources to enforce the order to fullest extent of the law.</p>
