<p>For nine years, Focus Pittsburgh cranked out sweeping social services in the Hill District to needful residents from a creaky, musty, late 19th-century building on Centre Avenue.</p>
<p>The former used furniture store was 1,500 square feet of raw action. On days when food and clothes were bagged and backpacks were loaded with healthy snacks for children, the downstairs looked like a refugee center. The steps to the second floor swayed. Every small room upstairs was packed to the gills, doubling as office, storage and clinic space.</p>
<p>Today, the nonprofit has a new name and new digs in a 6,800-square-foot building.</p>
<p>It reassembled in January as the Neighborhood Resilience Project, having bought the former Hill House Association’s senior center at 2038 Bedford Ave. for $250,000, with help from foundations and corporations. It serves about 4,000 clients a year.</p>
<p>It continues to give food and clothing, free health care and help with bus passes, IDs and birth certificates. But every service now is underpinned by the growing recognition that generational trauma is the root of instability in predominantly black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The organization that Rev. Paul Abernathy founded in 2011 is striving to start a movement —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2015/09/21/Group-to-service-Pittsburgh-residents-stressed-from-violence/stories/201509210007" target="_blank">strengthening neighborhoods by helping people heal</a>.</p>
<p>“Trauma is the lens through which many people in our community see the world,” he said. “It has affected the spiritual health of the soul.”</p>
<p>Whether trauma is masked or apparent, “It is at the heart of everything we do,” he said, “to engage, heal and empower.”</p>
<p>In the new location, the food and clothing pantry has the basement to itself. Second floor space is devoted solely to the clinic, which is staffed by a rotation of volunteer physicians, dentists and psychological counselors.</p>
<p>The main room at street level is where Rev. Abernathy holds mid-day prayer service, where the music appreciation group, the story and philosophy group, the bingo and wellness groups meet.</p>
<p>Just inside the front door, volunteer Betty Rice sits at the intake table. People sign in, checking the box of the service they need.</p>
<p>One day, a young man limped in, propped on a cane. He said he had no insurance. He described his condition.</p>
<p>“Go to the state welfare office to apply for medical assistance,” Ms. Rice told him. “Bring back a letter saying you were denied. That’s how you get a free appointment.”</p>
<p>The man stepped sideways and winced, which made Ms. Rice wince. Sitting beside her, Vicky Ely, the community support specialist, picked up the phone.</p>
<p>“Are you busy?” she asked Bisrat Tesfagiorgia, the community health staffer who answered in the clinic. “There’s a young man who came in and he hasn’t had his blood thinner in two months. On a cane. Can we send him up?”</p>
<p>She nodded at the man, “OK, we can send you up.”</p>
<p><strong>Daily trauma</strong></p>
<p>Rev. Abernathy said he recognized trauma in the neighborhood after returning from combat in Iraq, where he served in the Army. His service was limited, he said, while people in the neighborhood live daily with trauma due to poverty, violence, fear of violence and racial discrimination. Left untended, he said, trauma keeps people unstable.</p>
<p>Many of the staff and volunteers understand this first-hand, bringing empathy to their roles, he said. “You don’t have to be a therapist to be therapeutic.”</p>
<p>Ms. Ely, who started as a volunteer in 2012, has a face bathed in kindness, so she spends a lot of time listening.</p>
<p>“Sometimes people open up,” she said. “They might think, ‘This looks like a lady I can talk to.’</p>
<p>“Some people are in a daze. Some are lonely. They want to be around anybody, somewhere people are.</p>
<p>“If we can get them to talk, to think, to write maybe, to recognize something,” she said. “They know if things are bad, they can come here to share and get support.”</p>
<p>She works throughout the building, including in the pantry, which is open for several hours three days a week. The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank donates food, and individuals donate clothing and children’s toys.</p>
<p>Kathy Balouris of McCandless and Brigette Nadley of Highland Park volunteer in the pantry twice a month, shelving cans and boxes. They have been doing this for five years.</p>
<p>“Our church has always been involved with this organization,” said Ms. Balouris, whose husband holds food drives at his office. “Our church kids had a food drive in December.”</p>
<p>Tena Walker began working as a receptionist in early February, calling men and women “baby” and “honey” as she logs the number of items they collect.</p>
<p>Avesta Bey, a mother of three teenagers, held two bags, one of food and one of clothing.</p>
<p>She has been a client for five years.</p>
<p>“I am supported here, yes, but I also come to praise and to worship,” she said. “I come for therapy for issues of anxiety. I volunteer with the backpack program whenever they need me. I’m at their beck and call, forever grateful. I have faced homelessness and been through it all, and they’ve been here for me. If it weren’t for a program like this, I don’t know where I’d be.”</p>
<p><strong>Block-by-block</strong></p>
<p>In 2015, the organization began an <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2016/07/24/Redevelopment-effort-in-Hill-District-targets-effects-of-long-term-trauma/stories/201607240027" target="_blank">outreach experiment</a>&nbsp;with help from Department of Human Services data, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University and funding from the McAuley Ministries Foundation and Neighborhood Allies.</p>
<p>Community organizers began meeting with residents of the 2900 block of Webster Avenue, chosen because several people were already known to the team. Over one year, the project staff and partner agencies helped residents forge a network of mutual support. Health assessments and home repairs were part of the intervention.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2017/05/28/FOCUS-Pittsburgh-Hill-District-neighbors-stress-healing-development/stories/201705280006" target="_blank">The block-by-block approach</a> has since expanded to parts of Bryn Mawr, Cherokee and Shawnee streets and an apartment building on Miller Street.</p>
<p>“We have taught our organizers to get the full context of a person’s life, to help them tell their stories to other people in their block,” Rev. Abernathy said. “With our local universities, we have been collecting research about what it means to go from being a trauma-affected community to a healthy community.”</p>
<p>Scalable data are not available yet, but the work has gotten smoother over time because people spread the word, said Tyra Townsend, the program manager.</p>
<p>“We look for leaders on each block to empower others,” she said. “That way there’s buy-in that builds our credibility.”</p>
<p>The health score data —&nbsp;which is informed in part by the residents’ own assessment of their health —&nbsp;has been encouraging, she said. The Cherokee Street block showed a 26% improvement after a year.</p>
<p>“It’s still very early to quantify,” Ms. Townsend said.</p>
<p>“But the needle is moving,” said Matt Walsh, a counselor at Duquesne University and a member of the organization’s development committee. “The intervention is working. We are seeing people reconnecting.”</p>
<p>With Duquesne University as host, the Resilience Project created the Trauma Informed Community Development Institute several years ago. It provides training sessions for nonprofit leaders in other cities who want to replicate the model. They have come from Sarasota, Fla., New Britain, Conn., Wind River, Wyo. and Crawford County, among others.</p>
<p>On Thanksgiving 2017, the outreach expanded with a mobile Trauma Response Team that arrives at the scene of fatal violence and has had contact with 500 people, Rev. Abernathy said.</p>
<p>“We want to develop data from that, to see what the impact is,” he said.</p>
<p>More than 50 years ago, the building that is now home to the Neighborhood Resilience Project was called Hill City, an iconic site in the city’s civil rights movement.</p>
<p>“We hope we can live up to that legacy,” Rev. Abernathy said. “But I am grateful we had humble origins.</p>
<p>“The condition of the old building kept us mindful of conditions many people in our community have to deal with. What was accomplished out of that building was built out of adversity. It helped us to be resilient.”</p>
