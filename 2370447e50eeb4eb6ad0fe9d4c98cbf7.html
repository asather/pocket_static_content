<h1>Vote on remote grading guidelines prompts friction on PPS board</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools board Wednesday adopted the grading guidelines the district administration put forward for the fourth quarter of the academic year as students participate in remote learning amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The guidelines would not allow any student to fail a fourth-quarter class, but the district said it expects all students to engage in remote learning.</p>
<p>The school board meeting in which the guidelines were approved — held via video conference Wednesday afternoon — grew contentious when one board member accused others of a dereliction of duty. This happened when a resolution was put forward acknowledging the board only had the responsibility to enforce grading guidelines, and it was up to the superintendent to create them.</p>
<p>“I am so disappointed that we are shirking our responsibility as elected board members to provide policy guidance to the superintendent and the administrators of this school district during this coronavirus pandemic when everything is so up in the air and in need of clear, strong guidance on policy from this board of directors,” board member Sala Udin said.</p>
<p>Several other members disagreed with Mr. Udin, including school board president Sylvia Wilson, who said the school board has never voted on grading guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Guidelines change a lot,” Ms. Wilson said. “We’ve changed guidelines many times ... There are lines of responsibility, and this is not one that falls under the umbrella of the board of education.</p>
<p>“That’s one of the things that we have to approve as a board that we don’t directly impact,” she continued. “There are certain things that we have to vote on that’s required by law to vote on, but this one in particular ... the whole responsibility falls on the superintendent.”</p>
<p>Terry Kennedy, who chairs the board’s policy committee, said her committee has added the policy to a list for review, but right now the board is beholden to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It will be reviewed, but right now, we as a board, in my opinion, we are obligated to follow every policy,” she said. “We should not be breaking policies any more than anyone else does.”</p>
<p>Board member Cynthia Falls, who introduced the resolution, said in a phone interview after the meeting that on Tuesday she decided to take a closer look at who was responsible for creating grading policy. After discussing the matter with other school board members and district administrators as well as solicitor Ira Weiss, she realized district policy dictated that it was up to the superintendent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s a procedure to follow,” she said.&nbsp;“You can’t pick and choose.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Falls said that she tried to contact all of the school board members before the meeting so her resolution would not surprise them, but she was unable to get a hold of Mr. Udin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She noted, however, that board members as well as the public have had time to provide input for the guidelines, and Superintendent Anthony Hamlet has heard from many stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Falls said she would have made certain changes to the grading guidelines if she had the power, but&nbsp;“I have faith in Dr. Hamlet and the leadership [of the district].”</p>
<p>“We’ll support him,” she said.&nbsp;“If it doesn’t work, then we’ll learn from it.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Udin said the board was “hiding behind policy” and&nbsp;“running away from the moment” at a time when the district required clarity and leadership.</p>
<p>“If we are saying that Dr. Hamlet has full responsibility for this, then Dr. Hamlet, you have full responsibility not only for this, but also the consequences that will come from it,” Mr. Udin said.&nbsp;“It’s in your lap.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The board approved the resolution that accepted the guidelines from district administration, 7-2. Mr. Udin and board member Kevin Carter voted against the plan.</p>
<p>The guidelines put forward by the administration will handle grades K-5 and 6-12 differently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students in K-5 will receive a “P” for pass and be promoted to the next grade.</p>
<p>Students in grades 6-12&nbsp;will receive whichever is higher between their third quarter grade or actual fourth quarter grade —&nbsp;with a minimum grade of 70%. Classes not covered in remote instruction will be graded based on the student’s&nbsp;third-quarter period grade — also with a minimum of 70%.</p>
<p>The district said teachers will&nbsp;determine if a student earned a higher grade through assignment participation, revision and completion.</p>
<p>Semester-long course grades will be calculated&nbsp;using the average of the third quarter and the fourth quarter grades. Students will not receive lower than 70% for the final&nbsp;grade, according to the district.&nbsp;Year-long course grades will be calculated using the average of first, second, third and fourth quarters.</p>
<p>All applicable courses will be credit-bearing, and final exams will not be administered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
