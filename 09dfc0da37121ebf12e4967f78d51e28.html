<h1>Pennsylvania resumes issuing REAL ID driver's licenses and ID cards</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation announced&nbsp;Wednesday that it has resumed processing requests for REAL ID driver’s licenses and identification cards.</p>
<p>The department stopped issuing the cards in March as part of the state’s efforts to limit interpersonal contacts to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Shortly thereafter, the federal Department of Homeland Security agreed to extend the deadline for enforcing the use of the card to get through airport security or to enter federal buildings by one year until Oct. 1, 2021.</p>
<p>The federal government required states to issue REAL ID cards&nbsp;— which are designed to be harder to duplicate&nbsp;— as part of the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It set a deadline for enforcement after several states, including Pennsylvania, balked at issuing the cards because of the cost.</p>
<p>The state began issuing the special licenses and IDs in March 2019 and has issued about 700,000 of the 1.3 million residents expected to want them.</p>
<p>The cards are voluntary, but after Oct. 1, 2021, everyone will need REAL ID, a valid passport or a military ID to pass through airport security or enter most federal buildings.</p>
<p>To obtain a REAL ID card, residents have to prove their identification to the state by presenting a certified copy of a birth certificate with a raised seal or a valid U.S. passport; a Social Security Card with their current legal name; two proofs of their current address such as a valid driver’s license or ID card, vehicle registration or current utility bills; and proof of legal name changes if that name is different than the name on the other documents.</p>
<p>Customers can present their documents at any PennDOT driver’s license center for verification and receive their new card by mail within 15 days. The state also has 12 REAL ID centers available where customers can present their documents and receive their REAL ID over the counter.</p>
<p>The REAL ID center in the Pittsburgh area is at Chartiers Valley Shopping Center on Washington Pike/Route 50 in Bridgeville, where it took part of the Phoenix Theatres complex at the rear of the center.</p>
<p>For their first REAL ID, a customer pays a one-time fee of $30 plus a renewal fee of $30.50 for a four-year noncommercial license or ID. The new license or card will be good for four years plus whatever time is left on the current license or ID.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>More information about document requirements for REAL ID, including a printable document checklist, is available on the <a title="REAL ID ducument check website" href="https://www.dmv.pa.gov/REALID/Pages/REAL-ID-Document-Check.aspx" target="_blank">document check page of the PennDOT Driver and Vehicle Services website</a>.</p>
