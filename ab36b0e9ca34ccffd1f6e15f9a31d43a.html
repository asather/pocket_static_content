After discussing with my coaches and my family, I have decided to put this dream on hold and return to Penn State for my senior year,” Castro-Fields said in his statement.&nbsp;“We have unfinished business to take care of and our unique brotherhood is something I’m not ready to relinquish. Additionally, earning a degree from Penn State is extremely important to my family and I.”&nbsp;</p><p>With senior John Reid graduating, Castro-Fields will be the most experienced corner in Penn State’s secondary next season, and it will be a group with a little something to prove. Though the Nittany Lions’ defense was altogether a strong unit, the secondary was gashed in individual games throughout the season, as they ended up allowing 251.5 passing yards per game, the 32nd-worst mark in the country.</p><p>For his part, though, Castro-Fields had a strong season, tying for the team lead in both pass breakups (8) and interceptions (2). He also finished sixth on the team with 52 tackles.&nbsp;</p><p>Penn State does have a lot of players returning who played significant roles at that position this fall, too. Freshmen Keaton Ellis, Marquis Wilson and Trent Gordon all got time when needed.</p><p>Now that he’s made his return official, there is no doubt Castro-Fields will be called upon to lead that group next season.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mike Persak: <a href="mailto:mpersak@post-gazette.com" target="_blank">mpersak@post-gazette.com</a>&nbsp;and Twitter @MikeDPersak</em></p></body></html>
