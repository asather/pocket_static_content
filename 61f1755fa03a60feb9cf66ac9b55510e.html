<h1>State election officials see finish line in focus for primary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tuesday will mark the end of a monthslong sprint by Pennsylvania officials to disease-proof the 2020 primary election in the face of COVID-19, and finally reveal the results of counties’ improvisational decision-making as some voters head to physical polling places and others —&nbsp;many others —&nbsp;wait for their mail-in ballots to be tallied.</p>
<p>On ballots across Allegheny County, for example, are one contested Congressional primary, two state Senate races, 10 state House contests, a presidential primary —&nbsp;though technically uncontested —&nbsp;and an auditor general race featuring one of their own. But perhaps more important than who’s on the ballot this year is how that ballot’s administered, and whether voters are able to safely and efficiently exercise their right to vote.</p>
<p>Though much of that will remain unknown until the end of Tuesday, it’s an undeniable fact that Pennsylvania received more mail-in ballots than most counties were prepared to process, and that voting will look different on Election Day for those who choose to vote in-person or missed the mail-in deadline.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s 67 counties will arrive at this moment in history after about 80 days of fierce advocacy for vote-by-mail, an all-hands-on-deck bureaucratic blitz to process those ballots, and a scavenger hunt for state and federal resources that some experts allege wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>The preparations for this election started days before the stay-at-home orders started to come down on counties. Pennsylvania officials began urging voters to apply for mail-in ballots in mid-March, framing it as a “valuable alternative” to in-person voting for those who question its viability when the day comes.</p>
<p>As of March 12, about 62,000 voters had requested a mail-in or traditional absentee ballot, and stakeholders anticipated those numbers to rise quickly.</p>
<p>A month and a half later, nearly 600,000 Pennsylvanians had applied, forcing many counties to expand their processing operations, bring on temporary staffers and institute weekend shifts.</p>
<p><strong>Changing the date</strong></p>
<p>For a few of those early weeks, the work was in anticipation of an April 28 primary. But just days before the statewide stay-at-home order was instituted, the Legislature unanimously passed a bill postponing the primary five weeks to June 2, and with Gov. Tom Wolf’s signature, Pennsylvania became the sixth state to move its primary to the first week of June in response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The hope, state Rep. Chris Sainato said at the time, was that Pennsylvania would “have this health crisis behind us” by June 2.</p>
<p>By many measures, it’s not, and that was apparent in Allegheny County as Election Day neared.</p>
<p>In mid-April, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald warned that holding in-person voting could be a “disaster” and risk disenfranchising voters, especially those most vulnerable. Noting that polling places could still face significant staffing shortages, he asked the governor to allow Allegheny County to send mail-in ballots to all registered voters.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf never made the move, and his spokeswoman indicated —&nbsp;at the time of Mr. Fitzgerald’s public urging —&nbsp;that there’d be several challenges of shifting to an all-mail election, including “ensuring that the elections will be accessible to registered voters with disabilities, and ensuring that registration lists are accurate in order to ensure ballots are mailed to the correct addresses.”</p>
<p>A few days later, Allegheny County officials decided that if they couldn’t send actual ballots to all registered Democrats and Republicans, they’d at least send applications with prepaid postage.</p>
<p>As May neared, the county’s board of elections —&nbsp;still anticipating poll worker shortages —&nbsp;voted to pass a resolution asking the state if it could consolidate polling places at a greater rate than the Legislature had permitted weeks earlier.</p>
<p>This the county got —&nbsp;and as a result, it will operate 147 physical polling locations on Tuesday: one in each municipality and 18 across the city of Pittsburgh. Some of the 147 locations will house multiple voting districts in separate rooms.</p>
<p>There was some pushback, including from state House Republicans who banded together in late May in a statement alleging Allegheny County consolidated polling places so drastically that it risked disenfranchising voters and endangering public health. The county responded that it sought and received the necessary state approval, was making preparations to ensure polling places are safe, and was expecting in-person turnout “far less” than in previous elections because of the large volume of mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>For those who do turn out in-person, they can expect to see tape on the floor marking social distancing and poll workers wearing masks, disinfecting equipment after every use and urging maskless voters to put one on for the safety of others.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at county headquarters, officials are allowed to open and tally the mail-in and absentee ballots beginning at 7 a.m. instead of when polls close at 8 p.m. Instituted by the Legislature, the provision was designed to give counties a jump-start on what could be a long and arduous process of openings thousands of envelopes and scanning thousands of ballots.</p>
<p>Having processed about 280,000 applications for mail-in and absentee ballots, Allegheny County elections officials deployed around the clock —&nbsp;three crews working three shifts —&nbsp;to get voters their ballots in a timely manner. They sent the last batch out late last week.</p>
<p>This came after the county publicly acknowledged in mid-May that an unknown number of voters received multiple mail-in and absentee ballots, due to what they said was the state’s voter registration “timing out” and putting already-printed mailing labels back in the queue to be printed again. Officials said they’d fix it by processing smaller batches at a time, and worked to ensure voters that no duplicates will be officially tallied —&nbsp;pointing to the identical bar codes on the duplicate labels.</p>
<p>But to some officials, it was the timeliness that worried them the most. Elections Board member and County Councilwoman Bethany Hallam expressed concerns that since voters had until one week before Election Day to request mail-in ballots, some might face issues returning them in time by the time polls close.</p>
<p>Nonprofit groups in May tried to get the state Supreme Court to extend the deadline for voters to submit their mail-in and absentee ballots, but —&nbsp;much to the delight of state and national Republican groups who had tried to get the case thrown out —&nbsp;the request was dismissed.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Elections Manager David Voye said voters who applied right before the one-week deadline should have expected to receive their ballots by this past Friday, and the county has opened up the lobby of its office building to access ballot drop-offs. The lobby of 542 Forbes Ave. will be open Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. —&nbsp;and voters also can submit their ballot directly to the office on the sixth floor during regular business hours Monday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Monumental task</strong></p>
<p>In the counties surrounding Allegheny, officials have faced many of the same hurdles, but expressed confidence recently that they had recruited enough poll workers, corralled enough sanitary equipment for polling places and had all but finished processing the bins of ballot applications. What remained to be determined was how quickly they’d be able to count all the completed ballots.</p>
<p>In any case, some stakeholders have noted that Pennsylvania’s counties had to battle a monumental task without the state and federal funding they needed.</p>
<p>A report in the final days of April, co-authored by the University of Pittsburgh Institute for Cyber Law, Policy and Security, estimated the cost of holding safe, secure and fair elections amid COVID-19 was somewhere between $79.1 million and $90.1 million. Pennsylvania received $14.2 million in federal funding from Congress’s third stimulus package, but also was able to tap into $15.1 million in separate election security grants.</p>
<p>Also in search of more money, at times, were the political candidates themselves. The act of campaigning changed as soon as the government’s restrictions went in place, and many operations were forced to go digital only. Canvassing, door-knocking and in-person organizing ceased, messages changed and fundraisers were canceled. One candidate compared it to learning how to campaign in a foreign language.</p>
<p>The results of their efforts, and those of the state and county, will be determined on Tuesday. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Visit Pennsylvania’s or Allegheny County’s website for information on polling place locations, and other frequently asked questions.</p>
