<h1>Sewickley Academy's Tim Fitzgerald claims first WPIAL golf title, Quaker Valley's Eva Bulger repeats as Class 2A girls champion</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After finishing his round at last year’s WPIAL Class 2A golf championships, Tim Fitzgerald watched from the practice green as his Sewickley Academy teammate, J.F. Aber, withstood a furious comeback from Riverside’s Skyler Fox to win the title by one stroke.</p>
<p>There wasn’t nearly as much drama involved this year, but that’s just fine with Fitzgerald. The Panthers senior shot an even-par 70 to claim his first WPIAL title Thursday afternoon at Allegheny Country Club, finishing five strokes ahead of Leechburg senior Cole Villa, who shot a 75 to finish in second place.</p>
<p>“It’s awesome,” Fitzgerald said. “Last year, I got the privilege to watch J.F. win. He’s a really good friend of mine, and that was awesome. I just really wanted to put myself in a position this year to try to accomplish something like that, and I did, so I couldn’t be happier.”</p>
<p>Fitzgerald dug himself into an early hole by starting the day with back-to-back bogeys, but it didn’t take long for him to dig himself out. He sunk a pair of birdie putts on holes No. 4 and No. 5, then hovered around even par the rest of the day as all of his competitors started to fall behind. Fitzgerald put the finishing touches on his impressive performance with a six-foot par putt on No. 18 to seal the deal.</p>
<p>“I think to watch, last year would definitely be a better year,” Fitzgerald said. “But playing, I’m very happy that I was able to win with some cushion and not have a really high-pressure putt.”</p>
<p>It was a good day all around for Sewickley Academy, which also saw sophomore Joey Mucci finish in a tie for third place after shooting a 6-over 76. Meanwhile, Panthers senior Navin Rana sank a hole-in-one on No. 15 and finished in fifth place with an 8-over 78.</p>
<p>“I had a lot of nerves,” Fitzgerald said. “To bogey the first two holes was tough, but I just tried to grind it out.”</p>
<p>Unlike in years past, there will be no Western Regional state qualifying tournament this year. Instead, the top 12 boys finishers and top six girls finishers from Thursday’s WPIAL championships automatically qualified for the PIAA individual championships, to be held Oct. 19-20 at Heritage Hills Country Club in York, Pa.</p>
<p><strong>Class 2A Girls</strong></p>
<p>About midway through the Class 2A girls championships, it appeared Quaker Valley sophomore Eva Bulger was about to run away with her second consecutive WPIAL title.</p>
<p>Bulger sat at 2-under through 11 holes and opened up a seven-stroke lead on her nearest competitor, Greensburg Central Catholic junior Meghan Zambruno, with only seven holes remaining. Still, this one was far from over.</p>
<p>Zambruno began chipping away at Bulger’s lead, making par on No. 12 and No. 13 then bogey on No. 14 while Bulger made bogey on No. 12 and double bogey on both No. 13 and No. 14. Just like that, Bulger’s lead had shrunk to three strokes with four holes to play.</p>
<p>“After I had my two doubles, I had no idea where I stood,” Bulger said. “I just thought it could be anyone’s game, so I just tried to focus on one shot at a time.”</p>
<p>Both players made par on No. 15 and No. 16, then both made bogey on No. 17, keeping them separated by three strokes going into the final hole. Zambruno then birdied No. 18 to finish at 6-over 79, putting the pressure on Bulger to make a two-putt at worst to avoid falling into a playoff.</p>
<p>Bulger then did one better, sinking a par putt to finish with a 4-over 77 for her second consecutive WPIAL Class 2A championship.</p>
<p>After making par on No. 18 to clinch the title, Bulger remained as calm, cool and collected as she was when the round began. Instead of celebrating on the green, she took the time to shake hands with Zambruno and Carmichaels’ Remmey Lohr once their rounds were complete while briefly acknowledging the applause of the crowd. Any spectators who weren’t paying attention to the leaderboard may not have even realized Bulger had won.</p>
<p>“I didn’t feel any pressure, because I knew it didn’t matter whether I won or I lost,” Bulger said. “As long as I played my game and did the best I could, that was all that mattered to me.”</p>
