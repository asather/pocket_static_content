<p>Police are searching for two men suspected in the shooting of a 17-year-old boy Friday night in Wilkins.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred just before 9 p.m. in the 100 block of Ivy Street, where police found the boy shot in the right shoulder and lower right abdomen. He was taken to a local hospital, where he is now in stable condition.</p>
<p>Detectives with the Allegheny County Police homicide section learned through interviews that the boy had driven his green Toyota Camry with the license plate HPV-4328 to a home in the 500 block of Tongalucas Street. When he got out of his car, he encountered two men unknown to him, one of whom began shooting at him shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>The two men then got into the green Camry and fled toward Turtle Creek. Police say the vehicle may have moderate to severe front end damage.</p>
<p>Detectives are still searching for the suspects and for the vehicle. Anyone with information can call the Allegheny County Police tip line at 1-833-255-8477 and callers can remain anonymous. The department can also be reached via its social media sites.</p>
