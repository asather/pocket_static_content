<h1>Peak COVID-19 daily deaths statewide to happen this week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Statewide COVID-19 mortality is expected to peak Thursday through Sunday, with 63 deaths projected for each of those days.</p>
<p>That result comes from the University of Washington’s COVID-19 <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/pennsylvania" target="_blank">model</a> for daily deaths and hospital facility requirements — including the daily need for hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators. It provides data for each state and nation. The model was created by the university’s&nbsp;Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation or IHME.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Ali Mokdad, IHME adjunct professor of epidemiology and chief strategy author for the team that created the program, said some states already are past their peak days for deaths and demand for hospital resources, including his home state of Washington.</p>
<p>“This is very encouraging news on many fronts,” he said. “Social distancing is working, and the other good news is that hospitals have been able to better manage the pandemic efficiently with less deaths and people getting out of the hospital earlier than expected.”</p>
<p>The model was created as a planning tool for health officials, including the White house, to assess available hospital resources, including total hospital and ICU beds and ventilators.&nbsp;Its totals&nbsp;represent&nbsp;three-day averages. It sometimes features dramatic peaks and valleys but accurately tracks trends over the period of weeks and months.</p>
<p>For Pennsylvania, IHME continues to predict more than 1,500 total COVID-19 deaths — 1,503 to be exact, which is about 4% lower than the 1,562 deaths it projected on April 1. On Monday, the state Department of Health listed 524 deaths with 24,199 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Deaths statewide are expected to occur for the next 38 days, the IHME model shows.</p>
<p>But the number will decline to only one or two a day during the second week of May, with the final death projected to occur on May 21.</p>
<p>Statewide, the need for respirators and ICU beds also will peak later this week but has not —&nbsp;and is not projected during the pandemic — to&nbsp;exceed statewide capacity.</p>
<p>Although notably accurate in many projections, the model has reduced it’s projections for COVID-19 deaths nationwide from&nbsp;81,000 people (through July) to its Monday projection of 61,545 total deaths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such reductions have been linked, among other reasons, to successful social distancing, sheltering in place and timely closure of schools and unnecessary businesses in many states.</p>
<p>Projection totals don’t include deaths resulting from “any resurgence at a later point or if social distancing is not implemented,” its <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america" target="_blank">website</a> states.</p>
<p>The United States already reached its peak need for hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators over the weekend but with notable shortages occurring.</p>
<p>The model says 86,379 hospital beds were occupied with COVID-19 patients last weekend, reflecting a shortage of nearly 12,700 beds.&nbsp;About 17,700 ICU beds were needed with only about 8,000 available. Ventilators in use numbered 15,414 but the model didn’t state whether there was a shortage.</p>
<p>IHME announced its model on March 26 and initially did daily totals, with totals sometimes unavailable, especially on weekends, leading to sometimes dramatic spikes.</p>
<p>That’s why IHME went to three-day averages — which smooths out&nbsp;dramatic statistical swings.</p>
<p>Mortality projections have proven to be accurate, Mr. Mokdad said, but certain changes are occurring, including a decline in the need for patients to use hospitals.</p>
<p>It raised questions whether the first wave of patients were sicker or had more underlying chronic conditions that are associated with more severe cases and mortality. Those include high blood pressure, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important question, for now, he said, is the model’s projection of zero deaths in Pennsylvania by the end of May and nationwide by late June.</p>
<p>“In Pennsylvania when you have no infections and no viruses, people will be ready to go back to normal,” he said. “The data say yes but you need to be careful about what is happening in neighboring states.”</p>
<p>West Virginia, despite being the last state to have a COVID-19 infection, is on a similar timeline as Pennsylvania with its mortality peak of five deaths to occur this week and its projected total death toll of 74. The last death in West Virginia is expected to occur early in May.</p>
<p>Ohio already reached its peak for daily deaths with fewer than 500 total deaths projected by the end of April.</p>
<p>“The other thing, when you are going back to normal it has to be very well planned and staged,” Mr. Mokdad said. “You can’t go back 100 percent — that&nbsp;shouldn’t happen. You have to have phases.”</p>
<p>But that requires more testing, plans in place to track positive cases and where they are occurring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, UPMC announced that the number of people with COVID-19 continues to grow but the expected surge that occurred elsewhere did not happen in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“As of April 9, UPMC’s nine regional testing sites conducted 7,376 tests with a positivity rate of 8%,” it said in a statement. “This rate has remained relatively stable since mid-March when doctors diagnosed the first COVID-19 case in Western Pennsylvania.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Roberts, director of the Public Health Dynamics Lab at Pitt’s Graduate School of Public Health and chairman of its Department of Health Policy and Management, said it’s good to see the curve flattening, soon to head downward.</p>
<p>The IHME model, he said, is “very well done for what it’s designed to do.”</p>
<p>Keeping it curving downward, however, requires the population statewide to keep on track with the mitigation strategy to limit the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Deaths seem to be leveling off and that’s good,” Dr. Roberts said. “But the most important thing — and&nbsp;the reason it is happening — is because people are behaving the way they should be&nbsp;behaving and are reducing the spread of the disease.”</p>
<p>Those factors include physical distancing, wearing masks and remaining at home.</p>
<p>“The peak [of deaths], when it occurs and how many people are sick isn’t a characteristic of the virus but how people respond to the virus with social distancing and bending the curve [downward],” he said.</p>
<p>“But we are nowhere near being where we need to be to achieve herd immunity” — that level of population immunity to prevent its spread, he said.</p>
