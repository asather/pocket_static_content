<h1>'The best shower I’ve ever taken': The magic behind Pirates manager Derek Shelton’s first win</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ST. LOUIS — Derek Shelton took his seat in front of a computer that was temporarily set up in the tunnel behind home plate at Busch Stadium late Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>As the Pirates manager smiled, exhaled and ran his fingers through his beer-soaked, salt-and-pepper hair, Shelton opened his postgame press conference with a question.</p>
<p>“How was your day?” Shelton said with a grin. “Mine was pretty good.”</p>
<p>That’s probably a bit of an understatement, as Shelton earned his first managerial victory when the Pirates beat the Cardinals, 5-1, to conclude a season-opening, three-game series.</p>
<p>The day was more than “pretty good” for Shelton, a baseball lifer, as it produced a long-awaited first and something he’s been fantasizing about since deciding he wanted to become a major league manager.</p>
<p>It was also wet.</p>
<p>“I got a pretty severe beer shower,” Shelton said. “I think anybody who knows me knows that I’m [ticked] that we wasted that much beer. I got baby powder, orange juice, apple juice and just about everything.</p>
<p>“It’s probably the best shower I’ve ever taken.”</p>
<p>So how exactly did we get here, with Shelton sopping wet from what amounts to a short grocery store trip?</p>
<p>It turned out to be one hell of a tale, one worth revisiting from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The natives were restless.</p>
<p>Understandably so, too.</p>
<p>The Pirates had gone down 1-2-3 in 12 of their first 18 innings and had just one extra-base hit through two games of this series. The top three bats in their order were a combined 2-for-23, while Josh Bell and Colin Moran looked like their only competent hitters. Meanwhile, the bullpen was a bigger issue, a fire simmering since the start of exhibition play.</p>
<p>Yet you wouldn’t know it from talking to Shelton, who made several changes to his lineup but presented them as having been previously scheduled. Day off for Kevin Newman. Bell to the No. 3 spot, Moran at No. 4. Jose Osuna in right field. Another start for Phillip Evans at third.</p>
<p>Trying to spark something? No way.</p>
<p>“This was scripted out,” Shelton said. “This was set before we played the first game. There was no reactionary [decision] at all on anything. It’s just not how I’m going to roll on that.”</p>
<p>By the fourth inning, it no longer looked like Shelton was on happy pills. Moran homered. Then Osuna, who may be challenging for a regular job, mashed one of his own, 429 feet into the seats beyond left-center field.</p>
<p>"When you have a good day, when you help the team to win, it's a good feeling for everybody," Osuna said.</p>
<p>But that's hardly the end. We're only getting started.</p>
<p>Rewind to the inning before, with Jarrod Dyson leading off the third. Dakota Hudson, the Cardinals starter, got a called strike on a breaking ball, one of several questionable ones for these two teams over the past three days.</p>
<p>The Pirates bench wasn't happy.</p>
<p>Neither, apparently, was pitcher Derek Holland, who was technically seated in the stands, underneath one of several green tents teams have installed to give players more room to socially distance.</p>
<p>Home-plate umpire Jordan Baker told the Pirates once to shush. When the yapping continued, Baker walked toward the visiting dugout and screamed, "You're gone."</p>
<p>In the press box, it was announced that Shelton was ejected, the manager apparently earning his first early shower before that elusive initial victory.</p>
<p>Down below, the Pirates knew their manager was safe. It was a mistake. Holland was the guilty party.</p>
<p>"I was pretty parallel with Holland, so I knew where it was coming from," Evans said. "Fired me up."</p>
<p>Then it blew up online.</p>
<p>In the COVID-19 era, this apparently qualifies as a highlight. Before sticking up for his pitcher — who, by the way, was ejected before his first Pirates start — Shelton tugged a mask over his face. Baker strapped his on before it broke. They tried to stay six feet apart.</p>
<p>The whole thing was ... awkward.</p>
<p>"When I went out there later, we kind of got a chuckle out of it that it was the first time,” Shelton said, “We just made sure to stay away from each other.”</p>
<p>Did Holland's antics ignite the Pirates?</p>
<p>"I think Holland’s going to tell you it was 100% him, but I would say it was that we took good swings," Shelton said. "If Holland wants to say it’s on him, we’ll definitely let him say that. That’s fine.”</p>
<p>Forgot those aforementioned natives, the fans. The Pirates themselves were restless.</p>
<p>Losing three to the Cardinals, in a 60-game season, works out to roughly an eight-game losing skid, something a team like the Pirates surely must avoid.</p>
<p>That thought was rattling around the head of 24-year-old Mitch Keller before he jogged to the mound in the bottom of the first inning Sunday afternoon, the Pirates' fortunes pushing down on his shoulders.</p>
<p>"I made a point to myself that we needed a win," Keller said.</p>
<p>Keller breezed through the first on eight pitches, the quickest inning of his career. He walked two to start the second but got a double-play ball and ceded his only run in the third, when he was late covering first base.</p>
<p>None of that mattered, of course. And neither did the fact that Keller's fastball sat well below normal; on a hot and muggy afternoon, Keller's four-seamer averaged 92 mph, well below its 2019 mark of 95.4.</p>
<p>"Definitely velocity wasn’t up, but I just trusted [Jacob] Stallings," Keller said. "We had a good game plan and kept them off-balance."</p>
<p>That game plan involved a total of 33 curveballs and sliders, plus four changeups among the 87 pitches Keller threw. While last season Keller often looked overmatched or nervous, even on days when he had his best stuff, Sunday he looked different.</p>
<p>Almost like he knew he belonged.</p>
<p>"That’s probably the most important point of this game," Shelton said. "We’re talking about a 24-year-old kid. We’re down, 0-2. The manager doesn’t have his first win.</p>
<p>“For him to go out there, execute and make pitches ... most importantly what I take out of the game is another maturation step for Mitch Keller.”</p>
<p>When Shelton took over, it was believed that the bullpen would be one of the Pirates’ strengths.</p>
<p>Much like everything else he's encountered, reality has not aligned with expectations.</p>
<p>Through three exhibition games and two regular-season contests, the bullpen had been a mess.</p>
<p>Edgar Santana was suspended. Keone Kela has been missing, his COVID-19 tests positive or inconclusive. Kyle Crick and Richard Rodriguez have scuffled.</p>
<p>In those five games, Pirates relievers combined to allow 25 runs while coughing up a total of seven homers to the Indians and Cardinals.</p>
<p>But with the Pirates nursing a three-run lead and Keller tiring, Shelton turned to JT Brubaker, a heck of a spot for his major league debut.</p>
<p>Although Brubaker has always been a starter, the day before the final exhibition game Shelton called Brubaker into his office and said he made the team ... as a reliever.</p>
<p>Situations like these would be his.</p>
<p>Brubaker responded by giving the Pirates two scoreless innings, sawing through the meat of the Cardinals order with a nasty slider and piling up four strikeouts.</p>
<p>“Keller threw a hell of a game,” Brubaker said. “It was awesome to watch him go out there and dominate. It was a momentum builder for me to where I just had to go out there, build off of that and pitch my game.”</p>
<p>After Brubaker, the baton went to Michael Feliz, who flashed an improved slider and gave the Pirates a 1-2-3 eighth. Nick Burdi then made his bid for a potential closing role by striking out the side in the ninth.</p>
<p>Against 3-4-5 in the Cardinals lineup to boot.</p>
<p>"I think you have to have confidence in your guys and the way that they have performed, giving them the opportunity to do the job," Shelton said. "They came out, and they were really sharp."</p>
<p>Although the Pirates will surely try to ride this momentum as they prepare for their home opener Monday, the excitement for Sunday’s win will be washed off by then, the same as the beer, apple juice and everything else Pirates players dumped on Shelton.</p>
<p>It’s just the way the daily rhythms of baseball work. But the memory, for Shelton and his players alike, will certainly remain.</p>
<p>"Just having him come in the clubhouse and we all celebrated with him, that was a really cool experience," Keller said. “Felt like it was my first win again. It was fun to be a part of on the other end — just not necessarily in the beer shower.</p>
