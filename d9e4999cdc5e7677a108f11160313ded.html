<h1>Amid pandemic, school districts in southwestern Pa. are learning as they go</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Like the proverbial project of building a plane while flying it, area school districts have been adapting to a school year like no other.</p>
<p>They’ve launched with a range of formats — from online learning to in-person but socially distant classrooms to some hybrid of the two. Staff and families are experiencing various combinations of enthusiasm, stress and exhaustion as they navigate education amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“Teachers have worked extremely hard and our administrators and board have worked extremely hard,” said Superintendent Todd Keruskin of the Elizabeth Forward School District. There, most students have begun with a hybrid of in-person and online classes, with others fully online.</p>
<p>They’re working “to bring back some normalcy,” to the school experience, he said. “It’s going to take a while. We’re changing a model in public education” to one “that’s never occurred before.”</p>
<p>Across southwestern Pennsylvania, some educators have reported success in bringing mask-wearing students into well-scrubbed classrooms equipped with hand-sanitizing stations and socially distant desks — and in bringing the classroom experience to students at home through a range of online tools.</p>
<p>At the same time, some districts are still working to get the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/08/05/Pittsburgh-Public-Schools-students-district-devices/stories/202008050169" target="_blank">needed computers or tablets</a> into the hands of students.</p>
<p>Some parents have voiced frustration over the inconsistent quality and guidance from remote instruction.</p>
<p>Some online tools have at times been overloaded or even hacked, though most schools reported smooth starts.</p>
<p>And school officials worry about COVID-19 exposures taking a toll on teachers at a time when substitutes are in short supply.</p>
<p>Some schools have had virus exposures already. A <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/09/09/Plum-Borough-School-District-employee-tests-positive-COVID-19/stories/202009090188" target="_blank">Plum Borough School District employee tested positive and came in contact with three other people</a>, who were asked to self-quarantine. Serra Catholic High School in McKeesport <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/09/10/2-positive-COVID-19-tests-students-Serra-Catholic-High-School-Pittsburgh-online-learning/stories/202009100179" target="_blank">shifted to three days of online-only classes after two students tested positive</a> for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Last spring, schools had to improvise with remote learning following the sudden onset of the pandemic. While the summer gave them some time to plan for the new school year, they’re still finding their way.</p>
<p>Superintendent Gary Peiffer of the Greensburg Salem School District in Westmoreland County — where most students are studying under a hybrid of in-person and online instruction — said the rollout of this format would have taken two years if not for the urgency of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“I have to give credit to all the teachers and the school board for doing this in such a short amount of time,” he said. “We expect we’re going to have to make adjustments.”</p>
<p>At Tuesday’s videoconference meeting of the Chartiers Valley school board, some parents described an inconsistent quality in the online portion of the school’s hybrid format. One parent said it “seems that I’m the teacher” because her child is getting little online guidance. Superintendent Johanna Vanatta acknowledged initial “bumps in the road” but said the district is working to improve delivery and encouraged parents to bring concerns to teachers.</p>
<p>Butler Area School District Superintendent Brian White said the first week has revealed that “teachers are already absolutely overwhelmed. I’m not sure how sustainable that is. They were busy before, and one of the key pieces of what they do is to build relationships.”</p>
<p>That’s harder, he said, when they have to bounce from in-person to remote learning.</p>
<p>Butler Area schools opened with about 70% of students in school full time, the rest choosing either online-only or a hybrid model.</p>
<p>The board hired 26 substitutes to be in the schools every day, doubled from last year.</p>
<p>Students are required to wear masks, Mr. White said, but some classrooms are not equipped for 6 feet of distance between everyone.</p>
<p>Mr. White said he is concerned about potential burnout among staff.</p>
<p>“Plus, there is underlying anxiety,” he said. “No one wants to get sick or make anyone else sick.”</p>
<p>Mr. Keruskin said Elizabeth Forward teachers have had several years of experience giving lessons on digital platforms. “It wasn’t trying to flip a switch to make it work” all at once, he said.</p>
<p>Merecedes Williams, a spokesperson for the Pittsburgh Public Schools — which launched its school year fully online — said remote learning has gone more smoothly after some first-day internet bottlenecks. The district still has computer devices available for families in need, she said.</p>
<p>PPS blocked student access to a website, SafeYouTube.net, after users in the district and elsewhere around the country found video links that had been hacked, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/09/09/Pittsburgh-public-Schools-district-inappropriate-video-safeyoutube-net-anthony-hamlet-response/stories/202009090154" target="_blank">leading to inappropriate sites</a>.</p>
<p>The Trinity Area School District in Washington County postponed live Zoom instruction after a hacker made offensive comments during Zoom class sessions. Police are investigating, and the district is “in contact with Zoom to understand how this breach could occur and what can be done to trust this platform again.”</p>

<p><strong>‘Different look … same feel’</strong></p>
<p>The Allegheny Intermediate Unit, which runs dozens of early childhood classes across Allegheny County, began Tuesday with classrooms capped at 10 children, with more following online.</p>
<p>“While it has a different look, it has the same feel,” said Chris Rodgick, director of the unit’s Early Childhood Education section, which includes Head Start and Pre-K Counts programs serving 1,417 students. She said the class locations had familiar scenes of eager children and parents choking up at the milestone of dropping off a child at school.</p>
<p>The unit also provides special education classes at three locations. Students are spending more time in the same classroom to avoid moving through crowded hallways.</p>
<p>There are “definitely some procedural differences, but overall the students are adapting well,” said Brian Welles, assistant director for special education and people services for AIU. Teachers had anticipated the need to introduce mask-wearing more gradually to students with sensitivities such as to touch, but “many more students successfully are wearing masks throughout the day than we anticipated.”</p>
<p>The Beaver Valley Intermediate Unit provides educational support service to 14 districts in Beaver County and operates the New Horizon School in Beaver for almost 200 students.</p>
<p>Eric Rosendale, the unit’s executive director, said that after 11 days, the in-person schooling at New Horizon is “going very well. ... Knock on wood. Everyone is following protocols — wearing masks, washing hands, maintaining distances.”</p>
<p><strong>Substitute problem</strong></p>
<p>The perennial problem of finding enough substitutes is more worrying during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Our districts have been creative in finding solutions, including having guest teachers who can be certified if they have a four-year degree and offering higher rates of pay,” Mr. Rosendale said.</p>
<p>In the North Hills School District, which began entirely online, students are following the schedules they would have in person, said Heather Pelat, director of communications.</p>
<p>Teachers are giving instruction synchronously, or live, from their classrooms.</p>
<p>“You walk down the hall, you hear them teaching, but there are no students,” Ms. Pelat said. “They’re working really hard, and they just want to see their kids again” in person.</p>
<p>At the Bethel Park School District, which began with most students online only, there have been some challenges with internet bandwidth, but “for the most part, the feedback has been positive, and everyone understands that we’re just trying to make the best out of a difficult situation,” said James Cromie, director of public relations.</p>
<p>In Greensburg Salem, Mr. Peiffer, the superintendent, said the district has enough teachers and support service workers, including those driving buses and providing food.</p>
<p>At each school, the students are divided alphabetically, with one group going to school Mondays and Tuesdays, another on Thursdays and Fridays. Students learn from home the other days of the school week.</p>
<p>“I do worry about whether we have enough substitutes if we see another spike” in local COVID-19 cases, Mr. Peiffer added. “But we have enough subs so far.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Still in short supply are computers for every student learning remotely because of federal delays. In the meantime, he said, the priority is to distribute computers to children who don’t have them.</p>
<p>Students in Beaver Area High School are all learning online remotely while kindergartners through eighth graders are in school two days a week and learning remotely the other three.</p>
<p>She said students have all had their own computers supplied for about 10 years.</p>
<p>But high school students are all learning remotely in part because of a shortage of teachers, some of whom are on leave after elective surgeries that they had to put off earlier in the year.</p>
<p>“The substitute issue has plagued us,” Ms. Rowe said. “We have increased the daily rate from $85 to $100 and the longer-term substitute rate from $105 a day to $120, and we have gotten some interest but not seen a major increase. This points to a problem to come.”</p>
<p>In the Washington School District, one-third of students have opted to start the year learning remotely every day, said Superintendent James Konrad.</p>
<p>The district is made up of two school buildings in Washington, Pa.: one for kindergarten through sixth grade and one for junior and senior high students. Students who chose the hybrid option are in classrooms two days a week and learn remotely three days.</p>
<p>The schools are deep- cleaned every day, Mr. Konrad added.</p>
<p>“We can minimize risk at the schools, but we have no control outside the school,” he said.</p>
<p>And for the region’s largest private school network?</p>
<p>“So far, so good,” said Michelle Peduto, director of Catholic schools for the Diocese of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“Everyone seems to be taking the changes in stride,” she said in a statement. “There is a sense of calm in our buildings as students and teachers adjust to being face to face after nearly six months.”</p>
<p>Still, she said, “there is a cloud of COVID-19 hanging over all of us, which motivates us to stay vigilant with our health and safety plans and to pray continuously.”</p>
