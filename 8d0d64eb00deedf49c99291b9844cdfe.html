<h1>Robert Hill: Sex, lies and candidates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Voters who take sexual assault against women serious enough to regard the offenses as disqualifying for those seeking elected office are depressed over the choice of 2020 presumptive candidates for president of the United States.</p>
<p>Incumbent President Donald Trump seeks re-election amid old and new accusations of varying degrees of sexual misconduct leveled by at least 25 women, rendering him self-disqualified to be retained as president in the minds of many of those who believe the women.</p>
<p>But Democrat contender former Vice President Joe Biden is dogged by eight women accusers, one emerging in recent weeks to level the most serious complaint. His supporters, even those seeking selection as Mr. Biden’s running mate, are now challenged to apply the same disqualifying sexual misconduct standard they have applied to Democratic and Republican office holders and seekers alike. None was a Democratic candidate for president of the United States, however.</p>
<p>Of course, apart from the #MeToo claims, neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Biden is fit to be president of the United States.</p>
<p>Long before he availed himself of the opportunity to mightily mismanage the U.S. response to the COVID-19 epidemic, Mr. Trump’s racism, mendacity, corruption, emoluments violations, loyalty to Russia’s murderous Vladimir Putin and other dictators, as well as his ignorance of constitutional provisions, among other transgressions, substantiate Mr. Trump’s unsuitability.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s propensity to plagiarize others’ work, dating as far back as his law school days and his embrace of 20th-century school segregation are among his most serious offenses. But it is Mr. Biden’s botched management of Justice Clarence Thomas’ Supreme Court nomination, which occurred when Mr. Biden served as chair of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, is his most distressing act. He egged on the prim accuser of Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill, to immodestly specify, in graphic terms, her claim of sexual harassment against then-Judge Thomas. All this conspires against the former vice president’s qualifications to lead America.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, Mr. Trump stands to be nominated for re=election and Mr. Biden will be the Democratic standard bearer. Their matchup portends a battle of the accused of Dickensian proportions. Mr. Trump’s Edward Murdstone persona has simply dismissed his accusers as liars, unworthy of rape, and he threatened empty lawsuits for defamation against the women.</p>
<p>With his creepy Uriah Heep demeanor, Mr. Biden, under withering questioning by MSNBC’s Mika Brzenzski, slid from his position that the woman should be believed when others are accused, and he arrived at “believed” merely means “heard” when it comes to charges against him. And once heard and investigated, the woman, the accuser in his case, should be politely dismissed as lying.</p>
<p>But unlike the fictional David Copperfield characters, Messrs. Trump and Biden are real-world foes in a contest to command the most powerful role in the world from 2021 to 2025. Were it not for Tara Reade’s charges, the Biden campaign might have finally hammered Mr. Trump in the face of his sexual confessions and offenses.</p>
<p>In the 2016 presidential race, Democratic candidate Hilary Clinton was effectively blocked from doing so by the opposing Trump camp’s cleverly presenting a panel of accusers of her fidelity-challenged husband, former President Bill Clinton, at a presidential debate. By Election Day 2016, Trumpsters maintain that sex accusations against the Republican — as well as his Access Hollywood sex crimes confession — were baked into the electoral cake. Yet, the New York television performer still victoriously emerged as president.</p>
<p>In her inaugural news conference on May 2, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany promised never to lie to the press. She then lied almost immediately, declaring all sex claims against the president to be old pre-2016 ones. Actually, in a much reported account from January 2020, writer E. Jean Carroll described a mid-1990s rape by Mr.Trump in a Bergdorf Goodman store dressing room. It is the most serious sex crime alleged against Mr. Trump to date. He has denied the allegation. Ms. Carrol seeks — without success thus far — Mr. Trump’s DNA in an associated lawsuit. Here, tell-tale science would trump and settle any he said/she said lie.</p>
<p>Many of my fellow liberal travelers are too anti-Trump to judge fairly the accusations against Mr. Biden. But Ms. Reade’s 2020 account that Mr. Biden sexually assaulted her in a Capital Hill hallway in 1993 is merely the latest in her evolving set of recriminations against the former senator and vice president, leaving some gaps that cry out for answers.</p>
<p>Hints at voter preference have surfaced against the backdrop of the recent Biden sex scandal. A May 6 Monmouth University presidential preference poll of registered voters reports the Democrat leading the Republican 50% to 41%; the 56% Biden preference among women leads a 36% Trump preference. Roughly a third of the voters believe the Reade/Biden assault claim, a third disbelieve and a third do not know what to believe. But, in the six-month-long slog between now and Election Day, minds, polls and developments can change.</p>
<p>As a communicator, I’ve had to admit my failure here at forensic communications. From language utilization analysis, my would-be ahah moment — harshly, in the president’s case; gently, in the former vice president’s case. “This did not happen” marked the denials. Why do we not hear what Harvard’s Terry Deal calls the direct denial: “I did not rape/assault the woman?”</p>
<p>But then I recalled President Bill Clinton’s bold and forceful denial of sexual impropriety with White House intern Monica Lewinsky: “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.” Later that same year, President Clinton admitted to sexual relations with that woman. So much for the direct denial.</p>
