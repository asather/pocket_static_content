<p>BRADENTON, Fla — Pirates shortstop prospect Oneil Cruz made his intentions clear when he showed up to Pirate City on Friday.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old isn’t a talkative man, so when he speaks, it catches your attention. Cruz was asked about his goals for 2020 and gave a firm answer.</p>
<p>“My goal is to make it to the big leagues this year,” Cruz said through Pirates interpreter Mike Gonzalez. “I want to do everything possible to make it to the big leagues this year.”</p>
<p>These are bold words from any athlete in their first big league camp. They’re even brighter when a player hasn’t played above Class AA. But Cruz is extraordinarily talented, and there are reasons to believe he is on the right track.</p>
<p>“The hype with him isn’t really hype. He’s that good,” Pirates pitching prospect Cody Ponce said. “He’s very young, and he’s only going to get better as time goes. He’s got a lot of pop in his bat and is a smooth fielder. When he makes good contact with the ball, it is going to go a long way.”</p>
<p>According to Fangraphs, Cruz is the 32nd-best prospect in baseball. He plays shortstop and does it well, but the question is, will he stay there?</p>
<p>Cruz may be the rare man in history who’s taller than his profile lists. The Pirates have Cruz listed at 6-foot-6 and 210 pounds. But he slightly towers over Ponce, whom the Pirates list at 6-6 as well. Ponce fondly remembers the first time he saw Cruz play shortstop.</p>
<p>“I think he gets taller every time I see him,” Ponce told the Post-Gazette with a smile. “He’s gotta be 6-8. You see this super tall guy run out to shortstop and it barely takes him four strides to get there.”</p>
<p>Ponce became more impressed when he saw Cruz in the field.</p>
<p>“A guy that tall isn’t supposed to have the range he does,” Ponce said. “He moves like a 5-10 guy. The kid has so much ability. When he puts it all together, he will be a star. You don’t see guys at his size be able to pick it the way he does.”</p>
<p>The question about Cruz being able to be a shortstop in the show doesn’t linger for him. He’s confident he can remain at the position and do well.</p>
<p>“I’m focused on playing short,” Cruz said. “It’s the most fun position to play on the field. I love all of the action. I don’t want to play anywhere else.”</p>
<p>Pirates outfield prospect Jared Oliva is also a believer in Cruz.</p>
<p>“He’s super talented. He has a great arm and great range,” Oliva said. “It catches your attention to see a guy that big move with ease he does. He’s so quick. I love watching him at shortstop. He’s a great guy to have on your team.”</p>
<p>Cruz has unique skills. But, he, like every player, has factors working against him. Plate discipline continues to be a challenge. Being in big league camp will help because Cruz will get time with hitting coach Rick Eckstein.</p>
<p>Also, there have only been three players over 6-5 to start a game at shortstop in the majors. Cruz would be the tallest. Of course, Cruz is undeterred by all of this.</p>
<p>He ended the conversation with the assembled reporters Friday reaffirming how much he believes in his ability to reach his goals.</p>
<p>“For me,” Cruz said. “There’s nothing impossible.”</p>
