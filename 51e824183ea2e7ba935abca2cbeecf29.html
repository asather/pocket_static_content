<h1>Toomey blames bureaucratic 'bottlenecks' for testing delays in Pennsylvania; urges passage of stimulus deal</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON — Bureaucratic hurdles have delayed the widespread deployment of COVID-19 testing and hampered Pennsylvania laboratories developing their own testing kits, Sen. Pat Toomey told reporters Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey added that in recent days — and after a phone call to a top federal health official&nbsp; —&nbsp;he had helped to speed up testing at three hospital laboratories in the state by easing the central roadblock: access to a virus sample from the National Institutes of Health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three health systems — Lehigh Valley Health Network, Temple University Hospital and Penn State Health Medical Group Laboratory in Hershey — can now access all the components within one or two days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think it’s fair to say (we) have broken through most of those bottlenecks,” Mr. Toomey said. “The hospitals in Pennsylvania who have the ability and have the desire to develop their own test kits, for the most part, that is underway.”</p>
<p>“It does not mean that, overnight, we can have unlimited tests,” he cautioned.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s frustrations highlighted the challenges in the Trump administration’s response weeks into a widening global pandemic in the United States. As testing becomes more prevalent, cases of COVID-19 are on the rise. In Allegheny County, there were 10 confirmed or presumed cases as of noon Tuesday.</p>

<p>Brett P. Giroir, an assistant secretary of health, said during a White House press briefing Tuesday that tens of thousands of tests had been distributed, with a “dramatic ramp” of testing in the last 24 hours. Fewer than 60,000 Americans have received a test, White House officials said.</p>
<p>The administration is working to set up 47 drive-thru testing facilities&nbsp;“over the next few days,” with most cities hosting the locations, Mr. Giroir said.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey said his office received calls from state health facilities as recently as two weeks ago about struggles to obtain tests and develop their own.</p>
<p>“We had huge obstacles” in the early weeks of the virus,&nbsp;Mr. Toomey said. “And we were doing very, very few tests.”</p>
<p>Ronald Walsh, the clinical laboratory director at Health Network Laboratories in the Lehigh Valley Health Network, said the initial testing kits sent to state labs by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contained technical difficulties, requiring a new batch of test kits that were sent out to state labs.</p>
<p>Mr. Walsh, who joined Mr. Toomey on Tuesday’s call,&nbsp;said hospital providers also were required to present individual patients to the CDC and state labs to determine if testing was indeed necessary — and “that was restrictive as well.”</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey said he complained to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health, who has been one of the most public faces of the administration’s response.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘We just heard it’s gonna take two to three weeks for our hospital system to even be able to validate these tests — that’s not acceptable,’ ” Mr. Toomey recalled telling Dr. Fauci in a late-night phone conversation, which occurred the first week of March. “He agreed that’s not acceptable.”</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s comments come as the Senate is expected to vote on an emergency aid package that would help American workers and the health care system.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey said he has reservations about that bill, saying he opposed the mechanism by which paid sick leave and paid family benefits were doled out by the federal government.&nbsp;He said he would prefer seeing those benefits be paid out by the unemployment insurance system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The measure would be the second bill to respond to the crisis, after Congress passed an $8.3 billion aid package two weeks ago. As part of that package, the Trump administration awarded <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/03/12/coronavirus-Pennsylvania-funding-CDC-Trump-administration-17-million-COVID-19/stories/202003120126?cid=search" target="_blank">nearly $17 million to Pennsylvania</a>, and an additional $3.5 million to Philadelphia. That money should arrive for state and local health departments by Friday, according to a CDC spokesperson.</p>
<p>The Senate’s deliberations comes amid talk of a third package requested by the White House for $850 billion in stimulus aid to help the U.S. economy, which has ground to a halt amid orders to shut down businesses and cancel all nonessential travel. The Washington Post first reported on the third package on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey signaled his support for that broader package, which he expected to provide financial support for critical infrastructure industries and small businesses.</p>
<p>“The crisis that we’re facing is not the fault of the business that didn’t plan well,” he said. “I don’t think of this as bailouts in the sense that someone’s getting rewarded for their bad behavior. This is more akin to an invasion and our society going on a war footing to fight off this pathogen.”</p>
<p>“A group of us is in pretty intense discussions with the Treasury secretary right now,” he added.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., has called for greater support from the federal government for seniors and children. Mr. Casey signed a letter with other Senate Democrats in pressing the Trump administration to assist early care and education providers to operate safely.</p>
<p>“Child care is essential for our economy and for the working families who need to know their children are safe and well cared for so they can go to work every day and provide for their families,” the senators wrote.</p>
