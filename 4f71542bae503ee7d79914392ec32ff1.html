<h1>Police issue arrest warrants for former Pittsburgh residents charged with rape, child abuse</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh police on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for an Ingram woman and New Castle man after charging them with multiple felonies for the alleged sexual abuse of two minors police say happened several years ago in the city.</p>
<p>Trista Price and Seth Aaron Price, both 36 years old, are accused of more than 15 felonies each. Those crimes include rape; aggravated assault; false imprisonment; endangering the welfare of children; sexual abuse of children including photographing and videotaping; corruption of minors; involuntary deviate sexual intercourse; and others, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Police began an investigation into the claims back in August, and a month later, viewed interview footage where the now teenage victims shared with authorities that they had been raped by adults, and forced to have sex with one another when they were between 4 and 7 years old.</p>
<p>The alleged abuse occurred in 2009 at a home in Carrick, a criminal complaint said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The female juvenile told authorities she was forced to perform sexual acts while her hands and feet where tied. She also has a permanent scar on her forehead due to being struck by a car, she told officials. She and the male juvenile both alleged they were beaten with various objects, including a frying pan, a fly swatter, and pieces of wood that contained a nail on the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The juveniles said they were also filmed by their abusers, a criminal complaint said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police said in December they obtained a warrant and searched Mr. Priceâ€™s home. They found child pornography on several devices, but none included the juvenile victims, police said. The files showed that the pornography was, however, downloaded around the time of the alleged sexual assaults, a criminal complaint said.</p>
