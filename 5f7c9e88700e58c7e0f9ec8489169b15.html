<p>WASHINGTON — Defending his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, an angry President Donald Trump on Friday lashed out at reporters and broke with his own health officials on the science of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump said he was tapping the Defense Production Act to order American businesses to manufacture and send supplies, like testing kits, ventilators and masks, to hospitals preparing to be overwhelmed by a wave of COVID-19 cases. But he gave conflicting accounts as to when he officially invoked the rarely used order and did not specify which companies he was marshaling for the effort. Mr. Trump had said earlier in the week he would tap the act as needed; he then added Friday that he has put that “in gear.”</p>
<p>The president also announced an effective closure of the U.S. border with Mexico, prohibiting most travel except for trade. That brings it in line with the restriction on the Canadian border earlier this week. The U.S. is also suspending interest on student loans to help young people cope with job losses and the financial crunch.</p>
<p>As Congress debated a financial relief package that could reach $1 trillion, officials again urged Americans to maintain social distancing while Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, applauded strict new measures put in place by the governors of California and New York to limit mobility.</p>
<p>But Mr. Trump and Dr. Fauci broke openly during the White House briefing on the possible effectiveness of new drugs being explored to treat the virus. Mr. Trump said he believed that a combination of medications he announced Thursday would work to treat the virus. Dr. Fauci said no such declaration could be made without testing, again highlighting the sharp divide between data-driven health officials and a president who admits he follows his gut.</p>
<p>The president spent much of the Friday briefing in a fury, sparring with reporters who he deemed were being overly critical of the response.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump scoffed at questions about continued testing shortfalls and deficiencies in medical supplies, suggesting that even mentioning the issues was problematic. When asked to speak directly to those marooned at home and frightened, Mr. Trump voiced objection to the question itself.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a very bad signal you’re putting out to the American people,” he said. “The American people are looking for answers and they’re looking for hope.”</p>
<p>Seething, he then answered the TV correspondent by declaring that what he would tell the public gripped by the health scare is: “I think you are a terrible reporter.”</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence, when asked the same question later in the briefing, responded, “Don’t be afraid, be vigilant.”</p>
<p>More than 200 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. and sickness from the disease is on the rise, with hospitals at risk of being overrun. Most people who get it have only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he implored Mr. Trump during a phone call Friday to invoke the Korean War-era act immediately to order the manufacture of ventilators and other critically needed medical gear. The president told Mr. Schumer he would, then could be heard on the telephone seeming to make the order. He yelled to someone in his office to do it now, said Mr. Schumer’s spokesman, Justin Goodman.</p>
<p>Later at the briefing, Mr. Trump said he actually invoked the measure Thursday night. He declined to reveal any companies he had ordered to step up production.</p>
<p>The president and the Cabinet officials who briefed reporters focused on the border as they moved to restrict the entry of people without documentation to the U.S. This follows a stepped-up State Department travel advisory telling Americans they should not leave the country.</p>
<p>“Americans from every walk of life are coming together,” Mr. Trump said. “We are winning and we are going to win this war.”</p>
