<h1>Sidney Crosby, Penguins organization announce plan to pay PPG Paints Arena workers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins on Friday announced a plan to pay full-time and part-time arena and service employees at PPG Paints Arena who stood to lose income after the NHL suspended its season, denying them a chance to work home games.</p>
<p>The Penguins in a press release said the funding will come from Penguins players, the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation and the Mario Lemieux Foundation.</p>
<p>“The ushers, ticket takers, concession workers, cleaning staff and other arena workers are the backbone of a Penguins hockey game at PPG Paints Arena, and a big part of the Penguins’ family,” CEO and team president David Morehouse said. “Our owners, Mario Lemieux and Ron Burkle, and our players, led by Sidney Crosby, thought it was essential to help them through this.</p>
<p>“We have come together to ensure that they will not lose pay because of the pause in our season.”</p>
<p>The NHL <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/03/12/pittsburgh-penguins-coronavirus-season-postponed-nhl/stories/202003120129" target="_blank">announced on Thursday</a> that the season was suspended due to the threat of the COVID-19. The league hopes to resume the season, but there is no timetable on when that could potentially occur.</p>
<p>Prior to the league going on hiatus, the Penguins were scheduled to play six more regular-season games at PPG Paints Arena, plus potential playoff games.</p>
<p>The Penguins were one of several NHL teams to announce Friday that they were taking steps to provide financial assistance to workers at their home arena.</p>
