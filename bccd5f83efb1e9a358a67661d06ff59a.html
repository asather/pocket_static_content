<h1>Pitt-N.C. State observations: Eric Hamilton, another late collapse in Raleigh and 'Triangle Toney'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>RALEIGH, N.C.&nbsp;— If the finality of his college basketball career hadn’t been apparent to Eric Hamilton previously, it was last Wednesday before Pitt’s 72-49 loss to Syracuse.</p>
<p>On that night, one in which he was honored alongside three of his teammates as part of the program’s senior night, Hamilton was given the full sendoff that comes with such ceremonies. He walked on the court with his mother. A piano melody played in the background. At halfcourt, he was met by coach Jeff Capel and presented with a framed jersey. The graduate transfer hadn’t yet reached the end of his college career, but he was quickly approaching it.</p>
<p>With that comes a sense of urgency that’s palpable at some times more than others. In the Panthers’ 77-73 loss Saturday at N.C. State, it was evident in a way it hadn’t been in months. Hamilton finished the game with 10 points and 10 rebounds in 20 minutes, giving him his first double-digit rebounding total and first double-double since a victory against Northwestern on Nov. 27. If it wasn’t his best game in his lone season with Pitt, it was one of them.</p>
<p>The game, productive as it was, was just as unexpected.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-9 forward hadn’t scored more than six points or pulled down more than six rebounds in a game since Jan. 4. His grasp on his spot in the Panthers’ rotation was seemingly slipping, too, his role becoming less prominent than it was earlier in the season. Earlier in the week, in that loss to Syracuse, he played just 3:41 of the game’s first 27:30, with 1:04 of that coming with a ceremonial spot in the starting lineup with Anthony Starzynzki and Samson George, two little-used players graduating after this season, who were all subbed out at the first stoppage in play. In the game before that, a loss against Virginia, he played just two minutes.</p>
<p>Against the Wolfpack, Hamilton was, above all else, active. He drew nine fouls, three more than any other player on either of the teams. Though he accounted for five of the team’s 12 missed free throws, he nonetheless got to the line frequently, where he made six of his shots. If there was a loose ball and he was within 10 feet of it, there was a very good chance he was going to end up on the floor fighting for it. Of his 10 rebounds, six of them were on the offensive glass, off of which he got five second-chance points. He showed a solid touch around the basket, as well, like on this screen-and-roll, something which Pitt’s big men have seldom run effectively this season.</p>

<p>Hamilton is a naturally intense person, but that on-court tenacity was ratcheted up following a conversation with assistant coach Jason Capel.</p>
<p>“He was like ‘Just eff it. Just go out there and play hard and just do what you do,’” Hamilton said. “I was playing reserved a lot. I was just in my own bubble and not going that extra mile. I’m at my best whenever I’m high energy.”</p>
<p>Through the team’s first 11 games, it appeared as though Hamilton, while not a major contributor, would be a consistent one, something a thin frontcourt needed mightily. In that time, he was averaging 6.7 points and 4.8 rebounds per game, with five double-figure scoring performances and two double-doubles to his name. His 10 points Saturday marked the first time he had scored at least that many since that early stretch, a time in which his scoring average dipped down to 5.1 points per game.</p>
<p>That slip was caused, in part, by factors largely out of his control. Hamilton said he sprained his knee “really badly” after Pitt’s two wins in Fort Myers, Fla. in November, the second of which was the aforementioned win against Northwestern. In the waning moments of a Feb. 12 loss to Clemson, he had the misfortune of landing on a ball rolling beneath him after he came down from a dunk, injuring his ankle and causing him to miss a game. It’s his final year of college basketball, though, and he wanted to play through pain to make the most of that opportunity.</p>
<p>He doesn’t know exactly how much time is left in his college career, but he’s ready to make the most of whatever is presented to him.</p>
<p>“I’m just trying to get out of my head and just trying to do whatever it takes to help us win,” Hamilton said.</p>
<p><strong>Pitt fell apart late on the road against N.C. State. Again.</strong></p>
<p>With about eight minutes to play Saturday, Pitt was in excellent position to end its five-game losing streak, with a six-point lead in a game it had controlled virtually the entire afternoon. In the time that remained, though, the Panthers were unable to survive a spirited run from the Wolfpack in its home arena, getting outscored by 10 in the final 7:35 and ultimately losing.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time they had traveled to Raleigh only to see victory slip away from it in the game’s final and decisive moments. If anything, it has become the norm for them.</p>
<p>The final 7:40 of each of Pitt’s past three games turned games that were once in its favor quickly against it. It has been equal parts eerie and nightmarish. A quick peek at what transpired in that time:</p>
<p><strong><em>2020</em></strong></p>
<p>First 32:20: Pitt outscored N.C. State, 61-55</p>
<p>Final 7:40: N.C. State outscored Pitt, 22-12</p>
<p><strong><em>2019</em></strong></p>
<p>First 32:20: Pitt outscored N.C. State, 58-55</p>
<p>Final 7:40: N.C. State outscored Pitt, 31-22</p>
<p><strong><em>2017</em></strong></p>
<p>First 32:20: Pitt outscored N.C. State, 69-62</p>
<p>Final 7:40: N.C. State outscored Pitt, 17-5</p>
<p>In the earliest of those matchups&nbsp;— in the seemingly distant universe in which Kevin Stallings was 12-6 as Pitt’s coach&nbsp;— it was the victim of some inopportune offensive ineptitude, making just one of its final 11 shots after making 24 of its first 43.</p>
<p>In the past two matchups, the Panthers were failed primarily by their defense. On Saturday, they allowed 22 points on the final 17 possessions (1.29 points per possession) after giving up 55 points on the first 54 possessions (1.02 points per possession). It was much more drastic the previous season, when they gave up an astonishing 31 points on the final 15 possessions (2.07 points per possession) after allowing 55 points on the first 61 possessions (0.9 points per possession).</p>
<p><strong>It’s time to file a trademark for the phrase ‘Triangle Toney’</strong></p>
<p>In the 1996 film ‘Space Jam,’ there’s a famous scene (at least for people of a certain age) in which the Looney Tunes, trailing their alien tormentors by 48 points at halftime, are given what they think is a magical elixir called ‘Michael’s Secret Stuff,’ that will make them something close to as good as their teammate, NBA legend Michael Jordan. It’s just water, but it served its purpose as a placebo&nbsp;— it extracted an unusually great performance from them.</p>
<p>Au’Diese Toney, as any Pitt fan or human being with a set of functional eyes knows, is not a cartoon character. He’s a sophomore forward for Pitt and a good, improved one, at that. After Saturday’s loss, though, it appears as though he has his own version of ‘Michael’s Secret Stuff’&nbsp;— playing in North Carolina’s Research Triangle.</p>
<p>Though it came in a losing effort against the Wolfpack, Toney had 24 points on nine of 13 shooting. He was a major reason why his team led for his long as it did and why it lost by only four. He scored in a variety of ways&nbsp;— from 3 (where he went two of four), in transition, with tip-ins and with a nifty runner (an aspect of his game that’s not often seen)&nbsp;— with N.C. State largely unable to contain him.</p>

<p>“Just the spacing and picking the right spots, watching the gaps, finishing at the rim and making open shots,” Toney said of his game Saturday.</p>
<p>It’s part of a larger trend. In three games in his career at either N.C. State, Duke or North Carolina (the last of which he has never played at), he has averaged 22.7 points per game, never scoring fewer than 17 points. Additionally, he has shot 64.3% from the field and 70% from 3 in those contests. In all other games in his college career, he averaged 7.8 points per game while shooting 39.4% overall and 24.4% from 3.</p>
<p><strong>Numbers of note</strong></p>
<p><strong>2</strong>: Victories Pitt has against N.C. State in their 20 all-time meetings. That win percentage of 0.1 is its worst against any opponent all-time that it has defeated at least once.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>: Minutes played Saturday by junior guard Ryan Murphy, a season low. In Pitt’s past five games, he has averaged just nine minutes and 3.2 field goal attempts per game. In his first 22 games of the season, he averaged 29.8 minutes and 8.8 shot attempts per game.</p>
<p><strong>39</strong>: Steals Pitt has in its past four games, including 10 Saturday against N.C. State. Five of those 10 steals came from sophomore guard Trey McGowens.</p>
