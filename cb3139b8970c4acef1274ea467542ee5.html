<h1>Spring must be near, as construction season begins for PennDOT</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The calendar may say it’s still winter, but that doesn’t mean it’s too early for PennDOT’s annual rite of spring: orange barrels.</p>
<p>Two major projects will begin Monday, weather permitting, even before the Department of Transportation’s annual news conference to announce regional projects for the construction season.</p>
<p>Traffic restrictions will begin on East Pittsburgh-McKeesport Boulevard in North Versailles so crews can begin bridge preservation work on spans that pass above the boulevard on Route 30. Single-lane and shoulder restrictions will occur from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily through December between&nbsp;Irishtown Road and Navy-Marine Corps Way.</p>
<p>That work is part of a $13.6 million project for Gulisek Construction that also includes milling and resurfacing Route 30 between Lenox Avenue in Forest Hills and Route 48 in North Versailles. Additional traffic restrictions will be announced as the project continues.</p>
<p>Another project that begins Monday involves replacement of a small bridge on Rodi Road in Wilkins.</p>
<p>That bridge is just off Business Route 22, where Rodi provides a connection to Route 130 in Turtle Creek. The project will close the road between Business Route 22 and Penn Center Boulevard, the rear entrance to the apartment and shopping complex.</p>
<p>Clearwater Construction Inc. is the contractor for the $948,000 project. Work should be done by early July.</p>
