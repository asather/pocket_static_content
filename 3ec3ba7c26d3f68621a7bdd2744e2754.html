<h1>Downtown Pittsburgh to reconfigure some streets to expand outdoor dining </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Many Downtown Pittsburgh restaurants will be able to take to the streets under a plan to “reimagine” and expand the outdoor dining experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership on Monday announced the plan to allow restaurants to use some streets, which will be modified with markings, signage and barricades to allow for more seating outdoors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even as restaurants have been allowed to open to customers in the green phase of Gov. Tom Wolf’s statewide reopening plan of the COVID-19 crisis, there are still restrictions limiting restaurants to 50% of their usual occupancy. And many customers still prefer to sit outside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reconfiguration helps businesses to more effectively adhere to occupancy restrictions and safety requirements and best practices to reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>"It’s&nbsp;a wonderful (and safety-conscious) way to get Pittsburgh reactivated,” said Richard Hooper, vice president of marketing and communications for the PDP.</p>
<p>The group is working on the plan with the mayor’s office, the city Department&nbsp;of Mobility and Infrastructure, Pittsburgh Public Safety, Traffic Planning and Design, Port Authority and Parking Authority, and the Michael Baker engineering firm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The actual street configurations are being funded by the Richard King Mellon Foundation and PNC Bank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, “priority locations” will be Sixth Street from Liberty Avenue to Fort Duquesne Boulevard, Strawberry Way between Smithfield and Grant streets, Penn Avenue between Ninth and 10th streets, and Market Square. The PDP said modifications to those streets will affect 72 restaurants and other nearby businesses.</p>
<p>Mr. Hooper explained that modifications vary. For example, Sixth Street between Penn and Liberty avenues will be shifted and lanes shrunken to make more room for outdoor seating along the western curb. Also, Sixth Street between Penn Avenue and Fort Duquesne Boulevard will be one way outbound with the other lane used for outdoor seating and a bike lane.</p>
<p>Penn Avenue between Ninth and 10th streets will have one travel lane.</p>
<p>Market Square and Strawberry Way will be closed to vehicles, but with a lane available for emergencies and off-hours deliveries.</p>
<p>David Priselac, owner of Market Street Grocery and Emerson’s, said, "We&nbsp;know customers&nbsp;feel much more comfortable and enjoy being in outdoor spaces right now, so we’re excited to have the room to&nbsp;make that happen.”</p>
<p>The outdoor spaces are expected to be fully activated by early July and remain open until mid- to late October, and other streets could be modified, too. PDP President and CEO Jeremy Waldrup said in a release,&nbsp;“These inviting spaces will continue to evolve over the next few weeks as we introduce public art and live&nbsp;music.”</p>
<p>Also this week, in another move to support businesses, the PDP is relaunching its Gift Card Give Back program, which gives card buyers and businesses a 25% bonus.</p>
