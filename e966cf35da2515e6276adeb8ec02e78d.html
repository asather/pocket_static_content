<h1>Orthodox Christians observe a quiet Easter </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ever since he was a boy attending the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Oakland, the Rev. Christopher Bender has cherished the dramatic midnight vigil services as Holy Saturday transitioned into Easter.</p>
<p>The priest holds a candle in the darkened cathedral, proclaims the resurrection of Jesus and then shares the light until all the faithful are holding lit candles.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“They light up the whole church,” said Father Bender, who is now the dean, or pastor, of the cathedral. “It’s beautiful.” Parishioners then go outside and, after a gospel reading, process around the church. “We all sing the famous anthem, ‘Christ is Risen from the Dead.’ We sing it in Greek, we sing it in English. Everyone knows the melody.”</p>
<p>The scene is much less dramatic on this unprecedented Easter in the time of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, with churches closed to large congregations.</p>
<p>Father Bender, a chanter and a handful of others have conducted services at the largely empty cathedral through Lent and into Easter.</p>
<p>“I haven’t skipped any services,” he said. “I’ve been doing everything as I normally did.”</p>
<p>Similar changes are being made throughout southwestern Pennsylvania at Orthodox congregations, whose onion-domed churches dot the landscape and carry on the faith tradition of past generations of immigrants. Orthodox Christians worldwide are observing Easter this year a week later than Catholics and Protestants, who use differing formulas for calculating the date of Easter.</p>
<p>For the 10 sisters at the Orthodox Monastery of the Transfiguration in Ellwood City, observing Easter while sheltering in place is not a new concept.&nbsp;They spend most of their time at the convent, and they work from home, too.</p>
<p>But they’re accustomed to having regular visitors, particularly during the just-completed Holy Week, and they often have as many as 50 pilgrims for the Easter vigil, which is followed by a fast-breaking lamb dinner in the early morning hours.</p>
<p>The monastery is now closed to visitors as a precaution to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. While the liturgies have been quieter this year, in one sense they’re drawing more participation than ever. The sisters began to livestream services about seven years ago, typically getting a couple dozen viewers, said Mother Christophora, the abbess.</p>
<p>But “now we have hundreds of people, because they can’t be in their churches,” she said. A Good Friday service drew more than 1,000 views on YouTube. The monastery is affiliated with the Orthodox Church in America.</p>
<p>“Normally we’d have many pilgrims staying in our guest house,” she said. This year, it’s&nbsp;“just us. That’s an unusual experience, although we feel that because so many people are watching our services, we’re extending hospitality in a new way.”</p>
<p>Father Bender, of the Greek Orthodox cathedral, said the current arrangement is a challenge, even with a livestream. He’s looking forward to the resumption of public services.</p>
<p>“We face the altar when we serve the liturgy, but then I turn around to bless the people and there’s nobody’s there,” he said. "The body of Christ isn’t just the priest and the chanter, the body of Christ is the whole people of God,” he said.&nbsp;“When the body’s missing, then the one who remains feels very alone.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Michael Zak pastor of St. Nicholas Orthodox Church in Homestead, said while he’s disappointed the faithful can’t attend services, they have been able to follow livestream services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re in communication with them, but from a distance,” said Father Zak, whose church is affiliated with the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese of the USA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He encourages parishioners to set aside a place in their homes with candles and icons where they can worship.&nbsp;“We like to think their homes are their little churches,” he said.</p>
