<h1>State constable charged with insurance fraud, accused of lying about weapons certification</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pennsylvania constable was charged Friday with fraud after investigators say he misled regulators on insurance applications and falsely stated he was certified to carry firearms.</p>
<p>Richard Salters, 46, of McKees Rocks, is accused of lying on constable insurance liability applications by claiming he was certified to carry a firearm and that he carries a firearm while on duty, according to an investigation conducted by state police Inspector Darrell Parker that was documented in a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Salters allegedly violated state constable policies by checking “yes” in boxes on the forms next to those questions for the years 2019-2020, and 2020-2021.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Salter’s training history under the&nbsp;Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency,&nbsp;he hasn’t been certified to carry a firearm since September 2017, the complaint said.</p>
<p>His certification as a constable is currently set to expire in December, according to the commission's website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police allege Mr. Salter was&nbsp;“well aware of not being able to carry a firearm.” Inspector Parker said in the criminal complaint that a district judge confirmed he spoke with Mr. Salter about his firearm certification&nbsp;“several weeks ago,” and they agreed he would not carry a firearm in the courtroom. The judge also said he has not seen Mr. Salter carry a firearm in court, however.</p>
<p>Police said Mr. Salter also violated state constable policies by saying he carries a firearm on the insurance application. Policy requires constables to have firearm certification to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They're not required to carry firearms, but 90 percent of them do" for safety reasons, said John Pfau, of the bureau of training services for the state commission on crime and delinquency.</p>
<p>Mr. Salter submitted a new application in February and checked&nbsp;“no” beside the firearm certification and possession questions, the complaint said. He also emailed the insurance provider and said he made mistakes on earlier submissions.</p>
<p>Mr. Salter could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>He was charged by summons and faces two misdemeanor counts of insurance fraud, court records show. A preliminary hearing is set for April 14.</p>

They are responsible for providing security to magisterial district courts, transporting prisoners and serving arrest warrants, among other duties. Constables go through 80 hours of training and an additional 40 hours to be certified to carry a firearm.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police officers, on the other hand, complete 11 months of training — about 1,240 hours.</p>
