<h1>City adds another $500K in grant money to go toward blue recycling bins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s city government is a half a million dollars closer to distributing blue recycling bins to residents in an effort to keep blue bags — which are a&nbsp;<a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/recycling/" target="_blank">nuisance at recycling sorting facilities</a> — off the curb.</p>
<p>City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved legislation from the mayor’s office to accept a $500,000 grant from the Falls Church, Va.-based nonprofit Recycling Partnership to purchase the bins and conduct public outreach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The number of bins and when and where they will be distributed is still under review, according to the mayor’s office.</p>
<p>The grant is in addition to the $538,888 in city money and $350,000 in state grant money included in the 2020 capital budget <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/06/26/Pittsburgh-Bill-Peduto-blue-bins-recycling-Pittsburgh-China-glass-plastic-bags/stories/201906260156" target="_blank">for blue bins</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>City residents can sign up at <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/blue-bin-info/index.html" target="_blank">pittsburghpa.gov/blue-bin-info</a> to receive updates on when blue bins will be available.</p>
