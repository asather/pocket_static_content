<h1>COVID-19 precludes honoring three fallen Pittsburgh police officers on 11th anniversary of their deaths</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Police Bureau and the families of three officers killed in an ambush in Stanton Heights 11 years ago Saturday jointly decided the health risks of the COVID-19 pandemic precluded having a ceremony marking the line-of-duty deaths this year.</p>
<p>Instead, the families of&nbsp;fallen Officers Eric Kelly, Stephen Mayhle, and Paul Sciullo.were allowed to privately visit the memorial to the officers in front of the Zone 5 station in Highland Park at 7 a.m.&nbsp;Pittsburgh police officers were invited to visit the memorial as their shifts allowed beginning at 8 a.m. Officers were reminded not to visit in groups and to maintain social distancing.</p>

<p>On that tragic day, Officers Sciullo and Mayhle responded to a 911 call at 1016 Fairfield St. shortly after 7 a.m. The call was for a domestic dispute between then-22-year-old Richard Poplawski and his mother, Margaret. They argued after she discovered that his dog had urinated on the floor.</p>
<p>Heavily armed and wearing body armor, Poplawski killed Officer Sciullo first and then Officer Mayhle. Officer Kelly, who was headed to his Stanton Heights home after his shift, rushed to Fairfield Street when he heard fellow officers were under fire. He was fatally wounded upon arrival.</p>
<p>Officer Timothy McManaway arrived and in the process of pulling Officer Kelly behind a vehicle for cover, was hit on the hand by a bullet or shrapnel. They were eventually rescued by a SWAT team. Officer Kelly died later at UPMC Presbyterian. Another officer, Brian Jones, broke his leg while scaling a fence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Poplawski gave himself up after a four-hour gun battle with police. He was convicted of the murders and remains on death row.</p>
