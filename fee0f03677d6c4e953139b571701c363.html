<h1>UN Report: North Korea thought to be making progress developing nukes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NEW YORK&nbsp; — North Korea appears to be making progress developing nuclear weapons, according to a classified United Nations report, details of which were confirmed to&nbsp;Deutsche Presse-Agentur GmbH on Monday.</p>
<p>North Korea “probably developed miniaturized nuclear devices to fit into the warheads of its ballistic missiles,” diplomatic sources said, citing the report.</p>
<p>The document on compliance with sanctions against North Korea emphasized that the assessments were based on information from a member country.</p>
<p>It asserted that North Korea was continuing its nuclear program, including the production of highly enriched uranium and the construction of an experimental light-water reactor.</p>
<p>That North Korea’s ruler Kim Jong Un is aiming for nuclear weapons is said to be no secret: in a speech in recent days, Kim made it clear that he considers his country’s nuclear arsenal a security guarantee.</p>
<p>“Thanks to our reliable and effective self-defense nuclear deterrence, the word war would no longer exist on this land,” Kim told veterans a week ago to mark the 67th anniversary of the end of the Korean War.</p>
<p>“The security and future of our state will be guaranteed forever,” he added, according to state news agency KCNA.</p>
<p>Tensions on the Korean Peninsula ratcheted up in June following a row over a leafleting campaign by South Korean activists with messages urging North Koreans to overthrow the communist leadership.</p>
