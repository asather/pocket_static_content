<p>The union representing most of the employees at a Beaver County nursing home struggling with t<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/06/Brighton-Rehab-and-Wellness-Beaver-PA-nursing-home-coronavirus-positive-cases/stories/202004060124" target="_blank">he state’s largest outbreak of COVID-19 </a>among residents and staff, said late Tuesday that it has reached an agreement with management to ensure better protection for employees.</p>
<p>“It’s scary to go to work and not know if you’re going to get a life-threatening illness or pass along the virus to one of your residents,” Shania Taylor, a certified nursing assistant who tested positive for COVID-19 last week, said in press release sent out by the union. “We need to keep ourselves, our residents, and our families safe. That includes [personal protective equipment] along with transparency and communication from management. We have to fight this together.”</p>

<p>At least 50 of the 450 residents who are being cared for at the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Brighton have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 12 days, and 11 of those residents have died, according to staff members. At least another 10 staff members have also tested positive.</p>
<p>After a meeting Tuesday between Brighton Rehabilitation’s owners — Comprehensive Healthcare — and members of SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania, the union representing about 300 employees at the nursing home, the owners agreed to have daily meetings with staff “to discuss concerns and develop solutions in a situation that will change day-by-day,” the union said in its press release.</p>
<p>The union said the owners agreed to fit all employees with N95 facemasks, and frontline workers who work directly with residents will receive “hazard pay.” To help those staff members working in direct-care roles — which the building has long been short of — some employees will be reassigned “to ensure adequate staffing,” the union said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/03/31/Brighton-Rehab-and-Wellness-Center-coronavirus-cases-nursing-home-Kane-centers/stories/202003310157" target="_blank">At least two dozen staff members walked off the job</a> over the last two weeks, employees have said, though many of those were temporary workers hired through healthcare employee agencies or temporarily brought to Brighton Rehabilitation from other Comprehensive Healthcare nursing homes in the region. Employees said there have been full-time employees who have left as well, though.</p>
<p>Staff members have complained for over a week that after the building had its first positive COVID-19 case on March 26 that they felt unsafe and scared.</p>
<p>That was, in part, because managers only agreed to provide them with one flimsy, paper-like facemask a week unless they worked directly with a patient who had tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Though the building had the more protective N95 facemasks, they were restricted to employees working directly with patients and managers and even office staff, employees said.</p>
<p>The owners have said rationing N95 facemasks was due to a shortage, something that the state helped rectify last week when a Department of Health employee drove his car to Brighton from Greensburg full of personal protective equipment, including masks.</p>
<p>The union said it would also try to help provide more personal protective equipment to staff, including getting the federal government to help.</p>
<p>Part of the managers’ rationale was that they believed they had contained the COVID-19 cases to one particular unit in the 4th floor east wing, known as 4E.</p>
<p>But last week cases were detected outside of that unit, and on Monday the nursing home declared that I was going to “shift away from counting test results, and presuming all staff and residents may be positive.”</p>
<p>That declaration raised alarm bells in the building and caused confusion not only among staff, but across the state. Such a declaration, which has occurred in other hotspots in the states of Washington and New York, appeared to be the first such move in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine was asked about Brighton Rehabilitation’s declaration during her regular Tuesday online press conference.</p>
<p>Though she declined to address Brighton Rehabilitation’s situation specifically, she said: “If there was a significant outbreak in a facility, or at least one person in a home were positive, other individuals who develop symptoms in that facility or that home could be what are called probable cases.”</p>
<p>She added that there is “no necessity” to test these cases, but if they began to show “significant symptoms,” then they should go to a hospital for treatment and potentially be tested there.</p>
<p>Brighton Rehabilitation’s union said in its press release that the nursing home’s management said residents and staff will continue to be tested for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Monday’s declaration of “presumed positive” was just “a heightened safety measure meant to ensure all precautions are being taken no matter where workers are in the building,” the union said.</p>
<p>The owners had tried to clarify that on Tuesday as well, conceding that Monday’s press release created a “misunderstanding that we desire to clarify.”</p>
<p>“By presuming every staff member and resident may be positive and treating symptoms, not test results, we are doing what we believe every facility and every person in the nation should do,” the owners said, in part, in the press release Tuesday. “We are not saying that every person in our facility, any more than every person on a cruise ship, who went to a certain party, or who lives in New York City, is positive. We believe there is an unidentifiable percentage of people who are inadvertently spreading COVID19 to others because they do not have symptoms and/or tested negative on a test, which may be a false negative, or no longer accurate by the time results are communicated.”</p>
<p>The union said it hoped that the agreement with the owners not only helps protects employees, but demonstrates they are working with the owners to deal with the crisis.</p>
<p>“I feel really good about this agreement and being able to work with management to make sure we are all safe and can stem the spread,” Shelby Dille, a union building representative who has been a nursing assistant for over 40 years and worked at Brighton for the past 14 years, said in the press release. “Having this pandemic sweep through our building and bad things being said about Brighton has hurt us deeply. We have so many loving people here. The residents aren’t just people we take care of, they are family. We will keep doing everything we can to keep them safe and ease their fears.”</p>
