<h1>Pitt-Georgia Tech observations: Jose Alvarado, Gerald Drumgoole and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ATLANTA — On Monday, two days before its game against Pitt, Georgia Tech withdrew its appeal of a postseason ban the NCAA handed the Yellow Jackets for recruiting violations. It was a pragmatic decision for a program that was 15-14 at the time and, with virtually its entire team returning, will harbor valid NCAA tournament aspirations next season.</p>
<p>The current team, however, the one left to deal with the repercussions of that choice, was thrust into a situation with an uncertain outcome. With two games remaining and effectively nothing to play for beyond pride, how would it respond?</p>
<p>Pitt coach Jeff Capel was as interested as anyone in what the answer to that question might be. He had a pretty good idea about the answer, though.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, in that situation, you can have kids that quit,” Capel said. “It’s over with and we can’t go, so what does it matter? But I doubt that will happen with Alvarado. I doubt he would allow that to happen.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Jose Alvarado didn’t. No player was more instrumental in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/03/04/Pitt-clinches-fourth-consecutive-losing-season-loss-Georgia-Tech/stories/202003040178" target="_blank">Georgia Tech’s 73-57 victory</a> Wednesday night against Pitt than the Yellow Jackets’ junior guard. He impacted the game in basically any way he could have, finishing with team highs in points (23), assists (five) and rebounds (nine), the last of which was especially impressive for a player standing only 6 feet tall.</p>
<p>More than anything else, he embodied the fierceness, competitiveness and edge that could have very easily disappeared from Georgia Tech given what transpired earlier in the week.</p>
<p>“To see how our guys responded this week, I cannot give enough accolades or words to them,” Yellow Jackets coach Josh Pastner said.</p>
<p>Alvarado made his presence felt early, even when he wasn’t scoring. In the opening five minutes, he stripped Au’Diese Toney twice on good scoring opportunities near the basket, the first of which came on a two-on-one break. He finished the night with just two steals, but it felt like more. He was a constant pest for Pitt’s guards, an unrelenting source of frustration.</p>
<p>Offensively, he had his way, piloting Georgia Tech’s offense and getting seemingly everything he wanted. There was nothing especially ornate about what the Yellow Jackets did offensively to set up Alvarado. He was simply able to continually beat his defender off the dribble, as he did here against Xavier Johnson and Justin Champagnie on separate occasions, the second of which opened up teammate Moses Wright for a lob and dunk.</p>

<p>Even when Pitt tried to apply more pressure on him and throw multiple defenders at him, Alvarado would either quickly find an open teammate or he’d nimbly split the opposition for a basket.</p>

<p>“He plays with such great energy,” Capel said. “He’s so competitive. I think he really understands how to play the position.”</p>
<p>Capel’s history with and admiration for Alvarado extends well beyond Wednesday night.</p>
<p>After the game, he recalled watching the Brooklyn native playing AAU ball with the New York Rens and being immediately impressed by him. Two years ago, in Capel’s final season as an assistant coach at Duke, Alvarado suffered a gruesome, season-ending elbow injury against the Blue Devils. After the game, Capel reached out to the then-freshman guard and, from there, something of a relationship was born.</p>
<p>There was little about Wednesday’s loss that could have elicited a smile from Capel’s face, particularly in the minutes after the game when he was tasked with reflecting on where everything went so wrong for his team. But as he spoke about Alvarado, a grin very nearly emerged as respect tinged in his voice.</p>
<p>“I love guys that love to compete and that are all about the team,” Capel said. “His competitive spirit and his energy for his team and his program, it’s contagious.”</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Tech’s defense smothered Pitt. On the low post, it was something even more dominant.</strong></p>
<p>While Georgia Tech’s zone befuddled Pitt for much of the game — a look from opposing defenses that typically forces the Panthers into an array of ill-advised shots — the Yellow Jackets’ biggest impact was felt closest to the basket.</p>
<p>They finished the night with 10 blocks, the most for a Pitt opponent this season. At the head of that rim-protecting effort was 6-foot-10 senior James Banks III, who finished with four blocks. Two other Georgia Tech players, the 6-foot-9 Wright and 6-foot-10 Evan Cole, had two blocks apiece. It wasn’t an especially surprising development for a squad that ranks among the top 50 Division I teams in block percentage, with Banks ranking 49th among all Division I players in that category individually.</p>
<p>Though not revelatory, the impact of those blocks and that interior defense was undeniable. Even when the Yellow Jackets didn’t record a block, their length and pressure regularly altered the Panthers’ shots.</p>

<p>Pitt missed 16 of its 23 layup attempts and both of its dunks after going 10 of 16 on such shots in the first meeting between the teams last month, a 73-64 victory for the Panthers. It had an effect on Champagnie, who went just two of five on layups and dunks after making six of seven such shots in his 30-point outburst in the first matchup.</p>
<p>With a 7-foot-5 wingspan, Banks was lethally effective in limiting the Panthers down low, even blocking or altering multiple shots in a single possession.</p>

<p>“It’s not like that he’s just big and long and athletic. He has energy,” Capel said. “He’s a completely different guy than he was when he was at Texas. That shows the development and all the stuff here. When you have a guy that can protect the basket, that gives your perimeter guys a little more confidence to take some chances. You can kind of funnel guys there because you know you have a guy that can protect the basket like that.”</p>
<p><strong>If there was a silver lining in Pitt’s loss, it was Gerald Drumgoole</strong></p>
<p>Little about Gerald Drumgoole’s freshman season has gone as planned.</p>
<p>The former top-150 recruit started in the Panthers’ first game of the season, a 63-61 victory against what is now a top-10 Florida State team, but an ankle injury later that month sidelined him for six weeks. He has struggled to reacclimate since coming back from that, often getting no more than a handful of minutes in a game and has encountered difficulty in that time, missing 18 of his 22 shots in the 14 games since he came back.</p>
<p>On a night in which little, if anything, went right for his team, Drumgoole provided a bright spot, albeit a small one. In 17 minutes, only the fourth time in the past 11 games he has logged more than seven minutes, the 6-foot-5 wing had a career-high six points and four rebounds, going two of four from the field and one of two from 3-point range.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Drumgoole has looked increasingly comfortable within a game. On Wednesday, it resulted in the best performance of his college career.</p>
<p><strong>Numbers of note</strong></p>
<p><strong>8-36</strong>: The record of Capel’s past four teams — two at Pitt and two at Oklahoma — in games in February and March.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>: Made 3s from Ryan Murphy in the loss. It marked the first time since a Jan. 25 loss at Syracuse that he had made multiple 3s in a game, though he missed three contests in that time while recovering from a concussion. He is 3-of-7 from 3 in Pitt’s past three games after going zero of seven in its previous five matchups.</p>
<p><strong>73</strong>: Days Eric Hamilton had gone without a double-digit scoring performance. The Pitt graduate transfer forward now has two in a five-day span after scoring 12 and 10 points in losses to Georgia Tech and N.C. State, respectively.</p>
