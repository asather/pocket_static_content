<h1>COVID-19 puts strain on athletic departments' academic support staff</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For Mike Farabaugh, Sherene Brantley and countless people who work in college athletics, there’s no such thing as a normal day.</p>
<p>Even for those away from the courts and fields of play — such as Farabaugh and Brantley, who work in academic support in the athletic departments at Pitt and Duquesne, respectively — the monotony of a traditional 9-to-5 job is not offered. It’s partially why many of them got into the field in the first place.</p>
<p>Still, the past several weeks have provided more unpredictability than anyone could have imagined. The coronavirus pandemic has canceled all sporting events and forced schools to abandon in-person instruction, fundamentally altering the way everyone in college athletics goes about their jobs and their lives.</p>
<p>As final exams continue or await, that fact has been especially apparent to Farabaugh, Brantley and thousands of others who work on the academic side in an athletic department. With athletes strewn across the country and even the globe, Farabaugh, Brantley and their staffs have had to prepare those students for the most consequential week on the academic calendar in unfamiliar ways, depriving them of the intimacy to which they’re accustomed.</p>
<p>At the intersection of higher education and athletics, COVID-19 has created, as Brantley said, a “VUCA environment” — one of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.</p>
<p>“We always have to be agile in those pieces,” Brantley said. “For us, this is just one more piece that is competing against what we do. Student-athletes every day, they have competing interests when we’re trying to work with them, whether it’s sports or family. ... We’re always having something to compete against. COVID is just one more thing we’re competing against.”</p>
<p>“We try to make everything seem as normal as possible for them in what I would call an abnormal time,” Farabaugh said.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, “normal” has taken on an evolving meaning. The methods and framework academic support staffs have used comfortably for years were, in an instant, no longer available to them.</p>
<p>Study halls and tutoring sessions that were once done in person are still done face to face, but with those faces gazing at each other on a screen via Zoom, Skype or FaceTime. For international students, there are services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Those meetings can be scheduled or they can simply be opportunities to check on athletes, see how they’re doing, find out what, if anything, they may need and remind them of upcoming assignments.</p>
<p>At Pitt, Farabaugh said about 25 members of tutoring staff, who are students at the university, have been able to continue with their work. At Robert Morris, Nicole Law, the school’s assistant athletic director for academics, has made herself available from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. every day to assist athletes with registration.</p>
<p>“It’s putting some structure into what you would think would not have a lot of structure,” Farabaugh said. “We’re trying to provide that to them remotely.”</p>
<p>Athletes are accustomed to structure and rigid time management more than the average college student. For years, they’ve had to balance practices and workouts with classes and study sessions.</p>
<p>In a world in which they’re not physically connected to those routines, they’ve handled the adjustment reasonably well. They have the fortune of being products of a more tech-savvy generation, making digital instruction less jarring than it may have been otherwise. To Brantley, it reflects how it would be on campus — the majority of athletes have handled the change well while others who they have to pay closer attention to still require that extra oversight. Law added that most athletes have lamented the loss of in-person interaction.</p>
<p>“There are students who are just not built for an online platform and their challenges are not just based on the course but specific academic skills (i.e. time management, procrastination, study habits),” Law wrote in an email.</p>
<p>The current set-up has predictably presented challenges. Some of those are logistical. The wide array of time zones in which athletes now live has posed some problems or, at the very least, forced some lifestyle changes. Between the three Pittsburgh-area&nbsp;Division I schools, athletes are now situated in places as distant as Athens, Greece (seven hours ahead), Kapolei, Hawaii (six hours behind) and Sydney, Australia (14 hours ahead).</p>
<p>If nothing else, the current reality deprives these athletic departments of a measure of control and a certain peace of mind.</p>
<p>“You’re dealing with internet accessibility. You’re dealing with siblings,” Farabaugh said.</p>
<p>“You don’t know everybody’s home situation, so you try and help them navigate it. That’s probably the biggest challenge for students — making sure they have good learning environments and an environment that’s really productive for them for how to approach the different classes they’re in.”</p>
<p>Some of those anxieties are linked to the athletes themselves, some of whom Brantley said have avoidance behaviors. Separated by hundreds of miles, academic support staff members are no longer able to drop in on a practice or find an athlete outside one of their classes.</p>
<p>There are subtler hurdles, as well. Though they can still see athletes on a video chat, some of the physical tells tutors and others on the academic side have spent years learning — a foot tap, a hand motion—- are no longer visible in the same way, the very same things that let that person know the athlete isn’t doing as well academically or in their personal life as they may say they are.</p>
<p>“I can’t observe when I need to sort of have more influence or have more input,” Brantley said. “That’s what we’re missing. Everyone’s not going to tell you that they need help, but we can’t see that.”</p>
<p>For that reason and others, Farabaugh, Brantley and Law have a hard time envisioning this becoming a common practice in their line of work. The technology may be there to make such sessions possible, and some athletes do already take an online course or two, but as Farabaugh noted “there’s no substitute for faculty-student interaction on a college campus.”</p>
<p>Accustomed as those in academic services are to unconventional schedules, the past several weeks have required an acclimation. The things that guide them in their profession, however, remain the same.</p>
<p>“How we do the work, a little bit may change,” Brantley said. “But the reason why we do it never changes.”</p>
