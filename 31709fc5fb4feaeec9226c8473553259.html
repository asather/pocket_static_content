<h1>MLB won't counter players' 70-game proposal, as talks near end</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>So much for any sort of positivity or goodwill that a face-to-face meeting between baseball’s biggest villains might’ve created.</p>
<p>It was a fun couple of days, though, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>After a short stretch earlier this week where baseball had hope, with MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and union head Tony Clark mending their differences and seemingly able to agree on a path to play in 2020, the sport has once again back-slid into ridiculousness.</p>
<p>On Friday, the league informed the MLB Players Association that it would not accept the union’s recent proposal for 70 games. Furthermore, MLB would not be making any sort of counterproposal.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">This means a couple things.</span></p>
<p>One, according to Jon Heyman of MLB Network, players are expected to vote soon on the league’s most recent proposal, which was for 60 games at full prorated salaries. That came after a meeting between Manfred and Clark in Arizona.</p>
<p>If the players accept, spring training 2.0 will start roughly a week later. If they don’t, it will be up to Manfred to implement a season, the length of which he’s allowed to choose so long as players get full prorated salaries.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The expectation there is for around 50 games.</span></p>
<p>However, if a 2020 season comes via mandate and not an agreement, the players union would retain its right to file a grievance, with that group likely alleging the league did not try to play as many games as possible.</p>
<p>Starting the season without an agreement would also eliminate the possibility of expanded playoffs, keeping the field at 10 teams — not 16.</p>
<p>This is one reason why it was strange to see the league decline the opportunity to make what would be an eighth (total) proposal: There’s a lot of money potentially lost there.</p>
<p>What this could symbolize, though, is this: The MLBPA may have overplayed its hand.</p>
<p>After backing away from the bargaining table last weekend, Clark issued a statement concluding with the phrase “when and where.” Players tweeted about it. The three words seemed to catch on. The players, it seemed, were done with this charade.</p>
<p>But after the owners did say when and where — and for how much — the players went back on their word and returned to the bargaining table, trying to get more games.</p>
<p>Friday’s news also comes at an interesting time, as the Phillies and Blue Jays have had positive tests for the novel coronavirus at their spring training facilities; the Phillies had eight, the Blue Jays one. Both places are closed.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Meanwhile, the Giants shuttered their spring training facility in Arizona after a visitor tested positive for COVID-19, and the Mets are thinking about holding spring training 2.0 in New York rather than Florida.</span></p>
<p>How that plays here is this: The delay doesn’t hurt. It buys time. And, with the way things are going virus-wise, it may make sense for baseball to target a shorter season anyway.</p>
<p>After the news broke, the MLBPA issued a statement saying it would “convene in the near future to determine next steps” and that “players remain committed to getting back to work as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>But with the way this entire thing has gone, as contentious and unproductive as talks have been, it makes you wonder if either side is truly interested in playing baseball this season.</p>
<p>Especially when you consider that it likely would’ve cost each team $4 million in additional salaries to reach what would’ve been a logical midpoint of 65 games. A pittance for an industry that made $10.7 billion last year.</p>
<p>The only good news is that this painstaking process seems to be finally nearing its end.</p>
