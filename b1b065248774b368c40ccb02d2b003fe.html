<h1>BLM, social justice demonstrations continue around the Pittsburgh region </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Demonstrations continued around the Pittsburgh region Sunday as participants called for action on social justice agendas including police reforms and support for the Black Lives Matter movement, sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>A car and bike caravan organized to speak out against state violence, racism and poverty started in the Hill District and then headed Downtown to circle the Allegheny County Courthouse.</p>
<p>The event was organized by the Pennsylvania Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival coincided with four other such protest caravans in cities across the state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, a few hundred people held a solidarity march in Murrysville to show their support for the Black Lives Matter movement and racial justice, as the nation continues to rally against racism in the wake of the death of George Floyd, who died while in the custody of Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>The protesters met at Tarr Hollow Road and marched down Old William Penn Highway, past Franklin Regional Middle School.</p>
<p>Aryanna Hunter, the event’s organizer and a U.S. Army veteran, said she was surprised by the turnout.</p>
<p>“I am humbled that you are here supporting those of us whose voices have been weakened and oppressed over time.”</p>
<p>Cyclists rolled through the streets of Oakland in a demonstration that started in Mellon Park and moved past Schenley Park, with protesters chanting George Floyd’s name and calling for an end to police brutality and racial injustice while they rode, according to PG news partner KDKA-TV.</p>
<p>Jordan Rose, a local fitness trainer, and cyclist himself organized this protest.</p>
<p>“Pittsburgh is a bike city. And I’ve been praying to God and he said I gave you two wheels so get on those wheels and spread the word,” Rose told KDKA.</p>
