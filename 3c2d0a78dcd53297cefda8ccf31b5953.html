<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Chad:&nbsp;</strong>Do you think the NFL will start keeping all players in the locker room for the national anthem for fears of backlash from renewed player protests, or do you believe they will just continue not showing when the anthem is played on TV?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> No, I think the NFL will spend the next two months consulting with image and branding experts to figure out the best way to handle it. And they will come up with the great idea to encourage every player and coach to kneel during the anthem or some similar way of making a corporate statement. This is how it works — protect the shield and when something threatens it, figure out a way to make it work and offend the least amount of people. Now, what I would do is this: Stop playing the anthem and stop all these needless displays of what I would call pseudo-patriotism at NFL games. It is nice to honor troops and those who have served, but why do we have to incorporate it into seemingly every break of every game? There is no reason for it other than pandering. It is nice to have some displays and honor special soldiers here and there, but it has been overkill. I just don’t understand it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Larry:</strong> With respect to your comments about Drew Brees — do you and John Steigerwald even remember why Kaepernick chose to kneel during the anthem? You are both outraged over disrespecting the flag, but not outraged regarding the brutal and inhuman treatment of fellow citizens for whom it supposedly represents?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Good lord. Where do I start with this mess? I am not nor have I ever been&nbsp;“outraged” (one of the most overused and as a result meaningless words in the dictionary these days) about Colin Kaepernick — or anyone else — kneeling. In fact, I wrote many times that he has the right to kneel and he has the right to offer his opinion. I do think his credibility was hurt when he wore a Fidel Castro shirt and made some idiotic comments about how Castro wasn’t all bad, but nevertheless, I have no issues with him kneeling. My issue is that people don’t seem to want to give Drew Brees and others like him the same level of understanding as we are all supposed to give Kaepernick. He was raised to stand for the anthem out of respect. And so in his eyes, those who don’t stand aren’t showing respect. He made it clear he supports Kaepernick’s cause; he just doesn’t think kneeling is the right way to go about it. I’m not sure why that stance has sparked such outrage.</p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong>&nbsp;It sounds like you're missing the point of the criticism of Drew Brees. The reason other players and some media reacted so strongly is that Brees’ comments showed that he had bought into the narrative that the protests were about disrespecting the flag and the military, as opposed to what they really were about, which was using the platform to call attention to the continued senseless violence against young black men by police officers across the country. You understand there is a difference, right? Drew Brees believed people were disrespecting the flag, but that’s not what they were doing.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> And you, too, miss the point. Drew Brees didn’t say he doesn’t support the causes Kaepernick was kneeling for. In fact, he said the opposite of that. All he said was he will never support disrespecting the flag and in HIS mind, based on how HE was raised, not standing for the national anthem is disrespectful. Again, I am not sure why people were so angry at him. He didn’t say he doesn’t support Kaepernick’s cause or views on injustice, he just said he doesn’t like his method.</p>
<p>W<strong>illiam:&nbsp;</strong>Your comment in response to the fan asking about the Drew Brees situation -- that “he was shamed into apologizing is absurd” -- I believe is off base. I am a Vietnam-era veteran and never took exception to Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem.&nbsp;Frankly, displaying the flag like the practice of using a gigantic flag to cover a ballfield is, in fact, a disrespectful use of the flag. Or using the flag on T-shirts, etc. There are very limited ways to respectfully display the flag. We violate those rules every day. Why are you so bothered by Colin Kaepernick when many military members support him?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I can see the pitchfork crowd is out to get me because I have the audacity to step back and not react to what I think I am hearing, but rather what is actually said. I will try this again — I am not bothered by Kaepernick. Not even a little. I am not bothered that he and others kneel during the national anthem. I support their right to say and do what they want. I think what they are fighting for and trying to bring awareness to is important. My objection is that Drew Brees has not been afforded that same respect. We keep saying&nbsp;“let’s have a conversation” about race. OK, let’s have a conversation — as in a two-way discussion where both sides listen and understand where the other is coming from. If Brees had said&nbsp;“I don’t support Kaepernick’s cause,” it would be a much different conversation. He didn’t. He just said, “I think it is disrespectful to take a knee during the anthem,” and millions of people agree with him. I am not saying he is right or wrong on his stance, I am saying I completely understand where he is coming from. If you are raised to believe something is respectful, when people do the opposite of it, you see it as disrespect.</p>
<p><strong>Greg:</strong> Paul, what are your thoughts about Colin Kaepernick now? Do you still think the Steelers shouldn’t sign him?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Good lord. My thoughts on Kaepernick are the same as they have always been. He is a marginal quarterback who decided to take a stance that wasn’t well-received. If he was a star quarterback, he wouldn’t have lost his job. But when you are an average player and step out on a limb, well, you become expendable. And no, the Steelers shouldn’t sign him. They have passed on the opportunities to sign better backup quarterbacks than him.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Do you believe that Pat Narduzzi actually didn’t know or realize&nbsp;“thug” has racial overtones to it? I find it hard to believe he could have worked in college football as long as he has and had never been confronted about it before. Doesn’t this just sound like a typical coach trying to cover his own ass?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I don’t know what is in a man’s heart, and I am an optimist who meets people where they are. I do believe he is being genuine and I believe he is genuine in his concern for his players. All I can go by is this: He always treated my son Elijah with great respect. Elijah respects him, loves him and said most of his teammates did, too. You have 105 players, and there are bound to be a few who don’t like you or don’t respond well to your form of coaching. I also asked Elijah about the&nbsp;“thugs” stuff and he said that Narduzzi does use that word but he doesn’t believe for one second there was anything racial meant by it, just that Narduzzi was a little bit old school. He said Narduzzi treated all players of all colors, shapes and sizes the same. That’s all I can go by, and so to answer the question, yes, I think he is being genuine.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Art:</strong> If Johnny Majors had stayed at Pitt from 1976 until he retired in 1996, how much different would the program have been and how much different would it be today?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Wow, that’s a great question. I definitely think they would have won another national title in either 1980 or ’81, maybe even both years. The program would have been a lot better, no doubt, but in the ‘80s it would have started to fall apart regardless. The administration was not helpful to football and did a lot to sabotage the program back then. Also, the lack of facilities would have caught up to Majors. I don’t think he would have been able to maintain anything close to what the program was from 1975-1983.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:&nbsp;</strong>Setting aside whether he will stay healthy at his age (and salary cap number), my real problem with the Ben offense (and it's clearly Ben's offense) is that even in the best of stat years, when is the last time you can remember this offense, with a chance to close a game out in a four-minute situation, actually being able to string together the 3 to 4 first downs, instead of having to punt the ball and, for better or worse, put the game in the hands of the defense to close it out?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Wow, that’s one of the longest questions ever. I think Roethlisberger will be asked to do less this year and that will be great for the Steelers. It really depends on how well the offensive line and run game come along. If the run game doesn’t develop, then it will be on Ben’s shoulders completely and I don’t think that is going to be a winning strategy.</p>
