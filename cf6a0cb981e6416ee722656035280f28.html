<h1>Oscar Marin on the state of Pirates pitching: Part I, starters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Oscar Marin inherited a mess.</p>
<p>The Pirates in 2019 pitched to a 5.18 ERA, the third-worst such mark in the modern history of the franchise. Worse, they were behind the times in several areas.</p>
<p>As baseball shifted more toward spin pitches, the Pirates led MLB in percentage of fastballs thrown (59.3%). They also lacked when it came to pitcher preparedness, specifically with how little they were able to leverage technology.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of a shortened season is hardly enough to fix everything, but Marin, the Pirates’ first-year pitching coach, has seen meaningful progress. He met with the media Saturday and talked about some of that.</p>
<p>What follows — along with another piece Sunday — touches on a variety of topics involving the Pirates pitching staff, starting with, well, the starters.</p>
<p><strong>‘The best thing’</strong></p>
<p>This season was supposed to be pivotal for Mitch Keller, the Pirates’ 24-year-old future front-line starter. To this point, it’s been more frustrating than anything. Keller has made two starts, exiting the second one with a left oblique injury.</p>
<p>Keller showed promise in his season debut, allowing one run over five innings July 26 at St. Louis. He lacked strikeout stuff but pitched his way to outs.</p>
<p>“We challenged him to change speeds and eye levels,” Marin said. “He was able to do those things, and we were really happy with his progress.”</p>
<p>Since the injury, Keller has been spending a lot of time with Jameson Taillon, further delving into the nuance of pitching, analyzing scouting reports, reviewing what the big club is doing and going through situations verbally instead of physically.</p>
<p>“[Keller] being in the rehab process with Taillon has probably been the best thing for him,” Marin said.</p>
<p>Marin said the Pirates have worked with Keller on maintaining body position through his delivery, something that may have caused his injury, which may have been a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p><strong>Loving life</strong></p>
<p>Another interesting storyline involving the rotation centers around Chad Kuhl, who’s coming off Tommy John surgery. Kuhl, who will start Sunday against the Reds, has been the poster boy for the Pirates’ pitch-mix changes.</p>
<p>(The Pirates are now throwing fastballs a franchise-low 49.1% of the time.)</p>
<p>Before his injury, Kuhl threw 32.9% breaking balls. Now, he’s at 53.4%, while his four-seamer usage has shrunk from 22.2% to 1.5%. A hard sinker that averages 94.2 mph complements the spin stuff, but Kuhl still only throws it 40.4% of the time.</p>
<p>While Kuhl’s strikeouts per nine (7.14) are a shade below his career mark (7.87), his batting average against has gone from .265 in 2018 to .212 this season. His WHIP is a career-low 1.21.</p>
<p>“He loves the way he’s pitching right now,” Marin said.</p>
<p>The Pirates have also worked with Kuhl on his delivery. Marin said a focal point has been preventing Kuhl from “drifting” too much toward home plate. This is important because it can cause unwanted stress on the arm, as it lags behind the body.</p>
<p><strong>Trust your stuff</strong></p>
<p>Pirates pitchers had a 4.88 ERA entering Saturday’s game, an improvement but still the 11th-worst such mark in the modern era history of the franchise. A big reason for that has been the free passes; looking at walks per nine, only the 2000 Pirates (4.42) were worse than this year’s bunch (4.41).</p>
<p>The bases on balls have occurred, Marin explained, because the Pirates have not been good enough trying to get outs in the strike zone. They’ve nibbled, perhaps not completely confident in their abilities.</p>
<p>“Our guys have good stuff,” Marin said. “If we fall behind in counts, numbers tell us that even if you have really good stuff, that becomes average.”</p>
<p>JT Brubaker has been an example of that. Brubaker is similar to Kuhl in that he has two excellent breaking balls to go along with a hard sinker and a changeup. He also has a strikeout rate of 24.3% that’s above the MLB average (21.7%).</p>
<p>But Marin wants Brubaker — and all Pirates pitchers — to do something that’s a little between pitching solely for strikeouts and pitching to contact: to live in the strike zone and be unafraid of challenging hitters. That part has been a work in progress.</p>
<p>“Understanding his stuff plays in the zone is really going to make him take that next step,” Marin said of Brubaker.</p>
<p><strong>‘That’s baseball’</strong></p>
<p>It’s been an odd year for Trevor Williams. Going into Saturday’s start, he had a barrel rate of just 3.7%, which was by far the best of his career. In fact, among pitchers with at least 100 plate appearances against, only four have been better.</p>
<p>Williams had also been allowing hard contact (30.8%) at a rate below his career average (31.7%), yet his ERA sat at an abysmal 5.50, up from last year and the worst since his first MLB season (2016).</p>
<p>What’s up?</p>
<p>“That’s baseball,” Marin said. “You’re going to have that, especially as a pitcher. We saw it [Friday] with [Steven] Brault — not a lot of hard-hit balls, but they found holes.”</p>
<p>Though he declined to reveal them, Marin said the Pirates had identified a few areas of improvement for Williams.</p>
<p>“Can you alter things? Absolutely. Is it as easy as just saying it? Not always,” Marin said. “But we’re going to try to do some of that [Saturday].”</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Orioles claimed Carson Fulmer, who was designated for assignment on Wednesday.</p>
