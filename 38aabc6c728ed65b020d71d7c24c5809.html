<h1>Missing your Thursday happy hour? Raise your glasses #AloneTogether with the Pittsburgh Fine Drinking Society</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For going on nearly nine years and roughly 400+ Thursdays members of the Pittsburgh Fine Drinking Society have gathered at hundreds bars in the city limits, from hot new restaurants, to smoky dives, chic clubs, swanky cocktail lounges, speakeasies, breweries, gay and sports bars alike to kick back and toss back a tipple or two.</p>
<p>And their president Lou Kroeck won’t let pandemic panic stop them this week: they’re taking their weekly happy hour online.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="blank"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“Everyone is stressed as hell right now so we thought how can we be together without being around each other?” Mr. Kroeck, an attorney from the South Side said. “We want to stay positive despite this terrible thing.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kroeck, is inviting group members — and strangers — to a Google hangout at 5 p.m. where they will socialize, mingle, play games and of course drink, COVID-19 be damned. They’ll simply be doing it from the comfort of their home, via their laptops or smartphones, with whatever beverages they may have on hand.</p>
<p>“We’re still kind of working out for the details. We’re just trying it this week for the first time. The Google Hangout will support up to 50 people. The ten people that are participating the most will be displayed. But if people want to break off and have their own separate conversation, they can do that too — the same as if you move to a different part of the bar.”</p>
<p>A week ago, the group convened at the Harp &amp; Fiddle in the Strip District for their annual St. Patrick’s celebration; tomorrow they were supposed to gather at the Sharp Edge, Downtown. When that clearly was not going to happen, he said one of the group's regulars called him and asked “What are we gonna do?”</p>
<p>Mr. Kroeck first read about people in Japan using a teleconferencing app called Zoom to drink with strangers.</p>
<p>“Zoom looks like the best technology to do this,” he said, adding that it was quicker and easier to get it off the ground with Google Hangouts. He’d like it to catch on so that it can be a regular event.</p>
<p>“Oh, absolutely. Until this thing is over,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re actually looking for someone to bartend. We want a bartender who's off of work to participate as an emcee, and we can tip them through Paypal or Venmo to make up for lost wages,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re looking for a nice queue of bartenders, and we can throw them some cash. It sucks so many places might not open again, and the service industry folks need to figure out how pay their rent,” Mr. Kroeck said. “So how can we support them, be social and have some fun?”</p>
<p>What exactly would an online bartender do?</p>
<p>“Maybe introduce people, ask everyone what they’re drinking, give suggestions on how to make drinks at home, stuff like that,” he said, adding that they’re looking for deejays as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Kroeck formed the group as an offshoot of his prolific and entertaining blog, pittsburghhappyhour.com, in which he reviews local watering holes. A half dozen people convened at the former Easy Street in Oxford Centre, Downtown, in June 2011 for the first happy hour event, and Mr. Kroeck knew only two of them.</p>
<p>He estimates that since, hundreds of different people have attended events, and the group has over 1,800 followers on Facebook and almost as many on Twitter. New faces appear regularly, and the group cuts a wide demographic swath with respect to age, race, gender, sexual orientation and socioeconomic status. They occasionally take a week off if a major holiday falls on a Thursday, but otherwise they get together religiously. And still will — sort of.</p>
<p>Mr. Kroeck said that although a single Google Hangout is limited to 50 participants, if there is a demand that “doesn't mean we couldn't create multiple hangouts.”</p>
<p>And what will he be drinking?</p>
<p>“Whiskey,” he said. “I gave beer up for Lent.”</p>
