<h1>Poison center seeing increase in exposure to cleaning and sanitizing products in Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hand sanitizer and rubbing alcohol continue to fly off store shelves due to concerns over the spread of COVID-19, and Pittsburgh — like the rest of the U.S. — is seeing an uptick in unwarranted exposure to those and other products.</p>
<p>From March 1 to April 13, the Pittsburgh Poison Center noted a 63% overall increase in hand sanitizer-related calls than during the same span in 2019. Seventy-five percent of those calls involved children 12 and under, according to Dr. Michael Lynch, the center’s medical director.</p>
<p>“What we see most often is children and adults either accidentally or intentionally drinking these products,” Dr. Lynch said. “But exposure to eyes is somewhat common [among these calls] as well.”</p>
<p>Death from drinking hand sanitizer is rare because it is not particularly toxic. Most cases of exposure are relatively mild.</p>
<p>Yet because most are ethanol based, Dr. Lynch said the poison center is most concerned about their high-alcohol content.</p>
<p>“The primary toxin we’re worried about in these cases is alcohol, especially around children,” he said. “It can cause burning, stomach irritation and even intoxication, which carries risk of further injury.”</p>
<p>The poison center does not recommend inducing vomiting for a person that has ingested hand sanitizer, Dr. Lynch said,&nbsp;noting that would be the instinctual response for some people.</p>
<p>Instead, he recommends drinking water or milk and eating foods like bread, which can help settle the stomach and lessen the effects of intoxication.</p>
<p>Toxic exposure to rubbing alcohol has seen an even more dramatic increase, especially since liquor stores closed statewide in March, Dr. Lynch said.</p>
<p>Calls to the poison center increased by 146% between March 18 and April 14, it said, compared to the same time in 2019.</p>
<p>The high alcohol content in rubbing alcohol can be an attractive alternative to alcoholics, especially those showing withdrawal symptoms, the poison center warned.</p>
<p>Unlike ethanol-based hand sanitizers, most rubbing alcohols are isopropyl based, which can cause severe stomach irritation, bleeding in the stomach lining or even pancreatitis if ingested in high enough amounts, Dr. Lynch said.</p>
<p>“The majority of cases of rubbing alcohol exposure we see are actually from adults,” Dr. Lynch said. “There has been a 68% increase of rubbing alcohol exposure nationwide over the past month, so the lack of access to [drinking] alcohol may be the reason why the rate is so much higher in Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>Although much less common, the Pittsburgh Poison Center also has seen some cases of adults exposed to far more toxic substances, such as antifreeze or windshield-washer fluid.</p>
<p>Despite a short spike of cases in March, Dr. Lynch said there has actually been an overall decrease in the number of these more toxic exposures since 2019. That may be the result of people driving less, he said.</p>
<p>Ingesting antifreeze or windshield-washer fluid can be fatal. It can also cause acute kidney damage or failure, abnormal heart rhythms and a buildup of acid in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Methanol, the type of alcohol used in windshield-washer fluid, can also cause prolonged or permanent blindness.</p>
<p>“The overall amount of cases of exposure to these types of cleaning products is still relatively low, but we have seen an increase recently, so it is something that we are concerned about and are on the lookout for,” Dr. Lynch said.</p>
