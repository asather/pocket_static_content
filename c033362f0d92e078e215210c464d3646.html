<h1>Fishing Report: Summer sun kept many anglers off the water, Erie walleye remained spotty.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Lake Erie</strong> (Erie County) With air in the 90s and the water surface reaching 80 degrees, many anglers stayed off the lake. Walleye were still spotty with a lot of throwaways. Best waters continued to be west of Walnut Creek. The bigger ’eyes were taken using riggers, boards or Dipsies at 50-60 feet. Purple was hot, and bottom dragging was effective. East of the peninsula, early morning smallmouth bass took soft plastics.</p>
<p><strong>Pymatuning Reservoir</strong> (Crawford County) A few anglers sweated it out on the water, rigging shad lures and crawler harnesses to planer boards to catch walleye. Some muskies were taken, and channel catfish continued to be caught throughout the lake.</p>
<p><strong>Justus Lake</strong> (Venango County) Trout took worms in cool 30-foot depths. Big largemouths were also taken in deep water.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Venango, Franklin counties) Smallmouths took soft plastics from dawn to about 10 a.m. Despite previous COVID-related cancellations, Western PA Team Bass series tournaments were rescheduled to resume Aug. 1. Details at 814-657-4588 or <a href="https://www.wptbs.net/" target="_blank">wptbs.net</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Shenango Reservoir</strong> (Mercer County) Good-sized panfish were in deep, cool water on this Panfish Enhancement program lake. Crappies must be 9 inches to harvest and the creel limit is 20.</p>
<p><strong>Raccoon Lake</strong> (Beaver County) Crappies and bluegills went for worms under bobbers in shady waters near the boat launch.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio River</strong> (Beaver County) Two flatheads in the 35-inch range were taken on cut bait bait at night.</p>
<p><strong>North Park Lake</strong> (Allegheny County) An 18-inch golden rainbow was caught on live bait and released. Boating anglers fished in the aerated area below the upper dam.</p>
<p><strong>Twin Lakes</strong> (Westmoreland County) Sisters Jessica and Theresa Lightner of Greensburg caught several medium-size bass on paste baits near the Lower Lake marina Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Off Cape Cod</strong> (Massachusetts) Paul Vancheri, who grew up in the Perrysville section of Ross and now lives in Boston, was among several friends who reeled in a 7-foot tuna estimated to weigh 450 pounds. It took four men to wrangle the fish into the boat.</p>
<p><em>Fishing Report will return Aug. 14.</em></p>
