<p>Soup hits the spot when it’s cold outside, and it’s kind to the cook because you can throw it together with whatever you have in your fridge or pantry. This one features cannellini beans — a creamy, nutty variety often used in Italian dishes — along with crumbled Italian sausage and a big handful of healthful greens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used a mix of Tuscan and curly kale, but you could substitute spinach, collards or&nbsp;Swiss chard. Harissa, a hot chili pepper paste, adds a beautiful reddish orange hue, but it’s spicy so you may want to taste as you go.</p>
<p>For an even heartier meal, top this soup with a fried egg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 large bunch kale, thick stems separated from the leaves</p>
<p>¼ cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling</p>
<p>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</p>
<p>1 medium red or yellow onion, thinly sliced</p>
<p>Kosher salt and black pepper</p>
<p>1 pound Italian sausage, removed from casings</p>
<p>2-3 tablespoons harissa or tomato paste</p>
<p>Red pepper flakes (optional)</p>
<p>3 (15-ounce) cans large white beans such as cannellini, butter or great Northern, drained and rinsed</p>
<p>4 cups vegetable or chicken broth, or more to taste</p>
<p>1 lemon, halved, for squeezing</p>
<p>2 ounces feta or other salty cheese such as pecorino, crumbled</p>
<p>1 cup parsley or cilantro leaves and tender stems</p>
<p>Tear kale leaves into bite-size pieces and set aside. Chop stems into about ¼-inch pieces; set aside.</p>
<p>Heat&nbsp;¼ cup olive oil in large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion, and season with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and sizzled at the edges, 4-6 minutes. Add sausage and cook, breaking into pieces with a spoon. Continue cooking until sausage has browned, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Add harissa (or tomato paste and a pinch of red pepper flakes). Stir to coat in oil. Cook until harissa is brick red, sugars start to caramelize and oil turns a fiery orange color, about 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Add beans and season with salt and pepper. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, crush a few beans to reveal their creamy interior.</p>
<p>Add&nbsp;broth and reserved stems, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook until it reaches desired consistency, 15-20 minutes.</p>
<p>Add kale leaves and preserved lemon or lemon juice. Stir to wilt the greens. Season with salt, pepper and more red pepper flakes if you want it spicier.</p>
<p>Serve with feta and parsley.</p>
<p>Serves 6-8.</p>
