<h1>Penguins' Evgeni Malkin undergoes elbow surgery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penguins center Evgeni Malkin has undergone successful left elbow surgery, the club announced Monday morning.</p>
<p>The expected recovery time frame is three-to-four weeks, so the rehab should not carry over into next season. The surgery was performed at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital by team physician Dr. Dharmesh Vyas and Dr. John Fowler of UPMC Shoulder and Elbow Orthopedic Surgery.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan, general manager Jim Rutherford and Penguins teammates universally noted how focused and sharp Malkin looked during the brief training camp leading into the NHL postseason. But in the Toronto bubble, Malkin tallied just one point in four games, as the fifth-seeded Penguins were stunned by the No. 12-seeded Montreal Canadiens in the qualifying round.</p>
<p>On many levels, it was a disappointing ending to what was a bounce-back year for Malkin. The veteran center, who turned 34 during the postseason, came into the first training camp in September looking to recapture his “highest level.”</p>
<p>“I can still play like a top player,” Malkin said in the preseason. “I want to show to everyone I’m not done.”</p>
<p>He did just that. In 55 regular season games, he racked up 25 goals and 49 assists to lead the Penguins with 74 points. On a per-game basis, only five players in the league were more productive than Malkin, who posted 1.35 points per game. The only season in which Malkin was more productive on a per-game basis was 2011-12, when he posted 1.45 points per game and won the Hart Trophy.</p>
<p>Beyond just the offensive production, Malkin was playing some of his best two-way hockey of his career during the regular season and making better decisions with the puck. He went from a minus-25 rating in 2018-19 to plus-7. He also won 50.3% of his faceoffs, the best mark of his career.</p>
<p>His play helped buoy Bryan Rust, who enjoyed a career year with 27 goals in 55 games. During Sidney Crosby’s rehab from core muscle surgery, Malkin was one of the main reasons the Penguins went 18-6-4.</p>
<p>When it came time for the postseason, however, the Penguins were missing a punch. They scored just eight goals in four games. For the second straight postseason, their run ended in four games.</p>
