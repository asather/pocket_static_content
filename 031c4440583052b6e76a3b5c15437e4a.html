<h1>Pittsburgh-area speedways get the OK to resume races with fans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Western Pa. speedways are finally getting the green flag to race this weekend.</p>
<p>Lernerville Speedway in Sarver and Pittsburgh’s Pennsylvania Motor Speedway in Imperial will both hold races for the first time this season Friday and Saturday after having their COVID-19 safety plans approved by the state.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/other-sports/2020/06/08/Pittsburgh-area-speedways-still-waiting-to-start-their-engines/stories/202005270130" target="_blank">previously withheld approval</a>&nbsp;for speedways to open with spectators, even in the green stage of reopening, by classifying them as pro sports venues. <a href="https://ppms.com/results/3190/governor-wolf-announces-motorsports-can-open/" target="_blank">Guidelines</a> updated last week, however, classified them alongside other outdoor recreational facilities, paving the way for the tracks to open with fans.</p>
<p>And open they will, with extensive social distancing provisions in place. Lernerville <a href="https://dirtcar.life/2020/06/15/the-wait-is-over-fab4-racing-returns-friday-night/" target="_blank">said in a news release </a>that it will require spectators to sign a waiver and require masks to enter the speedway, while <a href="https://ppms.com/news/3219/ppms-finally-racing-with-fans/" target="_blank">PPMS will require them</a> in all high-contact areas including entrances, ticket booths, concession stands and restrooms. A capacity restriction will be put in place as well.</p>
<p>Those provisions cover competitors, too. Both facilities previously announced distancing requirements, including pitting and parking as many as 10 feet apart and staggering competitors’ arrival times.</p>
<p>Teams were able to return to the tracks last weekend for test and tune sessions, which were necessary to get equipment prepared for racing after a long offseason.</p>
<p>The openings come at a crucial time for Lernerville in particular, which will be able to hold its signature Firecracker 100 World of Outlaws late model race next weekend as scheduled in front of a national audience. CBS Sports Network will <a href="https://worldofoutlaws.com/news/world-of-outlaws-racing-returns-to-cbs-with-special-spotlighting-trail-blazing-journey-from-covid-to-independence-day-mega-event/?fbclid=IwAR3cADB0D2noAH2T8RYjcmQUaJvk-MAAfzP0QzBe017WGyM3ldtCKcYgS-g" target="_blank">broadcast the feature race</a>, as well as two other series races at Tri-State Speedway in Haubstadt, Ind., and Cedar Lake Speedway in New Richmond, Wisc.</p>
<p>Local teams will hit the dirt first, though. The Peoples Gas DIRTcar Sprints, Precise Racing DIRTcar Late Models, Diehl Automotive DIRTcar Big Block Modifeds and Millerstown Pic-A-Part DIRTcar/RUSH Pro Stocks will be in action Friday at Lernerville.</p>
<p>At PPMS, the divisions on the card for Saturday night include RUSH Sprint Car Series, the RUSH Sportsman Modified Series, the RUSH Late Model Dirt Series, the PPMS Pro Stocks, the Keystone Coach Works Hobby Stocks, the Open 4 Cylinders and the Young Guns.</p>
<p>Details on ticketing and social distancing guidelines can be found on the tracks’ websites <a href="https://ppms.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.lernerville.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
