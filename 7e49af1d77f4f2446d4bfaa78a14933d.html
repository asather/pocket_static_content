<h1>ISO: Pitt effort seeking retired Black teachers to help during pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Early on in the pandemic, calls went out nationally for doctors and nurses willing to step out of retirement and onto the front lines as COVID-19 threatened to overwhelm hospitals and their staffs.</p>
<p>Now, a more localized call is being made by the University of Pittsburgh to help a population hit disproportionately hard by the virus —&nbsp;one whose children may be especially at risk.</p>
<p>Only this time, it’s not doctors or nurses being sought, but retired Black teachers.</p>
<p>Pitt, its School of Education and Center for Urban Education are working to fill five paid positions in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The effort, backed by a grant from <a href="https://grable.org/" target="_blank">The Grable Foundation</a>, is seeking nominations "for high-impact teachers of Black and Brown children who live in and around Pittsburgh,” states a summary of the program released by Pitt’s center.</p>
<p>"The COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionately ravaging Black and Brown communities with devastating effects in education," it reads.</p>
<p>"Do you know retired, successful Black teachers of Black and Brown children?" it asks. "If so, do you think they may be interested in answering the call to support the learning of these communities?"</p>
<p>The individuals chosen will receive a $5,000 stipend per semester, teach remotely and meet with individual students.</p>
<p>Since early this year, as the virus first swept the country, communities of color have paid a particularly high price in numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html" target="_blank">suggests federal data</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Race and ethnicity are indicators of "other underlying conditions that impact health — including socioeconomic status, access to health care, and increased exposure to the virus due to occupation ..." including as front-line workers, the agency states.</p>
<p>For instance, the infection rate among Black and African American individuals is 2.6 times that of whites, and the rate for Hispanic or Latino individuals is 2.8 times that of whites, according to the CDC data.&nbsp; Among those two groups, hospitalization rates are 4.7 times and 4.6 times higher respectively than for whites.</p>
<p>The death rate from the virus is twice for Blacks what it is for whites, according to the agency's statistics</p>
<p>Officials at Pitt say the teachers they seek can be experienced in “any grade level or content area who promote the conditions identified for the successful teaching of all, in particular those from minority households.”</p>
<p>That includes: experience in building students’ critical thinking, building a community of learners; conceptualizing knowledge as fluid and diverse; and "fostering students’ self-awareness/actualization and sense of responsibility to their communities of origin."</p>
<p>The intended outcomes “follow guiding principles of Freedom Schools, which emphasize culturally relevant curricula as fundamental to building students’ critical thinking and inquiry skills,’’ according to the center’s summary.</p>
<p>An official with Pitt’s center could not immediately be reached Friday. But Kristen Burns, Grable’s associate director, said the $87,500 grant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/09/01/17-nonprofits-receive-grants-to-explore-innovative-education/stories/202009010109" target="_blank">is one of 17 grants to nonprofits from Grable</a> intended to encourage innovative teaching and learning through its Tomorrow campaign.</p>
<p>The campaign itself predates the pandemic. The private family foundation focuses on children and learning in southwestern Pennsylvania, she said.</p>
<p>The teachers selected will be asked to collectively consider curriculum options, meet twice-weekly with students for 90 minutes and offer remote teaching, using computer equipment as needed and technology support provided by the program.</p>
<p>For any questions about the program or the nomination process, contact Christy McGuire at CLM191@pitt.edu.</p>
