<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 05.27.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi folks. Welcome to my weekly Pirates chat. Thanks for stopping by. Glad to have you. Feel free to ask your questions now. I'll be back at noon to answer them. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, people. Away we go.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Cocoa puffs on the bed, huh? What would your preferred five minutes of 'escape' be? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Guess you saw that on Twitter, huh? Good for my wife. I'm glad she did that. Nothing fancy, honestly. And it usually involves sneaking some sort of dessert, so my kids either don't freak out or try to steal it. Lately it's been Trader Joe's Cookie Butter ice cream. Incredible.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: What are the chances that MARK CUBAN will piggyback on his purchase of THE O, and also buy the Pirates from BOB NUTHOUSE/Nutting (lol) ?? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I decided to randomly email Cuban last summer to see if he would respond to that question. This is what he said: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/07/30/pittsburgh-pirates-owner-mark-cuban-dallas-mavericks-bob-nutting/stories/201907300055" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/07/30/pittsburgh-pira...</a> <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: To summarize, one, he doesn't believe they're even for sale. Valid point. Two, there isn't a strong, young audience for baseball. Also a valid point -- and the sport is making things worse with this financial junk. Three, Cuban doesn't want to spend the time necessary to own a baseball team. Not sure I buy that one. If Nutting put the Pirates up for sale, regardless of what he said, I think Cuban would at least have a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: Why is money always a problem in baseball? This is getting ridiculous. I completely understand wanting to get your worth amid the health risk, but taking a pay cut for half of one season can not be the worst thing to happen to these guys. Gerrit Cole can survive on $9 million a year and play baseball if I can go work at Walmart everyday risking my health making far less. It‚Äôs time to get this plan agreed on. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think a lot of people feel that way, Scott. You're not wrong. It's a terrible look for the sport. I also see the players' side, where they think they agreed to something already. They're also wary of owners who are saying they've lost a ton of money and don't offer incontrovertible proof of that, specifically as it relates to those losses including only baseball revenue. There's a lot of distrust there and has been for some time. It's sad. Why it's always a problem likely has more to do with that than the present; years and years of sniping, screwing each other over, etc. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: One thing I don't understand is why the sport isn't willing to just move on for a year. I like Gerrit Cole a lot. Think he's a tremendous pitcher. This isn't meant to insult him. But if you think the deal sucks for you, OK, fine. Sit out. No harm. Come back next year. But let's try to put a product out there with the people who want to play and feel it makes sense for them. I feel like the dude making the league minimum who is trying to make an impression and provide for his family is naturally going to be willing to assume more risk than those who make $30-plus-million/year. Is there anything wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>GH</strong>: Hi Jason, Michael Jordan &amp; Tom Brady are regarded as the GOAT‚Äôs of their sports. Who do you think are the GOAT‚Äôs of baseball and hockey? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: First off, I don't know if I agree with you that those guys are the greatest basketball and football players of all-time; however, for the sake of your question, let's just move on. ... Best hockey player ability-wise, in my opinion, is Mario Lemieux. But I understand why you can't say Best of All-Time, due to all the time he missed. At that point, it's hard to not say Gretzky, right? Behind him would probably be Bobby Orr followed by Gordie Howe. Baseball-wise, I'd probably go Babe Ruth followed by Willie Mays and then maybe Ted Williams or Ty Cobb.</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: Jason, I know you can't know which players kept theirselves in the best condition, but who do you see the season delay helping and who do you potentially see it hurting the most? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Individually, that's a good one. Honestly, from what I know, I don't worry about whether Pirates players are doing enough. They are. I could see a shortened season really helping someone like Jarrod Dyson, because of his age. (He's not old but obviously a vet who I think would benefit from fewer games.) Less injury risk for Polanco. That's something. Someone like Keller might benefit from more starts and learning throughout the year. Could make developing a little tougher, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: with all the problems for the pirates with the fans, why isn't there more of a grass roots movement for all fans not attend games this year? it would be a perfect time for all fans to band together and just stop attending, with social distancing and people not feeling safe i think it would be "as trump says" PERFECT TIMING <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: There likely won't be any fans at MLB games this season. Also, no need to politicize a baseball chat.</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: They have to draft a catcher with their first pick...Don't they? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I go back and forth on this. I certainly think it's something to consider. I also really like Heston Kjerstad, the Arkansas outfielder with a ton of power. Hard to disagree there. I think it might come down to what they feel like they can get with their comp pick at No. 31. ESPN's Kiley McDaniel has them taking Kjerstad at No. 7 and Arizona's Austin Wells at No. 31. I would imagine that one of those two picks will be a catcher.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: The pirates should sign Yasiel Puig. He would be a good addition to the club and now would most likely be very affordable. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thank you for the weekly mention of Yasiel Puig. Would not be a weekly Pirates chat -- or 2020 season -- without it.</p>
<p><strong>üêê</strong>: When Is this transaction freeze over with? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I would imagine after they come to some sort of agreement. If they come to some sort of agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Butch</strong>: What is the likely deadline on coming to a agreement for there to be baseball this season? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey Butch. You're probably looking at the end of next week. If they can't get something done by then, it's going to make it really tough to play 82 games and finish by a reasonable date. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Folks, our numbers show a decent amount of people in this chat, but I'm all out of questions. If you're scared to ask something because you think it sounds stupid or whatever, don't be. Fire away. About baseball or, really, anything.</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: With only 5 rounds what do college seniors do who dont get drafted but would have? Work at Target? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They can sign for $20,000. That stinks, I agree, but that's what was negotiated. I suppose they could work at Target, too, if they really wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: If you're drafting based on need in baseball, you've more than likely screwed yourself over. Best Player Available is always the best strategy, which I think baseball people basically all agree on. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Josh, you're very adamant about your answer. FWIW, I agree with you. But I do think it's worthy of being a conversation topic with Bailey -- who's gonna go, what, five spots later? -- and a Pirates system that has literally no catching depth. Also, something else people basically all agree on is that teams evaluate prospects differently than we do on the outside. Maybe they have Bailey that high. You don't know. I don't know. But it's at least close.</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: Odds that PGH gets the first pick in 2021 if there is a season? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't gamble or bet, so I have very little conception of "odds." However, I would say "not very good." I'm sure some of you think I'm nuts for thinking this, but I honestly think they will improve a pretty decent amount in 2020. Why do I think that? Because things got really bad in 2019. Guys didn't wanna play for that group. Players were underprepared, especially when it came to pitching. The clubhouse was just ... blah. It was the polar opposite of the environment Derek Shelton has cultivated this spring. Are the Pirates deep enough? Not for 162 games. But they have enough talent to be respectable, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>Butch</strong>: Most interesting Pirates player you have interviewed? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hmm ... good question. There are a few. Clay Holmes is "interesting," in that he's super nerdy and smart and always into something unique. Joe Musgrove is a terrific talker, open and honest. Keone Kela, too. Jameson Taillon is one of the best people you could ever meet, plus interesting and articulate. Jacob Stallings is tremendous for a few different reasons. It's hard to pick just one, honestly. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Oh, and geez, Steven Brault is super nice and wacky. Derek Holland has all kinds of strange hobbies and interests that he's more than willing to talk about. It's a very good room.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Your opinion, the owners are trying to break the union with the latest proposal, and/or make the highest paid players look like the bad guys? Yay or nay? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think it's that nuanced, John. I think the owners are 1. Starting a negotiation, meaning they're going to start way off to the side of where they eventually want to end up. 2. They're playing this so, yeah, the players look like the jerks if this doesn't happen, when we all know something like a canceled season isn't attributable to one side of the other.</p>
<p><strong>GH</strong>: Agree on your GOAT answers. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Good to hear, GH. If not we'd have to kick you out of this chat. (I'm kidding.)</p>
<p><strong>wvpirate</strong>: I saw a couple teams release about 25 of their minor league players. Do you see the Pirates doing that soon as well? Especially since there will be no minor league baseball this year <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I've heard the Pirates hope/intent to pay minor leaguers through June, so I don't know if anything is imminent. I also think that there will be a taxi/development squad, which will feature minor league guys. But as far as making moves like that, yeah, I could see them happening to the Pirates. Could see them happening to a lot of teams, frankly, if there is indeed no season. But I don't see them happening today or tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Butch</strong>: If MLB resumes is there still likely to be a expanded postseason? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yep. I think there will be. Honestly, I think there has to be to make everything work. While I understand the money squabbles, one of the things that should help the most is an expanded postseason (and more money).</p>
<p><strong>wvpirate</strong>: Do you see the instructional league and Arizona Fall League starting earlier and expanding? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hmm ... I haven't thought of that. Good question. Yeah, I could definitely see that happening, although not before the season ends. And even if the season is just two weeks longer, that could affect those things. Also think it depends on where COVID-19 stuff is at that point. But from a baseball standpoint, with a lost minor league season, it would make sense for those to expand.</p>
<p><strong>Itsyoboi</strong>: Do you think any pirates would not play this year because they don‚Äôt think they would be paid enough? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Umm ... That's hard to say. I don't think any of the minimum-salary guys would object. I think that's probably the case around the sport. Beyond that, we're talking Archer, Polanco, Kela, Bell, Trevor, Musgrove, etc. Archer and Bell have declined interview requests. Have not tried with Polanco. Kela and Trevor did not respond to texts. Musgrove said he's ready to go and would want to play. If I had to wager guesses, I would say those guys would all play. But I can't say that for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Butch</strong>: Do you think Mitch Keller can still be a top of the rotation starting pitcher? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I do. I think there's still some development in there, which is completely normal for his age/stature. But the stuff is there. The talent is there. He just needs someone to help him figure it out. I'm a lot more confident with this group's ability to do that than I was with the last one.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Cerny</strong>: The prospects in the minors, where will they train at? Will they play inter-squad games since there is no minor league season? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Likely Pirate City, as I understand it. There will also be a taxi-squad with the MLB club. So, some of them will be there.</p>
<p><strong>wvpirate</strong>: See if you agree with this. Instant replay has gotten out of control. If each team only has one chance for a call for instant replay. And an extra one for extra innings. Then only the real bad calls would be in dispute. No more if you get it right. You get another one. And the game would move quicker <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: This is probably an unpopular ***online*** sports opinion, but I hate replay. Takes away the spontaneity of sports. I like numbers and technology. I use that stuff when I write. But if you ask me my opinion, as a sports fan, I miss when you could react to something and it stayed that way. I miss the days before sports became science or a spreadsheet. So, I'm fine with having one challenge per game. I'd be fine with having no challenges per game and just living with the results.</p>
<p><strong>Be ez</strong>: if they agree to a deal will the players start reporting in a couple days or will they be quartine for 2 weeks? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: If they finalize a deal, I don't believe there is any sort of plan to re-quarantine. Say they agree to something. I think the plan would be for players to report and be ready around June 10 or so.</p>
<p><strong>Sunner in the sunshine</strong>: Why is Tony Clark trying to negotiate the players' side through the media? Is there no one with the players' union able to put a muzzle on him? He is destroying the little leverage they have. Also the high end players need to zip it as no fan is sympathizing with their "plight". Take note from the NHL and NBA. Very little is heard and a lot is being negotiated and resolved! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Tony Clark isn't the only one in this negotiating through the media, trust me. He's just the only one using his name. Or one of the only ones. But your point is solid. Nobody wins when you do this crap publicly. They all look dumb. The NHL and NBA have handled this as they should -- behind closed doors, then emerge and say something when there's something to say. I don't know why MLB can't keep a lid on it, but I wish it would.</p>
<p><strong>Drew</strong>: Well before the pandemic, MLB had proposed eliminating some of the minor league teams in the name of better efficiency/cost savings. With the elimination of the minor league season, don't you think that many of those teams may be at greater risk of bankruptcy than before? Minor league owners can't have as deep pockets and revenue streams that the MLB owners have...plus, couldn't fewer teams/levels also affect player development? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yes, absolutely. There's an entire business angle to all of this that doesn't get talked about enough: minor league impacts. Those owners rely almost exclusively on gate money they're simply not going to get this year. Granted, their account is different than MLB clubs, but it's generally a bad sign for a business when there's no more revenue coming in.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: For the theoretical 20-man taxi squad--one would assume 31-40 would be rest of 40-man roster. That would mean 41-50 would be players on minor league deals, so how do you see Pirates playing that? Guys with some experience but low upside (Elmore or Noesi), guys with experience but low upside (Marvel), or projects to develop (Oliva)? A little of everything? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yeah, probably a little of everything, honestly. I could also see them using it as a way to get guys like Quinn Priester or Brennan Malone work. As a way to develop top-end prospects even though there won't be a minor league season. And if you think at all that a guy might help the MLB club, then you should probably include him, too.</p>
<p><strong>Itsyoboi</strong>: will Cole tucker start much this year? Have a good one and be easy <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thanks, itsyoboi. I think it's going to depend on how he hits. If Tucker hits like he did in spring, then I think he will get opportunities. However, if they turn to Hayes at third, keep Newman at shortstop and Frazier at first, innings and starts might be tough to come by. Regardless, these things always have a way of working out. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Any additional questions, gang?</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I would totally disagree with the Tony Clark point. Everything from owners is being leaked, forcing union to respond, not vice versa. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Maybe I didn't make my point well enough. I agree with you. All kinds of leaks. We might disagree on the need to respond, but I do understand if you're Clark or a player, why you want to articulate your thoughts and feelings. I just think on the whole, there shouldn't be leaks, and there shouldn't be players talking the way Blake Snell did. None of that is constructive.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: I think including big time prospects like that would mean no service or anything like that is going to trigger or absolutely no games get played in; not starting a clock or throwing a guy out way before he's ready. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think that's what we're proposing. For the Pirates, I think someone like Priester would have a tough time saying he's even ready for games. Dude was in high school last year. But would he benefit by being around that whole routine? Absolutely. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. Looks like that will do it for this week. A lot of really good questions. Thank you for participating. Let's do this again next Wednesday.</p>
