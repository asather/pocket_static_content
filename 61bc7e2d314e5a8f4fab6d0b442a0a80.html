<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The state Department of Health on Monday reported 12 new COVID-19 deaths and 356 new positive cases of the disease. It was the 22nd straight day the state has reported fewer than 1,000 new cases.</p>
<p>The state has reported 72,282 positive cases of COVID-19 and 5,567 deaths since its first recorded death from COVID-19 on March 18. Fifty-five of the state’s 67 counties have recorded at least one death.</p>
<p>Allegheny County reported no new deaths from COVID-19 and just one new case of the deadly disease, according to its health department. Originally, the state and county had different numbers of cases due to an issue with the reporting system, but that issue has been resolved. The county is reporting 151 deaths — 140 confirmed and 11 probable. However, the state said Allegheny County had one additional death, making its total 164.</p>
<p>No other deaths were reported in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Since Allegheny County’s first case was announced March 14, it has had 1,912 positive cases — 1,791 confirmed and 121 probable.</p>
<p>Allegheny continues to have the highest figures in Western Pennsylvania and is followed by&nbsp;Beaver County and Westmoreland counties. Based on the state’s data, Beaver had 590 cases and 73 deaths and Westmoreland had 449 cases and 38 deaths.</p>
<p>Of the 1,912 cases in Allegheny County, 270 of those — 14% -—&nbsp;belong to healthcare workers, the county said. So far, there have been 340 hospitalizations, past or present, because of the respiratory disease. Of those, at least 131 needed intensive care and 67 required a mechanical ventilator.</p>
