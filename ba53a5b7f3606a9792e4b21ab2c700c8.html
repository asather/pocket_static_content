<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 02.10.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Brian Batko</strong>: How we doin' folks? Pitchers and catchers (and writers) are reporting to Bradenton, but I'm still here in Pittsburgh, chatting Steelers and whatever else is on your mind. Let's get to it.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel in Ohio</strong>: After watching the XFL this weekend, I have a big question. Why do the Steelers stick with a punter such as Jordan Berry, when there are clearly better options on the street? One example is Marquette King? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I wouldn't be surprised to see them part with Berry this offseason. Thought they might do it last year, and I wouldn't say he had a great 2019. But Marquette King specifically, there's probably a reason he's not in the NFL anymore. He's the rare case of a punting malcontent. Had some issues in Oakland and Denver, I believe. Maybe he'll get his NFL career back through the XFL.</p>
<p><strong>Rodzilla</strong>: Why don't the Steelers have more cap space to work with for this year? I thought AB's cap hit coming off the books would give us cap relief. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Simply put, because other guys are getting paid more money now than they had been before. Especially Stephon Tuitt, Joe Haden and one Ben Roethlisberger. Don't fret too much though, they usually find ways to clear out some room.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: Who wins more games this upcoming season ? The Steelers or Pirates ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: This is one over/under I'm confident in taking the Buccos</p>
<p><strong>Tony </strong>: If MR is the back up qb for the steelers this year what can they to speed up his reads when he drops back to pass, he takes to longto get rid of the pass. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Quicker decision-making and pocket presence is part of the development process for any young quarterback. Should help Mason Rudolph to have Matt Canada working with him as a dedicated QBs coach.</p>
<p><strong>John Joyce</strong>: I love Steelers, since 1950 I was 12. Lack courage to do Projections. What do u see us doing at QB and Off Line? Thanks. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't think I have any more courage than you, John, but here goes: they'll stand pat at QB for the most part, based on Art Rooney II's comments last week <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/05/Art-Rooney-II-Steelers-team-president-veteran-quarterback-Ben-Roethlisberger-running-game/stories/202002050167" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/05/Art-Rooney-II-...</a><br> <br> As for OL, I do think they'll move on from Ramon Foster at left guard. From there, it's probably more likely that they'll add through the draft than free agency. And then a competition of sorts involving any new blood, Zach Banner, Chuks Okorafor and perhaps BJ Finney is he's re-signed.</p>
<p><strong>rman</strong>: Hi Brian. Two questions about Ben. First, has he really gained a bunch of weight or does his beard make it appear that way? Second, has there ever been any specifics about his surgery beyond the fact that it involved his elbow? Thanks, you've been doing a great job ! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thanks, rman. I'm sorry, but I do not have any details on Ben's current weight. Not too many specifics on the exact nature of the injury, although he has said it wasn't Tommy John surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Simon in UK</strong>: Hi, can the Steelers really build a serious Superbowl challenge with a QB, regardless of talent taking up nearly 20% of its salary cap? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yes, you still can, but it's more difficult in some respects. Russell Wilson and Aaron Rodgers are way up there in cap hits, and I'd say their teams remain legitimate contenders. We'll see how the Chiefs fare once they back up the armored truck for Pat Mahomes.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Hey Brian...curious if any Steelers met or were close to Kobe? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I know James Conner said on social media that he had just met Kobe about a week prior to his death. Not sure about any other Steelers, especially since so many of them have come into prominence post-Kobe's NBA career.</p>

<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Would it be unteasonable for the Steelers to re-acquire QB Dobbs? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Maybe not unreasonable, but he's still under contract for one more season with Jacksonville, so you'd have to trade back for him or hope the Jags cut him. I don't see it happening.</p>
<p><strong>Titan in Charlotte</strong>: Hey Brian, Trevor Lawrence would look good in black and gold...tank? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ha, unless something really goes south with No. 7, the timing might be a little off. But don't worry, Clemson has another phenom waiting in the wings. D.J. Uiagalelei is a 6-5, 243-pounder with a cannon for an arm who enrolled in January. No. 1 QB recruit in his high school class, naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Cathy G-R</strong>: Thanks for your insight! Love this chat <br> <strong>Cathy G-R</strong>: My question was about getting some depth at QB position <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thank you, Cathy. I don't know that it's depth they need at QB. It's quality. They're already four-deep right now with Ben, Rudolph, Duck Hodges, Paxton Lynch. But do any of those guys fill you with much confidence as a backup/No. 3?</p>
<p><strong>FatBuddy</strong>: Why not interview Hines Ward for the receivers coach, he made the most of his talents and should be able to pass that along? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hines seems to be enjoying his tenure with the Jets so far, and maybe both he and the Steelers are fine being on parallel courses right now. The latest is that a different former Steelers wideout is in the mix for the position: Jerricho Cotchery <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/10/steelers-receiver-coach-Jerricho-Cotchery-Bryan-McClendon/stories/202002100082" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/10/steelers-recei...</a></p>
<p><strong>Jimbova</strong>: I read how Peter King didn't vote for Troy b/c he thought that he'd be a shoe in for the HOF. Do you think that was fair? Also, do you think that Antonio Brown makes it to the HOF? Voters aren't supposed to look at all that extra stuff. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, I don't think that was fair. It was a case of a scribe getting too cute with the vote, but whatever. It's his prerogative. Speaking of prerogatives, yes, I do believe Antonio will get in. He might have to wait a while, though. But I think what's most important to him is that he'll be able to claim he's the GOAT even if he never plays another down.</p>
<p><strong>NowOrNever</strong>: I've heard opinions that this is going to be more of their old school approach to FA. With Ben's health in question and career winding down and a GM that's year to year, I would think we'd see a more aggressive Colbert similar to 2019 than the more conservative pre-2019 approach. They may need to mortgage the future a little to get it to work out cap wise but we saw this year, the future isn't great and it's going to take a top 10'ish pick to get your next franchise QB anyway. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: You've already seen the aggressiveness increase. The Devin Bush trade-up was big. Swapping a first-rounder for Minkah Fitzpatrick was basically unprecedented for the Steelers. But you can't mortgage the futures of guys like, say, T.J. Watt or Minkah. They'll need their big deals at some point, probably sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><strong>CanadianSteelersFan </strong>: Im expecting Edmunds to have a big improvement in his 3rd year. A full training camp with an All Pro FS, and a much improved secondary should bode well for his developement. Do you agree playing next to star FS will help him elevate his game and or help disguise some of his weaknesses? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Eh, I think it's more about his own progression than the guy he's playing next to. If anything, teams are going to target you more if you're the perceived weak link among a secondary with a bunch of Pro Bowl-caliber players.</p>
<p><strong>Yogi</strong>: Hi Brian. Just heard NFL may be interested in flexing some Sunday games to Monday night. I know it is all about the money. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi, Yogi. I hadn't heard that. But I can't see how they would, unless maybe they want to do more of those double-headers like they've put on in Week 1 for the last several years.</p>
<p><strong>Steeltowntim@aol.com</strong>: any chance we trade Tomlin for a couple first round picks?? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: My magic 8-ball says "don't count on it"</p>
<p><strong>Bats for Prez</strong>: Should they go to the Bank of Ben to clear out additional cap space they will need to be very active in FA? If they added an additional year to push $ into the future but didn't impact Ben's actual take from this contract, think he would sign that? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No idea. They did restructure Stephon Tuitt last offseason, but that wasn't until late July.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon is Steelers Country</strong>: Does anyone actually know if Ben’s elbow was an issue for him during those first two games ? Or was he that bad and unprepared. Either way did we see regardless how his rehab goes, the Ben we get this year. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It did seem to be bothering him toward the end of that first half against Seattle. A couple players mentioned that there were some complaints from Ben in the week leading up to that game, which would seem to suggest that his struggles against New England weren't injury related.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Medium Chest</strong>: Have you heard of the Steelers Having interest in Greg Olsen? <br> <strong>NowOrNever</strong>: Thanks Brian but they should be able to manage the cap space to sign Minkah and TJ. Ben's $ will help with that cause. They have this year/maybe next to win this or they're looking at borderline playoffs until they find the next franchise QB. I like MR, just don't see him as THE guy even if they have a stout run game. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sorry, the previous answer didn't go through. Doesn't seem like the Steelers are on Olsen's list of suitors, so I'm thinking they aren't interested.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Batko</strong>: But yes, generally, I agree with those who see the window closing for the Steelers, at least for a little while, once the Roethlisberger era ends. Odds of Rudolph being the successor don't look good after last year.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/.media/2/2019/07/31/e8cb627f-df86-4bcb-a445-72a34e955033.jpg" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Bats for Prez</strong>: My opinion - work the cap space to get best fit FA TE and draft OL and TE with the 1st three picks. They've been good at getting quality WRs in later rounds and RBs can be found there too. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I like the way you think. Although the Steelers might get tempted if a WR or RB high on their board falls to them due to the surplus of prospects at those positions. Assuming they keep Vance McDonald, they might not need to grab a free agent tight end.</p>
<p><strong>Rodzilla</strong>: Would it make sense for the Steelers or JJSS side to get a new deal this year. His down year might have made him more affordable. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Probably makes the most sense for both to play wait-and-see. Because if I'm JuJu, I'm saying "more affordable? look what I did my first two years with a different QB."</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: How bad is the talent level in the XFL that and ex PSU QB looked somewhat competent ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It's uh, not great. But seemingly better than what the AAF had. I caught a little bit of it over the weekend. Kind of enjoyed seeing Cardale Jones throw to Eli Rogers here and there. Plus, the league is doing a couple things to make up for the talent gap. Quirky kickoffs, no extra points, etc. Hopefully Landry Jones will be back soon so we can see what he has left in the tank, too.</p>
<p><strong>Patrick</strong>: Any chance the steelers look to add an outside LB coach such as Kevin Greene? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Haven't heard that, but it would be somewhat equivalent to the Matt Canada hire, considering DC Keith Butler is technically the OLBs coach in addition to his coordinating role.</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: i thought when the Steelers solidified their defense by obtaining M. Fitzpatrick, they would solidified the offense too by obtaining Ryan Fitzpatrick after game 4 when Miami bench him, so will the Steelers now learn their lesson and get an NFL quarterback with experience to backup Big Ben? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Doesn't sound like it. All indications are that Rudolph is going to get another shot at backing up Ben.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Some mock drafts have Steelers taking qb Jalen Hurts in second round. Is that out of the realm or would they go for it if he's still available??? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Probably out of the realm, dear Guest. It's not like they don't have other holes to fill that allows them to take a big swing on a guy like Hurts.</p>
<p><strong>Bob</strong>: I sure don't follow all the concerns about what the team will be like when Ben gets back. If he had been reinserted in the lineup in mid November there would have been several more wins and a playoff run. Even if he was only at 75%.<br> <br> With this defense and hopefully Conner and JuJu at full strength, I think next season is looking REALLY good. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Pretty Bob-timistic. But there's nothing wrong with that!</p>
<p><strong>Oregon is Steelers Country</strong>: Does Minka get his wish and is allowed to channel his inner Troy ? Seems like hes a playmaker, lets let him go make some plays. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, I can certainly see that. He seems to have the physical capabilities and the mental aptitude for it. His playmaking decreased as the season went on, but teams aren't gonna go near a guy racking up picks and fumble recoveries at the rate he was. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: OK everyone, that's time. Time for lunch, time to go, time to end the chat. But Ray Fittipaldo and I are doing a listener mailbag podcast later this week, so if you have any questions you want us to address, send us a tweet or an email. Thanks, as always.</p>
