<h1>Two Catholic schools to close, two to merge</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two Catholic schools are closing and two more are merging in the Diocese of Pittsburgh as the pandemic-induced economic plunge has worsened the long-term conditions that have already been straining the Catholic parochial school system.</p>
<p>The Diocese of Pittsburgh on Friday announced the closings of St. Patrick School in Canonsburg and Our Lady of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Harrison Township, effective June 30.</p>
<p>The diocese also announced the merger of St. Joseph Elementary School in Verona and St. John the Baptist School in Plum Borough, effective July 1.</p>
<p>Parish schools have already been closing or merging at a steady rate in recent years amid a decline in enrollment, which has prompted the creation of regional schools that don’t rely on a single parish for support.</p>
<p>But the economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has made things worse.</p>
<p>“Sadly, with funding sources critically reduced due to the impact of the global pandemic, we do not have the ability to financially sustain every one of our school buildings,” Bishop David Zubik said in a statement.</p>
<p>“However, our spiritual and financial commitment to Catholic education remains strong,” he said. “These decisions were made with exactly that mission in mind —&nbsp;to preserve and protect Catholic education in our diocese.”</p>
<p>The diocese also announced the creation of the&nbsp;South Regional Catholic Elementary School Inc., which will oversee planning for diocesan schools in that region. Similar regional groupings have previously been formed in other areas of the diocese.</p>
