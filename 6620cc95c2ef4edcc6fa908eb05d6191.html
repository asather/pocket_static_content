<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NHL and the NHL Players’ Association announced Thursday that the league is targeting July 10 for the start of training camps for the 24 playoff teams.</p>
<p>The announcement, which comes three days after NHL players were permitted back into team facilities, offers further hope we could see games in August.</p>
<p>But the joint statement included an important caveat. It read that full-squad training camps will open July 10 “provided that medical and safety conditions allow and the parties have reached an overall agreement on resuming play.”</p>
<p>So the start date of training camps, which is Phase 3 of the NHL’s return-to-play protocol, could change. The statement said the length of camps and the start date for the formal resumption of play, aka Phase 4, are not set in stone. Still, we continue to inch toward the return of NHL hockey sometime this summer.</p>

The NHL has not revealed where the games will be played. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/05/26/NHL-adopts-24-team-playoff-format-if-it-can-resume-season/stories/202005260106" target="_blank">Pittsburgh made a pitch</a> to be a playoff hub city.</p>
<p>Phase 2 began Monday. Penguins players are permitted to work out and skate at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex with restrictions, including only six players being allowed in the facility at a time. Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, Bryan Rust and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/06/10/Jake-Guentzel-back-on-the-ice-as-Penguins-begin-Phase-2/stories/202006100113" target="_blank">Jake Guentzel</a> are among the players in town for the optional workouts.</p>
