<h1> Consider all the issues before voting </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I read the front-page story about a farmer from Lawrence County who says he will not vote for President Donald Trump (Aug. 15, “V<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/vote2020/2020/08/15/Volant-farmer-Rick-Telesz-Democratic-convention-why-switch-to-Biden/stories/202008150023" target="_blank">olant Farmer to Speak at DNC on Why He’s Switching to Biden</a>”).</p>
<p>He will not vote for Mr. Trump because he feels Mr. Trump’s economic policies vis-a-vis China have hurt his profit line. Wow. This man cares only about his own personal profit and never considers all the other issues present in this campaign.</p>
<p>That is the ultimate act of selfishness.</p>
