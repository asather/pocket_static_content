<h1>Is it time for Pirates to worry about Trevor Williams?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>KANSAS CITY — After the 2018 season, when the Pirates finished three games over .500, Trevor Williams was viewed as a reason for optimism and a building block for the starting rotation, the result of his tremendous second half.</p>
<p>Williams had a 1.38 ERA in 12 starts, winning seven. Only Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell (1.17 ERA) was better.</p>
<p>Things are a little different for Williams now after the Pirates’ 7-4 loss to the Royals on Saturday at Kauffman Stadium. It was his seventh loss in eight decisions, while the right-hander’s ERA has ballooned to 6.35.</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton said afterward that Williams would likely remain in the rotation for the rest of the season, which only increases the importance of the 28-year-old proving he remains an integral part of the team's future.</p>
<p>“I believe I’m a good pitcher, and I believe I can continue to get outs like I’ve always gotten outs,” Williams said. “I have to be more consistent. I’ve got to prove it to this new staff, and I have to prove it to the guys so they can trust me. I’m looking forward to doing that in my last few starts.”</p>
<p>Williams also allowed two more home runs, bringing to 12 his total for the season, including nine over his past four starts. Two pitchers in all of baseball have given up more in 2020.</p>
<p>Ten of those have come on fastballs, which has always been an important pitch for Williams.</p>
<p>“I have to stop giving up homers,” Williams said. “It’s really that simple.”</p>
<p>And the Pirates need to figure out what's going on with Williams, whether it’s the stuff, how he’s pitching, his delivery or something entirely new. Because it’s tough, if not impossible, to commit a rotation spot to someone with an ERA as high as his.</p>
<p>“It’s just the consistency of execution,” Shelton said. “We see it in stretches, and he loses it during the game.</p>
<p>“We've got to get him back on track, executing in his zones.”</p>
<p>Even though he struggled, the Pirates were in the game midway through, until a mistake from Williams contributed to a three-run fifth for the Royals, who took a 6-3 lead.</p>
<p>After Kansas City scored one on a single from Salvador Perez, they got another via Williams’ errant, backhanded flip of a dribbler hit by Alex Gordon, the ball sailing out of Jacob Stallings’ reach.</p>
<p>Williams did not realize he had more time. He also said he should have either gotten around it more or barehanded the ball.</p>
<p>“He tried to do too much there,” Shelton said. “It ended up getting away, and the game kind of got away from us.”</p>
<p>That it did, as the Royals tacked on two more with a sacrifice fly and Kyle Crick’s bases-loaded walk. The Pirates hit three solo homers and scratched out a run in the eighth, but it wasn't enough.</p>
<p>The good news for the Pirates is that Josh Bell has seemingly found his stroke at the plate.</p>
<p>Bell homered in the first, taking a sinker the other way for his second in as many games and sixth on the season. He added a single in the seventh for a two-hit night.</p>
<p>Both Shelton and Bell admitted afterward that, although the first baseman has shown some signs of breaking out of his season-long funk, this one looks a little bit different.</p>
<p>“I think it does look more real,” Shelton said. “We’re seeing him consistently hit the fastball and drive it more.”</p>
<p>Ironically, the work has come without batting practice. The Pirates didn’t take it Friday because of rain, and an armed standoff with police shortened pregame work by a good bit Saturday.</p>
<p>Bell was limited to 20 or 30 swings of soft toss, and he seemed to like it.</p>
<p>“I might’ve taken batting practice for the last time this year,” Bell said with a laugh. “It seems like less is more, and I’m going to try to ride that wave for as long as I can.”</p>
<p>The Pirates also got home runs from Bryan Reynolds and Adam Frazier. Reynolds' was just the second in his past 17 games, while Frazier continues to improve.</p>
<p>Frazier was hitting .191 on Aug. 28 but has since collected hits in 13 of his past 14 games, raising his average to .237. Enough to revisit an offseason trade? Maybe.</p>
<p>One positive pitching performance for the Pirates succeeded Williams: Austin Davis, the 27-year-old lefty they got from the Phillies for cash and a player to be named later making his Pittsburgh debut by working a 1-2-3 sixth.</p>
<p>Davis has racked up plenty of strikeouts — 64 in 58 ⅓ major league innings — but he’s also struggled with control and making too many mistakes, as evidenced by his 5.86 career ERA.</p>
<p>If the Pirates can get Davis right, they could have a solid relief option, someone with a strong fastball as well as a few above-average secondary pitches.</p>
<p>“The fastball looked good and came out of his hand,” Shelton said. “He got behind to the first hitter and came right back and executed. Threw a couple good sliders. Good first outing. Happy for him.”</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>Bell now has 17 career home runs in interleague play, tying him with Pedro Alvarez, Brian Giles and Kevin Young for third-most in team history behind Starling Marte (18) and Andrew McCutchen (20).</p>
