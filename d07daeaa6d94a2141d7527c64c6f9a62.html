<h1>Ex-trooper loses appeal in assault case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former Pennsylvania State Police trooper lost his appeal Thursday of his 2019 conviction for <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/01/23/Pennsylvania-police-trooper-Scott-Richard-Mang-jailed-assault-charge-wife-domestic-Plum/stories/201901230097" target="_blank">threatening and assaulting</a> his wife.</p>
<p>The appeal by Scott Richard Mang, 34, was rejected by state Superior Court, which <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Superior/out/j-a14037-20m%20-%20104540728111843647.pdf" target="_blank">ruled</a> in a 12-page opinion that he was rightly convicted despite Mr. Mang’s assertion that the trial court erred because he did not truly intend to hurt his wife.</p>
<p>In January of 2019, Mr. Mang and his wife were watching football and drinking alcohol at their home in Plum. Around 1 a.m., Ms. Mang began&nbsp;“berating” her husband,&nbsp;“putting him down” for taking too long in their shared bathroom, according to court documents.</p>
<p>The confrontation evolved into an argument lasting over an hour with the couple screaming at each other throughout the house. Mr. Mang punched their bathroom door several times, damaging the door frame and putting several holes in the door itself.</p>
<p>Ms. Mang threatened to call the police, an assertion which made Mr. Mang more angry. He retrieved a loaded firearm from Ms. Mang’s nightstand and threatened to kill himself, then said the pair would “both be dead.”</p>
<p>The wife then ran to a nearby house, telling the neighbor,&nbsp;“He has a gun. He’s going to kill me.” They called 911 and a&nbsp;Plum police officertook Mr. Mang into custody without further incident, court records state.</p>
<p>The charges led him to be suspended without pay. He was convicted of terroristic threats and simple assault, and he subsequently appealed that conviction.</p>
<p>Trooper Mang argued to the appellate court that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction of terroristic threats, even as he acknowledged picking up the gun, threatening to kill himself and commenting that he and his wife would be dead.</p>
<p>The threat was “a spur-of-the-moment remark resulting from anger during a heated confrontation,” he argued.</p>
<p>The court disagreed.&nbsp;“Because the&nbsp;circumstances support the finding that Mang had intended to terrorize his wife,&nbsp;during a long fight, by picking up her loaded firearm and stating that he would&nbsp;kill them both, we cannot grant Mang relief on this claim,”&nbsp;Senior Judge John L. Musmanno wrote in the opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Mang also claimed that there wasn’t enough evidence to convict him of simple assault. He was convicted under a law which states&nbsp;“a person is guilty of assault if he attempts by physical menace to put&nbsp;another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury.”</p>
<p>He said he had no intent to cause such fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Superior Court again agreed with the initial conviction, saying&nbsp;the evidence&nbsp;“supports a finding that Mang intended to place Mrs. Mang in fear of serious&nbsp;bodily injury by retrieving a loaded firearm and stating that they would ‘both&nbsp;be dead.’”</p>
<p>Mr. Mang was originally sentenced to 18 months of probation, and is required to go through a mental health evaluation and a batterer’s intervention program. His attorney did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
