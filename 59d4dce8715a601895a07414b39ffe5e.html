<h1>Biden campaign names two Philadelphia-based operatives to top positions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The effort to secure Pennsylvania for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will be led — at least in part —&nbsp;by two Philadelphia-based political operatives.</p>
<p>Leading the campaign as state director will be Brendan McPhillips, a longtime campaign guru who most recently managed Pete Buttigieg’s momentous primary win in Iowa in February.&nbsp;Sinceré Harris, who has directed the state Democratic Party through the period following Donald Trump’s election, will serve as senior adviser to Mr. Biden’s Pennsylvania effort.</p>
<p>The Biden campaign announced the hires on Tuesday, touting the pair’s history of helping Democratic candidates win in Pennsylvania and — in Mr. McPhillips’ case — elsewhere in the U.S.</p>
<p>Mr. McPhillips, a veteran of previous Democratic presidential campaigns here, managed former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum’s winning Democratic primary bid in 2018, then — according to a report in Politico — split ways with the candidate before Mr. Gillum lost in the general election to now Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.</p>
<p>Before that, Mr. McPhillips served as campaign manager for former Braddock Mayor John Fetterman’s U.S. Senate bid, which ended in a third-place finish in the primary.</p>
<p>Ms. Harris, as executive director of the state Democrats, has overseen administration of the party while it has picked up Congressional seats, made gains in the state Legislature and re-elected two of its most prominent members, Gov. Tom Wolf and U.S. Sen. Bob Casey — a record that the Biden campaign praised in its hiring announcement.</p>
<p>Ms. Harris, a veteran of Mr. Wolf’s first winning campaign, also worked on President Barack Obama’s re-election effort in 2012.</p>
