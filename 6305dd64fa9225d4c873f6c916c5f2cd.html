<h1>Three new COVID-19 deaths in Saturday count</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Daily COVID-19 death totals in Allegheny County and statewide continue to decline.</p>
<p>That continues to represent a hopeful sign, given&nbsp;state preparations to open up 24 mostly rural northern counties on Friday and local hopes that the state shut-in order for Allegheny County will be lifted sometime soon thereafter.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the County Health Department reported three additional deaths, bringing the total county count to 102, with only 14 new COVID-19 infections countywide, for a total to date of 1,333. Both counts include probable and confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Daily case totals have been in general decline since March 30, with total deaths, while showing some dramatic spikes and troughs, also reflecting a declining trend since April 20, according to county data.</p>
<p>Two additional hospitalizations throughout the county have occurred, bringing the Saturday total to 237, with unchanged totals of 99 patients having required ICU care throughout the pandemic and 60 having been placed on mechanical respiration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania State Department of Health announced noon Saturday that there were 1,334 additional positive cases of COVID-19 statewide for a total of 8,305 cases to date. The 64 new deaths have raised the statewide total to 2,418.</p>
<p>“As we see the number of new COVID-19 cases continuously change across the state, that does not mean we can stop practicing social distancing,” Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said in a statement. “We must continue to stay home to protect ourselves, our families and our community.</p>
<p>“If you must go out, please make as few trips as possible and wear a mask to protect not only yourself, but others,” she said.</p>
<p>The department said most patient hospitalizations and deaths continue to involve people aged 65 or older with no pediatric deaths to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long-term care facilities — including nursing and personal care homes — continue to be hot spots for new cases and deaths, with&nbsp;8,827 resident cases of COVID-19, and 1,148 cases among their employees.</p>
<p>That represents a total of 9,975 cases at 478 long-term care facilities in 44 counties.</p>
<p>In addition, the new total of 1,614 deaths of residents in those facilities that include nursing and personal-care homes account for 67% —&nbsp;two-thirds —&nbsp;of the state total number of COVID-19 deaths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, nearly 3,000 of the state’s total number of COVID-19 cases involve health-care workers.</p>
