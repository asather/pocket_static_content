<h1>Port Authority approves one-year labor contract with IBEW</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authorityâ€™s board Friday approved a new, one-year contract with 29 members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.</p>
<p>The contract, which expired in April, includes a 2.5% wage increase but no other changes.</p>
<p>Chief Legal Officer Mike Cetra told a committee last week the agency and the union decided to move ahead with a one-year deal due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused serious revenue problems for the authority due to low ridership and increased cleaning costs.</p>
<p>They hope to do a full contract next year if the health crisis subsides.</p>
