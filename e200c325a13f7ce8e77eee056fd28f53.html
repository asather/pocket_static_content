<h1>Lawsuits allege abuse, name diocese and Holy Family Institute</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Four lawsuits have been filed this month against the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh —&nbsp;two of them also naming Holy Family Institute in Emsworth —&nbsp;by plaintiffs alleging that as minors they were were sexually abused by priests or other employees decades ago.</p>
<p>The lawsuits were filed in Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas and allege, among other things, that the defendants engaged in fraud and conspiracy.</p>
<p>They are the latest in a line of lawsuits based on a legal theory that is now before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in a test case. Abuse claims from long ago would normally be barred under the statute of limitations. But the plaintiffs argue they were victims of a conspiracy of coverup that continued right up to the release of a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/faith-religion/2018/08/14/Pennsylvania-Grand-Jury-report-Catholic-church-priests-Sex-Abuse-attorney-general-Shapiro/stories/201808100153" target="_blank">2018 statewide grand jury report into sexual abuse in Pittsburgh’s and five other dioceses</a>. The plaintiffs allege this brings the cause of action to within the statute of limitations.</p>
<p>Claims made in a lawsuit give one side of a case. The defendants have not yet filed initial responses in these cases.</p>
<p>The two lawsuits naming Holy Family, filed separately by a Pennsylvania woman and man, allege the plaintiffs were sexually abused by multiple perpetrators while they were growing up at Holy Family Institute more than 35 years ago.</p>
<p>They allege the diocese and leaders of the institute failed in their duty to protect the children in their charge and “failed to prevent foreseeable misconduct and/or sexual abuse.”</p>
<p>In one lawsuit, a Pennsylvania woman using the pseudonym Jane Doe alleges she was abused by a teacher and a priest.</p>
<p>The plaintiff alleges she and at least one other student eventually reported their alleged abuse to their public-school principal, who informed the institute, which the plaintiff alleges did nothing about it.</p>
<p>“We deny the allegations of any liability, but we will be investigating the allegations,” said Clem Trischler, attorney for Holy Family Institute. He said he would be responding directly to the allegations through the legal process.</p>
<p>Ellen Mady, chancellor for the Diocese of Pittsburgh, said the diocese doesn’t comment on pending litigation as a matter of policy.</p>
<p>In another lawsuit, a State College man alleges he was sexually abused by priests and others while he was growing up in a group home at Holy Family from 1975 to 1984, from ages 9 to 18.</p>
<p>The plaintiff, Manuel Ramon Cienfuegos, alleges he was first abused by a counselor at the institute and then by a priest and another employee who was or later became a priest. He also alleges sexual misconduct by yet another priest and a lay worker.</p>
<p>A third lawsuit, filed by Kevin A. Dixon, a Pennsylvania resident, names the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Bishop David Zubik and St. Philip Catholic Church of Crafton as defendants.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Mr. Dixon alleges he was sexually abused by a priest at St. Philip on at least four occasions in 1994.</span></p>
<p>And a fourth lawsuit against the diocese, filed Wednesday by New Hampshire resident Giovanni Perfetto, alleges abuse by a now-deceased priest at St. Colman Parish in Turtle Creek in the 1960s and then by two other priests who visited him when he was in Woodville State Hospital and New Castle Youth Development Center.</p>
<p>The lawsuit says the diocese has not answered requests for help in identifying priests assigned to these institutions at that time, and the lawsuit names the priests as defendants, John Doe One and John Doe Two. In addition to them and the diocese, the lawsuit also names as defendants&nbsp;Bishop Zubik and his predecessor, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.</p>
<p>Ms. Mady said that diocesan lawyers are examining this latest lawsuit. She said while the diocese has records of which priests were officially assigned as chaplains to institutions, it does not have a record of which priests may have visited an institution from time to time, nor of determining whether they were priests of this diocese or of another jurisdiction.</p>
