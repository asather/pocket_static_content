<h1>Shursave IGA in Bloomfield to reopen as Community Market </h1>

<p>Bloomfield will be keeping a grocery store after all, just under a different name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shursave IGA on Liberty Avenue is expected to close later this month and will reopen under the Community Market banner, according to O’Hara-based Echo Realty, which <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2020/02/07/Bloomfield-Shursave-grocery-sold-Echo-Realty-5-78-million-redevelopment/stories/202002070129" target="_blank">bought the property&nbsp;in January</a> for a sale price of $5.78 million.</p>
<p>“Echo Realty is aware of the value and need of a grocery store in the Bloomfield neighborhood,” the firm said in a press release.”&nbsp;Giant Eagle, the grocery chain that also is affiliated with Echo, will act as the interim operator of the store.</p>
<p>“The plan is for the Community Market to serve Bloomfield residents until Echo Realty’s long-&nbsp; term site redevelopment plans are realized. During this time, Echo Realty will also begin the&nbsp;dialogue with community leaders regarding those future plans for the property,” the firm said.</p>
<p>It has been a couple years since one plan to redevelop the Bloomfield Shursave IGA had fallen through.&nbsp;Indianapolis-based Milhaus proposed turning the site into a 200-plus unit apartment complex in 2018, but the plans never materialized.</p>
<p>Echo Realty has&nbsp;over 230 properties totaling more than 9 million square feet along the East Coast and Midwest.</p>
