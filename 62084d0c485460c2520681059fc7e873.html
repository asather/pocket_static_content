<h1>Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits sales continue to grow</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board stores are continuing to ramp up sales of wine and spirits, even though all of them remain closed to customers due to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At stores offering phone orders and curbside pickup, the purchase limit is now 12 bottles, up from six.</p>
<p>And this week, all but four retail stores across the state — closed to customers since mid-March&nbsp;—&nbsp;will be offering curbside pickup, as the PLCB adds 14 more. Those include stores in Russellton, Allegheny County; Conemaugh, Cambria County; Knox, Clarion County; Curwensville, Clearfield County; and Latrobe, Monessen, Irwin and Avonmore, Westmoreland County. That brings the total to 580 stores offering curbside pickup Monday through Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sales figures continue to trend upwards for curbside sales. After that service was widely expanded last week, sales rose from&nbsp;66,959 orders for $6.42 million April 20-25 to 233,930 orders for $17.2 million April 27-May 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sales on the <a href="http://www.finewineandgoodspirits.com" target="_blank">www.finewineandgoodspirits.com</a>&nbsp;online store dipped slightly from 45,979 orders for $4.39 million&nbsp;April 15-21 to&nbsp;38,048 orders for $3.65 million&nbsp;April 22–28.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PLCB says it will provide details this week about&nbsp;store operations in two dozen northwest and north-central&nbsp;counties moving from red to yellow status on Friday per Gov. Tom Wolf’s reopening plan. The plan, detailed this past Friday, did not address state Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits stores specifically, but said in-person retail in general is “allowable” while curbside and delivery are “preferable.” The administration is to provide more specifics this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per that reopening plan, the PLCB has resumed sales to some licensees such as bars and restaurants,&nbsp;which may need to&nbsp;order online and have limited access to stores and service centers. Bars and restaurants in yellow-designated counties still are limited to sales to-go.&nbsp;</p>
