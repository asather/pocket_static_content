<h1>Anglers and bass don’t see eye to eye on lure colors</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Winter lingered this year with a series of unseasonable cold spells. As late as early May, anglers were still breaking ice out of rod guides, and many species hesitated at the verge of spawning, waiting for water temperatures to rise to comfort levels.</p>
<p>In rivers and lakes throughout Western Pennsylvania, smallmouth and largemouth bass have left thermally stable deep waters, dropped their eggs and milt and moved to shallower summer feeding waters. The key to hookups is no longer finding literal hot spots where the fish feel warm; it’s an understanding of what bass can see.</p>
<p>Scent, taste, sound vibrations and strike reflex are certainly important senses for smallmouth, largemouth and spotted bass. But as members of the extended panfish family, they have big eyes and are primarily sight feeders. They can see long distances in clear water. In darker waters, not so much.</p>
<p>“The weather has been mostly great and the river is clear,” said Darryl Slemick, who pulled six smallmouths out of the Kiskiminetas River on Tuesday evening. “All afternoon I was using white and chartreuse soft plastics and I got nothing. Around suppertime I put on a green floating-sinking crankbait. Boom, boom, boom! I got strikes on almost every cast.”</p>
<p>It is a long-held angler’s rule of thumb to choose light-colored lures for bright days and clear water, and dark colors for low light and cloudy water. Science confirms that conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>In the late 1930s, a behavioral study of largemouth bass color perception was published in the Illinois Natural History Survey Bulletin. Bass were given food rewards for correctly responding to targets of various colors including red, yellow, green, blue, black and others.&nbsp;Considered a scientific breakthrough at the time, the study showed that bass have the ability to distinguish between red and green, with darker colors appearing as a dark mono-color blur.</p>
<p>Since that initial research, a variety of studies have explored the biological structure of fish eyes.</p>
<p>“The way one animal perceives a scene is different [from] another species, and this is particularly so for fish,” stated a study of color sensitivity in largemouth bass published in 2018.</p>
<p>The study counted and evaluated the sensitivity of photo-receptors in bass eyes, used that data to model visual perception and tested the model through behavioral research. Researchers found that bass eyes have two types of cone cells —&nbsp;one that responds to green and another that perceives only red. Rod cells determine light and dark perception. Because of the structure of their eyes, bass are not able to discern between chartreuse yellow and white nor between green and blue. Bass can, however, distinguish red from grayscale tones. To a bass, the aquatic world looks bright or dark, green or red.</p>
<p>The biology is complicated by the physics of light penetration in water. In the near-vacuum of space, light travels at 186,282 miles per second. In the air surrounding Earth, it loses about 56 miles per second. In denser material such as water, light is further slowed as some wavelengths are absorbed —&nbsp;they disappear — while other wavelengths change direction through the process of refraction. As light travels deeper into the water, additional wavelengths are absorbed. The longest wavelengths with the least energy, those in the red spectrum, are the first to disappear completely. Wavelengths seen as orange are next, followed by yellow, green, blue and purple.</p>
<p>Water clarity further impacts bass color perception. Algae and degrees of cloudiness darken the colors bass see in the same way that levels of darkness impact their visual acuity. When all the fish seem to want the same color of lure, it may be because it’s the only color they can see.</p>
<p>By comparison, humans have three types of cone cells responsive to red, green or blue and can perceive many colors in between. Looking over the side of the boat, we see light change its direction as it enters the water, gradually grow darker and finally disappear. Looking into the tackle box, we see sight-perception lures in colors that bass can’t see.</p>
<p>How does all of that translate into lure selection? The rule of thumb stands. In bright light and clear water, go for bright, light-colored lures. Tie on darker colors as the sky and water darken. Bi-colored lures in contrasting colors may offer an advantage.</p>
<p>At the end of a sunny day, as the sky begins to darken over slightly cloudy water, which lure should you choose? Experience counts. That’s why they call it fishing.</p>
