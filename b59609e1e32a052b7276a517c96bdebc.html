<h1>How Le'Veon Bell and the Steelers jump-started recent NFL postseason trend</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Le’Veon Bell had back-to-back 100-yard rushing games against the Miami Dolphins and Kansas City Chiefs in the 2016 postseason, it appeared to signal a change in offensive emphasis for NFL playoff teams.</p>
<p>Even though teams were operating in the most prolific passing era in league history, the offensive mindset suddenly switched to running the ball in order to survive in the postseason.</p>
<p>Bell had two of the four 100-yard rushing games in the first two rounds in 2016 — 167 against the Dolphins, 170 against the Chiefs, a two-game NFL record for a first-time playoff performer. That number grew to six in 2018 when there were actually more 100-yard rushing games (7) than 300-yard passing games (5) in the entire postseason.</p>
<p>And it could grow even more when five of the top six rushing teams from the 2019 regular season are among the eight teams who will play this weekend in the divisional round of the NFL postseason. That will be especially highlighted when the Tennessee Titans, who have the league’s rushing leader, Derrick Henry, and the Baltimore Ravens, the NFL’s No. 1 rushing offense with two 1,000-yard runners, play Saturday night at M&amp;T Bank Stadium.</p>
<p>Since the start of the past decade, there have been 57 300-yard passers and 40 100-yard rushers in the postseason — an indication teams lean more on the run once the regular-season ends.</p>
<p>The Steelers once had that formula with Bell. In tandem with Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown, they formed one of the most dangerous offenses in the league. After having a rushing leader with fewer than 500 yards for the first time in 53 years, it’s time to go recapture that formula, if at all possible.</p>
<p>The Ravens became the first team in league history to average more than 200 yards rushing and passing in a regular season because of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who threw an NFL-best 36 touchdowns and broke Mike Vick’s single-season record for rushing yards by a quarterback with 1,206.</p>
<p>When running back Mark Ingram also ran for 1,018 yards, the Ravens became the first team since the Carolina Panthers in 2009 (Jonathan Stewart, DeAngelo Williams) to have two 1,000-yard rushers in the same season.</p>
<p>In a conference call with reporters this week, Titans coach Mike Vrabel said he is not sure how to defend Jackson “other than try to tie his shoelaces together.”</p>
<p>All Henry has done for the Titans is rush for 393 yards in his past two games, including 182 in last week’s wild-card victory in New England against the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots. It was the most rushing yards in a playoff game since 2008, and his 34 carries were the most by a player in 2019.</p>
<p>Henry was the only 100-yard rusher during the wild-card round, but if recent history is any indication, that number could grow on Saturday and Sunday. Especially because of the teams involved.</p>
<p>The league’s top four rushing teams — Ravens (206 average), San Francisco 49ers (144.1), Titans (138.9) and Seattle Seahawks (137.5) — are still alive. So are the Minnesota Vikings (133.3), who finished sixth in rush offense.</p>
<p>Curiously, though, teams start to rely less on the run and more on the pass once they get past the divisional round.</p>
<p>Since 2015, there has been only one 100-yard rusher once the playoff field is reduced to four teams — New England’s Sony Michel (113), who did it last season against the Kansas City Chiefs. In that same time period, there have been 10 300-yard passers once teams get past the divisional round.</p>
<p>The last time there were multiple 100-yard rushers in the championship round and Super Bowl was 2014 when Seattle’s Marshawn Lynch did it in both games and New England’s LeGarrette Blount had more than 100 yards in the AFC championship.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, since 2010, the number of 100-yard rushing games dropped from 124 to 84 in 2017 in the regular season. In that same general period, 300-yard passing games rose from 96 in 2010 to 142 in 2018.</p>
<p>But the disparity has shrunk since then. There were 109 100-yard rushing games this season, 25 more than 2017. Conversely, there were 132 300-yard passing games in 2019, 10 fewer than the previous season.</p>
<p>The postseason has a chance to continue that trend.</p>
