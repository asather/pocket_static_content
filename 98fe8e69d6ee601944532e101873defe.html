<h1>Pirates announcers to call games remotely in 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pirates broadcasters will work remotely if there is baseball in 2020, a source told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Thursday.</p>
<p>It’ll be the same around the league, too, as Major League Baseball teams look to reduce foot traffic on-site amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>This means Greg Brown, Joe Block, Bob Walk, John Wehner and potentially others will work from AT&amp;T SportsNet’s North Shore studio, as well as 93.7 The Fan’s headquarters in Green Tree.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T SportsNet recently debuted its new digs, which should certainly enhance the broadcast.</p>
<p>Calling games off monitors is something ESPN has utilized when broadcasting Korea Baseball Organization games, with Karl Ravech, Eduardo Perez and others calling games from TV.</p>
<p>The Pirates this offseason contemplated <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/13/Pittsburgh-Pirates-to-use-several-former-players-to-fill-Steve-Blass-former-role/stories/202001130089" target="_blank">using additional color commentators</a> such as Michael McKenry, Matt Capps and Kevin Young in the wake of Steve Blass’ retirement last season. Their status is still to be determined, as it hinges on the number of games.&nbsp;McKenry, however, will continue in his current role as a pre- and post-game analyst.</p>
