<h1>Pitt has hopes of ending season on a positive note in the ACC tournament</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Many of Pitt’s players, coaches and staff members had left the McCamish Pavilion locker room Wednesday, off to begin their journey into the night that would ultimately bring them back to Western Pennsylvania at an ungodly hour.</p>
<p>Outside that locker room, Eric Hamilton remained. His team was wrecked by Georgia Tech that night, losing by 16, but Hamilton played well, scoring 12 points and pulling down nine rebounds. Now, he was left to explain not only how the Panthers’ seventh-consecutive loss unfolded, but where he and his teammates were mentally after that series of setbacks.</p>
<p>His intensity was palpable, both in his face and voice.</p>
<p>“For me, I just want to get a win,” he said. “That’s it. That’s the only thing I’m focusing on, man. The season is starting to come down to the last several games. The most important thing is just showing up and doing whatever you can to help the team win. If you’re not thinking about helping the team win or doing whatever it is coach asks as far as the game plan, you’re just effed up in the head, man. For me, that’s what I’m thinking about. That’s what we’re thinking about, and that’s what we should be thinking about.”</p>
<p>Over the past several days, Hamilton and Pitt’s other players have had time to think about their situation and how they ended up here before the start of the ACC tournament, which begins for them Tuesday with an opening-day game against Wake Forest in Greensboro, N.C.</p>
<p>The Panthers, at this late point in its season, are like Tulsi Gabbard in the Democratic presidential primary: yes, their dreams — a berth in the NCAA tournament, not a spot in the Oval Office — are still <em>technically</em> alive, but no sane person genuinely believes they will come to fruition. At 15-16, to even be in position to have valid National Invitation Tournament aspirations, they would have to make the tournament’s semifinals to finish the season above .500, and even that outlandish scenario would require a team with no wins in the past 30 days to notch three victories in three days.</p>
<p>It’s overwhelmingly likely Pitt’s season will be over in the next three days. In the absence of favorable odds, players like Hamilton cling to belief.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen things happen,” Hamilton said. “We’re on a seven-game losing streak. Who knows? We might turn it around in our next game and go on a streak and win two or three. I’m not sitting here going ‘Aw, man, the season’s over. The season’s over.’ I’m not hanging my head. I’ve seen teams go into postseason, as far as their conference tournament, do crappy and then turn it around and get on a hot streak and win out and make postseason play. The window’s open for me. I’m going to tell my teammates that, as well.”</p>
<p>In the Demon Deacons, the Panthers will face an opponent they lost to in their only previous meeting this season, a 69-65 setback in a game Pitt led by as many as 16. Wake Forest, the tournament’s No. 12 seed (Pitt is the No. 13 seed), has talent with the likes of Brandon Childress, Olivier Sarr and Chaundee Brown, all of whom average more than 12 points per game, and has been playing better of late, going 3-4 in its past seven games after starting ACC play 3-10. It’s also dealing with an amount of uncertainty, though, with sixth-year head coach Danny Manning, who has gone 35-57 the past three seasons, facing growing speculation about his job security.</p>
<p>Should the Panthers win their first game, they would play the next afternoon against an N.C. State squad that beat them by four, 77-73, not even two weeks ago. The winner of that matchup would advance to play Duke.</p>
<p>If there’s some measure of hope to be had for a team that hasn’t inspired much of it, if any, the past month, it’s in the relative weakness of the ACC. The conference isn’t the gauntlet it has been in previous seasons. It is rated by KenPom.com as the fifth-best league in the country this season. If it finishes there, it would mark the first time since the 2012-13 season that it wasn’t ranked among the top three conferences in the sport by KenPom at the end of the Final Four. Additionally, only four of its teams are safely in the NCAA tournament field, which would be the lowest number of bids it received to the event since that same 2012-13 season, when the league only had 12 teams (it has 15 now).</p>
<p>As the season has gone on, though, coaches within the league have publicly bristled at the idea that the conference is down. Pitt’s Jeff Capel, who grew up around the ACC, played in it and now coaches in it, is among those defending it.</p>
<p>“I get upset when I hear people talk about how our league’s not that good,” Capel said Wednesday after the Georgia Tech loss. “What has happened is we don’t have the star power that our league has had. It has also hurt us a little bit that North Carolina is down. But I think from top to bottom, the league is actually maybe a little more competitive than it was last year.”</p>
<p>Whatever inspiration that Pitt can generate within its locker room may come from its success earlier in the season. There have been any number of recent stumbles, to put it generously, but this is also the same team that beat the tournament’s No. 1 seed (Florida State), albeit four months ago, lost by just three to the No. 2 seed (Virginia), took the No. 3 seed (Louisville) to overtime in a game it gave away after leading by seven with three minutes remaining and was within three points of the No. 4 seed (Duke) on the road in the final five minutes.</p>
<p>It’s very possible, perhaps even likely, that those glimpses of competence and success are outliers or products of a different team playing during a far different point in the season. They’ve been through so much losing in the past month, shortcomings that have a cumulative effect, that it’s illogical to say they’re the same team.</p>
<p>But hope isn’t always the most logical thing. And right now, that’s about all Pitt has.</p>
<p>“You’ve just got to look within yourself,” Hamilton said. “If you’re a competitor, you’re a competitor. There ain’t nothing else really to say. If you want to win, you have to do what it takes to win. Whatever it takes. Whatever your job is, just do your job and get it done.”</p>
<p>“I really believe in this team,” Hamilton added later. “I just don’t think we’re done at all.”</p>
