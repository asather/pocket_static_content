<p>Farm Aid will present At Home With Farm Aid on Saturday, featuring Farm Aid board members Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, Neil Young and Dave Matthews performing live from their homes.</p>
<p>The hour-long event will air on AXS-TV at 8 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>Nelson will be joined by his sons Lukas and Micah.The intimate performances will raise funds and awareness for farmers impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>It airs as part of AXS TV's new "@Home And Social" initiative, an ongoing series giving artists a platform to broadcast live performances from their homes and studios, with proceeds supporting those in need as a result of the coronavirus. Viewers can enjoy the simulcast on AXS-TV and at www.farmaid.org, as well as across the Network's various social media platforms.</p>
<p>"The coronavirus has disrupted our entire country and is a grave threat to all of us. One of its many impacts is that it has helped us to better see the value of essential people like healthcare workers, grocery store clerks, delivery truck drivers, and farmers and ranchers," said Farm Aid president Nelson. "Farm Aid has worked for 35 years to build a family farm centered agricultural system, and we are here now to support farmers and ranchers in this crisis, without whom we could not eat. The time to build a resilient family farm food system is now!"</p>
<p>The S&amp;T Bank Music Park in Burgettstown played host to Farm Aid in 2017.&nbsp;</p>
