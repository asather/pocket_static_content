And doing what he does best.</title></head><body><p>Patric Hornqvist planted his skates on the edge of the crease on Thursday night at PPG Paints Arena. Then, he started to grow roots.</p><p>Poor Aaron Dell. When Hornqvist gets to the front of the net like this, it rarely ends well for goalies. And it didn’t for the San Jose Sharks netminder, either.</p><p>Bryan Rust tossed a pass in front. Hornqvist calmly flipped it over Dell’s shoulder, tying the score at 2 late in the second period. It wasn’t enough to get the Penguins the win. They’d <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/01/02/Penguins-Sharks-Patric-Hornqvist-Tristan-Jarry-Bryan-Rust-Alex-Galchenyuk/stories/202001020196" target="_blank">end up losing 3-2</a> when a costly overtime penalty created a 4-on-3 power play for a Sharks team with lethal weapons on the blue line. But that goal, Hornqvist’s second of the night, was enough to secure a point, help Pittsburgh improve to 24-11-5 and keep the team chugging along with so many stars still injured.&nbsp;</p><p>How’s he do it?</p><p>“Keep working hard for it,” Hornqvist said. “I think when you work hard, you get bounces.”</p><p>That quote – and that net-front play – is Patric Hornqvist. Actually, it could practically be his motto.</p><p>Work hard. Get bounces.&nbsp;Take punishment. Talk trash. Instigate. Hit people. Get hit. Play through pain. Stand in front of the net. Grow roots. Do the dirty work. Score goals.</p><p>To some, all this may sound easy, or at least simple. But the truth is, this is a rough way to make a living in the NHL. Yet, Hornqvist has been doing it for 741 career games.</p><p>That number is noteworthy because on Monday, one game earlier, he passed Kim Johnsson for the most games played by a last overall pick in NHL history – the type of achievement befitting of a player like Hornqvist.</p><p>In the NFL, they call the last overall pick “Mr. Irrelevant.” Hornqvist? He’s anything but.&nbsp;He’s a player once underrated and overlooked who won’t let you forget him.</p><p>When he’s standing in front of the net, he is to goalies that annoying pink flamingo in your neighbor’s yard. The gum stuck on the bottom of your shoe. The text message notification that just won’t go away even though, what the heck, all of the text messages are read!</p><p>Even at 33, the player the league – or at least the NHL draft – almost passed up won’t go away without making his presence felt, on the ice and inside the Penguins’ locker room.&nbsp;</p><p>“He’s great for our team,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “His energy is contagious... I don’t think the guy has ever had a bad day in his life. He comes in every day, he’s got a smile on his face and he loves to play hockey. We love that about him.”</p><p>This season, the injury bug that has bitten the Penguins so hard has taken two chunks out of Hornqvist’s season. He missed time from Nov. 3-21, a span of seven games, with a lower-body injury. After returning for just six games, he went back on injured reserve with a lower-body issue and missed the first 10 games of December.</p><p>He returned to the ice on Saturday against Nashville. That’s the same team where Hornqvist spent the first six seasons of his NHL career, going from a last overall pick to a player valuable enough that Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford traded a Pittsburgh fan favorite, James Neal, to get the grimy net-front presence. The trade was gutsy – and it paid off to the tune of back-to-back Stanley Cups.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past two games, Hornqvist has produced a two-point performances in each. He had another classic Hornqvist goal during Monday’s win against Ottawa. While rookie defenseman made the fanciest spin-o-rama in his young career, Hornqvist was once again parked in front of the net, ready to bash home anything that came his way.</p><p>Now, it’s only fair to point out that the first goal Hornqvist scored was a beauty. He took the Sharks to Dangle City off the rush.&nbsp;</p><p>But right now, the Penguins need goals anyway they can get them at this point. With Sidney Crosby still inching toward his return and All-Star winger Jake Guentzel likely done for the season, the club is without two of its fancier goal scorers. So for now — and, actually, for as long as the 33-year-old wants to keep putting his body on the line in front of the net —&nbsp;they’ll take the grimy ones, too.</p><p>“He’s one of the most competitive guys that I’ve been around,” Sullivan said. “He means a lot to this team, both on the ice and off the ice.”</p><p><em>Mike DeFabo: <a href="mailto:mdefabo@post-gazette.com" target="_blank">mdefabo@post-gazette.com</a>&nbsp;and Twitter @MikeDeFabo.&nbsp;</em></p></body></html>
