<h1>CMU joins legal fight to overturn new international student rules</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University says it is filing an amicus brief supporting a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/07/08/Harvard-MIT-lawsuit-Trump-administration-immigration-order-foreign-students-universities-online/stories/202007080092" target="_blank">lawsuit by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> to block <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/07/06/ICE-immigration-rules-changed-international-students-online-classes-deported-transfer-Harvard-Donald-Trump/stories/202007060119" target="_blank">new federal rules</a> that could force international students to leave the U.S if their instruction goes entirely online this fall.</p>
<p>In doing so, CMU joins other institutions filing amicus briefs, among them Penn State University, the University of Pennsylvania and both Cornell and Princeton universities.</p>
<p>"Forcing any international student who is in the United States legally to transfer or leave the country at this unprecedented time is profoundly misguided and painfully cruel," CMU President Farnam Jahanian told the campus in an email Thursday informing them of the school's plan. "Furthermore, these and other rash, anti-immigration actions threaten to erode the very foundation of the American university system and its powerful and positive impact on economic prosperity and our national security."</p>
<p>Mr. Jahanian said a number of institutions and higher education organizations are working collectively to oppose the policy change announced Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>"...We are exploring other legal and policy options, as well as other university actions, to mitigate the potential impact of these guidelines,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>Officials at Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh and their counterparts at schools nationwide have warned the policy is a potentially devastating body blow to colleges and universities, many already reeling from financial impacts of the pandemic and recession, plus uncertainty about fall enrollment.</p>
<p>More than 1 million international students study and do research in the U.S. The stakes for Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh are particularly high. This state is the sixth leading host state with 51,818 students, and CMU, Pitt and Penn State by themselves have more than 20,000 foreign students, according to a November report by the Institute of International Education in New York City.</p>

<p>The policy change would bar students from entering the U.S. for online-only instruction. If their campus begins the fall with in-person classes but switches to remote learning amid a spike in the virus, those students and their schools would have to either demonstrate they are receiving at least some in-person instruction, transfer to another school or face removal proceedings, officials said.</p>
<p>Harvard and MIT brought their lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security and ICE about a day after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/07/06/ICE-immigration-rules-changed-international-students-online-classes-deported-transfer-Harvard-Donald-Trump/stories/202007060119" target="_blank">the policy was announced</a>.</p>
