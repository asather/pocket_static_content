<h1>DA's office will not prosecute 39 arrested in connection to Pittsburgh protests</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Criminal charges filed by Pittsburgh police against 39 people in connection to protests over the past week will be withdrawn by Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr., DA spokesman Mike Manko said on Monday.</p>
<p>Forty-six people were charged with failure to disperse and disorderly conduct on May 30 after a protest over the death of George Floyd and police brutality turned violent. Police arrested an additional 20 people on June 1 after a protest in East Liberty.</p>
<p>“We do not have the evidence in these cases to suitably conduct a preliminary hearing,” Mr. Manko said in a statement. “Until the Public Safety director provides evidence that is both relevant and substantial, it is inappropriate to proceed with these criminal complaints.”</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto, who directed the Pittsburgh police department to file criminal complaints against the protesters according to Mr. Manko’s statement, declined to comment.</p>
<p>The district attorney’s office did not specify which protesters had their charges withdrawn.</p>
<p>Protests have been held in Pittsburgh and the surrounding area every day since May 30. All, except for protests on May 30 and June 1, ended peacefully.</p>
