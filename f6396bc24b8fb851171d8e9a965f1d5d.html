<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 06.24.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hello everyone. Thanks for joining my weekly Pirates chat. Looks like we actually have a decent amount to talk about here. So, ask away. Don't be shy. I'll be back at noon to answer all of your questions. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: And away we go ... a couple minutes early.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Hi Jason. When will the schedule be released? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I believe it was supposed to come out within 72 hours of the "agreement" yesterday on health and safety protocols. I don't think it's going to take that long.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: I'm an eternal pessimist and look at the potential starting rotation and think this team can't win more than 20 games. And quite frankly, I'm not certain the ceiling for wins isn't closer to 15. Do you think the starting pitching is going to be as bad as I think? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: No, GSMP, I don't. And here's why: This group isn't as bad as they performed last year. A big reason was preparedness. The Pirates lacked. They were too old school, to the point of being archaic. They were also stubborn. They did not adjust their pitching philosophy well enough. Third, they did a lousy job of incorporating technology. Joe Musgrove told me in spring training that they had the equipment, but nobody -- mainly the coaches -- knew what to do with it or how to translate the data into anything meaningful for the pitchers. It's all bad. But that's why I think they'll be better in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Are the owners receiving a pro rata share of TV dollars both nationally and locally? I'm just curious if the Pirates are going to have a huge profit this year with such a low payroll to begin with and only having to pay about 37% of it. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I'm not prepared to do a deep dive on the Pirates finances right now, comparing their adjusted revenue to the payroll, etc. But loose understanding is that, no, they would not stand to make money hand over fist. And this is not coming from them. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: The Pirates, the same as other teams, will lack at least 40% of revenue because of no fans while still paying a pretty decent amount of overhead.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Hi Jason-- Baseball is on the horizon-- finally. Two questions, one do you plan to do a roster prediction as the season start approaches? Two, do you think with only 60 games and no minor league season, that they should put an emphasis on younger players like Hayes, Tucker, Craig, etc. getting valuable playing time? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Bill. Thank you for the question. And I'm sorry for the delay. I was trying to listen to Derek Shelton on the Fan and do this, and I wasn't doing a very good job of that. Anyway ... yes, I will likely do a roster projection. I believe I did one a week or two ago in this space. And, to your question, to a point. They shouldn't if it's going to hamper development. But I also think they were going to have Hayes up here anyway this season, so why not just do it now? I think that's what they need to make sure of -- if he's going to be OK with this big club. His defense is certainly good enough. They need to make sure on the bat. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Here would be my 30-man roster, BTW: Lineup: Newman, Reynolds, Frazier, Bell, Polanco, Moran, Dyson, Stallings, Hayes. ... Rotation: Musgrove, Williams, Keller, Holland, Brault. ... Bullpen: Kela, Crick, Rodriguez, Feliz, Burdi, Santana, Erlin, Stratton. ... Bench: Riddle, Osuna, Gonzalez, Heredia, Maile. ... Extra: Kuhl, Holmes, Tucker and Evans or Murphy. Hopefully I didn't forget anyone.</p>
<p><strong>OHIO412FAN</strong>: Will Steven Brault or Chad Kuhl take the final rotational spot? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I see that going to Brault, with Kuhl maybe used as a bulk guy -- or long relief.</p>
<p><strong>OHIO412FAN</strong>: Hello, Jason. Truly enjoy your chats and articles! Thanks for all that you do in a rather dying industry that is journalism. You’re an amazing writer! Anyway, I wanted to get your thoughts on the Pirates this upcoming season. Will they be as bad as everyone thinks they will be, or maybe not? I’m loving their stockpiling of the farms lately, they have several MLB ready players coming up about to start in the lineup soon. While the short term is bleak, I remain optimistic they will turn things around if they continue to build around the Farm and young core. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thank you very much for that. I think they're going to be much better than expected. There's a decent amount of talent here, but they lack depth. A 60-game season sorta masks that. I'm not saying they're going to go 40-20, but I also don't see them going 20-40. I think they'll flirt with .500 over 60 games and maybe even a playoff spot. I think they will be respectable.</p>
<p><strong>OHIO412FAN</strong>: I read an article from Rum Bunter explaining how Nick Burdi could be groomed as the next Closer, If not 1b aside from Keone Kela. Do you think they have a solid bullpen without the unforeseen Vasquez? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think it could be a sneaky good part of the team, yes. And I see why someone would think that. Burdi, if healthy, is incredible. But the health worries me. I hope he's able to prove this season that he's able to stay healthy for any stretch of time.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: I saw the freeze ends Friday. That should be the day Yasiel puig is a Pirate. I’m glad to see Andrew Fillipponi agrees with me. He knows that he would be a great addition for us <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: There you go, Ricky. Look at what you started. I hope they remember that when the Pirates plan the victory parade.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: Will cederlind make the team? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hmm ... that's a good one. I may need to rethink my 30-man for that reason, because the same logic I'm applying to Hayes, I should apply to Cederlind. I think he's very close. It wouldn't surprise me at all if he did.</p>
<p><strong>Too Tall 21</strong>: Hi Jason. So I guess that outside TV on my roof-top deck that I had installed to watch the Pirates this year is finally going to get used for something other than the YouTube Grateful Dead shows I’ve been streaming! Long, strange trip, indeed! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: That's great to hear!</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: Who is the strongest guy on the pirates? Polanco? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It would be either Polanco or Bell, I would think. Depends on what lift we're talking about, but I also wouldn't discount Joe Musgrove.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: Any indication on how transactions will work with the taxi squad? Be paid on a daily rate, but based on 60-game prorated salary? Players will need options remaining to go up and down if on the 40? How many days not active will be needed to burn an option? Be paid their minor league rate while not active? Need to have contract selected if not on the 40? DFA someone to make room? Outright that player to the taxi squad if not lost to waivers? How do you replace that player if they are lost on waivers? SO MANY QUESTIONS!?!? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You. Are. Down. In. The. Weeds. I'll be honest, Sam: I've worked back-to-back 14-hour days, then was back at it this morning. With other stories I'm working on, trying to be even remotely present as a dad, I haven't had a chance to comb through everything to that degree. ... I believe taxi squad guys will be paid a minor league rate. For options, I don't see how they're going "up and down" if they're on the taxi squad; there's no minor league team to go down to. ... But again, MLB has communicated zero details on the minutiae here to us. I think we're just going to have to learn it with a little more time.</p>
<p><strong>Too Tall 21</strong>: My question - do you think a small number of fans will be allowed to attend any of the games, as NASCAR did at Talledega? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: No, I don't think so. From what I understand, I would be prepared for no fans the rest of the season, especially with what has happened recently around the country.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: How are rookies going to be attributed service? The agreement says to scale the service ((days * 186) / 66), but I've seen reported that won't be the case for rookies; rather, they'd only receive the days they are active. This is mostly important for Hayes, as he could be up all 66 days and only get .066 days of service, and not 1.000. But, would Keller or Tucker--who are rookie eligible--be in the same boat? SO MANY QUESTIONS!?!? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Again, this sort of stuff has not been communicated. People in front offices are not yet clear. Patience, my man, patience.</p>
<p><strong>Mark C</strong>: I just want to say, it is good to see some actual baseball talk in here! I'm pretty fired up <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I agree, Mark. Thrilled to talk about anything other than the bickering back and forth, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: Is media going to be at the pirates practices? When will the first official practice be <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They report for spring training 2.0 on July 1. First workout will be July 3. It's still up in the air what the media/access procedures will be. Hopefully we know something soon.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: oddsmakers put pirates over/under at 25 1/2 games what would you say <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Mark. I saw that. Actually tweeted out a question to that effect. I would take the over. I think the Pirates are going to be better than many expect.</p>
<p><strong>Too Tall 21</strong>: I am so looking forward to the first time this year I will be able to yell out my four favorite words - “Raise the Jolly Roger!!” <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Ha. I'm just looking forward to baseball being back. It's nice to be able to slide back into something of a routine and to be done with this whole back-and-forth junk. Definitely has not been my favorite time on this beat.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: The restriction of number of pitchers on the roster has been lifted, which would have been 13 out of 26; any idea where the Pirates may lean as far as number of pitchers available? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Awesome, Sam. A question of yours I'm able to answer. I'm sorry for not having more on the minutiae, but you'd be surprised how slow information on those topics moves. ... Anyway, I would expect them to keep at least two extra pitchers. I think they could maybe go with three, but someone -- maybe Cederlind -- would have to force them into that decision by how well he pitches in spring. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I'm sorry to do this folks, but Derek Shelton is talking to us at 1 and I need to hop on this Zoom call. Promise we will do more next week. Thanks so much for participating!</p>
