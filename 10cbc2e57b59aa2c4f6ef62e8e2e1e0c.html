<h1>Conduct board responds to Judge Tranquilli, says he should remain suspended without pay</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A suspended Allegheny County Common Pleas judge should not be paid while removed from the bench, the state Judicial Conduct Board argued Friday.</p>
<p>The Court of Judicial Discipline suspended Judge Mark V. Tranquilli <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/08/26/Pittsburgh-Allegheny-County-Court-Common-Pleas-Judge-Mark-Tranquilli-suspended-without-pay-racist-statements/stories/202008260143" target="_blank">without pay</a>&nbsp;last month, following charges stemming a number of misconduct allegations, including that he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/03/08/Allegations-of-racism-put-Judge-Mark-V-Tranquilli-under-scrutiny/stories/202003040183" target="_blank">referred to a juror as “Aunt Jemima.”</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week, the judge filed a petition asking the court to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/08/26/Pittsburgh-Allegheny-County-Court-Common-Pleas-Judge-Mark-Tranquilli-suspended-without-pay-racist-statements/stories/202008260143" target="_blank">reverse that decision</a> because, he argued, it was made without due process.&nbsp;He also asked for an evidentiary hearing and an oral argument before the court.&nbsp;The Judicial Conduct Board, which filed the charges against Judge Tranquilli, on Friday asked the court to deny his request.</p>
<p>The board originally asked the court to suspend Judge Tranquilli based on the complaint they filed against the judge, which alleged Judge Tranquilli&nbsp;“mocked and harassed litigants before their lawyers,” referred to a juror with a racist epithet and&nbsp;“stereotyping language.” They also said he&nbsp;“belittled, demeaned and threatened” criminal defendants appearing before him at a sentencing hearing with inappropriate language.</p>
<p>The allegations mean the court should continue the suspension without pay while the allegations are explored, the board argued.</p>
<p>When the judge, while speaking to a prosecutor and a defense attorney after a trial, reference to one juror as a&nbsp;“knucklehead” and another as&nbsp;“Aunt Jemima,” he violated multiple judicial canon provisions, including “his duty to promote public confidence in the judiciary” and his duty&nbsp;“to be patient, dignified and courteous” to people whom he deals with in an official manner, the board said.</p>
<p>They pointed towards the 2016 case of Pennsylvania Supreme Court&nbsp;Justice J. Michael Eakin, who stepped down after a scandal in which he <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2016/03/15/Justice-Eakin-to-to-resign-over-porn-email-scandal/stories/201603150158" target="_blank">sent&nbsp;and received offensive emails</a> containing pornographic images and racist jokes.</p>
<p>“If racially-biased&nbsp;‘humor’ emails sent privately between a judge and his friends constitute acts that stain a judge’s integrity to the point that it could cause citizens to wonder whether their cases received unbiased consideration by that judge,” the board wrote, “then it is with greater force that Judge Tranquilli’s acts... cry out for the swift action of suspension.”</p>
<p>The board said Judge Tranquilli’s use of ebonics during a custody trial, in which he told a Black couple how they should communicate, allegedly saying, “...I don’t mean, ‘and den da bitch done dis, and den da bitch done dat,’” was the type of&nbsp;“impatient, undignified, rude and discourteous” behavior that has led to sanctions for other judicial officers.</p>
<p>The court&nbsp;“is left with a judge who manifests bias and prejudice in his officials duties” and “who believes that, despite these facts, he is entitled to maintain his pay as if he did none of these things,” the board said.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli argued to the court that his suspension “deviated starkly” from other actions the court had taken in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>In the conduct board’s opinion, that only reflected the&nbsp;“outrageousness of Judge Tranquilli’s conduct as charged” and the court has never had a factual scenario like the case at hand.</p>
<p>The board refuted the judge’s claim that the integrity of the judiciary was safe after the county’s president judge assigned to administrative duties, saying that only the Court of Judicial Discipline or the Supreme Court could have the power to suspend judicial officers.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli’s conduct&nbsp;“can best be described as the prototypical bully,” the board wrote. When rebuked for his behavior,&nbsp;“he retreated to fanciful excuses and self-victimization as his defense.”</p>
<p>The judge’s case will be tried at the Court of Judicial Discipline on Oct. 5.</p>
