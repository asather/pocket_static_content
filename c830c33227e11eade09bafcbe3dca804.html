<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Sheriff’s office announced Wednesday night that a woman has been arrested after she was wanted for abducting a child from Illinois last month.</p>
<p>According to Chief Deputy Kevin Kraus, the county sheriff’s deputies found Lilandra Redman, 20, of Rochester, Pa., at a home in the 2900 block of Versailles Street in McKeesport around 6 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Kraus said police in McHenry, Ill., charged Ms. Redman on Aug. 19, accusing her of abducting a child from Woodstock, Ill. According to Mr. Kraus, Ms. Redman met the 15-year-old boy online and had been in contact with him for a few years.</p>
<p>“The two would use social media and apps to converse, as well as a disposable phone which Redman got to the victim via another student,” Mr. Kraus said in a press release.</p>
<p>In the early hours on Aug. 3, police say Ms. Redman traveled in an Uber to the child’s home in Illinois. Police say the child left his parents a note stating he traveled to New York City with a woman named Jessica. The child also reset his phone and left it in Illinois, according to police.</p>
<p>The two then traveled to Pennsylvania in a plane, according to police. Authorities located the victim Aug. 3 at Ms. Redman’s address in Beaver County. Police say Ms. Redman was not at the address at the time.</p>
<p>“Police have been searching for Redman since to no avail,” Mr. Kraus said. Recently, county sheriff’s deputies began to search for her, and arrested her without incident on Wednesday at a home in McKeesport.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Kraus, Ms. Redman has been transported to Allegheny County Jail where she will await extradition to Illinois. Mr. Kraus said Ms. Redman has also been charged with fugitive from justice.</p>
