<h1>Inspecting the inspectors: State agency wasted $160,000 on guns it can’t use</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Oh, the irony.</p>
<p>The state agency that is supposed to be a watchdog on government spending wasted some $160,000 of taxpayers’ money on guns and ammo for its inspectors — who aren’t permitted to carry weapons. And for reasons that no one can seem to explain, that equipment has been locked in storage for nearly two years.</p>
<p>The state inspector general’s office purchased 145 pistols, ammunition and auxiliary equipment after a law was passed in 2017 that gave the office the authority to issue subpoenas and search warrants. The intent was to provide the office’s inspectors with the weapons to carry in the performance of their new duties.</p>
<p>After the purchases were made, however, the administration determined the new law did not allow for arming the inspectors. So instead of returning the weapons — or selling them or making them available to another law enforcement agency — the guns and ammo have been locked away since they were delivered in April 2018.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s bad enough that the purchase was made without first checking the legality of arming inspectors, but to take no action to correct the mistake for nearly two years is completely irresponsible for an agency charged with exposing waste and misconduct in state programs.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the office has since said they are working with the state general services department to “return or repurpose the firearms,” but a skeptic might ask if that decision came about only because the $160,000 wasted purchase came to light.</p>
<p>The office’s most-recent annual report made no mention of the weapons, and the online portal to access state contracts likewise shows no record of the purchase.</p>
<p>It could be that the inspector general’s office held on to the guns in the hope that the law would be amended to allow investigators to carry weapons. There seems little support for such a move. A spokesman for Gov. Tom Wolf’s office said the current law is “sufficient” for inspectors to perform their duties.</p>
<p>Regardless, it’s no excuse for keeping taxpayers in the dark about the purchase and simply putting the weapons in storage for nearly two years.</p>
<p>The guns, ammo and equipment should be returned to the general services department immediately and either sold or reassigned to other law-enforcement agencies. In the meantime, the inspector general’s office has some serious work ahead in rebuilding public trust.</p>
