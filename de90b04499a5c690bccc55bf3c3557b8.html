<h1>Republicans DeVito, Francis hope for chance to unseat Rep. Kulik in northwestern Pittsburgh suburbs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Danny DeVito, a 27-year-old Republican law clerk residing in Carnegie, announced his run for the General Assembly on a platform of expanding natural gas production and lowering the burden of property taxes — and, of course, in a cheeky way,&nbsp;embracing in media interviews the fact he shares a name (but not political views) with the goofy actor from the TV show “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.”</p>
<p>Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, however, Mr. DeVito has shifted to more existential questions ahead of the June 2 primary election for the Pennsylvania’s 45th House District.</p>
<p>Mr. DeVito has criticized Gov. Tom Wolf’s stay-at-home order and the state’s closure of all non-essential businesses to stem the spread of the deadly virus. He filed a legal challenge, which argued Mr. Wolf caused “substantial, unprecedented damage to the economy,” that was appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined on May 6 to lift Pennsylvania’s order.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to “deeper philosophical questions about government,” Mr. DeVito said in a phone interview Friday.</p>
<p>“Do we want to have an autocratic government that can just shut down businesses with the stroke of a pen?” he said. “Or do we want a government of liberty that listens to the people?”</p>
<p>Mr. DeVito will face Malek Francis, a civil engineer with PennDOT for 33 years, for the opportunity to run against Rep. Anita Kulik, D-Carnegie, in the fall. The 45th District covers a population of more than 61,000 people spanning Carnegie, Coraopolis, Kennedy, Robinson and part of Scott.</p>
<p>Mr. Francis’ platform includes fighting what he called government waste and corruption, eliminating the school property tax, downsizing the state legislature and campaign contributions. He also supports imposing mandatory death sentences for anyone who kills a police officer.</p>
<p>“I’m very disappointed in our public officials,” he said in an interview. “Corruption at state agencies costing us millions and no one has done anything about it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Francis said he wants to help build a local food supply chain as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have milk here, we have eggs here,” he said.&nbsp;“Our state is an agricultural state and we’re not doing enough to help our farmers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. DeVito,&nbsp;the son of a corrections officer and X-ray technician,&nbsp;grew up in Wayne County in northeastern Pennsylvania. He attended Gannon University in Erie and&nbsp;graduated from the University of Akron School of Law in 2019. He passed the bar exam in February and currently works as a clerk at the Logue Law Group.</p>
<p>He was drawn to run for office in part by Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto’s opposition to fracking, and Mr. Wolf’s proposals for a severance tax on the natural gas industry. Mr. DeVito said those views amounted to a&nbsp;“war on natural gas.”</p>
<p>The state’s order to shut down businesses raised the stakes, Mr. DeVito said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 15, at ReopenPA's rally in Harrisburg, Mr. DeVito took a megaphone and described his battle against Mr. Wolf as a fight against socialism. As a Trump flag rippled next to him, Mr. DeVito led chants of “impeach Wolf.”</p>
<p>Mr. DeVito, in the interview last week, said Mr. Francis had not been outspoken about the shutdown order and that he&nbsp;had not “attended any rallies, filed lawsuits, or spoken out against the governor, while I have been at the forefront.”</p>
<p>Mr. Francis, in the interview, said he supported reopening businesses because&nbsp;“we can work safety,” but preferred striking a more conciliatory tone.</p>
<p>“We have to work together — Republicans and Democrats,” Mr. Francis said. “Enough of attacking each other. The public wants to hear us talk about the issues.”</p>
