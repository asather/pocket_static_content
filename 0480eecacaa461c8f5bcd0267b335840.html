<h1>Penn State student in federal class-action lawsuit seeks tuition refunds over COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Penn State University student has filed a class-action lawsuit seeking tuition refunds for students whose spring semester classes were moved online after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted it and other universities to send students home to slow the virus’ spread.</p>
<p>Tyler Thomson alleges breach of contract and unjust enrichment in his federal suit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Mr. Thomson, identified in the lawsuit as a communications major from New Jersey, names as defendant Penn State through its board of trustees.</p>
<p>He and his attorney seek a jury trial and are demanding return of what the 19-page complaint alleges is wrongfully obtained revenue from altered instruction, as well as a declaration requiring Penn State to notify other students of the complaint who are similarly situated. The university has 96,000 students, including those on its main University Park campus and branches statewide.</p>
<p>A Penn State spokesman could not immediately be reached Monday for comment.</p>
<p>The suit now facing the state’s flagship public university is one among a growing number of cases around the nation and in Pennsylvania challenging the idea that schools, forced to move on-campus in-person instruction to remote learning, should be allowed to charge full tuition prices.</p>
<p>The issue has major financial implications across higher education. Schools, Penn State among them, say they already have absorbed huge financial hits as the pandemic spread, from campus refunds for room and board, to lost fees, costs to transition to remote learning and hits to the values of their campus endowments.</p>
<p>Last week, Penn State President Eric Barron said losses at his institution alone are now “in the hundreds of millions of dollars” and could grow given uncertainty about the fall.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson’s lawsuit stems from a campus closure and what the complaint described as, in essence, an eviction of students from campus.</p>
<p>“While closing campus and transitioning to online classes was the right thing for defendant to do, its decision deprived plaintiff and other members of the Class from recognizing the benefits of in-person instruction, access to campus facilities, student activities and other benefits and services in exchange for which they already had paid tuition and fees,” the suit alleges.</p>
<p>“Plaintiffs and members of the proposed Tuition Class did not choose to attend another institution of higher learning, or to seek an online degree, but instead chose to attend Defendant’s institution and enroll on an in-person basis.”</p>
<p>The complaint notes that even before the pandemic, Penn State offered online instruction through its&nbsp;“World Campus.” It cited prices for that learning platform that are substantially less than what is charged for in-person instruction, both on Penn State’s main and Commonwealth campuses.</p>
<p>For instance, the complaint cited a yearly in-state tuition of $18,454, as well as $34,858 for non-Pennsylvanians like Mr. Thomson.</p>
<p>By comparison, the lawsuit pointed to World Campus prices for online undergraduate instruction it said range from&nbsp;$6,994 to $7,549.</p>
<p>Universities defending against such lawsuits, and others watching the cases unfold from the sidelines, have defended current university practice.</p>
<p>On April 16, as he addressed the school’s University Senate, University of Pittsburgh Chancellor Patrick Gallagher cited some $30 million to $40 million in losses already at his institution, from costs of bringing students home early from overseas programs to room and board refunds. Tuition would be a wholly different matter, he said.</p>
<p>If class-action suits in parts of the nation or other moves prevent schools from charging regular tuition price, the effects would be devastating, Mr. Gallagher warned.</p>
<p>“You will see universities fail,” he said. “There simply is no capacity to support this.”</p>
<p>“We are operating in this mode because of a national emergency, not bait and switch,” he added.</p>
