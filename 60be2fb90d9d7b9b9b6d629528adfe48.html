<h1>Study: Based on company performance, three Western Pennsylvania executives were overpaid</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A new report called out two corporations with operations in Western Pennsylvania for overpaying their CEOs, including North Shore-based aluminum products maker Arconic Inc., which was ranked 29th among the top 100 in the country for excessive executive pay.</p>
<p>Nationwide, computer technology company Oracle Corp., Align Technology Inc., a medical device manufacturer, and entertainment giant Walt Disney Co. took the top three spots, according to an annual survey by As You Sow, a nonprofit shareholder advocacy group based in Berkeley, Calif.</p>
<p>Each year, As You Sow evaluates executive pay at all S&amp;P 500 companies using data provided by Institutional Shareholder Services, a Rockville, Md.-based proxy advisory firm.</p>
<p>As You Sow also uses data provided by HIP Investor Inc., a San Francisco-based investment advisory company, to determine what CEO pay would be in relation to shareholder return over the previous five years.</p>
<p>Median CEO pay last year rose 6%, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, a Rockville, Md.-based proxy adviser.&nbsp;Among the S&amp;P 500 companies, the average CEO received nearly 300 times the median worker’s pay.</p>
<p>“Study after study shows CEO pay moving upward,” the As You Sow survey said. “CEO pay is a core contributor to America’s extreme and growing income inequality.”</p>
<p>Arconic CEO Charles Blankenship Jr., who earned $17.6 million or 31.7% over the $6 million he should have received had the aluminum products maker properly aligned performance and compensation, according to As You Sow’s calculations. His compensation was 353 times higher than the median Arconic worker’s salary of $50,232.</p>
<p>Arconic, a spinoff from aluminum production giant Alcoa Inc., will itself split into two publicly traded companies April 1 following a failed bid to sell the company to a privately equity firm in February 2019.</p>
<p>Former Kraft Heinz CEO Bernardo Hees was listed at 21 on the top 100 list of overpaid executives, but he left the company June 30. Miguel Patricio replaced him.</p>
<p>Mylan N.V. CEO Heather Bresch’s salary of $13.3 million was $2.7 million higher than it should’ve been, based on the pharmaceutical giant’s performance, according to the survey. Compensation for Ms. Bresch, 64th on the top 100 list, was 315 times higher than the Mylan median salary of $42,407.</p>
<p>Ms. Bresch, 50, said she will be retiring from Mylan, which has corporate offices in Cecil and Hertfordshire, England, after the merger with Pfizer’s Upjohn unit, which is expected by midyear.</p>
<p>Officials at Mylan and Arconic did not return calls seeking comment Monday.</p>
<p>Shareholders have been permitted to vote on the pay of the CEO and four other top corporate officers since 2011 under the Dodd-Frank Act. The votes are only advisory.</p>
<p>Starting in 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission mandated that companies disclose pay differences between the CEO and median worker in annual proxies.</p>
<p>The votes have not had a sweeping impact so far.</p>
<p>In the 2019 proxy season, 31.7% of Arconic shareholders voted to oppose the company’s CEO pay package; 11.4% voted no at Mylan.</p>
<p>Support for say-on-pay support shareholder votes fell in 2018 to the lowest level since 2012, according to a review published last year in the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance. At the same time, shareholder engagement increased for environmental proposals, board diversity and other topics.</p>
<p>The say-on-pay failure rate has fluctuated year to year, but has not ended any year lower than 1.4% or above 3% since voting began in 2011,&nbsp;according to an analysis of 1,944 Russell 3000 companies.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with excessive CEO pay? It doesn’t seem to boost financial returns for the company, the As You Sow organization argues.</p>
<p>The new report cited “extremely low” correlations between big compensation packages for CEOs and total shareholder returns.</p>
<p>“There is no proven connection between pay and performance,” the report concluded.</p>
