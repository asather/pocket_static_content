<h1>Nearly 40 Pittsburgh firefighters certified as severe flood response teams</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire announced on Friday that it has completed training to be certified as a Type-3A swift water and flood response team.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight city firefighters were trained and certified at the technician level under the program, and split between two separate teams, city officials said. The Type-3A certification makes the teams regional assets that can be deployed outside of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County for flash-flood and disaster relief.</p>
<p>The new certification is recognized by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Bureau of Emergency Services and the Office of the State Fire Commissioner.</p>
<p>“Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire is on PEMA’s radar now. If a hurricane comes through the Eastern part of the state, PEMA can request our Type-3A team.” Capt. Patrick Shaw said. “We’re actually providing a better service to the citizens, they pay their taxes and we’re here to give them a better service. ... a top notch rescue team is what they have now.”</p>
<p>Capt. Shaw has headed the training program with Engine Truck 17 for the past eight years under city Fire Chief Darryl Jones, city officials said.</p>
<p>Chief Jones began assembling the team after a severe rainstorm caused flash flooding that killed four people along Washington Boulevard in August 2011.</p>
<p>“We were not prepared at that time and now we are prepared.” Chief Jones said. “We’ve been working toward this certification that now recognizes the technician-level training our teams have achieved and officially states that we meet the standard to perform this task, this rescue, this duty.”</p>
