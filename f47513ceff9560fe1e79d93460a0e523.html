<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools is planning to light up the city on Friday in honor of its 2020 graduates.</p>
<p>As part of an event dubbed Light Up the Night, the school system is asking the city to turn on their lights and make noise to celebrate the graduating class.</p>
<p>Locations participating in the event include Cupples Stadium in the South Side, PNC Park, the City-County Building, the Allegheny&nbsp;County Courthouse, Gulf Tower, Koppers Tower, and the PPS Administration Building.</p>

<p>“As seniors finalize their plans for life after high school, we want the class of 2020 to know that&nbsp;we care despite the unforeseen changes to their end of the year celebrations,” Superintendent Anthony&nbsp;Hamlet wrote in a release. “Friday is the perfect opportunity for the city to band together and&nbsp;turn on our lights to show the class of 2020 how proud we are of their recent&nbsp;accomplishments.”</p>
<p>The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused high schools across the country to forgo typical end-of-year events like prom and graduation ceremonies. More than 1,500 students are preparing to graduate from PPS this semester.</p>
