<h1>Pirates place Mitch Keller, Michael Feliz on injured list, recall two</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CHICAGO — While manager Derek Shelton said the Pirates are still evaluating injuries that Mitch Keller and Michael Feliz suffered Saturday night, they’re apparently serious enough to place the pitchers on the 10-day injured list.</p>
<p>The Pirates did that Sunday before a game against the Cubs at Wrigley Field and recalled Cody Ponce and Sam Howard to take their spots. Ponce and Howard were already here because of the taxi squads that exist for the 2020 season.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/08/01/mitch-keller-injury-pirates-cubs-chicago-mlb/stories/202008010067" target="_blank">Keller left the Pirates’ 4-3 loss</a> with two outs in the bottom of the third inning after delivering a curveball in the dirt to Cubs catcher Willson Contreras. The injury was announced as left-side discomfort.</p>
<p>Feliz exited in the eighth with right forearm discomfort. It was less clear what happened to Feliz, although catcher Jacob Stallings seemed to indicate to the Pirates dugout that something did not look right with the reliever.</p>
<p>“Because of the fact that it’s still 12 hours turnaround, we’re still evaluating,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>Most likely to take Keller’s spot in the rotation is JT Brubaker, who threw three scoreless innings Saturday. A 26-year-old rookie, Brubaker made his MLB debut last Sunday in St. Louis and has given the Pirates five scoreless innings, striking out seven and walking one.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that both of Brubaker’s outings have come in games Keller has pitched, meaning he can easily slide into the 24-year-old’s rotation spot.</p>
<p>Brubaker threw three innings Saturday, and Shelton said the Pirates wanted to see how he felt Sunday before determining anything. Keller’s next start would fall Thursday at PNC Park against the Twins.</p>
<p>“We haven’t decided that yet. It’s too soon,” Shelton said. “See how [Brubaker] bounces back with the fact that he had gone three, then we’ll kind of talk through it from there.”</p>
<p>Shelton could also split apart the piggyback of Steven Brault and Chad Kuhl, though that would require one of them pitching on short rest the next time through.</p>
<p>Keller is 1-1 in two starts this season with a 3.52 ERA and three strikeouts. His velocity lagged some in his first start, although it improved in the second.</p>
<p>Feliz has struggled in his three appearances, allowing six earned runs and a homer.</p>
<p>Acquired in the Jordan Lyles trade last season, Ponce went 2-6 with a 4.14 ERA across three leagues last year, striking out 60 in 63 innings. He has not yet pitched in the majors.</p>
<p>Shelton said that Ponce has been stretched out as a starter while working at the Pirates’ satellite camp in Altoona, although it’s unlikely he would jump over Brubaker, Brault or Kuhl.</p>
<p>Howard is a left-handed reliever the Pirates claimed off of waivers from the Rockies last October. He went 2-0 with Colorado in 2019 but had a 6.63 ERA. Howard struck out 23 in 19 innings.</p>
<p>That both could be active for Sunday's game is a perk of the 60-game season, a move made designed to avoid commercial travel. It will also give the Pirates a couple fresh arms in a hassle-free way, as they were already with the team in Chicago.</p>
<p>"It’s very easy to transition them in," Shelton said. "I think with Ponce, first time on a major league roster, that’s always a really cool thing when you’re able to tell a guy that. He’s lengthened out. He has been a starter. He’s at around four innings, so we’re in good shape.</p>
<p>"Then Howard, adding another left-hander into our bullpen, which is nice. The guys in Altoona had been saying he’s been throwing the ball really well, which was one of the reasons we brought him as a taxi guy. I think one of the things they did a really good job with protocol-wise is allowing you to bring guys."</p>
