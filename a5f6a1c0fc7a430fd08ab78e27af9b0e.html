<h1>Pittsburgh musician talks about his bout with COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Like most Americans, David Wheeler, who fronts the Pittsburgh band Outsideinside, has been spending most of time inside.</p>
<p>In fact, Wheeler has done more sheltering-in-place than most of us having tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The 41-year-old singer-guitarist’s acclaimed hard-rock band released its sophomore album, “II,” with a show at the Brillobox in Bloomfield on March 6.</p>
<p>A week later, on Thursday, March 13, the day after the St. Patrick’s Day Parade was canceled and talks of a shutdown were beginning, he started feeling a bit off.</p>
<p>“Nothing that would be alarming most of the time,” Wheeler says. “Just some like body aches, really minor, nothing that I would have even given a second thought to. I called off work that day because we’d already been told if you have any symptoms, just don’t come in, but under normal circumstances, I probably would've gone to work.”</p>
<p>On Monday, March 16, he still had the body aches, plus, some sniffles and no sense of taste and smell.</p>
<p>“But I didn't know anything about that being a symptom, at that point,” he says. “Knowing this thing was going on and I’m four days into something and it’s not getting any better, I called my doctor and they were like, ‘You don't have any symptoms of it, so we can’t you give you a test.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, March 18, a mild fever kicked in, so he went to the drive-in testing facility on the North Side, but they turned him away because he didn’t have a cough or shortness of breath.</p>
<p>“The next day,” he says, “I coughed up some red gunk.”</p>
<p>That’s when the doctor made an appointment for him to be tested on that Saturday on the South Side.</p>
<p>“By the time I was actually getting the test,” he says, “my symptoms started to be pretty bad: fever and chills. My cough never got bad, so I didn’t worry too much, because I thought as long as that stays pretty mild...but then I had five or six days of fever and chills and bad body aches.”</p>
<p>He spent a week in bed with his fever spiking as high as 102. When he tried to take a deep breath, he would cough. He was taking Tylenol, as suggested by his doctor, but it was wearing off three hours or so into a six-hour cycle. With no appetite, he was forcing myself to eat, at best, an orange and a piece of toast through the course of a day.</p>
<p>Keeping a social distance from his wife, Susan Pedrazzi, in a one-bedroom Lawrenceville apartment was tough, but she had had very mild symptoms in early March, so they suspected that she might have immunity. (In late March, Pedrazzi, also a musician, co-founded, with her friend Elizabeth Sanchez, "together/apart,” a project to help local artists, musicians and gig workers by selling merch.)</p>
<p>After the fever and chills passed, Wheeler says he was still fatigued for about a week, and even now, he doesn’t feel like his sense of taste and smell have returned 100 percent.</p>
<p>Since March 13, the 6-foot-5 singer-guitarist has shed 20 pounds.</p>
<p>Other than that, he says, “I’m back to normal now or as normal as anyone else is. I’m furloughed from my job, so I’ve been at home trying to do what I can. The only time we’ll go anywhere is to take a walk or go to the store.”</p>
<p>He’s social-distancing and wearing a mask, because even though he likely has the antibodies, there’s concern that people can be reinfected.</p>
<p>“I’d like to avoid that as much as possible,” he says.</p>
<p>He’s tried to keep his case as low-key as possible, but did reference it on Instagram when the guys at the Lawrenceville club Spirit sent over a pizza and he did post about it on Facebook on Monday.</p>
<p>“In the end, it turned out to be a mild case for me, even though it was brutal at times,” he says. “There are people dying and suffering in a lot worse ways than I was so, so I felt like I didn’t want to attract too much attention to it.”</p>
<p>Like any musician, he’d love to get back to playing —&nbsp;with Outsideinside and side band Limousine Beach — but he knows that could be a while, and for the past month, it’s been a pretty big effort to pick up a guitar.</p>
