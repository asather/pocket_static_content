<p>LOS ANGELES — The Penguins welcomed a pair of important players to practice Tuesday. And no, that’s not referring to their three trade deadline acquisitions.</p>
<p>Defensemen Brian Dumoulin and John Marino returned to practice Tuesday. Each was wearing a non-contact jersey, but their presence suggested that both are on track to return to game action in the near future, perhaps on this trip.</p>
<p>Just 15 days after Marino underwent surgery to repair broken bones in his face, the rookie blue-liner was the first player on the ice before the Penguins practiced at Toyota Performance Center, the practice rink to Wednesday’s opponent, the Los Angeles Kings. He was wearing a full, clear shield to protect his face.</p>
<p>Marino underwent surgery in Pittsburgh on Feb. 10, four days after he took a slap shot to the left cheek from Tampa Bay Lightning center Steven Stamkos. After a “successful” surgery, the Penguins estimated he would miss 3-to-6 weeks.</p>
<p>He has since missed seven games, with the Penguins winning just three.</p>
<p>The Harvard product, whom Pittsburgh acquired for a 2021 sixth-round pick from Edmonton last summer, has five goals, 20 assists and a plus-14 rating in 51 games this season and has averaged more than 20 minutes of ice time per game.</p>
<p>Dumoulin was injured in an odd collision during the Nov. 30 loss in St. Louis. A day later, on Dec. 1, he had surgery at UPMC Presbyterian to repair lacerated tendons in his left ankle. The team said then that he would miss at least eight weeks.</p>
<p>At the time of his injury, the 6-foot-4 blue-liner led the team with a plus-17 rating, was third among Penguins in blocked shots and seventh in hits. He is one of their best penalty-killers and was on pace for a second straight 20-point season.</p>
<p>Dumoulin the past three weeks had more frequently been spotted at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex. Coach Mike Sullivan said he stepped back onto the ice more than a week ago and he has continued to skate on an individual basis.</p>
<p>Now, Kris Letang’s steady partner is able to practice with his teammates.</p>
<p>The new guys – Patrick Marleau, Conor Sheary and Evan Rodrigues – were all present and participating at Tuesday’s practice. But Jared McCann did not skate with the team. Nor did Nick Bjugstad, who has been out more than three months following core muscle surgery. He is here in California, though.</p>
