<html><head><title>Pitt forward Kene Chukwuka's recovery from hip surgery is proceeding, but return date remains uncertain</title></head><body><p>Thirteen games into Pitt’s 2019-20 season, there’s a question, albeit a smaller one, from the weeks before its first game that remains unanswered — if or when will forward Kene Chukwuka be able to return to the court?</p><p>Two days before the Panthers’ Jan. 4 matchup with Wake Forest, their first of 18 consecutive ACC games that will conclude their regular season, the senior’s health remains an evolving situation.</p><p>Pitt coach Jeff Capel said Thursday that he doesn’t know the timetable for a potential return to game action for the 6-foot-9 forward, but he noted that Chukwuka, for the first time since undergoing hip surgery last March, did some “stuff physically” in practice, even participating in five-on-five drills.</p><p>“I don’t know how far away he is from actually competing,” Capel said. “My guess is that we’ll evaluate him after today, see how he feels, see if he’s able to do anything tomorrow. If he is, then we’ll go from there and see over the next few days. But it was good to have him back out there.”</p><p>As far back as last May, Capel said Chukwuka could miss a significant amount of time as he recovered from surgery, which corrected a hip injury that bothered him at times late last season and forced him to miss the Panthers’ final game, a loss to Syracuse in the ACC tournament. In August, the second-year Pitt coach said if the Stockholm, Sweden native did return during the 2019-20 season, it would “be sometime probably in January.”</p><p>Last season, Chukwuka averaged 3.9 points and 3.5 rebounds in 17.8 minutes per game, splitting time with then-sophomore Terrell Brown in a two-man rotation at center. Those numbers were improvements from the 2.5 points and 2.7 rebounds per game he averaged in a nearly identical number of minutes he played as a sophomore.</p><p>Unlike last season, when Chukwuka and Brown were the only two big men for much of the campaign, the Panthers have more depth at the position now. Eric Hamilton, a 6-foot-9 graduate transfer, is averaging 6.3 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. Brown, while still wildly inconsistent, has had strong moments, like a 13-point effort in a season-opening win against Florida State. Freshman Abdoul Karim Coulibaly has provided encouragement in limited minutes, displaying soft hands and deft footwork that exceed his modest numbers (two points and 1.3 rebounds per game).</p><p>While a fully healed Chukwuka would provide an additional option for the frontcourt, the program and its roster is in better shape than it was a year ago, meaning his return wouldn’t have to be rushed.</p><p>“I think we have more bodies,” Capel said. “I think we have more guys that can play and that can help us.”</p><p><em>Craig Meyer: cmeyer@post-gazette.com and Twitter @CraigMeyerPG</em></p></body></html>
