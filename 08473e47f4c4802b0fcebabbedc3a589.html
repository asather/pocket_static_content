<h1>Sources: Pirates to promote Ke’Bryan Hayes for Tuesday’s game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>MILWAUKEE — With the trade deadline now passed, the Pirates intend to finally promote third-base prospect Ke’Bryan Hayes, sources told the Post-Gazette on Monday.</p>
<p>Hayes, 23, has been working out at the Pirates’ satellite camp in Altoona. It’s likely, according to one source, that Hayes will be in the starting lineup whenever the Pirates host the Cubs on Tuesday at PNC Park.&nbsp;It will be Hayes’ MLB debut.</p>
<p>A first-round pick in 2015, Hayes hit .265/.336/.415 with Class AAA Indianapolis in 2019, with 10 home runs, 53 RBIs, 43 walks, 30 doubles and 12 stolen bases.</p>
<p>Ke’Bryan Hayes is the son of former major leaguer and Pirate Charlie Hayes, and defense has been the younger Hayes’ calling card. He has won three consecutive Gold Gloves in the minor leagues, while his fielding percentage of .989 in 2019 was the best for a third baseman at any level.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, Hayes committed just 17 errors in 331 games (872 chances).</p>
<p>The Pirates were likely waiting until after the deadline to promote Hayes to afford others playing time and allow them a chance to increase their trade value.</p>
<p>Now, the Pirates will have to manage a rotation at third base that will include Hayes and Erik Gonzalez more often than not.</p>
<p>MLB Pipeline considers Hayes the Pirates’ second-best prospect behind 2020 first-rounder Nick Gonzales. Hayes ranks No. 45 overall, while Gonzales is No. 40. Oneil Cruz is the Pirates’ third top 100 prospect at No. 69.</p>
