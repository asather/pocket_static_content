<p>Thursday was not a typical day in the life even for Billy Porter, who seems to be living life at a fever pitch these days.</p>
<p>One minute, the buzz on social media was about Donald Trump Jr. using Pittsburgh native Porter as a meme&nbsp;“to throw shade” at Hunter Biden, as Porter put it on Twitter. And in the next hot tweet, he was seen in his tuxedo gown from the 2019 Oscars, hugging Elmo for a&nbsp;“Sesame Street” appearance.</p>
<p>The Grammy-, Tony- and Emmy-winning star of&nbsp;“Pose” on FX was fresh off his red-carpet dominance at the Grammy Awards Sunday, when he wore a teal motorized hat with movable fringe that surrounded the brim.</p>
<p>As Vanity Fair described the reason his looks are so anticipated and never disappointing:&nbsp;“Porter is a hot ticket for the quality of his looks, not just the quantity. The Broadway legend and ‘Pose’ star has an uncanny ability to stand out and speak up with his clothes no matter the occasion.”</p>
<p>Donald Trump Jr. used a meme of Porter’s motorized hat at work that prompted a quick shutdown from Porter:</p>

<p>Later in the day, Sesame Street tweeted photos of Porter on the “Sesame Street” set in that now iconic gown. The tweet said: “Billy Porter bringing those fierce vibes to Sesame Street,” with a fire emoji and #Season51 (no airdate set).</p>
<p>When the Twitterverse reacted with both positive and negative reactions to the out-and-proud LBGQT+ activist, fans retweeted a Street credo:&nbsp;“Sesame Street is proud to support families of all shapes, sizes, and colors.&nbsp;♥”</p>
