<h1>Courting Black votes </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A recurring theme of the Republican National Convention was that the Black vote is not the exclusive property of the Democrats — that Black voters, like their white counterparts, will make their decisions based on what’s best for themselves, their families and their communities.</p>
<p>A host of Black speakers kicked off the convention with messages of support for President Donald Trump, sharing stories of personal accomplishment and overcoming obstacles while assuring viewers that Mr. Trump has acted in the best interests of the Black community.</p>
<p>Most of all, they made the case that Mr. Trump does not deserve to be labeled as a racist, a pointed counter to claims made by the president’s opponents.</p>
<p>Former NFL running back and Heisman Trophy-winner Herschel Walker spoke of his 37-year friendship with Mr. Trump, noting that the president is committed to resolving social justice issues.</p>
<p>“Just because someone loves and respects the flag, our national anthem and our country doesn’t mean they don’t care about social justice,” Mr. Walker said.</p>
<p>He added that “Growing up in the Deep South, I have seen racism close up. I know what it is. And it isn’t Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>The powerful speech by Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., charted his journey from growing up poor in a single-parent household, and how his grandfather was forced to drop out of school in the third grade to pick cotton.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott made a compelling argument that jobs and a robust economy may be the best civil rights initiative of all, and spoke of legislation he spearheaded, with cooperation from Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., to create opportunity zones. Mr. Trump signed the bill into law, bringing more than $75 billion of private-sector investment into underserved communities.</p>
<p>Congressional candidate Kimberly Klacik reminded voters of the unprecedented economic job market growth — including the lowest minority unemployment in U.S. history, a milestone reached during the Trump years preceding COVID-19.</p>
<p>And Democratic Georgia state Rep. Vernon Jones&nbsp;challenged his own party on what he sees as its drift away from traditional moral values, citing “a dangerous tolerance for people who attack others, who destroy property, and terrorize our communities.”</p>
<p>The message from Black speakers was clear: The Black community is not, as Mr. Scott noted, a “monolithic community.” The community is composed of many independent thinkers who can freely judge the value of a candidate. And the label of racist against Mr. Trump is something they see as unproven and unfair.</p>
