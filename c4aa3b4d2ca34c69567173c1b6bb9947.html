<h1>IUP facilities manager files suit, says school president fired him for warning about COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The former facilities manager at Indiana University of Pennsylvania says the school’s president fired him three weeks ago after he sent out a warning to employees about COVID-19 risk.</p>
<p>Donald Woolslayer named President Michael Driscoll in a one-count complaint in federal court citing "retaliation for speaking on a matter of public concern" under the First and 14th Amendments.</p>
<p>Mr. Woolslayer had been the director of facilities since 2016. He and his lawyer, Sam Cordes, said that in late March he learned that the spouse of one of his employees had contracted the virus.</p>
<p>He said he thought he should alert IUP employees about the infection so they could take precautions. His supervisors and the school's human resources office recommended that he not, according to the suit.</p>
<p>But he did anyway.</p>
<p>On March 30, he sent out an email to multiple addresses in which he said "one of our colleagues is self-quarantined due to exposure to COVID-19.” He also notified his supervisor and told employees that they should talk to their doctors about the risk and what to do.</p>
<p>He said the human resources department objected to the notification.</p>
<p>The next day, he said, Mr. Driscoll fired him, saying he had "lost confidence" in his abilities to do his job.</p>
<p>He said the president also canceled his health insurance despite knowing that Mr. Woolslayer has ongoing medical conditions.</p>
<p>The suit says Mr. Driscoll fired Mr. Woolslayer in retaliation for speaking out on the COVID-19 risk in "reckless disregard" for his federally-protected rights.</p>
<p>The suit is asking that Mr. Woolslayer be reinstated with back pay and benefits as well as unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p>IUP&nbsp;said Tuesday that it does not comment on litigation.</p>
