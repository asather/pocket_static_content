<h1>Fossil fuels can stay viable through tech developed here, NETL leaders say</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the National Energy Technology Laboratory launched its Marcellus Shale Energy and Environment Laboratory five years ago, the focus was on making sure fracking isn’t harming the environment.</p>
<p>NETL strapped a bunch of instruments onto a Marcellus Shale well site in West Virginia and monitored air and water quality during the life cycle of the wells.</p>
<p>Today, with 16 more such field labs added to the U.S. Department of Energy’s fossil fuel research portfolio — most of them in the past year — the goal has widened to helping companies understand how to frack better.</p>
<p>These field labs —&nbsp;spread out throughout U.S. oil and gas basins, including one in Alaska —&nbsp;are collecting and analyzing tons of data that is already challenging industry practices.</p>
<p>For example, NETL scientists and their partners in industry have found that identifying and working with the natural fractures that exist in the path of a horizontal shale well produces better results than fracking at predetermined intervals — e.g. every 300 feet — along the lateral.</p>
<p>Why should the government invest money in making fracking more efficient?</p>
<p>Brian Anderson, director of NETL, said it’s not just for the companies’ bottom lines, which are currently at historic lows.</p>
<p>Being more efficient with water and sand, and getting more gas out of the ground from the same well, leads to a smaller footprint on the surface, he said.</p>
<p>It might be hard to believe the shale gas glut that made the U.S. the top producer of natural gas in the world and that has brought gas prices —&nbsp;and the companies that rely on them — to their knees, was made possible by recovering less than 10% of the gas from the drilled wells.</p>
<p>“What if we could increase that by half?” Ken Humphreys wondered. “We’d have 1.5 shale gas revolutions.”</p>
<p>Mr. Humphreys, a senior adviser to the DOE assistant secretary for fossil fuels Steve Winberg, was in town last month to attend NETL’s third annual celebration of accomplishments.</p>
<p>It was held inside NETL’s South Park campus in a large room full of posters and researchers ready to explain their work and eat celebratory cake.</p>
<p>Regional politicians gave short speeches, praising the scientists’ efforts in developing technologies that they hope could keep fossil fuels — and the communities where they are extracted — viable in a carbon-constrained future. That’s assuming such a future is the goal of a future administration.</p>
<p>Should that day come,&nbsp;Mr. Humphreys and Mr. Anderson stressed the Department of Energy’s Coal First initiative will ensure the U.S. is ready.</p>
<p>The “first” stands for flexible, innovative, resilient, small, transformative.&nbsp;The goal of this effort, which doles out money to projects under the umbrella, is to advance the idea that coal can be used with “zero, near zero or negative emissions,” according to Mr. Humphreys.</p>
<p>That could mean building small, efficient coal-powered generation plants with carbon capture or turning the mined material into other salable products, such as graphine or rare earth materials.</p>
<p>Even if the U.S. continues its departure from coal and doesn’t replace retiring power plants with newer, updated coal-burning ones, NETL technology could help U.S. companies sell their equipment abroad, Mr. Humphreys said.</p>
<p>If coal continues to be a major energy source, as the International Energy Agency predicts, Mr. Humphreys said, “we would much rather see U.S. technology exported internationally.”</p>
