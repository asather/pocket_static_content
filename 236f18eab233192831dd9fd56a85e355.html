<h1>Proposal calls for creating Pa. government advocate to help students navigating college debt </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In a state where average college debt tops $37,000, students need an advocate within state government to better navigate the process and potential pitfalls, Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale says.</p>
<p>So he is recommending creation of a Special Office of Student Loan Advocate or ombudsman to assist students decision-making in a complicated, high-stakes process — made even more so&nbsp;by the COVID-19 pandemic that has shifted ways institutions deliver instruction and further laid bare inequities about who can afford college.</p>
<p>Mr. DePasquale made the proposal in releasing a follow-up audit of the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. His report addressed both debt itself and PHEAA’s progress in dealing with questionable or unethical financial actions cited in the initial 2008 report by former Auditor General Jack Wagner, and Mr. DePasquale reiterated calls for restructuring of the agency’s board.</p>
<p>Mr. DePasquale, who is doing a briefing with reporters on his findings in Harrisburg, has what he believes is a logical home for his proposed student loan office.</p>
<p>“The Pennsylvania Treasury would be the right place to house this type of ombudsman,” he said.&nbsp;“It’s an independent office that already houses a college savings plan.”</p>
<p>PHEAA administors the state grant program. It also is among the&nbsp;nation’s largest servicers of student loans</p>
<p>Financial aid experts and others one campuses who work with Pennsylvania students long have acknowledged the disparity in&nbsp;resources available to guide students figuring out how to afford college.&nbsp; Disadvantaged students, including those who are the first in their families to attend college, are especially vulnerable.</p>
<p>The proposed new office or ombudsman would help educate students about the process and give them a voice.</p>
<p>“While some students have the assistance of knowledgeable parents, many students are&nbsp;navigating these life-changing decisions on their own,” the auditor general said in a letter accompanying his 25-page report.</p>
<p>“Since 2017, 10 other states have created such an office, and&nbsp;the central tenet of their mission is to improve the outcomes for student loan borrowers in their states.”</p>
<p>Among the jurisdictions are the states of Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland,&nbsp;Minnesota, New York, Nevada, Virginia, and Washington and the District of Columbia, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. DePasquale said PHEAA has made strides implementing reforms following Mr. Wagner’s report. But he said more work needs to be done</p>
<p>His report recommends that the General Assembly “restructure&nbsp;PHEAA’s board of directors, decrease the&nbsp;number of legislators,&nbsp;and add diverse&nbsp;members from&nbsp;education, finance and&nbsp;other fields in the&nbsp;private sector.”</p>
<p>He also urged that the agency continue&nbsp;“to monitor all expenses&nbsp;and direct as much&nbsp;funding as possible to&nbsp;help ensure that&nbsp;Pennsylvanians can&nbsp;achieve an affordable&nbsp;education and ensure&nbsp;that students take the&nbsp;priority over PHEAA&nbsp;executives and&nbsp;management level&nbsp;employees.”</p>
<p>The 2008 audit by Mr. Wagner included findings “that PHEAA&nbsp;executives were spending lavish amounts to award executives millions of&nbsp;dollars in bonuses, to take expensive travel trips to luxury resorts, and to create and promote excessive promotional&nbsp;and advertising materials,” Mr. DePasquale wrote in his letter.</p>
<p>“All of this was made possible by a culture that awarded those at the top instead of&nbsp;devoting taxpayer-funded resources to help Pennsylvania’s vulnerable, and promising, students.”</p>
<p>His follow-up audit released Thursday pointed to reforms already implemented, including reducing the agency’s vehicle fleet, tightening travel expenditure rules and bringing financial incentives for individuals including executives more in line with state government.</p>
