<h1>Planning commission again rejects design of proposed Strip District 21-story office tower </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Planning Commission, still unhappy with designs for a 21-story office tower meant to replace the Strip District building best known for its smiling neon fish sign, is not budging.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the commission said no to an altered version of the tower, repeating concerns they’d brought up&nbsp;last month regarding massing and a lack of adequate public space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the development team can try yet again.</p>
<p>The proposed retail and office building at 1501 Penn Ave. would sit on the footprint of the former New Federal Cold Storage warehouse, a site bordered by Penn Avenue, Smallman Street, 15th Street and the 16th Street Bridge. The warehouse’s signature fish sign on the 15th Street side was visible from Interstate 579.</p>
<p>JMC Holdings, a New York-based developer, bought the property in 2018 and has held 20 meetings with city officials and other stakeholders since.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the ambitious design has drawn some criticism, including from Mayor Bill Peduto, who has said the building's massive size doesn't fit the character of the Strip,&nbsp;Matt Cassin, a founding partner of JMC, said Tuesday, “We are proud of the design of this building. We believe the scale will stand the test of time.”</p>
<p>JMC’s development team described the block of the Strip District as currently being a “dead zone” and a “no man’s land.”</p>
<p>Architect Brandon Haw argued for the density that the new building would bring and described the planned office tower — which would include a seven-story, 846-space parking garage, with 122 additional covered spaces for bicycles, and street-level retail —&nbsp;as a transition building between Downtown and the Strip.</p>
<p>He said the old windowless building, with its tight column grids and bunker-style construction, could not be repurposed, although the foundation would be retained and restyled.</p>
<p>The site is zoned as part of the Golden Triangle District-B, which does not restrict the height of a building.</p>
<p>Yet the height of the building wasn’t so much at issue with the commission as the massing —&nbsp;it rises up off the street on all sides, without setbacks except for a raised colonnade along the Smallman Street side.</p>
<p>The building sits in a flood plain, which made raising the first floor above street level necessary, Mr. Haw said, defending the colonnade as public space.&nbsp;“Raised walkways are part of the character of Smallman Street,” he said. “Colonnades are valuable pieces of the public realm.”</p>
<p>The design shows the covered colonnade with an inviting assortment of seating, including people playing chess, and the steps up to the colonnade include bleacher seating.</p>
<p>Several commissioners said they are not convinced the colonnade would pass as welcoming public space.</p>
<p>Commissioner Becky Mingo compared it to the large porch of her residence. One could climb the steps to get to it, but she said most people would feel out of place doing that.</p>
<p>The tower, which would afford 520,000 square feet of office space, features 10-foot high windows, separated on each floor by spandrel panels that are suggestive of the horizontal nature of the rest of Smallman Street.</p>
<p>Andrew Miller of CBRE, a real estate company that would be part of the leasing team, said the design and location “serves a critical purpose of employment growth. We have an awesome cluster of tech firms that, as they mature, will need office facilities like this. Development needs to be ahead of the demand.”</p>
<p>But, “This is not a building that says anything about Pittsburgh,” Ms. Mingo said.</p>
<p>She also said the parking garage, above retail on the Penn Avenue side, looked monolithic, “a chunk of a building. You are great designers and you started out not solving this design problem.”</p>
<p>The commissioners didn’t seem impressed by any changes made since the last time the development came before them.</p>
<p>“I’m still flummoxed by the tower,” said Chair Christine Mondor. “Height isn’t the issue, it’s the massing.” She compared the footprint to the U.S. Steel building with the UPMC sign on Grant Street. “Buildings that size have a plaza.”</p>
<p>“I find the building disappointing,” said Commissioner Sabina Deitrick. “Pittsburgh is very unusual as a city. Having a wholesale food district right next to the Downtown is very unusual.”</p>
<p>She disdained the proposal’s interruption of the context of the area.</p>
<p>“The context is flow, the railroad flows, the rivers flow, there is a lot of flow on a horizontal level,” she said.</p>
<p>This proposed building, she said, “is stark, vertical, and it breaks the plane of every view. It looks like something you’d see in suburban Dallas or Houston. It’s massive. I have so many problems [with this]. This could have been interesting and innovative.”</p>
<p>As proposed, the building would have green roofing on both levels —&nbsp;the top of the nine-story piece facing Penn and on the top of the 21st story —&nbsp;which project engineer Ben Hunter said would absorb 5,426 cubic feet of rain volume in a one-year-storm event.</p>
<p>Forty-two percent of the pavement in the area would be pervious, mitigating runoff from storms.</p>
