<h1>Paul Zeise mailbag: Will the Steelers be able to keep Bud Dupree long term?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Don:</strong> Do you think the Steelers will now sign Bud Dupree to a long-term deal now? Or do you think this is a one-year deal for him and they will have to let him go?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> It seems like it will be a one-year deal and then they will have to let him go. They are not going to be able to pay both him and T.J. Watt and they have made it clear that Watt is their priority. He will get a long-term deal. The problem they have next year is they still would have Ben Roethlisberger on the books, so if they wanted to tag him again they would have to cut half the roster to make it work. Watt is the guy they will sign and they will now have a year to come up with Dupree’s replacement.</p>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Why would the Steelers not sign B.J. Finney? They don’t have enough linemen and now they lose Foster and Finney. It makes no sense.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> They couldn’t afford him, plain and simple. They had a number they were willing to give him, and the Seahawks gave him a lot more. That’s part of the business when you are in a salary cap league. You cannot sign all the guys you want to sign. You just can’t. They wanted to keep him, and they said as much. They also knew it would be tough because teams need offensive linemen and Finney is a solid, legitimate, NFL lineman.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anthony:</strong> Am I reading this right — Ben’s salary cap hit for 2021 is $40 million? What are the Steelers thinking? Why would they do this for a 38-year old quarterback?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Yes, basically the Steelers are going to go all in to win this year. They can’t keep moving all this money down the road and expect it not to catch up. I would think they have a plan to try and accommodate that number for next year but, man, that’s a lot of the cap tied up in one guy. But the owners are expecting the cap to increase dramatically next year.</p>
<p><strong>Jack T:</strong> Do you think Tampa is now a Super Bowl contender? I figured he would only sign with a team that seems to be built to win now but I am not sure Tampa is so it seemed strange that he signed with them.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I do not. I wrote last week that someone will be very disappointed when they give Tom Brady a big contract. I just don’t think he has much left. I don’t think he can make all the throws he used to make. I don’t think he can move around and get out of sacks and hits like he used to do — and he better figure it out in Bruce Arians’ offense. I just don’t see how this puts them over the top, but hey, the weather is a lot better in Tampa than Boston so he has that going for him.</p>
<p><strong>Theodore:&nbsp;</strong>Is there a reason why Capel cannot pick up big time players of the kind he supposedly recruited at Duke? He sure isn’t doing anything great with the players he has now.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I think he has a good recruiting class coming in. He has some even better players committed from upcoming classes. He is recruiting well. This year he had a roster that lacked size, lacked depth, lacked a true point guard, had a&nbsp;“shooter” who shot about 33 percent from the 3-point line -— what exactly did you expect? I am really confused by people who don’t understand where the program is relative to the rest of the ACC. He had a flawed roster and it showed.</p>
<p><strong>Nick:</strong> Do you think Tom Brady has enough influence to pull off getting Tampa to sign Antonio Brown?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Yes and I think it will happen.</p>
<p><strong>Ian:&nbsp;</strong>Do you think if those 2 Utah Jazz players did not test positive for COVID-19, that all sports would've still been on,(albeit in empty arena games), until someone did test positive for the virus?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> No, there was an official from one of the conferences that tested positive maybe a day later and that would have shut it all down. It was gonna happen within 24-48 hours anyway. I think at first the thought was&nbsp;“athletes are young and strong, let’s see them play with no fans.” But it quickly became clear that wasn’t going to be realistic.</p>
<p><strong>Albert:&nbsp;</strong>Since there are no sports to discuss, I I figured I’d ask a non-sports question: Who, in your opinion, is the most famous living person in the history of the world?&nbsp;I’m thinking Sir Paul McCartney? You??</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong>&nbsp;Famous or popular? Those are two different things. I would say the most famous person (i.e., most well-known) right now is Donald Trump. The most popular, however, might be LeBron James or Elton John.</p>
