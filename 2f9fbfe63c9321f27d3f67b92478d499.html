<h1>PPS board to vote on Hamlet's contract renewal next week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools board will vote next week on whether it will renew Superintendent Anthony Hamlet’s contract for a term of four years.</p>
<p>District solicitor Ira Weiss said Thursday that the contract renewal will be included in the August human resources report that board members will vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as school board member Sala Udin released figures showing low scores among Black elementary students on standardized tests and after Mr. Udin sent a letter to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this month cautioning that the contract renewal was being rushed through.</p>
<p>If approved, the contract would run from July 1, 2021, to June 30, 2025. Mr. Weiss said the board would only vote on the renewal and length of the contract Wednesday, while other details, such as salary, would be determined at a later time.</p>
<p>The board did not talk about renewing Mr. Hamlet at an agenda review meeting Wednesday night or at any other recent public meetings.&nbsp;But it has been discussed during executive session.</p>
<p>Mr. Weiss said the board did not have to bring up the contract at a public meeting because it is a personnel matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The board does not get into HR matters at agenda review,” Mr. Weiss said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Hamlet’s five-year contract he received in 2016 expires June 30, 2021. The school board has until Feb. 1, 2021, to inform Mr. Hamlet if it intends to renew his contract.</p>
<p>Controversies have plagued Mr. Hamlet since the beginning of his tenure in Pittsburgh, from accusations of inaccuracies in his resume, to a high rate of staff turnover, to questions about his relationships with outside vendors.</p>
<p>Those criticisms led <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/06/04/Pittsburgh-Public-Schools-Superintendent-Anthony-Hamlet-board-letter-black-women/stories/202006040167" target="_blank">a group of more than 50 Black women</a> to send a letter to school board members in June urging against the renewal of Mr. Hamlet’s contract.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamlet, however, does have supporters in the community.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/07/13/Western-PA-Black-Political-Assembly-supports-PPS-Anthony-Hamlet-contract/stories/202007100097" target="_blank">Western Pennsylvania Black Political Assembly</a> said in July that&nbsp;Mr. Hamlet has “built a foundation” that has moved the district in the right direction academically as well as in other areas.</p>
<p>Members of the public will have an opportunity to comment on the possible renewal of Mr. Hamlet’s contract at a comment session before the school board Monday night.&nbsp;</p>
