<h1>What Heather Lyke's 'Victory Heights' reveal means for the future of Pitt athletics</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In August 2017, four months after being hired as Pitt's new athletic director, Heather Lyke invited the university's Board of Trustees to tour Fitzgerald Field House with her. It was a hot day in the multi-purpose venue, maybe a tad too hot to be hiking around then a 66-year-old facility.</p>
<p>But from Lyke's perspective, it was a “perfectly timed temperature.”</p>
<p>“It's a 1951 building. We all know that, and it’s filled with historic, amazing memories,” Lyke said Tuesday, with an obvious <em>but</em> on the way. “But I know our board realized immediately that this was not the ideal teaching environment for our coaches and student-athletes.”</p>
<p>The board and Lyke knew changes needed to be made. Monumental changes. The kind of changes for which you hold an elaborate reveal at the Petersen Events Center in front of donors, coaches, media and administrators. Changes that could — and, if all goes to plan, should — shape the future of Pitt athletics.</p>
<p>Lyke and Chancellor Patrick Gallagher unveiled the athletic department's “Victory Heights” facilities initiative on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The multi-layered plan features: a 3,500-seat arena that will house Pitt's volleyball, wrestling and gymnastics programs; an eight-lane, 300-meter indoor track venue utilized for men's and women's track, as well as a band facility; and an athletic performance center for Pitt's non-football and non-basketball sports, handling strength and conditioning, sports medicine, nutrition and mental well-being needs.</p>
<p>“Our student-athletes chose to come to Pitt because they believe this is a place they can become successful,” Gallagher said. “They bring extraordinary talent and energy. But they need the support structure. We owe it to them. These facilities are their classrooms, their laboratories, their study halls, their fields of dreams.”</p>
<p>Added Lyke: “These environments are places where our coaches can build legacies and win championships and make Pitt a destination place.”</p>
<p>“Victory Heights” is an ambitious project. The arena, performance center and indoor track will cost around $250 million total, Lyke said. But Pitt's leadership is confident in the athletic department's ability to raise funds and pay for the new buildings.</p>
<p>Whatever bill isn’t raised will be footed by the university.</p>
<p>“The university is debt financing the project, which is why we’re going to make the commitment that this is going to happen,” Gallagher said. “I think particularly in the face of failed past promises to do this, it was an important step for us to make this commitment.”</p>
<p>But Lyke said 10 members of Pitt's “Champions Advisory Board,” a group of active donors, already gave six and seven-figure commitments in anticipation of Tuesday’s announcement.</p>
<p>“And I know that others will give now that they know what's coming and the impact it will have,” the athletic director added. “Victory Heights will transform our student-athlete experience.”</p>
<p>The arena and sports performance center will be Pitt's first project, breaking ground in summer 2021 and opening in fall 2023. Those two structures will be built on the green space between the Petersen Events Center and Panther Hall.</p>
<p>The track and band complex will "stagger a year later," Lyke said, and will be built on the backside of the Cost Center, where Pitt's sports dome is currently located.</p>
<p>And the third aspect of Pitt's “Victory Heights” project — the Panthers' new lacrosse field — does not have a set timeline yet. However, Lyke said her and her officials “absolutely know it can fit where it is located on the OC [Parking] Lot.”</p>
<p>Lyke also said no surrounding neighborhoods will be touched or affected in the project and that parking “will not be impacted” with the addition of the arena and indoor track. “We're not removing parking for those two projects,” the athletic director added.</p>
<p>However, Pitt stands to eventually lose the OC Lot with the lacrosse field's construction. That could bring on parking issues. But, should Fitzgerald Field House be razed and its space paved, that could alleviate concerns. Gallagher said the university has not decided whether or not Fitzgerald Field House will be demolished.</p>
<p>“That is yet to be determined,” Lyke added, when asked about the fate of the field house and Trees Hall. “Those will obviously not be necessary for continued athletic uses. I think it will be a part of our campus planning as we move forward.”</p>
<p>While there's history ingrained in Fitzgerald's walls, those who inhabit the facility are welcoming their moves into more advanced, spacious digs.</p>
<p>Dan Fisher, the women's volleyball coach who recently inked a seven-year contract extension after a 30-2 season, believes the 3,500-seat arena and the program's practice facility will be the best an ACC program has to offer.</p>
<p>Women's gymnastics coach Samantha Snider agreed, adding that the setup will rival what Big Ten and Big 12 teams have. Wrestling coach Keith Gavin called the arena a “game-changer” in recruiting and the practice facility a logistical relief.</p>
<p>“Our layout [right now] is a little funny, and it's just not big enough,” Gavin said. “We'll do practice now where the first five weight classes get on the mat and the rest of the guys are off riding the bike or something. If we do them all together, they'll run into each other, and then you have unnecessary injuries.”</p>
<p>Alonzo Webb, Pitt's longtime track &amp; field and cross country coach, echoed that sentiment when asked about the planned indoor track. Webb said he and his athletes never make or made excuses. But he voiced his concerns over the team's past and present situation practicing in Fitzgerald Field House.</p>
<p>"Our kids are going around blind turns. On both turns, you can't see," Webb said. "That's been the biggest challenge. As a coach, you're nervous every single day that you're down there practicing that one of your athletes are going to get hit or hurt or someone else's athlete is going to get hurt."</p>
<p>Assuming Lyke's “Victory Heights” vision is eventually realized, those issues, those worries will no longer linger in the back of Webb's mind. Not only that, but Pitt's coach since 2002 can confidently walk into a recruit's home and pitch the program having its own space to operate.</p>
<p>Webb said he's been promised a facility by numerous athletic directors over the years, none of which came to fruition.</p>
<p>"But now with Heather, it's actually happening," the coach said, still somewhat surprised himself. "It's going to happen. ... And it's going to make a big difference for us."</p>
<p>As those words left Webb's lips — and as Fisher, Snider and Gavin spoke glowingly about the plan and the conviction behind it — Lyke stood nearby in the Petersen Events Center media room smiling. Seeing a man like Webb, Pitt's longest-tenured head coach, speak candidly about what lies ahead stuck with Lyke.</p>
<p>And that was the plan all along, really: to provide a pathway for the Panthers to exceed what they've already accomplished, to make up for their shortcomings and to compete for championships both in the ACC and nationally.</p>
<p>Lyke, when addressing the crowd before her media Q&amp;A session, explained that every January her and her leadership team meet to discuss the 12 months ahead. And in those kickoff meetings, each individual picks a word that resonates with them, something to focus on for the coming calendar year.</p>
<p>In January 2018, Lyke's word was “transform,” as in transforming the belief in and around the athletic department. In January 2019, it was “execute,” as in executing Pitt’s part in the launch of the ACC Network, executing the Petersen Events Center court flip and executing the color and logo change. And last week, Lyke's word for 2020 was “raise.”</p>
<p>“It's about raising expectations here. It's about raising awareness for the needs. It's about raising funds to invest in this facility. And most importantly, it's about raising these kids,” Lyke said, referring to Pitt's athletes. “There’s been a process, and it's led to Victory Heights.</p>
<p>“And Victory Heights is our demonstrated commitment to comprehensive excellence."</p>
