<h1>Play-action, drops and missed tackles: Steelers by the numbers in 2019</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>You know the major numbers. All that really matters is .500. Or 8-8. That’s the totality of the Steelers’ 2019 season.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you’re probably aware that T.J. Watt had 14.5 sacks and Bud Dupree 10.5. Maybe you’ve even seen the 18-19 touchdown-to-interception ratio for the team’s quarterbacks. And yes, they scored exactly one touchdown in the final four games and eight in the final nine.</p>
<p>But what about what was the Steelers’ most common defensive lineup? Or which player missed the most tackles? Or how often they ran the ball on first down? These are the facts and figures we’d like to get into here, courtesy of the <a href="https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/" target="_blank">NFL’s own statistical system</a>, <a href="http://pro-football-reference.com/" target="_blank">Pro Football Reference</a> and <a href="https://www.sharpfootballstats.com/personnel-grouping-frequency.html" target="_blank">Sharp Football Stats</a>.</p>
<p><strong>35 —</strong> The number of plays that the Steelers used their most frequent lineup on offense. Quick, can you think of the 11 guys who played together the most for this banged-up offense in 2019? Take a minute to make your guess. We’ll wait. OK … the most-used combination was: Mason Rudolph, James Conner, JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Washington, Diontae Johnson, Vance McDonald, Alejandro Villanueva, Ramon Foster, Maurkice Pouncey, David DeCastro and Matt Feiler. That group edged out by two snaps the same 11 but with Conner replaced by Jaylen Samuels.</p>
<p><strong>7.49 —</strong> Here’s one thing that might surprise you: That top 11 we just mentioned averaged 7.49 yards per play. It helps that 31 of those 35 snaps were passes, but that was the highest per-play output by any group that played more than 10 snaps together. Just for fun, the lineup that averaged the most yards per play for the Steelers? Ben Roethlisberger, Ryan Switzer, Donte Moncrief, Washington, Smith-Schuster, McDonald (lined up in the backfield) and the usual offensive line. That’s who was in the game when Roethlisberger found Washington for a 45-yard gain in the season opener at New England, and that specific personnel never got together again.</p>
<p><strong>78 —</strong>&nbsp;Percentage of plays the Steelers ran out of 11 personnel, which is one running back, one tight end and three receivers. Only eight teams used that personnel grouping more frequently, according to Sharp Football Stats.</p>
<p><strong>54 —</strong> Percent of the time Randy Fichtner called a run on first-and-10. Yeah, your uncle keeps telling you that the Steelers “run on first down every time,” and that’s part of the reason why they need to fire the offensive coordinator. But now you have the hard statistics for the next time you have that conversation, rather than just the anecdotal evidence. Some other notable percentages: On second-and-1, the Steelers ran 70% of the time. On third-and-1, that rose to 77.8%. But on third-and-2? Just 23% of the time, Fichtner called a run, and on fourth-and-1, they opted to throw 3 of 4 times (converting one of those four attempts, on a pass).</p>
<p><strong>4.5 —</strong>&nbsp;Average completed air yards for Rudolph <em>and</em> Devlin Hodges. Somewhat amazingly, those two tied for the lowest in that category across all quarterbacks with at least 128 attempts in 2019, which really puts into perspective the struggles this team had throwing the ball. For reference, league-leader Matthew Stafford averaged 8.3 yards through the air per completion. And it’s not just because Rudolph and Hodges were playing it safe. Eight quarterbacks averaged more intended air yards (including Drew Brees and Jimmy Garoppolo) than Hodges’ 7.2, and you have to go through eight more passes to get to Rudolph (8.0).</p>
<p><strong>35th —</strong>&nbsp;Where James Conner ranked in terms of how often he faced eight-plus defenders in the box, 13.79% of the time. Only 13 qualified backs saw a lower percentage of stacked boxes. Who ranked at the top of the league? That would be San Francisco’s Tevin Coleman (40.15%), but guess who was No. 2? Steelers rookie Benny Snell, at 39.81%. Without much of a pass-catching reputation, when Snell was in the game, opposing teams were geared up to stop the run.</p>
<p><strong>4.9 —</strong>&nbsp;Yards of cushion on average afforded to JuJu Smith-Schuster, seventh-fewest among wide receivers. That’s almost the same average cushion teams gave Antonio Brown last year when he was the Steelers’ No. 1 wideout. If you noticed a lot of opposing corners trying to jam Smith-Schuster at the line of scrimmage, the advanced metrics back it up.</p>
<p><strong>4.6 —</strong>&nbsp;While we’re on the topic of numbers that illustrate an anemic passing attack, tight end Vance McDonald’s 4.6 average air yards per target were lowest among qualified pass-catchers. Part of that is his position, but seven tight ends were above 9.0, including Hunter Henry (10.2) and Travis Kelce (9.3). Normal counting numbers can tell you McDonald wasn't much of a factor in the offense in 2019, but this takes it a step further. On the other end of the spectrum, James Washington ranked fifth in the NFL with 15.6 average targeted air yards. For better or worse, he established himself as this team’s deep threat in his second season.</p>
<p><strong>65 —</strong>&nbsp;Play-action passes for the Steelers, lowest in the NFL by 16 attempts. The 289 yards gained on those plays wasn't even half as many as the next-fewest, Miami’s 624.</p>
<p><strong>6.7 —</strong>&nbsp;Drop percentage for the Steelers, second-highest behind Buffalo. Diontae Johnson led the team with six drops. Smith-Schuster, Washington and Jaylen Samuels were credited five apiece. And, as you might’ve guessed, Donte Moncrief’s 26.7 drop percentage (four total, per Pro Football Reference) was highest among all Steelers wideouts and all NFL players targeted more than 10 times.</p>
<p><strong>246 —</strong>&nbsp;Unique lineups for the Steelers defense, fewest in the NFL. Buffalo was next with 262. As injury-plagued as they were on offense, the Steelers were much healthier on the other side of the ball, as evidenced by using just 26 players on defense all season. Only New England and Green Bay used fewer, with 25 each.</p>
<p><strong>12.74 —</strong>&nbsp;Percent of the time the Steelers used their most common defensive lineup. You've already guessed the offensive one, now see if you can nail this exact 11. The most frequent grouping was Cam Heyward, Javon Hargrave, Bud Dupree, T.J. Watt, Mark Barron, Devin Bush, Joe Haden, Minkah Fitzpatrick, Terrell Edmunds, Steven Nelson and Mike Hilton. A Vikings lineup that played 8.34% of Minnesota’s defensive snaps was closest to a reliable Steelers lineup that was as versatile as it was durable, considering they played on 66 passing downs and 65 rushing downs. But it might be worth noting that opposing offenses averaged 5.66 yards against that personnel, most among the Steelers’ eight most-used lineups. The most successful one, which allowed just 2.06 yards per play, is the same crew, just swapping Stephon Tuitt in for Hargrave — but that lineup was used just 18 times, given that Fitzpatrick and Tuitt played just three full games together.</p>
<p><strong>14 —</strong> Missed tackles for rookie linebacker Devin Bush, most on the team, according to Pro Football Reference. But it was Dupree who had the highest missed-tackle rate among the regulars, at 15% — and that wasn't even in the top 80 of qualifying defenders.</p>
<p><strong>10 —</strong> Speaking of Dupree, 10 of his 16 tackles for loss came against the run, tied for Aaron Donald atop the NFL. And speaking of Bush, his 44 tackles on running plays were tied for eighth in the league.</p>
<p><strong>1st —&nbsp;</strong>The Steelers defense’s rank in turnover percentage. Opponents’ drives ended in a turnover 19.8% of the time, more than two full points higher than Minnesota, which ranked second with 17.7%. That was the highest turnover percentage by a team in an NFL season since Chicago and New England surpassed 20% in 2012, per Pro Football Reference. The Steelers also ranked fourth with 29.4% of opponents’ drives ending in a score. Talk about two statistics that define how strong this defense was.</p>
