<h1>Allegheny County asks for extended suspension of federal civil cases because of virus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County has asked for an extension of a federal court order temporarily suspending civil cases involving county departments that are working through the COVID-19 crisis because they have been deemed essential.</p>
<p>Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak last month granted a motion by the county to stay all civil cases involving the county for one month so that county lawyers and employees can focus on virus-related issues.</p>
<p>The order affected about 30 federal civil rights and employment lawsuits in which the county or its employees are defendants.</p>
<p>The county on Wednesday asked for an extension of that order for 15 of the 30 cases and one new one.</p>
<p>The 16 cases involve the jail, the 911 center and Children, Youth and Families.</p>
<p>All of those departments have been deemed essential during the crisis and are required to focus their manpower and resources on dealing with the virus and fulfill their obligations to the populations they serve, the county said.</p>
<p>The jail is trying to stop the virus from spreading inside the facility and needs to focus on that, county lawyers said. Similarly, CYF employees are responding to ChildLine calls, doing investigations and dealing with increases in abusive situations. And the 911 center is handling an increase in emergency calls related to COVID-19 in addition to other calls.</p>
<p>"All three departments are required to operate 24/7 and continue to have to perform all of their other mandatory obligations while adding to their work the complexities presented by COVID-19," the county's motion said.</p>
<p>The law department said it is also being taxed to address employee-related legal issues related to the virus as well as the delayed state primary election.</p>
<p>The motion asks that Judge Hornak hold the 16 cases in abeyance for another month.</p>
