<h1>For first time in more than a decade, TSA to allow larger bottles of hand sanitizer on planes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For nearly 14 years, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration has barred travelers from bringing more than 3.4 ounces of liquids like shampoo, body wash, and mouthwash onto airplanes. But now it is making an exception — for hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>As concerns over COVID-19 escalate, the TSA is permitting airline passengers to bring up to 12 ounces of sanitizer in their carry-on bags until further notice. That’s nearly four times the amount of liquid that travelers normally are allowed to take on planes.</p>
<p>In 2006, the limit was instituted following a plot to attack planes leaving Heathrow Airport in London using liquid bombs hidden in sports-drink bottles.</p>
<p>In a release, the TSA cautioned that bottles of hand sanitizer will be screened separately from other items, meaning that it could increase the time spent at the security checkpoint.</p>
<p>But the bigger challenge may be finding hand sanitizer, given that many stores are sold out.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh International Airport, meanwhile, has installed hand sanitizing stations at about 30 locations in its landside and airside buildings.</p>
<p>It also has intensified cleaning routines in restrooms and other common areas and cleaning frequencies at high touch-point areas like handrails, elevator buttons, door handles, tables, and chair. On the tram, it is cleaning hold bars, railings and other areas more frequently.</p>
