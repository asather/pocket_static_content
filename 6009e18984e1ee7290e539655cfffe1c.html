<h1>Peduto: City's health plans will cover in vitro fertilization in 2021</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto’s office announced Wednesday that the city will offer fertility coverage for the first time to its employees.</p>
<p>Starting in 2021, the city will offer two cycles of in vitro fertilization for employees covered under its health plans.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the city will pay the healthcare costs in full, and employee monthly insurance contributions for those using the benefit will not increase.</p>
<p>The benefit will be offered to all employee groups that are part of the Municipal Healthcare Group, according to a statement.</p>
<p>“The City of Pittsburgh is a welcoming place to work, where we are always looking to improve the quality of life for our employees and their families,” Mayor Peduto said in the release.</p>
<p>The latest announcement comes nearly three years after the city began covering employees seeking gender affirmation surgery.</p>
<p>Although there isn’t yet an estimate on number of requests for either item, Tim McNulty, the mayor’s spokesman, said both have been asked for by employees.</p>
<p>“We're constantly in talks with our many unions about employee healthcare needs.” Mr. McNulty said.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the new policy means that Pittsburgh will be one of only a few cities in the country that offers coverage for both fertility treatments and gender affirmation surgery.</p>
