<h1>Car strikes tree in Fayette County, killing two</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two people died in a single-vehicle crash in Fayette County early Saturday morning when their car lost control and struck a tree.</p>
<p>The accident occurred around 2 a.m. in Redstone.</p>
<p>The Fayette County coroner identified the driver as Miranda Huseman, 27, and the front-seat passenger as Daniel A. Guthrie, 32. Both were from the Fayette County area, Coroner Phillip E. Reilly said.</p>
<p>Ms. Huseman was driving a Honda Fit along Filbert-Orient Road when she lost control due to a&nbsp;“significant speed factor,” according to Dr. Reilly.</p>
<p>The car scraped against a wall that runs alongside the road and then hit a tree, causing&nbsp;“massive destruction” and ejecting Ms. Huseman.</p>
<p>Mr. Guthrie was partially entrapped.</p>
<p>Neither victim wore a seatbelt, Dr. Reilly said.</p>
<p>Mr. Guthrie was pronounced dead at the scene at 3:15 a.m.; Ms. Huseman was pronounced there 15 minutes later.</p>
<p>Dr. Reilly did not know the relationship between the victims.</p>
<p>Redstone police were investigating. No one from the department could be reached for comment.</p>
