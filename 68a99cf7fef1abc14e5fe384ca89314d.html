<h1>Despite record, Ben Cherington and Derek Shelton express belief in this year's Pirates players</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the general manager of a Pirates team that is nowhere near competing, with players struggling to get their games going in the right direction, Ben Cherington is in a strange spot right now.</p>
<p>There are certainly holes on his team. If there weren’t, they would have won more games by this point in the season.</p>
<p>At the same time, there isn’t obvious help on the horizon, this season or offseason. The Pirates aren’t in a place where they are going to trade for big names at the deadline or sign them when the season is over. Some of their top prospects could arrive this season or next, but many are a couple years away.</p>
<p>With all of that, yes, this season has been bad, but Cherington isn’t about to give up on any one of his players. Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t, but he doesn’t let on that he does.</p>
<p>On Friday, he spoke to his belief in the players the Pirates have run out onto the field this season, despite the lackluster start they’ve collectively experienced.</p>
<p>“There are players on this team right now who are going to be part of this team when we’re good. I really do believe that. It doesn’t mean it’s a guarantee, but that’s what I believe,” Cherington said.</p>
<p>He went on to acknowledge that the Pirates need more organizational depth and an infusion of talent. That and development of current players are not mutually exclusive, though.</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton is in a similar position to Cherington, though it isn’t exactly the same. His job has everything to do with believing in his players, to create the ideal clubhouse environment for each of them to succeed.</p>
<p>For both Cherington and Shelton, belief in their players is not limited to the younger ones. For instance, the longest-tenured Pirate, right fielder Gregory Polanco, has had a truly terrible season. He missed the beginning of it after testing positive for COVID-19, and entered Friday’s game hitting .070.</p>
<p>That can be frustrating to watch, and it’s frustrating for Polanco to experience. The Pirates have invested a heck of a lot into Polanco, though, and they still believe he can turn into the everyday right fielder that people thought he could be when he debuted back in 2014.</p>
<p>“Polanco is coming. It’s going to be there. This kid is way too talented,” Shelton said Friday. “He’s healthy, which is way more important than anything else. The fact that he's continued to be probably as good a teammate as you could ask for, being the longest-tenured Pirate here, being someone that buys into what we're doing … I understand the strikeouts are there. But if you're asking me, I'm taking Gregory Polanco every day and I'm taking the way he is in our clubhouse every day. He'll continue to bust his ass and it's gonna come with him.”</p>
<p>What both Cherington and Shelton can point to as a reason for their optimism is how relatively few games the Pirates have played — barely more than 20.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, that is nothing. In this season, it’s more than one-third of it. The team failures have made the possibility of any meaningful success this season unlikely.</p>
<p>For the two people in charge, though, it’s reason to look at the bright side, and not only with Polanco. That may sound too sunshine-and-roses for the product on the field, but Cherington and Shelton have given very little indication thus far that they don’t believe it.</p>
<p>“However we were valuing players in the middle of July, I don't think it changed that much after 21 games,” Cherington said. “So if we have players who are performing below what we expect them to be performing at, and that doesn't mean that's going to continue, 21 games is a short amount of time, and so I don't think that changes their valuation on those players to any degree.”</p>
<p>Added Shelton: “If this was a 21-game stretch in a 162-game season, you'd be like, ‘Hey, we’re scuffling a little bit,’ ” Shelton said. “When it's a 60-game season and it's 21 games, it's like, ‘Oh, my God. The world's gonna end.’ The world's not going to end.”</p>
