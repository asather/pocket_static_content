<h1>Pirates takeaways: Is any development happening here?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What are the Pirates right now?</p>
<p>And don’t say, “Terrible.” That’s a low blow the morning after they lost to replay review, 6-3, in 10 innings when Indians first baseman Carlos Santana hit a three-run foul ball that landed on the left-field rotunda.</p>
<p>But seriously, what are we doing here? And apologies for getting overly philosophical.</p>
<p>At 4-15, the Pirates certainly aren’t competing for anything, unless we’re talking about presumptive No. 1 overall pick Kumar Rocker or avoiding the worst winning percentage in franchise history. It’s also hard to determine whether they’ve taken any meaningful steps forward in terms of fundamentals or on-field play.</p>
<p>Just a few of the latest examples:</p>
<p>• Adam Frazier and Kevin Newman either failing to get bunts down or, in Newman’s case, doing so ineffectively. They were also curious decisions to call them — Newman because he’s actually been hitting the ball well, and Frazier because Jarrod Dyson would’ve likely scored on a single from second in the ninth inning.</p>
<p>• Dyson, a 36-year-old veteran, also can’t get picked off there. He just can’t. And he knows that.</p>
<p>• The Pirates made three more errors Tuesday and another baserunning blunder. They remain one of the worst fielding teams in MLB and have hardly looked adept at running the bases.</p>
<p>But the more curious situation here is big-picture. If the Pirates are using this year as a transition year or building for the future, even if management won't outright say it, why are we worrying so much about the present?</p>
<p>One example: Gregory Polanco is hitting .075, and he’s playing most days in right field. Talk about exit velocity, his hustle or positive attitude all you want. It’s still .075. For an everyday player.</p>
<p>In the 10th inning Tuesday, manager Derek Shelton said he never considered having Jose Osuna pinch-hit. Never mind the fact that Osuna led the National League in pinch-hit home runs last season; he’s been mostly a ghost in 2020.</p>
<p>Dyson is hitting .143, and he, too, is getting chance after chance. Could Jason Martin or Jared Oliva really be that much worse? What about simply spending the reps on Cole Tucker?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as other top prospects around baseball have been promoted, Ke’Bryan Hayes remains in Altoona. Sure, Erik Gonzalez came into this one hitting .452 over his previous eight games, but it’s not like that has helped fuel some sort of surge. The Pirates have still lost 15 of 19.</p>
<p>At 28, Gonzalez also can’t possibly be part of their long-term plans.</p>
<p>Losing with prospects at least has some benefit. Losing with guys who seem to have no long-term future with your club just seems … like a Band-Aid on a pretty large cut.</p>
<p>And that’s without delving into the bullpen situation. The Pirates on Tuesday used Derek Holland there, which may actually have been a smart move. Perhaps an opposing team could scoop him up at the trade deadline.</p>
<p>But where’s Blake Cederlind? Or even Tyler Bashlor, the kid from the Mets they promoted before the game? Anybody who would stand to benefit from some opportunity the major league club has to offer right now.</p>
<p>It’s not just that the Pirates are losing. It has to be frustrating for fans that they don’t even seem to be doing that in a constructive way.</p>
<p><strong>Brubaker lacks ‘crispness’</strong></p>
<p>After a couple of really impressive outings to start his MLB career, JT Brubaker’s past couple of appearances have lacked the same effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p>It was another so-so outing from Brubaker, who performed similarly in his first MLB start Aug. 6 against the Twins. In both games, Brubaker allowed three runs over three innings and did not enjoy a single 1-2-3 inning. A big issue has been his control and the lack of willingness to go right at hitters.</p>
<p>While he had a solid MLB debut (two scoreless innings on July 26) and was outstanding again Aug. 1 at Wrigley Field, the past two outings for Brubaker have been average at best.</p>
<p>And even though the Pirates can probably afford to let Brubaker learn on the job because they lack pitching depth, he hasn’t done much to seize an opportunity.</p>
<p>"I felt good," Brubaker said. "The stuff wasn't quite there. The crispness of my stuff wasn't quite there. You go from throwing bullpens here and there throughout the time off where everything is feeling good, and then you get into a higher intensity atmosphere and it just kind of isn't there. It’s just not having that consistent reps and that game-like atmosphere."</p>
<p><strong>Holland wants video</strong></p>
<p>Holland didn't like what he saw in the bullpen, which, apparently, was not very much.</p>
<p>Holland was critical of Major League Baseball and how little live video it is allowing players to see this season, saying it's not enough for relievers to be adequately prepared.</p>
<p>"They’ve changed so much with how the cameras are in the clubhouse; we don't get anything," Holland said. "It’s [not ideal]. We don't get to see anything. It kind of [stinks] for those guys, preparing and everything.</p>
<p>"When we were in Wrigley, [relievers] can't even see anything at all. I’m not trying to be a [jerk] by any means, but … guys [have] got to be able to see something of what's going on with the game.</p>
<p>“These guys can see the field, but we also want to see what's going on at the plate as well and get a feel for an umpire’s zone.”</p>
<p>Holland has a point, although it's not the same sort of video-related concern many will be discussing after Tuesday's game.</p>
