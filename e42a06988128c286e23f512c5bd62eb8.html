<h1>Fighting overdoses: Allegheny County receives fewer Narcan kits this year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County saw a dramatic drop in the number of drug overdose deaths in 2018, thanks in large part to the distribution of free naloxone kits provided by the state. Reducing the number of those overdose-reversal kits, as proposed for this year, threatens to undo the progress made in stemming drug deaths.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency has distributed free Narcan — the nasal form of naloxone — to governments statewide since November 2017. The kits are then given to first-responders and agencies dealing with those at high risk of overdosing.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department received 2,976 kits, containing two doses each, for the fiscal year ending mid-2018, and 10,176 kits for the year ending mid-2019.</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves. Accidental overdose fatalities dropped 41% percent from 2017 to 2018 — from 737 deaths to 432 — coinciding with the increased availability of Narcan. The decline in Allegheny County far outpaced the statewide drop, where overdose deaths fell by 18%.</p>
<p>For the current fiscal year, unfortunately, Allegheny County is scheduled to receive only 2,268 kits, nearly 8,000 fewer than a year earlier. Two factors are in play: A commission official said funding for the Narcan program fell from $2.5 million to $1.5 million, and part of the commission’s criteria for distributing the kits is tied to the change in overdose deaths.</p>
<p>Fewer overdose deaths is not an indicator that the tide has turned in fighting the opioid crisis. If anything, it should be regarded as proof that the Narcan kits save lives, giving those affected a second chance.</p>
<p>The reduction recently dropped the county Health Department’s supply to 246 kits, about a 10-day supply from the nearly 770 that are distributed monthly. The department is looking to tap some federal funding to make up the difference.</p>
<p>County jail officials faced a similar dilemma and opted to use $75,000 from the Inmate Welfare Fund to provide Narcan kits to inmates being released.</p>
<p>The proof is in the numbers: Narcan saves lives. Reducing the number of kits available to Allegheny County compromises the Health Department’s ability to protect those at risk. State officials should reconsider the reductions and find a way to increase the Narcan supply for the county.</p>
