<p>Maybe you’ve finally punched your last time card and are ready to settle into the golden years. Or maybe people keep asking you when you are going to retire. We want to hear what life is like for those of you who have been able to move into the post-career world, and why others of you are still showing up for a paycheck long after you officially became eligible for Medicare.</p>
<p>What does your own personal retirement party look like? Are you shopping differently? Do you see the financial markets in a new way? Does your volunteer work seem more fulfilling than your career? Or are you still working to stave off boredom — or pay some bills?</p>
<p>Share your stories with us at <b>412-256-8433</b>. Leave your name, where you’re from and what your retirement experience has been like. We will take the recordings and post them on the Post-Gazette website in a feature called The Retirement Party.</p>
