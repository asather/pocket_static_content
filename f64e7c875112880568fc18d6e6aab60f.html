<h1>Steelers mailbag: Is Thursday Night Football still a good idea for the NFL?</h1>

<p><em>Welcome to Brian Batko’s Steelers mailbag. You’re more than welcome to email him at bbatko@post-gazette.com, tweet him @BrianBatko or slide into his DMs to inquire about the Steelers, NFL or anything out of bounds. </em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started, and don’t forget to join us on our all-sports podcast, <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="_blank">The North Shore Drive</a>, whether you use Apple, Spotify or any of the other major podcasting platforms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Bobby from Cincy:</strong> I am very surprised that NFL hasn't come out and canceled Thursday Night Football this year. I know they want as much prime time as possible, but with COVID, doesn't it make it a lot easier for teams to manage possible outbreaks if they know they could potentially "bubble" Friday, Saturday, Sunday to ensure everybody that steps on the field for game day is absolutely positively virus free?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> That’s a reasonable point to make, Bobby, but it would seem that the NFL is putting faith in its current COVID-19 protocols to be the primary method of avoiding outbreaks. And so far, based on the statistics being released, it’s hard to blame the league for that.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/NFL-COVID-19-MONITORING-TESTING-RESULTS.aspx" target="_blank">latest numbers indicate</a> that 58,397 tests were administered to 8,573 players and personnel from Aug. 12 through Aug. 20. There were six new confirmed positive results, but all six were to personnel other than players. Which means zero positives for players, also known as the people most crucial to making games happen whether it’s a Thursday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday.</p>
<p>To me, if the league has to harbor extra concerns about players engaging in high-risk behavior between Friday practice and kickoff, they’ll have bigger issues than Thursday night games. Not to mention many players and coaches, Steelers organization included, have expressed little interest in any sort of bubble for themselves this season. Teams such as the Buccaneers, Cowboys and Saints have implemented ideas labeled as “soft” bubbles or “voluntary” bubbles or “sequesters,” but Mike Tomlin and players have been asked whether the Steelers considered anything like that, and the answers seems to be no.</p>
<p>“We felt like we could create a good situation here at Heinz Field, a lot of room to spread people out,” team president Art Rooney II said before practice Saturday night. “So far, I think it’s worked pretty well.”</p>
<p>Rooney, as influential an owner as there is in the sport, also added that the NFL never seriously discussed a league-wide bubble, to his knowledge.</p>
<p>“The logistics of that were going to be difficult to manage,” Rooney said. “The players’ association was never very enthusiastic about that, so no, we never really talked about a bubble like the NHL and NBA are doing.”</p>
<p><strong>William C. Brown in Des Moines, Iowa:</strong> I enjoy your question-and-answer questions very much, so thanks for doing them.</p>
<p>Now, as far as Heyward's contract situation. I just don't see the need for people to keep asking the same questions, worded differently and expecting a different answer.</p>
<p>I personally thought they should have re-signed Hargrave, but the team just could not match what other teams were offering, so he decided to sign elsewhere.</p>
<p>Just like injuries are a part of the NFL game, so are players seeking to maximize their earnings potential. If Heyward seeks to maximize his potential and it happens to not be with the Steelers, the fans should not be upset about it because that's just how it is. Loyalty is something that goes both ways. He want's to play for the Steelers and the Steelers would like to keep him, but it must work both ways.</p>
<p>The advent of free agency has made it possible for players to do that. If a company offers you more money to relocate and it offers you more opportunities and a better quality of life for yourself and your family, would you not take that opportunity?</p>
<p>Yes, I know all the other intangible and reasons why it may make sense to stay, but there are times when the opportunities are just too important and lucrative to pass up. Heyward indicated he will give his all to this year and hopefully the team wins it all, and let the off season play itself out.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, fans worry about things they have no need to worry about. It makes for good conversations I guess, but why worry about something, until there is something to worry about?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Because it gives dopes like me something to write about.</p>
<p><strong>Big Ed Barr:</strong> Hey Brian! Any word on how Chris Boswell is doing in camp?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Funny you ask, Big Ed, because I was just saying last week at practice to some colleagues how nice it is that we don't have to cover a kicking competition this year. It was just last season in Latrobe that we were charting every attempt by Boswell and the undrafted rookie — quick, who was it? (answer at the bottom of the story) — because No. 9 was on shaky ground after a miserable 2018.</p>
<p>So, admittedly, it’s not being monitored quite as closely this camp, but there seems to be no reason to believe Boswell isn't picking up where he left off after a stellar bounce-back in 2019 with just three misses.</p>
<p><strong>Alan S.:</strong> Hi there. Something that’s not being talked about much: Last year, the Steelers famously bucked tradition and gave coach Tomlin a one-year contract extension vs. the customary two-year deal and that was seen as a challenge after missing the playoffs after a 7-2 start to the 2018 season. This past year, the coach got tons of praise locally and nationally, even with a three-game skid to end the season. I know Mr. Rooney spoke well of him recently, but if it was a challenge, and if it’s believed that Tomlin proved himself again, shouldn’t there be a lot of speculation about an extension this offseason?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Not so much, Alan, because Tomlin is still under contract through the 2021 season. Which means this will be more of a story line again next summer, with fans, reporters, et al asking, “Will they or won't they?” and “Would they or should they?”</p>
<p>There is the added factor of the team also having an option year for the 2022 season, as well, so we could even avoid the discussion next year, too. But here’s the thing: If the Steelers miss the playoffs for a third straight season, we’re going to be talking about Tomlin’s job status anyway, regardless of his contract status.</p>
<p><strong>Michael P.:</strong> Lots of people are raving about how good Claypool has been in camp. Lots of people also raved about how good Washington looked in past camps, and he's been ok-to-good in games. So I'm curious if Claypool is looking even better than Washington looked in past camps so I can go ahead and figure out at what level to temper my expectations. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well, I wasn't covering the team James Washington’s rookie year, but what can I do is post these two quotes side by side. From training camp in 2018, Aug. 12, to be exact:</p>
<p>Ben Roethlisberger on Washington: “I know early in camp we were talking about how he couldn’t even get on the field with me. Now we’re asking for him to be on the field so he can get some reps, so we can see what he can do.”</p>
<p>And now, Roethlisberger this morning, Aug. 27, 2020:</p>
<p>Roethlisberger on Claypool: “I always get caught trying to spread too much praise to a rookie because I want them to sneak up on other people, but it doesn't look like Chase is going to be able to sneak up on anybody right now because people are talking about him, and deservedly so. He’s just making plays. The plays he’s making are impressive, but to me, what’s more impressive is that he’s not asking a lot of questions, which means he knows his stuff.”</p>
<p>You can be the judge of what that does for your expectations, considering the Steelers have actually had fewer live practices to this point than they would in a normal year.</p>
<p><strong>@rrwinn:</strong> do the "cotton candy" grapes taste like cotton candy to you? I just taste grapes</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yes, they do, and they are delicious. By far my favorite breed of grapes now. The only negative is how expensive they are, but sometimes you just have to treat yourself.</p>
