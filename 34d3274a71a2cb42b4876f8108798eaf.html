<h1>President signs order to combat price gouging, hoarding key supplies</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>President Donald&nbsp;Trump signed an executive order to keep people and businesses from hoarding supplies needed in the fight against the novel coronavirus, and from engaging in price gouging.</p>
<p>Attorney General William Barr recently directed federal prosecutors across the country to prioritize fraud schemes related to the pandemic and to prosecute offenders.</p>
<p>“If you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house, this is not something you have to worry about,” Mr. Barr said at the White House briefing. “But If you are sitting on a warehouse full of surgical masks, you will be hearing a knock on your door.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, the department filed its first civil complaint against the operators of a sham website that sold fake vaccine kits that the site falsely claimed came from the World Health Organization. A federal district court judge in Texas issued a temporary restraining order and demanded that the owners block access to the site, <a href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcoronavirusmedicalkit.com" rel="nofollow">coronavirusmedicalkit.com</a>.</p>
<p>There is currently no vaccine for the novel coronavirus, and the World Health Organization is not distributing any such vaccine.</p>
<p>The operators of the website were accused of wire fraud in seeking to profit from the confusion and fear that has been unleashed by the pandemic. Federal prosecutors are still investigating the website and its operators.</p>
