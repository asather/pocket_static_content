<h1>Pirates' Mitch Keller: Earning third spot in starting rotation is 'a huge honor'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the Pirates’ intrasquad scrimmage Tuesday, right-hander Mitch Keller threw five innings against his teammates.&nbsp;He struggled in the second inning a little before settling down and stringing together a few 1-2-3 innings to end the scrimmage.</p>
<p>Keller then went into the clubhouse, where manager Derek Shelton called him into his office. There, Shelton told Keller that the right-hander had made the Pirates’ starting rotation and will start the third game of the season, against the St. Louis Cardinals this Sunday.</p>
<p>“I just got a big smile on my face,” Keller said Wednesday. “I was super happy when he told me and just really excited to get going. Yeah, it was a really good moment.”</p>
<p>The news doesn’t come as a surprise. Keller was always likely to make the starting rotation, even if it wasn’t clear exactly into which slot he would fit.</p>
<p>After all, the 24-year-old has been one of the Pirates’ top prospects for years now. He’s pitched well in Class AAA Indianapolis already, and though his experience in the majors last year wasn’t quite up to the level he wanted, it is still the only level at which he has something to prove.</p>
<p>In short, he and the Pirates feel he’s ready, so he’s here, starting the season in the middle of the Pirates’ rotation.</p>
<p>“You really think about it, there’s five starters per team and I’ve got one of the spots on one of the teams. It’s a huge honor,” Keller said. “I’m just super grateful. I’m excited to get going for this opportunity. It’s just a testament of how hard I’ve worked this offseason, how hard I’ve worked just trying to get to this spot. I’m excited for it.”</p>
<p>That work Keller mentioned has been with pitching coach Oscar Marin and bullpen coach Justin Meccage.</p>
<p>Marin said earlier this month that much of his coaching has been spent helping Keller understand exactly which pitches work best in different areas of the strike zone — like working on fastballs up in the zone more frequently.</p>
<p>That eye toward pitch usage has developed further as summer camp has gone on. Keller’s buildup to the season has seemed to be a slower one than some of the Pirates’ other starting pitchers, throwing a few innings in intrasquad scrimmages here and there.</p>
<p>Tuesday, then, was ostensibly his last live pitching before the season begins in St. Louis. Shelton’s takeaway from it wasn’t necessarily that Keller gave up some hits or runs or struck out a few batters. It was more with the way he was mixing his pitches and using them the way Marin wants.</p>
<p>“I think Oscar and [Meccage] have done a really nice job with him. I think today we saw him use all of his pitches,” Shelton said Tuesday. “We saw the slider later in the outing become really effective. The ability to locate the fastball was sharper today. This is a young kid who’s going to continue to grow into his stuff. I’m very happy with the pitching group that we have around him to try and help him develop.”</p>
<p>With that, it would stand to reason that Keller’s progress could be slow and steady as the season continues.</p>
<p>His goal isn’t to be perfect. It’s more to learn from his time in the majors last season, when he experienced some good outings with some really tough ones. For Keller, 2020 is about proving himself, yes, which means trusting the work he has put in with Marin and Meccage and achieving more consistent success throughout the campaign.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to even out those waves there and make it a little more consistent this year,” Keller said. “I think I’m in a really good spot for that.”</p>
