<h1>'SCO' gang member gets nine years for drug-dealing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A gang member from Braddock is headed to federal prison for nine years for his role in narcotics trafficking.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Arthur Schwab on Thursday sentenced Jaymare Jackson, 30, to that term followed by four years of probation.</p>
<p>Jackson was a member of the SCO gang in Braddock that the FBI and its partners in the Greater Pittsburgh Safe Streets Task Force dismantled following a wiretap investigation. He and 32 others, including ringleader Howard McFadden, were indicted in June 2019.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebecca Silinski said in sentencing papers that Jackson was repeatedly intercepted on wiretaps communicating with McFadden and other members of the ring. Social media posts by the gang members also confirmed Jackson's affiliation with SCO, she said. During one video on Instagram, for example, he, McFadden and another member, James Wells, are sitting in a vehicle discussing plans for the weekend and Jackson repeatedly refers to an "SCO party."</p>
<p>On June 12, 2019, the day law officers swept in to make mass arrests of the SCO members, agents and police executed a search warrant at a residence in East Pittsburgh where Jackson was known to stay and seized two guns. Jackson can't have guns because he's a felon. Next to the nightstand, officers also seized stamp bags of heroin.</p>
<p>McFadden, the SCO leader, pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy to distribute heroin, cocaine and crack cocaine.</p>
<p>He is awaiting sentencing.</p>
