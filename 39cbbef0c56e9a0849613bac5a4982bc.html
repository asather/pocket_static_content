<p>MONONGALIA COUNTY, W.Va. — At least nine people were charged Thursday evening as police used tear gas to dismantle a crowd of defiant party goers in a neighborhood outside West Virginia University’s campus.</p>
<p>Officers with the Morgantown Police Department responded around 5:46 p.m. to Beverly Avenue between 4th and 5th Streets — minutes away from campus — to reports that a large party had shut down part of Beverly Avenue, police said.</p>
<p>Authorities said people threw beer bottles, beer cans and other things at them as they went door knocking in an attempt to direct people away from the area. More than 1,000 people were “blocking the street, congregating on rooftops, consuming alcohol,” according to Eric Powell, deputy chief of the Morgantown Police Department.</p>
<p>After requesting backup, police tried asking people to leave using a loudspeaker, which only made matters worse. The crowd continued to grow and people kept throwing items at police, officials said.&nbsp;West Virginia University Police and other assisting agencies helped restrict access to the area, while emergency personnel stood nearby.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scene calmed nearly three hours after police arrived. Authorities used smoke grenades that were initially “ineffective at dispersing the crowd,” officials said. Three rounds of tear gas were eventually thrown, proving more successful, police said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police are continuing their investigation in viewing body camera footage and surveillance video in the incident.&nbsp;Additional criminal charges could emerge in the future, Chief Powell said.</p>
<p>Those charged include:&nbsp;Connor Burow, 21, of Fairfax, Va. (nuisance party, failure to maintain a litter free premise, public intoxication);&nbsp;Colin McHugh, 19, of Pilesgrove, N.J. (charged with disorderly conduct and underage consumption);&nbsp;Joseph Boggs, 27, of Morgantown, W.V. (charged with public intoxication);&nbsp;Syndenee Wunts, 21, of Morgantown, (nuisance party);&nbsp;Sarah Hogan, 21,of Woodbridge, Va. (nuisance party);&nbsp;Jakob Goshen, 20, of Bloomsbury, N.J. (obstruction, disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and underage possession and consumption);&nbsp;Cameron Pierce, 20, of Weirton, W.V. (public intoxication, underage consumption and disorderly conduct);&nbsp;Cole Cailor, 19, of Beaver Falls, Pa. (public intoxication, underage consumption, disorderly conduct and destruction of property);&nbsp;Joshua Love, 21, of Fairfax, Va. (nuisance party and failure to maintain a litter free premise).</p>
