<h1>Longtime MLB manager Art Howe released from hospital after COVID-19 scare</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Former MLB player and manager Art Howe was able to leave a Houston hospital on Sunday after a nearly week-long intensive-care stay because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Relief, back in my own bedroom, it’s just sweet,” Howe, 73, told reporters. “It was a long five days or so. I’m finally feeling a little bit better. Still not able to eat real good, taste buds are giving me a hard time. It’s just nice to be back home and hopefully continue to progress.”</p>
<p>Howe, who will remain in isolation at home for a few weeks, said last week that he began experiencing symptoms on May 3, including chills that made his whole body shake “like a leaf,” fatigue he described as “total” and a loss of his sense of taste.</p>
<p>“That’s the thing. My taste buds still aren’t there. I know I should eat but nothing at all makes you want to eat,” he told KPRC-TV last week as he made his recovery in the ICU.</p>
<p>Howe, a Pittsburgh native, played 11 MLB seasons with the Pirates, Astros and Cardinals between 1974 and 1985 before becoming a manager. He led the “Moneyball” Oakland Athletics to three straight American League playoff appearances between 2000 and 2002 before finishing his managerial career with the New York Mets.</p>
<p>Regarded as one of the sport’s nicest people, Howe was cheered to health by a number of MLB employees and reporters.</p>
