<h1>With water temps dropping, catch early steelhead in the ‘surf zone’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A lot of anglers love the idea of 20-some inches of muscle tail-walking at the end of the line. But imagining themselves knee-deep in 33-degree flow during a November freeze quickly puts an end to those steelhead dreams.</p>
<p>With a shift in tactics, however, any steelheader with a spinning rod or fly gear can experience tight lines long before the temperature plunges.</p>
<p>Karl Weixlmann has been bringing steelhead to shore since mid-September. The Erie County author of “Great Lakes Steelhead, Salmon and Trout” (Headwater, $28.18), and contributor to “Keystone Fly Fishing: The Ultimate Guide to Pennsylvania's Best Waters” (Headwater, $29.95), Mr. Weixlmann has been steelheading in the “surf zone.”</p>
<p>In late summer and early autumn, the air temperature may be in the 70s when dropping water temperatures trigger steelhead to gather off the tribs anticipating a big rain event that pushes the familiar scents of their post-natal streams through the creek mouths. Before the first runs, Mr. Weixlmann wades into the surf at points where the circling routes of steelhead swing within casting distance of the shoreline.</p>
<p>“Right now the water temperature is 67, a little warm,” said Mr. Weixlmann last week. “To me, it’s kind of a late start -- it should be 66 this time of year.”</p>
<p>Surf zone spin fishing anglers cast green and white Little Cleo spoons and spinners. A fly fisherman, Mr. Weixlmann relies on his Little Precious, a pattern he sometimes ties on point-up Clouser-style hooks with dumbbell eyes.</p>
<p>“I call it an Upside Down Little Precious,” he said. “It strips in better that way. Sometimes I fish Little Precious under a strike indicator to take advantage of the wave action.”</p>
<p>Steelhead circling routes, and spots where the fish swim within a long cast from shore, change with the wind. The trick, said Mr. Weixlmann, is to understand how Lake Erie winds and waves will impact tributary plumes.</p>
<p>When a steelhead strikes a fly or lure presented from the surf zone, get ready. They make a beeline to Canada and the fights can be thrilling.</p>
<p>More Weixlmann wisdom: Much of the Erie County shoreline is privately owned, and some beaches are posted with No Trespassing signs. They may own the beach, but they can’t own the water. Lake Erie is a navigable waterway, which in Pennsylvania means it is owned by the public to the high water mark. Remain at least ankle-deep in the water and you’re legal.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday hunting</strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania state Sen. Dan Laughlin, R-Erie, was presented the 2019 State Legislator of the Year Award for doing much of the heavy lifting required to legalize three days of Sunday hunting in Pennsylvania. Presented by Safari Club International Sept. 22, the award recognizes Mr. Laughlin’s leadership as chairman of the Senate Game and Fisheries Committee and bill sponsor during the repeal of one of the state’s last Blue Laws. Hunting on Sunday in Pennsylvania had been illegal since British rule of Penn’s Woods colony.</p>
<p>Also last month, the Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen and Conservationists lauded state Sen. Jim Brewster, D-Allegheny, as Legislator of the Year for the same accomplishment. Mr. Brewster cosponsored the Sunday hunting bill and was Democratic chair of the Senate Game and Fisheries Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to fly fish</strong></p>
<p>The Community College of Allegheny County cancelld its spring fly tying course as a COVID-19 precaution. In autumn, the classes are back. An Intermediate Fly Fishing Course begins Oct. 13, and clinics on Tying Great Lakes Steelhead Flies are scheduled for Oct. 21 and 31.
