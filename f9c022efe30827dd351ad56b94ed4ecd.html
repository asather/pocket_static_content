<h1>LifeX to offer new lab space in Lawrenceville</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Startup biotech companies will soon have access to new lab space for research and product development.</p>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh’s LifeX Labs will offer nearly 5,000 square feet of wet lab space in Lawrenceville to support the research efforts of companies developing drugs, medical diagnostics and precision medicines. The new space, which can accommodate up to 20 companies at a time, will complement LifeX’s existing office space in the Southside Works.</p>
<p>The new labs, which open June 1 in the Chocolate Factory, will be part of the Regional Industrial Development Corp’s Lawrenceville Technology Center.</p>
<p>“We see commercialization of university research as the most important factor driving the region’s economic growth, so we are excited to collaborate with LifeX Labs, RIDC President Don Smith said in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Among the first tenants of the new labs will be Workers First, a LifeX portfolio company developing personal protective equipment that can neutralize acid on contact. LifeX portfolio companies are offered the opportunity to lease office and wet lab space, which is in limited supply in the city for startup companies.</p>
<p>Separately, physician-researcher Lisa Boyette has been named LifeX’s newest executive in residence.</p>
