<h1>Monmouth poll: Biden's lead over Trump narrows in Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The sizable 13-point lead that Joe Biden held over Donald Trump just six weeks ago in a poll of registered voters in Pennsylvania has since narrowed, according to a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_PA_090220/" target="_blank">new poll published Wednesday</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, the Democrat, leads 49% to 45% among registered voters in Monmouth University's latest poll -- down from a 53% to 40% advantage over Mr. Trump in Monmouth's <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_pa_071520/" target="_blank">mid-July survey</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trimming of Mr. Biden’s lead was thanks to&nbsp;“declining support for the challenger among men, voters under age 50 and voters in key swing counties,” according to the pollster. Mr. Trump was ahead among men 47% to 45% in July; he’s now up 56% to 37%. Mr. Biden led voters under 50 by 31 points in July; he’s now up by 9. In swing counties with close 2016 vote margins, Mr. Trump was trailing by 19 points in July; he’s now ahead by 2.</p>
<p>And the share of voters who say they are certain to vote for Mr. Trump jumped by four points to 40%, while the number of certain Biden voters decreased by 2 points to 43%.</p>
<p>But the poll revealed some reassuring facts for Democrats, as well. Mr. Biden’s lead among women stayed solid at 59% to 35%, and though his margins with voters of color dropped by a few points, he continues to hold a 72% to 15% advantage over Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden’s edge among voters aged 65 and above stayed wide, too, at 53% to 42%.</p>
<p>The public’s perception of the president’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, described as a&nbsp;“weak spot for the president” by the pollster, hasn’t changed much. More than half — 53% — say Mr. Trump has done a bad job, while 45% say he’s done a good job. The numbers shifted a few points in Mr. Trump’s direction in both cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gov. Tom Wolf’s handling of the virus continues to be received positively — with 62% saying he’s done a good job and 36% saying he hasn’t. Those percentages were&nbsp;67% good and 29% bad in mid-July.</p>

<p>In the generic House ballot, 48% say they’re supporting Democratic candidates in their district and 45% say they’re backing Republicans — numbers quite similar to July. But the GOP is ahead by 10 points, 50% to 40%, in Pennsylvania’s six most competitive districts, which includes the 17th that’s currently held by U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb. Democrats were ahead in those competitive districts by 5 points in July.</p>
<p>“Republican gains on the generic ballot in competitive seats should worry Democrats,” wrote poll director Patrick Murray in a statement. “Only district-level polling can tell if this is because GOP incumbents are bulking up their margins or if GOP challengers are eating into support for Democratic incumbents.”</p>
<p>In statewide races, Democrats have an advantage. Incumbent Attorney General Josh Shapiro leads by 10 points over Republican challenger Heather Heidelbaugh, incumbent Treasurer Joe Torsella is beating Republican Stacy Garrity by 5 and in the open race for auditor general, Democrat Nina Ahmad is ahead of Republican Tim DeFoor by 2.</p>
<p>The Monmouth poll was conducted in the days following the Republican National Convention — between Aug. 28 and Aug. 31 —&nbsp;and surveyed 400 registered voters. The margin of error is 4.9 percentage points.</p>
