<h1>Pa. residents can renew licenses, ID cards without new photos</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania residents renewing their driver’s license or photo ID card can do so without renewing their photo, the state Department of Transportation announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>The agency said anyone applying for renewal after May 10 can receive their new card using their existing photo. No camera cards will be issued and the customer should receive their new card within 15 days.</p>
<p>Residents who applied before May 10 will receive a photo card and must visit a photo license center. Many of the centers remain closed due to the COVID-19 virus emergency,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Using a customer’s existing photo will help limit the number of people in our driver and photo license centers, and by extension, help reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19,” Acting PennDOT Secretary Yassmin Gramian said in a news release. “This new process is not only a convenience, but it will help to keep our customers and staff safe."</p>
<p>Customers who want to renew with the new, voluntary REAL ID card can’t do that right now. They should renew with the standard card and switch to REAL ID when the state begins issuing them again.</p>
<p>Driver and vehicle online services at <a title="PennDOT website" href="http://www.dmv.pa.gov" target="_blank">www.dmv.pa.gov</a> are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and include driver's license, photo ID and vehicle registration renewals; driver-history services; changes of address; driver license and vehicle registration restoration letters; ability to pay driver license or vehicle insurance restoration fee; and driver license and photo ID duplicates. There are no additional fees for using online services.</p>
<p>Expiration dates for licenses and ID cards that have expired since March 16 have been extended through June 30. Noncommercial and ID customers can renew on line or by mail, but commercial drivers must renew by mail.</p>
