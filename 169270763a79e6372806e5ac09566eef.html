<h1>City encouraging community events limit attendance to 250, in line with green phase guidance</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto is now encouraging community events keep attendance at 250 people or under, lining up with directives under Gov. Tom Wolf’s green phase.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto’s executive order, signed Friday, rescinds his original mid-March order that limited gatherings to 50 people in order to&nbsp;slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The order language states: “subject to applicable law including, but not limited to, rights granted under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and the executive orders of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, it is the policy of the City of Pittsburgh to encourage postponement and cancellation of all community or public gatherings in excess of 250 people. Organizers of events are advised to consult guidelines of the CDC, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Health, and the Allegheny County Health Department before planning any event.”</p>
<p>City Council heard and approved the executive order Tuesday.</p>
<p>Allegheny County entered the green phase on Friday.</p>
