<h1>The Next Page: Following the death of their patriarch during the Great Depression, the McLaughlin family persevered</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Michael McLaughlin, 42, unemployed plumber’s laborer and ditch digger, sat for a time in the “bare, ramshackle” four-room house at 1722 Merriman St., South Side, that he rented for $19 a month with his wife, Mary, and nine children.</p>
<p>It was Wednesday, July 15, 1931. Rising unemployment as the Great Depression hit was sending thousands of people to bread lines, shantytowns and desperate acts. The temperature that day reached the 90s.</p>
<p>Mr. McLaughlin had been forced to turn down work from the county two days earlier because of back and chest problems, likely caused by the physical demands of his job, and because he was having a “nervous breakdown,” according to one newspaper account.</p>
<p>He had not worked in seven or eight months. The children had no shoes. There was no food in the house. The gas bill hadn’t been paid for months, so the parents couldn’t cook food even if they had any. Mr. McLaughlin had given up smoking his pipe because the family couldn’t spare the money for tobacco.</p>
<p>He and his wife had gone to the police station to ask for help, and the police were arranging an ambulance to take him to the Mayview city psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p>In his house, Mr. McLaughlin stood up and announced he was going for a walk. Catherine, 6, and Winifred, 4, followed him outside, but he ordered them back several times. The little girls came home crying.</p>
<p>Mr. McLaughlin, meanwhile, walked the few feet from Merriman to 18th Street, turned left, then walked the scant block to Dam No. 1, which projected from the street into the Monongahela River.</p>
<p>Later, a neighbor boy ran into the house with Mr. McLaughlin’s hat and the news that he had jumped into the river to his death.</p>
<p>It was a bitter end for the Irish immigrant. Though he and his wife, also from Ireland, had claimed in a census report to be able to read and write, when his wife signed his death certificate, she had drawn only a shaky “X,” which a county official had written was “her mark.”</p>
<p>Newspaper reporters took photos of the grieving family. Only some of them were home at the time.</p>
<p>Mr. McLaughlin had been so sick that his oldest child, Colman or Coleman, 16, had stayed with him while his wife took the other children to the Lillian Taylor Farm Camp in Valencia, Pa., run by the Kingsley House Association. The camp was one of many created to get impoverished city children out of the dirty, crowded areas in which they lived into fresh air and open spaces.</p>
<p>The Saturday before Mr. McLaughlin’s death, Mrs. McLaughlin and the four youngest children came home to help him.</p>
<p>In news photos, the children were shown sitting close to their mother. Only Colman knew what had just happened and his expression reflects his grief.</p>
<p>The younger children besides Catherine and Winifred were Agnes, 2, and John, 6 months. Still at camp were Mary, 13, Edward, 11, Michael, 10, and Peter, 9.</p>
<p>Edward Koontz, a Brownsville Road undertaker, promised to pay for a funeral. Father Edward J. Moriarty of St. John’s Catholic Church arranged a cemetery plot in Calvary Cemetery in Hazelwood. The funeral took place in the house.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Sticking together</strong></span></p>
<p>Although one news story stated that the family faced worse poverty and the orphan’s home, that isn’t what happened.</p>
<p>“They stayed together. Uncle Coly went to work,” said Lisa DeFilippo, 57, of Union City, Erie County, one of Agnes’ children. “They all made it through and stuck together — such a close family.”</p>
<p>How they supported themselves is not entirely clear, but the church may have contributed, and family members agree that the older children helped out. The family moved to Mount Washington and raised chickens for food.</p>
<p>After their mother’s death in 1945 from heart disease, Colman and Edward took care of their younger siblings. Neither of the oldest brothers ever married or had children. “They were busy being parents (to their younger siblings), and they ended up not thinking of themselves,” Ms. DeFilippo said.</p>
<p>According to public records, the family siblings’ adult lives were as follows.</p>
<p>In December 1950, John and his best friend, Regis W. Helch, were fighting as Marine sergeants at the Chosin Reservoir, North Korea.</p>
<p>The Korean War was a proxy war between the United States and the former Soviet Union over the spread of communism, with North Korea backed by Communist China and the Soviet Union while South Korea was supported by the United States. John and Sgt. Helch sat on one another’s feet to keep warm. On Dec. 6, Sgt. Helch got shot, and the medics couldn’t reach him. The men were outnumbered and surrounded.</p>
<p>In Sgt. Helch’s version of what happened, the next day, John left their shelter to seek help and was shot dead. In the military’s version, John braved heavy machine gun fire and grenades to run from one man to another in his rifle squad, giving instructions and encouragement.</p>
<p>The military said he was killed by a grenade. The body showed a shot through the head and a leg injury possibly from a grenade. He was posthumously awarded a Bronze Star Medal for courage.</p>
<p>John McLaughlin was buried in a mass grave in North Korea with other unknown soldiers. In 1954, in an exchange of war dead, the mass grave was exhumed and the remains reburied in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Punchbowl Crater, Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>
<p>In February 2015, the military was able to use DNA to identify John’s remains, and they were flown to Pittsburgh and buried with military honors in Calvary Cemetery. Agnes DeFilippo was the only one of his siblings still alive then.</p>
<p>“He was just a heck of a nice, young brother and always good to me and with me,” Mrs. DeFilippo told the Post-Gazette in 2015.</p>
<p>“He was larger than life,” said John Bondi, a nephew who was 6 when the sergeant shipped off. “He was a little bit of a jokester. He was always happy-go-lucky, from what I remember.”</p>
<p>Sgt. Helch celebrated a Mass for John every Dec. 7 and toasted him afterward with friends at his Veterans of Foreign Wars post. Sgt. Helch died just months before John’s body was returned to Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Colman McLaughlin died in 1993. He had been a pipe fitter and had worked for Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Co. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery.</p>
<p>Mary married Frank A. Bondi and had five children. She is buried in Washington County.</p>
<p>Edward worked with the U.S. Border Patrol between New York and Canada. He died in 1994 in Buffalo, N.Y., and is buried in Calvary Cemetery.</p>
<p>Michael married Mary Kenna and had four children. He was 46 when he died in 1967 and a member of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery.</p>
<p>Peter married Josephine Defeo and had three children. He died in 2003 and is buried in Jefferson Memorial Park in Pleasant Hills.</p>
<p>Catherine married Edward A. Coll and had one child. Some readers may remember Mr. Coll because he taught many Girl Scouts how to climb mountains, explore caves and run rivers and broke a Guinness record on rappelling. Catherine died in 2002, and it is not clear where she is buried.</p>
<p>Winifred married Walter C. Wetzel Sr. and had eight children. She died in 2009 and is buried in Calvary Cemetery.</p>
<p>Agnes married Joseph F. DeFilippo and had four children. She was the last of the nine children to die, in 2018, and is buried in Calvary. Her obituary listing at Slater Funeral Service’s website states that she “loved to spend time with her family, cook, bake and collect recipes.”</p>
