<h1>Penn Hills' Dan DeRose expected to be North Allegheny's new boys basketball coach</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dan DeRose enjoyed plenty of success in his five years as boys basketball coach at Penn Hills High School. North Allegheny hopes that success travels.</p>
<p>DeRose is going from the eastern suburbs to the north. He is expected to be named North Allegheny’s new coach. DeRose is the recommended candidate for the North Allegheny school board to hire at a meeting Wednesday.</p>
<p>Both DeRose and North Allegheny athletic director Bob Bozzuto declined comment, preferring to wait until after the school board vote.</p>
<p>At North Allegheny, DeRose would take over for Keith Noftz, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/03/10/keith-noftz-north-allegheny-basketball-resigns/stories/202003100101" target="_blank">who resigned in March</a> after four seasons. North Allegheny made the WPIAL playoffs in three of Noftz’s four seasons, but the Tigers never finished higher than third in section play, were 0-3 in the postseason and 46-44 under Noftz.</p>
<p>DeRose averaged 20 wins in his five years at Penn Hills, going 100-26. His teams made it to the WPIAL semifinals three times and won the WPIAL Class 6A title in 2018. Before coming to Penn Hills, DeRose coached South Park for one season and had a 16-7 record.</p>
<p>Before DeRose went to South Park, he coached two years in the North Allegheny program as a middle school coach.&nbsp;He also spent a decade as a head coach on the college level. DeRose was at Community College of Beaver County for six years, Penn State McKeesport for three and Chowan (N.C.) for two.</p>
<p>DeRose lives in the North Allegheny School District, only a few miles from the high school.</p>
