<h1>Pa. officials urging voters to apply for mail-in ballots ahead of April primary </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Warning that COVID-19 could rattle primary election season, officials in Pennsylvania are urging voters to apply for mail-in ballots and candidates to change the way they campaign ahead of the April 28 contests.</p>
<p>Wanda Murren, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of State, said the department is having “comprehensive discussions about a range of potential options” for the primary election, as officials across the commonwealth look to calm voters who are unsure how to proceed if the novel coronavirus impacts in-person voting.</p>
<p>“Those discussions are being held in consultation with the Department of Health, the governor’s office, the legislature and the counties,” Ms. Murren said. “Our focus is on best ways to protect the integrity of the election while safeguarding public health.”</p>
<p>The state will notify the public immediately if there is a change to voting procedure, but in the meantime, Pennsylvania’s new mail-in ballot option provides a “valuable alternative” and “can be used for any reason or no reason at all,” Ms. Murren said.</p>
<p>This, coincidentally, is the first election cycle in which Pennsylvania voters are permitted to vote by mail-in ballot, after Gov. Tom Wolf signed the Act 77 voter reform legislation into law in October.</p>
<p>As of March 12, more than 22,000 registered voters had requested a mail-in ballot for the primary, in addition to the more than 40,000 who have signed up for a traditional absentee ballot.</p>
<p>But officials are anticipating those numbers to rise as stakeholders advertise the new option as an alternative to physically going to the polls.</p>
<p>Voters have until April 21 at 5 p.m. to apply for a mail-in or absentee ballot, and while absentee ballots require voters to disclose if they are —&nbsp;among other things —&nbsp;away at college or going out of town for work, mail-in ballots don’t.</p>
<p>The mail-in ballot application can be completed online at VotesPA.com/ApplyMailBallot with a valid Pennsylvania driver’s license or PennDOT-issued photo ID. Voters can also download and complete a paper application and send it to their county election office, or fill one out in person.</p>
<p>When the primary ballot is finalized, the ballots will be sent to approved applicants.</p>
<p>It’s the best way to “ensure one’s vote is counted if concerned about heading to the polls,” said Charlie O’Neill, deputy executive director of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania,</p>
<p>But Democrat Rep. Kevin Boyle, ranking member of the Pennsylvania House State Government Committee, wants the state to go one step further.</p>
<p>Mr. Boyle is introducing a bill that would require the state to mail all voters a ballot application with prepaid postage, noting that no one knows for sure if in-person voting will be “safe or viable” and that seniors —&nbsp;especially at risk for the virus —&nbsp;“make up a large portion of both our poll workers and voters.”</p>
<p>“We don’t know what the future beholds or whether in person voting will be safe let alone viable for citizens &amp; election workers alike,” Mr. Boyle wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>Mike Straub, spokesman for the House Republican Caucus and the House Majority Leader, said “nothing specific is being pursued just yet” as far as election changes, but discussions are underway.</p>
<p>“As the challenges continue to evolve, we will take a look at what updates may be necessary to our primary election process, but pursuing any particular election proposal at this point would be premature,” Mr. Straub said.</p>
<p>Ms. Murren said the Department of State is collaborating with the Department of Health to give guidance to county officials ahead of the primary, including information about providing supplies for poll workers and voters to wash their hands and how to sanitize voting machines and clean tables, voting areas and equipment.</p>
<p>Brendan Welch, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said the party is encouraging voters to take advantage of mail-in voting, and offered advice for candidates running across the state who are wondering how they should proceed with canvassing, door-knocking and organizing.</p>
<p>“We have moved to digital and virtual organizing and are encouraging other campaigns and candidates to do the same for the time being,” Mr. Welch said.</p>
