<h1>Community College of Beaver County's Yazid Powell pays tribute to Kobe Bryant with 81-point performance</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Fans across the world have paid tribute to Kobe Bryant, the late former NBA star, since his death in a helicopter crash Sunday. Community College of Beaver County guard Yazid Powell put just a bit of extra effort into his.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The freshman from Philadelphia, Bryant’s home town, went off for 81 points in a 147-61 beating of Butler County Community College at the school’s Center Township campus Monday. Bryant, you’ll likely remember, scored that total in a legendary performance in 2006.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Powell had a chance to exceed 81 points with a free throw toward the end of the game, but as you can see around the 2:20 mark of the video, he intentionally missed to preserve the famous total in tribute to Bryant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, he posted a photo of himself holding a sign that reads “81” while wearing Bryant’s famed No. 24.</p>
<p>That’s teammate Chris Greene’s number, according to the CCBC roster. Powell normally wears No. 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another post, Powell explained his love for the former Los Angeles Laker, who retired in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
