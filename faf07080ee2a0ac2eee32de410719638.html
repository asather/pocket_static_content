<h1>Penn-Trafford vs. Gateway game canceled, New Castle shut down due to COVID-19 concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The number of WPIAL football games postponed and the list of teams shut down because of COVID-19 cases continues to grow.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, the Penn-Trafford School District announced that it has closed school and shut down all sports and extracurricular activities through Tuesday because a staff member and a student in the district tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>That means the big football game scheduled for Sunday night between Penn-Trafford and Gateway has been called off and will not be rescheduled. The game was originally scheduled at Gateway for Friday night but was pushed back to Sunday because of coronavirus cases at Gateway two weeks ago. The game was going to pit Penn-Trafford, the Post-Gazette’s No. 4-ranked WPIAL Class 5A team, against No. 2 Gateway.</p>
<p>The Penn-Trafford cancellation means Gateway will play only four games in the regular season. The Gators had two games canceled earlier against Pine-Richland and Latrobe.</p>
<p>The Penn-Trafford vs. Gateway game would’ve likely decided the Big East conference championship. The WPIAL is expected to announce next week what it will do about games that aren’t made up and will affect playoff qualifiers.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, New Castle decided Friday to shut down its football team for two weeks because a player tested positive for COVID-19. The player was tested Tuesday night.</p>
<p>New Castle’s games against Beaver Friday night and Blackhawk on Oct. 16 have been postponed. New Castle, which has a 0-4 record, would then have only one game left against Chartiers Valley (Oct. 23).</p>
<p>New Castle athletic director Sam Flora said the football team most likely won’t practice until Oct. 20.</p>
<p>“We’re hoping to play that last game at Chartiers Valley,” Flora said. “But we have to sit down as a district next week and get everything cleared up and come up with a game plan.”</p>
