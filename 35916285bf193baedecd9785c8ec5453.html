<h1>Black man killed by Calif. deputies is brother of man found hanging last week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The brother of Robert Fuller, a black man found hanging from a tree near a Southern California city hall, was killed by Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies in a shootout on Wednesday, officials say.</p>
<p>Detectives followed Terron Jammal Boone, who they said matched the description of someone who had committed a kidnapping and domestic assault, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.</p>
<p>When Boone’s vehicle stopped, the man opened the front passenger door and fired shots at officers with a handgun, according to the department.</p>
<p>An officer on the scene responded by shooting Boone several times in the upper torso, killing him, officials say.</p>
<p>Authorities said a female driver and a 7-year-old girl were also in the vehicle. The unidentified driver was struck by gunfire and later released from the hospital, and the girl was unharmed, according to the department.</p>
<p>Boone had been charged with assault with a deadly weapon, false imprisonment, domestic violence and criminal threats in Los Angeles County Superior Court the day before his death, The Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>The relationships between Boone, the woman and the girl weren’t clarified by the sheriff’s department, but the woman wasn’t the accuser in the spousal assault matter, according to the news service.</p>
<p>A handgun was found at the scene, and no deputies were harmed in the exchange of gunfire.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said in an early morning statement that it was waiting on coroner and family identification, but an attorney for the family told CNN that the family knows it was Boone who died.</p>
<p>“This afternoon I had to notify the sisters of Robert Fuller that their half brother Terron Jammal Boone was killed by Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies in Kern County,” Jamon Hicks told the outlet in a statement.</p>
<p>Hicks didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post, but he told CNN that the family and his legal team wouldn’t provide additional comment on the incident until they receive all the information about it.</p>
<p>“The family respectfully asks that their privacy be respected,” Hicks told CNN.</p>
<p>The news of Boone’s death comes a little more than a week after his half-brother’s body was found hanging from a tree in Palmdale, Calif.</p>
<p>Authorities initially ruled Fuller’s death a suicide, but that conclusion was rejected by his family members, who say he wasn’t suicidal. Diamond Alexander, his sister, said during a Saturday rally in front of Palmdale City Hall that she wanted answers.</p>
<p>“We want to find out the truth of what really happened. Everything that they’ve been telling us has not been right,” she told the crowd, according to the Los Angeles Times. “My brother was not suicidal. My brother was a survivor.”</p>
<p>State and federal officials will oversee an investigation into Fuller’s death, as well as the hanging death of 38-year-old Malcolm Harsch, a homeless black man who was found hanging from a tree in Victorville, Calif., late last month, according to the AP.</p>
<p>Sheriffs in both areas said they are committed to investigating the deaths despite finding no evidence of foul play, the AP reported.</p>
