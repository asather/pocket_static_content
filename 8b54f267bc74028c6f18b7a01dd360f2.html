<h1>Colleges adjust to Title IX revisions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the midst of trying to formulate a plan that would allow students to safely return to campus amid a global pandemic, colleges and universities across the country have also had the task of realigning their Title IX practices involving sexual violence against students to match new regulations.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of Education, Besty DeVos announced the new plans in May and required that they be implemented by Aug. 14. These new regulations have received mixed opinions from schools and advocacy groups.</p>
<p>Ms. DeVos said in a news release put out by the Department of Education that the regulation change was necessary because it “restores balance to the scales of justice in our schools.”</p>
<p>Many are saying that the main difference between Ms. DeVos’ new rules and the rules enacted under the the Obama administration is that now they are backed by the force of law. They also set new standards on participation by those accused.</p>
<p>Just over a week into the new policies, some local Title IX coordinators feel that these new regulations weren’t exactly necessary for the protection of their students.</p>
<p>“I have issues with the final rule. I think it again puts up barriers for victims,” said Sumana Misra-Zets, the civil rights compliance officer and Title IX coordinator at Community College of Allegheny County.</p>
<p>Under the new regulations, institutions have a new definition of what falls under sexual violence, have narrower instructions of what types of cases they have to investigate and are now required to hold live hearings for investigations.</p>
<p>Though there are more policy changes, these three have sparked both praise and criticism.</p>
<p>The new regulations have changed the definition of sexual harassment to be “unwelcome conduct so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to education.”</p>
<p>Under the Obama administration guidelines, sexual violence was described as "physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person’s will or where a person is incapable of giving consent," and included rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, and sexual coercion.</p>
<p>Administrators at Carlow University see these new definitions as a more concrete guideline for institutions.</p>
<p>“They’ve more clearly defined what is equity for all parties involved,” said Tim Phillips, the vice president of student affairs and dean of students at Carlow. “I think it's much more structured what we can and can’t do and what we should and shouldn’t do.”</p>
<p>Things like sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking also fall under the category of unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex, under the new guidelines.</p>
<p>“We’re concerned that the new rules will likely be harmful to victims of sexual misconduct,” said Donna Greco, the policy director at the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape. “It not only harms victims and survivors, it makes the larger campus less safe, because with a lack of reporting, administrators won’t know the true prevalence of sexual violence on their campuses.”</p>
<p>The new regulations only require institutions to investigate incidents that occur on campus or school-related property, such as Greek life housing, or a field trip.</p>
<p>The institutions are still encouraged to investigate those incidents that occur away from school-sanctioned property or events, but it is no longer required.</p>
<p>One of the biggest criticisms of the previous policy was that it pressured schools to side with the accuser before an investigation was completed. Now, some believe the new processes are a more equitable way to handle conduct violations.</p>
<p>Jackie Smith, the director of disability services and Title IX coordinator at Carlow, believes that the new regulations look at equity rather than fairness.</p>
<p>“We think about fairness being everybody gets the same thing,” she said. “We know that fairness isn’t really fair, but if we think about equity and people getting what they need, then this means that both parties are supported through the process.”</p>
<p>With the implementation of the live hearing process, supporters of the changes say that due process is being restored.</p>
<p>“The regulations really just codify what appellate courts across the country have been saying for years now,” said Jennifer Braceras, director of the Independent Women’s Law Center. “Which is that colleges and universities have to provide basic fair process when they adjudicate … in the disciplinary context and in Title IX.”</p>
<p>However, advocacy groups for sexual violence survivors worry that the requirement of a live hearing will dissuade victims from coming forward.</p>
<p>“We feel like they’re creating these quasi court rooms, which is really not the intention of Title IX as a civil matter,” said Ms. Greco. “It can be retraumatizing to have to face the person that assaulted them and be cross examined.”</p>
<p>The new guidelines do protect those that come forward from having to see the accused face-to-face during the live hearing, but the victimes could be cross examined, which according to Ms. Greco, could be retraumatizing.</p>
<p>The live hearings allow both the victim and accused to have advisers of their own choosing, which could be attorneys.</p>
<p>CCAC had already been conducting investigations with live hearings, but not to the formal extent that they now must.</p>
<p>“I think the formal hearing process is much more like a court process, which will deter people. I don't think that’s appropriate in an institution of higher education,” Ms. Misa-Zets said. “The whole reason why under the Obama administration they changed it to be much more victim centered is to increase the opportunity and avenues for people to report, and now they’ve again limited that.”</p>
<p>But some feel that the new guidelines help to encourage victims to come forward.</p>
<p>“It's very clear the regulations encourage reporting but the regulations encourage support for students who don’t want to move forward with an investigation,” said Ms. Braceras. “The new regulations are very supportive of victims. They simply require that the accused students be allowed to have an adviser … and essentially be allowed to tell their side of the story.”</p>
<p>Kenneth L. Marcus, assistant secretary of the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Office for Civil Rights said that these new regulations are a “game-changer.”</p>
<p>“It establishes that schools and colleges must take sexual harassment seriously, while also ensuring a fair process for everyone involved. It marks the end of the false dichotomy of either protecting survivors, while ignoring due process, or protecting the accused, while disregarding sexual misconduct,” he said in a statement released by the Department of Education.</p>
