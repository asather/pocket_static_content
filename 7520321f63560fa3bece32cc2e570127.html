<h1>Obituary: E. Maxine Bruhns, ran Pitt's Nationality Rooms for 54 years</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>E. Maxine Bruhns, the diminutive nonagenarian powerhouse behind who loomed large over the University of Pittsburgh campus as director of the school’s famous Nationality Rooms for more than five decades until her retirement in January, died Friday.</p>
<p>Ms. Bruhns was 96. She died at UPMC Shadyside.</p>
<p>Standing 5-foot-4 and weighing only 100 pounds, Ms. Bruhns couldn’t command a room physically, but she nevertheless left no question about who was in charge at the Cathedral of Learning in Oakland, home to the Nationality Rooms.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/pitt-nationality-rooms-bruhns/?cid=search" target="_blank">profile earlier this year in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a> of the&nbsp;West Virginia native, who also ran Pitt’s Intercultural Exchange Programs, said that she was “not shy about letting everyone know what needed to get done and not above a little colorful language for effect.”</p>
<p>It was Ms. Bruhns’ research that breathed life into the histories of the immigrants who arrived in Pittsburgh and Allegheny County from all over the world, and hers was the voice that narrated their stories. She was responsible for the narrations for nearly all of the 31 classrooms.</p>
<p>“Maxine spent more than 50 years overseeing our Nationality Rooms,” Pitt Chancellor Patrick Gallagher said in a statement. “She was a generous donor, beloved academic leader and respected global ambassador for the University of Pittsburgh. She was also deeply protective of the integrity, history and magic wrapped into each room and—along the way—became as famous and iconic as the program itself. Without question: We are deeply grateful for her many contributions to Pitt and look forward to celebrating her legacy for years to come.”</p>
<p>Born in Grafton, W. Va. in 1924, Ms. Bruhns met her late husband, Fred Bruhns, at the Ohio State University. He had immigrated to the U.S. from Germany in 1941, according to Pitt, which said he was imprisoned in Berlin for two years for anti-Nazi activity.</p>
<p>The couple married in 1946 and came to Pittsburgh in 1965. Mr. Bruhns, who died more than a decade ago at 90, earned his doctorate in Pittsburgh and taught at Pitt’s&nbsp;Graduate School of Public and International Affairs and worked in refugee resettlement. Ms. Bruhns, meanwhile, worked as executive secretary of Pitt’s cultural and educational exchange committee, the school said.</p>
<p>The couple lived in Squirrel Hill and the Fox Chapel area. They had no children.</p>
<p>Ms. Bruhns was a throwback, someone who didn’t use a computer, but at the same time cut a worldly figure who traveled to 83 countries.</p>
<p>She and Mr. Bruhns traveled extensively before settling down in Pittsburgh. In 2006 she described to the Post-Gazette her facility with language: She spoke&nbsp;French “well,” German “with cute little mistakes,” and “conversational” Arabic, Farsi and Greek. Add to that “basic” Italian and Cambodian and “emergency” Spanish and Chinese.</p>
<p>The globe-trotting couple went to&nbsp;Austria shortly after World War II to resettle war refugees. From there they went to Beirut, where Ms. Bruhns finished a master’s degree and her husband examined the Palestinian refugee crisis. Ten years before they came to Pittsburgh the couple helped refugees from the north in South Vietnam. They then ventured to&nbsp;Cambodia and Iran.</p>
<p>“Long before diversity and inclusion became part of institutional conversations, Maxine honored—and celebrated—nationalities from around the world. She wove them into the culture at Pitt,” Ariel C. Armony, vice provost for global affairs and director of the University Center for International Studies, which houses the Nationality Rooms, said in a statement. “She was crucial in transforming the Nationality Rooms into the Pittsburgh-famous destination they are today.”</p>
