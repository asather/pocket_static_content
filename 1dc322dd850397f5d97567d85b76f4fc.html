<p>Authorities on Wednesday located the body of a 10-year-old boy who fell into the Ohio River in Beaver County on Monday.</p>

<p>The identity of the child has not yet been released.</p>
<p>Police and fire authorities said the boy <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/05/18/missing-boy-search-Ohio-River-Beaver-County-Ambridge-Aliquippa-Bridge/stories/202005180111" target="_blank">fell into the river</a>&nbsp;just north of the Ambridge-Aliquippa Bridge. He was with a group of children biking along the river and fell into a drop-off near a sandbar while trying to retrieve a lost shoe.</p>

<p>“Our heartfelt condolences to the family,” fire Chief Robert Gottschalk said.</p>
