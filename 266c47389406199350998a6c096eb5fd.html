<h1>Chad Kuhl's return more than just a sentimental story for Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The feel of the mound beneath his spikes, the Clemente Bridge and the city of Pittsburgh over his shoulder, the cozy feel and look of the limestone wall behind the catcher, Chad Kuhl noticed and enjoyed all of the perks of home while throwing a simulated game at PNC Park on Wednesday night.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Just imagine how the Pirates’ right-handed pitcher, who’s returning from Tommy John surgery, will feel when the game is real, even if there still won’t be fans in the stands.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“There's really no other way to describe it,” Kuhl said Thursday on a Zoom call with local reporters. “It's just good to be back.”</span></p>
<p>By nearly all accounts, Kuhl is all the way back. He may split a rotation spot with Steven Brault, occupy one himself or contribute as a long man out of the bullpen. But no matter what happens, this version of Kuhl will likely be different than the last.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">In a good way.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">That version of Kuhl had a four-seam fastball that averaged 95.3 mph, the pitch occasionally touching upper 90s. This version was at about 93-94 mph Wednesday, occasionally a tick higher, but he was worried less about velocity and more about pitch-execution.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Oh, and this version of Kuhl has been perfecting a curveball that has thus far drawn rave reviews, a pitch that Kuhl used 13.1% of the time in 2018 — he threw his four-seamer, sinker and slider more — and against which batters hit just .125 and slugged .188.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Kuhl has thought about what it will be like to toe the rubber at PNC Park again, his first competitive action since he left a game against the Mets on June 26, 2018, after just four innings. The affable 27-year-old couldn’t possibly be more excited about the thought.</span></p>
<p>“I think that will be super special in itself, knowing that it's just been so long since I've been on the mound,” Kuhl said. “It's going to be a really good feeling to be back out there."</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">It will be even more special for the Pirates if Kuhl looks like an advanced version of his 2018 self. That season, Kuhl went 5-5 with a 4.55 ERA in 16 starts, striking out 81 and walking 33 in 85 innings.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Kuhl threw hard back then, but it wasn’t always productive. Against his four-seamer and sinker, opposing hitters slugged .547 and .600, respectively. When Kuhl went with spin, those numbers dropped to .295 for his slider and .188 for the curve, which Kuhl used more than twice as much as he did in 2017 (6.2).</span></p>
<p>There was significant confidence gained in the curve, said Kuhl, who spent a significant amount of time this offseason trying to improve its spin rate (an already-elite 2,901 rpm) and his overall feel for the pitch.</p>
<p>Kuhl said it now rivals how he feels about his slider, which has long been his bread and butter.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I feel really good with where it's at and what I'm doing with it,” Kuhl said.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The delayed start to the 2020 season did not hurt Kuhl. In fact, it probably helped. After just two one-inning outings in Bradenton, Fla., Kuhl was likely slated to start the season in the bullpen.</span></p>
<p>Then the coronavirus took over, and Kuhl got an extension. He threw at his alma mater, Middletown High in Delaware, and worked out in his basement gym, where he has an exercise bike, free weights, a pull-up bar and rowing machine.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">It wasn’t pretty, but it looks like it was enough.</span></p>
<p>“Humble beginnings,” Kuhl joked. “Going to the old high school field that I thought was just so awesome and you realize it's just a dirt field ... it was really cool just to be back there. I was able to get my work in on a consistent basis, which was the important thing.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The good news is that Kuhl was able to spend a little more time fishing, and he said he relished the chance to actually spend Mother’s Day with his mom, Wendy.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Since getting back around the Pirates, there’s been talk about piggybacking starts with Brault, which Kuhl said he’s perfectly OK doing. He’d also love to continue starting.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Whatever wins ballgames,” Kuhl said.</span></p>
<p>Solid pitching can sure win ballgames, and the Pirates will need more of that.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Without Jameson Taillon and Chris Archer this season, a fine way to tip the scales the other direction might well be the re-emergence of Kuhl, the ninth-round pick in 2013 armed with an even better curveball and some additional perspective.</span></p>
<p>“I think I had that moment in Florida where it just really hit me that I was back and was throwing pain free,” Kuhl said. “I called my dad afterward and was so happy, relieved, whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“That was super special. Felt really good to be back out there. I'm sure this one will feel good, just in a different way.”</span></p>
