<h1>Whatever happened to Blab?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Video chats and livestreams have been around for much of the 2010s, with some platforms surviving startup pains and others that were gone in a flash.</p>
<p>There was Meerkat, which evolved into Houseparty. And does anyone remember Blab?</p>
<p>In 2015, the easy-to-use app was swept up in a wave of new livestreaming apps. But Blab was gone by 2016.</p>
<p>“Blab is the latest to take the digital marketing world by storm,” the website smartershift.com declared in 2015, noting that hosts can invite an unlimited amount of people to join the discussion and four video images can be viewed at one time.&nbsp;Many fans at the time declared it an ideal way to build online communities.</p>
<p>The service had <a href="https://marketingland.com/blab-shuts-live-video-platform-188089" target="_blank">3.9 million users and an average site time of 65 minutes per day in its first year</a>, but when it was suddenly shut down, co-founder Shaan Puri said only about 10 percent of Blab’s userbase visited regularly.</p>
<p>“The struggle with livestreaming” is attention spans, Puri said at the time. “We need to show you something awesome, that’s being made right now. Turns out, that’s really tough. It killed Meerkat, and Periscope and [Facebook] Live are feeling the pain right now. Really, only Twitch has gotten it right with livestreaming video games.”</p>
<p>Blab — not to be confused with BlaB! chat systems — also had problems with video quality when it shut down. But that was then. Today, any platform that allows four or more people at a time to video chat is going to get a good look.&nbsp;</p>
