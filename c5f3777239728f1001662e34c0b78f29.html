<h1>Front Porch Theatricals will skip 2020; move musicals to 2021</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On what should have been the opening day of Front Porch Theatricals’ 10th season, the musical company announced that the two shows scheduled for this year will move to next summer.</p>
<p>“A Man of No Importance” is now scheduled to run May 21-30, 2021, and “Grand Hotel,” Aug. 20-29, 2021. The casts and creative teams hired for both shows have been contracted to return in 2021.</p>
<p>In a statement, Front Porch co-producers Bruce E.G. Smith and Nancy Zionts said, “With the state’s continuing public health restrictions and guidelines prohibiting large gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have re-evaluated our plans for the current season. While we long to be in the theater with all of you, after much consideration, we have made the decision to postpone our 2020 season to next year.”</p>
<p>Ticket holders will be contacted with options.</p>
