<h1>National briefs: Rosie Perez testifies in Weinstein trial </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Do the Right Thing” actress Rosie Perez testified Friday that fellow screen star Annabella Sciorra told her in the mid-1990s that Harvey Weinstein had raped her but that she couldn’t go to the police because “he’d destroy me.”</p>
<p>Taking the stand at the former Hollywood mogul’s rape trial, Ms. Perez said her friend Ms. Sciorra had told her at some point in 1993, her voice shaking on the phone, that something had happened to her: “I think it was rape.”</p>
<p>Ms. Perez said she asked if Ms. Sciorra knew who had attacked her, but Ms. Sciorra wouldn’t say at the time. But months later, on another phone call from London, she said Mr. Weinstein was harassing her and she was scared, Ms. Perez said.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘He’s the one that raped you,’” and they both began crying, Ms. Perez testified.</p>
<p>“Please go to the police,” Ms. Perez said she told her friend. She said Ms. Sciorra responded: “I can’t — he’d destroy me.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, Ms. Sciorra told jurors that the movie producer pushed his way into her New York apartment, pinned her on a bed and forced himself on her in 1993 or 1994. She said Ms. Perez was one of a few people she told about the encounter before coming forward publicly in 2017.</p>
<p>Mr. Weinstein denies ever having nonconsensual sex. His lawyers said Ms. Perez shouldn’t be allowed to testify, but Judge James Burke decided to allow it.</p>
<p><strong>Saints shield emails</strong></p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints are going to court to keep the public from seeing hundreds of emails that allegedly show team executives doing public relations damage control for the area’s Roman Catholic archdiocese to help it contain the fallout from a burgeoning sexual abuse crisis.</p>
<p>Attorneys for about two dozen men suing the church say in court filings that the 276 documents they obtained through discovery show that the NFL team, whose owner, Gayle Benson, is devoutly Catholic, aided the Archdiocese of New Orleans in its “pattern and practice of concealing its crimes.”</p>
<p>“Obviously, the Saints should not be in the business of assisting the Archdiocese, and the Saints’ public relations team is not in the business of managing the public relations of criminals engaged in pedophilia,” the attorneys wrote in a court filing. “The Saints realize that if the documents at issue are made public, this professional sports organization also will be smearing itself.”</p>
<p>The Saints organization and its attorneys emphatically disputed any suggestion that the team helped the church cover up crimes. In a statement Friday, the Saints said the archdiocese sought its advice on how to handle media attention that would come from its 2018 release of its list of more than 50 clergy members “credibly accused” of sexual abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Opioid suits can begin</strong></p>
<p>State and local governments have been leading the legal fight against the opioid industry, seeking payouts to help them deal with the fallout from the nation’s addiction crisis. Average Americans are about to get their shot.</p>
<p>On Friday, the federal judge overseeing the bankruptcy case of Purdue Pharma set a June 30 deadline to file a claim against the company. That includes governments, entities such as hospitals and, for the first time, individuals who have personal injury claims.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how much money might be at stake. Purdue reached an agreement with some states and local governments that could be worth more than $10 billion over time as part of its bankruptcy filing. Once a settlement and restructuring deal for Purdue is approved, the next step will be deciding how to divide the company’s assets.</p>
