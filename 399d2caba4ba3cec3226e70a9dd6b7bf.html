<h1>Amid rise of stimulant use, Pennsylvania asks Congress for flexibility in opioid funding</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON —&nbsp;Pennsylvania’s top drug and alcohol coordinator told Congress that $230 million in federal funding to fight the opioid crisis had helped the state create addiction programs reaching thousands of people and contributed to an 18% drop in the state’s overdose deaths in 2018.</p>
<p>But, the coordinator added, a rise in stimulant use challenged the state in 2019 — and the state was bound, in many cases, by drug-specific federal grants that couldn’t be shifted to address issues related to drugs like meth and cocaine.</p>
<p>Jennifer Smith, secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs, told lawmakers they should direct more money to block grants, usually a more sustainable funding mechanism.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>“Federal funding opportunities should recognize that this crisis has shifted over time — and will continue to shift — affording states with greater flexibility to address substances in addition to opioids,” Ms. Smith testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p>
<p>Ms. Smith joined state officials from West Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts and Rhode Island in sharing how their governments have used federal funds earmarked to fight the opioid epidemic. Last September, the committee sent requests for information to 16 states, including Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Ms. Smith’s testimony reported positive developments that she attributed to federal funding mixed with state and local resources.</p>
<p>The state has&nbsp;distributed nearly 13,000 free naloxone kits and expanded medication-assisted treatment in state prisons and some county jails. It has coordinated transfers of more than 5,000 opioid overdose survivors from emergency rooms to treatment centers. A new 24/7 Get Help Now hotline has fielded more than 52,000 calls.</p>
<p>While she feels the state has made a dent in opioid use, Ms. Smith also is monitoring a rise in stimulant use.&nbsp;Federal grants that specify only opioid programs make it challenging to start programs, she said.</p>
<p>“Some folks who benefit from the program may not identify opioids as their primary substance — or even identify them at all,” she said.</p>
<p>The state wants to build greater treatment accessibility for people with stimulant use disorders, which can manifest in different ways compared to opioid disorders, Ms. Smith said in an interview after the hearing. People using meth tend to exhibit mental health disorders, she explained.</p>
<p>“What we need to do is make sure we equip mental health facilities with the ability to treat substance use disorder if folks are landing there, or we need to build appropriate connections,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Smith credited the state’s expansion of Medicaid, which allowed the state to treat&nbsp;about 125,000 additional patients for addiction problems and freed up federal dollars to build programs.</p>
<p>“Now I think we can spend some time and energy really thinking about looking upstream and to how we improve our prevention efforts,” Ms. Smith said.</p>
