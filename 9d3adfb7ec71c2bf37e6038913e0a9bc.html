<h1>City planning to show drive-in movies beginning Saturday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As drive-in movie theaters are making a comeback in the new era of physical distancing, Pittsburgh’s special events office has decided to join the trend.</p>
<p>The city and Dollar Bank have partnered to create a family-friendly, drive-in movie night series, with six different viewings.</p>
<p>The series will begin Saturday and continue every other Saturday until Aug. 22.</p>
<p>Gates will open at 8 p.m. and the movie will begin at 9.</p>
<p>While admission is free, tickets must be reserved in advance, as there is a limited number of parking spaces available. In fact, Saturday’s showing of “The Lorax” has already run out of spots.</p>
<p>The next movie, “A League of Their Own,” will be shown June 27 in the main parking lot at the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium in Highland Park.</p>
<p>Other movies being shown are&nbsp;“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,”&nbsp;“Men In Black: International,”&nbsp;“The Mighty Ducks,” and the latest release of “Charlie's Angels.”</p>
