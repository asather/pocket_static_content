<h1>Cal U latest to opt for virtual instruction in fall</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The California University of Pennsylvania on Friday became the seventh of the 14 State System of Higher Education schools to move to a remote format for the upcoming fall semester.</p>
<p>In a video message released to students, faculty and staff, university President Geraldine Jones cited the rise in COVID-19 cases in the state and across the country as the reason for the change in plans. Initially, the university planned to reopen for in-person classes on August 17.</p>
<p>“In recent days, it has become apparent that even the best on-campus experience&nbsp;presents too great a risk to our Cal U family,” Ms. Jones said in the message. “Like many of you, I am eager to return to the Cal U we all know and love. But right now, the risks are simply unacceptable.”</p>
<p>On July 10, West Chester University was the first state-owned university to announce that it had moved fall instruction to a remote format. East Stroudsburg, Edinboro, Millersville, Lock Haven and Clarion have since made the decision to operate virtually as well.</p>
<p>Concerns about limited testing and the ability to enforce social distancing were addressed by many universities that made the decision to hold classes remotely for the fall along with the rise in COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Cal U will begin classes on Aug. 24, the initial start date planned for the fall semester. In a news release, the university stated that most classes will function with real-time learning with the ability for students to interact with instructors and classmates virtually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Residence halls will be closed for the semester and student activities will be held virtually, according to the university’s news release.</p>
<p>Students at the University of Pittsburgh’s Oakland campus are likely&nbsp;to begin classes remotely before moving to a hybrid model of in-person and online classes, according to university officials. Depending on the risk of COVID-19 for in person instruction, the university said it will make a decision to offer in-person classes upon moving to a “guarded status,” the least stringent of several categories laid out by the university defined by the level of risk on campus.</p>
<p>Pitt will utilize 179 beds across its campus to quarantine students if they become infected with the virus. The university has purchased spaces in Oakland hotels for additional housing to avoid crowding in the residential halls on campus.</p>
<p>Penn State University announced Friday a staggered move-in schedule for the fall semester, beginning with first year students on Aug. 17. The university is set to begin classes Aug. 24 with a hybrid model of in-person and virtual classes.</p>
