<h1>Robert Levin still wants furniture chain back, but Art Van has go-ahead to liquidate</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Despite a federal judge’s approval of Art Van Furniture LLC’s plans to liquidate 44 Levin and Wolf furniture stores in addition to nearly 150 Art Van stores dotting the Midwest, previous owner Robert Levin is still interested in reacquiring the furniture and home furnishing chain that bears his family name. <strong><br></strong></p>
<p>But he acknowledged Wednesday that the process has now become more complicated and a resolution even more uncertain.</p>
<p>“It’s major mess, basically,” said Mr. Levin in a phone interview.</p>
<p>Art Van officials on Tuesday said they had converted the Michigan-based company’s&nbsp;original Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring filing to a Chapter 7 liquidation for the 189 furniture stores “due to the unforeseeable and significant negative impact of the current public health crisis.”</p>
<p>The company, they said, does not enough cash to cover its obligations under a Chapter 11 liquidation.</p>
<p>That is not good news for Levin customers who have put down deposits or paid for furniture that has not been delivered.</p>
<p>The company, according to a <a href="https://www.levinfurniture.com/" target="_blank">posting on the Levin Furniture</a> website, “is unable to fill any customer orders at this time” and a final decision on those matters will be decided by the Chapter 7 trustee appointed by the court.&nbsp;Nor will extended warranties be honored, the company said.</p>
<p>The filing, which could open up the assets to multiple bidders, is particularly frustrating and upsetting for Mr. Levin, who just five weeks ago announced he had executed a letter of intent to buy back the iconic Pittsburgh stores plus the Johnstown-based Wolf Furniture stores located in Pennsylvania, all of which Art Van had slated for liquidation.</p>
<p>Mr. Levin&nbsp;sold the furniture and home furnishings chain to Art Van in 2017.</p>
<p>The timing of his bid to buy back the business could hardly have been worse, though, as growing concern about the COVID-19 pandemic forced an ongoing closure of the stores, shutting off all revenue.</p>
<p>On March 20, Art Van officials cited the lost business for its decision to close all of the stores permanently rather than follow through the non-binding agreement they had reached with Mr. Levin.</p>
<p>Afterward, both sides pointed the finger at the other for backing out of the earlier agreement, Mr. Levin saying Art Van wanted to change terms of the original agreement and Art Van countering that Mr. Levin’s associates had decided against going forward.</p>
<p>Had the original agreement been finalized, Mr. Levin said he would have taken over responsibility for seeing that customers’ orders were filled or deposits were reimbursed and that Levin’s 1,200 employees continued on the company payroll.</p>
<p>Instead, Art Van parent AVF Holding Co. paid Levin employee salaries until most of them lost their jobs and health benefits last month.</p>
<p>“I’m very concerned about the customer issue and I’m very concerned about the employees who were terminated,” Mr. Levin said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Although he has no legal obligation to do so, he said disbursements from a $2 million fund he has set up to help employees cover health care and other costs will begin next week.</p>
<p>“And if I were to get back in business, I would want to reacquire our family name.”</p>
<p>Mr. Levin said he “understands conceptually” Art Van’s decision to liquidate, given the uncertainty of operating a business when it’s not clear — given the current pandemic — when they can reopen or how quickly customers might return given the new social distancing norms.</p>
<p>Still, he said he had made another offer on March 28 to buy the Levin and Wolf stores.&nbsp;“It’s just very disappointing that it’s played out the way it has.”</p>
