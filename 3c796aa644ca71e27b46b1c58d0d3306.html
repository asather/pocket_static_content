<h1>N.J. woman gets probation in fake marriage scam with Nigerian man in Whitehall</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pittsburgh judge on Thursday gave a New Jersey woman probation for her role in a sham marriage to her fake husband, a Nigerian man who had been living in Whitehall.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Marilyn Horan imposed a three-year term on Ajia Strauss, 28, of Newark.</p>
<p>She had pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S.</p>
<p>Her sham husband, Monsuru Ogunbiyi, had also admitted his guilt and received time served.</p>
<p>Starting in 2016, the pair pretended to be married so that Ogunbiyi, a Nigerian citizen, could become a permanent U.S. resident.</p>
<p>He paid her $1,500 on the day of their marriage in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The two then filled out various documents to give to federal authorities about the purported marriage, including one that said they'd been living together in New Jersey when they were not. Ogunbiyi was living in Whitehall and Strauss in Newark at the time.</p>
<p>Prior to sentencing, Strauss' public defender, Sarah Levin, said her client suffers from bipolar disorder and drug addiction and was under the influence of drugs when she agreed to the fake marriage for money.</p>
<p>"When she was confronted by law enforcement, Ajia owned up to her wrongdoing and quickly accepted responsibility for the choices she made leading to this arrest," Ms. Levin said in asking for probation.</p>
<p>Strauss entered drug treatment in January and has been sober since, she said, and working for UPS.</p>
<p>The case is one of several prosecuted in federal court here this year and last involving foreign citizens trying to fool immigration authorities with bogus marriages so one of the parties can stay in the U.S.</p>
<p>The most recent is one against two brothers from India, Rajinder and Makhan Singh. Makhan, of Pittsburgh, pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy in admitting that he arranged for his brother to marry a U.S. woman for the purpose of evading immigration laws. The case against Rajinder is pending.</p>
<p>Last year, Norman McCullough of McKees Rocks received probation after admitting that he pretended to be married to a Nigerian woman so she could gain benefits as a permanent U.S. resident. He admitted that he conspired with a Nigerian couple in Whitehall, Adediran Bamgbose and Temitope Elemosho, to enter into a fake marriage with Elemosho in exchange for money.</p>
<p>Elemosho and Bamgbose each received probation.</p>
