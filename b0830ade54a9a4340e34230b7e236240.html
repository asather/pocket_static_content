<h1>Pandemic pickup band becomes full-fledged unit in newly formed Charov Nitzah</h1>

<p>In April, Peter Guellard, bassist of the long-running Pittsburgh industrial rock band Venus in Furs, assembled a group of local musicians to jam out an online cover of the folk classic “Man of Constant Sorrow.”</p>
<p>Now, four members of that supergroup have taken the next step in becoming a full-fledged band.</p>
<p>Charov Nitzah, based on the Polish word for “witch” (czarownica), debuts with a cover and music video of the Dead Can Dance song "The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove” that is indeed bewitching, and exotic.</p>
<p>Guellard is joined in Charov Nitzah by guitarist Dirk Miller (Rusted Root), drummer Tracey Whorton and singer/dancer/actress Charmaine Evonne, a Mars native who is back in this area after living in Austin and New Orleans.</p>

<p>“This song is actually just a jump start and most of our original material that we already recorded is much heavier and ‘rockier,’” Guellard says. “What we have in mind, musically, is a cultural melting pot [with] some Middle Eastern instruments as well, but all built on a foundation of guitar-driven industrial sound.”</p>
<p>They started out by recording demos remotely, but are now working on a full-length album at The Church Recording Studio im Brookline.</p>
<p>Guellard says Charov Nitzah is “super politically involved.”</p>
<p>“The video we are working on right now, ‘Welcome To The First Day of NWO,’ was partially shot at a BLM protest and we are hoping to release it before the end of September. We are hoping to put out an online live performance pretty soon involving computer generated graphics, fire and lots of guest musicians playing ethnic instruments.”</p>
