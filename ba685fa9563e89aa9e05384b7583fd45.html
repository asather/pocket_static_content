<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 02.27.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Zeise</strong>: OK let’s get started</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Do the Steelers find a "Charlie Batch" type back up QB and ride with Mason if Ben isn't ready or do they find another Duck for the third spot? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Kevin Colbert has already said they won’t and they will ride with Mason Rudolph. They also don’t have the money to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Paul, last week chat we were talking who could be the threat for penguins chances this season to win it all, we were all excited including you really.. this penguins are really awful with 4 straight since we chat last week, they look lost for some reason.. anybody can beat them really.. any hopes? Thanks.. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t like to ride the highs and lows of a season or get caught in short samples. This is a really good hockey team that is just playing poorly right now. That’s going to happen in 82 games. Overall I like their chances, they have all the elements needed to win a Stanley Cup. The thing is - so do the Lightning, Bruins, Capitals and Islanders just from the East. This should be a great playoff for fans</p>
<p><strong>Yolanda</strong>: Any idea how the the majority of Steeler players will vote on the labor proposal? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: My guess is it will be similar to the NFL at large. The really highly paid players will vote against it and the middle and lower class players will vote for it. That seems to be the split</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Who do you think will end up being the Pirates starting 3B? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Colin Moran. There is almost no chance it will be Ke’Bryan Hayes <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They don’t think he is ready at the platw</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Although I am a Jeff Capel fan, one who believes that he has the program headed in the right direction, how do you explain the collapse of the team down the stretch for the second year in a row? I am not buying that it is the team's lack of depth? Maybe lack of proper attitude and commitment? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t think it is a good look for anyone and I’m tired of hearing excuses about depth and youth. It looks like they just aren’t playing with any sense of urgency or passion. That’s on him to fix. It isn’t about losing games, though a few of these are winnable. They weren’t even competitive against Syracuse and that’s not acceptable regardless of how much of a “dumpster fire” was inherited</p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: Are the Pens done? They looked great until the last four games. Hopefully just a slump, but this late in the season, you would hope they are getting into playoff shape. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Really? As I just wrote - good teams sometimes go through stretches where they don’t play well. The Pens are a good team, they will be fine</p>
<p><strong>OU812</strong>: What has happened to Pitt basketball these last few games? Last night was ugly. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Like I said, when you don’t play like a team and you lack passion and desperation, you get your ass kicked on your home court by a mediocre team.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Steel</strong>: Is it time to start to second guess Heather Lyke and her 2 major coaching hires? Narduzzi is average at best, and Capel doesnt seem to have control over a young team, they quit on him. Maybe its time to move from the ACC to the MAC? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: She didn’t hire Narduzzi. And Capel is in year 2 of a massive rebuilding project.</p>
<p><strong>Showdog</strong>: Just read a column on the worst contracts in the NFL. The opinion of the writer was the Steelers signing Big Ben to a 68 million contract after a season they missed the playoffs and he threw 16 interceptions hurt the Steelers. The writer stated the only reason Ben was returning this year was to cash in on the contract. What is your opinion of his contract. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It is a terrible contract, I’ve said that for a year. It has and will tie up way too much cap space. And at 38 I don’t think he is a $34 million player. The flip side is the Steelers - and most any team - had no choice as quarterbacks can hold them hostage. There just aren’t enough good ones. I don’t blame the Steelers for signing the deal but it is an awful contract</p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: I know spring break games are often not an indication of a teams hopes for the season, but we expect the Pirates to be terrible. Is their preseason record just confirming that for us before the season starts? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Not at all, the record isn’t meaningful because teams really aren’t playing to win in spring training. It is individual performances that matter and even that can be deceiving.</p>

<p><strong>OU812</strong>: Is Patrick Marleau the missing piece the Pens needed to win the cup? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: An old guy who no longer scores goals? No but he does give them some much needed depth and he adds to their veteran leadership. It was a low risk, low cost move that could help them down the stretch</p>
<p><strong>Mark C.</strong>: Hey Paul, two different media personalities (Jim Bowden of The Athletic and Jesse Pantuosco of Radio.com) mentioned just this morning the possibility of the Pirates signing Yasiel Puig. Have you heard anything regarding this? Just seems odd that two totally separate entities would mention this on the same day. Thanks for your time. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: There have been rumors of this but that was before they signed Jarrod Dustin. Now, unless the front office thinks Gregory Polanco is not capable of staying healthy this year I’m not sure where he fits. And I certainly don’t think he is the kind of guy you want in your clubhouse if he isn’t a starter</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: please don't blow my question off, why don't the steelers move on from ben, he's old, over weight, and in the last 11 years has only 3 playoff wins !!!!!, do you consider that an elite quarterback? don't you think its time to move on? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I wrote it was time to move on last year. Again, this is a terrible contract and at 38 I’m not sure how much he has left. But they are stuck with him and his contract so you have to hope he had enough left to give the team a competent offense.</p>
<p><strong>'Double Divot Dewey</strong>: I don't understand why everyone is so concerned over Big Ben's weight. He has carried a little extra weight in the past, but always is ready at showtime. I expect him to be fully ready and rejuvenated by Game 1 and have our offense rolling again. What say you? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think the concern is that if you are working out and rehabbing that you are gonna be in great shape. And he doesn’t look like he is in great shape so people wonder how hard he has actually worked out</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Does Paxton Lynch have a realistic shot at unseating Rudolph for the number 2 job? <br> <strong>YinzerinVA</strong>: Best month to go see a Pirates game? July last year was too hot. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: May and June - especially since they might still be somewhat relevant!</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Name a pro athlete or two who you had high hopes for, but never panned out. One for me is Tim Worley...potential to be an all timer, but couldn't put it together. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Johnny Football, baby!! I loved that dude at Texas A&amp;M and thought he was gonna be a superstar. Boy was I wrong</p>
<p><strong>Artie Bridge</strong>: I disagree with the talk about Steelers need for a running back. I think our lineup of Connor, Snell, Samuels, Whyte is a nice committee of speed &amp; power. What they need is an OL to open more and bigger holes. Your take? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I wouldn’t use the top pick on a running back. I would go OL or TE because they are extreme news spots. But I would look for a veteran, cost-effective running back. If James Conner stays healthy they are fine at that position. But that is a huge if and I’m not impressed with any of the guys behind him</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Good morning Paul. Is it possible for the Steelers to use the transition tag on Dupree and the franchise tag on Hargrave? Thank you. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They would not do that with Hargrave because it would mean they are WAY over paying him. He isn’t that good. He is a nice player and they should sign him but not for that price</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Has JR's trades affected the Pens chemistry? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No, they lost three games in a row before the trade deadline. Again, good teams sometimes go through tough stretches</p>
<p><strong>Rick Sunner in Orlando</strong>: I think the Bucs start out slow and get better with our youngsters as the year goes on unlike last year where they were respectable until the implosion late last year. What say you? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It is hard to tell. You’d think the new manager would be a spark and they would come out of the gate with energy. The thing is 162 games don’t lie and this team will at some point play like a 65-win team</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/newsletters" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2018/10/10/Sports-Feed-redesign-newsletter-insert" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Carl</strong>: Paul, it seems more players are choosing to work out for individual teams or at their schools. Do you think the nfl combine may eventually become extinct? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No because there are only a few players who can call their shot like that. There are far more guys fighting for jobs and fighting to get drafted than superstars. If you are Joe Burrow you can dictate that. If you are a linebacker with a 4th round grade, you better get to the combine and work out</p>
<p><strong>Kirby Hogenmiller</strong>: Hey Paul! Are you concerned that Jake getting hurt may have been one injury too many? It just feels like the offense has been way too inconsistent since he’s been gone. There’s been some games where the offense has been fine but then we get slumps like the last four game. Also will Marino and Dumo coming back really fix everything? It’s gotten to the point where I’m expecting them to get hurt again or someone else every time someone gets healthy this season. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I do think the loss of Guentzel may be really difficult to overcome in the playoffs. He has one skill - scoring goals - that is a valued commodity. Like guys who hit homers, guys who score goals are worth their weight in golf and are somewhat rare. And it is clear they miss him often. In the playoffs when scoring becomes difficult that is a tough guy to be without.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: Importance of Big Ben getting some preseason, live-action snaps this year: very important, somewhat important, not important at all? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would say he needs more than he has had in the past. He will need to get a little of the rust off and also prove he can indeed make all the throws. I wouldn’t go crazy with him playing but he needs to play more than one or two series</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Paul - Do the Bucs realize that the goal is to win some games? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think so but don’t quote me on that!</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Hey Paul...any chance Steelers sign Alec Ogletree who was released by the Giants and let Dupree walk? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>Rick Sunner in Orlando</strong>: Don't look now but the hated Flyers are just 1 point behind the Pens for second and the other wildcard contenders are creeping up on them. Was this losing streak and bad play for the past month expected due to all the injuries or was the team reading the headlines about their possible Cup run and lost their focus and commitment to Sully's system? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It was expected because every team has millionaire stars, every team is capable of winning games and playing 82 times against professional teams means you will no doubt go through some stretches like this. I really think they are fine</p>
<p><strong>JuJu 2017</strong>: I'm JuJu Smith-Schuster, I want a new contract now. Why? I think I have earned it. Despite what others may say, I'm a #1 WR. Do you agree? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Nope. Go earn it this year then we will negotiate. Go prove you can do it without Antonio Brown</p>
<p><strong>STEEL72</strong>: Hey, Paul. Is there any way you see the Steelers finding a way back into the first round prior to the draft. Any trade scenario? Or future picks scenario? Or are they settled on the fact that it's pick #49? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They are right now picking No. 49. I can’t imagine the price it would take to get into the 20s. It doesn’t seem realistic. They would have to give up too much</p>
<p><strong>John from Guntown</strong>: Off topic, what are your top 5 musical groups/singers? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: A good way to wrap it up — Earth, Wind and Fire, Al Green, Michael Jackson, The Isley Brother, Journey and Stryper!!! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: OK that was six but who cares, thanks for participating and let’s do it again next week!!</p>
