<h1>Homewood man charged almost a year after fatal hit-in-run Downtown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A 41-year-old Homewood man has been charged nearly a year after a man was killed in a hit-in-run near PPG Paints Arena in the Central Business District of Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Bright was charged Sunday with accidents involving death, drivers required to be licensed, failure to stop and render aid, and driving while license is suspended, according to court records. Police believe he drove a&nbsp;blue 2008 Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan that struck and killed 55-year-old Michael May, of Charleroi, on Feb. 7, 2019.</p>
<p>Mr. May was hit in the 900 block of Fifth Avenue at Washington Place by a car that was traveling “at a high rate of speed,” witnesses told police. He had walked into traffic on Fifth Avenue against a steady green light, and suffered brain and facial injuries as well as several fractures after being hit, police said.</p>
<p>He died almost two weeks later at UPMC Mercy hospital on Feb. 19, a criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>The Chrysler involved in the accident sustained damage to the passenger front bumper and windshield area, a criminal complaint said. One of the mirrors and other pieces of the car were torn off in the impact and were collected by police at the scene.</p>
<p>It was later learned that Bright may have been driving his mother’s car when he struck Mr. May.</p>
<p>Police said sometime after the accident they obtained video which showed the license plate of the car involved in the fatal collision. Using license plate reader cameras, they <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;" data-mce-mark="1">discovered</span>&nbsp;the Chrysler on Feb. 21, 2019 traveling in the Fort Pitt Tunnels on 376 West — two days after Mr. May’s death, a criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>A woman later identified as Bright’s mother was driving the car at the time, police said.</p>
<p>The woman said in an interview with police the following day that she had reported her car stolen on Feb. 7 after realizing it wasn’t home when she awoke for work that evening. A second set of keys she keeps was also missing, she said. After calling her daughter that day and learning she had not taken her car, she filed a police report. Officials later found her car using GPS tracking about 300 feet from her daughter’s home at an impound lot in Swissvale.</p>
<p>When she retrieved the vehicle, it had sustained damage that she could not explain, police said. Authorities determined they had collected the same parts missing from her car, from the scene of the Feb. 7 collision.</p>
<p>Bright said in a May 20, 2019 interview with police that he had been at his sister’s home in Swissvale for most of the day during the collision. But a search warrant of all of their phones showed Bright’s phone was the only one that matched where his mother’s car had gone that day, a criminal complaint said. He also told police that his mother had lost second set her keys about two to three weeks prior to her car going missing.</p>
<p>Police said Bright suggested he might have left his phone in his mother’s car, but a tow slip did not show that a phone had been left in the car.&nbsp;In 2011, Bright pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and firearm charges. He has yet to be arrested for the latest.</p>
