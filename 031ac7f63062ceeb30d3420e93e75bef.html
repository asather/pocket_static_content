<p>“I Am Not Okay With This,” an original Netflix series shot in the Pittsburgh area, will not continue due to concerns of production during the pandemic.</p>
<p>It had previously been green-lit for a second season that well might have brought the production back here.</p>
<p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, Netflix killed the second season as well as that of another YA series,&nbsp;“The Society.” The trade said scripts had been completed for&nbsp;“I Am Not Okay With This,” a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2020/02/20/I-Am-Not-Okay-With-This-review-Netflix-Pittsburgh-Post-Gazette/stories/202002200025" target="_blank">coming-of-age story</a> about a teen with emerging superpowers amid the chaos of high school and a complex home life.</p>
<p>“I Am Not Okay With This” ended Season 1 with a blood-soaked cliffhanger: with Sydney (Sophia Lillis) about to discover the identity of a mysterious stranger who might know something about her unusual condition.</p>
<p>Directed by Jonathan Entwistle, it was based on the graphic novel by Chuck Forsman.</p>
