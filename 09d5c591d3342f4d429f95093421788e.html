<h1>City growers, food policy advocates show interest in Coghill's Brookline farm idea</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Picture it: A large field of crops pollinated by bees from a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/02/08/Brookline-Together-urban-redevelopment-authority-grant-community-garden-apiary-burgh-bees/stories/202002070113" target="_blank">nearby apiary</a>. School kids stopping by to learn how food is grown and harvested. Stormwater diverted from an aging sewer system and instead used to water plants. An access road to allow vehicles to haul away the donated produce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the urban-yet-bucolic scene that Councilman Anthony Coghill set as he convened a small crowd of 15 stakeholders in Brookline Memorial Park to discuss the possibility of a farm on the ground under their socially distanced chairs.</p>
<p>“I picture a little barn and a storage site here,” Mr. Coghill said, pointing to a section of the Brookline neighborhood park. “A fully functioning farm, maybe even a goat or two.”</p>
<p>“You got to have two,” Councilwoman Deb Gross chimed in. (Goats don’t do well solo.)</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed urban agriculture&nbsp; — as a weapon against food insecurity — to the front and center of city council business, replacing debate about the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/02/05/Pittsburgh-City-Council-parks-trust-fund-tax-increase-peduto-conservancy/stories/202002050126" target="_blank">parks tax</a> and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/04/Kraus-Pittsburgh-Zoo-reptile-crocodilian-gharial-red-eared-slider-turtles-regulations-ordinance-darlane-harris/stories/202003040129" target="_blank">crocodilian regulations</a>. (Those bills <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/18/Pittsburgh-City-Council-Allegheny-County-remote-virtual-meetings-COVID-19-coronavirus/stories/202003180126" target="_blank">have been held since mid-March</a>).</p>
<p>Three resolutions related to urban agriculture, including Mr. Coghill and Ms. Gross’s proposal to allocate $45,000 to the Brookline plot and other opportunities, will be on council’s agenda Tuesday for a final vote. The goal is&nbsp;“collective farming,” not individualized garden plots, and all produce would be donated, the council members emphasized.</p>
<p>“I just think that we’ve made a very strong point that the city of Pittsburgh wants to be ready for its residents in their time of need, and in providing healthy food. These are just some of the first steps,” said Council President Ms. Theresa Kail-Smith.&nbsp;“I don’t care who takes the lead, who gets credit, as long as it gets done. No egos, just food.”</p>
<p>Leaders from urban agriculture, land use and anti-hunger advocacy groups, including the Food Policy Council, Grounded (formerly GTECH) Strategies and Grow Pittsburgh, attended the meeting, alongside Ms. Kail-Smith, Public Works Director Mike Gable and City Planning Food Policy Adviser Shelly Danko Day.</p>
<p>While the plan is still&nbsp;“conceptual,” Mr. Gable said his department will&nbsp;“work with council members to help with whatever we can with whatever resources we have.” The department has already helped establish urban agriculture sites in other parts of the city, he said.</p>
<p>A lot is still unknown, including how much food the plot will produce and whether the planning and labor will be done in-house by the city or contracted out.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/29/Brookline-Memorial-Park-urban-farm-Pittsburgh-City-Council-Anthony-Coghill/stories/202004280100" target="_blank">city’s Law Department advised against</a> Mr. Coghill and Ms. Gross’s original plan to bypass the competitive bidding process and partner with Grounded Strategies.</p>
<p>“Whether or not the RFP [request for proposal] comes through for us, we’re still very interested in working with [Public Works] and the council to understand your entire city vacant land portfolio and what other uses can serve the community by using it,” said Ariam Ford-Graver, Grounded Strategies executive director.</p>
<p>Preliminary soil tests conducted on the site by Ms. Ford-Graver’s organization revealed lead readings 31 parts per million at the highest, a result that Ms. Gross said&nbsp;“flabbergasted” her, as readings in her district, which encompasses Lawrenceville, Bloomfield and Highland Park, reach into the thousands.</p>
<p>Ms. Danko Day added that by comparison lots in Larimer that are poised for lead remediation had readings of 6,000 parts per million.</p>
<p>“I think we have a golden opportunity here. I know we have some obstacles, some hurdles to get over, but if we want to do it, it’s here,” Mr. Coghill said.&nbsp;</p>
