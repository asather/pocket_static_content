<h1>Anthony Angello is back after Penguins recall him on emergency basis</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins on Tuesday recalled Anthony Angello on an emergency basis.</p>
<p>Angello, 23, has played seven games with the Penguins this season. The 6-foot-5 winger scored his first career NHL goal Feb. 18. That was his only point.</p>
<p>The Penguins sent Angello back to the American Hockey League on Feb. 24, hours after they acquired Patrick Marleau, Conor Sheary and Evan Rodrigues before the trade deadline. He was scoreless in three games in his most recent stint with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, posting a minus-5 rating over that span.</p>
<p>The reason for Angello’s emergency recall Tuesday was not announced.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan said Monday that Dominik Simon is week-to-week with an upper-body injury. Jared McCann dealt with an upper-body injury last week but suited up in the team’s most recent game and Monday’s practice. Brandon Tanev took a spill during Monday’s practice but finished the session.</p>
<p>The Penguins must have open roster spots available if they are to activate defensemen Brian Dumoulin and John Marino from injured reserve.</p>
<p>Sullivan, per usual, is scheduled to speak with reporters two hours before Tuesday’s game against the Ottawa Senators at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
