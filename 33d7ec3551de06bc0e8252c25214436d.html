<h1>Fishing Report: Heavy rains cloud waters as trout season opens</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Authorities advise anglers to stay at least the length of one fishing rod apart as a COVID-19 precaution.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County) Creeks emptied recent rain overflows into the bay, leaving fishing sporadic. Yellow perch took live minnows under floats. Catches of a few small Northern pike and smallmouth bass were reported.</p>
<p><strong>Pymatuning Reservoir</strong> (Crawford County) Prior to recent rains, anglers reported a slow crappie bite.</p>
<p><strong>Sandy Creek</strong> (Venango County) Fish and Boat reported that 95% of Venango County stocked trout waters had received pre-season stockings, and 85% had their in-season stockings as well.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Arthur</strong> (Butler County) Waters were still too cool for the crappie spawn. Males were caught using bright jigs above rocks in 10-15 feet of water.</p>
<p><strong>The Glades</strong> (Butler County) Bass and panfish were taken from shore in the waters of State Game Land 95.</p>
<p><strong>North Park Lake</strong> (Allegheny County) Anglers showed up but a thunderstorm put fish down. As mud clears, heavily stocked trout were expected to resume feeding.</p>
<p><strong>Keystone Lake</strong> (Westmoreland County) Lots of trout took live bait before Tuesday’s rain.</p>
<p><strong>Twin Lakes</strong> (Westmoreland County) Throughout the weekend, trout were caught using worms or meal worms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Loyalhanna Creek</strong> (Westmoreland County) Despite recent stockings, fishing was hampered by high, cloudy water.</p>
<p><strong>Killbuck Run</strong> (Cambria County) Running clear Wednesday despite Tuesday’s rains.</p>
<p><strong>Monongahela River</strong> (Washington, Greene counties) Waters were high and muddy throughout the region due to heavy storms early in the week.</p>
