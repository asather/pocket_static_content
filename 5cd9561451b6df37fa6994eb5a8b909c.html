<p>The Steelers signed former Penn State receiver Saeed Blacknall, who played with the Los Angeles Wildcats in the XFL earlier this spring.</p>
<p>Blacknall (6 foot 2, 210 pounds) signed as an undrafted free agent with the Raiders in 2018 after catching 50 passes for 979 yards and scoring seven touchdowns during his four seasons at Penn State. Blacknall played in one game with the Raiders as a rookie but spent most of the season on their practice squad. He spent time on the practice squad of the Arizona Cardinals in 2019 before signing with Los Angeles of the XFL.</p>
<p>Blacknall scored two touchdowns in the XFL before the season was cut short due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Blacknall, 24, is the fourth former XFL player this offseason to join with the Steelers, who previously signed defensive end Dewayne Hendrix, safety Tyree Kinnel and linebacker/long snapper Christian Kuntz.</p>
