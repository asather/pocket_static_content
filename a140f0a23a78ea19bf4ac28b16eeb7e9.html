<h1>Swearing-in now set for Uniontown treasurer who sued for racial bias</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A woman who was elected Uniontown treasurer but <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2020/01/08/uniontown-treasurer-federal-lawsuit-race-civil-rights-antoinette-hodge/stories/202001080113" target="_blank">claims that the city&nbsp;and two officials blocked her from taking office</a> because she is black&nbsp;will be sworn in next week.</p>
<p>Antoinette Hodge will be installed at a ceremony Monday at 5 p.m. in&nbsp;city council chambers, Uniontown Solicitor Tim Witt said Thursday.&nbsp;Mr. Witt said he confirmed that a $150,000 surety bond secured by Ms.&nbsp;Hodge to protect taxpayers from any possible malfeasance was in good&nbsp;order.&nbsp;That determination, he said, removed the roadblock to Ms. Hodge taking office.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Ms. Hodge sued Uniontown, Councilman Martin Gatti&nbsp;and Clerk Kimberly Marshall in U.S. District Court claiming violations&nbsp;of the First and 14th Amendments.&nbsp;Ms. Hodge, 50, is claiming that Mr. Gatti and Ms.&nbsp;Marshall, who she said are white, conspired against her due to racial&nbsp;discrimination. She was elected in November and was supposed to take&nbsp;office Monday but was prevented from doing so.</p>
<p>In her lawsuit, she claimed that Ms. Marshall delayed providing her&nbsp;with information necessary to take office and told her that “we’ll get&nbsp;you.”</p>
<p>Ms. Hodge accused Mr. Gatti of getting her surety bond canceled and&nbsp;claimed that he referred to her as “colored” in a phone call with the&nbsp;bond surety wholesale agency.</p>
<p>She also said two bond agency employees mentioned race to her in phone&nbsp;calls about her bond being revoked.&nbsp;The agency denied Ms. Hodge’s claims. The defendants did not return&nbsp;requests for comment. Ms. Hodge’s attorney could not be reached&nbsp;Thursday evening.</p>
