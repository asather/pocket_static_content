<h1>Car dealer accused of conspiracy with convicted killer gets fine, no prison</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A used car dealer who had been accused of helping convicted killer Price Montgomery buy his house from former Pittsburgh Steeler Deshea Townsend and to buy a car was sentenced Friday to pay a fine of $2,000.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak imposed no other sentence on Korry Pitts, who had pleaded guilty in the winter to a misdemeanor count of failing to report receipt of $25,000 in cash to the IRS for the car, an Audi Q5, that Montgomery drove.</p>
<p>Mr. Pitts, who owns 412 Motoring on Penn Avenue, had been charged in 2018 with laundering money for Montgomery, who is awaiting sentencing for killing federal witness Tina Crawford in 2014 to keep her from talking to federal prosecutors about his drug ring.</p>
<p>Crawford was a courier on trips to New Jersey to buy heroin.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Mr. Pitts conspired with Montgomery and two other men to launder drug money.</p>
<p>Trial testimony showed that Mr. Pitts helped broker a lease-to-own deal for Mr. Townsend's house on Mount Washington, where Montgomery lived, and another house in Ross that Townsend owned.</p>
<p>Mr. Pitts had also been accused of conspiracy in arranging purchase of the Audi, which Montgomery was driving when he was arrested.</p>
<p>Prosecutors had indicated in December that they would allow Mr. Pitts to plead to a misdemeanor count rather than a felony and would then file a motion to dismiss the 2018 money-laundering case.</p>
<p>They did that Friday and Judge Hornak granted the motion.</p>
