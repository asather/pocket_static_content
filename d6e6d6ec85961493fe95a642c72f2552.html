<h1>State releases guidelines on resuming elective surgeries</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The state health department released new guidelines allowing elective surgeries and procedures to resume at hospitals, state Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said at a Monday afternoon press conference.</p>
<p>The guidelines are in line with those released by the American Hospital Association, American College of Surgeons, and other groups, the secretary said. They dictate that elective procedures can only resume if they will not "jeopardize the safety of patients and staff."</p>
<p>"We know many Pennsylvanians have had to delay important elective procedures and operations," Dr. Levine said, "but it was necessary to ensure that our healthcare system had enough capacity in case it became overwhelmed with patients with COVID-19."</p>
<p>The guidelines recommend that facilities ensure that they have enough personal protective equipment stockpiled and trained staff to manage a "surge" in COVID-19 cases. Facilities should also not have to resort to "crisis standards of care" in the event of a surge.</p>
<p>"We've been working very closely with our hospital partners to safely ensure that Pennsylvanians who need treatment not related to COVID-19 can get it," Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>The decision has the potential to help the state better track the spread of the novel coronavirus. Secretary Levine said that hospitals would be asked to test anyone who schedules an elective procedure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“All of that data will be really, really useful for us,” Dr. Levine said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the press conference, the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) released an email statement praising the decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“HAP and its members look forward to continuing to work together with the Wolf Administration,” the statement read, “to ensure we are achieving the right balance between reducing COVID-19’s incidence and expanding access for Pennsylvania patients to essential health care services, including non-emergent surgeries and procedures.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania reported 885 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, bringing the statewide total to 42,050. The statewide death toll also rose to 1,597, an increase of 47 fatalities over the day before. Dr. Levine said that 47% of hospital beds, 40% of intensive care beds, and 70% of ventilators are still available across the state, though the harder-hit eastern part of the state has less excess capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
