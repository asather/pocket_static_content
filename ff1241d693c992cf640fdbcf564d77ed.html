<h1>Steelers lose member of front office to the Carolina Panthers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers are losing another one of their top front-office officials to the Carolina Panthers.</p>
<p>Samir Suleiman, the team’s football administration coordinator who managed the salary cap among other duties, will become the lead contract negotiator for the Panthers and owner David Tepper, a former Steelers investor. The hiring was to be announced today by the Panthers.</p>
<p>Suleiman is the second high-ranking person in the Steelers front office to be lured away by Tepper in the past 13 months. Mark Hart, who was vice president of planning and development with the Steelers, left in December 2018 to become vice president of development with the Panthers.</p>
<p>Suleiman joined the Steelers in 2013 after spending two years with the Jacksonville Jaguars (1998-99) and 10 years with the St. Louis Rams (2000-2009), the last five as director of football operations.</p>
<p>In addition to managing the salary cap, Suleiman also helped with player contract negotiations, team logistics and scouting.</p>
<p>When Steelers president Art Rooney II met with reporters last week he said he was “optimistic” that general manager Kevin Colbert would remain with the Steelers. Colbert, whose contract runs through the draft in April, has been targeted by Tepper over the past few months for a role with the Panthers.</p>
<p>“We have to get something done,” Rooney said. “The sooner, the better.”</p>
