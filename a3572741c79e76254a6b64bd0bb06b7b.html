<h1>Pirates spring training: Derek Holland finds a groove in starter's role</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. — Derek Holland had a nearly perfect pitching performance Thursday — other than about five pitches to former Pirate Austin Meadows. The All-Star outfielder took the first pitch he saw from Holland and deposited it into the Rays bullpen for a home run to lead off the bottom half of the first inning.</p>
<p>The quick home run by Meadows put a slight crimp in Holland's plans for working on his craft against a fellow lefty.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to worry about that. It was the first pitch of the ballgame," Holland said. "We were supposed to go fastball away and curveball and slider. I want to work on those things, especially against a lefy hitter like that. He didn't even let me get that far."</p>
<p>Yandy Diaz followed with a fly ball that prospect Jared Oliva quickly caught in center field. The left-hander then got soft contact from Yoshi Tsutsugo and Jose Martinez to end the frame.</p>
<p>The Pirates lost the game 2-1 to take their Grapefruit League record to 2-11-1. Results during spring training don't count, but seeing Holland go four innings and only giving up one hit with two walks is encouraging.</p>
<p>"We did exactly what we wanted to do today," Holland said. "I felt with my fastball. My off-speed use was great today. The curveball and changeup were throwing guys off. We did a good job of making hitters uncomfortable."</p>
<p>Holland credited the work with catcher Luke Maile for making the game flow smoothly.</p>
<p>"We had a good plan today," Holland said. "Other than the home run, which a pitch down the middle, we did some good work against a strong lineup."</p>
<p>Remember those other four pitches that Holland didn't like as much? It was a walk against Meadows in the second inning.</p>
<p>"I'm more upset about the walks than anything," Holland said. "I want to make sure that I'm making my pitches and getting a feel for them.</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>Holland walked Meadows with one out after striking out Willy Adames on a changeup in the third inning. Then Erik Gonzalez, in his first game back from foot surgery, fielded a ball from Diaz to start a double play. Gonzalez showed the type of range and arm strength that makes him a valuable defender.</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Chad Kuhl, Kyle Crick and Nick Burdi each threw shutout innings. Burdi had two strikeouts and his fastball was in the high 90s. Burdi has seven strikeouts in 3 2/3 innings this spring.</p>
<p>Kuhl looked composed and threw his pitches effectively.</p>
<p>Crick joined Kuhl and Burdi with three perfect frames. Each pitcher is returning from injuries, so seeing them get on the mound and get off healthy is a good sign with three weeks until opening day.</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>Josh Bell went 2-for-2 with two singles as the designated hitter. Bell has found a groove with four hits in his last seven at-bats and has reached base safely in five straight games.</p>
<p>Jason Martin showed a lot of speed on Thursday. He legged out a triple with ease in the fifth inning and later scored the only run of the game for the Pirates. Martin also stole a base.</p>
