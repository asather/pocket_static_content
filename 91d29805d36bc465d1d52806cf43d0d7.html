<h1>As COVID-19 hits MLB, the Pirates hope their protocols are good enough</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This 60-game Major League Baseball season has been described as a sprint.</p>
<p>It may also be filled with sudden pauses, during which everyone checks over their shoulders to make sure it’s safe to proceed amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>That’s the case right now after the Miami Marlins had 14 people, a mix of staff and players, test positive for the coronavirus. Their game against the Baltimore Orioles on Monday is postponed, and reports suggest that Tuesday’s game is, too. The Marlins’ opponents from over the weekend, the Philadelphia Phillies, have also postponed their game against the New York Yankees.</p>
<p>What that means for the 26 teams that are not directly involved in this outbreak is in question. For now, the season is not canceled, as the Pirates entered their home opener Monday evening against the Milwaukee Brewers as planned.</p>
<p>“I think what it boils down to is that we have to follow the protocols ... and we have to continue to educate ourselves,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “I think we all knew at some point there was going to be some sort of positive testing with the group. I think we continue to evaluate and find information out. Most importantly, just continue to make sure that we’re abiding by everything they’ve put in place. There’s so many different factors of when we travel and how things go, and we have to be aware and we have to continue to learn what’s going on.”</p>
<p>That is all that can be done right now from the Pirates’ perspective. As long as there is a season, there will be some level of risk.</p>
<p>Five Pirates have tested positive for COVID-19 so far. Outfielder Socrates Brito and third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes were each cleared, and both are working out in Altoona. Right fielder Gregory Polanco was cleared quite recently and spent the weekend working out at PNC Park. When he will rejoin the Pirates is uncertain, but it seems likely to be soon.</p>
<p>Those are concerning instances, but it isn’t like what the Marlins are dealing with. The best the Pirates can hope for is that the measures they are taking continue to be successful as they mitigate any potential spread of the virus.</p>
<p>But as is the case with the Phillies, who couldn’t necessarily control the Marlins’ outbreak, even that may not be enough.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s unsettling,” Shelton said. “I think we just have to have trust in the fact that people are going to follow the protocols. Honestly, our group has been really good. Knock on wood – superstitious, so we’ll knock on wood there. You just have to continue to be mindful of it. We can’t control what other people do, but we have to just trust that everybody is following those protocols.”</p>
<p>Players are positioned during games to optimize social distancing, with tents set up in the stands to seat those who aren’t in the game.&nbsp;Left-hander Derek Holland said that when the Pirates were on the road in St. Louis this weekend, they all just stayed in the hotel, kept to themselves and only traversed to Busch Stadium and back.</p>
<p>The question becomes, however, whether that is good enough. It is still undisclosed how the virus first entered the Marlins’ clubhouse.</p>
<p>What is known is that, despite three players testing positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, the Marlins players decided collectively to play their game against the Phillies that day. Now, it has spread more widely.</p>
<p>Shelton said he feels that there will likely be more protocols laid out for MLB teams, though he isn’t sure what they will be. If that does happen, the onus is on the players and coaches to make sure those protocols are followed as closely as possible to finish this sprint of a season.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a culmination of everybody, but ultimately, it comes down to the players,” Shelton said. “The players have to be responsible for themselves because they’re grown men and they’re making decisions, and we’re asking them to make the decisions that are not only accountable for themselves, but for our families and our kids and our wives and everybody else. So that’s what it really comes down to.</p>
<p>“As we’ve talked about enough, I can’t credit Todd [Tomczyk] and our medical staff enough for the education process they have and staying on top of it, but it’s no one’s responsibility but ourselves to monitor these situations. And because of everything we don’t know about the virus, it’s so hard, how it continues to grow or what continues to happen with it. I think [we] just have to be as aware as possible.”</p>
