<h1>Mike White's top high school sports moments at Three Rivers Stadium</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>One in an ongoing series commemorating Three Rivers Stadium, which opened 50 years ago:</em></p>
<p>A national high school championship won. A tie playoff game decided by yardage totals. A no-hitter in a baseball championship. A pitcher throwing nearly 200 pitches in 12 innings of a title game.</p>
<p>Those are some of the most memorable games and moments in high school football and baseball contests at Three Rivers Stadium. This month marks the 50-year anniversary of the opening of the venue, and the WPIAL, City League and old Catholic League all had championships played at the circle on the North Side.</p>
<p>The first WPIAL football championship was played at Three Rivers in 1970, but the league didn’t have another title staged there until 1983. Many Western Pennsylvania high school greats played in the WPIAL title games at Three Rivers, including a Pro Football Hall of Famer (Aliquippa’s Ty Law) and four first-round NFL draft picks - Law, North Hills’ LaVar Arrington, Aliquippa’s Sean Gilbert and Mt. Lebanon’s Brian Williams.</p>
<p>The WPIAL also played some baseball championships at Three Rivers, the first in 1971. Overall, nine WPIAL baseball title games were played at Three Rivers.</p>
<p>Here are some memorable games, performances, odd moments and comments from high school games played at Three Rivers:</p>
<p><strong>The greatest game?</strong></p>
<p>Many believe the greatest WPIAL football title game at Three Rivers Stadium came in 1986, when Gateway played North Hills in the Class 4A final, one year after the two battled to a scoreless tie in the title game. The week of the 1986 title game, North Hills moved to the No. 1 team in the country, according to USA Today. A crowd estimated at 25,000 watched the two 12-0 teams battle, and Gateway edged North Hills, 7-6. North Hills scored with two seconds left. There was not overtime back then, and North Hills wanted a win. But a two-point conversion pass was intercepted. An iconic Post-Gazette photo from that night showed Gateway coach Pete Antimarino and his son (Peter Jr.) on their knees on the sideline, praying before the two-point conversion.</p>
<p><strong>More yards wins</strong></p>
<p>The most unusual finish to a WPIAL football playoff game came in a 1972 semifinal at Three Rivers. Jeannette and Monessen were tied, 14-14, after regulation, but there was no overtime procedure back then, so the WPIAL played the numbers game. The WPIAL ruled the winner would be decided by total yardage. Joe Mucci was Jeannette’s coach in 1972 and was quoted years later as saying everyone at the stadium was looking up to the press box when the game ended. “Apparently, there was someone up there from the WPIAL. Between that person and various sportswriters covering the game, they came up with the total yardage,” Mucci said. “Then somehow or other, they announced it on the public address system.” Jeannette was declared the winner.</p>
<p><strong>National champs in 1987</strong></p>
<p>A high school national championship was won at Three Rivers — even if it was a “mythical” title. The 1987 North Hills football team was USA Today’s No. 1-ranked team in the country since the start of the season, and the Indians won the WPIAL Class 4A title with a 21-0 victory against Mt. Lebanon. There is no national championship for high school football, but North Hills was declared the No. 1 team in the country. North Hills gave up only 20 points all season in 13 games, and the first-team defense did not allow a point.</p>
<p><strong>No-hitter for Walker</strong></p>
<p>The 1998 WPIAL Class 2A championship was the first baseball title game at Three Rivers in 23 years. Washington’s Diontae Walker made it memorable, pitching a no-hitter in the Little Prexies’ 7-0 victory against Freeport. The win lifted Walker’s record to 6-0, but he had never pitched more than four innings in a game all season before the title game. Walker struck out four and walked five.</p>
<p><strong>The narrow posts</strong></p>
<p>Through the 1980s and part of the 1990s, any WPIAL football championships at Three Rivers were played on NFL-size goal posts and with NFL hash marks on the field. It became a controversial subject, especially since then WPIAL director Charles “Ace” Heberling didn’t think it was necessary to use high school-size goal posts, which are almost 5 feet wider. The NFL goal posts cost North Hills a WPIAL title in 1985. The Indians and Gateway tied, 0-0, and there was no overtime back then. North Hills’ T.J. Osman had a field goal hit the upright during a game — and the kick would have been good with high school goal posts.</p>
<p><strong>Four in one</strong></p>
<p>In 1986, the WPIAL had a first — four championships in one day at one place. It was the idea of Heberling. The four games drew a total attendance of a little more than 34,000.</p>
<p><strong>Home for the Catholic League</strong></p>
<p>In 1971, Three Rivers Stadium was the home for the old Pittsburgh Catholic League. The Catholic League had 17 games scheduled at Three Rivers that year, most of them doubleheaders on Saturday afternoons. The five teams in the Catholic League then were Central Catholic, North Catholic, Canevin, Bishop McCort and South Hills Catholic (now Seton LaSalle). The Catholic League is no longer in existence, folding when the Catholic teams joined the WPIAL in the 1970s.</p>
<p><strong>Pitching 12 innings</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a high school pitcher throwing almost 200 pitches and working 12 innings. It happened in the WPIAL baseball championship in 1972. Back then, there were no pitch-count limits or innings pitched rule, and Montour’s Jeff Panizzi pitched all 12 innings in the Spartans’ 3-1 victory against Penn Hills at Three Rivers. He struck out four and walked 12. He pitched four innings in the semifinals two days earlier — 16 innings in three days. Penn Hills’ Scott Edgar, who became Duquesne University’s men’s basketball coach 23 years later, pitched the first six-plus innings for Penn Hills.</p>
<p><strong>13-inning title game</strong></p>
<p>In the 1975 WPIAL baseball title game at Three Rivers, Beaver Falls and California played 12 scoreless innings before Beaver Falls scored a run in the 13th inning for a 1-0 victory. Dave Hornacek scored the winning run on a wild pitch in the 13th. The game is still tied for the longest in WPIAL championship history.</p>
<p><strong>First title game</strong></p>
<p>The first football championship game played at Three Rivers was the 1970 Catholic League championship on the first Friday of November. North Catholic crushed Central Catholic, 33-7, in front of 10,800 fans. Fred Zangaro ran for 134 yards in the game and set a North Catholic record for single-season rushing with 1,078 yards.</p>
<p><strong>A Lovie story</strong></p>
<p>The first City League championship at Three Rivers was played in 1970, eight days after the Catholic League championship. And it was a lovely experience for Lovie. Westinghouse running back Lovie Venson rushed for 258 yards on 41 carries in a 26-6 victory against Carrick. The 258 yards ended up as the second-most ever in a championship at Three Rivers. Blackhawk’s Nate Stewart rushed for 262 yards in the 1996 WPIAL Class 3A final.</p>
<p><strong>First and last</strong></p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon, under coach Art Walker, won the first WPIAL championship at Three Rivers Stadium in 1970 when it defeated Kiski Area, 35-12. Thirty years later, Mt. Lebanon won the final WPIAL championship at Three Rivers. Mt. Lebanon, coached by Chris Haering, beat Woodland Hills, 14-13. A botched extra point by Woodland Hills with 39 seconds left was the difference in the game.</p>
<p><strong>King of quotes</strong></p>
<p>Aliquippa’s run on WPIAL championships began at Three Rivers in 1984, only after some championship heartbreaks. Aliquippa lost in the WPIAL 3A title games three times in four seasons from 1980-83. One of the losses was to Mount Pleasant in 1983, and always colorful, forever quotable Aliquippa coach Don Yannessa said immediately after the game, “We’ve got the copper trophy three times now. I think I’m going to melt them down into copper bullets and shoot myself.” When Aliquippa finally broke through and won a title in 1984 (the school’s first since 1964), Yannessa was asked outside a Three Rivers Stadium locker room what he was going to do with the championship trophy. “There’s going to be three of us in bed tonight,” Yannessa said. “My wife, me and the trophy.”</p>
