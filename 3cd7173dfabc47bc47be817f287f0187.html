<h1>Penguins acquire Patrick Marleau ahead of trade deadline</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hours before the NHL’s trade deadline, the Penguins added one more piece to their puzzle, acquiring veteran forward Patrick Marleau from the San Jose Sharks.</p>
<p>In exchange, the Penguins will send a conditional third-round pick to the Sharks. The pick will become a second-round draft choice should the Penguins win the Stanley Cup.</p>
<p>Marleau, 40, is signed through the 2019-20 season with a contract that carries an average annual value of $700,000, making him an affordable, veteran rental for the stretch run.</p>
<p>“Patrick is a player who can play anywhere in our lineup,” Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said in a statement. “He’s a good two-way player, provides leadership and will be a good fit with our team.”</p>
<p>Marleau was drafted second overall by the Sharks in the 1997 draft and has gone on to become the franchise’s all-time leader in goals. After playing his first 19 seasons in San Jose, Marleau played two years in Toronto before returning to his roots last offseason. This season, Marleau has posted 10 goals and 20 points for a struggling Sharks team that is out of the playoff conversation at 26-32-4.</p>
<p>In his accomplished career, Marleau has climbed the ladder in many of the NHL’s all-time lists. He sits at fifth all-time with 1,715 games played, including an ironman streak of 846 consecutive games. He also ranks 25th in NHL history in goals (561), 80th in assists (625) and 50th in points (1,186).</p>
<p>However, despite all these stats and accolades, has never hoisted the Stanley Cup. The closest he got was in 2016 when the Penguins defeated his Sharks in the Cup final. Now, he’ll be on the other side, trying to help Pittsburgh make another postseason run.</p>
<p>How will the Penguins use him? It remains to be seen, but going into deadline day, they were looking to add a little bit of bite to their bottom six. The left-shooting Marleau can play center but is more likely to slot in as a winger.</p>
<p>Marleau is a player who is strong in what Mike Sullivan likes to call the “battle areas.” He’s also a solid net-front presence and a power play candidate, likely on the second unit.</p>
