<h1>Pitt guard Justin Champagnie helps deliver win against Georgia Tech</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Justin Champagnie wasn’t everywhere Saturday for Pitt -- the laws of space and time limit him in a way Georgia Tech couldn’t -- but it would be hard to blame someone for thinking he was.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-6 freshman impacted the Panthers’ game in conceivably every way he could -- grabbing rebounds, blocking shots, connecting with open teammates and, above all else, knocking down shots -- and by the end of their 73-64 victory against Georgia Tech, he stood as the biggest reason why they collected their 15th win of the season.</p>
<p>Champagnie finished with a career-high 30 points, made 12 of his 17 shots and pieced together the best game of what has, through 24 games, already been an excellent freshman season. He also finished with a team-high nine rebounds.</p>
<p>With the victory, Pitt surpassed its victory total from last season, with seven games still remaining in its regular season.</p>
<p>Champagnie’s production came in handy in a way that, at one point, it didn’t seem like it would need to. With 10 minutes remaining, Pitt led by nine, 50-41, after a layup from Au’Diese Toney, giving it its largest advantage of the game to that point.</p>
<p>Just as quickly as it was built, it disappeared. Over a stretch of just 127 seconds, the Yellow Jackets tied the game, holding their opponent scoreless while rattling off nine points, five of which came from leading scorer Michael Devoe.</p>
<p>The Panthers (15-9, 6-7 ACC) recovered, regaining a single-possession lead, and with the game entering its decisive minutes, they pulled away for good. Leading by three, 60-57, after Devoe finished off a three-point play with 3:22 remaining, they got an off-hand driving layup from Trey McGowens, followed on the next drive by a pair of Xavier Johnson free throws. By the time Champagnie added four points across the next two possessions, Pitt’s lead was up to 11 and the game was, for all intents and purposes, over.</p>
<p>Playing without guard Ryan Murphy, who missed his third consecutive game with a concussion, the Panthers were thin, particularly in the backcourt. They needed some big performances from players logging the most minutes and for the most part, they got that, even beyond Champagnie.</p>
<p>McGowens (14 points) and Johnson (11) also finished in double figures while adding nine and seven assists, respectively. McGowens’ assist total was a career high and Johnson finished with no turnovers. Both players, with none of their traditional options left on the bench to spell them if they needed it, finished with at least 38 minutes, with Johnson playing the entire game.</p>
<p>Pitt shot 42.1% from the field and 31.3% from 3-point range, with Champagnie accounting for 12 of its 24 made shots and three of its five 3s. It was enough to overcome another somewhat disappointing defensive showing, one in which it allowed a usually lethargic Georgia Tech offense to shoot 48% from the field and 37.5% from 3.</p>
<p>As several of their games have gone this season, Saturday’s contest started off slow for the Panthers, who missed eight of their first nine shots and fell behind, 12-4. From there, however, they encountered an offense that struggles to score more than their own -- Georgia Tech’s. After seizing that eight-point advantage, the Yellow Jackets made just two shots and scored only four points over the next 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Pitt pounced on the opportunity, scoring 19 points during that drought, with nine of those points coming from center Terrell Brown.</p>
<p>The Panthers return to action Wednesday with a home game against Clemson.</p>
