<h1>Bellevue store owner indicted on federal fraud charges</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A part-owner of a Bellevue store has been indicted on fraud charges in connection with a scheme to buy stolen goods from drug abusers and resell them on Amazon.</p>
<p>Thach Duc Le, owner of Last Call Entertainment on Lincoln Avenue, is accused of buying goods that he knew were stolen, mostly over-the-counter medications such as Prilosec and health and beauty aids such as tooth whitening strips, electric toothbrushes and cosmetics.</p>
<p>The grand jury said said Mr. Le, known as "Tucker," bought the goods from people he knew were substance abusers and had shoplifted the items from other retailers such as drug stores.</p>
<p>Mr. Le, who has residences in Venetia, Pa., and Davie, Fla., is charged with wire fraud and money-laundering.</p>
<p>The grand jury handed up the indictment on Tuesday and prosecutors announced it today. No attorney was listed for Mr. Le in court records. The indictment indicates that three other people co-own the store, but only Mr. Le is named as a defendant.</p>
<p>The grand jury said that from 2013 to 2016, Mr. Le accepted the stolen goods and sold them through amazon.com using an account called "fastshipelectronicsoutlet." Customers bought the stolen items and Mr. Le shipped them through the U.S. mail, the grand jury said. Every two weeks, amazon.com collected the money from multiple sales on the fastshipelectronicsoutlet and wired the funds to a Citizens Bank account Mr. Le controlled.</p>
<p>He is set to appear for arraignment before U.S. Magistrate Judge Maureen Kelly on June 30.</p>
