<h1>Pittsburgh police annual report shows slight drop in crime</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Police released their annual statistical report for 2019, showing that the total amount of crime in the city decreased overall from 2018.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Police have released annual reports since 2009, as an attempt to demonstrate their “commitment to transparency.”</p>
<p>Crimes are separated into two categories, Part 1 and Part 2, based on Federal Uniform Crime Reporting Standards. Part 1 is comprised of eight “index crimes”; four violent crimes, which include murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, and four property crimes, burglary, theft, vehicle theft and arson. Part 2 includes more common, but statistically less likely to be reported crimes, such as simple assault, vandalism and disorderly conduct.</p>
<p>The grand total amount of crimes reported to Pittsburgh Police went down from 26,254 in 2018 to 24,787 in 2019, with reductions in almost every crime type.</p>
<p>The total number of violent crimes also slightly decreased from year to year, with 1,585 in 2018 and 1,565 in 2019. Almost all Part 1 violent crimes decreased from 2018 to 2019, from 57 to 37 murders, 93 to 81 rapes and 703 to 652 robberies, respectively. Only aggravated assault increased, from 732 in 2018 to 795 in 2019.</p>
<p>The report notes however that crime statistics are not 100% accurate reflections of the rate of crimes committed, because they only represent reported crimes. It also notes that Part 1 violent crimes are more likely to be reported than Part 2 property crimes.</p>
