<h1>Presenting the different looks and personalities of the world's top 10 cats</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The big blue eyes and plush coat of the&nbsp;“ragdoll” made that breed the most popular cat in the world in 2019, according to the Cat Fanciers’ Association, Inc. The organization keeps track of these things and registers 45 pedigree breeds.</p>
<p>The registrations come from around the world, which is how the ragdoll has come to be No. 1. Though most people in this country have never seen one unless they go to CFA shows, ragdolls are immensely popular in China, where registrations increased 25 percent over the previous year.</p>
<p>One of the most recognizable cat breeds is the Persian, which have luxurious, long coats and expressive eyes set in flat-ish faces. Those cats are No. 4 in the world, but No. 1 in the U.S., CFA reports.</p>
<p>Rounding out the rest of the top 10 worldwide list, released by CFA this month, is: No. 2: exotic. No. 3: British shorthair. No. 5: Maine coon. No. 6: Devon rex. No. 7: American shorthair. No. 8: Abyssinian. No. 9: sphynx and No. 10: Scottish fold.</p>
<p>CFA, the largest registry of purebred cats, is based in Alliance, Ohio, near Cleveland. To its credit, the organization is not exclusively about purebreds.</p>
<p>“No need to worry if the cat on your lap doesn’t fit into the top 10 this year,” says the CFA news release.&nbsp;“Ninety five percent of the world’s cat population is rescue, stray or household&nbsp;‘non-pedigree’ cats. CFA, which has been preserving, celebrating and protecting cats since 1906, embraces those cats.”</p>
<p>“Every cat has a place in the fancy,” says CFA president Mark Hannon.&nbsp;“We welcome family felines to join Companion Cat World, which is quickly becoming one of the most popular class of cats.”</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.cfa.org/ccw" target="_blank">www.cfa.org/ccw</a>&nbsp;to learn more. A $13 lifetime membership includes benefits such as the ability to compete at CFA cat shows. The site explains how to enter shows.</p>
<p>At the annual Steel City Kitties show, the “household pets” competition is popular with spectators, and owners always are thrilled with the ribbons their cats win.</p>
<p>CFA apparently disapproves of declawing cats, because the rules do not allow declawed cats to compete. The rules do allow neutered males and spayed females to compete for ribbons and championship titles.</p>
<p>The different breeds have distinct personalities that set them apart. Cat buyers should do research before picking a breed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ragdolls are affectionate, laid back and one of the larger breeds, with males weighing 15 to 20 pounds. They’re also one of the newer breeds, having been developed in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Exotics were developed in the 1960s to look like the Persian cat, but with a shorter dense, plush coat&nbsp;that CFA says&nbsp;“gives them a soft teddy-bear look.”</p>
<p>The British shorthair, by contrast, is one of the oldest breeds. Their ancestry can be traced to the domestic cats of Rome. They are easily trained and&nbsp;“very adaptable.” They are very affectionate but&nbsp;“usually not fond of being carried.”</p>
<p>Persian cats have been depicted in art work dating back to 1684 BC. They are&nbsp;“playful but never demanding” and they&nbsp;“love to pose.”</p>
<p>Maine coons are CFA’s&nbsp;“gentle giants,” with males weighing 25 pounds or more. Their coats and tails are long and their friendly, affectionate personalities make them popular with cat show spectators. One of their many endearing traits is their ability to get along with dogs.</p>
<p>The Devon rex is a cat like no other. The CFA profile describes its personality as&nbsp;“dog-like.” Their bodies are small —&nbsp; 6 to 9 pounds — but their ears and eyes are large, which makes them resemble the lead character of “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.” Their coats can be curly or a suede-like down.</p>
<p>A large contingent of Devon rex converged on the 2017 Steel Kitties show, where they dominated the costume contest. It seems the sometimes-clownish cats love to show off by wearing costumes, including large-brimmed hats and in one case, a 1920-style flapper dress.</p>
<p>The American shorthair looks much like many pet cats. Records indicate that these cats traveled from Europe to North America aboard the Mayflower.</p>
<p>The elegant Abyssinian appears in ancient Egyptian art. The sphynx is hairless. The Scottish fold has distinctive ears that fold forward and down.&nbsp;</p>
