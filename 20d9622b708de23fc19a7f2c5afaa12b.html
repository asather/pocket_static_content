<h1>Cam Heyward, Mike Tomlin and more honored at 84th Dapper Dan awards</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cam Heyward always dreamed of being a Steeler.</p>
<p>That dream has been a reality for the last nine seasons, and on Monday, Heyward joined some of Pittsburgh’s great sports figures at the Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh Downtown, where Heyward was named the 2019 Sportsman of the Year at the 84th annual Dapper Dan Dinner &amp; Sports Auction.</p>
<p>It was the furthering of where Heyward has always wanted to be, playing for his hometown team, in the same city where his father, Craig&nbsp;“Ironhead” Heyward, was an All-American while playing at Pitt.</p>
<p>“When I look back at when I got drafted, we were in my basement, and [my family was] all there, my agent included,” Heyward said in his acceptance speech.&nbsp;“And I think back, that night was crazy. I’m waiting around, seeing who was going to call. We never thought [Pittsburgh] was going to call. And it’s funny how it happens. I think my dad had a lot of work upstairs going on getting this all done, but that moment will always live with me.</p>
<p>“Seeing ‘412’ come across the screen and knowing that [my family] were there and [the Steelers] were on the other side of that phone call, that means a lot to me. I’m just very honored to be up here.”</p>
<p>Joining Heyward in receiving awards on Monday night were his coach, Mike Tomlin, legendary play-by-play broadcaster Bill Hillgrove and the Pitt women’s volleyball team.</p>
<p>Hillgrove’s honor was perhaps the most prestigious, as he received the Lifetime Achievement Award. And after more than 50 years on play-by-play, that is a well-deserved honor.</p>
<p>Hillgrove began his career calling play-by-play for Pitt basketball games in 1969. He then added Pitt football to his repertoire in 1974 before his foray into the Steelers’ booth in 1994. Before giving his acceptance speech, a video of some of Hillgrove’s most famous radio calls was played for the audience. They ranged from Pitt upsets over Clemson and West Virginia to his calls of the Steelers’ last two Super Bowl wins in 2006 and 2009.</p>
<p>All told, the video served to highlight the long and beloved career Hillgrove has had serving as the voice of some of the biggest sports moments in recent Pittsburgh history.</p>
<p>“I accept this very humbly, with great honor and with a sense of pride,” Hillgrove said. “How do I say it? My greatest achievement has been to be able to stay in my hometown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and play to the greatest fans in the world. Am I full of pride? Yes. But before I get too swelled with pride and get that big head, I think of the words of the late, great Chuck Tanner. The size of your funeral will depend on the weather that day.”</p>
<p>Rounding out the trio of Steelers representatives was Tomlin.</p>
<p>At this point, it can be said that Tomlin is a stalwart in the Pittsburgh sports community, as his 13 seasons at the helm of the Steelers makes him the third-longest tenured head coach in the NFL.</p>
<p>This was the second time Tomlin has been honored at the Dapper Dan. Years ago, at the beginning of his tenure, Tomlin was named the 2008 Sportsman of the Year after leading the Steelers to a victory in Super Bowl XLIII.</p>
<p>“The longer you’re in a place in our business, you really get an opportunity to gain real perspective. The perspective that I’ve gained over the 13 years here is just one of extreme appreciation,” Tomlin said.</p>
<p>He went on to list Dapper Dan, the Steelers organization, his players and coaches, and the other award winners from Monday night as things he has grown to fully appreciate.</p>
<p>Then there was the entire Pitt volleyball team, who were named the 2019 Sportswomen of the Year. The Panthers spent much of the 2019 season ranked near the top of the nation, ultimately earning the No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament with a 30-2 overall record.</p>
<p>Though the season didn’t necessarily end how Pitt wanted it to — the Panthers fell in the second round of the NCAA Tournament to Cincinnati — Pitt is still proud after putting together won of the best seasons in its history.</p>
<p>“This is my seventh year in Pittsburgh and third year coming here, and I definitely know what this award means to the community,” coach Dan Fisher said.&nbsp;“This award and this season was the culmination of seven years of work that my staff and I put in.”</p>
<p>The Panthers received heaps of praise from all the other award winners, including Heyward, who told Fisher he needs to get his daughters out to a volleyball game at Pitt. He then asked Fisher to wait 15 years to start recruiting Heyward’s daughters, and Fisher responded with a joking handshake.</p>
<p>While a light moment, it fits squarely into something mentioned in Heyward’s own speech, as he gave kudos to Hillgrove.</p>
<p>“Playing for my dream school and then dream team in the NFL, I’m just very thankful to be in this position,” Heyward said.&nbsp;“Hopefully I’m around long enough to be a Lifetime Award winner like Bill.”&nbsp;</p>
