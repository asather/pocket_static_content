<p>Dr. Vicenta Gaspar-Yoo, 56, admits she was an odd kid. Nearly everyone else who grew up in the Philippines in the 1960s and ’70s couldn’t wait to finish school and get a job or get married.</p>
<p>“I wanted to study some more,” the president of Allegheny Valley Hospital in Harrison says.</p>
<p>Born in the Chinese year of the dragon, she is the oldest of three children and says her ambitions were molded in early childhood by her family. Her grandmother was a professor of home economics and her father a civil engineer and president of a construction company. And her only aunt, “a second mother to me,” was a doctor.</p>
<p>“I had to make a choice between home economics and medicine,” Vicenta says.</p>
<p>Though she loves to cook adobo and other Filipino dishes, it wasn’t really close.</p>
<p>She received her medical degree in physical medicine and rehabilitation from the University of the East Medical Center in Manila and did an internship at Crozer-Chester Medical Center near Philadelphia under the watchful eye of her aunt. Dr. Victoria Gaspar trained hundreds of rehab specialists over many years at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>When Vicenta got a residency at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh, her Aunt Victoria was pleased — and a little concerned.</p>
<p>“She had hesitations,” Vicenta says. “I’d heard about it being a steel town, always gray skies, and the pollution.”</p>
<p>Imagine the 28-year-old’s surprise, then, when her new home was rated the most livable city.</p>
<p>“So I lucked out,” she says. “It was a fun place to train.”</p>
<p>After her residency, Vicenta moved back to Manila for two years. Then love and family brought her back. She and her husband, neurosurgeon Dr. Bo Yoo, settled in Sandusky, Ohio, and began raising three children, Lia, Trixie and PJ. Vicenta ran a private practice and went back to school.</p>
<p>“Residency does not prepare you for the business side of medicine,” she says. “I wanted to run my practice well. That’s why I got my MBA, to be the best version of me.”</p>
<p>A master’s degree in business administration from Case Western Reserve University’s Weatherhead School of Management put her on a different career path that began with leadership posts at Firelands Regional Medical Center in Sandusky and continued at University Hospitals Health System in Cleveland.</p>
<p>In June of last year, Vicenta was named president of Allegheny Valley, one of eight hospitals in the Allegheny Health Network. She is the network’s fourth physician president, joining Drs. Christopher Clark of Saint Vincent Hospital, Mark Rubino of Forbes Hospital and David Parda of Allegheny General Hospital. She is proud to be part of a “paradigm shift” toward doctors as hospital administrators.</p>
<p>“It’s one of the most important reasons why I joined AHN,” Vicenta says. “It’s an environment where physicians have a big voice. It sends a message.”</p>
<p>The loudest message is directed at doctors, who need to “buy in” to her leadership.</p>
<p>“We speak the same language,” she says. “We share the same decision-making skills. We share the same goal: What is patient-centric?”</p>
<p>She appears to be the first Filipina to run an American hospital.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be cool if I was the first?” she says, laughing.</p>
<p>It’s especially cool to members of the local Filipino community and to Allegheny Valley’s four Filipina nurses.</p>
<p>“They’re 20 years younger than I am,” Vicenta says. “When I see them in the emergency room, I talk to them in our native native language. I think it gives them some comfort.”</p>
<p>Everyone could use a little comfort these days, especially at a small suburban hospital trying to remain in business while treating patients, some with COVID-19, and keeping the highly contagious virus from spreading. Vicenta says Allegheny Valley never has more than five patients with the novel coronavirus that triggers COVID-19. Her biggest challenges are having enough personal protective equipment and maintaining hospital morale on the front lines of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“I go to the ER as much as I can and thank them,” Vicenta says. “Every day, I join the daily huddle to get the pulse of the hospital.”</p>
<p>Even on days off, she is in constant contact with hospital employees.</p>
<p>“You don’t really have days off. You’re always on call,” she says.</p>
<p>When she can, Vicenta returns to Cleveland to decompress with her family. She likes to cook with her grandmother’s recipe books from the 1920s, saying, “They’re like gold for me.”</p>
<p>She does make a few changes, using less salt, for instance. She is a doctor, after all.</p>
<p>She and her husband, who is from South Korea, enjoy French wines. A few years ago, they took their children to the Burgundy and Bordeaux regions. Family vacations are the best way to decompress, she says, but she won’t be taking any for a while.</p>
<p>Vicenta returns each night to a condominium in Downtown Pittsbugh near Point State Park. She moved in a month ago, when the pandemic first reached Western Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s walkable and safe,” she says. “But it feels weird that Downtown is so empty.”</p>
