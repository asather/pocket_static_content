<h1>After World Down Syndrome Day relay postponed, Pittsburgh mom selling masks for cause </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gina Mannion was preparing to run in her second <a href="https://www.ndss.org/run321/" target="_blank">Run 3.21</a> relay on World Down Syndrome Day when it was postponed only days before its March 21 scheduled date due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Stanton Heights mother of four has been an active participant in races and relays over the last 13 years, since giving birth to her daughter, Maeve, who has Down syndrome. Last year Run 3.21 took Ms. Mannion and dozens of other <a href="https://www.ndss.org/" target="_blank">National Down Syndrome Society</a> members <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/lifestyle/2019/03/17/runners-relay-down-syndrome-3-21-race-NDSS-virtual-event/stories/201903170170" target="_blank">on a course from Washington D.C. to New York City </a>as they raised money for awareness about the condition that affects about one in every 700 babies born in the U.S., according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>But once this year’s 250-mile, two-day relay that was set to go between the same two cities but in opposite directions was pushed to September, Ms. Mannion thought of another way to fundraise for the cause that is so near and dear to her family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Up until about three days before I was supposed to leave for New York, we were still on. We were still planning and then it was a last minute, ‘We have to postpone,’ ” Ms. Mannion said Monday.&nbsp;“I had been training a lot for it … I cried. I’ll admit it. I cried at first. Everybody was saying it will be OK and I know, but this is a cause that is important to me.”</p>
<p>Ms. Mannion thought about running her own relay throughout Pittsburgh when she realized that she could rely on another physical skill she acquired over the years —&nbsp;sewing.</p>
<p>As a former nurse, Ms. Mannion said she has several friends who work in health care and are on the front lines battling the novel coronavirus. Her mother, a Beaver County seamstress, taught her how to sew at a young age, and it suddenly clicked that she could put those skills to good use, and still raise awareness for Down syndrome during the pandemic.</p>
<p>After Ms. Mannion first made masks for her husband, Sean, who works at UPMC Mercy hospital, and her children Maeve, 13, Michael, 9, Maille, 6 and Mia, 2, she began offering them for sale to the public and promised to donate all proceeds to the National Down Syndrome Society.</p>

<p>Over the last month, she has shipped and delivered about 400 masks, including some for Dr. Stacey Lane,&nbsp;founder of the Central Outreach Wellness Center, and her staff while they conducted COVID-19 testing in the Pittsburgh Zoo parking lot.</p>
<p>Ms. Mannion said her and her mother’s masks have been in high demand since the state ordered that businesses still open in the state <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/04/20/pennsylvania-order-wear-mask-businesses-workers-covid-19-pandemic/stories/202004200069?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter_PittsburghPG" target="_blank">must bar anyone without a mask from entering</a>, unless the company is providing medication, medical supplies or food.</p>
<p>“I feel like it’s the least little thing that I can do,” Ms. Mannion said.&nbsp;“I don’t feel like it’s a lot, just making some fabric masks. But everybody has been beyond grateful for it so I figure I can do this and support my cause as well.”</p>
<p>Ms. Mannion has been sewing while homeschooling her oldest three kids during the pandemic, including Maeve who she says was looking forward to meeting her at the finish line in Washington D.C. Since last year’s Run 3.21, Maeve has participated in three of her own runs including the 2019 Pittsburgh marathon and the Great Race.</p>
<p>Ms. Mannion’s involvement with the Down syndrome community began when Maeve was diagnosed while she was pregnant. Before “Facebook days,” Ms. Mannion joined an online Yahoo support group for parents of kids with Down syndrome and still keeps in contact with those families to this day. Once she began selling masks, she got an order from an old support group member who needed masks for her brother-in-law who worked as a police officer in Utah.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Mannion said she was happy to fulfill that order, and is now working to sew 500 masks by request of Achieva, a non-profit Southwestern Pennsylvanian agency that supports children with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She hasn’t put a price on her masks, and is only asking customers to cover the cost of shipping and send a monetary donation of their choice which will go towards her Wold Down Syndrome Day fundraiser.&nbsp;</p>
