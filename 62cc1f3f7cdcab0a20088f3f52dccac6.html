<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 01.27.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi everyone, thanks for stopping in for some pre-Super Bowl chatter. Feel free to chime in with questions on the Steelers, the NFL at large, or whatever else is on your mind today.</p>
<p><strong>schnail</strong>: Why did Vance McDonald become nearly invisible this season? Would someone like Hunter Henry or Eric Ebron have fared much better under the circumstances? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: There's no getting around a disappointing 2019 for McDonald, especially when he was coming off a breakout year for himself in 2018. If his lack of production was because he was playing hurt, then that's not good for a guy who already had a reputation for being injury-prone. If his health wasn't an issue, then that's not a good sign either. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: As for replacing him with a veteran free agent, the market at tight end is shaky. Henry and Ebron have been dynamic players at times, but have dealth with a ton of injuries, and for Ebron, drops are also a concern. Austin Hooper might be the best combination of reliability and experience available, but he'll probably command a big deal if Atlanta doesn't re-sign him.</p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: What have we learned from the playoffs so far, mostly in terms of what FA and drafts the Steelers need to target (positions) to be an elite team next season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't think anything has changed in that regard, Tom. Still need to improve on the offensive line and probably add another difference maker at the skill positions, be it tight end, running back or MAYBE a wide receiver who's so talented that you just can't pass him up. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: But I will say, the way the Chiefs are playing offensively, I find myself wondering if the Steelers defense - or any defense, for that matter - has a prayer of stopping them when Patrick Mahomes is on his game. I guess we'll find out Sunday if the 49ers can figure something out.</p>
<p><strong>RealityMan</strong>: While we have some sizeable holes with the offence, i worry that people are expecting too much from this defence. Last year they were quite strong but were not able to stop the run when needed and did not face many elite quarterbacks. I think we need to leave Vince inas ILB unless its an obvious passing down so we dont get run on. Also put Edmunds up near the line in certain packages as he is better there than covering in space. Lastly, I woukd look to move Hilton or Sutton to the Safety position .Do you see any of these moves happening? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It'll be interesting to see how the inside linebacker spot plays out. To me, that's probably the biggest question mark on defense entering 2020, even more so than whether Terrell Edmunds will take a step forward. Helpful as he was at times, Mark Barron signed a back-loaded contract, so cutting him could free up a lot of cap space. Mike Hilton did play some safety in a couple games this year, and Cameron Sutton's versatility remains his strong suit. The defensive staff has a lot to evaluate this offseason, and I think all those players/positions will be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: I think our best chnace for improving the W/L next year via #49th draft pick would be the best Offensive Lineman avail, at any position. Should be a few there and we are old and slow on the OL. Could help with the run, passing and resiliency. Your educated guess please. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, that would make a lot of sense, although the Steelers - and other teams, for that matter - might be tempted by the sheer volume of talented wideouts in this class. The nice thing about scouting the OL position is that with Matt Feiler establishing himself as a reliable starter, his ability to play guard or tackle opens you up to prospects at both spots. Of course, this all assumes that cutting Ramon Foster is a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph</strong>: Will the Steelers hire a wide receiver coach and a offensive line coach? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I definitely think they'll hire a receivers coach, considering Ray Sherman got thrown into a difficult spot as the interim this past season. But I'd be surprised if they replaced Shaun Sarrett after just one year as the head OL coach. There's also an assistant OL coach under him, former NFL lineman Adrian Klemm.</p>

<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Brian, the Steelers will probably use the franchise tag on Dupree. However, in your opinion, should they designate the exclusive tag or non-exclusive tag? I'm partially leaning towards the non-exclusive tag since the Steelers don't have a 1st round pick. And it would be interesting to see if another team would part with two 1st round picks. Would love to get your thoughts. Thanks! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hey, Nate. Not too many teams use the non-exclusive version. To me, the Steelers have made him such a priority for their defense in 2020 that they wouldn't want to worry about messing around with other teams negotiating. Just tag him the usual way and move on.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: so once sources say we have hardly any money before hitting the cap, another source said we have 20M. do you know the real number? Thanks for chats <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: According to overthecap.com, which I've found to be the most reputable site for this sort of thing, the Steelers sit at just $1.4 million of projected cap space right now. Those saying it will be much higher are probably already factoring in potential moves to create room (cuts, restructures, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>CJ</strong>: Hey Brian, congrats on the addition to your family. Ok, I know that "changing position" questions go over like a lead balloon here, but don't you think that Edmunds could be converted to middle linebacker to play next to Bush? The strongest part of his game is speed and run support. Would hide his poor coverage.... Mark Barron made the conversion earlier in his career, why not Edmunds? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thanks, CJ. Mom and "Dermontti" Dawson Batko are doing well. When the Steelers drafted Edmunds, even before I was covering the team, that was my initial thought. A hybrid type guy who can help replace Ryan Shazier in the middle of the defense. Obviously, to this point, that hasn't been the script for his career. Could it still happen? Sure. The big question is whether he has the frame for it.</p>
<p><strong>Kissfan 48</strong>: Brian, who in your opinion should the Steelers bring in to be the veteran backup Qb? Especially if Ben R doesnt look to be healthy to start the season <br> <strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: I was thinking about Alex Smith as a veteran QB they could bring in, presuming he gets healthy, until I looked at his contract...how about Josh McCown? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't think it's a definite that they will sign one. But if they do, I don't think I would touch those two. Alex Smith might never be the same after the catastrophic and career-threatening injury that has kept him out for so long. And McCown had to be lured out of retirement just this past season to play for Philly. Although it would be funny to add another NFL team to his journeyman career. Blake Bortles strikes me as a guy whose time in the league might be winding down and could be willing to go somewhere on the cheap. Problem is, anyone you'd sign might come into a situation where he's actually the No. 3, behind Mason Rudolph, too.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Your paper seems divided on how far the Steelers are from contention with a "healthy" Ben. Where do you stand if Ben comes back and is close to himself? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well, we aren't just one big hivemind of opinions. We do have our own thoughts on things. If Ben comes back and is close to his 2018 form, I don't think they're far off at all.</p>
<p><strong>SOMD Panther</strong>: Favorite Kobe Bryant moment? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I was talking about this with some friends last night. The 60 points in his final game was epic, but I can't lie, I fell asleep on my couch that night. To me, it's the 81-point game. Did I happen to be watching Lakers-Raptors that night? No, but that's one of those things where I'll always remember where I was the NEXT day, when EVERYONE was talking about it. I had a basketball game at Penn Hills. Don't remember if we won or lost, but I remember what Kobe did the previous night. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: OK everyone, that's all the time we have for today. If you have any questions for a Steelers mailbag, maybe we can get that going again this week. Feel free to tweet me, email me at bbatko@post-gazette.com or even comment at the bottom. Have a good one.</p>
