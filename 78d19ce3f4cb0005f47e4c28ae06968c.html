<h1>Pitt basketball lands transfer guard Nike Sibande</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It's rare for a college basketball program to add a player in June, only a handful of months before the start of the next season, but Pitt just did it.</p>
<p>Nike Sibande, a transfer from Miami (Ohio), has signed an aid agreement with the Panthers and will join them for the 2020-21 season, the program announced Saturday.</p>
<p>As a junior last season, Sibande, a 6-foot-4 guard, averaged 13.9 points and 5.9 rebounds per game. Over his three-year career with the RedHawks, Sibande averaged 15.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game while shooting 41.4% from the field and 33.6% from 3-point range.</p>
<p>An Indianapolis native, Sibande earned third-team all-Mid-American Conference as a sophomore after averaging 16.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game.</p>
<p>In May, Sibande narrowed his college choices to a list of five that did not include Pitt -- he was considering Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Georgetown and Xavier -- making his commitment to Pitt something of a surprise, even beyond the timing of it.</p>
<p>Sibande is not immediately eligible as a traditional transfer and would need a waiver to compete next season, an avenue Pitt's coaching staff may very well pursue. Should he be eligible, he would bolster a pool of guards that is relatively thin beyond Xavier Johnson and Delaware transfer Ithiel Horton.</p>
<p>With the addition of Sibande, coach Jeff Capel and the Panthers have no more available scholarships for next season.</p>
<p>“Nike is an experienced, skilled and productive player who will fit in well with the culture we are building here at Pitt,” Capel said in a statement. "He is an outstanding athlete who loves to compete and has a scorers’ mentality. We look forward to having him in the program and working with him as he continues to develop on and off the court.”</p>
