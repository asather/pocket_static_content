<p><strong>This is a developing story. It will be updated.</strong></p>
<p>Pitt’s vaunted defense has lost another starter.</p>
<p>Senior cornerback Damarri Mathis will miss the 2020 season “due to a non-football related injury,” the program announced Tuesday afternoon. Mathis, a 10-game starter last year, was expected to lead a thin cornerback group alongside Jason Pinnock in 2020.</p>
<p>“We are certainly disappointed for Damarri,” Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi said in a statement. “Fortunately, he still has a redshirt season available in addition to the eligibility relief the NCAA will provide this year.”</p>
<p>Mathis, who has played in 36 games over the last three years, logged two interceptions and 11 pass breakups in 2019, splitting time with Pinnock opposite Dane Jackson.</p>
<p>Now, redshirt sophomore Marquis Williams — who was projected to be Pitt’s No. 3 corner — is in a prime position to step in for Mathis. Narduzzi also praised sophomore A.J. Woods, who played 10 games on special teams as a freshman and has impressed during training camp.</p>
<p>In addition, the Panthers have current freshmen Jahvante Royal and Rashad Battle as depth options. Both were four-star prospects, per Rivals.</p>
<p>The Mathis news comes two weeks after returning All-ACC defensive tackle Jaylen Twyman opted out of the 2020 season. The Pitt defense — which lost starting defensive linemen Rashad Weaver and Keyshon Camp last August for the 2019 season — is forced to replace a pair of first-teamers in consecutive campaigns.</p>
