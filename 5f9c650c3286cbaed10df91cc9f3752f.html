<h1>Josh Bell and Ke'Bryan Hayes flash talents in Kansas City, but Pirates come up short</h1>

<p>KANSAS CITY — Josh Bell hit an absolute bomb. Ke’Bryan Hayes continued to shine. But the Pirates lost to the Royals, 4-3, on Friday at Kauffman Stadium because they made things a little too easy for Kansas City.</p>
<p>Pirates pitchers have improved this season, cutting their ERA from 5.18 to 4.88 entering Friday’s game, but their bigger issue has been walks, specifically with the starters.</p>
<p>A year after averaging 3.10 walks per nine innings (13th-highest in Major League Baseball), Pirates starting pitchers came into this one averaging 4.23 walks per nine, third-worst in baseball.</p>
<p>Steven Brault had trouble commanding his stuff Friday and needed 97 pitches to get through four innings, generating a pitching line we’ve seen too much this season.</p>
<p>Brault allowed five hits, three earned runs, three walks and allowed a run to score on a wild pitch. The Royals (18-28) chewed through Brault’s pitch count by being patient and attacking mistakes, the same as so many teams have done against the Pirates (14-28) this season.</p>
<p>“We have to be more efficient,” manager Derek Shelton said. “We have to attack the zone better. Too many three-ball counts. Honestly, we would love for our starting pitchers to be able to throw six, seven innings and continue to pound the zone and go. I think that would be ideal. We have to be in a situation where we command the zone, throw strikes and get outs and get quicker outs. “</p>
<p>It also hasn’t helped that Brault himself has been inconsistent. Battling a mechanical issue from time to time, where his front side flies open early, Brault’s results have been kind of a mixed bag.</p>
<p>The perfect three innings in Chicago. Zeroes in five of his first seven outings, but four earned runs allowed in each of the other two. Walks have been an especially large issue for Brault, who has issued 17 in 26⅔ innings.</p>
<p>Team-wise, the results are hard to avoid.</p>
<p>Even though they’ve had guys working back from injury and Shelton has had a relatively quick hook, their starting pitchers have completed six innings just four times this season, fewest in the majors. They have just two quality starts, which is also last.</p>
<p>And when your offense is struggling to produce, it makes for a bad recipe.</p>
<p>“Fastball command wasn’t where I wanted early in the game,” Brault said. “It got better as the game went on. Offspeed was pretty solid. They did a really good job of fouling balls off, staying in counts and taking some good pitches. But I have to get ahead of hitters more.”</p>
<p>On Friday, it was a shame, because Bell’s towering home run should’ve put the Pirates ahead. After Royals reliever Scott Barlow hit Bryan Reynolds to lead off the eighth, Bell pounced on a 1-1 fastball that was up and in.</p>
<p>Swinging from the left side, Bell turned on it, crushing it 426 feet with an exit velocity of 109 mph for his fifth of the season and first since Aug. 30.</p>
<p>“I feel like [last] series I was missing that a little bit,” Bell said. “I want to say there were two or three opportunities for me to drive a ball up and in, and I either chopped it up the middle or grounded to second base, so it was good to be on time and be able to turn on it.”</p>
<p>The trouble for Brault started in the bottom of the first, when Royals shortstop Adalberto Mondesi drove a low-and-inside slider out to left for a solo home run.</p>
<p>It continued in the third after Brault walked Mondesi and allowed a single to catcher Salvador Perez, putting runners on the corners with one out. Third baseman Maikel Franco made it a 2-0 game with his bloop single.</p>
<p>After first baseman Hunter Dozier singled to load the bases, Brault spiked a fastball, the wild pitch giving Kansas City a 3-0 lead.</p>
<p>Aside from Bell, the second biggest takeaway for the Pirates featured Hayes, who had a memorable night.</p>
<p>The game opened with Hayes barehanding a bunt attempt to throw out Royals right fielder Whit Merrifield. Hayes picked up two more hits and stole his first base at this level.</p>
<p>“I think he thought he was going to take advantage of a young kid who was a step behind the bag,” Shelton said of Merrifield. “And to make that barehanded play, you don’t see too many guys make that play.”</p>
<p>Or do what Hayes has done thus far in his major league career, when he’s hardly looked out of place, even in a game where he was bumped up to the No. 3 spot.</p>
<p>Hayes likened COVID-19 ball to a spring training atmosphere, since there aren’t any fans, but overall he’s hardly in everything-is-a-blur mode. Young Hayes looks like a regular, like he absolutely belongs.</p>
<p>“After the first few games, just playing a nine-inning game, the game has definitely slowed down even more for me,” Hayes said. “I’m just feeling better and better with that.”</p>
<p>The rookie even had a couple veterans talking, as Bell relayed an exchange with Merrifield later in the game, when the Royals star reached first base.</p>
<p>Merrifield couldn’t believe that Hayes made the play. Neither could Bell. They both sort of shook their heads in amazement, and Bell mentioned Hayes winning three consecutive Gold Gloves in the minor leagues, the two ultimately agreeing that he’s something special.</p>
<p>“The kid’s spectacular, and he’s showing it,” Bell said. “He’s a lot of fun to watch. It’s definitely a show when he’s on the field.”</p>
