<h1>Pretty cats strut their stuff at the Steel City Kitties show</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The unusual-looking chocolate-colored cat preened and stretched, happy to be admired and petted by strangers. Owner Beth Deal of Hampton, Va., patiently explained that though he is spotted like a wild cat, the grand champion she calls Swamp Fox is a very domestic breed known as an ocicat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 14-pound male Swamp Fox was there with equally friendly young female ocicats named Bikini (full name Yellow Polka Dot Bikini) and Annie (Queen Anne’s Revenge.)</p>
<p>There were 180 cats at the Steel City Kitties, Inc.&nbsp; Annual Allbreed Cat Show on Saturday, representing most of the 45 breeds recognized by the Cat Fancier Association. Many are so unusual that spectators spent a lot of time asking,&nbsp;“what is it?”</p>
<p>Answers included ocicat, Bengal, Cornish rex, korat and Somaili — which is a long-haired version of an Abyssinian. Many of the show cats were more recognizable to the cat-loving public, including Persian, Maine coon and Siamese.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Sunday, more than 160 cats will return for the second day of Showing at The Willows Event Center in Industry, Beaver County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the cats competing for ribbons are household pets that don’t have pedigree papers. That included Felix, a blind, 18-month-old long-haired black cat, who was picked up “by the side of the road,” said Suzanne LeFebvre of South Beaver.</p>
<p>“This is his first show” and he was having a great time “because he loves people,” said Ms. LeFebvre, a kindergarten teacher who takes her cat to therapy visits at the Beaver Valley Nursing Home.</p>
<p>In his first two forays into the show ring, one judge gave Felix a ninth-place rosette and another gave him a third-place rosette.</p>
<p>When not in the show ring, Felix, Swamp Fox and a 24-pound Maine coon named Coopurr were available in their rest areas as “pet me” cats.</p>
<p>“The reason I came here is because I wanted to see a Maine coon in real life,” said Sue Frommell of Midland. Coopurr, with Alice Schepp of South Fayette, did not disappoint, posing for the camera phones of Ms. Frommell and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coopurr, retired from the show ring, is a full-time pet who makes regular therapy visits to nursing homes with Mrs. Schepp.</p>
<p>Owners of cats with long coats cannot make their cats available for petting, because sticky fingers and dirty hands can undo the four hours of bathing, blow-drying and brushing that precedes entry into the show ring.</p>
<p>Cat breeders and judges call the competition area&nbsp;“the show ring,” but the feet of the cats never touch the floor. Unlike dog shows, where leashed dogs are trotted and run around the ring, show cats are carried from their rest area to cages where they wait for the judge to pick them up and place them on a judging table.</p>
<p>Frannie, 4, and Heisenberg, 3, were not looking for ribbons at the show. Volunteers Ellen Butcher of Monaca and Roni Lawton brought them from the Beaver County Humane Society, hoping to attract adopters who will give them what rescue people call&nbsp;“furever homes.”</p>
