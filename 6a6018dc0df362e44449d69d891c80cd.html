<h1>Penn State says it has issued dozens of suspensions or housing removals for violating COVID-19 rules</h1>

<p>Penn State University officials, who Friday reported a 26% jump in total COVID-19 cases from the previous week, have sent about two dozen students packing this fall for flouting policies to curb the virus.</p>
<p>Ten students were suspended from the university, meaning they can not register, attend class or live on campus for the rest of the academic year. Seventeen others were removed from university housing, while 204 are on probation, according to statistics released by Penn State this week.</p>

<p>In all, 1,277 sanctions have been logged over the last six weeks, though most&nbsp;— 1,046&nbsp;— were warnings. Violations include refusing to wear a mask or face covering in public, failing to comply with quarantine or isolation guidelines or with guidance on gathering sizes both on- and off-campus.</p>
<p>Despite the tally, Penn State said in a statement that most students are obeying the new policies and restrictions.</p>
<p>"We are grateful for the seriousness with which most of our students take the virus’ threat, but we will continue to hold accountable those students who threaten our community by violating our clearly stated expectations,” said Damon Sims, vice president for student affairs.</p>
<p>The residence removals most commonly involved failure to comply with no-guest rules or guidance about gathering size.</p>
<p>"These students have been given appropriate time to make new arrangements and move out of University housing. They will be refunded a pro-rated portion of unused housing fees, but will be prohibited from living on campus for the remainder of the 2020-21 academic year," the university statement read.</p>
<p>An update Friday to Penn State's COVID-19 dashboard put total infections since August at 2,681, up from 2,124, an increase of 557 the last seven days.</p>
<p>The 640 active cases include new positive results this week and others for which test results from a previous reporting period had been pending. Some 2,040 of the total are no longer active.</p>
<p>Officials have pointed to very low hospitalization rates, available isolation and quarantine space and scant indication of transmission from students to employees as reassuring indicators.</p>
<p>The University Park campus enrolls nearly 50,000 students. Several other Penn State locations have seen cases, too, including Altoona. As of Friday, it reported 126 cases, 42 of them active.</p>
