<p>TEL AVIV — The Israeli army said it struck Hamas military targets in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday morning in response to 13 rockets that were fired out of the territory.</p>
<p>“Approximately 10 terror targets were struck, among the sites struck were a weapons and explosives manufacturing factory and a military compound used for training and rocket launching experiments by the Hamas terror organization,” the army said in a statement.</p>
<p>Israel’s aerial defense systems intercepted eight of the rockets fired from Gaza, the army said.</p>
<p>Palestinians in Gaza began firing rockets over the border on Wednesday night, at the same time as a ceremony was being held in Washington for the signing of normalization agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.</p>
<p>The Magen David Adom emergency service said paramedics treated and evacuated two people who had been injured around the Israeli city of Ashdod, one in a moderate and another in a mild condition. Both were injured by shrapnel.</p>
<p>No group claimed responsibility for firing the rockets, but local observers said the rockets were fired in protest at the normalization agreements.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Palestinians protested in cities in the West Bank and in Gaza against the normalization agreements.</p>
<p>Demonstrators raised Palestinian flags and signs reading: “No to normalization with the occupation.” It has been dubbed the “Day of Popular Rejection.”</p>
<p>Ismail Radwan, the leader of the radical Islamic Hamas movement that rules Gaza, said during a demonstration that Sept. 15 is a “black day in the history of the rulers of the Emirates and Bahrain because of the signing of the disgraceful agreement with the occupation state under U.S. auspices.”</p>
