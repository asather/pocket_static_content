<h1>Obituary: Fred Lucas was championship track coach at Schenley High</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>To so many people, he was simply “Luc.” But Fred Lucas was really cool hand Luc.</p>
<p>“You knew that something really bad had happened if Luc had to take a serious tone with you,” said Mark Lazur, who coached track and field with Lucas for many years at old Schenley High School. “He was one of the most easygoing guys who could find humor in everything.”</p>
<p>But when it came to track and field, whether as a coach or runner, Lucas was seriously good.</p>
<p>Lucas was a longtime, highly respected boys track coach who won City League championships at Schenley and was a physical education teacher for three decades at the now-closed school in Oakland. Lucas was also a pretty good runner himself in his younger days, earning induction to the Slippery Rock University Athletic Hall of Fame in 2013.</p>
<p>Lucas died of cancer Saturday at his home in Highland Park. He was 76.</p>
<p>“Luc was a true gentleman and was the best ambassador that Schenley High School and (Pittsburgh) City League track and field ever had,” said Lazur, retired coach of Schenley’s girls track team. “Any invitational that we ever went to, everybody knew Luc.”</p>
<p>Lucas spent almost half of his life teaching in Pittsburgh Public Schools and coaching track in the City League (he also was an assistant football coach at Schenley). This from someone who grew up in rural Portersville, Butler County. Lucas then attended Slippery Rock University.</p>
<p>“We used to spend every summer together on a family farm in Portersville,” said Christine Glover, a cousin who lived with Lucas for the past 15 years. “One of our other cousins told me that the reason Fred got so into running was because all of his cousins used to beat him in family races. That motivated him. So he got into track, just so he could beat all of those cousins in races.”</p>
<p>At Slippery Rock, he used to beat top-level runners. He earned All-American status in 1963 when he finished 14th at the NCAA Division II cross-country championships. He was 18th in 1962.</p>
<p>Lucas also won two Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference individual championships and set a course record while winning both titles.</p>
<p>After college, Lucas got a teaching job at Herron Hill Junior High School in Pittsburgh before moving on to Schenley a few years later. Lucas became close with George Riley, who also was a Schenley physical education teacher and then became an assistant track coach under Lucas.</p>
<p>“We were like brothers. I was from North Carolina and were both the only child in our families,” Riley said.</p>
<p>Schenley didn’t have a track, so the boys and girls teams often practiced at nearby Carnegie Mellon University. Part of the Lucas and Riley practice regimen was having the track athletes run from Schenley after school to practice at CMU.</p>
<p>“He was a mild-mannered man,” Riley said of Lucas. “He worked the guys to the point where they knew what he was trying to do with them. He didn’t have to yell.”</p>
<p>Lazur said, “The kids loved him.”</p>
<p>One of Lucas’ big moments as a coach came when he won his first City League title in 1995. The victory broke Peabody’s string of 24 consecutive City titles.</p>
<p>“I remember beating Peabody was like winning the Super Bowl for Luc,” Lazur said. “You have no idea how happy all of us were for him because track was really, really important to him and Peabody was so formidable.”</p>
<p>After Lucas retired from coaching, he still served as a volunteer assistant coach for a while. In 2002, the Tri-State Track Coaches Association presented Lucas with its Lifetime Achievement Award for his year of service and commitment.</p>
<p>“I just hear so many stories and see so many comments about how he affected so many kids’ lives,” Glover said.</p>
<p>Lucas is survived by many cousins. His funeral is private due to current health concerns, and a memorial service will be held for him in the future.</p>
