<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 03.11.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi folks. Welcome to my weekly chat. Leave your questions here, and I'll be back at noon to answer them. Thanks so much, as always, for participating!</p>
<p><strong>Sammy</strong>: What is Vazquez's official status at the moment? He finished season on Administrative Leave and still being paid, but that's only temporary. He isn't on the roster at the moment, but my guess is that's due to the Restricted List status that came along with the placement on leave. He hasn't been convicted of a crime yet. <br> <strong>Sammy</strong>: Basically...do the Pirates still have to pay him at the moment, or is MLB going to step in and suspend him before the season starts? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: He is on the restricted list, Sammy. Which means that, no, he does not get paid while on it. I believe they can keep him on the list for as long as they wait, and he would not get paid.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong>: Hi Jason. Live here in VA about 4.5 hours from PNC Park. Want to come up for a series this summer. You have seen a lot from the teams already this spring. What opponent would you pick that is on the schedule? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: If you're in VA, why not come see the defending World Series champs, the Washington Nationals? Failing that, I would recommend any of the visiting teams ... or really just anything. Do we really need a special reason to see PNC Park?</p>
<p><strong>Harry Bacz</strong>: With all the home runs flying out of the ball parks, why do you think that the Pirates hit so few as an organization? Bad drafts? bad mechanics? bad coaching? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Home runs cost money, Harry. Not trying to take a shot at the Pirates here, but if the Pirates had a roster full of big boppers, chances are they couldn't or wouldn't be able to pay all those guys. I think the goal here is to grow the payroll, but right now it isn't in a place where they can have a bunch of those guys. As a small-market team, the Pirates should be looking at different areas of the game to be good at, IMO.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Jason, Do you think the dismal exhibition record is good indicator of how lacking in talent they are at this point and will be how the season plays out? Thank you. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Jack. I'm not taking their spring training record as any indicator that they're going to stink. I think overall one of the things you can (fairly criticize) the Pirates for is a lack of depth. I think spring training exposes that more than anything, as starters typically only play about half the games. We know they need to acquire more talent. What they do have is good enough to flirt with .500, in my opinion. I also don't think spring training results are a true predictor of regular season success. That said, they do need to pitch and hit better than they have once the regular season starts.</p>
<p><strong>Dingo</strong>: Who is to blame for the two dudes getting thrown out at home? Was it a player mistake or Joey Cora? And why did the pirates retain Cora, it seems if the rest of the previous regime is gone. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know if there's anyone to blame, honestly. It was just a weird play. If Kevin Kramer doesn't fall doesn't fall down, we're not having this conversation. Are you gonna tell him to stay on his feet? Chances are he knows he needs to do that. Derek Shelton has also said they're gonna be aggressive and try some things in spring. My guess is this was one of those times. As for Cora, I agree he's probably over-aggressive, but I also would rather my third-base coach be too aggressive than not aggressive enough.</p>
<p><strong>Wes Mantooth</strong>: Who do you see going at the deadline? Will the rebuild be more apparent once the season progresses? I don’t see the point in taking playing time away from tucker... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I could see Chris Archer, Keone Kela and Adam Frazier being deadline possibilities. I hope they don't trade Bell; I think they should still be trying to sign him long-term. But if the three I mentioned have good first halves, then I think it could make good business sense to move them. I'd like to see Tucker -- similar to Ke'Bryan Hayes -- go to Triple-A and force the big club to make a move because he's absolutely crushing the ball. We're not there yet with him.</p>
<p><strong>Sammy</strong>: The placement on the Restricted List came with the Administrative Leave designation, so I wasn't sure if that was suspended was leave was done. "A Player placed on Administrative Leave shall be placed on the Major League Restricted List for purposes of the Club’s Reserve List limits." <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yeah, the restricted list can be indefinite.</p>
<p><strong>Dingo</strong>: How has Colin Moran looked this spring? I have always thought he capable of big things - but haven’t see it yet. Has he already reached his maximum potential ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think so, Dingo. He has been up and down. I can't say I've seen a drastic change in his defense, which is a little disappointing. He has shown some decent pop, which could put the Pirates in a bit of a strange situation. Do they live with his fielding to get the bat? What is Hayes doing? So far Hayes has hit well. If he shows he can do that at the major league level, that will likely be his ticket to getting a regular major league job. But there's been nothing Earth-shattering thus far with Moran.</p>
<p><strong>Wes Mantooth</strong>: Also; why are other teams tv deals publicized but the Pirates remain secretive? The lack of transparency this organization shows is astounding <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: In the Pirates' defense, it's not the norm to publicize your TV deal. I know some are out there, but there's also a large chunk that is not. The conspiracy theorist in me says they wanna keep it quiet because it would basically be setting a benchmark for the fan base. "You're making xxx in TV money, why aren't you spending more?!" That sorta thing.</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: Other than the aforementioned play, how have the fundamentals been so far this spring? The lack thereof was a major sore spot for me last year. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They have been better, absolutely. Something to consider here is how seemingly checked out they were on the whole last season. I don't know if that's an indictment of the players, Hurdle and Co., both or just a relationship running its course, but it certainly seems like that stuff has improved. And I agree with you: It absolutely needs to be better.</p>
<p><strong>William</strong>: right now, is Jason Martin a better baseball player than Jarod Dyson? And if so, shouldn’t they roll with the young guy to see what they have? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think so. Dyson has proven himself in this league. He's won a World Series. His personality has value. Nothing against Jason Martin, but what has he done at this level? Maybe if Dyson has a hot start and somebody wants him, it makes sense to skew younger. But right now, for $2 million, I have absolutely no problem playing Dyson as my regular CF.</p>
<p><strong>Dingo</strong>: Do see the pirates employing the “opener” (starting a reliever) strategy again this year? It seems like a good concept and seemed to work for the rays last year but not the bucs. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know if I see that happening. I think it worked/works for the Rays because of personnel. The Pirates doing it with Michael Feliz, as they did last year, that's just not the same thing. Also, I would think with Holland, Brault and Kuhl, they should have at least a little more rotation depth than they did in 2019. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Jose Osuna 2019 vs. RHP: .284 BA/.849 OPS<br> Osuna 2019 vs. LHP: .228/.613<br> Osuna career vs. RHP: .247/.724</p>
<p><strong>William</strong>: Do the pirates have the magical powers to combine Moran, who crushes righties, and Osuna, who crushes lefties, into one player? Cause I think they’d have something there <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Osuna career vs. LHP: .244/.713<br> *** I'm not sure I would say that Osuna crushes lefties. Or that he hits them significantly better than he does righties. It may be the other way around. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Moran has a .767 career OPS vs. righties compared to .630 vs. lefties, but those numbers did improve at least a little during the second half of last season.</p>
<p><strong>PhillyJake</strong>: With such a low payroll this year, why don't they extend Bell with a heavy front loaded contract? Just to have some fun with it, let's say they give him $40m this year, the next six years at $10m. Payroll this year still below $100m, and he's locked up for 7 years at a manageable amount with which they can afford to sign other free agents! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I really don't think the Pirates are going to sign Josh Bell to a contract that would make him baseball's highest-paid player. I mean, I wanted them to sign Bell and spend more money, but that's a pretty big ask. That said, I get what you're saying: front load the contract and buy out some arb/free agency years. I would definitely like to see them try, but I also think he might (reasonably) say, "Nah, you know what? I'm this close. I think I'm gonna try free agency."</p>
<p><strong>Wayward</strong>: Any scenario at this point where Gonzalez doesn't make the team. He seems to have been just "meh" to this point. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: If they warm to the idea of keeping three catchers, perhaps. John Ryan Murphy has been decent this spring, and they could value his bat off the bench. I doubt it, but I think that would be the scenario. They seem to like Gonzalez, for his versatility, defense and ability to hit lefties.</p>
<p><strong>PhillyJake</strong>: Amy chance we see Taillon in the bullpen as the season wanes? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Unless he walks down there to see a couple buddies, none. Just not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Randy</strong>: Any insight to how much all the pre-arb players settled for yet, or is that not something you look into? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It's not something I spend a ton of time worrying about, to be honest. They also make a little more than the major league minimum. It's really a formality. Doesn't change things either way, as they're under club control.</p>
<p><strong>Sammy</strong>: Any chance that Kuhl opens on the IL, kind of like Lyles last year, just to continue catching up? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Umm ... I don't know about on the IL but maybe in the IL. Kuhl threw a two-inning sim game the other day. That's not terribly far behind the others. He could be game ready by the start of the season, even if it's for a bullpen role. He could also open the season with Class AAA Indianapolis, as I believe he has at least one option left.</p>
<p><strong>Winchester</strong>: The bullpen believe it or not looks to be impressive. Kela, Crick, Burdi, Santana, and RRod. But will the absence of a reliable lefty be an issue? Doesn’t look like any of the lefty’s they brought to camp are working. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I agree with you on both counts. Howard, Erlin and Jerez have all been terrible. Brault's injury puts Holland in the rotation, and robs them of a lefty in the 'pen. That said, Richard Rodriguez has reverse splits, and I do think their bullpen could be halfway decent. Would be great, though, if one lefty stepped up and did something. Nik Turley has looked good thus far. Probably a long shot, but he's been the best of the bunch.</p>
<p><strong>thomastown</strong>: I believe the Pirates lease for PNC expires in 10 years. My concern is that the owner (I refuse to say his name) will continue to milk the team until then. At that point, he will look for a big payday by reaching a sweetheart deal with another city to move the team. Or perhaps, he will sell to someone who will overpay and who will then move the team. Of course, he will blame this on low attendance and lack of support.<br> I would like to get your thoughts on how credible this scenario is and if so, what could be done to head this off. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think Bob Nutting will do that. Many will disagree, and plenty others probably want him to sell, but I do think he wants to continue to own the Pirates, in Pittsburgh, maybe to his detriment. Selling a major league baseball team could net a ton of cash. He could walk away right now and do extremely well for himself. I think he stays because he likes it and wants to continuing doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: who is leading the race for the back up catcher position? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think it's Luke Maile's job to lose. The offense is OK at best right now, but if he can hit just enough, he's been much better defensively than John Ryan Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Jason, who do you see as the position players who make the team as bench players this year, and who are the odd men out? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: My bench right now would look like this: Guillermo Heredia, Luke Maile, JT Riddle, Jose Osuna and Erik Gonzalez. I wouldn't want to have Cole Tucker up here to sit, the same for Ke'Bryan Hayes. I'd maybe think about giving Phillip Evans a chance or moving Colin Moran to a bench role if Hayes hits his way into the big leagues.</p>
<p><strong>Dingo</strong>: Do you think being in the home run derby last year “messed” with Josh Bell’s swing? I remember he started the second half very slow. Do you think he would participate in the derby again in 2020 given the oppurtunity. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know if it was the Home Run Derby, but something did. I talked to Bell about this at the start of spring training, and he never found his timing in the second half. I also don't know if there's a magic bullet here, other than he simply never got comfortable. I know it's a convenient theory to blame the Derby, but I do think it was more than that.</p>
<p><strong>Winchester</strong>: If the pirates do extend Hayes this spring, does that guarantee he’s the opening day third basemen? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It depends. It could, provided he continues to hit. Or maybe they structure the deal so it kicks in next season. My guts tells me, yes, if they do that, it would make him your opening day third baseman, although I can't say that with great authority.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: Pirates finish with the worst record in Baseball history ? Correct ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't agree with that. I think they're going to be a decent amount better than they were last season, which I've said in this space for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>PhillyJake</strong>: Why kind of limitations is Chad Kuhl on, coming off of TJ surgery? Santana? I realize they differ as one is a starter, the other a reliever. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Santana, none. And he's been tremendous this spring. He'll have a regular bullpen role out of spring training. I'd look at him to pitch the seventh with a lead, bridging the gap to Crick and Kela. Kuhl has built up to a two-inning sim game the other day. He's a little behind other pitchers. I don't think that's overly concerning, but coming out of spring with a job in the starting rotation? That's probably a little much to expect at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Winchester</strong>: In your honest opinion, what is the short term and long term outcome for Cole Tucker? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Short-term I think he goes to Indy. He needs to play and hit. He needs to strike out less and hit for more power. I think he can do both things. His defense plays at the major league level, but there's work to be done with the bat. Long-term, assuming those things happen, I think he's probably one of your middle infielders of the future.</p>
<p><strong>Winchester</strong>: Do u see the pirates being aggressive with Cruz in the minors? If he performs well, any chance we see him in September? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't. I think he's tremendously talented, but I think he's at least a year away. Maybe by September, because of his ability, but I think the Pirates should be worried about doing this right as opposed to trying to fast-play his development. I also don't know if I see him sticking at short.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Good afternoon! I enjoyed your article on Tyler Glasnow. It was apparent we needed a change in philosophy when it comes to pitching. I assume Marin has been working on mechanics with our guys. I've heard Keller has looked pretty good so far this spring. Has Marin provided any changes to Keller's delivery? Or is it due to Keller getting experience at the big league level? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Marin has not changing anything substantive with Keller's delivery, other than refining things. Keller has looked quite good this spring, I agree. But I think a lot of that has to do with his own maturity more than anything. As for Glasnow and that whole mess, I had known this for quite some time. It's one of the reasons I feel like they'll be better, though I couldn't mention it because it was told to me off-the-record by a former Pirates pitcher. The former regime did a lot of good things, but they just never evolved beyond pitching in and pounding sinkers.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: When will someone the local government or local media have the guts to drag or called for him to be dragged Bob Nutting in from of a State committee or City Council and demand he open his books or face criminal charges ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I probably wouldn't hold your breath. I broached this issue with Bill Peduto back in October, in an interview that was actually scheduled before the first article about the Pirates and local politicians came out. I would encourage you to read it: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/10/17/bill-peduto-pittsburgh-pirates-ownership-bob-nutting-pnc-park/stories/201910170157" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/10/17/bill-peduto-pit...</a></p>
<p><strong>Winchester</strong>: I agree the previous regime deserved a lot of blame for Glas/Cole/Morton development. But Cole and Morton at least had some success and started playoff games here. Is it a bad look by Glasnow to burry the pirates on his way out and then again this week when it was rare for him to make it out of the first inning here? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think so. I also don't think Glasnow was "burying" the Pirates as much as he was answering questions about his time here. As I just typed, he's not the first Pirates pitcher -- current or former -- to feel this way. He's just the first one to say it publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Sammy</strong>: Your rankings on players to most likely be extended before the season starts? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Winchester</strong>: You mentioned Cruz not sticking at short, so is first base an option? I know pirates have struggled defensively transitioning guys to first (Pedro, Jaso, Bell) But could Cruz, coming from a challenging defensive position like SS be a good first basemen? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think he could. I would also like to see what he could do in the outfield. And I'm not saying he CAN'T play short. I'm just saying that I have some doubts whether that will ultimately be his long-term home. I should have been more clear with that.</p>
<p><strong>PhillyJake</strong>: How's Brault's bat looking ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Ha. I have not seen it. Maybe I should've mentioned him as a bad off the bench. ... Seriously, though, they've had a DH in games. I've literally not been able to see him take swings, other than through a fence in the batting cages at Pirate City ... which obviously didn't tell me much.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: I think it is unreasonable to assume that Reynolds and Newman have as good a year with the bat as they did last year. Major league pitchers and coaches are just too good to not adapt a different approach to pitching to them. With that said and the fact that their best hitter (Marte) is not there, I don’t see the Pirates scoring enough to overcome any small improvement in the pitching <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Devil's advocate ... if that's so easy, why didn't opposing teams and managers ever adjust last season? Do you think it's a months-long process to pitch to these guys differently? They could just be decent players.</p>
<p><strong>Winchester</strong>: Does the DH coming to the NL make Bell more appealing when it comes to an extension? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think he should be plenty appealing already, personally, but I do think the Pirates would really stand to benefit if the DH came to the National League. They could DH Bell and use Will Craig at first, if he earns it, or even Colin Moran, if he winds up hitting the ball but just can't field it.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: I disagree. Mr Nutting gets tax money for his resorts. He should be required to submit to yearly State audits <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You're perfectly welcome to disagree. As a tax-paying and voting citizen, you're perfectly entitled to (legally) express your opinion and vote for who you want to vote for. I'm just relaying the opinion of the people in charge. The City of Pittsburgh isn't going to put a lean on Bob Nutting just because the Pirates have been bad at baseball. Again, as Peduto said -- and nobody has to agree with it; I'm just relaying the thoughts -- it would be like him taking Giant Eagle to task because he thought they charged too much for groceries.</p>
<p><strong>Winchester</strong>: I’m not gonna name names. But does it get tiresome trying to describe or defend the Pirates to talking radio heads in this town? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Not at all. And you can name names if you want because I have an exclusive contract with the Fan. It's a free country. It's my job to cover the Pirates, which means writing about them, doing these chats and talking on the radio and TV about them. I try to be fair. I also try to respect the opinions of others. The same as beat reporters covering teams, where we're not fans and we get paid the same whether they win or lose, I get paid the same whether they make great moves or idiotic ones. It's my job to write and talk about those in a professional and insightful fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Bird</strong>: I'm normally a Buccos optimist, but I don't see how they flirt with .500 this year. The lost their best starter (Taillon), best reliever (Vasquez) and best all around player (Marte). Even with some internal improvements, I don't see it. They also play in a very strong division. Where do you see the improvement coming from? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think they can and will pitch better than they did last year. (See the Glasnow article). I also think they will defend better than they did last year. They never really had Taillon last year, and not having Vazquez was sort of irrelevant during their late-season slump; they were usually losing so badly that he just sat there. ... If Archer and Keller can pitch better ... If they get the good version of Polanco ... if Burdi and Santana stay healthy and the bullpen emerges of a strength (it was awful last season) ... then I can see them improving.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: On Newman...based on all the supporting stats and metrics, his BA was quite inflated. I wouldn't bet on him producing at that level, no matter how he's pitched. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: That's fine. You're entitled to your opinion. I don't agree with it, but you're certainly entitled to your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Winchester</strong>: Have you noticed any difference with the way fans or media are going about business in spring training with the corona outbreak? Will be in Bradenton next week and am wondering what to expect. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Other than us observing the media guidelines set forth by MLB, no, I have not noticed any differences. Hopefully people are being more cautious and washing their hands more, but I have not conducted any surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: I didn’t say or insinuate that they are not good hitters, but both hit .300 last year and I think you will find it difficult for any rookie to duplicate that. Many call it a sophomore jinx. I just think it’s major league pitchers adapting to them. Ask Josh Bell if he felt he was pitched differently after his rookie year. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I know he was. And they will be, too. And Bell didn't do a good enough job adjusting and countering. He's admitted that. That might also happen to Reynolds or Newman, but I'm not saying it's absolutely gonna happen or anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: I’m just glad Coonelly/Huntington/Stark/Hurdle/Searage gone!!<br> do you see and feel a difference? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Very much so. I think those guys did some great things and certainly deserve praise, but it was absolutely time for a change. Nothing wrong with that, either. Happens in pro sports all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: With media access currently being restricted, is the concern that this is a precursor to something more permanent, or that it feels like a cosmetic solution while allowing everything else to proceed as is? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think there's a concern that pro sports leagues will prefer it this way, but I don't see how that changes. Media access is negotiated into contracts. There's only so much leagues could change if they wanted to. And everything I've heard involves the leagues maintaining they definitely want to go back as soon as it's safe to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Stugotz</strong>: Take your best stab at the NL central standings on Sept 30th <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I haven't researched this as much as I would like to give an answer that's gonna stick out there, then be thrown in my face if it's horribly wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Clueless</strong>: I don't want to seem stupid or anything, but what exactly is a simulated game? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It's like a virtual reality thing with a headset ... nah, I'm just kidding. It's where they basically have a couple guys hit and simulate at-bats, with some version of an umpire, even if it's a coach. They'll shoot for a certain amount of innings or pitches, and it'll be treated as a game ... just between the pitcher and hitter.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I mean, isn't fact/stat based observation more important way to base one's opinion? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Greg, you're telling me that based on the numbers from last year, he's not gonna hit this year. If you apply that same logic to 2018-19, Kevin Newman should've been a terrible major league player in 2019. They're human beings. Past results are not always a predictor of future success.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Bird</strong>: I don't disagree with your logic, but that's a lot of "if"s. In my years of following the Bucs there are usually just as many regressions or negative outcomes as positive ones. Everything going right almost never happens. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: That's fair. And they don't have enough depth right now if those things don't happen. But I do still think this team will fare better than 69 wins.</p>
<p><strong>Stugotz</strong>: If and when Frazier is moved, who is more likely to take 2nd? Tucker or Newman? Have seen Tucker get some work at 2nd this spring <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: That's an interesting one. I see Tucker as the more natural shortstop. My first move would be to move Newman to second; however, there's probably a line of thought -- and I'm not sure it's wrong -- that Newman has earned the right, assuming he continues to produce, to stay where he's at. I'd have no issue if they decided to move Tucker to second base.</p>
<p><strong>David</strong>: Seems like a lot of "ifs" are being thrown around, the hope that the stars will align that will allow them to sniff .500 baseball. Do you have any "stone cold locks" for improvement that you'd like to guarantee for the year? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think the bullpen will be better than it was last year. Shoot, it would be hard for it to be much worse, especially during the second half.</p>
<p><strong>Brendan</strong>: Was Hurdle as miserable/cranky as it seemed last season? Just listening to him before/after games, seemed like he was always on edge. No disrespect towards him, but just seemed like he wasn't enjoying himself whatsoever. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Umm ... that's a tough one, because it was such a frustrating season for them and him. I'm sure he was frustrated, sure. And I would be, too, if I was having to use Montana DuRapau as an opener because they couldn't go get a legitimate starting pitcher or handing the ball to Alex McRae in the later innings. As I said before, I just think it was time, for everyone involved. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. That does it for this week's chat. Thank you so much for participating. Let's do this again next Wednesday.</p>
