<h1>Pirates to celebrate Jackie Robinson Day with charitable initiatives</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Major League Baseball has honored Jackie Robinson Day every April 15 since 2004. Each player wears No. 42 on their jerseys and there are typically small ceremonies or tributes at MLB stadiums across the country to commemorate the anniversary of Robinson’s breaking of baseball’s color barrier on April 15, 1947.</p>
<p>This year, with the COVID-19 pandemic delaying the baseball season, the Pirates are taking special measures to continue the tradition of honoring Robinson.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Pirates announced several charitable initiatives that will take place on Wednesday, which will mark the 73rd anniversary of Robinson’s MLB debut.</p>
<p>It will begin on Wednesday morning, when Pirates Charities will team up with Silver Star Meats to distribute more than 100 boxed lunches to the Neighborhood Resilience Project in Pittsburgh’s Hill District.</p>
<p>Additionally, Pirates Charities has joined forces with Koppers to make a $5,000 contribution to All One Pittsburgh, a fund dedicated to distributing essential household items to underserved communities. In this case, that means distributing things like toilet paper, paper towels, disinfectants and hand sanitizers to help slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Finally, Pirates Charities announced this year’s Most Valuable Diverse Business Partner award will go to Lisa Scales, the president and CEO of the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. The Food Bank has been instrumental in recent days and weeks in helping those in need to obtain food through drive-up food distribution events during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>The Pirates and Pirates Charities have worked with the Graeter Pittsburgh Community Food Bank in recent weeks, as well, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/03/20/Pirates-Greater-Pittsburgh-Food-Bank-Pirates-Charities-donation/stories/202003200082" target="_blank">donating $50,000</a> to the nonprofit in March.</p>
