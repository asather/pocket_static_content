<h1>State System website indicates that early retirement goal reached</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The number of Pennsylvania state university faculty signing up for early retirement under an enhanced sick leave payout program appears to have surpassed the required 200 threshold with several hours to go until Monday’s close-of-business deadline.</p>
<p>A running tally on the State System of Higher Education’s website put the number of signups at 202 as of the end of Friday. An updated tally that included signups received Monday was not immediately available.</p>
<p>State System of Higher Education spokesman David Pidgeon said he had no immediate comment but noted that officials were planning on issuing a statement around the close of business.</p>
<p>The Enhanced Sick Leave Payout Program was announced in January as a way to help bring campus revenues in line with costs across the 14 member universities that have seen enrollment declines of 20% to nearly 96,000 since 2010, but so far have reduced faculty ranks by 5.9%.</p>
<p>As recently as last week, the program was 35 individuals shy of the goal.</p>
<p>The faculty members who take part in the program are to retire by Aug. 14 if it goes forward. Over the past decade, single-year retirements have ranged from 112 to 250, according to system data. Last year, 190 retired.</p>
<p>The program offers a payout for up to 125 accrued sick days instead of the maximum 50 for eligible faculty. Participants could range in age based on years of service, from 10 to 25 years, and five years for those with an approved disability. Those eligible for 125 days would have to have accrued at least 300 sick days over the course of their tenure.</p>
<p>It was approved by the system’s board of governors in January and backed by Chancellor Daniel Greenstein. Officials said the retirements would be irrevocable if the threshold is met, but if it fell short, they could be rescinded.</p>
<p>As recent as a week ago, Mr. Pidgeon expressed concern given that the total stood at 165.</p>
<p>Kenneth Mash, president of the Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties, last week characterized the odds of success at 50-50, saying the offer was lower than others he has seen but could be enough to encourage a professor on the cusp. He noted that it’s typical for people to put off such decisions until the deadline approaches.</p>
<p>The offer grew from a collective bargaining side letter between the system and APSCUF, which represents about 5,000 professors at the 14 universities including California, Clarion, Edinboro, Indiana and Slippery Rock in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
