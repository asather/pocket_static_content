<h1>Youngwood man has ‘shear’ nerve, kind heart to shave off beard for fundraiser</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bruce Sleasman admits he has “this really awesome mustache.” But it’s his flowing white beard that’s getting all the attention.</p>
<p>Mr. Sleasman, a resident of Youngwood in Westmoreland County, will submit to having it sheared Wednesday morning before work as part of his company’s $70,000 fundraiser. This very hairy event streams on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joe.rotolo.90" target="_blank">Facebook</a> Live somewhere around 7 a.m.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to help my fellow associates here,” said Mr. Sleasman, 58. He’s the store manager at the Greensburg Safelite AutoGlass in Hempfield Township. When pondering whether he wanted to remove three years worth of facial hair, he asked one of his bosses “Do you think anyone would pay to see me shave my beard?”</p>
<p>The response was a resounding “yes.” Mr. Sleasman originally wanted to shoot for a $500 goal, which would benefit Safelite’s national Caring Heart Fund. The fund helps out employee families in need, and this year has been especially impactful, given the financial restraints created by the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘I think you can get more than $500.’&nbsp;We wanted to get it to $1,500 and we called it the ‘Brave the Shave’ initiative,” said Jenny Cain, national director of field communications.</p>
<p>Within six hours, they’d raised $10,000 in contributions.</p>
<p>Execs from Safelite, which has its home offices in Columbus, Ohio, joined in. One shaved his head to add to the fund. Another, bald, proposed to wear a wig to Zoom meetings.</p>
<p>There is a field operations manager who will be shaving his head to close out the fundraiser as it tops the $70,000 mark.</p>
<p>“The Caring Heart Fund is something we’ve had around since 2005,” Ms. Cain said. “It is something we extended [this time] for all stores across the country, but it started with Bruce.”</p>
<p>She said that the venture drew inspiration from former Steeler Brett Keisel’s “Fear Da Beard” fundraisers.</p>
<p>Mr. Sleasman’s wife, Kate, will do the honors Wednesday. The event takes place in the Safelite garage, witnessed by his co-workers and whomever is&nbsp;awake and curious to watch on district manager Joe Rotolo’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that she gets the first cut, Mr. Sleasman said.</p>
<p>“This all started with my daughter getting married three years ago… she [Mrs. Sleasman] said, ‘After that, you’ll never have to shave again.’ “</p>
<p>So he didn’t. The beard, white and with a bit of the original red, is about 11 inches long. “She’s going to be so happy to be the one to cut it, but I will be happy too. It’s becoming a bit of a nuisance,” he added.</p>
<p>The mustache, which he’s had for 42 years or roughly since he was old enough to shave, stays. “My wife can’t even see my lips anymore!”</p>
<p>There will be no sorrow, only joy, when the first clips drop to the floor.</p>
<p>“It’ll come back. It’s hair. Maybe it will never be this long again, but I’m ready.”</p>
