<h1>Bloomfield Shursave sold to Echo Realty for $5.78 million</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>About two years after one redevelopment plan fell through, the Bloomfield Shursave IGA on Liberty Avenue&nbsp;has been sold to Echo Realty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>O’Hara-based Echo said that it bought the property along Liberty Avenue under the&nbsp;operating entity of Bloomfield Bridge Associates LLC.</p>
<p>For now, the grocery store is still open. The deal closed in January for a sale price of $5.78 million, according to county records.</p>
<p>“We are excited to add this well-located property to our portfolio of real estate holdings,” Echo CEO Thomas Karet said in a statement.</p>
<p>The news release did not reveal any further plans for the site. A Shursave representative declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Echo Realty is trying to redevelop another site in the city: Shady Hill Center in Shadyside. The real estate firm wants to build about 250 residential units at that site. It also is proposing 492 spaces of parking. The current Shakespeare Giant Eagle, which would close during construction, would lose about 20,000 square feet.</p>
<p>Echo is affiliated with O’Hara-based grocer Giant Eagle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shursave site has been in developers’ crosshairs before. Indianapolis-based Milhaus proposed turning the site into a 200-plus unit apartment complex in 2018, but the plans never materialized.&nbsp;</p>
