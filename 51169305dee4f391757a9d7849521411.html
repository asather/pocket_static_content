<p>A severe thunderstorm, strong winds and heavy rain Thursday evening brought power outages across southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>At around 11 p.m., Duquesne Light announced in a press release that over 40,000 of its customers are currently without power across the region due to the strong storm that swept through the area — bringing in wind gusts of up to 60 mph. A short time earlier, more than 22,000 West Penn Power its&nbsp;customers were reported to have been affected by outages.</p>
<p>For its part,&nbsp;Duquesne Light&nbsp;also states that around 100 crew members are working to restore power “as quickly as possible.” Communities such as Fox Chapel, Moon and Richland appeared to be impacted the hardest, according to the company’s power-outage map. A couple-thousand customers were reported to have been affected in each of those areas, according to the map.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Weather Service in Pittsburgh had issued severe thunderstorm warnings for the Pittsburgh, Bethel Park and Monroeville area until 7:45 p.m. Thursday. It also issued a severe thunderstorm warning in Washington, Pa.; Canonsburg; and Steubenville, Ohio, until 8 p.m.</p>
<p>By 6:40 p.m., multiple wires, trees and poles were down due to the storm, according to Allegheny County’s Twitter account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Duquesne Light spokesperson Ashley Macik said earlier in the night that the company experienced issues with its website and phone lines — which made it difficult for customers to initially report outages.</p>
<p>“Because of these challenges, the full extent of storm damage and the number of impacted customers are not yet known,” Ms. Macik said in a press release. Ms. Macik states as of 10:30 p.m., the outage map on the company’s website is working and customers have been able to report outages through the website or by contacting the DLC Call Center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FirstEnergy Corp. spokesperson Clifford Cole said the company, which owns West Penn Power, is continuing to deal with new storm-related outages throughout the night. At around 10:30 p.m., Mr. Cole reported there was around 17,600 West Penn Power customers without power and about 5,000 customers restored. According to its power-outage map, New Kensington was one of the major areas impacted by the power outages, with 46 outages reported as of 11:38 p.m. Thursday.</p>
<p>“We continue to assess the situation and should have more to share in the morning,” Mr. Cole said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Allegheny County’s Twitter, Pine, Edgeworth, McCandless, Aleppo, Harrison, Richland, Frazer, Marshall and Tarentum were reported to have been impacted with downed wires, trees and poles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tree fell on a house with power out at the 300 block of Pine Road in Edgewood, according to the county’s Twitter account. A transformer also blew on Harts Run Road and Clearview Road, the county said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s Twitter also stated there was flooding at the 1000 block of Roup Avenue in Brackenridge on Thursday night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Macik said Duquesne Light crews will continue to restore power to affected customers throughout the evening and into Friday, but that full restoration may not be complete until Saturday afternoon.</p>
