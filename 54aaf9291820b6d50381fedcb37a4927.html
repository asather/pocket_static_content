<h1>Will the Penguins stick with the hot goalie or the stickhandling one against the Capitals? </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>First of all, stick tap to the Super Genius.</p>
<p>It was Mark Madden, radio host on 105.9 The X, who first made the point that Tristan Jarry’s stickhandling could be an X-factor against a team with a heavy forecheck like, say, the Washington Capitals. In the weeks since, that point has been widely parroted across the sports media landscape in Pittsburgh, repeated so often that it was fair to wonder how big of an impact that nuance of the game really might be.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps there’s no better person to ask than Penguins defenseman Marcus Pettersson. He leads the league in the most painful statistical category — hits taken — with 241 during 5-on-5 play, a whopping 76 more than the next closest skater. Many of those collisions have occurred in the defensive zone, when Pettersson goes back to retrieve the puck with angry forecheckers breathing down his neck.</p>
<p>So, Marcus, does a goalie who can handle the puck as well as Jarry really make a noticeable difference against a heavy forechecking team?</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” Pettersson said. “In a game, it’s 5-on-5. But if you have a goalie that can play the puck, it’s kind of 6-on-5 getting out of your zone. It’s something that for sure helps us. You never want to go back for a puck when you’ve got two guys coming at you.”</p>
<p>Before the Penguins play against similarly skilled puck-handling goalies, they’re cognizant of this fact. Instead of softly rimming the puck into the offensive zone, they make a point slap it cross-ice or softly chip it down the same side so the goaltender can’t get to it.</p>
<p>“When we play a goalie like [Pekka] Rinne or [Ben] Bishop or [Mike] Smith or any one of those guys, we try to keep it away from him as much as possible because it kind of kills your forecheck," Pettersson said. "It kills your momentum.”</p>
<p>Time will tell if Jarry will have a chance to showcase his stickhandling on Saturday afternoon, when the Penguins host the Capitals at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
<p>Matt Murray started both games against the Capitals this year, winning one and losing one. He <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/03/05/Penguins-win-Sabres-Matt-Murray-Patric-Hornqvist-Sidney-Crosby-Bryan-Rust/stories/202003050211" target="_blank">made a strong case</a> for a third-straight start on Thursday night in Buffalo, bailing out the Penguins several times in a second period when the skaters weren’t doing their goaltender too many favors.</p>
<p>Murray has now won back-to-back games to help the Penguins snap their six-game skid. His start on Thursday marked the first time since Feb. 6 that one of the Penguins' two goalies started consecutive games.</p>
<p>“I think Matt’s playing extremely well,” Sullivan said when asked about Murray. “You look at the game last night, the second period we got away from our game a little bit. Give Buffalo credit. They played extremely well. They had a number of quality chances and Matt shut the door.”</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, Sullivan was asked if he feels it’s important to see how a goaltender performs against a possible playoff opponent. The coach chose not to tip his hand.</p>
<p>“It’s important for us to win,” he said. “That’s the way we look at it. We’re just trying to win one game right in front of us.”</p>
<p><strong>Line ‘em up</strong></p>
<p>Dating back to last season, the Penguins experimented with a line combination that featured Nick Bjugstad at center, Jared McCann at left wing and Patrick Hornqvist on the right.</p>
<p>With Bjugstad sidelined since mid-November after core muscle surgery, the Penguins weren’t able to go back to it. Until Thursday. Almost instantly, it had success when Bjugstad barreled Buffalo goaltender Jonas Johansson, leaving Hornqvist to clean up the trash in a mostly vacant net.</p>
<p>“I think there are a lot of elements on that line when you look at those three guys and what they bring to our team,” Sulivan said. “They have the ability to score. They’ve got good size. All three of them are conscientious two-way players.”</p>
<p>Over the last couple months, there were questions about if McCann or Bjugstad should be the third-line center. By playing both together, the Penguins are putting two center-capable players on the ice together, which can have its advantages.</p>
<p>“One is a lefty,” Sullivan said. “One is a righty. So they have the ability to take faceoffs on both sides. I think there’s just a lot of elements on that line that can be a real good line for us.”</p>
<p><strong>ZAR making progress</strong></p>
<p>Zach Aston-Reese once again skated on his own prior to Friday’s practice. He’s continuing to work his way back from a lower body injury he suffered on Feb. 16. At the time, the Penguins said his status would be “week-to-week.”</p>
