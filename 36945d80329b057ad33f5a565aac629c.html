<h1>Steelers discontinue business travel, take other precautions amid COVID-19 crisis</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers have discontinued business travel and are having their staff, except for “essential crews,” work from home as the government continues to encourage business to shut down.</p>
<p>All public events at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex and Heinz Field have been canceled. Steelers pro shops will close for the next two weeks.</p>
<p>“We will continue to be in contact with our partners at UMPC as well as local health officials to gather information,” team spokesman Burt Lauten said in a statement. “Our primary focus is to ensure the safety and health of our employees and families, and the communities around the Pittsburgh area.”</p>
