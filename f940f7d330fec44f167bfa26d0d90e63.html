<h1>Buying Here: Who wouldn't want to work out or relax in this $3.25 million estate?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Those who crave fitness over Fudgsicles and have an equally healthy bank account will love <strong>141 Beech Ridge Drive</strong> in Bell Acres.</p>
<p>Its nearly 8 acres and 22,000 square feet of living space include a full&nbsp;gymnasium with half basketball court, a squash court and a huge in-ground swimming pool. When you need a break, there’s a sauna, media room and wine room — the perfect place for a family to ride out the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The property (MLS No.1416306) is on the market for $3.25 million and listed with Kathe Barge of Howard Hanna Real Estate Services (412-779-6060 or <a href="https://www.howardhanna.com/Property/Detail/141-Beech-Ridge-Drive-Bell-Acres-PA-15143/Westpenn/1416306" target="_blank">www.howardhanna.com</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Both my wife, Heidi, and I are athletic and our kids are athletic so with the squash court and half basketball court, it was a real draw for us when we bought it,” said owner Rick Zomnir.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After purchasing the property in October 2004, the family added a waterfall, spacious patio with fireplace and a 60- by- 30-foot saltwater pool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are fireplaces in the living room, dining room, master bedroom, billiards room and two more on covered porches outside the master suite and the billiards room. There is no lack of warmth in this home, especially when you consider all the stained woodwork.</p>
<p>The orignial owner, Hal Wrigley, contracted with Ed Cress to build the house in 1997.</p>
<p>“Mr. Wrigley &nbsp;was a bachelor and he used to train professional boxers as a hobby,” said Mr. Zomnir. &nbsp;“He manufactured the Robogrip pliers you see sold everywhere.”</p>
<p>The house has six bedrooms, six full bathrooms and four powder rooms. It also&nbsp;boasts two studies, one with oak paneling and built-in bookcases.</p>
<p>“It was really easy for my wife and I to be working at the same time and not be on top of each other during the day,” Mr. Zomnir said.</p>
<p>When the work day ended, they could retreat to the master suite with a wall of windows overlooking rolling hills and a fireplace, jetted tub and spa room.</p>
<p>“It overlooks the backyard,” Mr. Zomnir said.&nbsp;“You can open the doors up in the winter and be in your hot tub while it is snowing outside!”</p>
<p>There are two full kitchens, one a fully equipped caterer’s kitchen for entertaining. For convenience there are laundry rooms on each of the three floors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We really enjoyed the movie room and the billiards room as family,” Mr. Zomnir added.</p>
<p>Another unique feature is the observation deck at the top of the house that offers spectacular views of stars in the night sky or the sunrise.</p>
<p>“The next family who lives here will love it,”&nbsp; Mr. Zomnir said with confidence.</p>
<p>So why are they selling this mini-resort?</p>
<p>“My children are grown and on their own and it is a lot of house for just two people,” he said.</p>
<p>The Zomnirs have downsized to a home in the Heights of North Park.</p>
<p>“We probably wouldn’t have sold, but our children have moved away to Northern California and won’t be moving back to Pittsburgh. So two people living in all this space just doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>His daughter and her six children sometimes came for visits. “Honestly there is enough space that you wouldn’t even know they were there,” he laughed.</p>
<p>The property’s assessment is $1.9 million. Over the past three years, two homes have sold on Beech Ridge Drive for $775,500 in May 2019 and $1.45 million in June 2018 (<a href="http://www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/Search.aspx" target="_blank">www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/Search.aspx</a>).</p>
