<h1>Fayette County jail adjusts operations after inmates, officers test positive for COVID-19 </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Visitation to the Fayette County Prison will be halted for two and a half weeks after Fayette County officials said several officers and prisoners have tested positive for COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fayette County District Attorney Richard Bower said Friday that three correctional officers and two prisoners have tested positive for COVID-19. Officials with the county prison board were made aware of the outbreak on Tuesday and started to implement a new plan of procedures on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Impacted correctional officers have been quarantining at home, and the impacted inmates have been placed in a special area where they are away from others. New inmates are also being held in a separate section of the facility known as Range D for a 14-day quarantine before moving into the general population, Mr. Bower said.</p>
<p>Commonly touched surfaces such as switches and door handles are being sanitized, social distancing protocols are being observed and all inmates and staff are to wear personal protective equipment, according to Mr. Bower. Gowns and face shields are to be used in areas of close contact between staff and inmates. The county also received new decontamination units by AeroClave this week that were originally purchased in March. One of the units will be used to clean the prison and inmate transport vehicles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s interesting and from what I’m understanding it works really well,” Mr. Bower said. In addition to sanitizing the facility, Mr. Bower said all 150 inmates, 60 correctional officers and staff, and five other employees will be tested for COVID-19. They’ve already started testing on Thursday. Contract tracing will be used for staff and inmates who test positive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to an adjustment to cleaning procedures, visitation and public admittance into the prison have been suspended for at least two and a half weeks, and instead inmates will teleconference with family members, attorneys and bail bondsmen. Entering and exiting the prison will be limited to correctional officers and other staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Bowers said they are halting in-person preliminary hearings for inmates from the jail. For inmates who waive their right to be present physically at their preliminary hearings, Mr. Bower said the hearing can occur virtually on Skype or Zoom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think in these uncertain times, obviously you can’t predict what’s going to happen. I think with all the protocols we put in place and all the methods we’ve tried to do with face masks, hand sanitizer, all the things the CDC is telling us to do, and everything we’ve already implemented, everything we’re doing should help,” Mr. Bower said.</p>
