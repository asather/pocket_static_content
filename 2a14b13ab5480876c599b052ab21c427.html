<h1>City Theatre artistic producer Reginald L. Douglas exits for D.C. theater job</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Reginald L. Douglas is exiting City Theatre to become associate artistic director of Studio Theatre in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>The South Side’s company’s artistic producer since 2015 will begin his new job later this month. He joined City Theatre in August 2015, when then-artistic director Tracy Brigden grew her staff to include Douglas, managing director James McNeel and Clare Drobot as director of new play development.</p>
<p>The trio was instrumental in keeping City on an even keel and programming a transitional season after Brigden resigned suddenly in 2017, after 16 seasons. Marc Masterson, who preceded Brigden, returned to City as artistic director in 2018.</p>
<p>“My time at City Theatre has been truly life-changing and awe-inspiring,” Douglas said Tuesday. “I am so grateful to the amazing staff, past and present, and am very proud of the great work that we have done together. I will cherish the artistic memories and institutional milestones for years to come.</p>
<p>“Most important to me, though, are the friendships that I have fostered during these five years in Pittsburgh. These relationships are not bound by time or place and will thrive through this transition, and for that I am so grateful. I cannot thank the City Theatre staff and Pittsburgh arts community enough for being my collaborators and friends. I moved to Pittsburgh in 2015 for a job opportunity and I leave now with a family.”</p>
<p>In a statement from Studio Theatre, he also said he was “honored and deeply humbled” to be working with artistic director David Muse and his staff.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, he quickly became an in-demand director at City and elsewhere&nbsp;— he recently helmed the regional premiere of the off-Broadway work “Good Grief” at Point Park University&nbsp;— and “Berta, Berta” at the National Black Theatre Festival in North Carolina.</p>
<p>He also took a leadership role in championing diversity and equity within the Pittsburgh theater community, including a wide-ranging Equitable Casting town hall at the Stephen Foster Memorial in 2016.</p>
<p>He ended 2019 by directing City’s production of “One Night in Miami …,” a Post-Gazette top 10 pick for the best local productions of the year.</p>
<p>"While we will miss him tremendously, all of us at City Theatre wish Reg the very best in this next chapter and cannot wait to see the terrific work he will produce as associate artistic director at Studio Theatre,” Masterson said in a statement. “Reg has infused every aspect of City Theatre with his extraordinary talents and passion over the last five years. We extend our gratitude and thanks to our dear friend and colleague."</p>
<p>Whether City will begin a search to replace Douglas currently is under consideration.</p>
<p>Douglas, who turns 33 within days of starting his new job, is a member of the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society, serves on the board of directors of the National New Play Network and is a guest lecturer at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center’s National Theatre Institute.</p>
