<h1>WATCH: Steelers’ James Conner continues selfless streak by buying mom a house</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers fans have plenty of opinions on James Conner <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/02/james-conner-workout-covid-19-steelers-offseason/stories/202006020118" target="_blank">as a football player</a>, but as a person, it’s hard to view him as anything other than a generous spirit who takes care of his family based on his actions over the last month.</p>
<p>On the Fourth of July, the Steelers running back posted a video on Twitter where he surprised his mother by buying her a new house. Make sure you have a tissue box handy before you watch Conners’ mother break down in tears as her son holds her.</p>
<p>This is the second time in a month that Conner has presented a family member with a surprise gift after he <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/07/Steelers-James-Conner-surprise-father-new-truck-video/stories/202006070118" target="_blank">bought his father</a> a brand-new truck in early June.</p>
<p>Conner received praise for giving his mother “a place you can call home” from Steelers running back coach Eddie Faulkner, Browns receiver Jarvis Landry and the realtor who helped facilitate the surprise reveal.</p>
<p>Conner is just one of many athletes with Pittsburgh ties to tangibly show his parents how much they mean to him lately. On Father’s Day, Steelers rookie receiver Chase Claypool also <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/22/Current-former-Pittsburgh-athletes-give-dads-unforgettable-Father-s-Day-weekend/stories/202006220083" target="_blank">bought his father a new truck</a> and former Pitt running back Qadree Ollison beat Conner to the punch by getting his own father a house.</p>
<p>Though Conner probably had the most heartwarming Fourth of July weekend of any Steeler, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger tried to give him a run for his money by adopting not one, but seven puppies.</p>
<p>Whether seven is a nod to his jersey number, the Steelers’ quest for a seventh Super Bowl or just the number of puppies that happened to be in that litter is unclear.</p>
<p>While those two Steeler offensive stars spent their holiday adding to and taking care of their families, receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster kept the South Side lit Saturday night by putting on his own fireworks show.</p>
<p>How many of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/07/05/Pittsburgh-fireworks-task-force-july-4-fourth/stories/202007050118" target="_blank">131 fireworks-related complaint calls</a> Pittsburgh’s fireworks task force responded to last night were levied at Smith-Schuster’s display is also anyone’s guess.</p>
