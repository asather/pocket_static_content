<h1>Paul Zeise: Athletes and coaches have a voice, but others have the power</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If I were the king of the world, I would issue a moratorium on famous people issuing statements about racial injustice. In terms of effecting real change, statements denouncing bad things are as useful as thoughts and prayers. They have become tired cliches, and actions speak a lot louder than words.</p>
<p>Why are athletes supposed to be the leaders on things such as racial inequality and injustice?&nbsp;While it is important that they get involved in their communities and be a part of these kinds of discussions, they aren’t the ones we should be shaming into making statements.</p>
<p>Doctors, lawyers, Internet company CEOs, magistrates, judges, politicians — there are a whole lot of people who should be at the head of the line when it comes to these kinds of things. They are the ones who are most closely tied toward setting policy and writing laws.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to understand why people seem so obsessed with athletes making statements and talking about issues. The ones that do should be commended, but the ones that don’t ... well, maybe they just don’t know how to or don’t want to talk about their views. And that’s OK too, because that is no different than people in every other walk of life.</p>
<p>Institutional racism has been a part of this country’s fabric since it was founded. Many of the Founding Fathers were drawing up the Declaration of Independence while they themselves were slave owners, and black Americans have been fighting uphill ever since.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issues of racism, racial inequality and racial justice are extremely complicated and deep and aren’t easily solved. There certainly aren’t answers that can and will be solved by famous people issuing statements, nor can they be achieved in 250 characters on Twitter.</p>
<p>Politicians are who we should be calling on and shaming into action. They hold the real key to change.&nbsp;We shouldn’t waste one second of time trying to goad the Tom Bradys of the world into&nbsp;“speaking out.” Show me an athlete or coach who supports racism, and I’ll show you one who no longer has a job. We don’t need people to speak out against racism any more; we need people with the power to to take action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll give a great example: Last year, a number of studies determined that Pittsburgh is one of the most racially divided cities in the country and one of the least livable cities for blacks, especially black women. In December, the City Council passed and Mayor Bill Peduto&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2020/01/pittsburgh-racism-health-pollution-environmental-justice/603775/" target="_blank">signed several ordinances</a>&nbsp;that declared racism <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/12/11/Pittsburgh-City-council-racism-health-crisis-pension-offset-Burgess-Harris/stories/201912110101" target="_blank">a public health crisis</a>.&nbsp;The city government committed “to creating more racial equity opportunities in its hiring practices, diversity initiatives and in the way it implements policies,” among a number of other things.</p>
<p>All of that sounds impressive, but the question we should be asking isn’t who is speaking out about what. Rather, we should ask how these policies have been implemented. What action steps have been taken? Who is monitoring the tangible results?</p>
<p>Southern Cal offers another example. The school recently revoked the season tickets of a booster and said he is no longer welcome at USC after his racist posts on social media. That was done presumably by some combination of the school president and the athletic director — two people with the power to make real changes. I’m sure Reggie Bush, Matt Leinart and a whole host of other famous former USC athletes would issue statements renouncing that booster, but change did not come until those in charge committed to making it.</p>
<p>Athletes and famous people definitely have a voice and should be resources in communities because of their high profile. But change doesn’t happen just because they speak out. All across the county, the real power brokers need to have their feet held to the fire to get things done.</p>
