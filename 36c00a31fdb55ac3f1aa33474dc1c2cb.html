<h1>Specialty Luggage calling it quits after 76 years</h1>

<p>After 76 years, Specialty Luggage is packing it in for good.</p>
<p>The company, founded in Downtown Pittsburgh in 1944, is closing its last store located in the Waterworks Mall — a victim of the collapse of the travel industry caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>“There is next to nobody walking in the door,” owner Jeff Izenson said Wednesday, estimating business has fallen 85% since February as the novel coronavirus triggered nationwide lockdowns and many people stopped traveling.</p>
<p>“It’s one thing to be in retail now. It’s another thing to be in travel retail. People are not buying luggage,” he said..</p>
<p>At its peak, the specialty luggage business founded by Mr. Izenson’s grandfather and his two brothers operated four stores in the region. The next to last to close was the Downtown store on Liberty Avenue, which shut down last summer amid growing competition from online retailers.</p>
<p>The upscale brands Mr. Izenson carries — such as Tumi, Briggs &amp; Riley, Swiss Army and Thule — all sell directly to customers online. That made it tough to compete and forced him to consolidate his business.</p>
<p>“Online is an issue, but we can survive that. But this [coronavirus], I can’t survive. Traffic is next to nonexistent,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Izenson, 58, who started in the family business during the summer when he was 13, said he will miss his customers and feels bad for his five employees.</p>
<p>“They are professional and dedicated people,” he said, noting his general manager has been with him for 35 years.</p>
<p>Mr. Izenson owns some apartments and expects to focus on residential real estate after Specialty Luggage turns out the lights, probably in September.</p>
<p>The going-out-of business sale starts Thursday.</p>
