<h1>Gov. Wolf confirms 2 presumptive positive cases of coronavirus in Pa. </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf confirmed Friday morning the state’s first two presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, one in Delaware County and one in Wayne County.</p>
<p>The one individual is an adult from Wayne County and is currently in their home in isolation, according to <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/wolf-administration-confirms-two-presumptive-positive-cases-of-covid-19/" target="_blank">a press release</a> from the Governor’s office. The individual recently traveled to a country where COVID-19 is present.</p>
<p>The other individual is an adult from Delaware County and is also currently in their home in isolation, the release said. The individual recently traveled to an area of the U.S. where COVID-19 is present.</p>
<p>“We anticipated this very scenario and have been preparing for Pennsylvanians to become impacted by this virus,” Mr. Wolf said in the release. “This is not the first rapidly-spreading virus we have faced in our commonwealth and it will not be the last.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said the state is “prepared to mitigate the spread of this virus.”</p>
<p>The cases are "presumptive" because while the state's own test were positive for COVID-19, the state needs to confirm that finding with a sample tested by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's laboratory in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Both cases were tested at the state’s lab in Exton, Chester County. The state lab began testing Tuesday doing just six cases a day. That is up to 25 cases that can be tested per day now, and is expected to ramp up to 125 to 150 cases a day by next week, the state said Friday.</p>
<p>No other information on the people affected has been released.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf plans to sign a disaster declaration on Friday.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., released a statement after the announcement Friday afternoon, wishing those impacted by the virus a “speedy recovery.”</p>
<p>“The people of Pennsylvania wish a speedy recovery to those who have been impacted by Coronavirus and we stand ready to help those families,” the statement read. “Yesterday, Congress passed $8 billion in funding to combat the Coronavirus and I will push to make sure appropriate resources are sent to Pennsylvania quickly.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey urged all Pennsylvanians to follow the instructions of their medical provider, public health professionals as well as the CDC.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/corona2020/2020/03/06/Pa-school-district-near-Philadelphia-closes-five-schools-citing-coronavirus-exposure/stories/202003060114" target="_blank">classes were cancelled Friday</a> at five schools in an eastern Pennsylvania school district because some members of its school community were exposed to a confirmed case of the new coronavirus, district officials said.</p>
<p>Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine says the two cases confirmed in Pennsylvania are not related to the case that closed schools.</p>
<p>Central Bucks School District Superintendent John Kopicki said the decision to close the schools was made “out of an abundance of caution” after consultations with state and local health officials.</p>
<p>The people exposed to the virus were known to have “had contact” with the schools, but further details on those people and their interaction in the five schools were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The closed schools will undergo a “deep cleaning of all impacted facilities,” Mr. Kopicki said.</p>
<p>The coronavirus case that led to the closures originated in another state, Mr. Kopicki said, but further details were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Two Pittsburgh men <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/05/Pittsburgh-COVID-19-quarantine-Grand-Princess-Frank-Tallarico-Kyle-Cunningham/stories/202003050194" target="_blank">were being tested for COVID-19</a>&nbsp;by the Allegheny County Health Department Wednesday after disembarking from a cruise ship where at least one passenger who was on the ship died from the virus this week in California.</p>
<p>The tests came back negative, however the men were still under quarantine Thursday evening. A second set of samples for the two men was sent to be processed by CDC before the couple can be released from quarantine.</p>
