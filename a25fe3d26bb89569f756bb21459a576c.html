<p>Allegheny County health officials reported Tuesday that two more people have died due to COVID-19, as the number of deaths statewide surged to 78 additional deaths.</p>
<p>The new total of six deaths in the county include five people who were hospitalized – one person in their 60s, two in their 70s, one in their 80s, and one in their 90s, officials said. One individual who died was not hospitalized; that person was in their 70s.</p>

<p>Health officials said that of the 689 county cases&nbsp;of the viral disease -— up by 47 from the preceding day —&nbsp;a total of 101&nbsp;people have needed hospitalization, past or present. That was an increase of nine hospitalizations from Monday’s reported numbers.</p>
<p>In total, the pandemic has killed 240 people throughout Pennsylvania, according to state Department of Health figures released Tuesday.&nbsp;The largest number of deaths in Western Pennsylvania have been reported in Beaver County, where the state reported 9 deaths and 116 confirmed cases; <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/07/Beaver-County-COVID-19-cases-surge-to-13/stories/202004070094" target="_blank">the county coroner, however, has reported 13 deaths</a>.</p>
<p>Other deaths reported in the region were in Cambria County, which reported its first death from the virus (and 7 cases); 2 deaths each were reported in Butler County (102 cases) and Lawrence County (29 cases); and Fayette County had 1 death (and 32 cases), according to state figures.</p>
<p>Statewide, health officials said the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases jumped to 14,559, rising in one day by 1,579.&nbsp;Philadelphia County leads the state in the number of cases with 4,012 and in deaths at 58.</p>

<p>Gov. Tom Wolf last week extended his stay-at-home order to all 12.8 million people in Pennsylvania amid a growing number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.</p>
<p>The governor and state Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine also are <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/04/03/Wolf-asks-all-Pennsylvanians-to-wear-masks/stories/202004030156" target="_blank">asking all residents to wear a cloth or homemade mask</a> whenever leaving the home.&nbsp;Both emphasized that mask-wearing does not change the primary social distancing guidance, to stay at home whenever possible and maintain 6 feet of distance from other people whenever in public. Mask-wearing in public, they said, should only be for “life-sustaining” excursions from the home, such as trips to grocery stores, pharmacies and to take care of the elderly.</p>
<p>“The continued rise in cases combined with our increasing deaths from COVID-19 reflects the seriousness of this situation,” Dr. Levine said. “We need everyone to listen to the orders in place and to stay calm, stay home and stay safe.</p>
<p>“We know that these prolonged mitigation effects have been difficult for everyone, but it is essential that everyone follows these orders and does not go out unless they absolutely must.”</p>
