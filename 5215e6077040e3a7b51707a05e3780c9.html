<h1>The day that word came that William Hull had surrendered Fort Detroit </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three months into the War of 1812, news of a military disaster reached Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. William Hull, an American Revolution veteran, governor of the Michigan territory, and commander of the North West Army of the United States, had surrendered the strategically located Fort Detroit to British Maj. Gen. Isaac Brock.</p>
<p>A postal rider from Warren, Ohio, delivered the news to Pittsburgh postmaster John Johnston. More than 200 years ago, the Pittsburgh Gazette, a predecessor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, published the story on Aug. 23, 1812, “with heartfelt regret.”</p>
<p>Located 300 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, Fort Detroit connected to Western Pennsylvania by Indian trails.</p>
<p>“The alarm in Pittsburgh was because the British had Indian allies. They knew that the Indian allies would be raiding into Ohio after the British captured Detroit,” said Alan Taylor, professor of history at the University of Virginia and author of “The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels and Indian Allies.”</p>
<p>Some Pittsburghers feared retaliation.</p>
<p>“The concern was that those Indian raids could extend into Western Pennsylvania. That’s an exaggerated fear. Indian raids at that time did not extend that far south and east,” Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<p>“But people can get alarmed about things. Being afraid of things is a very American trait, unfortunately,” he added.</p>
<p>“The fear may have been exaggerated but it wasn’t unfounded,” said Andrew E. Masich, president and chief executive officer of the Sen. John Heinz History Center in the Strip District.</p>
<p>Tecumseh, a charismatic warrior, was leading Delaware, Huron and Wyandot warriors whose lands had been taken by insatiable white settlers.</p>
<p>“These Western Indian peoples found good allies in the British. The British were quick to enlist them, arm them and treat them with respect. Brock really hit it off with Tecumseh. He believed he was the noblest Indian and a man of great genius,” Mr. Masich said.</p>
<p>At Fort Detroit, Tecumseh and Brock’s forces “took on an American force twice their size. They made the Americans think they were vastly outnumbered. Instead of company messes, each man . . . lit a fire at night so Fort Detroit was ringed with camp fires when the siege began,” Mr. Masich said.</p>
<p>Tecumseh’s warriors appeared in the open so the Americans could see them, then hunkered down. The same men retreated into the forest and reappeared. The tactics unnerved some American officers and Hull.</p>
<p>“He was past his prime as a field commander. His junior officers said, ‘Look, we’ve got to fight this out. We have enough shot and powder to resist this force.’ Hull lost his nerve. Some speculate that his daughter was there in the force with them. He was worried about her safety,” Mr. Masich said.</p>
<p>Hull’s surrender, Mr. Masich said, “left Lake Erie open to the British. The British and Tecumseh held sway over upstate New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio because they controlled Lake Erie. I think there was legitimate danger in Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, Michigan and Indiana after this defeat.”</p>
<p>A year later, in September 1813, the war’s course turned during the battle for Lake Erie.</p>
<p>During that battle, Oliver Hazard Perry fought aboard the USS Lawrence, named for his late friend, Capt. James Lawrence.</p>
<p>After he was mortally wounded in June 1813, Lawrence told his men aboard the USS Chesapeake, “Don’t give up the ship. Fight her till she sinks.”</p>
<p>“Perry had those words sewn onto a blue flag that became his battle flag on Lake Erie,” Mr. Masich said. Later, Stephen Foster, the composer and musician, named Lawrenceville for Captain Lawrence.</p>
<p>American troops forced the British fleet to surrender on Lake Erie.</p>
<p>“All of the gains won by Brock and Tecumseh now get thrown out because the Americans now control Lake Erie,” Mr. Masich said.</p>
<p>As for Hull, some saw him as a traitor. He was court-martialed, convicted and sentenced to be executed. But President James Madison pardoned him because of his military service during the American Revolution and spared his life.</p>
