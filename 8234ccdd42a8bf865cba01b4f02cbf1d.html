<h1>Gun permit office closed to protect workers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The temporary closing of the Firearms Division at Allegheny County Courts had nothing to do with curtailing concealed-carry firearm permits, said Allegheny County Sheriff Bill Mullen. The office was closed to protect its workers from contact with people who might have COVID-19.</p>
<p>“We usually get 75 to 100 people a day coming in for concealed-carry permits. Yesterday we had more than double that, 197,” he said.</p>
<p>With concerns that people infected with COVID-19 may interact with employees of the Firearms Division, at 3 p.m. Monday the office was temporarily closed for two weeks.</p>
<p>“We’ll take a look at it then and decide what to do,” said Sheriff Mullen.</p>
<p>A message on the sheriff’s office website stated that for Allegheny County residents who want to renew expiring concealed-carry permits, “as long as you are eligible to renew your license, said license is still valid for six months beyond the printed expiration date on the license.”</p>
<p>Those seeking applications for new concealed-carry permits will have to wait.</p>
<p>“We’re obligated by the Constitution to make sure people have access [to firearms] and we’ll catch up with [concealed-carry] permits when this is over,” he said.</p>
