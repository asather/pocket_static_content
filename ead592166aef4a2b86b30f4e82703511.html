<h1>Chartiers Valley storms past Thomas Jefferson; Trinity outlasts Woodland Hills</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The last time Chartiers Valley and Thomas Jefferson met in girls basketball, Perri Page’s buzzer-beating layup gave the Colts a one-point win — though most Jaguars supporters disputed the call, claiming that the ball was still in Page’s hand when time expired.</p>
<p>Chartiers Valley made sure there would be no such drama this time around.</p>
<p>The Colts came out in attack mode from the opening tip and never gave Thomas Jefferson (18-7) a chance to catch its breath. Chartiers Valley (24-0) opened the game on a 19-0 run and held the Jaguars without a point until 26.1 seconds remained in the first quarter on its way to a commanding 65-43 win.</p>
<p>Colts sophomore guard Hallie Cowan scored a career-high 29 points in the win, including six 3-pointers. Senior point guard Megan McConnell added 15 points for Chartiers Valley, which extended its winning streak to 54 consecutive games.</p>
<p>“I was just feeling it tonight,” Cowan said. “I just knew that I was on. I just kept going and shooting, and they were falling for me.”</p>
<p>After the last meeting, the Jaguars designed T-shirts alluding to the extra time put on the clock before the final inbounds pass. Colts coach Tim McConnell wanted to thank Thomas Jefferson for the added motivation, even extending a special offer to whoever came up with the idea.</p>
<p>“Our girls were focused,” Tim McConnell said. “We kept hearing about this, ‘3.1 doesn’t equal 4.4,’ and these T-shirts being made up.</p>
<p>“Whoever made those up, I’d like to take them to dinner one night, because they gave us great motivation and great focus on this game.”</p>
<p>With Chartiers Valley taking a 19-2 lead after the opening quarter, the Jaguars’ chances of pulling off the upset appeared to go out the window by the time the second quarter got started.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson then opened up the second quarter on a 9-2 run to cut Chartiers Valley’s lead to 10, and for a second, the Jaguars had life. They kept fighting until the end, but they couldn’t quite get the game back to single digits as Cowan’s lights-out shooting carried the Colts back to Petersen Events Center to defend their WPIAL Class 5A championship on Saturday at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>“I think we executed everything head to toe what my dad told us to do,” Megan McConnell said. “I don’t think they knew what hit them in the beginning. I think we really executed our plays well. We defended, we rebounded.</p>
<p>“And shout out to my girl Hallie. She was on fire tonight.”</p>
<p><strong>Other semifinal</strong></p>
<p>It’s going to be a family affair in the WPIAL Class 5A championship game.</p>
<p>After getting off to a slow start, Trinity came alive in the second quarter and shut Woodland Hills down the rest of the way for a 50-33 win in the first Class 5A semifinal Wednesday night at Mt. Lebanon. First-year coach Kathy McConnell-Miller has the Hillers (19-4) back in the WPIAL title game in her debut season, and waiting for them at Petersen Events Center will be the undefeated Chartiers Valley Colts — coached by her older brother, Tim McConnell.</p>
<p>“When I took over this job, they communicated. They had no problem sharing what their goals were, and one of their goals was to play for a WPIAL championship,” McConnell-Miller said about her players. “I’m proud of them for articulating that and committing themselves to being a team that can compete for a WPIAL championship.</p>
<p>“We’ve had some great games this year and we’ve had some games where we struggled, but the biggest accomplishment is that they continue to persevere, game in and game out.”</p>
<p>Trinity senior guard Riley DeRubbo led all players with 18 points, while junior forward Courtney Dahlquist contributed 10. Senior forward Joi Burleigh led the Wolverines (19-5) with 11 points in the defeat.</p>
<p>“I’m super excited,” DeRubbo said. “I’ve never been [to the WPIAL championship], so it’s something I’ve always wanted to experience.”</p>
<p>Woodland Hills took a 10-7 lead at the end of the first quarter, but that’s when things started to unravel for the Wolverines. Both offenses went cold in the second quarter, but the Hillers started to find their rhythm late in the period. Junior guard Kaylin Venick closed out the half with a fast-break layup to cap off an 8-0 run for Trinity as the Hillers took a 19-14 advantage into the break.</p>
<p>Junior forward Peyton Pinkney converted back-to-back baskets in the paint to regain some momentum for Woodland Hills midway through the third quarter, but DeRubbo followed with a fast-break layup to put Trinity back up by eight. The Hillers stretched their lead to double digits early in the fourth quarter and never looked back as they pulled away for a 50-33 win.</p>
<p>Now heading to the title game against the unbeaten defending champions, McConnell-Miller said she’ll have one simple message to deliver to her team before the game.</p>
<p>“Enjoy this moment,” McConell-Miller said. “It is something you’ll remember for the rest of your life.”</p>
