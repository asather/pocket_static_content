<p>Momentum can be a precious and highly valued concept in sports for teams fortunate enough to build it, even in what has been an indisputably down year for the ACC, often regarded as the best conference in college basketball.</p>
<p>For a Pitt program that hadn’t won consecutive conference games in nearly three years -- and is seldom presented with opportunities as good as it had Wednesday to do so -- that’s especially true.</p>
<p>A team whose game-to-game performances this season can be as predictable as Powerball numbers has, at last, gained some sense of traction during the months of January and February -- but just barely.</p>
<p>Freshman forward Justin Champagnie ignited what had been a struggling Pitt offense for much of the first half, finishing with 17 points and 10 rebounds, and guard Ryan Murphy made a game-winning jumper from the free-throw line with four seconds remaining to avoid a last-minute collapse as Pitt defeated Boston College, 74-72, Wednesday at Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>It marked the first time they have won back-to-back ACC games since Feb. 2017, when the first of those victories came against, coincidentally enough, Boston College.</p>
<p>The difference between the first and second half, for Pitt, was staggering. After shooting 42.9% in the first half, it made 62.1% of its field goal attempts in the second. An Eagles squad that entered the day as the ACC’s worst offense -- averaging just 96.3 points per 100 possessions, ranking them 277th among 351 Division I teams -- shot 47.6% overall and 54.5% from 3-point range in the first half, but went 30.8% from 3 in the final 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Pitt recovered from a nightmarish opening 17 minutes to the game, a period in which it was outscored by 14, to outscore the Eagles, 17-0, over the ensuing six minutes (stretched over the first and second periods). Champagnie and guard Trey McGowens combined for 12 of those 17 points.</p>
<p>Though Boston College recovered a bit, it could only contain that surge so much. Trailing by one, 45-44, the Panthers scored 16 of the game’s next 22 points to build a nine-point lead, their largest advantage of the game, after Toney skied for a tip-in with 7:37 to play. Murphy accounted for six of those points, making two 3s.</p>
<p>A Derryck Thornton steal and layup off a McGowens turnover got the Eagles within two, 72-70, with 29 seconds remaining. Boston College, rather improbably, forced a steal on the ensuing inbounds pass and converted on that opportunity, getting a layup from Thornton to tie the game with 12 seconds to play.</p>
<p>Pitt responded quickly, getting the ball back in and Murphy, with the ball near midcourt, worked his way near the basket and found enough room to pull up from inside the top of the 3-point arc, draining a shot that sent an anxious crowd into something between joy and relief. The Eagles’ chances at a win were ended when Champagnie stole the inbounds pass and Pitt dribbled out the clock.</p>
<p>The end result for the Panthers was a hard-earned, occasionally infuriating victory against a struggling Boston College team that had lost its previous three games by a combined 63 points as many of its key players were either injured or ill. In an 18-point loss last Sunday against Wake Forest, the Eagles dressed only seven scholarship players. Against Pitt, one of their more notable absences returned to the court, as forward Nik Popovic, the team’s third leading scorer, played his first game since early December after dealing with a back injury.</p>
<p>Sophomore forward Au’Diese Toney finished with 16 points, nine of which came in the first half and kept his team afloat offensively when it easily could have drowned. McGowens also finished in double figures, with 14 points, and guard Xavier Johnson added 10 assists.</p>
<p>A team keeping whatever confidence and euphoria it had from a season sweep of North Carolina that was completed last Saturday was nowhere to be seen for much of the first half, making a large portion of the opening 20 minutes feel like a basketball version of Murphy’s Law (not the Ryan Murphy variety).</p>
<p>Pitt went the first 4:42 without a made field goal, a rut that didn’t allow it to capitalize on sloppy play from the Eagles, who had four turnovers in the game’s opening 2:22. What had been an ineffective Boston College offense for so much of the season had its way against various zone defenses Pitt employed for extended stretches in the first half. It scored 21 points on its first 16 possessions, made seven of its first 11 shots and six of its first 10 3s, many of which were clean, open looks.</p>
