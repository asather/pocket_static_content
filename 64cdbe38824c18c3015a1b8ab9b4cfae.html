<h1>Toomey: 'Not at all convinced' senators need to hear from witnesses in Trump trial</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., on Wednesday pushed back on reports that he advocated to call witnesses in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial during a lunch with Republican senators this week, saying he was&nbsp;“not at all convinced” senators need to hear from witnesses.</p>
<p>The senator told reporters he remained&nbsp;“very skeptical” of calling Mr. Trump’s former national security advisor, John Bolton, even after details from Mr. Bolton’s upcoming book leaked to the press.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey said his remarks to other senators were mischaracterized.&nbsp;Rather than calling for Mr. Bolton to testify, Mr. Toomey said, he had said Republicans should merely prepare for the possibility and be ready with a demand that they choose a witness of their own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I would underscore I am not taking the position that we ought to have Bolton and some other witnesses,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>The witness that Republicans could choose to call, he said, were Hunter Biden or his father, former Vice President Joe Biden.&nbsp;The core of Mr. Trump’s impeachment case is whether the president abused his power in pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.</p>
<p>The White House defense team has argued this week that Mr. Trump’s demand was legitimate because Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma, while his father pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the company.</p>
<p>“The Bidens are very much relevant to this debate over impeachment,” he said.&nbsp;“The House managers have rested a tremendous amount of their case on the notion that President Trump could not possibly have had any motive whatsoever for asking for an investigation.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When you look at the facts involving Hunter Biden and Burisma — it’s begging for an investigation about corruption,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>At least one Democratic senator agrees with Mr. Toomey.</p>
<p>Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he would consider Hunter Biden a relevant witness.</p>
<p>“I want people to tell me what you know,”&nbsp;Mr. Manchin said.&nbsp;“We have an obligation and a responsibility to have thorough trial. How do you have a trial without witnesses and evidence?”</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s comments came as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., scrambled to get the votes he needs to block witnesses ahead of a Friday session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several Republican senators seemed open to the idea, particularly after The New York Times reported Mr. Bolton’s book claims Mr. Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine for personal political reasons.</p>
<p>Sen. Susan Collins, R-Me., and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, have both said that report strengthened the case to come to some kind of deal to call witnesses. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are two others who are thought to be open to the idea.</p>
<p>Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., told NPR on Wednesday he wants to read Mr. Bolton’s manuscript to determine if Mr. Bolton would be a “relevant witness” to call in the trial. Mr. Lankford said he remained unconvinced Mr. Bolton would be relevant to the case, despite witness testimony that links Mr. Bolton to discussions over the Ukraine aid.</p>
