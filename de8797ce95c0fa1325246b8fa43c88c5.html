<h1>Despite cancellation, some Pittsburgh artists are still headed to SXSW</h1>

<p>The show is still going on in Austin, Texas, for some Pittsburgh artists.</p>
<p>The annual SXSW music, art, film and technology festival was canceled Friday by Austin’s mayor due to fears over the spread of COVID-19. It’s the first cancellation in 34 years for the festival, which last year drew more than 400,000 people from around the world and generated an estimated $356 million.</p>
<p>On Saturday, club owners, managers and promoters in Austin met to keep the venues filled for an “unofficial” SXSW. They created a Facebook group called “Alt SXSW 2020!:</p>
<p>On Monday afternoon, Pittsburgh garage-rock band The Nox Boys was driving through San Antonio, Texas, on its Southwest tour. They’ll be doing at least five of the six shows they planned to do in Austin during SXSW, including one at Antone’s Records on March 21.</p>
<p>“We signed up to be an official SXSW artist last year,” said frontman Zack Keim, “but this year we were doing the ‘unofficial’ shows.”</p>
<p>Even with the official SXSW canceled, Keim said, “I don’t think that it’s going to be that big a deal for us. I think a lot of the touring bands are still playing the shows that were planned.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh label Crafted Sounds is keeping its showcase at the Big Easy Bar &amp; Grill on March 19. It includes Pittsburgh artists Merce Lemon, Flower Crown and The Zells.</p>
<p>“[We’re] working against the clock to make something happen,” says Crafted Sounds label manager Connor Murray. “Plans got shuffled as not all of the acts on the original lineup are going down now.”</p>
<p>They might even have a second day to their event due to club openings.</p>
<p>Two other Pittsburgh artists, rapper Benji. and funk band Feralcat, led by saxophonist Roger Romero, have abandoned their trips to Texas because their official SXSW showcases were canceled.</p>
<p>“Roger is a good friend of mine and I’m pretty tight with his band as well, so we were all looking forward to meeting up in Austin to really just live in the moment and celebrate each other as Pittsburgh artists and musicians who are advancing beyond the local threshold,” Benji. said. “There were a few artists and bands from Pittsburgh that were headed up to SXSW, which would have been great for our city. It’s just an unfortunate situation, but safety should always be the main priority and hopefully this thing can be contained enough to continue doing what we love.”</p>
<p>“I can’t really tell if it was right, wrong, or even that concrete an answer,” Romero said of the decision to cancel. “I don’t know the powers at play, but I am beginning to think that this virus is going to continue to affect the course of live entertainment.”</p>
<p>The organizers of Coachella, which is scheduled for April in Indio, California, are weighing their options as the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in that area. Pittsburgh band Code Orange is scheduled to play Coachella on April 10 and 17.</p>
<p>The Nox Boys have a bigger issue with their April plans. The band is scheduled to do Spain and then fly to Milan for two weeks in Italy, which has been hard hit by COVID-19.</p>
<p>“If things don’t get better there, we’ll have to cancel the Italy dates,” Keim said.</p>
