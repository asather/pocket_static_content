<h1>Overcoming adversity: how low-income area public schools achieve high performance</h1>

<p>After dropping off her grandchildren at Park Elementary School in Munhall, Tisha Kenney remembers coming home and bursting into tears.</p>
<p>It had been a while since Ms. Kenney, 47, had to parent again. After her daughter unexpectedly died last October, she was left to grieve the loss of her child while taking full custody of her grandchildren.</p>
<p>One of her biggest worries after assuming a new parent role was how her granddaughters, Peyton and Paige, would react to moving to a different home and elementary school. Her daughter, who lived in Duquesne, had her grandchildren attend Young Scholars of McKeesport Charter School. She recalls her grandchildren having a tough time there, and it being a “headache every day,” so she decided to have them attend the school down her street – Park Elementary School.</p>
<p>Ms. Kenney’s grandchildren immediately loved the school. “I don’t care about whether it’s a charter school or public school – nothing compares to Park,” Ms. Kenney said, overcome with relief at finding the perfect school for them.</p>
<p>“They don’t know how easy it is for me to drop them off and go to work and not have to worry about whether they are having a good time,” Ms. Kenney said.</p>
<p>“Park is the greatest school ever – they know you by your first name,” Ms. Kenney said. “If you’re having a bad week, and you drop your kids off at school, you would no longer have a bad morning.”</p>
<p>More and more people, like Ms. Kenney, are recognizing Park Elementary School’s impact. Principal Tom Shaughnessy said two years ago Park Elementary School, in the Steel Valley School District, had 293 students, and now 339 students are enrolled.</p>
<p>With over half of its students reported to be economically disadvantaged, Park Elementary School has continued to <strong>outperform most schools in Allegheny County</strong> despite being located in a historically low income area.</p>
<p>Design/development: XXXXXXX/Post-Gazette</p>
<p>Performance in Pennsylvania schools are based on the state Department of Education’s “building scores,” calculated by factors including math and reading PSSA or Keystone test scores, graduation rates and attendance rates.</p>
<p>While dozens of elementary schools around Allegheny County performed better than Park, they were generally in districts with higher median incomes – such as Upper St. Clair, North Allegheny and Pine-Richland. However, with a score of 83.2, Park Elementary scored higher than every school in Quaker Valley, South Fayette and North Hills – which are considered wealthier suburban areas of Allegheny County.</p>
<p>“Wealthy suburban schools with low percentages of students with special needs have a huge advantage over us because of how the scores are calculated, but we are still outperforming them,” Mr. Shaughnessy said, citing how 24% of students enrolled at his school have special needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of a high performance score, Park Elementary was recognized by Apple as an Apple Distinguished School. It also is one of the schools across the state asked to be a model school to help the Pennsylvania Department of Education work with the National Center on Education and the Economy’s project to create a statewide advanced credentialing system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 20 miles east of Downtown Pittsburgh, Trafford Elementary School, in the Penn-Trafford School District, also took home a high performing score – with 84.5%.</p>
<p>At Trafford Elementary, 38.8% of students are reported to be economically disadvantaged, according to the Department of Education. There are 0.5% of the students reported to be homeless.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overcoming obstacles</strong></p>
<p>With a student demographic such as Trafford’s, the school’s principal, Dan DiNapoli, understands the impact economic situations have on a student's learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Kids go home to different environments,” Mr. DiNapoli said. Parents with low-wage jobs may not have the traditional 9 a.m.-to-5 p.m. work schedule, so by the time children come home from school, their parents may be leaving for work.</p>
<p>“The help they get at home may not be as much as someone who is on a higher income,” Mr. DiNapoli said. “But I see at Trafford, those parents really care about their child and their school.”</p>
<p>“Residential mobility,” or how many times a child has changed their address, also can have an effect on a child’s health and learning, said Chris Lilienthal, director of communications for the Pennsylvania State Education Association.</p>
<p>“Mobility can have just as much of an impact on student learning as poverty,” Mr. Lilienthal said. “It can affect a student's health and well being. Also their language development.”</p>
<p>According to Brown University’s Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Institute, having three or more moves in a childhood is associated with “decreased self-regulation/curiosity and school engagement” for children between the ages of 6 and 17 years old.</p>
<p>Throughout her 20-year teaching tenure, Katie Pugh, a third grade math teacher at Park Elementary, has noticed an increase of transient students in her classes. One of her biggest goals is to form a bond with each of her students, but that can be a challenge with students who are attending for only a short period of time.</p>
<p>“I think their foundations of education is different, so it’s always a challenge to see where they are coming from,” Ms. Pugh said. “And when you get a grasp of who they are, they’re gone again. So you’re trying to fight that battle, all the time.”</p>
<p>Regulating emotions can also be a challenge for students. If one of her students acts out in class, Ms. Pugh said, she tries to approach the situation with empathy by understanding what is causing them to misbehave and then acknowledging and validating their emotions.</p>
<p>Part of what contributes to the success of a student's performance at the elementary school is the centralization of resources in the Penn-Trafford School District. Every student has access to the same resources and the same staffing, Mr. DiNapoli said. Trafford Elementary’s third grade teachers, Mick Bujdos and Amy Sipple, said having readily available resources, from textbooks to index cards, has made a huge difference in their classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. DiNapoli said the state’s annual performance scores don’t necessarily paint the full future of a school’s growth.</p>
<p>“At the end, whenever those scores are released and printed, they’re not looking at the bullying prevention program or the different classes or fundraisers that a school helps with in the community,” Mr. DiNapoli said. “That kind of goes to the wayside. Everyone just looks at the reading and math state scores.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of pressure on these kids.”</p>
<p><strong>Improving the ratio</strong></p>
<p>Ever since a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018, Pennsylvania has been providing about $60 million in “school safety grants.” Over $600,000 is awarded to school districts in the Mon Valley, according to a press release from state Rep. Austin Davis, D-Allegheny. While these grants have primarily been used to fund school building security projects, Mr. Lilienthal said PSEA is advocating use of the money to hire more staff, such as nurses, counselors, psychologists, social workers and teaching assistants.</p>
<p>“Educators in schools can really have a tremendous impact on a student who may be living in poverty,” Mr. Lilienthal said. “There’s studies that have shown students who have one adult connection at school will actually do better over time.”</p>
<p>In a paper by Harvard University’s Center on the Developing Child, scientists found that at least one supportive relationship and multiple opportunities for developing effective coping skills are “essential building blocks for the capacity to do well in the face of significant adversity.”</p>
<p>Mr. DiNapoli would agree. In his school district, each building has two student learning assistants who are contracted for the school year. They’re primarily focusing on assisting in math and reading classes, as a way to further individualize a student’s learning.</p>
<p>“That’s a key component for us,” Mr. DiNapoli said. On average, Trafford Elementary’s student-to-teacher ratio is about 14-to-1. With an assistant teacher in the room, the class can be split into multiple groups, allowing teachers to focus on a smaller set of students and cater a different style of learning. Having a low student-to-teacher ratio helps children become more comfortable with the material they’re trying to learn, Mr. DiNapoli said.</p>
<p>Providing emotional support for students has increased at Trafford as well. Mr. DiNapoli said the number of students seeking therapy has increased throughout the years.</p>
<p>“No longer do the parents have to wait for the kids to be home or take them out of school to get an appointment. It happens at school now, they come to us,” Mr. DiNapoli said.</p>
<p><strong>Building trust</strong></p>
<p>Alongside legislative change, Mr. DiNapoli said a key component to a child’s success is building the trust between the teacher, parent and student. This way, parents understand the expectations teachers place on students and can reinforce those values at home.</p>
<p>“It takes a lot of pressure off of that child, and they don’t even know it. Because they know that what's happening at school will be supported at home,” Mr. DiNapoli said.</p>
<p>Parent involvement in a child’s education is a key for success, said Jodi Strom, the mother of Park Elementary fourth grader Josie Strom. At Park Elementary, parents can access an app on their electronic devices called “ClassDojo,” where parents can receive updates on a child’s attendance, grades and even access to study guides for tests. This allows her to stay connected with what’s going on at her daughter’s school and in contact with her teachers.</p>
<p>As a native of Munhall, Ms. Strom grew up around the time everyone was getting laid off from the steel mills and migrating out of the area to find work. Ms. Strom said she made sure her family stayed in the area.</p>
<p>While she moved nearby to West Homestead, Ms. Strom said she wanted to make sure her daughter attended Park Elementary School, where she once attended.</p>
<p>“I’m just proud to be an Ironman,” Ms. Strom said. “I’ve lived here for 40 years, and it’s where we’re going to stay.”</p>
