<h1>State Supreme Court hears argument on medical marijuana restrictions for probationers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania on Tuesday asked the state Supreme Court to declare illegal a policy in Lebanon County courts that prohibits people on probation from using medical marijuana.</p>
<p>The argument, on behalf of three probationers there, comes about nine months after Lebanon County Probation Services implemented the policy prohibiting the active use of medical marijuana, even with a properly obtained medical marijuana card.</p>
<p>Under the policy dated Sept. 1, the court system gave probationers 30 days to stop the use of medical marijuana or be subject to violating the conditions of their release.</p>
<p>The ACLU filed a King’s Bench request with the state Supreme Court to quickly take up the case, and Lebanon County was enjoined from enforcing the policy while it is pending.</p>
<p>The court’s decision could have an impact on the rest of the state. According to the ACLU complaint, several other counties have implemented or are considering similar policies, including Lycoming, Jefferson, Elk, Forest, Potter, Indiana and Northampton.</p>
<p>The court systems in Allegheny, Philadelphia and Centre counties allow people on supervised release to use medical marijuana, the complaint said.</p>
<p>During the 37-minute oral argument -- broadcast over YouTube as the justices of the court participated via video conference -- ACLU attorney Sara Rose argued that Pennsylvania’s Medical Marijuana Act provides sweeping immunity to those who use it.</p>
<p>Patients cannot be subject to arrest or prosecution in any manner simply for using medical marijuana, she said.</p>
<p>“The Legislature intended to protect people from retaliation,” Ms. Rose argued.</p>
<p>If, however, a probationer violates the terms of the Medical Marijuana Act, she continued, that is a misdemeanor under the law and can be enforced by the courts. In addition, the act does not prohibit a person from being prosecuted for committing any other crime while using medical marijuana, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the three petitioners in the case use medical marijuana for serious medical conditions and have obtained substantial relief, Ms. Rose said.</p>
<p>The lead petitioner in the case, Melissa Gass, has recurring grand mal seizures, stemming from a car crash when she was 10 years old. Her her head struck the windshield of the car in which she was traveling.</p>
<p>She is now 42.</p>
<p>According to a filing in the case, when her seizures are not treated with marijuana, Ms. Gass has multiple seizures each week, and sometimes multiple per day.</p>
<p>She is on probation for simple assault — stemming from an incident in February 2016 in which she struck her husband.</p>
<p>According to an affidavit in the case, Ms. Gass started using medical marijuana after her probation officer suggested it could help her.</p>
<p>Once she obtained her medical marijuana card, Ms. Gass said, her seizures reduced from multiple times each day to just a few each month. She was also able to reduce or stop several other medications that she had been taking to try to control her condition.</p>
<p>However, after she stopped using medical marijuana on Oct. 4 as a result of the Lebanon County policy, she had six or seven seizures in one day and has been hospitalized repeatedly because of them.</p>
<p>More than a month after the policy was initially implemented, Lebanon County amended it to include a carve-out for probationers to petition the court for an exception -- by proving medical necessity.</p>
<p>However, in her argument, Ms. Rose said the exception does not specify what is required to prove medical necessity and puts the burden on the person on supervision.</p>
<p>“What the trial court can’t do is prohibit an individual from doing something the Legislature allows them to do,” Ms. Rose said.</p>
<p>To obtain a medical marijuana card, Ms. Rose said, a person must be diagnosed with one of the enumerated medical conditions listed in the statute; be a Pennsylvania resident and be certified by a state-approved physician.</p>
<p>But Robert Krandel, an attorney with the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts who represented Lebanon County’s court system on Tuesday, said that just having a medical marijuana card does not show “medical necessity.”</p>
<p>“Just having the card is not the equivalent of lawful use.”</p>
<p>Instead, Mr. Krandel argued that the Medical Marijuana Act does not provide sweeping immunity from prosecution.</p>
<p>“They’ve claimed the medical marijuana law has built an entire wall around their life, and courts cannot under any circumstances evaluate what’s going on with their health,” he said.</p>
<p>He argued that the courts should have discretion in how to oversee probation.</p>
<p>“The petitioners are on a path back to good citizenship -- courts are trying to get them rehabilitated.”</p>
<p>Justice Debra Todd asked Mr. Krandel if Lebanon County’s argument is stronger if the underlying crime in question relates to substance abuse.</p>
<p>“Is there a distinction in your mind between the type of crime that gave rise to probation and medical marijuana?” Justice Todd asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Krandel agreed that was part of the court’s consideration, as all three petitioners in the case have dealt with substance abuse in the past.</p>
<p>He emphasized Lebanon County’s policy allowing the probationer to ask for an exception, but Justice Christine Donohue countered that then places the burden on the probationer.</p>
<p>“Is that how the judicial district expects this to work?” she asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Krandel said he couldn’t answer that question because the policy has not yet been implemented, and he doesn’t know how the probation judges will interpret it.</p>
<p>But Justice Donohue wondered how the Lebanon County policy can withstand legal scrutiny if it is left up to the “unbridled discretion” of the probation judge, without spelling out, with specificity, what is required of the probationers.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that, on its face, enough to say the policy can’t stand?”</p>
