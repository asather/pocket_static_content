<h1>Jeff Banister discusses layoff, his love of the Pirates and what's next</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jeff Banister has been a consistent source of positivity throughout his three-plus decades in professional baseball, all but four years of them with the Pirates.</p>
<p>So, it should surprise no one that Banister is taking a glass-half-full approach to the fact that last week he was laid off from his job as a special assistant in baseball operations.</p>
<p>“I can link myself to Danny Murtaugh through Bill Virdon,” Banister said during a lengthy phone interview with the Post-Gazette on Monday. “When you think about that … or Chuck Tanner, Jim Leyland … for a guy who wouldn’t even have been drafted in this year’s draft and to think about where I ended up inside the organization, it’s been 31 years of being truly blessed.”</p>
<p>Banister touched on a variety of topics, including how he wasn’t given much of a shot to succeed Clint Hurdle and also that he’d like to continue doing something in pro ball.</p>
<p>But the biggest takeaway was that Banister, a 25th-round pick of the Pirates in 1986 who would eventually play and coach across several levels, will never stop loving this city or organization, even if the ending was a little abrupt.</p>
<p>Banister actually said he empathized with general manager Ben Cherington and president Travis Williams because he knows these are hard decisions to make, ones he saw occur with former manager Clint Hurdle and former general manager Neal Huntington.</p>
<p>“There’s no clean and easy way, right?” Banister said. “Everybody who’s been in a position to where you had to release somebody or let somebody go, it’s hard because you’re ending something that they love doing. When Ben and I talked, I understood that.</p>
<p>“Would I still love to be there? Absolutely. I’ve got dirt under my fingernails from old Pirate City, where the golf course is a city dump, McKechnie Field still had corrugated metal fences and wooden seats, and we had locker rooms with chicken wire and cement floors.&nbsp;I used to walk by Roberto Clemente’s room that they had sealed up. I put my hand on the door every day, asking The Great One just to give me a little bit of talent so I could stick around.”</p>
<p>Stick around Banister did, serving as a minor league manager and field coordinator and also an assistant coach at the major league level. The Pirates brought Banister back in January 2019 after he spent four years managing the Rangers, winning a pair of AL West titles.</p>
<p>For those reasons, many had Banister pegged as Hurdle’s successor should something happen. Banister seemingly did, too.</p>
<p>But after Huntington was fired, Banister said he knew his chances of managing in Pittsburgh were shot.</p>
<p>“When Ben got the job, he contacted me immediately and let me know he wasn’t going to interview me for the managerial job,” Banister said. “And I get that part of it. I knew when Neal was let go, a new GM coming in, my opportunity to manage the team was probably gone.</p>
<p>“It was disappointing because of the number of years and the people who had taught me along the way, the history of it all.”</p>
<p>Banister said he and Cherington had hoped to talk more and spend some time together. “Really learning what my skill set was for him and how I could help the organization.” Banister said.</p>
<p>But the with coronavirus pandemic delaying the season, it limited what Banister and Cherington could discuss. With with an eye toward the future and how Cherington would like to do things moving forward, the Pirates decided last week that it was better to go in a different direction, letting Banister and around 14 others go.</p>
<p>“I have no other feelings other than respect for Ben and Travis,” Banister said. “They’re tough decisions. They’ve probably been given some tough assignments, as well. I can only imagine what they’ve had to do through all of this.”</p>
<p>Earlier this spring, Banister said he did not go to spring training, the first time in 35 years that happened. “I wasn’t invited,” he said.</p>
<p>Instead, Banister focused on the positives. He actually got to watch his son, Jacob, play a few games of his senior high school baseball season before COVID-19 struck with full force. Jacob is headed to Northern Colorado in the fall.</p>
<p>“In retrospect, the way things have gone with COVID, it was almost a blessing that I didn’t go because I got to see him play more games than I’ve ever seen him play,” Banister said.</p>
<p>This summer will probably be similar, Banister said. It will likely be tough to get work now, and he’ll also be paid by the Pirates through October. But with the Pirates doing this now, Banister and others will have time to contact people throughout the game and perhaps line up work for next season.</p>
<p>That, Banister said, is very much appreciated.</p>
<p>“It caught me a little bit off guard that it happened when it did,” Banister said. “However, I’m also fortunate that it happened when it did.”</p>
<p>Banister that he still believes “there’s a lot of coach left in me,” perhaps even as a manager. He did, after all, interview to manage the Astros shortly before spring training started.</p>
<p>“Not done by any stretch,” Banister added. “Helping players get better, I enjoy that.”</p>
<p>But it won’t be in Pittsburgh, and Banister knows that, even if he seemingly made a case for the importance of his job with another one of his answers.</p>
<p>One that also touched on how much he loves Pirates fans and how it takes a unique perspective to understand this city’s relationship with its baseball team.</p>
<p>“The fanbase in Pittsburgh, the people and how they approach it, the love that they have for their teams, the connection that they have, it’s unlike any other,” Banister said. “And it’s necessary to understand what it really means to put that uniform on. You need people around those young men to help them understand just exactly what that is. To me, that’s experience.”</p>
<p>Banister will never forget some of the moments from his later years here. Like yelling at Hurdle in the dugout after Russell Martin’s second home run during the 2013 NL wild card game, the two of them inches apart and unable to hear a blessed thing.</p>
<p>“I still have tinnitus in my ears from how loud it was in that dugout,” Banister said.</p>
<p>Or the extra Stargell stars that Banister found recently while cleaning out his home office, something Banister — the longest-tenured man in a Pirates uniform at the time — was saving for a specific and special time when he started handing them out in 2013.</p>
<p>“I got to thinking about Willie, Chuck, and what it must have felt like in ’79. I just started handing out those stars. When I’m looking at ’em, I can still see [Francisco] Liriano’s expression.”</p>
<p>Banister also won’t forget his one and only at-bat — a pinch-hit single — at Three Rivers Stadium, the 20 consecutive losing seasons or landing at Sarasota-Bradenton Intentional Airport after he was drafted, carrying his own bags and calling home, hoping to make it another day.</p>
<p>“There’s so much,” Banister said. “Even answering when people would say, ‘Why do you keep giving us Pirates stuff at Christmas?’ I’d always say, ‘Because that’s my team.’ ”</p>
<p>The Pirates will seemingly always be Banister’s team. But outside of receiving his promised salary for four more months, they’re no longer his employer.</p>
<p>“I still believe there’s somebody out there that wants somebody with experience to come in and help,” Banister said. “I don’t have to sit at the head of the table. It’s never been that. I never went out and sought that title. Hopefully there’s another uniform, another staff, another organization that believes I have an opportunity to make an impact.”</p>
