<p>I am having a great deal of difficulty understanding the concern over the issue of “election mail delivery.” I cannot believe that the volume of mail created by the upcoming November election will be any greater than that created at Christmastime. We send between 30 and 40 Christmas cards at Christmas (some of them to Europe) and they all arrive on time. We also send packages, also delivered on time.</p>
<p>We represent just one family in America sending multiple USPS-delivered Christmas cards and packages, all of which are delivered before Christmas. The reason for this timely delivery is because there are numerous announcements in the newspaper and on television, along with notices displayed at the post office informing people that if they want their Christmas mailings delivered by Dec. 25, then they must be postmarked before a specific date.</p>
<p>The Postal Service merely needs to employ the same number of people for this election that it does at Christmas and inform the American public what the cutoff date is for the mail-in ballots to be received by the election offices in time to be counted as valid. If people are too lazy to follow those simple instructions, then their ballots do not deserve to be counted.</p>
