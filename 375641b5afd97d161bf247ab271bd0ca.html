<h1>Breaking down Pitt's depth chart ahead of Austin Peay opener</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pat Narduzzi stood at his podium Monday with a Pitt backdrop behind him, answering questions to kick off the first game week of the season. It looked normal ... but it didn’t <em>feel</em> familiar.</p>
<p>Typically, there would be reporters spread out through the team room. Instead, everyone was socially distanced via Zoom. And normally on the first day of the week, media members are handed a physical copy of the depth chart, which is pored over immediately. But on Monday, a PDF would have to do.</p>
<p>Pitt released its first two-deep of the season with its opener against Austin Peay days away. Kickoff is set for 4 p.m. Saturday at Heinz Field, with the game airing on ACC Network.</p>
<p>Let’s break down how the Panthers will look.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Quarterback</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Kenny Pickett</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Davis Beville or Joey Yellen</strong></p>
<p>Much like Week 1 last year, Pitt isn’t giving anything away about who would step in for Pickett if he missed time due to illness or injury.</p>
<p>We saw Nick Patti fill in last September, starting against Delaware while Pickett recovered from a shoulder injury. But that doesn’t necessarily mean Patti — who’s dealt with minor injury issues in camp — would be the guy again should something happen to No. 8.</p>
<p>Beville, a redshirt freshman, has made strides. And Yellen, an Arizona State transfer who enrolled in January, was granted immediate eligibility after his waiver was approved by the NCAA last month.</p>
<p>“It’s a work in progress, really,” Narduzzi said of the backup quarterback situation. “When you look at it, Joey’s come in and it’s a new thing. Davis has played outstanding. If you went around the room, I’m sure you’d have guys say both of them are the Number 2. So we’re going to find out when game time comes around and they get that opportunity.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Running back</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. A.J. Davis</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Todd Sibley Jr. or Vincent Davis or Daniel Carter or Israel Abanikanda</strong></p>
<p>It’s not uncommon to see a lot of the word “or” on Pitt’s depth chart. And while four of them seems excessive, it is the Pitt running back room we’re talking about here.</p>
<p>“There’s a group of tailbacks there that we’re going to find out who gets hot and who’s making plays. Then we’ll find out who our starter is,” Narduzzi said. “It’s going to be who shows up on game day. But I’ve got trust in every one of them.”</p>
<p>A.J. Davis, Vincent Davis and Sibley return after rushing for 530 yards, 314 yards and 249 yards in 2019. Carter, a redshirt freshman who saw limited time at fullback last year, went on a hot streak during training camp, Narduzzi added. Abanikanda, a true freshman, flashed in spring ball, as well.</p>
<p>Pitt will take any injection of life after the rushing attack was woeful in 2019. Pitt ranked 100th nationally in rushing attempts per game and 118th in rushing yards per game as the offense relied on Pickett’s arm to move the ball.</p>
<p>“Our run game’s got to be better,” Narduzzi said. “And we’re going to find out soon what we have and how much better we are than what we were a year ago.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Wide receiver</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Jordan Addison; Shocky Jacques-Louis; Taysir Mack or Jared Wayne</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. John Vardzel; Tre Tipton or DJ Turner</strong></p>
<p>The biggest surprise here isn’t that Addison, a true freshman, will start in the slot (and at kick and punt returner); that’s been known for a few weeks now. Rather, it’s interesting to see Mack and Wayne battling for the first-team spot at “Y” receiver on the outside.</p>
<p>Mack returns the most production for a Pitt wide receiver, and it’s not particularly close. The former Indiana transfer caught 63 passes for 736 yards last year. The next closest is Jacques-Louis, who logged 23 receptions for 348 yards. Wayne, meanwhile, chipped in 18 catches for 261 yards in eight games.</p>
<p>“There’s a battle every day. But that’s a good problem,” Narduzzi said of the “Y” position. “Jared and Taysir, it’s a one-two punch. Both those guys can go out there and get it done. We’re excited about them all. The way we like to throw it, it’s to have more than just one guy that you can rely on out there at ‘Y.’”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Tight end</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Lucas Krull</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Kyi Wright or Daniel Moraga</strong></p>
<p>This one’s pretty cut and dry. Krull transferred in from Florida to be an integral part of the offense, and he’ll see most of the work at tight end.</p>
<p>Wright, a redshirt freshman from Farrell, has done well in camp, and Moraga, a junior college transfer from California, could factor in. Former walk-on and Indiana Area product Jake Zilinskas is also expected to have a role.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Offensive line</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. LT: Carter Warren; LG: Bryce Hargrove; C: Jimmy Morrissey; RG: Jake Kradel; RT: Gabe Houy</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. LT: Carson Van Lynn; LG: Matt Goncalves; C: Owen Drexel; RG: Blake Zubovic; RT: Keldrick Wilson</strong></p>
<p>There wasn’t any doubt how Pitt would look on the left side of the line. Warren started all 13 games protecting Pickett’s blind side last year, and Hargrove was a third-team All-ACC selection next to him. But the right tackle spot was up for grabs this camp, and Houy won out.</p>
<p>Houy, a 6-foot-6, 300-pound redshirt junior, started the first six games of last season at right guard before alternating at tackle. He dealt with undisclosed injuries throughout the year, needed offseason surgery and showed up to spring camp with a cast on his right arm. But Houy is healthy now and beat Wilson, a grad transfer from Hampton, for the first-team gig.</p>
<p>Now Houy, an Upper St. Clair grad, just needs to hold down the spot next to Butler’s Kradel.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Defensive end</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Patrick Jones II; Rashad Weaver</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Deslin Alexandre or John Morgan; Habakkuk Baldonado</strong></p>
<p>No shockers here at Pitt’s deepest position on the roster.</p>
<p>A lot is expected of Jones and Weaver. The former could have left early for the 2020 NFL draft, but instead returned to play along Pitt’s nasty front-four. Weaver, meanwhile, is 100% healthy following his ACL tear last August. The redshirt senior, who led Pitt in sacks and tackles for loss in 2018, shouldn’t be slept on.</p>
<p>Alexandre, who stepped up after Weaver went down, had 5.5 sacks last year and would start on almost every other ACC defensive front. Baldonado (four sacks in 2019) and Morgan (four TFLs) are valuable edge rushers, as well.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Defensive tackle</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Keyshon Camp; Devin Danielson</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. David Green; Tyler Bentley or Calijah Kancey</strong></p>
<p>After Jaylen Twyman opted out to prepare for the 2021 draft, all the noise from Pitt’s South Side facility indicated Danielson would be next up. Sure enough, the former Thomas Jefferson standout — whom Warren called a “true leader” — will get his chance.</p>
<p>But so will Bentley and Kancey, who have garnered praise this camp. Bentley saw significant snaps as a backup last season, while Kancey, a redshirt freshman who played one game, was called “electric” by Narduzzi a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be like the running back position: Who’s making the plays and who’s getting it done when they’re out there?” Narduzzi said Monday of the hole left by Twyman. “I think we’ll know a lot more after this first game.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Linebacker</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>“Star”: 1. Cam Bright; 2. John Petrishen</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Mike”: 1. Wendell Davis; 2. Chase Pine; 3. Brandon George</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Money”: 1. Phil Campbell III; 2. SirVocea Dennis</strong></p>
<p>Bright and Campbell were locks at Pitt’s two outside linebacker positions, while Petrishen — a former Penn State safety recently put on scholarship — and Dennis, a redshirt freshman, were expected to back them up.</p>
<p>But the middle linebacker battle produced a surprise: Davis, a redshirt sophomore who’s made 10 tackles in 16 games at Pitt, beat out Pine, a fifth-year senior who’s started twice and played in 34 contests.</p>
<p>Narduzzi said Pine performed well in camp, but Davis blew him away.</p>
<p>“It’s called consistency,” the coach said. “He’s been steady. The guy hasn’t missed a practice, hasn’t missed a beat. He’s been sharp getting everyone lined up. Just consistent. He knows what’s going on. ... It’s been a battle there. But he’s been physical. And he just hasn’t stopped doing what he did the first day.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Cornerback</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Jason Pinnock; Marquis Williams</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Rashad Battle; A.J. Woods</strong></p>
<p>With senior Damarri Mathis sidelined for the season, his role and responsibilities fall to Williams, a 5-foot-8 redshirt sophomore who’s never started before.</p>
<p>Replacing Mathis will be no small task. A 10-game starter in 2019, Mathis allowed the second-lowest quarterback completion percentage in the ACC last year. He also logged two interceptions and 11 pass breakups, second-most on the team.</p>
<p>Woods, a redshirt freshman, will push Williams for time. So will “mentally sharp” true freshmen Battle and Jahvante Royal. But Narduzzi said Williams is “the guy” right now going into Pitt’s opener — and he’ll have to prove he belongs out there opposite Pinnock.</p>
<p>“What he’s done is be consistent,” Narduzzi added. “He knows the defense. He’s tackled really, really well. And he’s made plays on the ball, which is what we expect guys to do.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Safety</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Free: 1. Damar Hamlin; 2. Erick Hallett</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong: 1. Paris Ford; 2. Brandon Hill</strong></p>
<p>Like tight end and defensive end, no surprises here whatsoever.</p>
<p>Ford and Hamlin make one of the best safety duos in college football, if not the best. They’ll rarely come off the field this season.</p>
<p>When and if they do, Hallett and Hill provide fine cover. Hallett is a former cornerback who played a little nickel last season (and still might in 2020). Hill, meanwhile, has received praise by both Narduzzi and Hamlin this camp, with the latter comparing Hill to former Pitt star Jordan Whitehead.</p>
<p>“He’s explosive, he’s smart, and he’s a quick learner,” Hamlin said of Hill last week. “And athletically, he reminds me of Whitehead. I tell him that all the time. Speed-wise and how he just flies around and is so aggressive. ... Whenever he gets his chance on the field, y’all will see it for sure.”</p>
