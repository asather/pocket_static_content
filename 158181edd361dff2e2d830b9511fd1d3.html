<h1>State senators rip Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission decision to eliminate 500 toll collection jobs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Republicans and Democrats on two state Senate committees said Monday they will try to convince the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission to reverse <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/06/02/Pa-Turnpike-permanently-going-cashless-immediately-500-toll-collectors-losing-jobs-layoffs/stories/202006020113" target="_blank">its decision to lay off 500 workers involved in toll collection</a> this week.</p>
<p>Using terms like&nbsp;“astounding,” “extremely concerning” and “unconscionable,” members of the Transportation and Labor and Industry committees sharply criticized the agency for announcing the layoffs two weeks after signing a new contract with the union that represents the toll collectors as well as maintenance workers and office staff.</p>
<p>Those jobs were supposed to be eliminated at the end of 2021 as the turnpike switches to cashless tolling but the agency blamed financial losses during the COVID-19 pandemic and health concerns for eliminating plans to go back to toll collectors after the pandemic. Senators vowed to see whether federal stimulus money or other state money could be found to help pay the workers through next year, which would cost upwards of $100 million.</p>
<p>Committee members seemed particularly upset that the turnpike broke a five-year-old commitment to keep the jobs through next year and that they were never consulted or made aware of the pending layoffs before they were announced June 2.</p>
<p>“When is a promise really a promise?” asked Sen. Lisa Baker, R-Luzerne County. She and others noted that turnpike CEO Mark Compton had told union leaders in writing last fall and verbally after the pandemic started in March that the jobs would be maintained through next year.</p>
<p>Mr. Compton testified that his recommendation to switch to cashless tolling permanently and eliminate jobs was one of the toughest he has made at the agency. He said he regretted having to go back on his word to Teamsters officials but he believes financial losses of more than $100 million between March and May due to fewer drivers on the toll road and continuing social distancing requirements made switching now the turnpike’s best option.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see this coming,” Mr. Compton said.&nbsp;“I’m trying to keep the organization afloat. We had to make some tough decisions.”</p>
<p>Commission member William Lieberman, a former chairman, said the commission was aware of the commitment to maintain the jobs through next year. The pandemic’s financial impact on the agency&nbsp;caused it to break that commitment&nbsp;“for the overall health of the turnpike.”</p>
<p>“This pandemic overwhelmed us and no one is happy about it,” Mr. Lieberman said, adding the board&nbsp;“agonized” over the decision.&nbsp;“We made the best decision we could make with the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Mr. Compton and Chief Operating Officer Craig Shuey said consultants have told the turnpike that it could take four years for traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels. Mr. Shuey said the agency could lose $400 million in revenue in the fiscal year that began June 1.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to be out of the hole any time soon” he said.</p>
<p>Sen. James Brewster, D-McKeesport, said he would ask members of both committees to sign a letter to Gov. Tom Wolf and the turnpike commission asking them to reconsider the layoffs.</p>
<p>“This is just a bad decision at one of the worst times you could have picked,” Mr. Brewster said, referring to high unemployment rates as a result of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Union leaders also testified they were blindsided by the layoff decision and would have discussed other options if they had been given the opportunity. The union said it will file an unfair labor practice charge against the turnpike.</p>
