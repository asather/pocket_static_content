<h1>COVID-19 Update: Allegheny County cases top 7,000 with 22 new hospitalizations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the second time this week — and the fourth time this month —&nbsp;Pennsylvania has reported more than 1,000 new cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>State health officials on Friday reported 1,213 new cases, with Western Pennsylvania accounting for 365 of those. The statewide total is now 105,571.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allegheny County topped 7,000 total cases of COVID-19 on Friday and saw its highest single-day increase in hospitalizations — 22 patients —&nbsp;since the first confirmed case in mid-March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With an additional 198 new cases, Allegheny’s case total is now 7,015 cases. Hospitalizations now total 573 since March. Prior to Friday, the most recent, highest single-day increase in hospitalizations was July 17, with 17 hospitalizations reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Statewide, there were an additional 22 deaths, six of which were reported in Western Pennsylvania: two in both Allegheny and Lawrence counties and one each in Somerset and Westmoreland counties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The death toll in Allegheny County now stands at 221. The two new deaths were of a 54 and 89-year-old, who died on July 11 and July 22, respectively.&nbsp;The new state death toll now stands at 7,101.</p>
<p>The newly reported infections in Allegheny were diagnosed from 2,255 tests — more than 1,000 additional tests than Thursday — administered from July 6 through July 23, according to health officials.&nbsp;The new positive cases range in age from 9 to 93 years old, with the median age being 38.</p>
<p>Beaver County had the second-highest daily increase for Friday, with 31 new cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>State Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine noted on Thursday that every region in the state has counties that have seen an increase in the percentage of positive tests.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board also announced new guidelines for licensees that now correspond with the orders put into place last week by Gov. Tom Wolf. The orders require that alcoholic drinks must be purchased with a meal for on-site consumption. Additional drinks may be purchased, but once the meal is finished no further alcohol sales will be permitted.</p>
<p>Also, all bar service is prohibited, and customers must be seated at a table for food and alcohol consumption. In casinos, drinks service is no longer permitted on the casino floor.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the State Police Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement issued warnings to 13 Pittsburgh establishments for not following the newest COVID-19 guidelines. The enforcement agents checked on 601 establishments.</p>
<p>These warnings were given out to bars and restaurants that weren't following masking rules, capacity limits or adhering to social distancing, state officials said.&nbsp;The LCE did not release the names of the bars or restaurants that were given warnings.</p>
<p>The compliance checks are performed anywhere within the state, but are currently focused in higher virus transmission areas, according to state officials.</p>
