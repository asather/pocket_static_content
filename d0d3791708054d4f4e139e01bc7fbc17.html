<h1>Western Pa. accounts for 236 of state's nearly 1,000 cases of COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The number of new COVID-19 cases reported Thursday in Pennsylvania nearly topped 1,000, according to the state health department.</p>
<p>Of the 962 statewide cases,&nbsp;Western Pennsylvania accounts for 236 of them. Allegheny County had the highest total in the region with 147 new cases. Westmoreland County had the second highest with 20 cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the county reported its first case in March, it has a total of 6,817 cases.&nbsp;The state total is 104,358 cases.</p>
<p>Across the state, there was an increase of 16 new COVID-19-related deaths, bringing its total to 7,079.&nbsp;Western Pennsylvania reported three deaths — two in Allegheny County and one in Erie County.</p>
<p>During a press conference Thursday in Harrisburg, state Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine acknowledged that someone from the state administration had been on a call with Dr. Deborah Birx from the White House Coronavirus Task Force.</p>
<p>The call warned that certain cities, including Pittsburgh, needed to take “aggressive” mitigation efforts to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine added that efforts recommended by the White House were orders that Dr. Debra Bogen, Allegheny County’s health director, had already implemented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without being specific, Dr. Levine said, “the type of mitigation steps are exactly the steps Dr. Bogen put into place weeks ago."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allegheny’s new cases come from 1,172 tests that were administered within a 17-day span from July 6 through July 22. The cases range in age from 9 to 93 years old, with a median age of 38.</p>

<p>Of Allegheny County’s two deaths, one was 80 years old and the other was 87 years old. The deaths occurred on June 28 and July 22.</p>
<p>With 15 new hospitalizations, there have been 551 people hospitalized past or present in the county.</p>
<p>The state health department said the increased number of statewide cases can partially be attributed to a lag in reporting and included Philadelphia case counts from Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Thursday begins the first day that the county’s new COVID Field Response Team will be visiting businesses in the community to check for compliance with state and county guidelines. They expect the first checklists to be published sometime on Friday, according to a news release from the county.&nbsp;</p>
