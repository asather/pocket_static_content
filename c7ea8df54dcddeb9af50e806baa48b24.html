<h1>Steelers practice report: Some players sit during 'game-like' atmosphere at Heinz Field</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers would have been playing their second preseason game Sunday night at Heinz Field — a nationally televised game against the New Orleans Saints.</p>
<p>But because all preseason games have been canceled, coach Mike Tomlin used Saturday to simulate what an actual game day will be like for the Steelers, especially the young players. That included an evening practice with three live sessions.</p>
<p>“I thought it was important for us to simulate a game-like environment,” Tomlin said. “We approached it that way, with pre-practice work, stretch routines, all the things we would do in a preseason game. I don’t want it to be where we are in New York (for the season opener) and that’s the first time they are finding their rhythm.”</p>
<p>Tomlin cut practice short by 1½ periods, approximately 15 minutes, when lightning and thunder hovered over Heinz Field. The players were off the field by the time the heavy storm hit.</p>
<p>“You can’t win the Mother Nature battle,” Tomlin said. “We don’t combat lightning.”</p>
<p><strong>Players held out</strong></p>
<p>Tomlin said several players were held out of practice because of COVID-19-related issues, but he did not reveal which players. None of those players have been placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list as of yet, he said.</p>
<p>Not participating in practice were center Maurkice Pouncey, guard David DeCastro, running back James Conner, defensive end Stephon Tuitt, receiver Diontae Johnson and safety Terrell Edmunds. DeCastro, Conner and Edmunds were all at practice.</p>
<p>“There is a procedure and we want to make sure we adhere to the rules,” Tomlin said.</p>
<p>In addition to long snapper Kameron Canaday, who left practice after injuring his knee in a special-teams drill, three players left practice with injuries: defensive end Chris Wormley (shoulder), running back Wendell Smallwood (shoulder) and linebacker Robert Spillane (finger). Tomlin said he didn’t expect any of the injuries to be significant.</p>
<p><strong>Other developments</strong></p>
<p>• Running back&nbsp;Benny Snell and safety Minkah Fitzpatrick were jawing facemask-to-facemask after Snell tried to run through Fitzpatrick after a long gain. Fitzpatrick responded by throwing Snell to the ground.</p>
<p>• Tight end Zach Gentry made the niftiest catch of practice, picking a pass from Devlin Hodges off the lower back of linebacker Ulysees Gilbert III, who was facing Gentry.</p>
<p>• Canaday’s absence forced tight end Vance McDonald to handle the duties. Canaday didn’t return.</p>
<p>• After inside linebacker Devin Bush got stopped by tight end Kevin Rader in a back-on-backers drill, ending up in Rader’s arms, Tomlin yelled at Bush, “I know you’re a hugger, but damn.”</p>
<p>• JuJu Smith-Schuster made a nice diving catch at the end-zone sideline on a pass from Mason Rudolph. Ben Roethlisberger, standing nearby, signaled touchdown.</p>
<p><strong>Can you hear that?</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers used low-level, in-stadium background noise during the scrimmage sessions, something the NFL is looking to use during the regular season if fans are not allowed at games, according to team spokesman Burt Lauten.</p>
<p>The intention is to make up for the lack of real crowd noise in stadiums where fans aren’t allowed.</p>
<p>“I don’t care,” Tomlin said about the noise. “We have a hard core plan and we’re light on our feet. We can’t let changing variables affect us. Crowds, no crowds, artificial noise, music. All those things are subject to change. That’s something we’ve all got to learn to deal with.”</p>
