<h1>Pitt's 2021 recruiting class grows to 18 members with Utah tight end</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt nabbed yet another 2021 commit — but interestingly enough, not one who will be preparing for a senior season come the fall.</p>
<p>Trey Andersen — a 6-6, 250-pound tight end from Lehi, Utah — verbally committed to the Panthers on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Andersen was rated as a two-star prospect by Rivals.com and a three-star recruit by 247 Sports. Emphasis on the word <em>was</em>.</p>
<p>Andersen was previously committed to Brigham Young's 2019 recruiting class. But after graduating from Lehi High School, Andersen chose not to sign a national letter of intent with the Cougars and instead opted to serve a mission as a member of the Church of Latter Day Saints.</p>
<p>Back in April, Andersen was listed in a story by the Deseret News in Salt Lake City as a future BYU preferred walk-on serving in Fresno, Calif. However, Andersen — the son of former New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs offensive lineman Jason Andersen — received scholarship offers from Cal, Utah State and Pitt within the last couple of weeks and chose the Panthers.</p>
<p>Andersen, whose mission ends in November, intends on visiting Pitt when it's allowed and signing in December.</p>
<p>Pat Narduzzi has never signed a player from Utah before during his time at Pitt. Perhaps it'll be Andersen who changes Pitt's poor tight end track record.</p>
<p>In Narduzzi's tenure, the Panthers have signed six non-transfer tight ends. In the 2017 class, there were three: Tyler Sear, Charles Reeves and Grant Carrigan. Reeves transferred to Youngstown State in 2018, Sear left for Temple in 2019 and Carrigan moved to the offensive line this past spring.</p>
<p>In 2019, Pitt inked Jason Collier, who practiced at tackle throughout last season, and Kyi Wright, who still could find success. And last class, Pitt brought in Daniel Moraga, a junior college pass-catcher who hasn't had the chance to prove himself.</p>
<p>Pitt has also brought in graduate transfers each of the past four offseasons to stockpile the position, but it hasn't yielded positive results. At least, not yet.</p>
<p>Nathan Bossory left Air Force and finished his career at Pitt from 2015-17 as a special teams contributor. Chris Clark, a former four-star prospect, left UCLA in 2016 for Pitt only to step away from football in March 2018. Matt Flanagan transferred in from Rutgers in 2017 and had 17 receptions in his lone season with the Panthers. Meanwhile, Will Gragg and Nakia Griffin-Stewart, who joined Pitt from Arkansas and Rutgers in 2018 and 2019, respectively, combined for only 38 catches last year (and more than a few drops).</p>
<p>Maybe Florida grad transfer Lucas Krull, who certainly looked the part in a brief spring camp, can change those fortunes in 2020. And perhaps Andersen can keep a mini tight end revival at Pitt going in the seasons following.</p>
<p>For now, though, the only thing known for sure is that Pitt's 2021 class has continued to grow. The group is now up to 18 members, which, as of Andersen's commitment, ties Boston College and Louisville for the largest class in the ACC so far.</p>
<p>Now, No. 6 Clemson, No. 7 North Carolina, No. 10 Miami and No. 17 Louisville still top Pitt's No. 21 spot in the Rivals rankings. And the recruiting period is far from finished, with usual recruiting powerhouses like Auburn (No. 27, 10 commits), Texas A&amp;M (No. 28, 10 commits) and Oklahoma (No. 33, nine commits) biding their time for more heralded prospects.</p>
<p>But as it stands, Pitt's 2021 class is in good shape, with a chance to improve again soon.</p>
<p>Naquan Brown, a four-star outside linebacker from Virginia, <a href="https://twitter.com/quanbrown_4/status/1277997603179945984" target="_blank">stated on Twitter</a> that he'll be announcing his commitment on Wednesday evening. Brown is considering Pitt, along with five other schools: LSU, Penn State, Virginia Tech, Miami and Tennessee.</p>
