<h1>Federal judge schedules hearing on Teamsters contract fight with Post-Gazette  </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A federal judge said Thursday that he will hold an evidentiary hearing March 6 on a motion by the Teamsters union to hold the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in contempt for not honoring the judge's order blocking the paper from laying off employees and reducing the hours of others in violation of the union's contract.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan in November granted a request for a preliminary injunction filed by Teamsters Local 211, ordering that the company maintain the workers' status quo while contract negotiations continue. He reissued another order clarifying the injunction on Dec. 27.</p>
<p>Since then, the union has asked the judge for the reinstatement of 24 Teamsters who were terminated on Nov. 10 and 47 others who were reduced to part-time.</p>
<p>The judge indicated during a status conference Thursday that he was leaning toward holding the Post-Gazette in contempt and said he has broad authority to impose fines or even prison time, but he also said he needs to honor the company's right to due process.</p>
<p>The judge also ordered the parties into mediation with Jed Melnick of New York to try to reach a global resolution of all issues by the end of February.</p>
