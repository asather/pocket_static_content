<h1>3 Ohioans test positive for COVID-19 as DeWine announces emergency</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Three Ohioans, all in Cuyahoga County, have tested positive for the coronavirus, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Monday.</p>
<p>The individuals were notified Monday afternoon as the governor and his health director, Amy Acton, informed members of the media about the development.</p>
<p>All three are individuals are in their 50s, including one married couple who'd just returned from a cruise on the Nile and a third unrelated man who'd attended the recent American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in Washington. COVID-19 infections related to the conference had been previously identified elsewhere.</p>
<p>COVID-19, which began in China, has now killed more than two dozen people in the United States.</p>
<p>“This is certainly no ordinary time,” Mr. DeWine said. “It’s important for us to take aggressive action. The action we take will save lives.”</p>
<p>The governor made an appearance after an unrelated news conference at the Statehouse to release the new information.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine announced that he has signed a state of emergency to ease any red tape in purchased medical supplies and other items, although he stressed that the emergency itself should not cause alarm.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. Monday, he activated the state's Emergency Response Center to coordinate the state's efforts at fighting back against infections that Dr. Acton said they knew was coming.</p>
<p>The confirmed cases here come as Ohioans are preparing to vote in the presidential primary election March 17. The governor offered no advice to presidential candidates who have scheduled large rallies here on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said that 75 polling places that were supposed to be located at nursing homes in Ohio will be moved to other locations. He also said officials are considering what actions to take when it comes to polling locations at schools to protect students.</p>
<p>Dr. Acton referred to the illness as a “pandemic.”</p>
<p>“We as the State of Ohio are leaning in and taking an aggressive approach,” she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Acton said particular caution should be given to populations like individuals in nursing homes, who are more prone to the virus.</p>
<p>“We don't want you visiting your loved ones in a nursing home if you're sick,” she added.</p>
<p>The married couple in Cuyahoga County showed symptoms upon their return to Ohio after the Nile cruise and notified a health-care worker of their travel history. Health-care professionals will be in touch with those who have been in contact with all three Ohioans since their return to Ohio.</p>
<p>Just a few hours before Governor DeWine’s announcement, Lucas County health commissioner Eric Zgodzinski briefed reporters on preparations happening locally should a case be confirmed in northwest Ohio. Mr. Zgodzinski said he wasn’t aware of any individuals being tested in Lucas County but said some individuals from the county have been placed under “public health supervision” by the state, meaning they’ve been monitored for reasons such as travel to a location with confirmed coronavirus cases. These individuals did not exhibit symptoms of the virus. The state currently has 255 individuals across the state under public health supervision, 11 have been tested but received negative results and five other cases are being investigated.</p>
<p>Mr. Zgodzinski said the community should not panic, but people should be aware that the disease is mostly affecting senior populations and leaves some folks more prone to having complications.</p>
<p>“Be prepared, don’t be scared,” he said. “We’ve been talking about this for awhile.”</p>
<p>Spokesman Shannon Lands said the Toledo Lucas County Health Department has been “working closely” with elected officials, school superintendents, faith-based organizations, hospitals, the Toledo Chamber of Commerce, and first responders on educational components of the virus. Mr. Zgodzinski said he has stopped shaking hands for the time being, and cautions people to avoid any unnecessary travel.</p>
<p>“Just start thinking about how you would act if we do have issues,” he said. “It’s better now to get our behaviors in place than when we actually have an issue in our community. ...We’re not saying that you should stay home right now, but just take those extra precautions.”</p>
