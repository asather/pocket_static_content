<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>County officials Sunday evening called on all non-essential businesses in the county to close voluntarily to mitigate the spread of the deadly COVID-19 disease.</p>
<p>County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and county&nbsp;Health Director Debra Bogen, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONSxcY0kiqw&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video</a> statement, asked businesses to close for at least two weeks beginning Monday.</p>

<p>There are currently four confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the county.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is an unprecedented challenge that our community is facing,” Mr. Fitzgerald said in a statement. “This is an unprecedented time in our community. Our region has always been at its best when we work together, and this challenge is no exception.</p>
<p>“We need everyone to step up and play a part in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in our region. We understand that this may cause hardship for some, and frustration for others, but it’s imperative that we work together to do what’s best for our community.”</p>
<p>“Given the contagiousness of this virus, we know that it will not slow down on its own until it has infected most people in every community,” Dr. Bogen said. “The best hope we have for averting this catastrophic outcome is to take aggressive action to dramatically slow down the spread of the virus in our community.”</p>
