<h1>In North Carolina, ‘electability’ put to the test in Super Tuesday swing state</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CHARLOTTE — Voters in North Carolina headed to the ballot box on a rainy Tuesday to decide which Democratic presidential candidate should win the third-largest batch of delegates on the biggest primary election night of the year.</p>
<p>Although Tar Heel State voters hit the polls just three days after their neighbors to the south, they faced a scrambled race.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden, who <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/02/29/AP-Joe-Biden-wins-South-Carolina-primary/stories/202002290067?cid=search" target="_blank">won big in South Carolina on Saturday</a>, has since consolidated support from the moderate wing of the party. That includes endorsements from two former rivals — former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar — both of whom dropped out after failing to pick up any delegates in the South Carolina primary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s campaign has touted 1,500 endorsements from elected officials and other dignitaries across the country, including Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa. Mr. Casey’s campaign sent an email Monday seeking $15,000 to support Mr. Biden.</p>
<p>“I have worked closely with Joe on a range of issues important to the people of Pennsylvania,” Mr. Casey’s campaign email stated. “In order to accomplish the urgent task of defeating President [Donald] Trump, Democrats must win Pennsylvania. Joe can — and will — win Pennsylvania if he is the Democratic nominee for President.</p>
<p>The push to support Mr. Biden came amid the rise of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who holds a slim lead in total delegates after the first four state contests. Mr. Sanders is leading the polls in California and Texas, which have the most delegates up for grabs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Billionaire Mike Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who has built up a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/03/02/Mike-Bloomberg-campaign-Super-Tuesday-North-Carolina/stories/202003020035?cid=search" target="_blank">sleek campaign in North Carolina</a>, could be a wild card as he touts the endorsements of mayors in Charlotte and Raleigh. Mr. Bloomberg did not compete in the first four state contests, so Super Tuesday will be his debut on the ballot.</p>
<p>The polls have been trying to suss out the effect of those changes in North Carolina. Mr. Biden leads in the state in multiple polling averages. His lead is 13 percentage points, according to the most recent averages collected by RealClearPolitics.</p>
<p>And FiveThirtyEight’s averages — which showed Mr. Biden about even with Mr. Sanders at 22% support three days ago —&nbsp;on Tuesday showed Mr. Biden skyrocketing to 33% compared to Mr. Sanders’ 18%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In both of those polls, Mr. Bloomberg is in third place.</p>
<p>But a poll published Monday by High Point University showed a different picture. That poll had Mr. Sanders leading North Carolina with 31% support, with Mr. Bloomberg in second place with 18% and Mr. Biden in third place with 14%. High Point said it surveyed registered voters who self-identified as Democratic and unaffiliated voters who said they would participate in the Democratic primary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike the Republican primary, the states do not award delegates in a winner-take-all fashion. The Democratic primary doles out delegates proportionally to candidates who receive at least 15% of the popular vote total. That means if Mr. Biden is able to gain votes in California and Texas, he can gain delegates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amid the scrambling of the race, supporters of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren hope for a better showing. Ms. Warren sits near the bottom of the polls in North Carolina, though she has inched higher in recent days to 11%, according to the FiveThirtyEight averages.</p>
<p>“Most people, actually, who I’ve spoken with are undecided,” said Carrie Nelson, who joined more than a dozen people in the Warren campaign’s Charlotte office on Tuesday to call people on behalf of the candidate.</p>
<p>Ms. Nelson’s conversations with people surrounded the issue of “electability,” she said — that sense of&nbsp;“hand-wringing” over who is the best candidate to run against Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>She lamented that Ms. Warren has gotten lost in the debate among Democrats over Mr. Biden’s challenge to Mr. Sanders.</p>
<p>“Choosing a candidate based on what you think other people are going to do is dangerous,” Ms. Nelson said.&nbsp;“You need to vote for the person that you believe in most.”</p>
<p>None of the candidates is scheduled to appear in North Carolina, but Mr. Sanders’ local campaign office will throw a Super Tuesday watch party as the results from all 14 states roll in.</p>
