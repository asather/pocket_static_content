<h1>Ron Cook: Win over Ottawa gives Penguins a chance to feel good about themselves again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A lot of people wanted to bury the Penguins after their six-game losing streak. That was ridiculous. It’s a really long season. “I think every good team hits a rough patch once in a while,” Kris Letang said.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people want to believe the Penguins have solved their problems because they beat Ottawa, 7-3, Tuesday night at PPG Paints Arena. That is just as ridiculous. It was one game, at home, against a bad opponent. “You’ve got to start somewhere,” Sidney Crosby said. “We’ve got to look to build. It’s not going to happen overnight. We can’t get all the points back in one game.”</p>
<p>Two veterans.</p>
<p>Two team leaders.</p>
<p>Two experienced voices of reason.</p>
<p>What is true of the win is it gave the Penguins a chance to feel good about themselves again. They hadn’t won since catching Washington and taking over first place in the Metropolitan Division Feb. 18 by beating Toronto. This win was a long time coming.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to give the players credit,” Mike Sullivan said. “I think they were determined to get the result.”</p>
<p>The Penguins’ performance against Ottawa was different in just about every way from the six-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Different in all good ways.</p>
<p>Start with the seven goals. The touchdown was wonderful, especially after the Penguins scored a total of eight goals during the losing streak.</p>
<p>I think we felt like it was a matter of time for pucks to start going in,” Crosby said.</p>
<p>John Marino, back in the lineup for the first time since Feb. 6, put the Penguins on the board first with a wrist shot through traffic just 48 seconds in. The team never led in five of the six losses, the final three against Los Angeles, Anaheim and San Jose, three of the worst clubs in the NHL.</p>
<p>“We gave ourselves the lead, which was nice,” Crosby said. “Good way to start off the game. Good to see a couple go in.”</p>
<p>Conor Sheary and Bryan Rust scored goals to give the Penguins a 3-1 lead after one period. The team came in having scored just 51 first-period goals. Only five teams had scored fewer.</p>
<p>Sheary’s goal came after he went scoreless in three games since joining the Penguins in a trade Feb. 24. Rust, who added two goals in the third period for his third career hat trick, had just two goals in his previous 13 games.</p>
<p>Crosby finished with a goal and two assists and was a plus-three after scoring just one goal and playing as a minus-8 during the losing streak. His assist on Jason Zucker’s goal in the third period gave him 800 for his magnificent career. “That’s a nice number. It took long enough,” Crosby said with something of a smirk.</p>
<p>Rust’s first goal came on the power play. The Penguins went 1-for-18 on the power play during the losing streak. They hardly solved those problems, though. Their other four power plays produced nothing. They didn’t even get a shot during a four-minute high-sticking penalty on Ottawa center Chris Tierney in the second period.</p>
<p>The Penguins killed all four of the Senators’ power plays. That was a big improvement for a penalty kill that gave up five goals on 17 chances during the losing streak.</p>
<p>Matt Murray was good enough after giving up four, four and three goals in his three starts during the losing streak. He finished with 23 saves.</p>
<p>The defense, boosted by the return of Marino and Brian Dumoulin, back after missing 37 games, played a tighter game in front of Murray. Dumoulin was a plus-three. “They’re such good players on both sides of the puck,” Sullivan said of Marino and Dumoulin. “There are so many aspects of the game that they help us. It just makes us a better team when they’re in the lineup.”</p>
<p>Sullivan gave a lot of credit for the big night to Crosby, who took responsibility for the losing streak after the loss Saturday night at San Jose and pledged to be better. “I thought his performance was terrific. Any time a captain and a player of Sid’s caliber takes ownership like that, I think it inspires the rest of the group to want to play for him.”</p>
<p>It was the type of response by the Penguins that Crosby and Sullivan anticipated.</p>
<p>“I’m so happy for the players because I know how invested they are and how bad these guys want to win,” Sullivan said. “I’m pleased for them that they can feel good about their game. They’ve got something to show for their efforts. They’ve been playing hard. I have to believe that when you score seven goals in a game it has to give our guys a boost of confidence. It gives us something to build on. We’ll feel good about this one tonight (CQ) and go back to work tomorrow (CQ) and get ready for the next one.”</p>
<p>Yes, the next game.</p>
<p>The Penguins will play at Buffalo Thursday night against a Sabres team that has beaten them twice at PPG Paints Arena, 3-1 in the first game of the season and 5-2 Feb. 22.</p>
<p>The Penguins’ resurrection from the dead has only just begun.</p>
