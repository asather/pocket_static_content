<h1>Facing budget gaps, Pa. municipalities look to federal aid as lifeline </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Heading into 2020, John Dubnansky witnessed ribbon-cutting ceremonies nearly once a week in Johnstown, a simple gesture that reflected decades of hard work to escape the shadow of being labeled a “financially distressed” community.</p>
<p>Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, shuttering newly opened businesses and canceling the city’s premier summer event, “Thunder in the Valley,” which draws 10,000 motorcycle fanatics. The borough’s year-over-year tax revenues fell by $1.4 million in April and May, a steep drop for a city budget that totals $16 million annually.</p>
<p>“Just like any businesses, we as a municipal government have struggled as well,” Mr. Dubnansky, the city’s economic development director. “How do we ever recoup those costs?”</p>
<p>Johnstown and other struggling municipalities across the state have been lobbying for more federal aid to shore up lost tax revenue that one recent study estimates could run into the billions. A divided Congress faces growing pressure to reach a deal on a fourth major economic rescue package before many of the benefits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act expire at the end of July.</p>
<p>The limited funding for state and local governments was viewed by many Democrats and organizations representing local governments as a central shortcoming of the $2.3 trillion CARES Act passed in late March. That legislation included money for small businesses, direct cash payments to most Americans and dramatically expanded unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>The CARES Act established $150 billion for governments, including about $4.9 billion for Pennsylvania.&nbsp;But while 20% of the funding was made directly available to Pennsylvania’s seven counties with populations greater than 500,000, the rest was provided to the state to spend as it saw fit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After passing legislation to allocate $2.6 billion in CARES Act dollars, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/05/28/Pennsylvania-is-sitting-on-billions-in-coronavirus-relief-money-covid-19-CARES-act/stories/202005310032" target="_blank">state is still sitting</a> on more than $1.3 billion in aid three months after the CARES Act was passed. The state did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Dubnansky said smaller municipalities needed aid similar to that received by other groups, pointing out that governments have less flexibility to recover without layoffs and service cuts.&nbsp;In early April, the city received about $760,000 in community development block grant money that it decided to pass along to its businesses in the form of grants, in the hopes they could stay afloat through the crisis.</p>
<p>“We’re not like a business where a business can make more sales,” Mr. Dubnansky said. “Any future phase that doesn’t include money for municipal governments is going to be crippling for governments across the nation.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Bailouts’ and bankruptcy</strong></p>
<p>In Washington, Democrats have pledged to support more funding for municipalities.</p>
<p>Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, said municipalities in his district, like many businesses, are confronting steep losses through no fault of their own. Meanwhile, governments are placed on the front line of providing essential services through the pandemic.</p>
<p>“The administration has repeatedly said that state local governments bear the responsibility” of COVID-19 response, Mr. Lamb said, tasking governors and local health departments to buy personal protective equipment and perform testing. “You can’t give them all the responsibility and none of the tools to do the job.”</p>
<p>Republicans have expressed more skepticism — and outright opposition — of providing money to local governments, framing the aid as bailout for local officials who made bad decisions before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in April he would oppose the idea in any future legislation, suggesting governments should go the route of declaring bankruptcy instead of seeking federal funding.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said the senator believes Congress needs more time to assess the impact of the CARES Act funding, noting large investments in health care, transit authorities and school districts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Before we spend several hundred billion dollars of additional borrowed money, Senator Toomey believes we should determine what specific remaining needs there are,” the spokesman, Steve Kelly, said in a statement last week.</p>
<p>Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters, has said he would consider additional “targeted” funding, but added, “we should not be bailing out governors for implementing draconian, punitive lockdowns like the one we saw in Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>And Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, said governors could not be completely trusted to pass along federal dollars to municipalities that need them most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There needs to be a lot of public oversight on how those dollars do get put into use,”&nbsp;said Mr. Kelly, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Congress’ chief tax-writing panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The federal government should wait to send more hardworking taxpayer dollars to Governor Wolf until after what has already been provided is distributed and its effectiveness can be evaluated,” Mr. Kelly said last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May, Rep. Scott Perry, R-York, joined the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council to urge Congress to reject “attempts to bail out states for irresponsible policymaking made long before COVID-19.”</p>
<p><strong>Stuck in the mud</strong></p>
<p>Recent studies have revealed a dire situation for the state’s nearly 2,500 municipalities.</p>
<p>An analysis earlier this month by the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Metropolitan Studies estimated Pennsylvania’s municipalities could lose between $833 million and $3.4 billion in revenues, depending on the severity and length of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>“[H]undreds [of municipalities] are at risk of cash insolvency over the next two years due to the COVID-19 shutdown,” researchers noted in a press release accompanying the study from George Dougherty, an assistant professor in Pitt’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, and the Municipal Finance Research Collaborative.</p>
<p>“This is a revenue crisis brought on by the pandemic response rather than an expenditure crisis," Mr. Dougherty said in a statement.</p>
<p>The crisis could send far more Pennsylvania communities into the state’s Act 47 program than ever before, said professor David Miller, the center’s director, in a statement accompanying the study.</p>
<p>In Harrisburg, state House members unanimously passed a bill last week to allow local governments additional time to borrow via tax anticipation notes. The bill cleared the House unanimously.</p>
<p>Because the full economic impacts of the pandemic are ongoing and aren’t yet fully clear, the full budgetary impact won’t be known for some time, Mr. Dougherty said.</p>
<p>“We know it’s coming, we know it’s going to be bad,” he said.</p>
<p>Rick Schuettler, executive director of the Pennsylvania Municipal League, said many local governments are going to be faced with a choice between whether to raise property taxes or cut the services that are needed most, like police and fire departments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The league’s parent organization, the National League of Cities, projected cities face a $360 billion shortfall over the next three years, with Pennsylvania topping its list of states with hard-hit municipalities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington so far has failed to respond to the magnitude of the crisis, Mr. Schuettler said. The community block grant money — like the $760,000 that went to Johnstown —&nbsp;is helpful, he said, but it doesn’t fill holes in the general fund.</p>
<p>“They’re stuck. Their feet are in the mud,” he said.&nbsp;“There’s not going to be a recovery in Pennsylvania if we don’t allow municipalities to recover, too.”</p>
