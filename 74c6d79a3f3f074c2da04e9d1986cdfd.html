<h1>Levin Furniture to open 17 locations in Pittsburgh and Cleveland</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After a monthslong saga, Levin’s is officially coming back.</p>
<p>The furniture and mattress store chain announced Thursday it plans to open 17 locations in the Pittsburgh and Cleveland markets starting on Friday.</p>
<p>That’s fewer than the 33 stores Levin’s sold to Art Van Furniture LLC in 2017 —&nbsp;the beginning of what would become a tumultuous back-and-forth exchange between the two owners —&nbsp;but chairman Robert Levin said it was still cause for celebration.</p>
<p>“Finally, we’re back!,” he said in a prepared statement Thursday. “We are excited to bring back a century of high standards and caring for the communities we serve.”</p>
<p>Mr. Levin’s grandparents, Sam and Jessie, started the store in 1920. In 2017, after 25 years of running the business, Mr. Levin sold to Michigan-based Art Van.</p>
<p>Then, in March 2020, he announced he was going to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/03/05/Levin-Furniture-Levin-s-Robert-Art-Van-private-equity-bankruptcy-employees/stories/202003040053" target="_blank">reacquire the company.</a> At the same time, Art Van was preparing to file for bankruptcy and planning to liquidate the stores.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted business, the future of the deal became uncertain and Art Van moved to close the stores immediately, taking 1,200 jobs with them.</p>
<p>In May, Mr. Levin announced the two sides had reached an agreement and his <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/05/19/Levin-bankruptcy-Art-Van-reacquire-furniture-stores/stories/202005190124" target="_blank">furniture store was coming back.</a>&nbsp;“It shows that if you really want to do something, you make it happen,” he told the Post-Gazette at the time.</p>
<p>Mr. Levin will serve as chairman of the board for the company that bears his family name, with Erie-based furniture executives and brothers Matt and John Schultz as co-CEOs.</p>
<p>Of the locations the company is opening, nine will be furniture stores and eight will be mattress stores. Nine locations are in Pittsburgh, and eight are in Cleveland.</p>
<p>Furniture store locations in the Pittsburgh region will be in Monroeville, Wexford, Pleasant Hills and Greensburg, while mattress store sites will be in Cranberry, Mt. Lebanon, Robinson, Shadyside and in Washington, Pa.</p>
<p>The company would like to open as many of the original stores as possible but could not secure leases on all the former locations, according to a press release. Additional stores may open and some could be under another buyer and name in other markets, the release stated.</p>
<p>Levin Furniture has hired 375 former associates and is looking to hire for more positions.</p>
