<p>Penn State University confirmed on Tuesday its first case of COVID-19 at its University Park campus.</p>
<p>An alert was sent to students and faculty and a statement was posted on the university’s website about the case of the novel coronavirus Tuesday, but no further information about the affected person was made available.</p>
<p>“University Health Services have protocols in place for identifying, testing and isolating potential cases and Environmental Health and Safety will take necessary action on campus property consistent with established health and safety practices,” the statement said. “The well-being of our community is our first priority.”</p>

<p>The statement also notes that due to Penn State canceling face-to-face instruction on March 11, the “great majority” of students and faculty are learning and working remotely.</p>
<p>The case also comes after Penn State postponed on March 18 all spring commencement ceremonies.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of our community is of the utmost importance, and we implore all to follow the latest prevention guidelines that have been published widely,” the statement said.</p>
