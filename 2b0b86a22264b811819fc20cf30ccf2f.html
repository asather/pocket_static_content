<h1>Tony Norman: What would Nero do?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If there was ever the slightest doubt about President Donald J. Trump’s unfitness for the office he occupies, his sociopathic behavior over the past week should put all such doubts to rest.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump began last week disgracing himself during the first of three scheduled presidential debates against his Democratic opponent Joe Biden by cosplaying one of his own paranoid Twitter threads.</p>
<p>During his tirade, Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Biden’s proclivity for wearing masks in public, taunted Hunter Biden’s struggle with drugs and lied without ceasing about everything else.</p>
<p>He interrupted both his opponent and the moderator so many times that it forced rule changes to prevent it from ever happening again. True to form, Mr. Trump said he would not abide by any rule changes and claimed “victory” in the debate despite the overwhelming consensus that he lost badly and humiliated himself in front of the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s bad behavior was presaged by his family’s refusal to wear masks during the debate despite polite requests by the Cleveland Clinic, the host for the event, to do so. The Trumps, as always, do what they want whether the rules allow it or not. Rules are for suckers and losers.</p>
<p>Instead of immediately expelling the tax cheats and arrogant grifters from the hall for noncompliance with public safety guidelines, one of the nation’s most prestigious medical institutions enabled a tribe of diseased super-spreaders to continue its willful defiance of science in front of the world.</p>
<p>When Mr. Trump looked out over the debate stage on Tuesday and saw his family openly flouting the rules in the front row, no wonder he thought he would get away with what he planned to do. Despite such an abnormal expression of privilege during a pandemic, it was business as usual for the Trump clan.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday, the wheels began to fall off the Trumps’ crash-test dummy car when Hope Hicks, the first-among-equals of Mr. Trump’s special assistants, was diagnosed with COVID-19. The virus, which has already killed more than 210,000 Americans on Mr. Trump’s watch, had reached deep into the president’s inner circle.</p>
<p>It seemed that a different Trump sycophant was getting his or her number punched by the virus every few hours. The largely mask-less White House soiree for Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court the previous weekend turned out to be a super-spreader event that infected key players in the White House and the Republican high command. It was the Darwin Awards on steroids.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the president demonstrated his usual brutal disregard for every human who isn’t him by insisting on going to a Thursday fundraiser at his New Jersey golf resort despite strong circumstantial indications that he was also infected with COVID-19 given his daily working proximity to Ms. Hicks.</p>
<p>So Mr. Trump pressed-the-flesh with rich people of various ages and co-morbidities who consider the wearing of masks gauche and too much of a concession to society. The rules, after all, are for the small folk and other assorted socialists.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump hauled away a lot of money while likely infecting many. In much of the world, that would be called karma. In America, it’s what stupid rich people do to “own the libs.” They don’t care if Donald Trump is the reincarnation of Typhoid Mary herself, just as long as he continues giving them what they want once the rabble settle down.</p>
<p>Early Friday morning, the world learned that the president and first lady Melania Trump had COVID-19, the most anticlimactic yet shocking news in a year of shocking news. Of course, an administration whose first instinct is always to lie began lying about everything immediately. Mr. Trump was airlifted to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center out of “an abundance of caution” for a “mild case” of the coronavirus. The doctors put him on oxygen at one point and dosed him with every experimental drug available. No big deal. No reason to cede control to his eager-beaver vice president for even a second.</p>
<p>Of course, his personal physician lied about his condition to keep America “upbeat.” Mr. Trump discovered a long time ago that he is a master at manipulating those who are far smarter than he is. He doesn’t allow anyone who can’t be corrupted to hang around for too long.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump considers every day that he’s convalescing in a hospital and not spreading COVID-19 to the White House staff, his rich supporters, his congressional allies and his adoring mobs a tacit admission of weakness. He began lobbying for a return to the White House after a few days despite being a public health menace.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his latest Supreme Court pick may not have the votes to get confirmed before Election Day since key members of the GOP-controlled Senate are under quarantine.</p>
<p>In a series of manic tweets, Mr. Trump claimed that he “got it” about COVID-19, but he continued to downplay its seriousness. On Sunday, he forced two Secret Service agents to take him for a victory lap in a black Chevy Suburban to assure his dozens of mask-less fans holding a vigil in front of the medical center that he wasn’t very sick at all.</p>
<p>It was a stunt on the same moral level of what he did a few months ago in the clearing of Lafayette Park to make possible a photo op in front of a historic church to demonstrate his piety.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, who may be the nation’s biggest elected tax cheat, is so disconnected from the very concept of morality that it never occurred to him how grotesque making a taxpayer-funded joyride funded by the blood and misery of more than 210,000 Americans would look to those outside of the nattering know nothingness of Cult-45.</p>
<p>Of course, the two agents pressed into service for the stunt now have to be quarantined for 14 days while our very narcissistic president insists on returning to the White House. There is still much damage to be inflicted on America before the White House is thoroughly fumigated and sterilized for the incoming Biden administration in 2021.</p>
<p>Like a COVID-19 stricken Gen. Douglas MacArthur vowing to return to the Philippines, Mr. Trump vowed to return to the scene of so many crimes over the past four years by the end of the day on Monday. As usual, he will ask himself two questions as he embarks on his next action: What would Nero do? How would Caligula make the best of this situation?</p>
<p>Even as it continues its own version of the Bataan Death March as more of its members report coronavirus infections, the Republicans have dutifully fallen in line parroting Mr. Trump’s fantasies. They are committed to following him off the proverbial cliff on Election Day.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has run out of stunts to perform at the hospital. How many blank pieces of paper can he sign in one day? He needs the mask-less crowds at his far-flung rallies to affirm his existence. He needs the adulation that comes with the self-hatred capable of filling so many seats in the middle of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Donald Trump doesn’t care about how many people will die in the long march to a second term. If his supporters have chosen an ethic of “live free or die” no matter what, who is he to take that right away from what most other Americans consider the lunatic fringe?</p>
<p>Most Americans recognize his malignant narcissism for what it is, but Trump supporters see it as supreme confidence. What most see as sociopathic behavior by a president who has no regard for other human beings, they see 4-dimensional chess, the rules of which they don’t understand. And why should they care about the rules of 4-dimensional chess when Donald J. Trump can play the game for them?</p>
