<h1>Paul Zeise's maibag: Is Ben Roethlisberger really back, or was Monday a mirage?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> What did you think of Ben Roethlisberger Monday night? He looked a lot more sharp than I thought he would after all that time off. Do you think it will last?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I saw a lot of really good throws from Roethlisberger. I think there is no question his arm is strong enough and after some early throws that were off, he seemed to find his touch and accuracy. He made a really nice touch pass for a touchdown to JuJu Smith-Schuster. He definitely looked good and if he stays healthy, I have no reason to believe he won’t be able to make the throws all season long. But he has to stay healthy and there is no way to know if that will happen until the season plays out. He is back, and for his sake, let’s hope he is back for the whole season.</p>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Was the Steelers dominance of the Giants offensive line Monday a product of the Steelers or the Giants? In other words, is the Steelers defensive front 7 that good or is the Giants offensive line that bad?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I think a lot of both.The Giants offensive line is not very good. That has been an issue for them and I would expect it will continue to be an issue for them. The Steelers defensive line is dominant, though, and those two outside linebackers are a menace to society, or at least to opposing offenses. If the Steelers get that version of Bud Dupree every week, they are going to be a real problem and pain to deal with. The combination of a bad offensive line going against a great defensive front usually results in a game like Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Jereamy:</strong> Why can’t sports just be about sports? Why do the Steelers feel the need to put the name of Antwon Rose on their helmets? What purpose does that serve? It is a tragedy but the Steelers shouldn’t be in the business of making choices about what victim to honor, just play the games.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> It is a time and place right now where athletes are trying to find their social justice voice. They are using their platforms and there isn’t much you can do about it, other than just settle in and try to listen to what they are saying. I don’t think putting Rose’s names on the back of their helmets was a good decision, but I understand it and it isn’t something that bothers me. I just think there are more worthy victims of police violence to honor. The Steelers made their decision and that’s fine. I respect it. We are never going back to sports just being sports, so get used to it or stop watching.</p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong> Now that the Steelers have signed Cam Heyward, how are the going to afford anyone else for next season? They have a $40 million cap hit for Ben Roethlisberger and there is talk the cap could be $30 million less next year because of revenues falling. The Steelers are going to have to get rid of some good players, I fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> That is a great question, but as I have said many times, the Steelers always figure it out. And I would be willing to bet the league will work with the players’ association to come up with some exceptions or changes in the way contracts are counted toward the cap, seeing as it is such a different year and the cap could change so much. The Steelers have been masters at working the salary cap in their favor.</p>
<p><strong>Edwin:</strong> The Pirates could end with the worst winning percentage in team history. In 1952 they had a .278 winning percentage and this team has been hovering around .320. If they finish with a winning percentage lower than 1952, would they be the worst Pirates team of all time? It is a hard question because they are only playing 60 games.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I believe if this team played 162 games, they would win about 40 games and that would make them the worst of all time. This team should be happy it is a short season because it will be spared that embarrassment. This is an awful pitching staff right now and 162 games would expose that even more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Is Ke’Bryan Hayes the real deal or is he going to be another one-hit wonder like Bryan Reynolds? And what is up with Trevor Williams?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I would be careful to label Bryan Reynolds a bust or a one-hit wonder. He is a young player who has upside and I do believe he is a good baseball player. I would give him another year or two before I decide what he is. As for Hayes, there is no reason he can’t be a star. He has all the tools, he has the drive, he has the pedigree, he has the glove — it is all out there for him. He is a really talented player who now needs to mature into a really good player. I like what I’ve seen so far, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nick:</strong> Now that we are getting down to the end, who do you like to win the NBA and NHL titles?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Both tournaments have been fun. At the start I picked the Boston Bruins and the Lakers. I obviously did not know the Bruins goalie was going to walk out in the middle of it all. I would say now that I will stick with the Lakers and will go with the Lightning. The Lakers have the best player left in that tournament and Tampa has the best goalie left in that tournament.</p>
