<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police on Thursday arrested a man with homicide in connection to a fatal shooting in Homewood last week.</p>
<p>Authorities said Darryn Hobson, 20, of the South Side was responsible for an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/04/22/Police-investigating-Homewood-shooting-injuries-Bennett-Street/stories/202004220141" target="_blank">April 22 shooting</a> that left one man dead and wounded another person.</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint, Mr. Hobson was in a silver Mercedes Benz when he pulled up next to the victims, who were parked in an SUV on the 7300 block of Bennett Street around 8:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Mr. Hobson then fired three rounds through the rear passenger side window and into the SUV — shooting two of the three people inside — and drove away, the complaint says.</p>
<p>The driver of the victims’ SUV was taken to Allegheny General Hospital in critical condition. Police said he died from his injuries April 26.</p>
<p>Later that day, authorities identified Mr. Hobson’s vehicle using city cameras and spotted it later that day at the Olympia Shopping Center in McKeesport. He was taken into custody on an outstanding warrant from Allegheny County Police.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, when investigators asked Mr. Hobson if he had been in Homewood, he said,&nbsp;“I don’t hang around people like that.” Mr. Hobson also said that he did not lend his car to people.</p>
<p>When police pressed him on those subjects, he reportedly stated that he did not want to talk about being in Homewood and he did not want to talk about lending his car, the complaint reads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Hobson was charged with criminal homicide, carrying a firearm without a license, three counts of aggravated assault and two counts of recklessly endangering another person.</p>
<p>A second, unidentified person, referred to as Actor #2, was seen by the victims earlier that day when they were outside a convenience store. Police said Mr. Hobson and Actor #2 conspired together to plan the shooting.</p>
