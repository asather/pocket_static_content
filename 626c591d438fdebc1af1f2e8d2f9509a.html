<h1>Paul Zeise: Is Jim Rutherford’s faith in Penguins' aging stars misguided?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jim Rutherford did what he does best Tuesday, wheeling and dealing to try to make the Penguins better. He promised he would fix whatever was ailing the team, and he took his first step when he traded a first-round draft pick and some prospects to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/08/25/kasperi-kapanen-trade-penguins-maple-leafs/stories/202008250091" target="_blank">Toronto for Kasperi Kapanen</a>.</p>
<p>If this trade is any indication, it is clear that Rutherford does not think the Penguins’ window to win another Stanley Cup with a team built around Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang has closed. He clearly has a lot of faith in the trio and some of the players remaining from the teams that won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>It’s easy to understand why he isn’t ready to break it up. But despite all of their success in the past, there’s no evidence to suggest this window is still open. In fact, recent history suggests it’s time to move on and begin the process of rebuilding.</p>
<p>Kapanen is a good young player — 24 years old — and was a first-round pick, so I have no issue with Rutherford trading a first-round pick for him. He will be a better player over the next three seasons, if not longer, than whoever the Penguins would have drafted with the No. 15 pick in this draft.</p>
<p>That is a good start, but&nbsp;Rutherford needs to look at what this team really is or at least has been recently. Two seasons ago, the Penguins were eliminated by the Washington Capitals on their way to the Stanley Cup.&nbsp;Last season, they looked lifeless and a bit slow as they were swept by the Islanders. And we all know what happened in the qualifying round against Montreal a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>If I were general manager, I would deal players such as Letang and Malkin, and any other veteran of value that has a big contract. My goal wouldn’t be to tear it all down, and the team still would be built around Crosby, but I would try to cash in my aging stars for packages of younger players.</p>
<p>Rutherford didn’t do that, though, and I can’t blame him. He thinks there’s maybe one more run in the group and he owes it to them to give them one more shot. He then doubled down at the trade deadline and added some key pieces to try to make another run, and the result was that embarrassing loss to the Canadiens.&nbsp;The Penguins not only looked slow, but they looked a bit disinterested.</p>
<p>That should be the final straw for this core group.&nbsp;The Penguins were once a feared matchup for opponents. They aren’t anymore, and the fact that they are 1-9 in their last 10 playoff games speaks volumes to that. They no longer strike fear in the hearts of anyone as many teams have passed them by and have done so with younger, faster and hungrier players.</p>
<p>Every great team eventually succumbs to Father Time.&nbsp;Rutherford needs to embrace this and think about moving some of the veterans stars on the Penguins and replenish their young talent base.</p>
