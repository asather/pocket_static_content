<h1>Presidents' Athletic Conference delays most fall sports until spring 2021</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Presidents’ Athletic Conference — home to numerous NCAA Division III schools throughout Western Pennsylvania —&nbsp;has joined the list of athletic leagues delaying most fall sports seasons until spring 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The conference announced Friday that its presidents’ council voted unanimously to delay competition in high- and medium-contact sports such as football, men’s and women’s soccer, women’s volleyball and men’s and women’s cross country.&nbsp;The league had previously announced July 7 that all of its teams would participate in league-only schedules this fall.</p>
<p>“We wrestled long and hard before deciding to postpone competition … a difficult disruption for our student-athletes and coaches,” Dr. Calvin Troup, president of Geneva College and chair of the PAC Presidents’ Council, said in a news release. “That said, we remain hopeful that conditions will permit us to include these sports safely in an expanded PAC athletic schedule this coming spring.”</p>
<p>Seasons in low-contact sports including women’s tennis and men’s and women’s golf will proceed with conference-only schedules.&nbsp;Other low-contact spring sports may also be moved up to the fall. The conference is currently evaluating the logistics of such a move.</p>
<p>Additionally, no winter sports seasons will begin before Jan. 1, 2021.</p>
<p>“I cannot stress this point enough: This is a postponement of certain fall sports competitions,” PAC commissioner Joe Onderko said in the news release. “Our presidents’ council has indicated every intention of having our schools play football, soccer, volleyball and cross country league schedules to the greatest degree possible during the spring 2021 semester, with a continued highest priority on student-athlete health and safety.”</p>
<p>“We remain extremely hopeful that improved, more available and more cost-effective testing procedures for COVID-19, if not an outright vaccine, will make spring competitions in these high-impact sports a much more viable option than in the fall. Moving all winter sports competitions until after Jan. 1 also gives us a greater degree of confidence in both starting and finishing those seasons.”</p>
<p>Conference members include Bethany, Chatham, Franciscan, Geneva, Grove City, Saint Vincent, Thiel, Washington &amp; Jefferson, Waynesburg and Westminster.&nbsp;</p>
