What is more likely - a tag of some sort or a long-term extension. How does this affect the pending extension of TJ Watt in the coming season or two? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It doesn't and won't affect what happens with Watt. He will get a monster contract from the Steelers, probably before the start of next season. It is more likely Dupree will get a franchise or transition tag</p><p><strong>Rico412</strong>: Will they make effort to extend Juju this offseason or wait to see how he performs next year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Probably not. Their first priority will be to extend Watt</p><p><strong>Rico412</strong>: When will it be determined if Steelers get 3rd round compensatory pick for Lev Bell signing? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not until the start of free agency</p><p><strong>Steelcard36</strong>: Good day sir. I just can’t see it being advisable for Ben, if healthy enough, to throw the ball 30-40 times a game next year. I think we need to get back to the old formula of run the ball and stop the run. Do you believe we have the pieces needed to operate under such a premise? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. The best piece they have is No. 7 and this team is built around that. It is Ok to supplement that with the run, and in some circumstances, run more than you throw. But their success has been built around Ben since 2004 and that's the way it should be. To think anything else is foolish.</p><p><strong>Rico412</strong>: What would a QB coach offer that current coaching staff can’t already do? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ben doesn't need a QB coach. The other young guys do. To me, hire a QB coach. You always had one before, even when you had veterans Batch and Leftwich as backups.</p><p><strong>Stlrdave1</strong>: Happy New Year Gerry. Do you know if any other QB in recent history has had the same type of surgery as Ben? I know Coach Tomlin indicated the organization will know more Feb. 1. I'm thinking they will sign a veteran backup. And keep up the great work, always appreciate your insight. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yeah...Bradshaw</p><p><strong>bay</strong>: Good Morning, Mr Dulac the jets made it clear that they will take calls on Lev Bell do you think it's a good idea to send the third round comp pick to the jets in return for Lev Bell we do need a running back <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: First off, I think the Jets would want more than a third-round comp pick for Bell. And I'm not sure the Steelers would want to go backward and do that anyway. Also, as to a previous question, comp picks are awarded around the time of the NFL owners meetings in March, not at the start of free agency.</p><p><strong>marty v</strong>: McDonald can't stay healthy, are there any big name TE's available in free agency this year? What's your opinion of 88 and 81? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: My opinion is they need to draft a tight end by the fourth round or sign one in free agency. A No. 2 TE, for sure, is needed.</p><p><strong>Joe Joe</strong>: If the OL is indeed restructured to improve run blocking, do you think Bennie Snell Football can be the Steelers’ feature back, using white as their change of pace and Connor/Samuels as checkdowns out of the backfield? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, he is not a feature back. He is a very good complementary back, however. He can only run inside the tackles.</p><p><strong>Craig</strong>: Do you think the Steelers will put the franchise tag on Bud? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I do.</p><p><strong>Jerry</strong>: With Ben having major elbow surgery. It’s not a given that he will be the same Ben. With that being said what veteran QB out there would you sign if it was up to you? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I haven't seen the entire list but a guy like Marcus Mariota would be perfect. However, I think his price tag will run a little high</p><p><strong>Kevin Colbert</strong>: I'm planning to cut McDonald, Foster, Chickillo and Barron this off-season to free up a quick 20 Mil to franchise DuPree. Do you agree? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Foster, Chickillo, Burns for sure</p><p><strong>Boswell</strong>: Will the Steelers special teams coach and punter finally be dismissed? Same errors, year after year. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I wouldn't hold your breath</p><p><strong>Tommy</strong>: How come we're just now hearing about the seriousness of Rudolph injury? An aorta issue is nothing to gloss over. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Because Rudolph just told me about it the first time he was back in the locker room. Also, in case you didn't know, teams and players are not required to tell you or anyone else about their health issues, if they choose not to. There are laws governing that.</p><p><strong>Mary</strong>: The decision making by Hodges is just not there. The strip sack killed the Steelers late in the 2nd. Is that something that ever gets better? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: For what you described, no. But give him a break, he's an undrafted rookie doing more than anyone imagined.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: If Foster gets released does Pitt sign Finney or move Feiler inside to guard and Chuks to tackle? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's always an option.</p><p><strong>Lauren</strong>: Edmunds did not improve at all in year 2 and still has no field awareness. Thoughts on re-signing Davis and moving him to that spot? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Davis will not be re-signed.</p><p><strong>VAsteelersFan</strong>: Hi Gerry, was there a reason MT didn't challenge the Diontae Johnson would-be TD in the last game? Did I miss something? Please tell me the Rooneys are forcing him to keep a second pair of eyes up in the booth now. Thanks <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I never saw the replay clear enough to say for sure. I know others have suggested he should have. I'm sure they will keep the same setup in 2020 that they had this year.</p><p><strong>Courtney</strong>: Will Lynch get invited to the off-season program or will he be gone? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That still is to be determined.</p><p><strong>George</strong>: When the Steeler’s traded their 2020 #1 draft choice to Miami for Minkah Fitzpatrick to solidify their defense, why didn’t the Steeler’s try to obtain veteran quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick to solidify the offense too? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They already gave up a lot to get Minkah. They would have had to trade away more to get Ryan. Not that easy. This isn't fantasy football.</p><p><strong>Kevin</strong>: Conner, Snell and Samuels as the 3 backs in 2020? Cut Nix as he provided nothing this year to save cap space? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They need a FB. Otherwise, fine.</p><p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Biggest needs in the 2020 draft in your opinion? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Depends on Dupree, but to me its RB, TE, WR, DL, G</p><p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Do you think we really need to draft a RB in this draft? I'm seeing a lot of people talking about Taylor from Wisconsin maybe being the pick if he falls to us in round 2. We have more pressing needs IMO and Maybe Conner will shake the injury bug next season. Plus Snell showed promise as well. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes I do. And players who are hurt all the time do not shake the injury bug, as you suggest. They are known as injury prone and, as such, unreliable.</p><p><strong>Angela </strong>: Extend Ju-Ju or Conner before the season or make them play it out and risk a DuPree type season and losing them? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There will be no extension for James Conner.</p><p><strong>Alex</strong>: Any chance Pitt re-signs Hargrave? He did well in Tuitt's absence. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Sure there is. But that might depend on what happens with Dupree.</p><p><strong>Corey</strong>: If Pitt's update on Ben in February comes back negative, will he be released? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Next</p><p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Based on Tomlin's comments about the coaching staff do you believe he has opened the door to possibly letting Fitchner(sp.) go!!! PLEASE SAY YES, PLEASE SAY YES. PLEASE SAY YES!!! LOL <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He has coached with Fichtner a long time so my answer would be no. But maybe it will become a situation similar to what happens on defense where Tomlin has most of the control and Butler splits time working with the OLBs.</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: Living in Maryland I hear a lot about the respect Harbaugh and his team have for Tomlin and the Steelers organization. Yet end of game play selection by Harbaughs team after the Steelers seemed to have accepted their fate showed little respect. Is sportsmanship dead? Tomlin seems to be a take a knee on the 3 yard line vs padding numbers at the end guy. Harbaugh, an ass. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I would agree with you.</p><p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Hi Jerry- Thanks for the chat and Happy New Year. Interested in your opinion on WR room. Do they need more talent, additional depth or with #7 behind center, good to go? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Number 7 will make a huge difference. I like James Washington and DJ w JuJu. But I won't be surprised, nor would I object, if a WR was taken by the fourth round in the draft. It's a good year for WRs</p><p><strong>DirtWinston4Prez</strong>: Happy 2020 Mr. Dulac. The fancy passing game hasn't accomplished much in the post season over the previous 4-5 seasons with Ben. As well, the top playoff seeds and most of the playoff teams this year have a power running game. Do you think the Steelers can convince Ben to play a more power running game offense ? John Elway closed out his career with two Super Bowls based on a play action attack featuring Terrell Davis. Seems to make sense for Ben as well. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, it's not up to Ben, it's up to the Steelers to commit to that, which is why I think a No. 1 running back -- not just a running back -- is an offensive priority in the draft.</p><p><strong>Ralph</strong>: Don't you agree that future decisions on players should be judged by what you see on the game tapes, and not on being nice guys or buddies of coaches and/or players? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they already are. What makes you think they are not.</p><p><strong>Patriots Video Guy</strong>: With more than 90% accuracy I can tell you whether the play will be run or pass. Am I better than Randy? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No you cant</p><p><strong>Jeff Davenjay</strong>: I am convinced that Mason Rudolf is not a solid back-up for a Big Ben type offense. A back-up needs to be able to come in with less confusion and run the same offense. However, this year the coaches failed to provide a streamlined offense with a short passing / running game to help Rudolf succeed in long relief. The coaches had no plan B and stuck with the long passing game. Your thoughts! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Give the guy a break. Rudolf, as you call him, had never played in an NFL game before this year. He had one disastrous game with a bunch of young RBs and a bunch of young WRs. There wasn't a running back or wide receiver with more than two years experience!! Did anyone ever stop to think about that??</p><p><strong>Steeler Fan Dan</strong>: Once again, the Cleveland Browns are in turmoil. Could the Steelers benefit from taking a look at some of their pending free agents or players that have fallen out of favor with their organization. Specifically, LB Schobert (a tackling machine), TE Njoku and WR Higgins. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The only one who would make sense is Njoku, and he's hurt a lot. They got one of those.</p><p><strong>JimBob</strong>: When was the last time you've heard an announcer say "That was a well designed play" when the Steelers were on offense <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, JB, I NEVER hear a broadcast because I'm in the press box, so my answer would be never, which is not for the same reason you are seeking.</p><p><strong>putinbatch</strong>: i'm not saying our defense played well in the last game, but I think they played well enough to win. If i recall correctly, the D only gave up 1 TD, on a short field after the fumble. Also, i'm not saying Duck is great, but i think he's getting the short end of a stick because he got so little help from the coaches and receivers. My biggest complaint for this team is the coaches not putting our young players in positions to succeed. what are your thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, the part of your argument you didn't highlight enough, but touched on, was when you said young players. They didn't have a QB, WR or RB with more than two years experience. Digest that for a minute.</p><p><strong>Lee Baby Sims</strong>: It seems obvious that AB is toxic and off-limits, but is it completely crazy for the Steelers to look into reacquiring LB if the Jets are looking to move him? W need a good reliable running back, and LB is all that and more. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It is not as crazy as thinking they would ever consider bringing AB back.</p><p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: Opinions seem split among Steelers beat writers regarding the biggest need in the draft. Assuming they keep Dupree, do you think OL, TE, RB, "Other" is hope for that 50th pick? It will probably be "Best Player Available" though, right? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, I think it will be offensive specific. Don't get fooled by that "best player available" nonsense. It's the best player available at a position of need.</p><p><strong>odb</strong>: happy 2020 love the chats. why the resentment with artie burns? seems the steelers did him a favor by not releasing him. does he have a future in the nfl? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Maybe in the NFL, not with them</p><p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: We've had many drafts in recent years where we focus most of the early picks on defense. With the offense performance this year, if we bring Bud back, the needs on defense are much lower and we can focus early picks on adding to the offense. Is that the way management is thinking now? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Unlike past years, this will be offensive-oriented drafts. The only needs on defense are depth.</p><p><strong>Javiermmori1971@gmail.com</strong>: Hi Gerry. In hindsight even though the Steelers won't admit it do they regret dealing Dobbs and letting Landry Jones get away and out of the two who would you have rather had as QB after Ben went down? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Oh well....that's hindsight.</p><p><strong>Mike</strong>: Very disappointing end of season 2 years in a row.. I know is complicated to get draft picks correct, example getting T.J. Watt @ 30th pick was a GEM in 2017, in retrospect we had the chance to get TE Kittle instead of Bust Dobbs or get Lamar Jackson or Darius Leonard instead of Safety Edmunds.. can you imagine? Unbelievable !! Any comments Gerry ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nope. I like your comments. But that's the way the draft unfolds. Look how many teams passed on Tom Brady and Joe Montana, two of the greatest QBs of all time.</p><p><strong>Artie Bridge</strong>: So, what's your end-of-season evaluation of Bush and Fitzpatrick? My thoughts are that Bush seemed to have a quiet, not disappointing, season, but not up to the hype we heard pre-season and certainly not up to Shazier's play. And Minkah, while spectacular in his first 5 or 6 games, seemed awfully low profile in the last five. Your take? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Mine are not yours, that's for sure.</p><p><strong>Bob</strong>: What is the purpose of the "windmill"-like device some players have in their mouthguard? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You'd have to ask Bennie Snell. Maybe to breathe better?</p><p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: Status of MR? With surgery, will he be ready for OTAs, or will his first team drills be in training camp? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He should be ready for OTAs</p><p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: Any surprises so far on coaching changes around the league? Both those that got the ax and those that maybe should have? Why is Jerry Jones waiting to fire Garrett. Seemed like a forgone conclusion weeks ago. My theory: ego. Jones wants a full news cycle for himself and did not want to just be one of many announced on Monday and Tuesday. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You could be right. All I know is Cleveland needs to hire a a guy who has been a head coach, and a successful one, not these wannabes who last one year. Mike McCarthy is the perfect guy.</p><p><strong>Rich in NYC</strong>: Happy Near Year, Gerry. After J.K. Dobbins is gone, do you like any other running backs that the Steelers should consider if available? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The guy from Wisconsin aint bad.</p><p><strong>Tony Pizano</strong>: Hi Gerry, I know this has been discussed many times, but after thinking the Steelers wasted a bunch of money to pick up Dupree's option year it now seems like a must to keep him. What is your honest opinion of whether or not that will happen? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You heard Mike Tomlin -- is a priority, make no mistake. That means they will keep him. I agree</p><p><strong>Brian</strong>: Have you heard any rumors or rumbling about perhaps getting Andy Dalton from Bengals if the Ben rehab reports are not positive? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No</p><p><strong>Josh</strong>: The Steelers are on the clock round two who do they pick? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Joe Burrow if he's available, how's that.</p><p><strong>Jerry</strong>: I think Sean Davis is better than Edmunds. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think you see what the Steelers think.</p><p><strong>John</strong>: obviously there are some questions on offense even when ben returns especially wr and rb. do you forsee any moves in fa? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There are always, and still will be, moves in free agency. And they will be addressing the offense.</p><p><strong>Steve</strong>: Roosevelt Nix played 35 out of 998 snaps in 2019; why do they need him (or any FB) based on that usage? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, he was hurt a lot.</p><p><strong>Jeff M</strong>: Last season 3 pass rushers were tagged and then traded for high draft picks. I know the preference will be to keep Dupree, but if they can make it work with the cap would it be smart to still tag and trade him? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No</p><p><strong>Jeff</strong>: is banners natural position guard or tackle? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He is no guard</p><p><strong>GjSteel</strong>: Hi Gerry, if Bradshaw had the same surgery as Ben...shouldn't there be a backup plan?...after Bradshaw had the surgery...his career was over wasn't it? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's because Bradshaw 1) didn't tell anyone he had surgery, 2) didn't do the proper rehab. Started throwing in camp when he shouldn't have.</p><p><strong>andy</strong>: hey Gerry, you blocked me on twitter! Any chance you can unblock? @andymonnot <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I will, but if I did it must have been for a good reason. I block anyone who uses profanity. But I tried that handle you said and nothing came up. That correct?</p><p><strong>theon</strong>: Hey Gerry, Dupree hits ten sacks and everyone is rushing out to pay him like he's Kahlil Mack. If the team is going to pay him top dollar, wouldn't they be better off paying a proven FA who's done this for more than one year the same top dollar? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They are not going to pay him top dollar. They will pay TJ Watt top dollar. But that doesn't mean they won't franchise him.</p><p><strong>Showdog</strong>: With the Browns getting a new coach and the Ravens looking powerful do you think even if Ben returns they can win the North? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Based on what I see, Baltimore is going to be tough to beat for a couple years.</p><p><strong>Jimmie</strong>: The major difference between Rudolph and Hodges seems to be arm strength, not height. Agree? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It's both. There are other factors, though, too</p><p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: You were supposed to say no!!! lol Follow up question then... Do you see Fitchner(sp) as the problem or the injuries and no Ben as the problems for the offensive woes. They had no scores on their opening drives and i believe had their lowest scoring season in quite some time.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes since 1998. Didn't have a TD on their opening possession since last year's NE game at Heinz Field. Dreadful performance. It has to be looked at very seriously <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, that's enough time today. Probably go back to our usual Wednesday time slot next week. Bye now.</p></body></html>
