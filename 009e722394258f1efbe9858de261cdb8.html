<h1>Tree of Life synagogue says phishing scam spreading across country  </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Tree of Life / Or L’Simcha congregation is once again warning the public of a reactivated phishing scam circulating from an email account posing as “Rabbi Hazzan Meyers.”</p>
<p>In January, the congregation <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/01/17/Tree-of-Life-synagogue-pittsburgh-warns-phishing-scam/stories/202001170114" target="_blank">posted an alert</a> to its social media pages concerning people in Squirrel Hill, where the synagogue resides, receiving an inauthentic email that appears to come from Rabbi Meyers asking for a “favor.” The congregation said Wednesday morning that the scam has begun spreading nationwide.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately it has happened again and seems to be happening around the country,” a message posted to The Tree of Life / Or L’Simcha’s Twitter page read.</p>
<p>The alert asked anyone who receives the email to not click any links, respond, or take action, but to instead contact the congregation’s office.</p>
<p>The scam is looking to capitalize on those willing to donate to Tree of Life after an Oct. 27, 2018, anti-Semitic attack by a gunman who killed 11 worshipers from three congregations meeting at the Tree of Life synagogue building.</p>
<p>Anyone who may have received the email can also call the Tree of Life office at 412-521-6788.</p>
