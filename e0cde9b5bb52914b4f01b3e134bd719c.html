<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh confirmed on Sunday that a student at one of its residence halls has tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>In a statement, Pitt spokesman Kevin Zwick also noted that the school is aware of “other potential cases within the University of Pittsburgh community.”</p>
<p>Mr. Zwick said the university would not confirm how the student contracted the virus&nbsp;“out of respect for this individual’s privacy.”</p>
<p>“In regard to this confirmed case, we are following existing protocols and working with local health officials to support the affected student and help reduce the spread of infection to others,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Those efforts include: retracing the affected individual’s movements and contacting&nbsp;people who have had close contact with them; contact with all of those people have been made, according to the university; and cleaning and disinfecting areas where the student resided and areas they “visited for a prolonged period.”</p>
<p>The university says anyone still on Pitt’s campus who&nbsp;begins to experience symptoms should immediately call the university’s student health service at 412-381-1800.</p>
<p>In response to the virus, the university in recent weeks canceled in-person classes,&nbsp;halted all nonessential research and travel, moved most employees to a remote work status, canceled all university events and closed most facilities on campus.</p>
<p>Pitt is Western Pennsylvania’s largest university with 34,000 students, many of whom have <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/17/college-dorm-residence-refunds-coronavirus-COVID19-Pitt-Duquesne-Penn-State-Carnegie-Mellon/stories/202003170082" target="_blank">gone home for the semester</a> following the university’s efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Last week, the university began to move all students who are still on campus into residences with private rooms and individual bathrooms.&nbsp;</p>
