<h1>U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh will review materials between Giuliani and Justice Dept.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh has been chosen to examine any information supplied by Rudy Giuliani, a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, to the Justice Department regarding former Vice President Joe Biden and his family's activities in Ukraine, according to The Washington Post.</p>
<p>Attorney General William Barr confirmed Monday that the Justice Department had set up a process by which Mr. Giuliani would provide information.</p>
<p>It's not clear why the office of U.S. Attorney Scott Brady was chosen, although prosecutors in Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh FBI have handled high-profile cases in recent years involving Russian and Eastern European hackers and other cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Mr. Barr told reporters that his department will examine all information relating to Ukraine, including anything Mr. Giuliani might provide, and the head of the FBI said the information will be treated the same as information in any federal case.</p>
<p>Some legal analysts, however, expressed concern that Mr. Giuliani now has direct access to the Justice Department, to which he can provide information about a top Democratic rival to Mr. Trump leading up to the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>The Washington Post said two sources had said the material is being sent to Mr. Brady's office to evaluate.</p>
<p>The office declined to comment Tuesday.</p>
