<p>There were no new deaths as a result of COVID-19 in Western Pennsylvania, including Allegheny County, according to the latest data released Sunday by the state health department.</p>
<p>The number of COVID-related deaths held at 73 in Allegheny County, the same number that was reported on Saturday. The county’s number of cases grew by 13, bringing the updated sum since the first instance was reported on March 14 to 1,211 cases.</p>
<p>On Sunday. Pennsylvania reported 13 new deaths and 1,096 new cases, totaling 1,550 and 41,165, respectively, according to the state.</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s total cases to date include 1,177 confirmed and 34 probable, according to the county health department. A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to a statement accompanying the numbers.</p>
<p>Of the 1,211 cases, there are 213 past or present hospitalizations. That represents an increase of two individuals.</p>
<p>Among those who have died, 66 are confirmed (had a positive test) and seven were probable, according to Saturday’s update. “A probable death is one where COVID-19 is listed on the deceased’s death certificate, but the person never had a positive test for the virus,” the county said.</p>
<p>All deceased ranged in age from 42 to 103. Of that total, 84 was the median age of whose who died.</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s totals are the highest in Western Pennsylvania. Philadelphia County has the highest totals in the state with 11,152 cases and 272 deaths.</p>
<p>Nationwide, cases now total 943,865, and deaths have surpassed 52,000, according to Johns Hopkins University’s interactive count.</p>
